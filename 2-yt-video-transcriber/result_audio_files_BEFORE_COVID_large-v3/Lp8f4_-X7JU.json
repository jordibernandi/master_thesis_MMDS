            "text": "Howdy folks, Kel here.  Well, I've got a Punch Double Corona here, which is the standard punch.  It's not a Maduro or anything like that.  I enjoyed those Punch Grand Piros last year so much.  I thought that I would try some more punch.  I got these from JR or Cigars International.  I don't remember now.  It's been since last year.  And I've never had a Punch Double Corona before.  Not that I recall.  I mean, it's possible.  I may have had one.  But I'm not recalling if I have right off the bat.  So here it is.  You know, I'll put, you know, maybe I'll put the dimensions.  It's about six inches long by about a 49 inch.  It's a classic Churchill size, really.  And I just thought I'd do a little update for you guys.  I'm sorry I haven't been on much.  I haven't been putting videos up.  The sad truth is I've had videos I could have put up, but I don't know, either because of my working out and dieting or whatever.  I've been kind of tired lately.  I've been kind of feeling kind of low-key and not feeling like doing anything, let alone, you know, editing videos.  So I've been kind of lazy, I guess.  I think it's because I'm working out quite hard.  I increased my workout load.  I was doing, you know, legs in different workouts.  Now I do legs and arms together.  So what I'm doing is I do chest and thighs or tops of my legs on Monday.  Then on Wednesday I do back.  and hams and Friday I do my shoulders and my calves.  I was doing the legs separately on different days and So I add the legs in with the regular workout, which makes the workout longer.  So I'm doing like, you know, anywhere from three to five sets on my arms and on my legs.  Sometimes I do more on my legs.  I'm using legs as a rest.  I'll do an arm, I'll do like an arm workout and then I'll do, I'll go do legs and then I'll come back and do another different, like I'll do like the day I did.  since I did, since it's back and bicep today I I did pull downs and I went and did my my backs of my legs, hamstrings or hams, I guess.  Then I went and did, I did the pull to my chest, then did the backs of my legs again.  Then I went and did biceps, then I went and did my legs again.  I did that a couple of times.  So I was doing, I got my legs out of the way pretty quickly.  I decided not to do four or five, six sets of my legs.  One day I did, on my shoulder, I did nine sets on my legs, on my calves.  I really like my calves.  The calves look pretty good these days.  They poppin'.  So that's what I've been up to.  And I've been just kind of tired.  Kind of just not feeling like doing anything.  You know, I've been working out and running errands and doing stuff that I have to do.  But as far as, you know, getting anything done extra, I just have not felt like it.  And I think it's because I've been dieting every day.  I've been taking a cheat day on Saturday.  I'm not doing that anymore.  Now I'm not having the sugar on Saturdays anymore.  Like having a little sugar, I'm not having, I'm still, I'm just making a regular diet day.  And maybe I'm a little tired from it.  I don't know.  I know workouts are harder.  But I'm having some success.  Something kind of funny happened today.  I was in Costco.  I'm running more errands.  Well, first I'll tell you the other thing.  On one of my videos, it's not up anymore.  But I was getting like thousands of views on it.  And I... I made it private for a reason.  It's a long story.  But anyway, I had lots of people who aren't really from my channel coming to watch that video who aren't really subscribers.  And several of them made jokes about my television.  I had a big Magnavox TV.  It cost me $1,000 at Costco 20 years ago.  And this big Magnavox TV and they're making fun of it.  I didn't know anybody owned TVs like that with a tube anymore.  And it was really great TV in its day.  Great color.  Plus it's picture in picture, which means you can actually look at something on the VCR or something on the channel while you're watching something else.  So if you're watching regular TV and a commercial came up.  you could go watch something, you could flip it, and you could watch something on VCR or the DVD and still be watching that little screen down in the bottom right-hand corner to see if your show had started again.  I like that, and that's what I like about TV.  But it was $1,000, and that may not seem like much today, but in its day, that was a lot of money for a television, especially 20 years ago.  And Magnavox did make a pretty good TV.  I'm actually about another one, almost just like it, but slightly smaller.  When I was trading commodities, I would sit at my trading desk.  I had a triangle type, the one around me, kind of triangle.  I was sitting in a corner at the trading desk with two, anyway.  And I had my computer in front of me for watching the markets go by and things like that with charts on it, intraday charts.  And then I had a big television over here.  And then over here I had, well, whatever I had.  water whatever and you know i'm always didn't bring my water.  well i'll get it when i start making this video.  and anyway uh that tv just went blink like almost 20 years ago.  it's been that fact.  well more like 10 years ago.  15 years ago it just went blink on one day turn it on and the screen just went went black.  and that was it.  it's kind of it fixed but probably cost more to have it fixed.  it was worth and i didn't feel like spending the money.  so i never.  i i moved at the time anyway.  so uh that's about that's about time i moved into my bunker.  so I don't know if you know, but I live 75 feet below ground in an abandoned missile silo converted into a survival bunker.  Sure I do.  Anyway, so I just abandoned that TV.  But the big one kept working and working and working.  It's over 20 years old.  Like I say, it's probably over 20 years old.  And people were making fun of it on that stream anyway.  And so the other two nights ago, I had it on.  I was actually online watching something on YouTube or some other online thing.  And I turned around and it was just a black screen.  And I could get volume.  I could hear things, but I could not.  It was the TV.  I checked everywhere.  It wasn't the cable.  It was the TV.  I couldn't play VCR through it or DVDs through it, you know, whatever.  So it died.  And I'm not going to try having it fixed, obviously.  So I went to Costco last night and found a nice LG flat screen, 50-inch, which is much bigger, by the way.  Think about that TV I had, that Magnavox.  It's an old square TV, the tube is.  And so therefore now most television shows want to be in letterbox.  So it made the screen much smaller, and kind of a pain in the butt.  So I'm kind of glad it went.  I bought a 50-inch TV now, and that will fit in that spot over there.  And that's going to be great.  It's a flat screen, of course.  So I think all those people on that stream who made fun of my TV jinxed my TV.  My TV got mad and decided to quit on me just as well.  I've been waiting for it to die for a long time, but it just hung in there.  Anyway, what happened at Costco today?  I looked at the TV last night, thought it might be the one, but I wanted to go look at Walmart too.  Wally World, of course.  And I found when I got one home that the one at Costco was the right one, but unfortunately they'd closed.  In fact, they were closing while I was even there.  So I couldn't have bought it if I wanted to.  It was there after the closing hour looking at it.  So I called this morning and asked them to hold it for me because they only had one left.  It was on sale.  They only had one left.  So I called them and they pulled it for me.  And I went back today and did some Costco shopping and I got the TV.  Well that was Costco shopping.  I was trying to find Kleenex once again.  These idiots keep changing where the Kleenex goes.  It just annoys the hell out of me.  And I think it's because it's lighter.  They can move it easier, but just annoying.  Anyway, so I find the Kleenex.  And then I thought it was that lotion Kleenex, the big, you know, with lotion.  I don't want lotion in my damn Kleenex.  And I was cussed about that to myself on my breath.  And I heard someone say, hello, Kel.  And I'm like, what?  I look over and I didn't recognize it at first, but it's a friend of a friend.  It's not a friend of mine really so much.  not a friend of ours he's a friend of mine.  he's not a friend of mine but a friend of ours.  however that goes anyway.  but uh he's a friend of a friend who's not really a friend anymore anyway but he's a friend of a friend friend of what used to be a really close friend of mine.  and he's kel how you doing.  and i looked over and i said what's your name?  again you know he told me his name.  i felt kind of embarrassing but i only saw him.  that's when i saw him was 10 15 years ago maybe more.  He looked exactly the same.  This guy never changes.  He still looked pretty young and he got some gray hair and stuff.  But he said, my God, you've lost a lot of weight.  The thing is, he saw me how I looked on that video probably eight, nine years ago I made in the back porch where I was probably 300 pounds.  I'm not realizing the time I was in.  I didn't realize I was that much actually until recently here.  Because for the last two or three years I've been like 140, 144 pounds.  Last spring, summer, I was like 227, not 144, 244.  Last year I was probably, I was 227 at the doctor's office here like last spring.  I don't know what I am now, but I have been losing weight still.  I don't weigh myself because it gets me all upset and freaked out.  I act like a fool and get freaky and upset.  Also the fact that I'm putting on muscle, you know, girl, girl lifting.  I'm putting on muscle.  You know, if you're putting on muscle and losing fat, you know, you may stay the same.  I don't know.  But I have lost weight in my pants.  I've had to adjust the belt in my pants probably four times, at least maybe five.  I just did it again the night before last because I was walking around the store and it was falling off my butt.  It didn't fall down, but it was that funny feeling where you feel them creeping down on one side especially.  So... He said, man, you look really great.  Wow.  He was really shocked.  I don't feel that much different.  I have that body dysmorphia thing I think people have where when I'm fat, I feel thin.  I don't even realize I'm really fat.  That's part of the problem.  And when I'm thin and losing weight, I still feel really fat.  Though I do have looked at myself lately in the mirror, and I am definitely thinner, plus my pants are looser.  I've got several.  I've got a couple other jackets, one of which hasn't fit me for over 20 years or longer.  And that That fits again, you know, barely, but it fits.  So I've definitely lost weight, and that's how the workout's going.  That's where I've been.  I'm sorry I've been kind of out of frame, what do you want to call it?  I've been kind of missing in action.  I've been wanting to get videos, so I just have just, probably because I'm losing weight and working out so hard, I just have just felt kind of low energy and just kind of, I don't know, not really, I'm kind of tired today because I only got about four hours sleep last night.  Had to get out to Costco to get this computer and I didn't get to sleep until like 9 or 10 this morning or later, you know, and woke up at like 2 o'clock and thought, well, damn it, I just better get up and go work out.  And I went to Costco first because I didn't want to miss getting this, not a computer, the TV.  So anyway, that's all I've been doing and what I've been doing.  I'm sorry I've been missing an action, like I say.  I feel bad about when it gets that way.  I just felt, I haven't smoked any cigars.  If you're wondering, I haven't been cheating on you.  I haven't been smoking any cigars.  This is the first cigar I've had.  for, you know, weeks, really I've been wanting to, but it's been cold here.  It was like 74 degrees today.  And that's the warmest we've had for weeks and weeks.  In fact, just the last couple of days, it was like 60.  For a few weeks or so last month, it was like 60 degrees, 65.  And then it got cold and rainy and cold for the rest of May.  It pretty much was rainy and cold and awful and really wasn't cigar smoking weather.  So that's what it's been.  And I apologize for being missing in action.  But things are going well, pretty much.  The way they should go.  I'm losing weight.  I'm working out.  Getting things done.  I need to get done.  Except for editing videos, quite obviously.  But I'm really tired now.  I feel like falling asleep.  I feel like taking a nap.  But I haven't taken a shower yet since the workout.  So I really can't take a nap yet.  I can't go to sleep yet.  So I want to.  And I've got to have someone help me.  move that massive television out of my room so I can get the flat screen up.  The flat screen is still in the truck as a matter of fact.  So I'm waiting for someone to show up here and help me do that.  I can't move that TV on my own.  It's that big and that heavy.  It's a monster.  I kind of want to get that flat screen up tonight because I haven't had TV for a few days, you know.  It's funny.  I really enjoy television and you don't realize how much you enjoy it or how much you are addicted to it until you don't have it anymore.  That almost sounded like somnolence.  Holy God.  It was almost like withdrawal symptoms last night.  I kept wanting to turn around from my computer and watch some TV for a few minutes and check on something, and I couldn't.  It wasn't there anymore.  It doesn't work at all.  It even stopped putting out sound, as a matter of fact.  It did that first night, a little bit of sound, but no picture.  Probably the most boring story I ever told.  Well, Thanks for watching.  Hope you enjoyed the video.  Hope you enjoyed this little update.  I'm sorry I've been missing in action.  I haven't died or anything.  I've been feeling good, you know, pretty much, except from just the last week or two.  I've just felt really, it's a growing sense of just feeling kind of tired.  And it's probably from dieting so much.  I don't think, I'm not following, I'm not eating so little that I'm going to be in, you know, starvation mode where I don't lose weight or anything.  I know I'm eating enough.  But the diet's working really good, by the way.  um calorie the calorie deficit.  i i'm i'm eating a calorie deficit pretty much every day now.  um and and usually fairly right i'm usually pretty much right in the nose to what my fitness palaces i should be eating.  i don't follow that much but they did give me a calculation which was pretty much what i already figured out on my own.  and uh i'm still still fasting i'm i'm still doing fasting i'm doing the circadian rhythm.  Sometimes I figured to enter it into my Xero app on my phone, but I'm still doing that.  And some days, like today, I was like probably at, I don't know, 15 hours before I actually ended up eating.  So I go over that a lot of times.  Sometimes I go under it.  But I'm still doing that.  And that's still working.  But maybe the calorie deficit is what's really working.  I mean, like, if I ate too many calories, I still wouldn't lose weight, even if I was, you know, fasting, intermittent fasting.  So... Well, anyway, that's it.  Thanks for watching.  Please subscribe if you haven't already.  I'll keep you up to date on the diet and everything else going.  It's going good, you know.  I'm hoping, you know, in the next, I'm hoping by, you know, September, October, September, November, October, September, October, those, that area to be where I want to be weight-wise.  But maybe not, because I surely grossly, grossly underestimated how much I need to lose and how fast I was going to lose it.  I thought I could lose a couple pounds a week, two or three pounds a week.  I thought by June I'd be in the kind of shape I want to be in, but that just isn't happening.  And here it is almost June.  This is being made on the 29th of May.  You know, so I'm obviously not going to be in shape in June.  And maybe not.  I mean, I'm taking it, you know, I realize I'm only going to lose what I'm going to lose.  So, you know, I mean, for the amount of calories I eat and the amount of workout I'm doing and everything else and the rest of my life, my activity level, I'm only going to lose how much I'm going to lose.  I can't, you know.  And that's what I'm going to lose.  And it's not, you know, it's probably a pound a week, maybe a pound and a half a week, some weeks, I don't know, a pound and a quarter.  And that's fine.  I wish it were faster.  It seems like it's taking forever, just so you know.  It just seems like it's taking forever to lose this weight.  But I was a lot heavier than I realized I was.  In the past, when I would lose weight and it seemed like it was over pretty quickly, first of all, I wasn't really doing a calorie count every day.  I was just eating like no sugar whatsoever and I was eating a very, very, you know, just vegetables and whatever, diet.  And therefore, I didn't really count calories.  I wasn't looking at it every day.  And it kind of just happened without me being aware.  But now I'm actually counting calories and watching it.  And also back in those days, at least the more I'm thinking about many years ago, when I did that, I was probably as fat as I am right now when I started dieting.  So I started from where I am now.  And six months or so, I was pretty thin.  I was probably more active back then too.  But it's going to happen how it's going to happen.  And that's just the way it is.  And I hope it's, I hope I'm in, I mean, I'll be in better shape by August, you know.  I'll be in better shape by August, no doubt, and that'll be nice.  And, you know, I'll be in better shape in a month now.  I mean, every four or five pounds, you know, makes a difference, you know.  And I'm at the point now, like I say, where clothes are certainly sitting me a lot better, and all my shirts, and I've got coats that I couldn't wear before, and all that kind of stuff.  So it's getting better, and I feel better, except for being a little tired these days, a little bit low energy.  You need to smoke more cigars.  They'll give me a little more energy, maybe.  Well, that's it.  Thanks for watching.  You know, click the bell, all that kind of stuff.  And subscribe, please.  And share the video with a friend if they're fighting the weight problems or the health problems as I am.

I just have too much money.  I'm going to just give it away to somebody.  I'll throw it at Kelly, I guess.  That would be great.  Well, thanks for watching, and I'll talk to you later.  I hope you're enjoying your life and your cigars and your dieting and your workouts because that's what it's all about.  I have been enjoying the workout.  The workouts lately have been harder, and I've been working harder and doing more effort and doing harder and doing more, so they aren't as enjoyable as they were.  But I know I'm making good progress there, so I will talk to you later. ",
