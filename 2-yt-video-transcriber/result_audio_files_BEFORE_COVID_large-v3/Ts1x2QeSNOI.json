            "text": "Marcus Limonis, the host of the CNBC show The Prophet, runs a couple companies called Gander Outdoors, Gander RV, and Camping World.  Marcus Limonis' company sponsored a horrifically cruel contest slaughter of pheasants at the Minnesota Horse and Hunt Club in Pryor Lake, Minnesota, in April 2019.  The cage-raised birds were first incapacitated by literally shaking them senseless.  then placing them under some brush, and minutes later they were set on by dogs.  Most birds could not, or in any case would not fly, even as they were mauled by the dogs.  Some of the birds were tossed in the air and shot, Others weren't even killed.  They were stuffed into jackets or merely tossed into piles to suffer prolonged and painful deaths.  Shark tried to persuade Limones to terminate his sponsorship before this slaughter, and we shared the cruelty we had filmed a year earlier.  That footage persuaded the sponsors of the 2018 slaughter, such as Carrier Corporation, Nutrisource, and the local BMW dealership to get out.  They did the right thing.  We shared video documentation with Limonis after the slaughter.  There was no response from Limonis before or after the shoot.  No statement whatsoever has been made about why he chose to sponsor this psychopathic abuse.  He could have stopped before it happened.  He could have stopped after it happened.  Yet, nothing.  A few weeks ago, shark president Steve Hindy went to the headquarters of Camping World in Lincolnshire, Illinois, to see if they had actually watched any of sharks' videos.  They were aware of the issue and had seen the footage.  The obvious bottom line is that Marcus Limonis just doesn't care even the tiniest amount about animals, or ethics, or common decency.  If Marcus Limonis thinks egregious animal abuse will ultimately make money for him, he will support it.  He sacrificed his moral integrity to sell his brand to a handful of fake hunters.  But the story doesn't end there.  There's a lot more to Limonis' lack of integrity.  Search Marcus Limonis scam or camping world complaints.  Doing so will yield a treasure trove of disturbing articles about Limonis' business practices.  We will also include links to some of those articles in the description section of this video.  Limones and Camping World have come under fire for allegedly scamming customers purchasing RVs from them by overcharging and tacking on unnecessary fees, a move that could easily fool first-time buyers and rob them of thousands of dollars.  From allegedly taking advantage of the small businesses featured on his show, The Profit, to outright financial fraud, Marcus Limones demonstrates he doesn't care any more about people than he cares about animals.  At this point, Shark doesn't want anything from Limonis.  A statement from someone so completely devoid of good character is worthless.  At this point, we just want the world to know what a bad guy Marcus Limonis is, and in service of that mission, we will work tirelessly for years and years to come.  If you care about animals, or people, and especially if you care about yourself, don't spend your money with Gander Outdoors, Gander RV, and Camping World.  And please don't watch CNBC's The Prophet.  There's plenty of other garbage TV to stare at.  that at least doesn't include a psychopath as its star.  Thank you for watching.
