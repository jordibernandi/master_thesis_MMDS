There's also the fact that it mentions the suffering servant being crushed repeatedly, and the Gospels make it quite clear that not a single bone of Jesus' body was broken.  But let's set aside all these little quibblings for the moment and assume, for argument's sake, that the character of Jesus, as depicted in the Bible, fits that prophecy perfectly.  So what?  Also assuming that Jesus actually existed and was crucified, it really isn't that hard to write a narrative around a known prophecy from past writings that would make any death by crucifixion match up with the prophecy.  And the Romans were not exactly just reserving crucifixions for special cases, it was a common method of execution.  So we have a man with followers who is executed in a fairly common way.  Then, as time goes on, the story grows, as stories do.  Details are then added in, details that the storytellers would have no way of actually knowing, like the private conversation Jesus had with Pilate.  They didn't even have to be consciously lying about it.  The people embellishing the story could have fervently believed that every word they were saying was true.  And the more they think about the story, the more it seems to fit with this well-known prophecy from Isaiah.  And subconsciously, their brains work to make it fit even better.  This is something that we know our brains do.  Our brains don't remember events by memorizing every word and every action that took place.  It creates what is known as a gist memory.  Rather than remembering all the nitty-gritty details, it just remembers the overall concept and emotions of the event.  And what's more, when you recall past memories, your brain will rewrite them with current information, updating your old memories with new experiences.  So every time Jesus' followers think back to the day of his execution, they don't remember the specifics of the day, because that's not how our brains work.  And their experiences since then, like for instance maybe making the connection between Jesus' death and the suffering servant prophecy, get added into those memories.  Then, after 30 years of misremembering, details get written down that did not actually happen, but which could very well be honest recollections from the people most concerned.  And it's more likely even farther removed than this, with the stories being passed down orally, being misremembered by many different people before finally being written down.  So yeah, the suffering servant passage might have been significant if Jesus' story was confirmed to have been written down during his lifetime, and had been written in a way that couldn't possibly have been fulfilled by anybody else.  But since all we have is a long line of hearsay passed on orally for 30 years before being written down, it doesn't look all that convincing. ",

After seeing something like that, I don't think that most people would have had a problem with just one more guy being raised from the dead.

It's quite possible that he had some buried feelings of guilt about what he had been doing, which resulted in a psychotic break, where he hallucinated about the leader of the group that he was persecuting.  Paul makes it quite clear that he received everything through revelation rather than through direct communication with any people.  When he saw Jesus on the road to Damascus, then depending on where you're reading, the men with him either didn't see anything or they only saw light.  If they saw nothing, then it looks like a mere hallucination.  If they saw light, then it still looks like a mere hallucination combined with human problems with memory that I outlined earlier as these men tried to make sense of their boss's sudden change of heart.  Either way, hallucinations look to be most likely.  The rest of his video is just him preaching that lives get changed when you believe in the resurrection, which doesn't ultimately matter to me.  So that's it for me.  Today's comment of the day comes to us from Gavin Riley, who says, Well, lots of people can wiggle their ears.  Would that make those ear muscles non-vestigial for those people?  That was on my video where I pointed out that humans have vestigial ear muscles that actively try to turn our ears toward loud, unexpected sounds.  People that are able to wiggle their ears are most likely able to do so because of an atavism, a reactivating of a vestigial feature, as it were.  It's still a vestigial feature, it's just one that can be used to get attention at parties and whatnot.  So remember to follow me on Facebook and Twitter and support me on Patreon.
