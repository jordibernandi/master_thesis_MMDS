Bernie is someone that I share incredible values with.  And as you know, we have been doing a lot of work together.  We introduced our student debt cancellation.  And this week we introduced another revolutionary bill together to make sure that there are universal school meals for all of our kids.  You know, when I think about Bernie, I think about someone who's not building, who's building a movement and not just running for president.  There was an America that I dreamed about.  There's an America that I think we deserve.  And Bernie is the only one who shares that vision for the America we all want. ",

And I asked you if Bernie Sanders should run for president again.  And you said, quote, I actually believe that ship might have sailed.  I asked you what you made of Elizabeth Warren, and you said, quote, I think I would be excited about a Warren candidacy.  I've always thought of myself as part of the Warren wing of the party.  What changed for you in the 12 months since then? ",

We think we're the smartest in the room.  We are very policy oriented.  We care about the details.  And there is that aspect of Warren that is exciting.  She has a plan for everything.  But there is, I think, an expansion of what universal values are and how we should be thinking about what kind of revolutionary ideas this country needs in order for these structural changes that Warren talks about to be implemented.  And that person who will carry that out is Bernie. ",
