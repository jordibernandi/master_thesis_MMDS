            "text": "Hello, beautiful people of the world.  Welcome back to Donna's Devos.  I know, I know it's been a while since I've done one of these, but I'm super excited because this next Donna's Devos is something that literally I've had to walk out in my own life.  So these tips that I'm giving you today are directly from my own experience and something that I'm actually in the process of walking out myself, if I'm being completely honest with you.  And you know, I like to come on here and be as real as I possibly can be with you guys.  And you guys actually gave me the idea for this Devo because I went on my Instagram and I asked all of you at home, what kind of Donna's Devos would you like to see next?  And one of you guys and a few other ones mentioned this topic that I think is so crucial and vital.  to our walk with God because we're all gonna deal with the season of waiting from one time to the next.  So today I'm gonna give you three tips on how to maximize your season of waiting.  And if you wanna hear what tips I have for you, please keep watching.  And first off, I just want to say that we all go through these seasons of waiting, whether it be waiting on the Lord for a job, or waiting on the Lord for an answer to your prayers, or waiting on the Lord to deliver you from a situation that you hate, or waiting on the Lord for your healing.  Whatever you're waiting on the Lord for, we all have to deal with these seasons of waiting.  And I don't want you to be stuck in that season.  I don't want you to feel like there is no hope because I want to tell you right now that there is hope.  And even in those seasons where we are waiting on the Lord, He can still speak to us.  He can still encourage us.  And you can still have an amazing life even in your season of waiting.  and i want to tell you that i'm actually in one of those seasons myself.  you know i'm waiting on the lord for some answer to my prayers and in the season of waiting the lord has really spoken to me and he's taught me a few things that i want to share with you.  now i'm not sitting up here and saying that i know it all or that i have it all together because i don't i would be lying if i said i did but i do know that god has shown me a few things that i want to share with you and i hope that in this journey that we are in together, that we can encourage each other, build each other up, and help each other get through the season of waiting.  Tip number one is stay active.  Now, what do I mean by stay active?  I don't mean, I'm not just talking about going to the gym and working out and being active in that way.  That's all great because that creates endorphins and we need endorphins in order to live a more fulfilled life.  But I'm talking about staying active in the pursuit of God.  So what does that look like?  That means that you're staying active in reading your word and you're staying active in meditating in his presence and allowing him to just fill your life because I promise you that if you're not growing spiritually, you're dying.  And when you're dying spiritually, that is, you become a target.  You become a target for bad things and for darkness.  And you don't wanna be in this funk where you're just dark and down and out and you're allowing you know things that shouldn't be in your mind to be in your mind and the only way you can prevent this is by staying active in the pursuit of god.  tip number two is grab a hold of a scripture.  now one of those days iris wants to join in on the vlog.  no iris excuse me a minute okay where was i?  grab a hold of a scripture.  so one of those days when i was staying active in the pursuit of god i felt god speak to me like never before.  you know he gave me a scripture that I've been able to hold on to.  And I kid you not, this scripture has been life and healing to my bones.  Without this scripture, I don't know how I would have made it through this season of my life.  Because it's tough to wait on the Lord sometimes.  And I want to share this scripture with you in hopes that it will encourage you in your season of waiting.  And the scripture is in Psalm 7120.  And it's something I committed myself to memory because I need it so much.  Every single day, I say the scripture over my life.  Every single day that I wake up.  And the scripture says, though you have made me see troubles, many and bitter, you will restore my life again.  From the depths of the earth, you will again bring me up.  You will increase my honor and comfort me once more.  And it is such a beautiful scripture that I've been able to hold on to because right now I am.  I am in need of that.  I know that I've seen many troubles, but God is going to restore my life again.  And so in your season of waiting, you need to have a scripture that you hold on to.  And if you don't have one, I want you to pray about it.  I want you to ask God to reveal a scripture to you that you can hold on while you wait on the Lord.  But I also want you to put yourself, to make sure that you are doing your part by putting yourself in situations where you will be able to hear from God.  And I promise you he will be faithful to meet you there and give you that scripture that you can hold on to in your season of waiting.  Tip number three.  Now, before I say this tip, I know some of you are going to cringe at me, but it's okay because we're in this together.  My tip for you today is to be patient.  And I know, I know, I know it's easier said than done, but I'm telling you from experience because that's what I've been having to do in my own season myself, you know?  And I know it's hard sometimes, but we just have to be patient because you know what?  Our ways are not his ways and our thoughts are not his thoughts and he has a plan.  No matter what it looks like, no matter how hard it may seem, God has a plan.  If you could just be patient and wait, I promise you, He will reveal it to you.  I love what James 1.4 says.  It says, Let patience have its perfect work, that you may be complete and perfect, lacking nothing.  And as I started meditating on the scripture, I thought, what if when God is talking about in his word that he will perfect that which concerns you, what if he's really talking about perfecting something inside of us?  And if he is perfecting something inside of us, then we can be patient, right?  Because patience is one of the fruits of the spirit.  You know, let patience have its perfect work, that you may be complete and perfect, lacking nothing.  You know, when we pray and we ask God, Lord, make me more like you, we're really praying to be perfect.  You know, the Bible says, be perfect like I am perfect, like Jesus is perfect.  and so God is trying to perfect us and a lot of times we're going through things you know because God is either trying to teach us something or he's trying to test us.  maybe he's showing you something about your character that you need a fix or maybe you know he's increasing your faith.  because I'll tell you one thing in this season of waiting where I've been waiting on the Lord for some answered prayer i have known god as my provider more than any time my entire life because he has been supplying every single one of my needs.  but i've been able to see god as my provider.  so my question to you is what is god showing you in the season?  What has he been teaching you about this season?  Has he been showing you how to have faith?  Has he been showing you how to trust him?  Has he been showing you how all of your needs are met?  Because the Bible says that he will supply all of your needs according to his glorious riches through Christ Jesus.  And that's something that I've been learning in my own life.  And those are all my tips for you today.  I want to thank you so much for tuning in to Life with Donna Vlogs.  I pray that you were blessed by this edition of Donna's Devos.
