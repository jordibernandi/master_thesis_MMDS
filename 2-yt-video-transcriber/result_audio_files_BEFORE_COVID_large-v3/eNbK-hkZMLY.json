            "text": "Good morning.  Good morning.  I'm so happy to be here on this exciting morning.  As you may or may not know, I've been all over this Epstein case since 2005.  It was only a local story in Palm Beach.  The chief of police, this all originated when some 14-year-old girl in West Palm Beach somehow fell into the cops' hands.  And, no, I guess it was her mother went and reported it to the police, saying there was a billionaire in Palm Beach who was paying her daughter to come to his mansion and have sex.  So the Palm Beach police staged this top secret, absolutely incredible, at least six-month investigation.  They got 17 of the child victims to sign affidavits, some of the procurers.  they were watching epstein's house collecting his garbage for six months.  they got the affidavit from the house.  man uh... saying things like you know after the fourteen-year-old girls would be there on they'd come.  so all of this after this really spectacular investigation the palm beach police are are very good.  surprisingly for a small town uh... but there's a lot of money in that town.  they take it to they get the um... during the prosecutors are called state attorneys in florida uh... buried pressure uh... hola i was the one just you know footnote spent three years tormenting rush limbaugh over-the-back pain medication which okay it's a violation but to be getting all that national publicity over it.  and and there were some outrageous things done in in that regard anywhere delayed buried crusher And I mention this particularly to counterbalance the political angle that's being taken today.

            "text": "Well, there was one lonely voice in the woods pointing that out long ago, Jillian.  I believe it.  So Barry Krischer, big Democratic prosecutor, gets all this information and sentences Epstein to probation.  Probation, he only charges him with one attempt of attempting to solicit prostitution, thus labeling the 14-year-old girls prostitutes.  Chief of Police Michael Ryder goes mental.  He starts, you know, talking to the press, and he says, I'm going to take this to the FBI.  Well, okay, note here, all of the crimes that they had found, based on the mother in West Palm Beach, all of the crimes are state crimes.  i mean people always think you know the fbi can go after anything right at this point.  nobody knew about the island there but there was no evidence on the new york on the new york offenses.  these are state crimes.  so so the fbi handed over to alexa.  alexa costa uh... who is now trumps labor secretary as you will hear ten times a day uh... a cost that could have done a better job in his prosecutors could have done a better job but what they ended up doing And I think this should be looked at, don't get me wrong.  They came under enormous pressure from, as you say, and I was pointing out when Hannity was trying to turn this into an exclusively Democratic scandal, among Epstein's dream team of attorneys was both Alan Dershowitz and Ken Saar.  When you have that kind of money, you can hire a whole dream team.  And they're threatening, they're calling up the prosecutors, looking into their personal lives, Acosta's office ends up getting Epstein.  There's a plea bargain.  He agrees to plead guilty to state charges, because again, that's all they have at that point.  State charges, and he'll be sentenced to, I don't know, whatever it was.  It was supposed to be two years or something.  All because they're state charges.  That gets sent to whom?  Back to the Democratic state government of West Palm Beach.  It is the county officials, and again, Barry Krischer, who decide how that two-year term is going to be spent.  uh... he ended up as i'm sure you've heard he ended up spending sixteen months just as a certain number of hours per day in the county jail in his own private wing with his own private bodyguards.  he could spend i believe it was twelve hours a day back on his mansion on palm beach.  now the and part of the settlement agreement is the crucial part uh... The prosecutors agreed, took a non-prosecution agreement against the lawyers, all of Epstein's friends, procurers, everyone else involved, including Alan Dershowitz, and other lawyers involved.  So Paul Cassell, brilliant lawyer, comes along.  He happens to be, and this is why Hannity used to describe this pretty much exclusively as a democratic scandal.  No, it is not.  uh... but paul cassell it is.  it is a big uh... crime victims right advocate and i believe helped write the law.  it's a federal law.  it's only a federal law.  uh... work with crime victims saying look we want the same rights as criminals.  we want to know after we've been victimized what the prosecutors are doing through the fact that uh... accosta's office the u.s.  attorney's office for southern district of florida the fact that they struck this somewhat lenient not As horribly lenient as the state charges.  Quietly, though.  We've got some jail time, but without keeping the victims informed. ",

I'm more dubious of the Hollywood types than I am of international, well, powerful people.  I think the most interesting things, two things about this case are, number one, where does Jeffrey Epstein get his money?  My theory, but my theory doesn't count for it all.  We know it's not because he's investing money.  He was a high school math teacher.  This guy Wexner grabbed him.  Oh, you're a genius.  And suddenly, the amount of real estate and private planes this guy has, it is billions of dollars.  You're not privately investing anything without ever moving the market.  That is clearly untrue.  My theory was that he was the concierge of this underage... Sex club, so to speak, and wealthy men paid for this.  But, you know, this is kind of a niche sexual fetish. ",

Epstein, according to both the girls' accounts, he wanted them to have sex with powerful men, come back to him and report on it, describe what they wanted, what their fetishes were, and he had cameras throughout the house.  So this is obviously for blackmailing purposes.  It just seems to me there is a bigger, something much bigger is behind this, perhaps a state sponsor, powerful enough people for, as the evidence I described for the original state charge, Forget, you know, Democrat, Democrat, Republicans, whatever.
