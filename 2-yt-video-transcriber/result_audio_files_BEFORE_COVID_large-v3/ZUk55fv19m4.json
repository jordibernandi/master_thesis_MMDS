Everybody who I spoke with later on the night, because I was sharing the story a few times, Christ Sophia, are you familiar with that term?  Nobody knew what it was, which meant, told me, like, I have to open up and share this.  Christ Sophia is the woman Christ.  It is the female Jesus.  It is the embodiment of Christ in woman.  And that is an ancient Gnostic and Greek mystery school tradition and philosophy and teaching and energy and person that was written out of history.  after the Roman Catholic Church or the Roman Catholic Empire the Holy Roman Empire took over and destroyed all of the Greek and Gnostic mysteries and philosophies and wrote them out of history.  And so the Christ Sophia has really been lost for so long. ",

He asks a bunch of people, and then he finds out what it is.  And then conveniently, he has already read a book about Christ Sophia and is willing to send it to you.  Interesting.  Very strange that he already has read a book about this, and he knows what Christ Sophia is.  Very fucking weird.  How do you...
