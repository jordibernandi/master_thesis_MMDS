Why would there be any need to put a dirty cop back on the force?  Well, of course, but why?  But you're a member.  Why don't you stand up and say, guys, why are we reinstating bad cops?  See, there's the problem.  Okay, we have a member who knows what they do is wrong.  jeopardizes the city, jeopardizes the citizens, yet won't speak up and say, why are you guys doing this?  Why do we need a dirty cop back on the force?  The city already fired them for rape, for drug offense, for misconduct, but yet the FOP arbitrates and it has a 90% win rate when they arbitrate for a bad cop.  Why?  Well, it's all because of dues.  It's all because of money.  It's all because of this and that.  So when cops say they're good, It may be in their heart, but in their soul, they don't do good things.  They don't show good things about standing up.  Look at Andre Boyer.  You guys may have heard of Andre Boyer.  He was an ex-Philly cop who was a whistleblower, and the FOP sued him because they didn't want to have the truth out about what he was blowing the whistle on.  And, you know, I know it's tough when fellow blue liners don't want you to go against a corrupt officer.  That's not true.  Well, I hope it's not.  Because the FOP... ",
