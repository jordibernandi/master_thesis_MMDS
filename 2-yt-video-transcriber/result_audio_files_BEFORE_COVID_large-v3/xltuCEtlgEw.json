            "text": "Hello.  Good morning.  I am finally free from my commitments for the rest of the year basically for this next month and a half.  If you guys have seen any of my other recent vlogs you'll know that I finished the Story Magic Academy running it and creating it about a month ago now, like mid-October.  I had a huge workload for a few months doing that and I got very burnt out.  so I took two weeks off and then as soon as I came back to work I had a workshop to work on.  I delivered a workshop on storytelling, it was for women in STEM.  and so it's actually not really for like fiction writers.  it was about like real life storytelling.  So I had a ton of work to do for that like creating it, making my slides, I had a workbook to make and then I delivered it just the day before yesterday which was new for me.  so I was a bit nervous but it seemed to go quite well and that means that now I'm finally done and I can get back to writing and doing whatever else kind of work stuff that I want to do.  Writing and making videos I think are the main things I would like to focus on for the rest of November and for December.  but because I've not had any space in my brain for that recently now that that's finally over I'm kind of like switching gears I suppose and I'm making this kind of transition into a different kind of work and a different schedule, different kinds of work days and stuff.  so I think I want to take today to kind of take stock, do a bit of a reset, figure out how I'm going to organise myself going forward and also catch up on a bunch of the tasks that I have been kind of ignoring or putting off or haven't really had time to focus on in the last week or so because everything has just all been about this workshop that I was doing.  So I bought a ton of replies for texts and emails and all that kind of stuff, among other things.  So I'm going to take you along with me today as we try and get all of my ducks in a row and all my shit together to start writing again tomorrow.  That's the plan.  But first we're having second breakfast.  Because apparently one breakfast is just not enough for me anymore.  Okay, so I have just spent a bit of time first doing like a mental inventory.  It's a tool which is part of the bullet journal method, which if you read the book, the bullet journal method, you will already know.  It's kind of like a brain dump or like a pensive.  You are just downloading everything that you can think of.  that you need to get done at some point.  And so that they're not just kind of all just swirling around in there.  So what I like to do is to do that big brain dump, try and download and get out every single thing that I can think of that I want or need to get done sometime in the near future.  And then I take that and I use a prioritisation grid to kind of filter out the most important things and give me an order in which I need to do them.  So I've got priority one, two, three, etc.  It just really helps me focus on what's actually important instead of getting distracted by lots of things that I want to do or that I think it would be really nice to have done.  Um, but which ultimately aren't as important as my priorities.  Um, so I've done kind of, I guess like the heavy lifting and now it's time to write that up into some kind of format that I can use.  Um, usually this would just be in my bullet journal in my kind of monthly lists.  Um, but obviously we're mid month because I'm doing this kind of.  refresh, switching gears, planning out what happens now that I'm kind of free floating after having completed a bunch of projects and I'm also just finishing my bullet journal.  I mean I guess it would probably make sense for me to just set up my new journal and then transfer like all the stuff, all the tasks that I've prioritised and stuff into that.  but then setting up the new journal is probably kind of a time-consuming process and I don't know if I want to like basically spend the lion's share of today doing that.  so I'm trying to figure out kind of what to do for that or if I should just maybe write write up my final lists like onto just a piece of paper for now and work off of that and so that I don't have to yeah do my bullet journal?  hmm yeah so setting up a bullet journal like I'm definitely gonna make it quite minimalist so it shouldn't actually take too long.  but I would like to you know take stock of my existing one and make sure that I'm transferring over anything that I actually want to and I'd like to give that process the time it deserves and also just because I fucking love doing things on paper and I love bullet journaling and Transferring over into a new one like starting a new one starting a fresh notebook.  It's like kind of fun for me as well It's kind of exciting so I don't want to like kind of rush through that and when I know it's something that I actually enjoy as well like if it's useful and I enjoy it I might as well let myself do both.  and and I think what is actually more important than that is Basically figuring out what my kind of schedule is from now on like how am I organizing my writing and creating some kind of regular but manageable video schedule which is twofold both so that I'm actually doing enough videos for my YouTube channel but also to make sure that I'm not doing too much because it's very easy for me to procrastinate on writing by like throwing myself wholeheartedly into videos because they're very much like kind of instant gratification compared to writing and so don't want to.  so I want to have like a kind of set schedule and both so that I'm doing enough but also not too much and I'm not using it as a way to procrastinate from writing and I also kind of need to think a bit more long term about both my patreon and the next semester of the Academy which will be in 2020 and making sure that I'm not got what I need prepared for that when it arrives.  I think the best thing to do because like literally setting up my new bullet journal is one of my tasks which I have prioritised.  so I think the best thing to do is actually just to kind of collate this stuff just on paper just on some loose paper instead of in my journal yeah and then take a look at like what the kind of order is and just work through it that way instead of trying to prioritise in my head instead of just using the prioritization stuff that I have just created.  Let's do that.  Let's write it up on paper.  Okay, I've finished writing up my final list of all my tasks for the moment.  I don't even really know how long this is going to last me, or how long I'll use this for.  This could last just for the next few days, or it could be for the next few weeks.  We'll see.  If you guys are interested in this prioritisation grid, thing, like the way that I figure out which order in which to do my top priority tasks.  I'm thinking about doing a video just on that, so if you would like that or if you're interested in that, please let me know in the comments.  and I will make it a priority.  But yeah, just roughly, I guess, to walk you through this list.  The idea with this is that I basically divided everything I want to do or need to do into three tiers.  We've got the top priorities, so the absolute most vital things I definitely have to do and which often have deadlines attached to them.  And then we have stuff that's still important, that still matters, but isn't quite as urgent.  So it doesn't have a deadline.  I would like to get it done at some point and it's still important, but it doesn't need to be done like absolutely immediately.  It's not a top priority.  It's that kind of like mid level.  I've got that as next priorities and then I've got low priority.  So this is stuff that I definitely want to do but I have evaluated it and deemed it not a top priority at all right now.  So it's things which are gonna probably act as distractions.  So I definitely don't want to be doing those instead of my top priority things.  although if I get to them then that'd be great.  So the idea with this is that I'm only ever working on one tier at a time so I only get to move on to the kind of mid priority tier once I've finished all the top priorities.  And I only get to move on to the low priority stuff once I've finished all the mid priority stuff.  So I kind of have to work through it roughly in order to make sure that I am focusing on what is most important and what actually needs to get done and not a bunch of stuff that doesn't really matter at all.  So that's the general idea.  After writing this up, I do feel a lot better and kind of more clear and focused, which is exactly what I wanted to come from this.  So that's great.  I'm not sure what I'm going to do with this list.  I might just like tape it up somewhere.  maybe on my fridge or just keep it by my laptop or something since it's not in my journal.  I'm just going to start with the first one that I've got and work my way through and see how much I can get done today.  It is twenty past one.  so yeah we've still got a fair amount of time and yeah we'll see how much I manage to get through.  Lunch has been had, a break has been had and now I'm trying to figure out where I'm setting up to do this work.  Having sat at that coffee table for quite a while already today I'm starting to be like, I would like a wheelchair please.  So thinking about going out.  Ross went in the gym this morning and It's now like 2pm and he's still not back and I know he's meant to be working on music stuff today.  so I don't really know what he's doing out there or what's going on.  I kind of forgot about him to be honest for a while there.  I was just like working away or having lunch or whatever and yeah I was like oh yeah Ross he was meant to come back at some point but he hasn't.  so yeah I think I might text him and see if he has a plan and then figure things out from there.  The first thing on my list is to catch up with all my messages and reply to all my texts and look through the most important emails and just get back to everyone who I need to get back to about things.  That's the first thing because that's quite overdue.  And then I'm looking at my kind of planning ahead in terms of more of like a schedule like these are like my immediate tasks but I want to figure out how I'm going to balance my writing and videos and then yeah potentially looking forward to that next semester of the academy.  and then I've got some follow-up things to do with that workshop that I did and so I need to send them the slides that I used and invoice them.  So to kind of try and sort out my new work pattern is what I'm calling it, I guess, like my schedule, balancing my different projects or focuses over the next few months, I basically just did a huge mind map, which was quite productive in a bunch of different ways, although I still don't feel like I've completely nailed it or managed to nail down exactly what I want to do.  It's quite complicated.  because there are different deadlines for different things like some things I want to be doing like on a daily basis or a monthly basis or like on a longer term basis than monthly.  so yeah figuring that out is all a bit complicated and I don't think I've like cracked it entirely but I've definitely like done a lot of it I think.  so I'll see how I get on with that.  I think I may have stretched my brain a little bit too far today trying to do all that kind of like heavy lifting sort of brainstorming mental processing stuff.  normally I try to do that kind of stuff in the morning and then save the afternoon for kind of lighter easier tasks because like I don't have finite brain power every day.  I think we've done alright.  it's been a nice productive day.  My motivation kind of wavered a little bit in the middle there but on heading out and getting back to it I definitely can turn things around.  So tomorrow I am off work because I've got an event to go to but I think The day after that is when we're going to put this new work pattern into practice and get down to writing and some videos and things.  So, goodnight, happy Friday and I'll see you soon.  And into my fire. ",
