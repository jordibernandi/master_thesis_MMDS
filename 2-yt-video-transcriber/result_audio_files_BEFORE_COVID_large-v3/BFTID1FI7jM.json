            "text": "What is going on, guys?  So you may notice that my voice is a little croaky.  I'm actually sick today.  I'm bedridden.  But I didn't want to wait until tomorrow for this video because I came across this article title and it was such complete bullshit, such gynocentric crap that I had to bring it to you.  RAF pilots are taught... And by the way, RAF is the Royal Australian Air Force.  our airborne military.  RAF pilots are taught to think of women during bombing.  Yeah, how badly can that go, right?  We need to train combat warriors, not social justice warriors.  Air Force pilots are taught to think of women and consider gendered social roles during bombing operations in war zones.  No, gentlemen, this is not a drill.  I am not fucking with you.  This is actually real.  Royal Australian Air Force pilots are taught to think of women and take a gender perspective during bombing operations.  The gender in air operations doctrine informs pilots what they should do before dropping bombs in war zones to ensure that women are not placed in danger.  It gives the example of how much destroying a bridge used by enemy troops could force local women to walk further to fetch water or wood.  Although destroying this target may provide a military advantage against the enemy, the second order effect may mean that, due to the gendered social roles, women need to travel further afield.  On unfamiliar and less secure, well-known or well-lit routes to gather water and firewood, the doctrine said.  Oh my god, there might not be as much light.  They might stub a toe instead of getting bombed.  Like all the men that they don't give a fuck about.  Australian Peacekeeper and Peacemaker Veterans Association New South Wales ACT President Bruce Ralph said the program will also protect pilots.  Oh, I wonder what kind of mental gymnastics they're going to throw in there to try and justify that statement.  The program has been designed to encourage a new way of thinking in which vulnerable women aren't at an increased risk of violence or threat.  This is going to make their pilots hesitate, afraid he might be charged with war crimes.  And that puts his life in danger because the enemy will not be hesitating to shoot him down, he told the Daily Telegraph.  However, former army officer Bernard Gaynor said, We need our defence force to train combat warriors, not social justice warriors.  The sooner defence returns to its core business, the better.
