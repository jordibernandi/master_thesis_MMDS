            "text": "Meanwhile, on the Hill yesterday.  The House Judiciary Committee heard testimony from former White House Counsel John Dean, who was obviously Richard Nixon's White House Counsel, went on to write extensively about Nixon and about authoritarians in our government.  That was 10, 15 years ago.  He saw that the Republican Party was actually turning authoritarian Saw the indications of that happening.  And he's been brought on various capacities as a commentator.  I'm not sure I fully get why.  I understand the sort of the thinking, but it really is one dimensional thinking and clever, too clever by half, I think, by the Democrats to do this.  But it may be the best that they could do with Nancy Pelosi.  And we will talk about Nancy Pelosi.  We have that clip of her at Pete Peterson.  Oh, God.  Anyways.  So in lieu of.  Of impeachment hearings, we're getting this, which is apparently just to set the table.  Now, of course, it did create some attention.  And wherever there's attention, there is milkshake.  Mac gets.  Matt gets loves a slushy on a hot Florida day.  He is from the Florida panhandle.  And.  Here he is questioning.  John Dean.  He doesn't do a terribly good job, but he does get humiliated.  And how do we know that Matt Gaetz felt he got humiliated?  I will tell you after the clip. ",

What's even more important than my assessment that they all laughed at Matt's Gates is Matt Gates's assessment that they laughed at Matt Gates.  And how do I know that Matt Gates felt they all laughed at him?  Because there is no intern in Matt's Gates office who would have made the decision on their own to edit that video and release it and hide the fact that John Dean owned Matt Gaetz in this exchange.
