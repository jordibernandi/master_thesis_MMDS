There will be a praying president, not a religious one. ",

I was overwhelmed by a strong presence of hatred and bitterness permeating from the citizens of the United States of America.  When I sensed this, I sensed I was literally tasting the bitterness.  Not that would only come, but that is present.  And God was so grieved.  That politics and the economy and the news media has put us in a position where we are completely corrupted in our hearts.  And bitterness is coming forth.  instead of praying prophetically, calling out to God.  Lord, I pray today with your people.  I call to you, Lord, because you have shown me New York.  You've shown me New York.  You've shown me, Lord, how the enemy has once again planned something.  But this time it is completely different.  It is not like 9-11.  There is nothing like it.  This is the most strange infiltration that shall come upon your screens.  It shall come upon you in your movie houses.  It shall come upon the places of comforts.  and pleasure and they shall infiltrate and they shall say we'll even black them out.  we will even cause them to be so terrorized because there is darkness in one section and darkness in another section.  canada keep your shield in front of you do not let it down but they are focusing on you.  spirit of god says.  one more thing.  i want to talk to you about that little dwarf In North Korea.  I'm getting a little tired of him.  I think I'm going to go pay him a visit, says the Lord.  You watch and see what I do.

And I must tell you, it's just amazing what's unfolding already.  God told me to go to New York, and I shared, of course, before that.  when the Spirit of God leads you, even as Paul was led, sometimes it's not very clear.  But the dates changed slightly for New York, and just before I left, I said to my team, I need to meet with some leaders, and specifically felt that I should meet with Donald Trump.  We're about to leave now and I found out that he's just announced that he's going to run for president.  That is important to me because when the Lord leads me to put my feet on the ground, in any region there must be a reason for it.  So Neil, I don't know what your feelings are, but you're standing with me just before we get off the flight.  Maybe you could just share a little bit. ",

You know, I'm being told by our team, who's updating us now about Donald Trump announcing his candidacy for president, that the motto he's using is, Make America Great Again.  And you're going to the very soil where 9-11 took place, where the enemies of America tried to deal a permanent blow to puncture the heart of America.  But we're going back there now.  Your boots are going back there now.  And as you have prophesied, indeed, America is resilient.  So I'm very much looking forward to seeing what comes forth on this trip. ",
