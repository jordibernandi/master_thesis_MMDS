So each one has its own unique set of challenges.  That's better.  I like transforming everyday objects that we just sort of overlook, that's so simple to not think about.  Straws, just kind of taking some of those and transforming them into things that remind us of the natural world.  There's just something about that that is like a sweet spot for me.  When I do my work well, I go to a place, a performance, and I see people get activated in a way where they're believing that some creature or some story is coming to life in a very real way for them.
