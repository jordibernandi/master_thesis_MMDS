            "text": "I'm Roy Potter, a former U.S.  Army Lieutenant Colonel.  Welcome to the Potter Expos\u00e9.  Hi ladies and gentlemen.  It is the evening of the 15th of February 2019.  I'm Roy Potter.  Welcome to this segment of the Potter Expositor.  I was going to do a live stream, but I'm having some problems with that because I thought some of this needed to be discussed.  But I've gone ahead and just recorded this.  And I'm going to upload it.  Hopefully it'll get up before too late, so I don't want to make this too long.  You know, I was really concerned, and I still am, that Trump signed that budget and border deal.  He didn't just declare a national emergency.  He signed that horrible, horrible thing.  And everybody knows how bad it is.  And you already know how I feel about it.  I'm not going to hammer that anymore right now.  What I am going to say is that you know for how long now have I been saying that Trump needs to act?  Well, I want you to watch this clip from Bill O'Reilly and what he says because it exactly is what my sentiments are.  And I think a lot of us feel the same way.  Now, as far as the declassification of all that material, I suppose I can kind of think ahead on this.  And if Trump is thinking about putting this through a criminal trial of some sort, he probably wouldn't want to put that out yet.  I wouldn't think.  It's basically evidence.  I'm just guessing that that's the reason why he has not declassified that. ",
