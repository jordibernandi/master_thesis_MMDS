            "text": "Hey, it's Tyesha and I am here with another great video.  What I want to talk to you about is this documentary that I watch called Root Cause.  I was made aware of this documentary by an article that was shared on Facebook that Netflix had actually pulled this documentary from Netflix.  their lineup and i'm like wow okay it's that controversial because i just watched the documentary that was talking about.  you know um the different sides um opposing and those who are for circumcision.  it was called american circumcision.  i was going to do a video on that.  i just didn't know how to package it up and present it.  and you know videos like that on my channel.  they're automatically demonetized.  So yeah, I was like, let me figure out a way to get this across YouTube.  So if you want me to review that documentary, it's on Netflix, American Circuit Citizen, give the girl a thumbs up, comment below.  And let's say we get this video past, let's say 50 thumbs up, I'll go ahead and do it.  How about that?  Let's go ahead and talk about Root Cause.  Root Cause is a documentary where it starts out where a gentleman... He lost his front grill after an altercation.  As a result, he had to get a root canal.  Ultimately, he ended up developing different issues with his body, such as loss of energy, sadness.  impotence, you know, a lot of things, so he tried a lot of new age things to reverse that, and after he tried so many things, and it was so funny how they put that in the documentary, you have to watch it, he showed how he tried cupping, yoga, tarot card readings, you know, all the stuff that's new age is out there, and I said, let me know too, if you want me to start talking more about that stuff on my channel, because you know your girl is not in religion, so you know I've been nibbling and dabbling in some stuff, you know, As it came down to it, the cause or, you know, where all this, the root, where all this stuff has stepped from was his infected root canal.  And pretty much in this documentary, it's showing how Your tooth, when you have a root canal, that is a dead tooth.  That is something that has died, but yet it's still in your mouth.  And your body tries to fight that off.  You know, it tries to fight off the infection, fungus, you know, and get rid of that thing that has died.  And they compared it to, let's say, you know, you have a bad appendix.  They go remove the appendix.  You have, you know, a gangrene limb.  They remove that because it's going to continue spreading until it takes over the whole body.  What was interesting about this documentary, Root Cause, is how it connected your teeth to different meridian points in your body, such as, you know, certain teeth may have a meridian connection to your spleen, a connection.  The one thing that shocked the hell out of me was how I was saying, now I want to know, I want to know, you know, if there's actual people who could shit, they're going to police.  Slow the hell down.  Okay, I'm good.  if there's, I was going to speed limit, I'm good.  If there's an actual connection, there are studies in this documentary.  Ruka showed that Women who had, you know, a malignant tumor in their breast had a root canal on the same side.  I'm like, what?  Yes, that was really mind boggling.  And I'm like, wow, it kind of makes sense because I remember, um, When I got my wisdom teeth pulled, and I only had my bottom wisdom teeth pulled, I didn't need to.  They wasn't rotten.  And I'll go on record and say, well, I did it.  You know, when I was in the military, I was being worked.  They worked me to fucking death when I was in the military.  And so I'm like, look, I need a couple of days off.  I need some time.  I got my bottle of whiskey taken out.  I had a weekend to bleed into my pillow.  And then I had another week of light duty.  Yeah, I did that because it was working the shit out.  And so I still have my tops.  And when I talk to the people who have had their wisdom teeth at the top removed, they're like, when they removed it, it felt like something connected to my eye broke.  And I'm like, whoa, I don't need that because I don't want my vision to change or anything like that.  So my upper wisdom teeth are not bothering me.  So we just chilling.  But they were saying how when people get wisdom teeth extracted or just any tooth extracted for that matter, just pulling out the tooth is not enough.  You have to get the tooth removed and include the ligament that attaches the tooth.  And then you also have to clean out that socket so that infection... And other bacteria is not growing in that.  And I'm like, wow, because by that being trapped in your gum, it'll start eating at your jawline.  That documentary, like, it just had me like, uh, you know.  Check out the other documentary reviews on my channel, such as What the Health?  I have no idea what on that one.  And I'll keep linking them up here.  All you gotta do is just click on them and check them out.  But yeah, oh my gosh.  So it reminds me of this book that I found at the thrift store.  And I'll put a picture of that because I don't have it here with me, of course.  I found it at the thrift store and it's called Dental Secrets, I believe.  Dental Secrets.  And... In this book, as well as the documentary Root Cause, it was saying how certain, like, tooth fillings are not good.  They highly recommend, like, a ceramic filling or a ceramic bridge or... filling your tooth with zirconia.  i did not even know that that that was an option.  but these materials are less likely to cause an adverse reaction with your body to where your body starts to fight it and tries to get rid of it.  and if it's like um When people get like breast implants, and so the body tries to attack this foreign item that's inside of it, or if you have like a cancer or an illness, your body is so smart, your body is so brilliant that it realizes that this is a foreign agent, you know, in this body, and your body sends out, you know, the white blood cells and every other resource to attack it, contain it, and get rid of it.  Yeah.  So that same thing happens in your mouth, you know?  Yes.  Oh my gosh.  It was just like, wow, this is crazy.  So what has this documentary, you know, done to me and inspire me to do better?  First of freaking out, it has encouraged me to take care of my teeth.  Check out my video up here on my teeth whitening routine where I show you how I use activated charcoal and different things to brush my teeth.  You know, I make those changes.  I don't know if... Tell me if you can verify this, but I know when I was a little girl, we were always, you know, it was recommended to brush our teeth three times a day.  You have three square meals.  you brush after every meal, if not more if you want to.  However, I'm noticing nowadays it's recommended to only brush twice a day.  I don't get it because just about everything we have or everything that we consume has sugar in it.  And everything has sugar from your cereal to your ketchup to your drinks.  Just about everything has sugar.  check your toothpaste for sugar too.  You know, but I'm like, I'm at a point like, when did it become two times a day?  Shouldn't it be three?  So it's really inspiring me.  You know, I carry a travel toothbrush with me.  However, I am carrying the little travel bottles and I put peroxide in that because I brush with peroxide.  And then also too, the tap water in my area is really trash.  It's real trash.  Check my video up here about the toxic tap water because when you're brushing your teeth your gums bleed.  sometimes that's you know an open line to your bloodstream.  and if the water is toxic to where?  in my area here in Seattle a woman had used a neti pot and she got a brain eating amoeba and she died.  so if I'm opening up my bloodstream to tap water I don't drink tap water I don't cook with it.  So why am I going to open up my bloodstream to tap water and let whoever knows what all these pollutants get in there?  That's how it's changed me.  Ensure, ensure, ensure you are brushing those teeth, cleaning those gums, because I know as well, I was reading this a while back, and it If you fail to floss and take care of your teeth, it has a direct relation to your heart.  It has a direct effect on your heart.  So for your heart's sake, take care of your teeth.  Nowadays, I notice people and the first thing that I look at when I meet people is your teeth.  You know, I see people that have like, I think just take a picture of me.  Okay.  Anyway, first thing I notice is your teeth.  I'll see people who have, like, chewing tobacco all up in their gums and don't brush their teeth.  It smells bad.  Teeth are discolored.  Just yuck mouth to the fifth power.  And that's one thing I just noticed, and I'm like... whatever capacity that you're in, you know, and I know this might seem unfair and it might seem mean, but when I go to a, well, I don't really go to them nowadays, but when I go to a fast food restaurant and the person there, you know, they teeth are rotten and shit.  And I'm like, I'm not going to eat this food.  I don't want my teeth to look like that, you know?  And I know that's kind of mean, but if I put it this way, if you're in a position where you deal with the public or you're selling a product or products or represented something, and you have a yuck mouth, like I can't even trust you to get up out the bed and brush and floss your teeth, but you want to sell me something that sort of better my life, I kind of charge them to the game.  I'm not buying your product.  I'm not giving you my money.  I'm not trusting you in my care.  Yes, that's just how I look at things.  I'm real conceited.  Now that your girl is out there dating and stuff, that's one of my pet peeves, my turnoffs.  I can look at you and tell that you don't floss.  And I can tell if you don't brush, you don't scrape your tongue.  Yeah, so I will quickly charge to the game and you won't see me a second time.  But yeah, Root Cause is a great documentary, and I hope that you check that out.  It's here on YouTube.  I shared a link for it on YouTube.  Make sure you go check that out.  I saw that it was available, I believe, on Amazon Prime for like $12.  so i'm gonna go ahead and put that in the description as well.  you can go ahead and check that out.  but yes um take care of your teeth man and then also too you know if you have feelings that are um that may contain those those uh ingredients i told you about.  you know go to your dentist get that stuff checked out.  do what you got to do.  as far as that you know.  and once the the the main character of the documentary the um the writer Once he got his root canal removed and he just got a bridge or something, they put a bridge in, over time, the impotence, the low energy, the depression, things like that, all of that It disappeared and he's living a full life.  He is cooling and chilling.  So I'm glad I really like people who have like, you know, not so great things happen in their life and they take that and they're able to impact other people and use that as a learning experience.  I really like those types of stories.  You know, that's that's why I have this channel here.  And that's why I have my other channel, Surviving Military Domestic Violence.
