Antisemitism was rampant in Shakespeare's England.  Officially, the Jewish population had been expelled from England since 1290.  When he wrote The Merchant of Venice, he likely wouldn't have known any actual Jewish people, though he would have known Christopher Marlowe's even more hateful play The Jew of Malta, which includes a bit where the title character poisons an entire nunnery.  And he was also, like Shylock, a moneylender.  The stereotype of the Jewish moneylender had its roots in actual economic reality.  Since Christians were forbidden from practicing what they considered usury, or charging an interest, and since the Jewish people were barred from owning land or joining guilds, moneylending was really the only professional option left.  As for the actual character of Shylock, moved to greed after repeated insult, he is one of the most difficult characters to play.  For most of his early history, the character was done with a bright red wig, comically, broadly, though sympathetic portrayals could have been seen as far back as the mid-18th century.  But it's a difficult character to play.  Nobody is wild about staging this play.  Even the Nazis weren't wild about staging the play.  Not because of Shylock, but because of the fact that Shylock's daughter Jessica converts and marries the Christian Lorenzo.  Nazis.  But most, if not all, modern productions place Shylock for pathos.  The play retains the structure of a Shakespearean comedy.  All good parties married off by the end, with the lone antagonist ousted and humiliated.  But modern audiences can't ignore the tragedy of Shylock's character.  Denied his justice and denied his revenge, forced to abandon his wealth and his faith?  History gave him a pathos that isn't present in the text.  Well, except for that speech. ",
