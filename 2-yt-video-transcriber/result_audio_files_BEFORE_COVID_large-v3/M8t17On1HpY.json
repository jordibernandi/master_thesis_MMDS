It's about the political landscape that a Labour Party would have to inherit.  I think that ever since 2008, we've seen that this model of sort of soft centre-left, centre-right, beige politics, it's been completely discredited all over Europe.  So any party that wants to do well in this country dealing with the state of people's household finances will have to offer something different.  What I don't understand, and I think this is also why they're not so keen to launch a party straight away, is because the policies that they would have to offer run against the current of public opinion.
