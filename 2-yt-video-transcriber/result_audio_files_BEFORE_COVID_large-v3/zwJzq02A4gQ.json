            "text": "Hello all, welcome to the Truth Show and in this video I will be talking about the younger actress on Black-ish named Marseille Martin.  As a mother I have to speak, I have to speak because something just isn't right.  Let's talk.  Kayla Marseille Martin was born on August 14, 2004, in Little Elm, Texas, even though I've heard that she was born in Plano, Texas as well.  She is the daughter of Carol and Joshua Martin.  Her acting career started after a glamorous pictorial photographer gave them a discount in exchange for her father's promise that he would submit the photos taken to talent agencies.  After her photos were sent out to four agencies, one of them immediately signed her.  Then at age five, she landed her first national commercial.  Details regarding her history still remain largely unclear.  As of 2019, Marseille is homeschooled.  so as to concentrate on her fast-growing career.  Yeah, you heard it correctly.  Heck, lately she has landed into dozens of TV projects, among which included a brand new role at the ABC pilot series, Black-ish, which we know.  Importantly, the producers had auditioned over 100 people, but after Marks had read her lines, they knew they found the perfect match.  Through the series' entire five seasons, she would display exceptional skill, which was unlike any girl her age.  When asked about Marseille, blackish creator Kenya Barris described her as a little ball of talent wise beyond her years.  Rather talented or skilled, she no doubt surpassed everyone's expectations, which led to her being nominated for numerous awards and nominations.  Marseille Martin was nominated, you see, for six NAACP Image Awards and Two Screen Actors Guild Award under Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series.  She eventually grabbed two NAACP Image Awards and one Young Artist Award.  She was also featured in, I'm talking about her movies and things, she was also featured in As Young Girl on tape in the 2016 film Nina, then as Melody Ellison in the 2016 film An American Girl Story, Melody, 1963 in Love Has to Win.  Then as Hannah in the 2017 Femme Fond Mom Dinner.  And then as Kira Anderson in the 2017 Short Femme Lemonade Mafia.  The list goes on and on and on.  I'm not going to read all of them.  Anyway, yeah, her father is her manager.  And yes, he... She's supporting the entire family at the age of only 15 years old.  Her family setting is also set with chores to do and instructions to adhere to.  I mean, they try to keep her grounded and humble.  Besides schooling in her home, they try to do this.  Her parents try to also keep her activities close to that of a kid from a normal household setting.  This is what they're saying.  She isn't allowed to have a boyfriend yet because her parents want her to concentrate on her career and her education.  I just bet they do.  Her idol is Beyonce.  She even met her at the White House Easter Egg Roll.  With that being said, I just have something to say.  I just do.  Now as you can see, the very talented and beautiful young girl has a very bright future.  She's only 15 years old and she's already ran makeup.  She was ran makeup long before that and is prodding out already and she was prodding out long before 15.  I mean, just saying.  And many young girls are known to do that.  I was one of them.  But what I'm worried about is what Hollywood and the greed, what will it turn her into and her parents into if not already?  Will this be another Lindsay Lohan story or a Macaulay Cochran or Gary Coleman?  The list goes on and on.  I mean, will the money that's supposed to be stored in the trust fund for these young actors and actresses?  Will it be there when she turned 18 or 21?  Will she end up with nothing like Gary Coleman and Macaulay Culkin?  I mean, I checked her Instagram and her father is literally pimping her.  I mean, pimping the heck out of her.  If you want to call it that or supporting her, I don't know what you want to call it.  I mean, it's not Matthew Knowles.  I think that relationship between them two are a lot different.  I just pray that this young talent whom I see great things for stay safe and think smart.  I mean, Hollywood has a way of turning young children into things I can't mention on here.  I mean, just like they did Amanda Bynes and they did Drew Barrymore at some point, the Olsen twins.  I mean, I pray for success and a lot of peace of mind.  And maturity and open-mindedness and humbleness.  And she stayed grounded and her eyes are open.  I mean, that's what I pray.  Well, that's it.  Tell me your thoughts below.
