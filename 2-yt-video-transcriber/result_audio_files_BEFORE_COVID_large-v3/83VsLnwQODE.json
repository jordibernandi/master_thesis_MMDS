Yeah, I'm really kind of hurt giving you're supposedly my friend.  So I thought you would know me better.  But the topic should be addressed at another time.  Amaranth is hurt.  That Vibes would dare be offended by the fact she just dropped the N-bomb.  Casual as fuck.  Vibes, you're the asshole here.  How dare you make Ammo feel any level of guilt?  You filthy pay pig.

Is Kotaku, Polygon, and all the other gaming websites going to pick up on this and call Amaranth out?  Because I remember when PewDiePie dropped the N-bomb, his ass was hung out to dry.  PewDiePie was completely shaken up by the mainstream media.  They beat the shit out of Pewds.  Didn't he lose his YouTube Red show on top of that?  So, what's gonna happen here, huh?  Is AMREF gonna get the same thing?  Are they gonna drag her?  Drag her.  Slay her.  Sipping on that true tea, hunty.  Gag.  For real, is anything going to happen?  Because if the major publications don't pick up on this and give her the same crap PewDiePie got, I'm personally going to call them out on it.  That's for sure.  I mean, I don't care, really.  I heard that word so much, especially used towards me, that I don't care anymore.  But what I do care about is Twitch enforcing the rules.  What I do care about is the mainstream media putting her under the same scrutiny and irony as PewDiePie was under.  But then again, nothing's going to happen.  I can't believe people are sitting.  I didn't hear the word.  I didn't hear her say that.  Come on.  You heard that shit.  Why is everybody playing?  Because as a woman, we're just going to now like... brush it off, you know she's not going to get banned.  I'm pretty sure the most that'll happen is Twitch will give her maybe a three-day suspension, most likely one, at the most.  I'm pretty sure there's someone who posted a tweet where somebody was streaming transsexual porn on Twitch.  And the title was Education Purposes.  And it had a picture of Amaranth and Alinity up.  And the video stayed up for over an hour.  Until, like, Memology was tweeted about it.  Then Twitch took it down.  It's hilarious stuff, bro.  I might do that on my chats.  I'm going to take a picture of, like, Alinity and put it in the corner.  When I think something bad happens, I'm going to do that today.  I'm going to make my Alinity shield.  Oh.  I'm gonna get banned. ",

Oh, she's just playing a rerun of ASMR.  Amazing.  Simply amazing.  Why am I saying it's amazing?  I cover Twitch all the time.  It's a normal day in Twitch.  I'm surprised anybody's surprised by it.  I said it before.  Amaranth or Alinity, they'd have to kill someone on stream before they'd be in any form of trouble.  They would literally have to commit homicide.  And even then, Twitch staff would still leave her page up for a day or two and wait for the police report.  We know that she appeared to have killed someone on screen, but we weren't sure if it was a bit because we know Amaranth likes to do little cosplay and jokes and whatnot.  Jesus Christ.

Gonna need it.  Also, follow me on all social media.  But the way YouTube is changing, I don't know if I'm gonna be here.  You know what I'm saying?  Like, they might just implement stuff that people will abuse to get rid of me, and nobody gives a crap.  I'm a straight man.  I better pretend to come out of the closet or something real soon to save my ass.  So, check my description.  It's full of places you can follow me.  Everything from Twitch to Twitter to Instagram.  I have a bit shoot.  You can find It's a Gundam everywhere, baby.  Finding the voice is the whole thing for the character.  You just can't come into this, you know, and, uh, you don't not have a voice.  Yeah, I mean, Heath Ledger, when he did the Joker, he couldn't start until he had the voice.  And until we have the voice, I feel that this character is, uh, it's on, it's hinging mainly on the fact that it's dark and satanic and a very dark time in human history.  Hmm.
