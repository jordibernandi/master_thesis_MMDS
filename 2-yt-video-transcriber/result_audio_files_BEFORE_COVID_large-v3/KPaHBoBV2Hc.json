            "text": "Hey guys, welcome to Religious Bullshit with Dusty Smith, the show where we take a look at the five craziest religious stories of the day and then immediately try to forget what we've just witnessed so that we don't end up bleeding ourselves out in a warm bathtub.  As always, we have a horrible show for you today, so let's fucking do it.  And today we're going to start it off with this story.  Did you guys hear about this one?  About this fucking dickhead preacher who's given the eulogy at this kid's funeral and basically insinuates he might be burning in hell for eternity.  Apparently the parents met with him and told him what they wanted.  They basically just wanted him to celebrate the kid's life.  But instead, Father Don LaCusta decided to get up there and mention suicide six times.  He told mourners that Mason may be denied a minute into heaven because of the way he died.  LaCusta wondered aloud if Mason had repented enough in the eyes of God.  Because that's what you want to hear at your kid's funeral.  Who knows?  Maybe your son is suffering in an eternity of torture right now.  Oh well, guess he shouldn't have killed himself.  The parents said he basically called their kid a sinner and they actually had to walk up on stage and ask him to fucking stop.  But apparently this asshole, Lacusta, kept going to the point where these parents had to disinvite him from the gravesite.  What a fucking dickhead.  And this story actually hits home for me because something very similar happened to me at my dad's funeral.  Here's a picture of my family and my dad.  And it's kind of weird because on the day my dad died, I called him and I just happened to ask him what he wanted us to do when he died.  And it's creepy because he wasn't sick.  We weren't expecting him to die or anything.  It was a complete fluke that I just happened to ask him on the day he died what he wanted us to do with him.  And we discussed it, and he told me that when he died, he wanted to be cremated and have his ashes buried under a Fuji apple tree.  You see, even though I was raised Christian, my dad wasn't around a lot, and he was a lifelong atheist, and he fucking hated the church.  And he also couldn't fucking stand the local pastor at my grandmother's church.  Thought he was a giant fucking dickhead, which he was.  And so the last thing he wanted was a traditional Christian burial.  So of course, I told his side of the family exactly what he said he wanted.  And what did they do?  They had a traditional Christian burial for him, of course, with the same exact fucking dickhead he hated presiding over it.  And during the funeral, this motherfucker starts talking shit about my fucking dad.  He's like, oh, you don't have to tell me about Terry Smith.  I know all about Terry Smith.  I know about backsliding and not living your life of Jesus.  I know all about that.  And then he says, but hey, Tiri came to church when he was like six years old and he signed the registry of the church as a member.  I've seen his signature.  So who knows?  Maybe, just maybe, that's enough in the eyes of God.  Which is basically shorthand for, your father is probably suffering and being tortured in agony right now.  But hey, you never know.  Maybe he's not.  And at the time, me and my sisters were pretty pissed.  But we didn't say anything.  We didn't really want to make a scene.  Mostly because I knew that my dad really would not have wanted us to.  He would have wanted to do whatever it took to make my grandmother feel better about his death.  And a Christian burial is what would make her feel better.  So we just let it go.  But seriously, preachers, don't do this shit.  I know that your whole spiel is fear-mongering, basically mental terrorism, having to scare everybody with spooky torture so they'll follow your cult.  But doing this shit at funerals is the lowest of the fucking low.  Save your lame-ass terroristic threats for the Sunday sermon where they belong.  And next up is this video that has recently gone viral that proves just how cool church actually is.  Here we go.  Come on.  Ready?  Virginity is cool.  Come on.  Come on.  Virginity is cool.  What up?  What up?  Virginity is cool.  He's got it.  He's got it.  Virginity is cool.  Come on.  Come on.  Virginity is cool.  What up?  What up?  Virginity is cool.  Come on.  Come on.  Virginity is cool.  Come on.  Come on.  You know, actually, this is pretty fucking genius.  Because if your dumb ass is at church doing this fucking shit, it will pretty much ensure you stay a virgin for a long ass time.  It's pretty much a self-fulfilling prophecy.  And the crazy part is, there's actually some pretty cute girls in this audience.  And you just know this preacher's macking on them.  He just wants you dumbasses to stay virgins so he can get in there before you do.  Preachers cock-blocking their congregation is the oldest trick in the book.  And you guys remember this dude?  This is Pastor Ernest Angley, who is the 97-year-old lead pastor at the Grace Cathedral Church in Akron, Ohio.  This is another one of those anti-gay preachers who wrote a book saying that homosexuality is basically a sin that will damn you to hell.  And guess what?  It turns out that he was actually true to his beliefs and faithful to his wife the entire time they were married.  Haha, just kidding.  Obviously he's gay as fuck.  It always happens with these fucking dudes.  The more anti-gay you are, the more you want to suck a fucking dick.  Basically this crazy old gay motherfucker was running a cult.  They said that this dude was encouraging the pregnant women in his church to have abortions.  Childless men were encouraged to have vasectomies.  And even though Ang Lee, vehemently preached against homosexuality would demand that he personally inspect the genitals of these men before and after they had their vasectomies.  in fact somebody got this hypocritical on tape admitting he was gay.  let's have a listen.  you know what she said she was going to tell.  she said i'll tell you what boker is him and naked laying in angel's bed masturbating each other and That's right!  Who cares if we're in bed together stroking each other off?  I didn't make him cum and he didn't make me cum, so it's not gay!  That's just prison rules.  I mean, seriously, how mentally ill do you have to be to join this guy's cult and let this ghoul touch you?  I mean, at some point, maybe the state needs to step in and check on these people's mental health.  Because if you're following this dude, your shit's fucked.  And next up, you guys might remember this story from earlier this month.  where this woman was in a vegetative state in a private nursing home facility and ended up giving birth.  Obviously, somebody there had raped this poor woman.  Well, anyway, they collected DNA from all the employees there, and it turns out it was this dude who raped her, Christian rapper Nathan Sutherland.  And Mr.  Sutherland has a very special message for all you kids out there. ",

            "text": "That's right, folks.  Jesus gave us all instructions, and sometimes those instructions are that you have to rape a girl who's in a vegetative state.  Don't you dare make excuses for not doing what Jesus tells you to do.  And this creepo is not looking so good, definitely seen better days.  And it's just weird to me how selectively outraged our society is.  This guy literally raped a woman who was in a vegetative state, and yet I saw absolutely nothing about it on my social media.  No outrage, no people wishing him death, nobody talking about what a sack of shit his parents were, no mobs with pitchforks forming on Twitter.  But hey, at least he didn't do something really horrible, like make a commercial or smirk at a guy.  Way to be consistent, internet.  And we're gonna finish it up with this one.  This guy is so enthusiastic about Jesus, he's even got me a little hyped about it.  Which is the word of God.  Jesus Christ.  To put on.  The armor of God.  Jesus Christ.  We love you God.  So we do it for God.  Jesus Christ.  Belt of truth.  Jesus Christ.  So we do it for we love you God.  Chestplate.  Jesus Christ.  Of righteousness.  We love you God.  Choose the helmet of salvation.  Jesus Christ.  Look, there's the enemy.  Look, there's the enemy.  So we hold up the sword of truth.  Jesus Christ.  We love you, God.  Shield of faith.  Jesus Christ!  And we fuck that holy water!  Mm, that's right, motherfuckers!  Jesus Christ!  He gon' come back from heaven and pop a cap in yo ass!  Jesus!  Gonna pop in luck for my Lord and Savior!  You sluts can't fuck with my Jesus!  Even though I think Jesus is stupid as shit, love your energy, dude.  If I ever see you out in the street, I don't give a shit.  I'm gonna pop in luck with you to Jesus.  I just pretend that you're talking about your cousin, Jesus, and you really think he's awesome.  And then you and I are going to rock that shit out.  I challenge you to a dance contest.  Loser goes to hell.  And since I'm already going anyway, I ain't got shit to lose.  And that's it for this edition, folks.  Hope you enjoyed it.
