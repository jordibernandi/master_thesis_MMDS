We saw gold and silver prices move a little bit over the summer.  Last month or two, we're back to watching paint dry a little bit.  Although fortunately, I have a guest on the show today, Phil Kennedy of Kennedy Financial, who digs into the silver world, talks to a lot of the world's experts and studies the markets himself.  He is also a CPA and financial counselor.  again, of Kennedy Financial.  And real quick, before we start with Phil, hit the subscribe button so that as these things develop, if you're wondering what's happening, how to respond, you can stay tuned with experts like Phil that I am so grateful to know and be able to communicate with.  So with that said, Phil, pleasure to have you on here today.  How is everything going with you, my friend? ",

And really, I really first got into gold and silver as a result of the 2008 financial crisis and studying just where we were prior to that and just how we've gotten to where we are now.  And despite the fact that we've had a tremendous pullback in the gold and silver market since 2011, I personally have remained bullish that entire time to the degree that I even talked about it in my free ebook, Financial Judo, why I still think folks should be taking a look at these markets and even the mining stocks.  So I kind of put together a little presentation here that may help folks understand where I'm coming from.  Really, silver, particularly right now, nobody wants it.  Hardly anybody talks about it. ",

But the reality is, I think next to Bitcoin, this may be the most ultimate contrarian investment out there.  Sure, it really no longer exists.  has the monetary attributes that once were.  uh you know silver was in our coins just like these pre-65 ben franklin's that i have here.  right right but it's not it's not going away and i've had guys like lewis on my show and he'll say things.  you know that sometimes i disagree with.  but one of the things that we hear sometimes is well silver is never going to be money again.  We'll never see a 10 to one silver to gold ratio, right?  And I always say, look, never is a very long time.  And especially with the increasing industrial uses we keep discovering for silver, it may not happen in our lifetimes.  It might not happen in the lifetimes of our children, but my plan has continued to be pass my silver along especially at these artificially suppressed prices that we see thanks to paper contracts.  so that's my personal silver thesis.

So silver, not really a great asset to trade from that perspective yet.  Again, this is just my opinion, but to me, it's like if I wanted to put something where I could leave it for my kids or grandkids, if I can think long term and I want to strip out Donald Trump's tweeting patterns and all that and have something that whenever the markets kind of reprice themselves, I mean, the silver, I think it's at the top of that list.

            "text": "I do.  In terms of behavioral finance, I'm glad you brought it up.  I wanted to talk about that.  I think this topic escapes a lot of us these days because we are living in the biggest bull market the U.S.  economy has ever experienced.  But I'll give you a reason why I think that we're already in recessions.  And I've talked about this several times, but nobody seems to be interested in the psychology of these markets and the notion that we've all been funneled into these markets as a result of qualified plans like 401ks.  I've been out to have barbecue with friends that I work with and they're more bullish than ever.  And these are older guys that lived through the 2008 financial crisis and but they think that somehow this time is different.  And those are the scariest words in finance.  So obviously they're not thinking rationally.  They've been influenced by biases from CNBC.  And I think we need to look at these markets through the lens of history.  I've showed this particular chart on my show many times, but, A lot of people think this is a Dow gold chart.  And to me, this is a human behavior chart.  This is what humans do when they experience irrational exuberance and complete despair in the markets.  For those of us that are planning ahead, we can use this to our advantage.  It makes me cringe every time I hear the president.  say or tweet, hey, look, this is the highest the stock market has ever been.  Yeah, for folks who only ever attended a government school, maybe they think that.  But for the rest of us who understand free markets and capitalism and Austrian economics, we realize that the market topped back in the summer of 2008 and is now slowly coming down.  So there we had 21 and a half ounces.  I think we're back up to 19.  We touched 17 ounces a few months ago.  But then the president managed to get Mnuchin on the line and pump the markets again.  So we're not living in unique times.  That's why we need to use contrarian investing to our advantage.  If the crowd is relaxed and happy and fully invested, that's a time for us to be scared. ",

That's why you saw so much volatility with regard to the trade deal with China.  And there's really no one left around to buy if the prices drop.  I'm not sure if this guy Rob Arnett is a gold and silver bull, but he had a great quote.  Successful contrarian investing requires us to live with discomfort for being wrong and alone.  But bargains do not exist in the absence of fear.  And for you and I and others who follow your channel, look, we've been buying assets that continue to fall in price.  It doesn't feel good, but investing is a long-term thing.  We're not trying to make a quick buck. ",

And actually, Phil, could you go back to one of the slides right before the Rob Arnott quote?  because it points out something I think a lot about where you have no one left to buy should prices drop.  Two thoughts on that.  Again, I was working on a trading for until 2012 left and have been digging into silver ever since then.  And as the years went by, I wondered, I don't know, maybe I'm missing something.  Although I think you've experienced this too, where you talk to all these different investors and, You know, you keep hearing them say the same thing.  I remember Rick Rule in one of the interviews did, he talks about how the most money he's ever made is when he found something that was undervalued.  If it goes lower, you buy more.  And I find consistently they all say the same thing, which really fits silver, where if everybody hates something, and again, it's great that you have this contrarian investing slide up, What do you think would happen if you ran a hedge fund where you just interviewed a thousand people, find out which assets.  So if everybody likes Facebook and everybody likes Tesla, you could probably even just sell that blindly, find what everybody thinks is the stupidest thing possible.  But if it's a legitimate asset, just using that to your advantage.  So any thoughts on that, Phil? ",

            "text": "Well, the problem is you can be uncomfortable for a very long time.  I mean, if I just go back to the Dow gold ratio, I mean, we're back up to where we were prior to the 2008 financial crisis.  So if you believed in the gold and silver story since at least then, and you didn't buy the market, you watched everyone and listened to everyone at cocktail parties brag about all the money they've been making.  In the US stock market.  And so it's hard from that perspective.  And I didn't personally do that.  But I have told folks, I've been out of the market since 2015, because that looked toppy to me.  And now I'm sure in hindsight, I was wrong.  But the reality is that in the very long run, we're not investing for tomorrow, Chris, you and I are investing so that we can take care of ourselves and our loved ones and retire with dignity one day.  But I do recognize that a lot of us feel the way these guys felt in the big short.  Hey, we're waiting for our payday.  You told us this was going to work.  It hasn't.  And it's taken a lot longer than any of us ever really could imagine.  I've told you this joke before.  How much, Phil, how long do you think this is going to take?  And I always say, well, you know, I think it's going to be 2016 at the latest.  And here we are now approaching the end of the decade.  And they've managed to keep it together, at least nominally.  But I want to stress, you've got to look beneath the surface.  I mean, the repos, the Dow gold ratio, things like that.  Even though Bitcoin's been so volatile, it's still up 100% year over year.  So these are things we need to look at. ",

Especially how each of those different investors, they had to go through that period, which, you know, maybe it was your wife yelling at you or your investors or your boss.  But I wonder if perhaps in terms of getting that type of success, maybe life teaches us to be patient, to really do our homework.  So when the rest of the world is laughing, you can sit there and if it goes lower, know you're getting better.  It's like if they sell a $10 bill at $8 and you buy it, and then they sell it at $5 and you buy it, most people are comfortable with that.  So I appreciate you sharing that, Phil.  And perhaps just in wrapping up, you could let folks know a little bit more about your show, some of the guests you have on.  I think it's nice to get a flavor of the way you approach things and you bring that to your show, which I love watching.  And just let folks know how they can find you. ",

            "text": "Well, yeah, so folks should know I'm not a financial advisor.  I'm a financial counselor.  So none of this is financial advice.  But where I come in handy is like we talked about earlier, right?  Behavioral finance, the psychology of money.  A lot of people struggle with that.  It's almost like a golf swing, right?  You're supposed to swing down to hit the ball up.  It's counterintuitive.  And I think it is for money too.  That's because human beings are conditioned to work together in groups.  That's how we survived for millions of years.  If you decided to be a contrarian within a group, then you were an outcast.  But I think now's the time to be a contrarian, especially looking back.  I think one day we'll say, gosh, you know, the president was tweeting about the stock market.  I mean, these, these are unusual times.  This is something that's never happened before.  And so it'll only be through the lens of history that people stop and think, gosh, you know, I was funneled into this qualified plan because the government gave me tax advantages and the market got all pumped up.  And by the way, you're going to owe taxes on that money you made one day, right?  It's not free.  So you don't, I hear this phrase a lot.  We're all in this together.  You don't have to be in this.  You can do your own thing.  You can buy sound money and really just opt out of this financial system, which is a complete wreck.  And folks can learn about that several times a week on my YouTube channel, Kennedy Financial.  We got some great guests lined up.  We talk sound money, free markets, and real economics, which I think the Arcadia economics audience would enjoy. ",
