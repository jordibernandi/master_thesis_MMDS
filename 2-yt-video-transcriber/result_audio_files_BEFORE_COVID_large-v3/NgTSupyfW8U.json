When I talk to the companies, what they would say is, well, we're not going to operate until we know whether we're going to be dinged as a security or not.  So we have this chicken and egg piece.  They move overseas and they say, well, we'll build our businesses over here.  Once the U.S.  figures it out, we'll consider coming back.  That I find concerning, and I guess I would ask, when can we expect more guidance?  We've only had two no action letters.
