I just finished his book.  I said, I told Bill last time I was with him on Wednesday, I was flying to Miami, Florida, where I was speaking at a big conservative conference, and I had a chance to read his entire book on the flight.  It's got to be a good book if you're going to read 200-plus pages on one six-hour flight.  I never put it down.  Bill, great book.  United States of Trump.  Love it. ",

I mean, Anderson Cooper didn't put him into a position where he had to explain Ukraine, China, and Hunter Biden.  He had his prepared answer.  He deflected over to Trump, which I knew Biden would do.  But I don't see any growth there in donations to him or in the polls. ",

Hillary Clinton wants to do it but doesn't want to campaign.  so it would be a draft at the convention which is very unusual could happen though I do agree with you that Elizabeth Warren as a socialist woman comes across as frightening to many middle Americans.  let me tell you a quick story Wayne.  yesterday afternoon I'm at Yankee Stadium watching the Astros beat the Yankees.  around me are 50,000 people having a great time watching the game until it was obvious the Astros were going to win.  And then some people got a little depressed.  But the atmosphere in the stadium was fun.  And this is America's pastime, baseball.  There was no racial stuff or white supremacy.  People had enough money to buy the expensive hot dogs, the seats, the beers, the Cokes.  Everybody got along.  So then after that positive experience with 50,000 people, I go home and I turn on the debate And I hear how awful America is.  It's horrible, Wayne.  It's dreadful.  All the workers are getting screwed. ",

She wants impeachment inquiry, but she doesn't want to show an actual vote by each congressperson.  Why is she doing this?  Can you have an impeachment without a vote for the inquiry showing where people stand?  I assume this is all politics and grandstanding. ",

            "text": "It's actually a shrewd move on Pelosi's part because If she calls for a vote, as they did with Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton, then she exposes some people, some Democrats, who are in districts that Donald Trump carried.  And you've got to feel that those Democrats would be in trouble.  So I talked about this with Sean Hannity on Hannity's radio show today, and I posted that on BillOReilly.com.  Hannity thinks that about 40 seats, I put it at 60, that these people, these representatives, would be in jeopardy if they publicly came out and voted for the inquiry.  Second reason is if you do that and formalize impeachment proceedings, the Trump administration then can issue subpoenas itself and can cross-examine witnesses that you bring in, that the Democrats bring in.  They don't want that.  They just want leaks.  The Democrats just want to leak to the liberal media one side of the story.  They don't want the Trump administration cross-examining.  So that's why she did it. ",

I think just based on the people I speak to everywhere I go, nobody buys that he's deserving of impeachment, nobody.  So I don't think it's working out for him at all.  Bill O'Reilly, we love having you on.  And again, I want to stress, I enjoyed your book so much.  One plane trip, and I read it from front to back.  I'd already started it, but I decided to just read it from front to back on a six-hour trip straight through.  And I've never done that before with any book.  You're the first book I've ever read all the way through.  On one half of a plane trip, meaning just on the way back to Las Vegas, I read it.  And I just thoroughly enjoyed all the insights and all the inside scoop from a guy who was there in the middle of all of it.  Thank you, Bill.  United States of Trump.  Go get a copy right now from my great friend, Bill O'Reilly.  Thanks, Bill. ",
