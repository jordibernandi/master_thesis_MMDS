So before we get to the bias, before we get to the mistreatment, what I would see as mistreatment of students for having different political worldviews, there's just a general consistency.  There's a consistent threat of him being emotionally unstable.  This comes from summer 2017.  I'm just gonna read the highlights here.  You guys can all read along.  Talking about Professor Hermes, he got emotional and almost started crying.  We expect the instructors to be professional and act in a certain way.  I would say almost 80% of the course time he was emotional, felt like he would cry.  And then everyone around him starts feeling bad and gets depressed.  I think that it's very much important for him to get some kind of counseling and therapy.  This is a concern.  This would be the most supportive.  Another one too, I'm kind of jumping around chronologically.  This was from May 1st, where Charles Hermes again was saying, last year I started my first class knowing something was seriously wrong.  then he goes on to say something was seriously wrong.  I could not focus to complete even the simplest of tasks.  I started talking about how labor in America is treated how racial issues are treated how I could not sit by anymore and pretend it wasn't happening.  at the end of the talk I raised my fist this is Charles Hermes talking raised my fist to the air and gave the loudest scream I ever gave in my life.  dot dot dot Strike!  He said.  I said strike to my students.  Then I left campus for the day.  Way to put in your hours there, Mr.  Reese.  A few hours later, my boss called asking where I was.  I told him it was International Labor Day and I was on strike.  For a moment, I thought I might have lost my job.  I'll admit the day was a moment of insanity.  It's where I snapped.  Throughout the last year, I've clung to that moment of insanity.  You don't cling to a moment of insanity.  No, you tend to run towards sanity.  You tend to cling to your one moment of sanity if you're an insane person.  And this would seem like the lamentations of an insane person.  And he says, I can think of no more fitting description for May 1st, 2017 than to say, that was the day I was reborn into a crazy person.  So he says, I was reborn, I'm crazy, and then you go back in time, and there were students saying, hey, this guy seems unstable, he seems crazy. ",

This is a constant thread, too.  This is a direct violation of the university's mission to promote free expression in an atmosphere of tolerance, responsibility, and trust.  He often uses the word fascism, but his actions are textbook definition of fascism.  Again, this is before the Crowder confronts.  And by the way, we've had a lot of emails from people.  I think we have an email up at, do we have an email at ladderwithcreditor.com?  Right now you can just send it to tips at ladderwithcreditor.com, but we will have emails specifically for professors.  We want your footage.  We want your feedback.  We want your professor reviews so that we can help kids out there because there have been a lot of students apparently suffering in silence.  And that's what's important to note.  He didn't get our show banned, but not everyone has this platform.  And my heart really breaks for kids going, hey, I think this professor's a little unstable.  You know what this might be?  This could be a kid saying, hey, this professor is failing me because I disagree with him.  And he definitely seems like he's unstable.  Can you guys look into it?

The reason that we don't typically... go the legal route is because, A, you and I both know there are bigger legal battles to fight as it relates to big tech.  We know there's, I mean, you've heard a lot of other people complain and kind of leave Patreon.  We've created Mug Club specifically to avoid that battle, right?  So we don't have a fight with Patreon.  We don't want to get into legal battles.  We want to create content.  Bill knows that.  Bill has probably done more work in creating content for the show and educating you on legal issues than actually fighting legal battles for us.  That being said, we try to keep our powder dry, so we don't sue every Tom, Dick, and Harry.  But a lot of people have been calling for some kind of action to be taken here because there are a lot of students out there who feel really helpless.  Here's one after the video.  This person said, after seeing the way a member of your hired faculty, Charles Hermes, has behaved in participating in a libel against someone, I rescind my interest in your university.  This person, by the way, has a master's and was looking at getting another postgraduate degree.  And said, I'm not going to do it at UT Arlington.  This person, again, in relation to Charles Hermes, when I read there's also a component of intimidation and mislabeling of some students he disagrees with to be abhorrent and unacceptable.  Oh, sorry, I read the second half of the phrase.  This phrase actually is not a run-on sentence.  I read half of it.  My apologies.  This person wrote it very well.  If this is true, I hope these students will capture this bias on video recording and post it to social media.  So here's something, too.  When they say, we don't want to record this because it's for the safety of our students.  Remember when we went in?  It's for the safety of our students.  Hold on a second.  We've received messages from some students who would go to that school.  And they said, please, we want more recording.  No, no, it's only to protect the people who want to operate in the dark.  There are a lot of students who want transparency, namely the students who are being failed, the students who are being discriminated against because of their views by a professor.  This idea that all students feel unsafe if somehow this conversation is being recorded, it's not true.  And this is someone, the same person wrote, there seem to be more students and professors that are on our campuses for the wrong reasons.  Some of these institutions are seeing lower enrollment rates due to concerns of parents.  This person is not, I don't believe this person is a student.  We have had to redact the information there.  I think this is actually someone who works, if I'm not mistaken, we don't have all of it, so don't, I'm not lying if I misspeak here.  I believe this is someone who might work in some sector of education here, saying we're noticeably seeing a decrease in enrollment because of this. ",

Again, our best guess would be that if there's a set of documents that they are actively trying to keep withheld, those probably have worse information than we already have.  But we'll have to wait to see that.  The Texas Attorney General's office, this division, gets inundated with these requests.  They cover the entire state, so it is a process.  But as soon as we get the rest of those... Everyone will be the first to know. ",

Some of you might be watching this on YouTube or some of you might have illegally downloaded this.  We just ask that you don't.  We don't really do a whole lot with that.  What's the one kids use now?  Is it LimeWire?  The kids use that.  I don't know.  They still use it in Napster.  Is Justin Timberlake still running the file sharing program?  I think so.  But... That's why we're able to have Half Asian Lawyer, Bill Richman, and Retainer.  Our standard is we want to focus on content.  A lot of people make their content nothing but legal battles.  Like, I'm suing this person.  Look, this is censorship.  Join me and support me on Patreon.  The truth is the bulk of our content is simply content for entertainment.  And our standard is if there is something that will impede our ability to create content, on a long-term basis.  For example, we get copyright claims because we're doing a parody, and we say, well, you know what?  This video is demonetized, but it's not necessarily worth our fight.  But if something is actually going to impede us from creating content, those are the battles that we pick.  I don't know that Charles Hermes prevents us from creating content in the future.  I know we've been banned from some schools in the past based on lies.  But I do know that it harms a lot of viewers out there and a lot of students.  And not even students, a lot of people, let's say, who are in business.  who are being censored because they don't have this platform.  And that's how we pick our battles.  That's why it's so important to hear from you because we want to know which battles you think are worth it because we don't want to fight battles that take us away from content.  Is there anything else here that I missed? ",

And, of course, this year I believe we're going to be doing one show at a school this semester.  Our new rule going forward is... We're going to do the Halloween Spooktacular as a live show and possibly a St.  Patrick's Day McStravaganza on campus.  Because bringing our show out, you've come out with it.  It's so much work.  I would love to do Notre Dame, but I don't know if they would let us do it there.  We can make that happen.  It's a lot of work.  It requires bringing out not only our whole crew, but getting day raiders, getting the equipment in, getting set up several days before.  Oh, yeah.  But that is something that we're looking to do.  So, of course, obviously, the culture on college campus is important to us.  And it's not only important to us to do our shows, but it's really important to me to see that people who watch the show, a lot of your college students, that you're able to speak freely, that you're able to not live in fear.  No one should live in fear.  Whether it's a trans person wanting to take a dump in the other bathroom, listen, it doesn't mean that they have the right to drop a deuce anywhere they want, but that person shouldn't live in fear of being attacked.  Just as if you're a conservative, you shouldn't live in fear of being failed or being kicked out of a campus simply for holding views that, by the way, half the country hold.  Hey there, here I am drinking from my mug in a button-down.  How often do you see this?  never.  so do me a favor and yourself click one of these videos playing one of these boxes here or subscribe hit the notification bell also because subscriptions don't really mean a whole lot.  if you really want to support the show join my club.  if you don't then there's no helping you.
