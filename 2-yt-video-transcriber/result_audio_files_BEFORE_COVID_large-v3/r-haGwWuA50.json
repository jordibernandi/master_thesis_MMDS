I mean, I've always wanted to do one of those wrecked thumbnails, right, where just somebody that I disagree with gets absolutely put in their place by a sea of facts and math.  And finally, it happened.  Anti-Yang, Anna Kasparian on The Young Turks.  has been campaigning for Bernie Sanders against Andrew Yang for a really long time.  And then finally, actually, with pure positivity, nothing but math and facts, a bunch of gamers actually rebutted the dismissive ideas of the freedom dividend.  It was just beautiful.  It was absolutely beautiful.  We're going to talk about it today.  Almost as kind of cool as all the Georgetown kids that came out to see Andrew Yang.  and just packed the basketball court that he was going to be in.  I mean, what a beautiful day.

The reason I wanted to highlight this, though, is I'm going to play this clip for 30, 40 seconds, and you'll hear a couple things.  you hear a lot of the times that people that are more... I don't want to say read up on, people who are just kind of more familiar with what Andrew Yang is actually proposing would say, okay, this isn't 100% true.

We had, like, in one night, two people that are verified professional video game players responding on behalf of Phantom Gang individually.  in this particular way.  I thought it was interesting and one night I saw it.  But like I said, people that aren't necessarily overtly political just saying like, this is getting really annoying.  Now, I wanted to show that first.  Show kind of how the Yang Gang does it on the internet.  But the Yang gang takes to the streets as well, man.  This is really interesting.  Now, a lot of you guys have probably seen Andrew Yang's been posting a lot of videos on social media of him playing basketball at gyms.  I remember he was in Houston warming up for the debate.  He's like, this is my debate prep, and it showed him playing basketball in a gym.  Well, people are starting to catch on.  He was in the area, and a bunch of kids in Georgetown found out that's where he's going to be.  So it started off, I guess, with a pretty small crowd. ",

He's in the gym.  I actually don't know.  If you guys know, let us know in the comments.  But... Here are some pictures they posted, right?  Which is, you know, it's a cute thing.  But here we go.  This is what I thought was interesting.  This is going on for hours.  And, you know, at first, some kids are just kind of gathering around, taking pictures.  And it keeps going on, keeps going on, keeps going on to the point where there's a line of kids that actually starts to form a little loop around the entire gym.  Now, look at that.  Hold on.  Full disclosure.  This isn't quite the same as Elizabeth Warren taking four hours of selfies, I guess.  The media love that one.  I haven't heard him talk about this.  But... This wasn't a rally.  Yang was playing basketball in a gym just to kind of get a workout in, and he gets mobbed by kids.  And here's the big thing I want to pull up from this.  We always talk about the polls.  What do they mean?  Stuff like this, right?  Polls, polls, polls.  These people, generally speaking, they don't show up in polls.  They aren't represented in the polls we see.  Yeah.  The people on Twitter right now that are saying, I'm sick and tired of you guys saying these things that just aren't true.  You just didn't read.  You didn't look.  Or if you did, you weren't paying attention. ",

Now, it's not reflected in polls, but at a certain point, it's like he goes to a college to play basketball and he gets surrounded by kids.  Someone links an article who has said bad things about Yang in the past and they get called out and it becomes a big thing on Twitter.  Until they get called out by someone who...

This is why I think you can't trust the polls because polls are almost always high propensity or not.  high propensity voters but also consistent voters or registered voters or whatever.  Look at all of those young people.  Yeah, they generally skew older and they skew more politically active.  OK, dude, half those kids is probably the first time they're voting.  I mean, the freshman at Georgetown, I got a cousin who's probably in that line who's a freshman at Georgetown.  And the first time he voted very poorly for Katie Hill.

So when a poll comes out and says, oh, Yang's only hanging out at 3%, I'm sorry, the person that's two or three percentage points above him isn't going to be filling out a gym like that.  And he's also not only, I'd say probably 70% of those people heard that Andrew Yang was going to be there like, okay, cool, I'm going to go.  But think of all the tagalongs now that have just become Yang people.  You know, every time those drones dropped a Hellfire missile on the wrong target in Afghanistan, or every time they kill one terrorist, they create like five, right?  That's a negative impact of drone striking.  A positive impact of these kind of happy accidents, happy political accidents, if you want to put it into Bob Ross nomenclature, okay?  Some of the fringe benefits of Andrew Yang doing this is think of how many Yang gangers he just created in that line.  They were just friends that came along to see what he was up to.  And realized, holy crap, this guy's cool.  He's a presidential candidate.  And they're going to go home.  They're going to read about him.  They're going to fall in love with the Yang gang.

I don't see it.  I mean, I saw a lot of people in the media basically bringing the death bell for Kamala Harris, so it's... Andrew Yang, definitely, I think we're going to see double digits will be a big move for him.  And I think he's closer to double digits than we're seeing.  It just takes more time to show up in the polls because we're seeing people come out online and they come out in person.  So eventually they're going to come out in the polls.
