And it has been an interesting journey.  I think we've only wanted to kill each other probably once.  And that was maybe today.  But outside of that.  We've been doing really good.  We have figured out how to cook meals in a moving vehicle, which has been, you know, it's an art form, I'm going to say, that Lauren and I have pretty much mastered at this point.  Mario's did a lot of the driving.  I drove a little bit yesterday, and I'm going to publicly apologize for all of the mean things I said about your swerving and siren.  It is not easy.  It is not easy driving that thing.  And to drive through some of these barren lands... For the amount of time you've driven, you've driven a bit, so high five.  Okay, all right.

Look at the reviews.  If you go to a Pilot or a Flying J's and they have one of those Megalathon showers, it's like a spa.  Swear.  I never would have thought it, you know, like.  I'm a little extra, so I like a good shower, you know, in a nice spot.  But I had no idea that these truck stops had these showers.  So shout out to Olivia and Yosef.  They travel and they do trucking as a business and put us on to the trucking app and woo, it's been great.  They even have washing machines.  So I'll probably do a video about how to wash at a truck stop just so you can see that it is an actual thing and it's pretty cool. ",
