            "text": "The bogus charges were quickly dropped with the state attorney's office issuing this statement regarding the arrest.  Out of curiosity, I submitted a public records request for a copy of Long's personnel file.  and a review of Long's disciplinary records reveal a troubling history including sustained complaints for insubordination, failure to perform duties, lying to investigators about misconduct, destroying evidence of misconduct, and watching pornography on his agency-issued computer while in his office at the St.  Johnson County Sheriff's Department.  According to Long, on June 11, 2008, at approximately 1100 hours, he was in his office utilizing his sheriff's office laptop computer to view an internet site he stated he should not have been on.  Long described the site as showing adult women in various stages of undress and in various stages of sexual intercourse.  Long further stated, I knew it was wrong.  I knew I shouldn't have been doing it.  While he was viewing one of the images, Long stated Becky Henson walked into his office.  During the interview, Long reviewed the images from the disc provided by Bolas, containing approximately 120 pictures of adult pornography which were recovered from his agency laptop computer.  Long confirmed that they were images he had viewed from the internet websites and the deleted after viewing.  In a recommendation for discipline memorandum, Christopher Strickland, who was Lawing's supervisor at the time, stated the following.  In light of the behavior of Sergeant Lawing being below conduct standard, below moral standard, below ethical standard, and below supervisory standard, I must dismiss anything but objective reasoning and state the following.  Sergeant J.F.  Lawing, by his intentional conduct, has shrunk from his duties as a supervisor and he has committed a wrong that cannot be ignored or minimized, for he has violated the trust of his office, his subordinates, and his supervisor.  In addition, he has shown a tendency to be delinquent in his autonomy and must be supervised constantly to deter temptation to inappropriate behavior in the workplace.  Therefore, it is my recommendation that Sergeant J. F. Long be relieved of his rank of sergeant and his duties in the field investigative unit.  J. Long has since been promoted to lieutenant, and is the manager of the Internal Affairs Unit for the St.  Johns County Sheriff's Office, where he is responsible for investigating all serious complaints filed against an employee or related to actions taken by the agency.
