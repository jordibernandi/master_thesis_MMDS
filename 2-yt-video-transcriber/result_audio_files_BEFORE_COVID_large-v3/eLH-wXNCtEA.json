            "text": "There's a conflict of interest for any politician who takes the money of a hedge fund in that they may be swayed, the politician, by the financial interest.  Now this has arisen again over Boris Johnson because as Byline Times detected, the sponsors, the backers to his leadership campaign, were dominated by hedge funds and city traders.  In fact, we calculated of those 40 donors declared by the Electoral Commission, 30 out of 40 were hedge fund owners and city traders.  They provided 65% of the money which Johnson got for his campaign.  To what extent is he swayed by their interests?  The day before Boris wins the leadership, Chris Binody was interviewed.  He says they should suspend Parliament like it was going to happen, like he knew about it. ",

            "text": "Former Chancellor Hammond said the same thing.  Is there a ruthless side of him?  Is it financially interested?  That's the danger, that he could be motivated by the potential rewards by being in this entourage.  Maybe he feels very poor compared to this entourage are multimillionaires.  This is a man who thinks \u00a3250,000 for a column a month is nothing.  You've got \u00a380,000 for one speech to a hedge fund.  Always a problem when politics mixes too much with very wealthy men.  Crispin Odey, who's quite famously said that he'd made personally \u00a3200 million the night of the Brexit referendum, he said, The morning has gold in its mouth.  and looked very luxurious and very happy with himself, or who wouldn't be?  He had contributed 800,000, 870,000 to the Leave campaigns.  And actually just before Brexit, it was through his firm that Somerset Capital Management, Rees-Mogg's firm, was incubated by Chris Binody.  Chris Binody actually donated to Jacob Rees-Mogg's parliamentary campaign.  O'Day is Rupert Murdoch's ex-son-in-law.  Jacob Rees-Mogg is the son of Rupert Murdoch's ex-editor, William Rees-Mogg, who used to edit The Times, who has written a book about disaster capitalism, actually, about how the only way to make money is through disaster in the later phases of civilization.  So you have a very tight nexus of well-connected... wealthy individuals.  I'm told there are other hedge funds more closely embedded with Johnson and his entourage.  This is a matter of public concern.  No minister should have a conflict of interest or an appearance of conflict of interest.  And we've got, at very least, the appearance of a conflict of interest.  In a turbulent world, there is always money to be made in turbulence.  Since 2008, money has had very little place to go.  One of the things you can look at and make money if you get it right are sudden shock events.  Brexit has been one of those.  Trump has been one of those.  In that situation, hedge funds can, if they get it right, make a lot of money.  What if those hedge funders are participating on something they're speculating on?  Paul Marshall invested very heavily in vote leave and big support of Michael Gove.  Was Marshall... who persuaded Go in February 2016 to back the Leave campaign.  So here's a major hedge fund owner and he had the key voice with, apart from Boris Johnson, the other major leader of the Vote Leave campaign.  Those two figures have such financial interests around them that appear to have swayed them both in 2016 with Go's decision to join the Vote Leave campaign to Cameron Shaw and now 2019 with Bontemps trying to suspend parliament and try all these tricks.  It does suggest, doesn't it, to any rational person that money is speaking too heavily in our democracy and some very rich people have much more sway than you or I. A lot of people just don't know these stories.  Information is not any power, it's the lifeblood of democracy.  Journalism and media is a key battleground, so I would recommend you support Double Down on Patreon.  They don't take any adverts, they don't have any outside money, it's just you.
