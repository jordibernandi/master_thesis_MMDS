However, despite his few ties to the Malayan royal family, he was selected to become the next king of Malay in either 1307 or 1312, which of the two years he became king is unknown.  So he had no ties, as I previously stated.  because of this, why he was selected to become king is pretty much a mystery.  However, the Arab scholar Al-Alumai, I forget how his name is pronounced, it might not even be out there, said that the reason for this was the then emperor of Malai decided to go on a trip to the Atlantic Ocean, and so gave Mansa Musa regent power for the time, and Regardless, Mansa Musa made $400 billion in his lifetime.
