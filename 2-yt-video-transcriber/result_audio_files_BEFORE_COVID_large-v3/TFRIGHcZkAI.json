I'm running for president to be the Democratic nominee that rebuilds our Democratic Party, takes it out of their hands, and truly puts it in the hands of the people of this country, a party that actually hears the voices of Americans who are struggling all across this country and puts it in the hands of veterans and fellow Americans who are calling for an end to this ongoing Bush-Clinton-Trump foreign policy doctrine of regime change wars, overthrowing dictators in other countries, needlessly sending my brothers and sisters in uniform into harm's way to fight in wars that actually undermine our national security, and have cost us thousands of American lives.

WHAT SENATOR HARRIS IS DOING IS UNFORTUNATELY CONTINUING TO TRAFFIC IN LIES AND SMEARS AND INUENDOS BECAUSE She cannot challenge the substance of the argument that I'm making, the leadership and the change that I'm seeking to bring in our foreign policy, which only makes me guess that she will, as president, continue the status quo, continue the Bush-Clinton-Trump foreign policy of regime change wars, which is\u2014 Deeply destructive.  This is personal to me because I served in Iraq.  I left my seat in the state legislature in Hawaii, volunteered to deploy to Iraq where I served in a medical unit where every single day I saw the terribly high human cost of war.  I take very seriously the responsibility that the president has to serve as commander in chief.  to lead our armed forces and to make sure always, no, I'm not gonna put party interests first.  We have Democrats, Republicans, Libertarians and Independents coming together saying, hey, we are all concerned about making sure that we have clean water to drink for our families, that we have clean air, to breathe, that we're able to raise our kids in a community that's safe.  It is the hyper-partisanship in Washington, unfortunately, that has created this gridlock that has stood in the way of the kinds of progress that I would bring about as president.  It's important that we set the record straight and correct the racial injustices that exist in a very institutional way in our country, beginning with things that have to do with our criminal justice system.  where predominantly the failed war on drugs that has been continuing to be waged in this country has disproportionately impacted people of color and people in poverty.  This is something that I'll do as president and commander in chief, is to overhaul our criminal justice system, working in a bipartisan way to do things like end the failed war on drugs.  But I want to get back to Pete Buttigieg and his comment about experience.  Pete, you'll agree that the service that we both have provided to our country as veterans by itself does not qualify us to serve as commander-in-chief.  I think the most recent example of your inexperience in national security and foreign policy came from your recent careless statement about how you as president would be willing to send our troops to Mexico to fight the cartels.  As commander-in-chief, leader of our armed forces, I bring extensive experience, serving for seven years in Congress, on the Foreign Affairs Committee, on the Armed Services Committee, on the Homeland Security Committee, meeting with leaders of countries around the world, working with military commanders of different commands, dealing with high-level national security briefings, understanding what's necessary, the that I've gotten to walk in on day one to serve as Commander-in-Chief.  Congresswoman, thank you.  Mr.  Mayor, I'll allow you to respond. ",

The fact-checkers can check this out.  But your point about judgment is absolutely correct.  Our commander-in-chief does need to have good judgment.  And what you've just pointed out is that you would lack the courage to meet with both adversaries and friends to ensure the peace and national security of our nation.  I take the example of those leaders who have come before us, leaders like JFK, who met with Khrushchev, like Roosevelt, who met with Stalin, like Reagan, who met with Trump.  Like Reagan, who met and worked with Gorbachev, these issues of national security are incredibly important.  I will meet with and do what is necessary to make sure that no more of our brothers and sisters in uniform are needlessly sent into harm's way fighting regime change wars that undermine our national security.  I'll bring real leadership and experience to the White House.  My personal commitment to you, to all of my fellow Americans, is to treat you with respect and compassion, something that we in Hawaii call aloha.  Every single person deserves to be treated with respect, regardless of race, religion, or gender, or even your politics.  Inclusion, unity, respect, aloha, these will be the operating principles for my administration.  Dr.  Martin Luther King visited Hawaii first back in 1959 where he expressed his appreciation for what we call the Aloha spirit.  He said, we look to you for inspiration as a bold example for what you have already succeeded in the areas of racial harmony and racial justice where we are still struggling to achieve in other sections of the country.  He later went on to say, as I looked out at the various faces in various colors mingled together like the waters of the sea, I see only one face, the face of the future.  Working side by side, let's defeat the divisiveness of Donald Trump.  Come together and usher in a 21st century of racial harmony, of racial justice, peace, inclusion, and true equality.  Working side by side, let's make Dr.  King's dream our reality. ",
