But I can't understand anything of what she just said because none of it makes any sense.  For example, she uses the words proximal and distant.  And she refers to proximal as near and distal as far.  But this is the definition I can find.  Proximal refers to something closer to the torso, while distal refers to parts and places away from the torso.  So, for example, a finger is distal to the wrist, which is distal to the elbow, which is distal to the shoulder.  So... Is it just me misunderstanding the context she's using it in?  Because I can't interpret it any other way.  The only definitions I can find refer to anatomy, which has got absolutely nothing to do with space and time, which is what I think she's talking about.  Maybe. ",

I'm fairly sure as well.  All her videos are like this.  She just jumbles together loads and loads of big words.  So she's obviously quite an articulate woman.  And I can't decide.

But this instrument, a LIGO detector, is used to measure gravity waves.  Think about it like this, because this is the way I'm interpreting your logic.  You can't see oxygen, but we know it's there, we accept it's there, even though it's something we can't physically see.  Because without it, we would all just stop breathing and die.  And you're happy to accept that oxygen exists.  But you're not happy to accept that gravity exists because you can't see the gravity waves?  More perfect, flat-out logic.  And there we have it, Orphan Red.  Now there must be a couple of things that stood out to you from this video.  Yeah, her logic and her reasoning.  What else did you think I meant you pervs?  Thank you everyone for making it to the end of another video.  Oh dear me.  Right, this week I'm going to get the thanking of my Patreons correct because some of the names were cut off last week and I honestly didn't mean for that to happen.  so I'm going to make every effort to make sure that all my Patreons are named appropriately.  and if you want to support me on patreon then the link is in the description.  as always it's massively appreciated.  and if you don't fine just give the video a thumbs up.  and if you're new subscribe And I will see you all next week.  Before you go, there is one more thing.  We will have all seen, or hopefully will have all seen, that YouTube and Google are starting to basically censor conspiracy contents or Flat Earth videos, 9-11 conspiracies, which is all well and good because nobody wants the Flat Earth bullshit online anyway.  But... what it means for other creators like myself that use flat earth as a tag conspiracy theories as a tag that it's going to mean that possibly our videos don't show up in search results either.  and i know it's a big ask but i truly truly do appreciate any help any of my subscribers give me.  If myself and all the other anti-Flat Earth channels, Fight the Flat Earth, Conspiracy Cat, Simon, Dan, Plan a Walk, McToon, Godless Engineer, the list goes on.  If you could try and get in the habit of sharing our videos for us, it's going to be a massive, massive help for our type of content going forward.  Because if we do get tangled up in the net that Google are now throwing out, It just means our channels aren't gonna grow anymore.  a lot of the Flat Earth channels have already got massive following so It's not going to be as much of an issue for them, but some of the smaller channels like like mine I rely on being shown in the suggested search results and Google are putting a stop to it, which is sad.  So, again, I know it's a big ask, but if you can share the videos for us all, it would be hugely appreciated. ",
