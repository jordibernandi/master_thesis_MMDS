I think Anthony would say that someone saying a belief is true to them is something that's worth examining.  And I think that's something I would say, too.  I would say it's at least worth examining.  I wouldn't necessarily say that a belief can't be just true to somebody because that couldn't be the case.  And I haven't discovered that yet.  I will say that depending on the belief.  Um, you know, beliefs motivate our reasoning in some sort of ways.  And so when, when people say as belief is true to me, there's certain circumstances that cause them to have this belief.  And this belief kind of motivates their thinking in some other ways.  And typically this isn't a fact about reality.  When people say this is true to me, we're not talking about whether or not the earth is flat.  We're talking about reality.  how to love somebody or whether or not there's a God or something that's actually personal to them and not necessarily a fact about the universe.  I think that's what most people mean when they say this belief is true to me.  It's worked out for me in some sort of circumstances, right?  You know, I... What's a... Maybe a casual superstition like, oh, I have this lucky rabbit's foot and it makes me feel lucky and I don't know whether or not it actually gives me luck.  But it's true to me that it gives me luck.  That's kind of an example of what I'd say.  And what people don't maybe necessarily realize is when they say that they \u2013 They're making a claim about reality most of the time, whether they realize it or not.  If they say that this rabbit's foot is actually giving me good luck, that might be something we could measure.  Maybe not.  But it's something that has an effect on reality regardless.  And so I think that's what Anthony would say to that.  If it has an effect on reality, can we explore this?  Is this something that we can confirm to be true or not true?  And I would probably tend to agree with that.  I would say, yeah, this is definitely something that's worth at least examining because I want to know if I can just take a rabbit's foot and just carry it around with me and give it good luck.  I think that would be cool. ",

We can definitely see that there are properties to this thing.  And we can definitely see that.  Look, if Jen, if you come around this table, you'll see that six is a nine from my perspective.  So I can demonstrate a method by which you can come to the same conclusions that I would when it comes to talking about religious beliefs, however.  And somebody saying, oh, well, you just have to have the same experiences that I did.  It doesn't translate as well, right?  I can't feel the Holy Spirit in my heart like other people can.  It was, for what I interpret from my experiences, was something I was experiencing internally that I later labeled as the Holy Spirit.  Because that was the cultural frame of reference that was given to me.  But look, I can actually look at this experience through the lens of psychology and through the lens of science in general.  And I can find that other people also experience this thing that one might call the Holy Spirit that aren't even related to Christianity at all, that have no contact with Christian culture.  But we see common ties there through biology, right?  And so that's kind of my response.  I think it just comes to the method of how you got to that worldview because even the six and the nine guys, they have a method where they came to it.  They came to it at certain sides of the number, right? ",
