You may or may not know that he also created the plot embryo, Hallowed Be the Universal Pattern, linked in our descriptions and our hearts, which is the story creation tool that he and his writers use to craft every single episode.  If you just watch my videos every once in a while and you haven't been to my website or you don't really know me off of YouTube, you might not know that making videos about the plot embryo for fun isn't all I do.  Teaching the plot embryo and helping writers get amazing results with it is actually my full-time day job.  The plot embryo is a crazy powerful storytelling tool but it can be a little tricky to get the hang of in the beginning.  so let's break down an episode of Rick and Morty so you can see how the plot embryo works in action.  and because I want those sweet sweet clicks we're gonna do the episode where Rick gets himself into a little bit of a pickle.  And spoiler warning, I'm about to spoil the shit out of this entire episode because that's the whole point of this video.  So consider yourself warned, dumdums. ",

At plot point one, we have the backstory that Rick and Beth are both dysfunctional, closed off, and resistant to change.

            "text": "Let's talk about Rick's arc in Pickle Rick.  So Dan Harmon uses this one eight-part structure for all of his stories and episodes, whereas I personally use both the eight-part structure, which I call the heroic plot embryo because it tends to get a happy or satisfying ending, and I also use a six-part version called the tragic plot embryo because not all stories get that triumphant ending.  Rick's plot embryo is heroic in structure.  He succeeds at what he sets out to do, but he's definitely not a traditional hero.  Pickle Rick is a great example of an anti-hero's heroic plot embryo.  He essentially brings all of the conflict on himself and his apology at the end is really just a tiny concession.  It seems for the most part he hasn't taken Dr Wong's analysis very seriously.  He certainly hasn't undergone a huge transformation.  But at the beginning of the episode he absolutely refused to be honest and he would never have apologised for that.  So it still hits our plot point eight.  And that is how Pickle Rick's plot embryo works.  Now, of course, I don't have access to the original plot embryo used to create this episode.  So consider this my best interpretation, kind of reverse engineered from the finished episode.  Tell me in the comments what episode you would like to see me break down next.  As someone who specialises in helping people with their story structure and crafting plots, I often hear writers worry that using a structure like the plot embryo will make their stories formulaic, it will tie their hands behind their back, it will stop them from being as creative and essentially result in these kind of lacklustre formulaic stories.  And I think the perfect example of why that's not true is the fact that every single episode of Rick and Morty is created using the plot embryo structure.  And I would defy anyone to watch a season of Rick and Morty and tell me that it's formulaic or derivative or predictable or uncreative.  If you're a writer struggling with crafting your stories, if you find that they never turn out how you had imagined or hoped, I created the Story Magic Academy for you.  In it, I share my complete system from generating that first seed of a story idea all the way to turning that into a complete plot embryo ready to be written.  It's where I've put all my best secrets and tips for getting the most out of the plot embryo framework and making the story creation process clear, practical, and gratifying.  So here's what to do next.  If you're watching this video pretty soon after I released it, the enrollment for the Story Magic Academy is open now for a limited time.  If you're watching this sometime in the future, the Academy might already be in session.  But don't worry, you can also follow that link and join the waiting list, and you'll be notified the next time.  enrollment is open.  Okay, I'm done hawking my wares now.  Don't forget to signal to our overlords that this content is above average, perform the token gesture, which indicates that you would like to see more videos from me, and grant me access to your sacred and coveted notification center.  Boom!  I just spat everywhere.  Enroll!  Is that in the shot?  The gingerbread man?  Terrible, yes.  But great.  It's just a headless gingerbread man.  I don't know why I tried to... which I flew.  bird or the floor goes.  orp gets himself into a pickle.  you suck and you should feel bad harsh.  he gets it.  he literally does get himself into a pickle see.
