            "text": "I have a plan for Medicare for All, and I'm proud that it's the first health care plan by anyone in this presidential primary that lays out the full cost and how to pay for it.  And here's the deal.  It doesn't raise middle class taxes by one penny.  Not one penny.  If we make no other changes over the next 10 years, Americans will reach into their pockets and pay out about $11 trillion on insurance premiums, co-pays, deductibles, and uncovered medical expenses.  My plan reduces those costs to zero, sort of like an $11 trillion tax break.  So we have two choices.  We can maintain the status quo that leaves 24 million uninsured, leaves 63 million with substandard care, and forces Americans to ration medicine and turn to GoFundMes.  Or we can spend slightly less on Medicare for All, which covers everyone, ensures long-term care for our seniors, and puts $11 trillion back in the pockets of the people by eliminating premiums, copays, and deductibles.  Now, you might be asking, how can we possibly provide better coverage to more people for less money?  Well, It's a two-part answer.  Under Medicare for All, we rein in the corruption, the waste, the inefficiency, and the corporate profiteering.  That's money we can save and money we can spend on actual care.  So we pay less overall for health care to get more real health care coverage.  The second part of the answer is to change the structure of who pays for health care in America and how.  We're going to take the $11 trillion projected out-of-pocket health care costs over the next 10 years and make that number zero.  No more premiums, co-pays, or deductibles.  No more out-of-network bills.  For middle-class families, that means thousands of dollars back in your pocket every year.  Under my plan, existing federal and state spending on health care stays the same.  For middle class families, there'll be no new taxes.  Look, you're already paying into Medicare and Medicaid, so you're done.  No new taxes, no new costs.  Business spending on health care also stays about the same.  Payments just go to Medicare instead of to private insurers.  That's about $9 trillion in the next 10 years.  And we make up the rest largely with taxes on big corporations and the top 1%.  So yeah, for the top 1%, they're going to have to pay their fair share.  And corporations are finally going to have to pay the taxes they're meant to pay, just like everyone else.  That's it.  That's Medicare for all.  It covers everyone.  It's fully paid for.  And independent economists have verified it's doable.  All it takes is the courage to fight for it.  Insurance companies and drug companies will spend tens of millions of dollars in political contributions and disinformation campaigns to try to keep tens of billions of dollars in profits flowing into themselves.  That's corruption, plain and simple.  We have to call it out and we have to fight back against it.  Because like any big idea, you don't get what you don't fight for.  We need a health care system that recognizes that health care is a human right.  And I will fight to get it done. ",
