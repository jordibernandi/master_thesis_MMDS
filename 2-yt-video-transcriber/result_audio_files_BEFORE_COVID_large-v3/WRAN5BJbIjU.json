I gotta go back in surgery.  What's up, Miko?  How are you?  Everybody said something about Sis Miko.  I'm back in the hospital.  I gotta get surgery again on my foot.  They wanted more surgery on my foot because it was messed up.  So they admitted me to the hospital.  So I gotta get surgery again.  Yeah, the foot didn't heal correctly.  You know, I was in the emergency room the other day and then I had to go to my doctor today and they were like, look, you just gotta get emergency surgery.  Yeah.  So I'm here at the hospital again.  I'm in a damn little bitty baby gown with a nigga ass all out.  Yeah.  So yeah, the shit wasn't, it wasn't healing correctly.  It's just real raggedy shit.  So I got all this bullshit.  So I'm sitting up in this bitch like I just had a fucking abortion.  So.  You know, so, you know, hopefully they'll just get everything straight because, yeah, my foot was not healing at all.  It was real, real janky.  Yeah, so, yeah, that gal ain't no joke.  What's up, Tiara?  How are you, sis?  Hopefully, I should be good by Sunday.  Yeah, hopefully I should be good by Sunday.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Those janky-ass antibiotics.  I really got to take those religiously so everything won't get reinfected.  They show the foot.  It's wrapped up so you can't really see nothing.  Hold on.  Yeah, the footage wrapped up.  Let me flip the camera around.  Yeah, the footage wrapped up, so y'all can't see nothing.  Yeah.  So, yeah, y'all can't really see nothing with it.  This came... They prayed for me.  Yeah, yeah, man.  Yeah, man, I don't like these hospitals, nigga.  I do not like coming to these hospitals.  I come in here and they start selling my kidney and shit.  I don't want my damn gallbladder to be sold on the black market.  So how many of you guys got down with the Indiegogo?  We still got the Indiegogo going for the Foundation of Black American Conference.  That's going good.  We still got a little momentum going.  We got like 12, 13 days left.  So y'all need to go to Indiegogo.  And get down with that.  Your penis is going to be up here in a minute.  She's on the way up.  Because this was like last minute.  I went to the doctor and they were like, yeah, we're going to have to have surgery tonight.  They were like, damn.  They were like, yeah.  They started calling the hospital like, yeah, you need to go right now.  So I had to throw some shit in the duffel bag and come on through.  Shout out to 90's Baby.  That's what's up.  Yeah, so they were like, yeah, you need to come on in right now.  You bought a ticket and donate.  That's what's up, man.  Everybody go ahead and get your advance admissions to the Foundation of Black American Conference on the Indiegogo page.  We got 12 days left, so yeah.  And shout out to the people at the Turkey Hut down there in Houston.  I hate what they're going through.  They're trying to run.  It's a successful black business out there in Houston, and they're doing what they do.  They're trying to run them out.  We tried to hit them with all these different ordinances and lawsuits.  I really, really hate when we start doing things successfully.  We get attacked from all sides.  You know, we got to start looking out for each other like that.  No doubt, guys.  So, yeah, I'm good.  Just letting folks know what's popping.  I'm good.  People have been asking about the surgery and all that stuff.  So I'm about to go to surgery any minute now.  So I'm about to be out.  They're about to drug me the hell up and knock me out.  So I will keep you guys posted and y'all be good. ",
