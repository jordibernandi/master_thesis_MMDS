If you take all the well-known educators of the 19th and 20th century, Piaget and John Dewey and all them, they did not have as much insight into the child as he did.  And in addition to which, he loved the children.  At the same time, he actually gave his life, literally, to comfort children.  He could have left the ghetto.  He didn't have to even go into the ghetto.  He was a well-known individual.  There were friends, Polish friends, who were going to save him with no difficulty at all.  But he felt as a father, as the protector, he must be there with them.  And so he willingly went into the cattle car at the Warsaw Ghetto with the children.  193 children into the cattle car to comfort them.  Boy, it's dark.  They don't know where they're going.  He's with them. ",
