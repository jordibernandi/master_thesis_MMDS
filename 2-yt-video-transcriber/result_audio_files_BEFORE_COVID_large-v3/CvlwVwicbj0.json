With me today, we have Senior Investigator Bill Marshall, who's here with us to talk about the Obama White House's hand in tracking a FOIA request involving Hillary Clinton's email scandal.  Do you want to take us into this topic a little bit, Bill?  Sure. ",

            "text": "Bruce, thanks for having me back.  We recently got a production of records out of the State Department, communications out of the State Department, as a result of litigation that we've been involved in for five years over the Benghazi talking points.  You may recall after the Benghazi disaster, the White House issued talking points which were modified to not reflect badly on the Obama administration.  They tried to cover up essentially these true circumstances behind the Benghazi attack in 2012.  As a result of that litigation, the court ordered discovery.  That is, the court found that the State Department and Justice Departments acted in bad faith in responding to our records requests in connection with the Benghazi talking points email.  So as part of that discovery, the State Department was compelled to release 44 pages of records involving a FOIA request that had actually been submitted by another nonprofit organization in Washington, a liberal one called CRU.  This is Citizens for Responsible Ethics in Washington, I think is what it stands for.  And it's very interesting because Crewe had sent a FOIA request to the State Department asking about any email accounts associated with Hillary Clinton.  And I'm paraphrasing slightly, but that's what it amounted to.  FOIA requests set off alarm bells in the White House and the State Department because suddenly they realized that they got a problem because they know at that point in 2012 that Hillary Clinton is operating an illegal email server, that she's trafficking Highly classified information over an illegal server.  You have to remember, all of her colleagues were communicating, her top colleagues, Jake Sullivan and Huma Abedin, Cheryl Mills, they were all communicating with Hillary on this email account that they knew was a personal email account on an illegal server.  So the White House is very alarmed.  And they contact, now the crew had sent this request asking for records about any email accounts associated with Hillary Clinton.  They had sent this request again in December of 2012.  The White House contacts the State Department and says, we want to know what's going on.  How are you responding to this Freedom of Information Act request?  So there's some very interesting dialogue back and forth among the State Department officials and how they're going to respond to this.  Now they make a point of saying, one of the records officers makes a point of saying, we're not including personal email accounts in responding to this request.  We are only looking at official email accounts.  And of course Hillary did not have, ostensibly did not have, an official State Department email account.  So the State Department responded to the crew request in May 2013 saying, we have no responsive records.  This is a bald-faced lie in my humble opinion as a FOIA investigator.  They knew they had, they knew that there were responsive records.  Any government records that are transmitted via a personal email account are still government records.  The fact that they were sent, if they're discussing government business, the fact that they were sent on a personal email account doesn't make them any less of an official government record.  It just makes them maybe not necessarily in the custody and control of the federal government.  But the federal government is still responsible for preserving those records and archiving them and making them available to FOIA requesters or Congress if Congress decides subpoenas and that sort of thing.  So the only reason that this information came to light was because we have filed, again, we had filed a FOIA request in 2014 for records, for State Department records, including Hillary Clinton's communications about the Benghazi attack, a Talking Points memo that was prepared to sort of cover up the Obama administration's culpability in the Benghazi attack of 2012.  They gave us the same answer that they gave Crewe.  They could find no responsive records in terms of Hillary Clinton producing, generating emails discussing the Benghazi attack.  But because our lawyer, Ramona Katka, great lawyer, pushed that litigation, she didn't settle for that answer that they could find no responsive records.  She asked for a search affidavit from the State Department.  That's a big problem for them.  because in the search affidavit and then they have to explain exactly what steps they took, what repositories of records that they searched to find responsive records.  She also asked for what we call a Vaughn Index.  And this is essentially an index that the government has to produce upon request in litigation explaining what records they found, why they were withholding them, and this sort of thing.  And they were delaying.  The government delayed and delayed and they were kind of stalling because they didn't want to produce this Vaughn Index.  Well eventually in April 2015 they were scheduled to finally produce a long index.  So to get ahead of that what they did was they leaked to the New York Times the fact that Hillary Clinton was operating an illegal email server.  You may recall in March 2015 A seminal article was published in the New York Times of all places, which is obviously an ally of Hillary Clinton, that Hillary was operating this illegal email server.  You have to ask yourself, why would the New York Times, the mouthpiece of the Democratic Party in essence, report information like this that was damaging to Hillary Clinton.  And the reason was because our litigation the following month was going to force this out anyway.  So they tried to get ahead of the story by leaking it to the New York Times and having the Times put the best spin on it that they could.  So the idea in public relations, as you know, is always to sort of get ahead of bad news and try to put your own Put your own spin on it.  So we essentially forced revelation out of the government back in 2015 that Hillary Clinton was operating an illegal email server, and it came out in the form of a New York Times article so they could beat us to it.  So after that information was revealed, we went back to the court and we said, wait a minute, the State Department has been claiming that they did a thorough search for Hillary Clinton's emails relating to the Benghazi attack, and they claim that they didn't find any, and they're trying to dismiss the case.  Yet now we find out that she was operating an illegal email server.  Have they checked those personal emails?  Well, they hadn't, of course, right?  because they didn't want to.  So we convinced the court, Judge Royce Lamberth, that the State Department had operated in bad faith.  And back in December of 2018, Judge Lamberth issued a scathing court opinion.  If I could read from it for a second, a couple of quotes from it.  He said in his opinion, this is just remarkable, the wording that he used.  Judge Royce Lambros said, speaking of the State Department and Justice Department's handling of our, responding to our request for Hillary Clinton's emails, He said, at best, states' attempt to pass off its deficient search as legally adequate during settlement negotiations was negligence born out of incompetence.  At worst, career employees in the State and Justice Departments colluded to scuttle public scrutiny of Clinton, skirt FOIA, and hoodwink this court.  He added that the government's response to the Judicial Watch, quote, smacks of outrageous conduct.  And finally, he said that Hillary's use of a personal email server to conduct her government business was, quote, one of the gravest modern offenses to government transparency, unquote.  To see that, to see a federal judge use that kind of language.  in a ruling, in a court ruling, is astonishing. ",

I mean, it would be like, you know, if you or I, as teenagers, took Dad's car out with our friends and we crashed it, you can imagine what Dad would say when we got back home, the kind of outrage.  That's basically what Judge Lamberth is expressing in this opinion.  You know, federal court opinions are supposed to be obviously very measured and sort of dry and anodyne.  Judge Lamberth was really bringing the point home here that Hillary's conduct was outrageous and the failure of the State and Justice Departments to adequately respond to our FOIA request was either, as he says, born of utter incompetence or more likely a massive cover-up.  So he ordered back in January of this year, just a few months ago, he ordered, he acceded to our request to depose or take interrogatories, that's written sworn statements, from various high-level government officials, including people like former National Security Advisor Susan Rice, Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Jake Sullivan, who's top aide to Hillary, of course, FBI Assistant Director for Counterintelligence Bill Pristat, And those depositions, those interrogatories, and now the document discovery that's being compelled by Judge Lamberth is producing astonishing records like what we're seeing here with the revelations about how the White House was so alarmed by the FOIA request from Crewe, which might have exposed Hillary's illegal email server back in 2012.  It demonstrates how the White House knew all along, for a long period of time, that Hillary was using an illegal email server.  And of course they knew, because Hillary, we know, was communicating with Barack Obama via her illegal email account.  So this is just another example of the outrageous conduct of the of the obama administration on so many levels.  but you know of course right now we're just just addressing this one but you know as our litigation continues as we conduct more depositions um we just recently deposed justin cooper who was a top bill clinton aide who had set up you know hillary's you know blackberries that he later smashed with a hammer and you know all that kind of conduct.  uh we deposed him.  um We'll continue to take depositions from other individuals and take interrogatories, written, sworn statements, and we'll continue getting more records.

We know that he was communicating with Hillary.  She was using her private email account.  The notion that Barack Obama, who was supposedly the smartest president ever, if you believe the left, was unaware that his Secretary of State was using an illegal email account is absurd.  I mean, it's risible, really, to think that to think that the president was not fully aware of this conduct and her trafficking highly classified information on an unsecure server.  It boggles the mind.  You know, as I say, as this litigation continues and hopefully as the investigations by Attorney General Barr continue, more information will come out about Barack Obama's knowledge of Hillary's activities.

Litigation takes a long time.  It's expensive.  We have outstanding attorneys who litigate for us.  We've got great investigative staff who have a breadth of knowledge.  about government corruption and particularly corruption with respect to the last administration that is rivaled by few people in this town, apart from the investigators that are working for Attorney General Barr.  So I'm confident that we'll continue to produce records, we'll continue to get information out of these witnesses that we're deposing.  And I think they're sweating bullets.  Honestly, I think that all these officials, and they should be, I think that it's all coming back to haunt them now with respect to the investigations that we're undertaking, but as well as what Attorney General Barr, to his great credit, is now also undertaking.

And that's why they're turning on each other.  We're now seeing Rod Rosenstein blasting James Comey and James Comey blasting Andrew McCabe.  And it's become a circular firing squad among the deep staters who were involved in going after President Trump.  And I think when it comes to the Hillary server cover-up, another James Comey classic that I think will be studied for ages on how not to conduct a government cover-up.  maybe, I think eventually Hopefully, there will be people taken to account or held to account for the cover-up that occurred with respect to Hillary Clinton's email abuses.  Really, what you have to remember is that she was trafficking.  I made this point, as you know, many times here and elsewhere.  She was trafficking top-secret special access program material.  This is information that gets people killed if it gets exposed to our adversaries.  And we have strong reason to believe that China, Russia, and possibly Iran had hacked Hillary's server.  Representative Louie Gohmert has come out and said this publicly.  This has come out in congressional hearings, that there is\u2014 that there is a reason to believe that our foreign adversaries had hacked Hillary's system and were, in the case of China at least, getting a courtesy copy of all of her email traffic from early in her tenure as Secretary of State all the way through.
