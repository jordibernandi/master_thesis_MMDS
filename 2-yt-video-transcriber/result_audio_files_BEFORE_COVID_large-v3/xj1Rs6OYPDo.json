            "text": "The Good Thing About Being A Single Man In 2019.  There is nothing better than being at one with yourself.  Without the added burden of maintaining someone else's needs, there is a sheer brilliant majesty in living your life for you.  Now some take this as selfish or harsh but the fact is, for a man to be married or locked down and bound to a heavy relationship, means he's a man doing the most to keep his woman happy.  There is nothing wrong with that per se, but when it feels like your happiness is secondary to hers, then it becomes a problem.  Funny how men that choose to be single are seen as selfish, yet many times in relationships, men have felt their woman was the selfish one, as if her needs were greater than yours, and if you fail to keep her happy, you may lose her.  For many, the battle to keep a woman has been an ongoing pursuit of her happiness, to the detriment of many, many men.  So here are three reasons men enjoy being single.  Number one, less stress.  Many of us as men have tried our best to keep a woman happy or maintain a relationship.  So many understand how stressful that can be.  Many of us have seen that the more we did, the less we got back.  Then it becomes a game of high expectations when it should be more how two people build a life together.  Nowadays it seems as if women want us to build their lives, as if we have to exhaust everything we have just to keep her happy.  But then if she leaves you for someone else, oh, maybe you didn't try hard enough.  As well as myself, I've seen many men trying hard to support a woman who didn't deserve the exertion, let alone the stress.  Number two, money saving.  Having a woman will cost you money.  Even if it is a small amount, women will always cost you money.  The thing is, even when you have the money to burn, it becomes a game of how much is she worth to you.  How much are you willing to spend on her?  And if you have a more mild income, then it becomes a point of what will you go without so she can have.  I've met tons of women who love money but rarely have they had any good ideas on how to make money.  So a man who is focused on his earnings and not to overly spend on a woman will always retain more money than men that splurge, whether to use that money to get a woman or to keep one.  Number three, you're always committed to you.  In the freedom men find from being single, it's the joy of knowing it starts and ends with you.  As a man, you are free to roam, to work, to play, to enjoy life in all its fine detail, but it's clear for you to see your destination.  In being committed to yourself, you can do more with your life than to tie yourself to any one woman.  To affix yourself to someone who expects your undying commitment.  Being committed to yourself is less demanding and only as heartbreaking as someone who suffers in their loneliness.  But being alone does not mean loneliness.  When you occupy your life with so many grand things to do, you have less time to worry about loneliness, because you're too busy honoring the commitment you have made to yourself, committed to enjoying life, to seeking the best from yourself, committed to being the man you want to be.  Thus, always remember and never forget.  It's not illegal to take care of yourself and want to preserve yourself.  To get the best out of yourself instead of giving the best of yourself.  As men we are told we are at our best when we are giving.  When we stop holding the cards for ourselves and show our hands.  We are told to be selfless.  because any man that chooses a single bachelor life is selfish.  But only a fool would let others have dominion over them and hopes.  this person loves them for all they have done and will do.  Only a fool ignores his own value due to the value he has placed in others.  Before you choose to validate yourself based on her, ask yourself if you already have self-validation.  Because if you do not, that is something to seek for yourself before letting others give it to you.  So with that, focus.  Observe.  Remember.  The world is yours.  Have a nice day.  Thank you. ",
