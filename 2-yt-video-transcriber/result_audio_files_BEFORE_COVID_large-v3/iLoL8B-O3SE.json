            "text": "Mr.  Carlos, you probably think that this little campaign that you're running against YouTube and Steven Crowder and others that you placed in the same box because you can't seem to tell the difference between fucking Elmo and a white supremacist.  You may think that's noble, but it's everything but.  In fact, all you've done is really confirm this sort of stereotype that a lot of minorities try to utilize their minority status.  to Crofow perpetuate this false sense of victimhood just so they can de-platform people that they disagree with.  And with this whole change in policy by way of YouTube that probably came from you, they may deny it, you may deny it, I don't know.  You may take credit for it, which you should, because the time is a little weird.  But a lot of people got caught in the crossfire that had nothing to do with this shit.  People are being demonetized.  People are having their accounts suspended and so forth.  So what have you done?  You haven't helped minorities.  Instead, you've made an enemy out of a lot of individuals that didn't know who the fuck you were before you sort of started this little campaign of yours.  You block people on Twitter as it is, bro.  You can mute people.  Or you can just get the fuck off the internet.  Instead, you're on social media crying.  You're on major media crying.  And doing your damnedest to try to guilt trip people into taking other motherfuckers off of YouTube.  Just because you don't want them on there.  Just because you don't want people utilizing the platform and growing based on that.  So you cry foul.  Oh, it's the hatred.  They hate queer people.  They hate this.  They hate that.  Oh, so many people are coming at me.  Well, that's what happens when you take shots at fucking people.  You don't get to do that.  You don't get to cry foul.  You don't get to do that, homie.  All you had to do was grow a fucking sack.  And you can take that in whatever way that you may.  But instead, you've made enemies out of individuals that didn't know who the fuck you were.  Was it fucking worth it, homie?  Was it worth it? ",
