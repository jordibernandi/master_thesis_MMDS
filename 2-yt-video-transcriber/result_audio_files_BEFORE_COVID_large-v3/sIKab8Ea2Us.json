One is that there needs to be a constitutional violation. ",

In 2009, the court said that it was unnecessary for lower courts when deciding qualified immunity motions to answer the first question.  And that decision has allowed subsequent courts and the Supreme Court regularly to grant qualified immunity, holding that the law was not clearly established, without ruling on the underlying constitutional claim.  meaning that the constitutional claim regarding that case remains undefined, and it becomes increasingly hard to clearly establish the law and get past the hurdle of qualified immunity.  In the courts around the country, there is a great deal of confusion about what clearly established law means.  Can only the Supreme Court clearly establish the law?  The Supreme Court recently said that they assumed arguendo that decisions other than those by the Supreme Court could clearly establish the law.  But they've never come out and said clearly which courts can clearly establish the law. ",

I have talked to many individuals who have told me that in certain situations they knew and recognized that they were entitled to use force.  And they told me that one of the things that prevented them from doing so was the fear of being sued after the fact.  That's a dangerous situation.  Law enforcement officers must be able to do their job, including using deadly force, if it's appropriate, without that fear of liability hanging over their head. ",

So the financial justification for qualified immunity as a shield against the financial burdens of litigation is simply untrue.  The Supreme Court should reconsider qualified immunity doctrine because, as Justice Sotomayor has explained, it renders the protections of the Fourth Amendment hollow.  When the Supreme Court grants qualified immunity to officers who shoot people without justification, who shoot people against the orders of their supervisors to stand down, It sends a message to officers and to society as a whole that officers can shoot first and think later.
