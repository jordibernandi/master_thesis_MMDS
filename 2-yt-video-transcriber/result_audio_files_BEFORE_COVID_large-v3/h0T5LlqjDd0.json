We got the Porsche that they're paying for right next to the old Mercedes.  And look at this one.  It looks like the gentleman driving this car blew a .34.  This cruiser's seen better days.  So it looks like this one got into an accident with somebody.  You can see.  They got a front end collision.  All the equipment's taken out.  Yeah.  This one, this is the dangers of being a police officer.  You see that?  Running the red light.  We don't know what happened there.  I'm sorry, what'd you say, ma'am?  I'm having a hard time hearing you.  What'd you say?  You prefer?  I asked you not to videotape it.  Okay, I'd rather I did.  Why are you in this parking lot?  Why are you in this parking lot?  I'm a police officer.  Okay, I'm a citizen.  But you're not, so why are you videotaping that vehicle?  Because I wanted to videotape it.  Okay, luckily for me, I don't need your permission.  This isn't a public way.  This is a private lot.  Really?  Can you show me the sign?  Because the sign's over there.  It's all... I'll go tell the police.  No, no, no.  We can go over to the sign.  Come over to the sign.  Can you show us?  Show us the sign.  She's going to take us and she's going to show us the sign.  Why would you have to tell the police officer?  You're a police officer.  I am, but I'd rather I'm not in uniform and I don't want to deal with your bullshit.  Well, what is my bullshit?  You came and run after me.  I was nowhere even near you.  Okay, so what's the problem with that?  What's the problem?  Ma'am, where is it that says I can't be in this?  You just said it was a public police lot.  You just said it was a public police lot.  You didn't say private police lot.  You said public police lot.  Then you ran out of your way to get in front of the camera and then you have a problem being in front of the camera.  So don't run in front of the camera if you don't like being in front of the camera.  Okay, well don't run up to the camera if you don't want to be videotaped, okay?  Don't go into a barbershop if you don't get your hair cut.  Alright?  Why would you run in front of a video camera and then say, I don't want to be videotaped?  Does that make sense?  I'm asking you not to record me.  Okay, and I'm telling you it's not happening.  Yeah, all right is all you can say.  What a joke, dude.  Literally runs up to the video camera and says, I don't want to be recorded.  Are you kidding me?  She said first it's a private, now it's a public.  No, she said it was a public lot.  Let's go back over here.  It didn't say anything.  The thing's all worn out.  You can't read it.  It doesn't say anything.  It's all worn out.  You can't read it.  There.  That's what it says.  That's the sign.  You make out what that says.  Yes.  The only word on there is personnel.  Other than that, there is no other word on there.  It's been faded by the sun.  Go through traffic.  Violators will be... It does not say it's not open to the public.  There's nothing on there that says it's not open to the public.  And she said it was a public lot.  Yeah, we weren't in a car.  Exactly.  So, score one for the good guys.  How do you... Yeah, you're a cop, but I'm going to go get a cop.  I don't want to be recorded.  Here, let me rub it to you. ",
