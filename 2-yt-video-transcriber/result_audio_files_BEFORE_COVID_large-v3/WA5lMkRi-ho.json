            "text": "For a second there.  So folks, for those of you who don't know, we've had so much information in this case for so long.  Some of it we've put out, some of it we haven't put out based on security preferences and reasons.  But it's amazing right now.  So a new lawsuit filed by attorney Ty Clevenger, one of the best conservative attorneys in the country, lists Ellen Ratner, Fox News' Ellen Ratner, as one of the sources in the Seth Rich murder investigation.  For those of you that aren't aware, Ellen's brother, Michael Ratner, just happens to be an attorney for a guy, or used to be an attorney for a guy named Julian Assange.  So when you look at the clarity here and you look at things that are happening here, it's going to be really, really hard to say that she doesn't know what she is talking about.  And so think about that for a second.  When you're talking about she's a Fox News producer, contributor, whatever you want to call her, and then on top of that her brother was Julian Assange's attorney, it's very, very damning what we see right here.  and what we do.  So, folks, you know, you can listen to us right now live on Spreaker.com, of course, on Twitter, and Periscope will be up a little bit later on YouTube.  And then we're also working on getting a DLive channel up as well and some other platforms for you.  If you're having issues, all I can tell you is log out, log back in.  That's all I can tell you.  There's not much else I can do.  I am by far and away probably one of the most censored journalists, investigators, whatever you want to call me, on the Internet.  And so that's the best way I can have it.  They're going to censor me.  You're going to have to learn to deal with it, folks.  That's how this works.  They don't want you to hear what I have to say.  If you've been following me long enough, you know that's been the betterment of two years.  They do not want what I have to say to get out to the public and to the masses.  What I want you to understand is the ramifications of this with Ellen Ratner.  Not only is she a bigwig with Fox News, not only was her brother Julian Assange's a freak, she's listed now as a source of intel for Ed Butowski in the Seth Rich lawsuit.  We knew about Ellen Ratner and had known about Ellen for quite some time, and it's one of those things where now that stuff is being filed, it's just the things are starting to fly.  Something else that I want you to do, too, 3.30 p.m.  Central Standard Time, I'm going to have another announcement and information in this lawsuit.  I'm going to be very, very frank, and I'm going to mention somebody because, you know what, you're going to find out about it anyway.  It is already in the lawsuit.  We've already reported it.  It will be filed.  And so at 3.30 Central Time, I have another big announcement in this Seth Ridge lawsuit and another source, which has to do with Julian Assange and how he paid certain individuals for information.  So at 3.30 p.m.  Central Standard Time, I want you to mark that down.  That's 4.30 for those of you on the East Coast, and, of course, that's 1.30 on the West Coast Pacific Standard Time.  I'll be back live, and we're going to be talking about some information on who was our source.  in the information of who Julian Assange paid and how he paid them.  And we're going to talk about that information as well and get it out there.  3.30 Central Standard Time there. ",

            "text": "well folks how about that?  uh Should have played that leading into, but wanted to show this headline first.  Been in touch with Mr.  Couch, been a supporter and friend for a long time, over two and a half years now.  Folks, what can I say?  You know, it's true journalist.  investigators like this team have got to know pretty much a majority of the team over the last two years.  Big shout out to Josh Flippo and Bill Pierce as well.  You know, Matt pretty much states it right there at the end.  Wanted to play that small excerpt of that periscope that he did earlier today.  Spoke with him after that.  Folks, it's time to take the gloves off leading into the 2020 presidential election.  And it's time for the truth to be known.  We told you it was coming.  And I've been a supporter, also, fighting alongside with them to get the truth about the DNC and what really happened to Seth Rich.  And also,  i.e.,  the supposedly Russian collusion delusional hack,  etc.,  etc.  Well, the truth's coming, folks.  And I'm hoping that we're working on it now.  Big shows coming up, possibly one next week with Red Pill 78.  Working out the details right now with Matt and his team coming on and talking about this lawsuit.  But let's look into this here.  Lawsuit out Fox News.  This Ratner as source for Seth Rich.  Check this headline out right off for the DCPatriot.com website.  Fox News analyst Ms.  Ratner relayed information from WikiLeaks founder of JA to Texas businessman Ed Bartowski.  Remember him?  Regarding Seth Rich and his role in transferring the emails to WikiLeaks according to an amended lawsuit that I filed this morning on behalf of Mr.  Bartowski.  Although Ms.  Ratner appears on Fox News, she is by no means a Republican or a conservative.  In her role in the SR saga, like that of journalist Cy Hirsch, arbitrates the Democratic narrative, the right-wing fabricated story about Mr.  Rich leaking emails from the Democratic National Committee, the DNC.  So there you go, folks, breaking.  The truth will always be set free.  Just buckle up, hold on, get your popcorn ready, because it's coming.  We're going to see the truth and so many other truths, you know.  Like those individuals that were supposedly in Seattle, but no, they were in D.C.  because they didn't cut their phone locator device, GPS.  Any of that off?  Any of that?  ring a bell?  Well, get ready, folks.  It's coming.  Big shout out to Matt Couch and his team.  It's about time that we see some fruition.  And looks like we're going to see some traction here.  coming up pretty soon.  Other headlines here.  Here we go with the MSM narrative leading into the 2020 election.  Get the picture?  Well, let me read it for you.  Black home ownership drops to all-time low.  Don't really believe that.  EU agrees to sanction Turkey for drilling In the waters off of, the international waters off of Turkey, that is.  More stories coming out of the EU about sanctioning Turkey for the weapon system that I covered two days ago.  So more news coming out of Turkey.  More sanctioned talks.  Trump moves to effectively end asylum at southern border.  Racist disgrace.  Miss Rice slams Chinese diplomat who says black families ruin white neighborhoods.  You catching the drift?  Catching the angle that they're starting to work towards the 2020 election?  It's always the same.  Just like when Trump came out and responded to those folks on the, you know, Twitter board the other day.  Lo and behold, gets called a racist yet again.  Jeffrey Epstein will remain jailed as Judge Mules Bell.  Can't even believe he's mewling over it.  He's a flight risk, folks.  More evidence is piling by the day.  What is in the secret Prince Andrew sex slave files?  Well, let's see.  I don't know.  Let's check that out.  Appeals court orders release of 2,000 documents related to Jeffrey Epstein trafficking case.  A judge in the US has ordered the release of thousands of secret documents relating to sex offender Mr.  Epstein, a move that threatens potential embarrassment for Prince Andrew.  You bet it does.  What are the accusations against Epstein, 66-year-old financier, we still don't know the true occupation of this gentleman, over claims that he recruited girls as young as 14 into a sex trafficking ring based out of his homes in New York and Palm Beach and the island, remember, L Express?  Hello.  He pleaded not guilty to two charges of sex trafficking of minors in Manhattan Federal Court last week.  If convicted, he will face 45 years in prison, more of the same that we've heard.  And now we're seeing more evidence piling against others, as well as this gentleman listed above, Prince Andrew.  So check out this headline, folks.  It's a doozy.  The dominoes.  are continuing to fall.  A couple other headlines here.  Ebola spread to East Congo's.  Goma massively raises risk, according to the UN.  Check out this router's headline.  The world's second worst epidemic has infected 2,500 people and killed 1,655 in the lush farmlands of eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo.  Why isn't there any MSM headlines covered nightly on this?  I wonder why.  UN officials and donors meet in Geneva to discuss how to tackle the world's second worst epidemic, which has infected 2,500 people and killed over 1,600.  As I just read you, the toxic mix of armed militias and a deep-rooted mistrust of health officials by communities have hampered efforts to halt the virus.  I can't imagine.  Goma, a lakeside city more than 350 kilometers south of where the outbreak was first detected, got its first case on Sunday, raised fears Ebola could accelerate into one of Africa's most densely populated areas over the Rwanda border.  The case in Goma could potentially be a game changer in this epidemic, which we know it's already come in this country via the border, more of a reason to secure the border.  The patient who brought Ebola to Goma was a priest who became infected during a visit in the town, 200 kilometers, 124 miles that is, north of Goma, where he interacted with Ebola patients, Congo's health ministry said in a statement.  So there you go, more headlines, more news of this intensely spreading epidemic.  Second worst, latest on the Ebola.  And this gentleman says FBI and CIA should probe Google.  You think?  Check that headline out.  It's a doozy.  Network of Chinese concentration camps uncovered.  Check that headline out.  And back in the news, Ms.  Obama.  Obama presidency had no scandal.
