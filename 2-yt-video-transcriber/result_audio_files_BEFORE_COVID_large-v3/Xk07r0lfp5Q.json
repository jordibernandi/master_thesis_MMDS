Or are they thinking about this entire world being run by maniacs from London and from Washington and from Paris?  Yes.  Would they sacrifice again the rest of the world if their personal lives would improve?  I doubt it.  I hope they would want the entire world to improve, but very often it feels that they are talking about their waking up is just addressing the grievances they have towards the regime.  Basically what happened is that what is done to the English people now was always done to the colonists.  Much worse things were done to the colonies, but essentially this is what was done to the colonies.  And they never cared.  But now the system went mad and they are starting to do what they never did in the past.  They start to treat their own people in London, in Manchester, in Glasgow, they start to treat their own people as they used to treat people somewhere in Karachi. ",
