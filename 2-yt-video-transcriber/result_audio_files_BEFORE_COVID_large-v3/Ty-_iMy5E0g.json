It's been translated by memory, so Middle Eastern Media Research Institute.  And it's Dr.  Mariam Al-Sohal who claims to have qualifications in sex management.  And she appeared on a Kuwaiti channel, Scope TV, to sell suppositories that she claims kills worm-making men gay.  And she said that homosexuality persists because of anal worms that feed on semen.  The academic adds that, by the way, this is all science, so there's nothing to be ashamed of.  Of course not.  It's prophetic medicine.  It's all in the books.  At first I couldn't make sense of this very odd story.  What basically seems to be going on is that this is a quack who has been given airtime on television.

I don't know they didn't mention any of anything about semen-eating worms that managed to Brainwash you to have more gay sex.  I mean, I don't.  obviously.  first of all, it's not like When gay people want to have gay sex, it's not just the physical part of it that they enjoy, right?  They're also attracted to the same sex, right?  So it's not like they just want something up their butt.  This worm is pretty fucking advanced if it also manages to alter your mind in a way for you to find the same sex attractive.  Another thing is, I don't understand how this works with lesbians.  So what is it like... I don't think she even thought about this.  Okay, so there's no Hadith in Islam that supports this.  But if you want to talk about prophetic medicine, we're talking about a source.  If you read the Hadith in Islam... There's also a hadith that says that if you are drinking water and a fly falls into... Look this up, people.  I'm not making this shit up, okay?  This is prophetic medicine.  This is real prophetic medicine, okay?  If a fly drops into your drink, Before drinking your water, dip the fly fully inside your water before you drink it.  Okay?  Again, I'm not making this up.  Look this up.  And the reason, this is Hadith Bukhari.  This is one of the most authentic sources of Hadith when it comes to Islamic sources, right?  And the reason for this is every fly, every fly, the two wings of every fly has, one of its wings has a poison in it.  And the other wing of the fly has the cure to that poison.  So if a fly... So if a fly falls into your drink, you have to dip it all in because you don't know which... wing, maybe only the poison wing touched the water.  So before drinking it, you have to dip it fully in to make sure you also got the medicine for that poison before you drink that water.  This is authentic Islamic Hadith.  Go look it up.  I'm not making this shit up.  And this is what this woman considers a source.  By the way, I don't know if this woman was anywhere even remotely close to the scientific community.  She would know that if she ever had discovered a worm that could brainwash people's minds like that, she would be getting like a Nobel Prize or something in medicine, like a worm that could actually alter a human brain like that for them to become gay.  Like this, she would be the most famous biologist in the fucking world by now if she had discovered something like that.  Jesus Christ. ",

It's not the only thing they do, and some people, some gay men just are not into anal sex at all.  They do different things, you know, manual or oral sex.  There's many things, and it's not like.  this is what you definitely do if you're gay.  And, you know, there's also heterosexual couples who practice anal sex.  So this is...
