There is a solution, the patent-pending gun bed.  The gun bed is quite possibly the biggest breakthrough in home defense since the invention of the firearm.  The gun bed allows fast access to a firearm while keeping it secure, off the floor, out of the closet or the nightstand, and away from curious children when locked.  In the event you hear an intruder and think it would be wise to investigate, the shotgun can quietly be removed, although I used the loudest racking shotgun I could find because the last sound an intruder wants to hear is the sound of a shotgun racking a shell.  That sound is a universal language that may cause an intruder to flee without any confrontation at all.  Notice the muzzle goes past the second person's head, and the natural movement brings it farther away from your loved one.  For this reason, never store a pistol in the gun bed. ",

The multi-locks are the highest security locks available in the industry.  The safe carries a two-hour fire rating, holds up to 35 rifles and 70 handguns.  Many people have asked me how long does it take to access your Bed Bunker.  It takes less than 10 seconds.  Guns are right beneath you so you can access them in a hurry.  The door weighs 140 pounds and is spring loaded so when you unlock the locks the door pops open.  Each section of the bed safe weighs 650 pounds.  The safe is made of 10 gauge steel on the body and the doors are made of quarter inch steel.  The complete safe powder-coated and comes with a lifetime warranty.  We all get half a queen bed bunker and there's a safe and it's.  it's very wide and it's very long so it'll accommodate someone that's up to like seven three.  Voila, you got a very comfortable couch.  And as you can see, I'm a little over six feet.  There's plenty of room, extra room at the end to sleep. ",

He's with Liberty Home Concealment out of Norwood, Missouri.  Cool thing about this thing is you can get a magnetic or electronic card for this thing.  It's got a little lock inside for some storage.  Got a large compartment down here at the bottom and then a small one up top.  As you can see, I've put my Glock 19 in here.  Got room, space for another cutout to put another pistol in there.  Hopefully I do a little better cutting it out than I did on my 19, but hey, trial and error.  But this thing is awesome.  Beautiful.  This is really cool.  I really like this thing. ",

You can have this sitting right on your dinner table.  You can have this full of apples and bananas or your bread for the evening.  And there's your firearm right there.  I started in this because just on a lark, a couple of my girlfriends and I took a concealed carry class.  I'd never held a gun in my hands ever until then.  I found it very empowering.  Then about six months later, I got laid off.  And I was looking for furniture like this and couldn't find it anywhere.  So then that's when I decided, well, if I'm looking for it, then there's got to be other people looking for it as well.  Here's our bedside table.  A lot of people really love this piece because of the simplicity and great style.  Both sides open up so you can have your firearm right next to your bed in a beautiful little table.  that still functions the way it should.  And again, solid wood construction.  Here's a console table.  Functions much the same as this one.  Side pops down, but this one will hold a long gun as well.  So you can have a handgun in each end, long gun across the back.  Can be sitting in the middle of your living room looking gorgeous and nobody needs to be the wiser.  We call this our step back curio cabinet.  And this is fun because it is so well concealed.  We just have fun with this one.  There's a little lever up here.  That opens.  This opens, there's four inches of space back there, so you could have one side for jewelry, one side for firearms, the whole thing for firearms, the whole thing for jewelry.  People have done it both ways.  And then the bottom opens on this as well.  Luckily, we have this fantastic resource.  that's about an hour south of where I live, which is the largest Amish community in the world.  And there's a lot of unbelievably good furniture makers down there.  And I found a really, really good one who makes all this beautiful furniture for me.  It's all coming out of the same workshop down there.  So everything is made one at a time, by hand, to order.  Everything is custom built, so you get exactly what you want. ",

What you see in front of you is a typical sofa table, but this one has a secret.  36 inches tall, 12 inches deep, and about 5 feet long.  This one has a two and a half inch deep hidden storage compartment right here that is secured by a magnetic lock.  What we've done is we've recessed a rare earth magnet in the bottom of this piece right here.  And when we put it over the area where the magnetic lock is, it unlocks it and gives us access to the top.  So whether you're trying to secure firearms because you have children in the home, or maybe you just want to have a place where you can have access to something that no one else knows about, this is going to be the thing for you.
