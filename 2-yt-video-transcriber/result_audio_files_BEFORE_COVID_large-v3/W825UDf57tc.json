The plant has a fascinating history dating back to 1903, designed by renowned architect Albert Kahn.  At one time, the Packard Motor Car Company was a leading manufacturer of luxury automobiles.  After World War II, consumers came to see Packard as having lost its flair.  Cadillac surpassed Packard, which found its lineup of upscale vehicles a poor fit for a growing middle class.
