That way if you see something that you find offensive you can click on it and voila problem solved.  Seems that most other browsers have replaced the back button with this.  And once you hit it, the author of the offending remark gets canvassed by the Thought Police, as exampled by this week's featured video.  For once, I'll keep my commentary brief as the contents of the video speak for itself, and I'm sure this is just one of many Orwellian instances yet to come, but I can't resist highlighting the multiple reasons that the police give for being on this man's doorstep.
