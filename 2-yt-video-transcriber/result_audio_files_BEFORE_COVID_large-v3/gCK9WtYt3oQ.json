            "text": "Hi, everyone.  I'm Barry Stagner, and this is a Channel News break.  Hong Kong's airport halted flights on Monday, blaming demonstrators for the disruption, while China said the anti-government protests that have swept the city over the past two months have begun to show sprouts of terrorism.  The airport authority said it was working with airlines to resume flights from 6 a.m.  on Tuesday, but the developments raised the stakes sharply after a weekend of skirmishes during which both activists and police toughened their stances.  The precise trigger for the airport's closure was not clear, since protesters occupying the arrivals hall for four days have been peaceful.  Most of them had left shortly after midnight, but around 50 remain discussing their next move.  This is about our freedom, a 24-year-old protester wearing a mask who gave his name only as you, told Reuters during the evening.  Why should we leave?  Some Hong Kong legal experts say official descriptions of some protesters' actions as terrorism could lead to the use of extensive anti-terror laws and powers against them.  China's People's Armed Force Police assembled in the neighboring city of Shenzhen for exercises, the state-backed Global Times newspaper said.  And the Communist Party's official daily newspaper said on the Twitter-like Weibo that the force can handle the incidents, including riots or terrorist attacks.  Hong Kongers responded again by taking to the streets.  Crowds picketed a police station, sang hymns.  Hundreds of people returned to a subway station where police had hit activists with batons to protect against these heavy-handed tactics.  The increasingly violent demonstrations have plunged the Chinese-ruled territory into its most serious crisis in decades, presenting Chinese leader Xi Jinping with one of his biggest challenges since he came to power in 2012.  Hong Kong has come to a critical juncture, said Hong Kong and Macau affairs spokesman Yang Guang in Beijing.  Protesters have been frequently using extremely dangerous tools to attack the police in recent days, constituting serious crimes with sprouts of terrorism emerging.  The protests began in opposition to a bill allowing extraditions to the mainland for trial in communist-controlled courts, but have widened to highlight other grievances winning broad support.  Demonstrators say they are fighting the erosion of one country, two systems arrangement, enshrining some autonomy for Hong Kong when China took it back from Britain in 1997.  A majority of Britons believe Prime Minister Boris Johnson must take Britain out of the European Union by any means, even if that involves suspending Parliament, an opinion poll conducted for the Daily Telegraph said on Monday.  Johnson has promised to lead Britain out of the EU on October 31st, regardless of whether he manages to secure an exit deal with Brussels, despite many in Parliament being opposed to leaving without a deal.  A Congress opinion poll showed 54% of respondents said they agreed with the statement, Boris Johnson needs to deliver Brexit by any means, including suspending Parliament if necessary, in order to prevent members of Parliament from stopping it.  Johnson is seeking a deal with the EU but has not ruled out suspending Parliament to prevent lawmakers' attempts to block a no-deal exit.  The poll showed 46% disagreed with the statement, and the result was based on the answers of 1,645 respondents after those who said they did not know their preference had been excluded.  Well, we know the EU is going to be at the heart of the revived Roman Empire during the tribulation period.  And we would expect to see them in the news in these last days, giving us today's reminder to keep looking up. ",
