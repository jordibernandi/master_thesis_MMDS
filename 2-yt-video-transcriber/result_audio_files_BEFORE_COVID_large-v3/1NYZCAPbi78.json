            "text": "Oh, hey.  Someone was calling in saying suspicious to God's camera.  What are we doing?  I'm sorry, I can't hear you very well.  I'm hard of hearing.  What was that?  Who are you guys with?  Someone called in and said... What do you mean, who am I with?  Can you make this signal?  13?  Yeah.  I'm trying to find out who it is.  Well, freedom of the press is a constitutionally protected activity.  I got you.  It's not any trouble.  I'm just trying to find out what, that's all I can let them know.  No, what if I told you that I'm with agoraphobics of anonymous, and you're not doing anything to dispel their fears?  Okay.  You know what an agoraphobe is?  I don't.  It's people that are afraid to leave their house, and they want to know what the sheriff's deputy station looks like, or the sheriff's office looks like, so we go in and record it.  Okay.  I'm just saying, what if I told you that was it?  That's that.  All right.  Yeah.  Great.  That's not the truth.  I was just saying, what if?  It could be, though.  It could be, you know what I mean?  Yeah, actually, I do.  Yes, please.  Very professional.  It's called BANG.  Yeah.  Bolt Action News Group.  What does it focus on?  Civil rights amendments and... guys have like a problem with?  No, no, I don't have a ill will or ill intent.  Nothing at all.  I'm a professional.  I have two other jobs and two kids.  No, sir.  Yeah.  All right.  Any questions?  Nope.  Thanks.  Stay safe.  Hang on.  I think this is the owner.  He called him on us.  L-N-U-4-5-3-V-5-3 L-N-U-V-5-3 L-N-U-V-5-3 L-N-U-V-5-3 L-N-U-V-5-3 L-N-U-V-5-3 L-N-U-V-5-3 L-N-U-V-5-3 L-N-U-V-5-3 L-N-U-V-5-3 L-N-U-V-5-3 L-N-U-V-5-3 L-N-U-V-5-3 L-N-U-V-5-3 L-N-U-V-5-3 L-N-U-V-5-3 L-N-U-V-5-3 L-N-U-V-5-3 L-N-U-V-5-3 L-N-U-V-5.  And he's still there.  He's probably going to try to ID us.  And like you said, you obtained permission before we even left there.  Right.  I made sure of that.  I should have recorded that part though.  Deputy Studd.  Studd.  Studd.  Studd?  Probably pronounced Studd.  Yeah.  We can't go around the block.  But no, I want to make sure he doesn't try to run my planks.  Because if he does, I want to do records requests on that.  He illegally went through David.  He'll probably try to say, why not?  Yeah.  No, he just hid behind the... The sign, yeah.  Oh, he's backing out.  He's leaving.  Oh, did he say something about that?  Why isn't he going?  There he goes.  Oh no, he's backing up.  Yeah.  I know, right?  Yeah.  Hey, I did have one more question, Deputy.  What's that?  Who does your 911 dispatch?  I'm not sure.  You're not sure who does your 911?  Nope.  I do have a quick question for you guys, though.  Owner here doesn't want... Is that your vehicle right there?  I am not answering any of those questions.  Okay, I'm just making sure, because he's going to get towed here in a second, because he doesn't want, whoever's parking it is not being a customer.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  As long as it's not yours, I want to make sure.  Yeah, no, it shouldn't be towed.  That person I know has permission.  Okay, well, the owner does.  It's prior property, so the owner can kind of do what he wants.  Right, objective documentation of proof of permission of parking.  Okay, yeah.  All right, well, you guys are good to go.  Any other questions for me?  Yeah, uh, retaliatory tactics, uh, did you solicit that?  The what?  Retaliatory tactic of getting the car towed, is that solicited?  No, not at all, he just asked me, uh, if you guys own the vehicle, because he doesn't know... When did he ask you that?  Just now, he came over to talk to me.  Oh, is that right?  Yeah.  I didn't see that.  So, he said you guys have been in this place now, so he's getting a little worried, he just wanted to make sure... That I've been here twice now?  Yep, same vehicle, same people.  That's incorrect.  I told him you guys were just doing a blog online or something about civil rights, right?  Yeah, we're trying to get records requests.  Yeah, so... I came the 3rd of July and it's been 22 days.  I was just wondering.  What did they say?  Do you need to talk to them?  No, I just put it in again with more stuff that I'm requesting.  Yeah, it just keeps compiling more and more.  Yeah, no, just where we can obtain that 911 call.  Yeah.  911 call, they can do that.  If you give me some name, I can look into the back story.  What's the back story?  Like, what's involved here?  The call that you said.  Hey, Deputy, what's your name and number?  Howard, how are you?  Great, fantastic.  What's your ID number?  Good.  It's 58652.  58652, thank you for being professional.  Fantastic.  Yeah.  How are you?  Good.  Did I say that right?  Yep, you did.  How many people get that right?  I do all right up and down.  What are you guys doing today?  It's just putting in a records request again.  Can I review that please?  Yeah, well, actually, that is public record as... Yeah, but I have to review it to make sure it's the same one.  No, I'm not a public employee.  No, it's not.  You have a duty to show me that, please.  Are you ignoring that, Debbie?  He doesn't want it on there.  So they're saying it's not their vehicle.  I didn't say that.  I'm saying that the people that own that vehicle had permission.  So, therefore, he doesn't want it on there.  Well, he told me it's going to be on him.  So, again, one more chance.  Deputy, you want to show me that picture?  Nope.  You refused to show me the public record.  Well, I want to review them and make sure it's the same one.  And it wasn't doctored or anything.  Okay.  Can I see it, please?  Are you guys just going to do this on your own kind of thing, or are you guys with an organization?  Well, I don't answer those kinds of questions.  I did already answer it already.  I just don't like repeating myself.  Hold action, news do.  Hold action, news do.  Civil rights.  They're not focusing on ours.  They're just focusing on general.  Oh, okay.  There's nothing we can do.  I got it.  Yeah, I mean, I can only go so much without information.  I don't know what I'm doing.  You know Corporal Morgan?  Morgan?  Do you?  Yeah, he was our corporal.  He was?  No?  No, I mean, he got promoted.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But he was the day shift corporal, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Who are you under now?  Oh.  You have a sergeant?  I do.  Okay.  Okay.  What's your sergeant's name?  Sergeant Horton.  Sergeant Horton.  Yeah.  All right.  You got a business card too, Tanner?  I do.  Can I get that?  Sure.  All I could see, you know.  Sure, yeah.  It's kind of wet because I'm out here working in the rain.  Helping citizens while it's pouring rain outside.  It's hardly pouring, sir.  Are you prior service?  Were you in the military at all?  I was earlier.  What branch?  That's my personal information.  Oh, okay.  All right.  All right.  What branch?  Army.  All right.  I was in the Marine Corps.  All right.  But I'm still holding an umbrella.  So is he going to solicit a trespass or something?  Yeah, that's not very legal, is it?  Soliciting a trespass is not illegal.  Well, he's asking them right now if they want us to get out of here, right?  I don't want to answer those questions.  Right on.  Stay safe.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Absolutely last chance.  Let me see that picture.  Nope, not happening.  All right.  Have you ever been in this situation before?  Yeah.  What kind of situation are we in?  Where you take a picture of a civilian and they ask to review it?  Yes, sir.  Got me on tape?  Yes, sir.  You got out of that car, right?  Yes, sir.  You came inside and asked me if you could park there?  Yes, sir.  So it's your car, right?  Yes, sir.  Why you lie to him and tell him it's not your car?  I never lied to him.  All right, give me a favor.  Get the car out of there.  No, I said I didn't want to answer that.  I don't want to be involved in all this bullshit.  I've got to go to work like a good guy.  Go to work, be a productive guy.  Get your car out of there before I tell you.  I have two professions.  All right?  All right.  So get it out of there before I tell it, all right?  You got it.  These are my neighbors.  Super Sardos.  Yeah, Super Sardos.  You got it.  Super Sardos.  Right on, right on.  Get it out of there.  Right on.  All right, Denhart solicited a trespass.  What's that?  I was just documenting.  I'm narrating the video.  Do you want the trespass from here too?  Hey, can you come here real quick?  Hey, can you tell me that one quicker?  On video too.  Oh, this is perfect.  I got him on video asking him for the trespass.  Wow.  That's illegal.  You're learning today for fun and for free.  That's illegal.  For fun and for free.  You cannot solicit a trespass.  Do you find something funny about trampling on rights?  You do?  So he walked inside.  Did he come out here and tell you that you're trespassing or something like that?  So you guys are free to go.  He wants you to move your car.  I saw everything that happened.  There's an objective documentation of what just happened.  Your false narrative doesn't apply.  And it's not funny to trample on rights.  Stay safe.  Hey, let me tell you one more thing, guys.  Deputies, one more thing.  I have family and friends with bad guys.  I'm doing this, aside from my two professions, to make sure that the bad guys aren't in your ranks.  So you don't have to worry about not getting backed up on a call because you called them out.  I don't have to worry about the thin blue line.  Thank you, sir.  I'll be there, all right?  Yeah.
