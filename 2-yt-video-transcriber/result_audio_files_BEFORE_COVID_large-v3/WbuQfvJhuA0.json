And I watched a couple of 16-year-old kids do a drug deal on the corner, and I went, how does that kid not know he might be a great guitar player or that that other kid might be a drummer?  And it just struck me right.  then, why don't we open that?  Give them that alternative to go there.  And it ended up here. ",

Finally, I looked in the mirror and it looked like my makeup, but it was blood coming down.  I think I might've been hallucinating.  I don't know.  Flushed the rock down the toilet.  I woke up and I called her and I said, it's done.  And she goes, right.  She said, you have to prove it.  One of the deals was we start going to church.  I knew who Christ was, Jesus Christ was.  And I was denying him.  I knew that there had to either come a point where I either accepted Christ and started living that life.  Or if I died in this, I was in a lot of trouble.  And that's what really motivated me.  I just got to a point of saying, I'm tired of this life.  And I know that this is right.  When the Lord opens your eyes and you suddenly realize who you are and who he is.  Oh, it's a whole different world.  I went to my pastor and I said, I think I got to quit being Alice Cooper now.  He says, look where he put you.  What if you're Alice Cooper, but what if you're now following Christ and you're a rock star, but you don't live the rock star life.  Your lifestyle is now your testimony. ",
