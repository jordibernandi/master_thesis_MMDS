            "text": "Good morning, good morning, BigSweerRoadToRoad.com with your morning horn of Zs, your sip of coffee.  All right, my camera's not working, so it's not on.  Got an email from Dick Allgaier with an interesting picture.  Again, if you guys haven't signed up yet, go sign up at Crypto Viewing Patreon.  These guys are unbelievable.  It's really cool.  So go sign up.  Support our friends.  But check out the picture that Dick sent me.  This is for his October, I think this is 90-day outlook.  The things he sees coming in October.  Look at what he saw for October.  Mid-October, Monday the 14th.  The gasping of people as it relates, I believe, as it relates to the financial system.  So there's another date to stick in your file.  Obviously, it could happen at any time.  The mass chaos is already happening, truthfully.  The bailouts, as I reported yesterday, are gigantic.  And they have just literally took the top off of all of them.  As of Monday, $75 billion plus can be borrowed by the banks.  Otherwise, bailout overnight.  And they added a whole bunch of 6-day, 14-day, you name it, all the way through November.  It is a sign to the world that people have lost faith in the U.S.  dollar.  I expect chaos by mid-October, absolutely, 100%.  Definitely by the end of the year, the world's going to look very different, either through bailouts, which would mean we kick the can down the road, A larger bailout, it couldn't be done through the Fed.  People are saying, well, why can't the Fed just keep doing this?  Because they are going to be losing confidence.  And fiat money is a confidence game.  And this is so in your face that even the good guys will want to pull the plug.  Yes, they can flood the market with money and the stock markets can still crash because it's all run off computer programs.  And that's the idea is to destroy the old system.  Both sides want it destroyed and start something new.  So October 14th, it's rare that these guys come out with a date.  They weren't real specific about it.  It's just people covering their faces going, oh, my God.  I added the oh, my God.  part.  But Monday the 14th is a date, mid-October.  And it makes sense.  So it would be a week of people next week saying, oh, my God, the Fed's just flooding the system with money.  And then the weekend comes.  Friday, you have a huge repo.  And then Monday, crash.  Is it going to happen that way?  I don't know.  But so far, so good on the road to root timing.  We're in January.  kind of the middle of the banker bailouts.  It'll get worse and worse and worse.  And then come November is when the current system of overnights and short-term repos ends.  And they'll get bigger and bigger and bigger, as I've shown on my, what is it called?  The chart, the chart that I had up yesterday.  Go check out yesterday's video.  You'll see it.  We do go exponential.  I can show it, you know, like a couple days before right here.  This is from a Friday road trip.  That's not it.  It's the one right behind it.  For you guys, this is the private road area.  Go check out private road if you're interested.  It's got archives going back, I don't even know how many years, since 2010.  Right here.  So dark is the con of the repo markets.  And there is the exponential track.  It's been extended a little bit down to like, I think we're at, I'm looking for $20 trillion for them to go to the U.S.  Congress and say, we need $20 trillion.  As of Monday, this will start to jump again and then more and more and more and then it hits exponential.  So by November, I think they're going to go to Congress and say we need $20 trillion bailout.  Then it's down to us.  Will we bail them out or will we not?  And I'm voting for the not part.  So just so you know.  And Dick sees something coming for mid-October.  Probably some kind of stock market crash.  Something visible so that it's not behind the scenes.  You don't have to understand the repo market.  But it's more visible for people.  Maybe banks freezing up.  And oh, by the way, did I tell you?  The banks are already freezing up.  Bank crisis hits India.  Bank stops functioning.  People crying outside bank branches.  Poojam Nashtara Cooperative Bank, PMC, in India has been caught cooking the books and misreporting non-performing loans of a Dubai real estate developer, housing development infrastructure, HDIL.  As Reuters reports, PMC hit the bad loans with 21,000 fictitious accounts, which has spooked depositors and government officials.  Bloomberg says PMC loan book had a 73% exposure to HDIL's failed real estate holdings.  And people are, here we go.  The Reserve Bank of India took over PMC last week and has prevented the bank from new loan creation while nearly 900,000 depositors have been informed that capital controls are being placed on their accounts for six months.  If you don't have your money out of the bank, you are going to lose it.  I don't care if you're in India, in Russia, in China, or in the USA.  If you have money in a bank, you will lose it.  Dozens of videos have been uploaded to social media this week detailing how depositors are being locked out of their accounts.  Some fear the worst, as the bank has likely failed.  One depositor said he lost all his money in the PMC banking crisis.  And is that all?  Here we have Hong Kong.  As Hong Kong ATMs run out of cash, central bank steps in to prevent a panic among the public.  Confidence is gone.  The best thing about the Hong Kong banking crisis is they know about Bitcoin.  They know about Bitcoin.  As a matter of fact, look at local Bitcoin's volume.  Look at the volume.  This is the volume through 2015, 16, 17, 18, 19.  And look what happened.  Just recently.  The highest spike ever.  Look at that.  And it's going to get bigger and bigger as the ATMs stop functioning in Hong Kong.  So things are happening.  Get ready.  Interesting conspiracy side report.  Supposedly the military has ordered the deployment within the U.S.  to help civil authorities.  They're expecting mass chaos.  I don't know if this is true, but there's all these reports from the U.S.  military that Things just got incredibly serious in the United States with the widespread talk of civil war potentially breaking out in America.  The U.S.  Marine Corps was issued a signed order shown below on deploying inside the U.S.  to assist civilian authorities in an event of an emergency.  This is the first tangible proof that people inside FedGov are extremely concerned about events taking place inside the country and what may develop here.  I don't know if this is true or not.  But it wouldn't, you know, given these faces that Dick Allgaier has drawn for Monday the 14th with a date, it's not surprising that they're going to want the military out there in the streets saying, hey, Kate, everybody chill out, calm down as we transition.  Anyway, that's what's going on on the road to Ruta.  Hope you guys have a lovely weekend. ",

So I know they're cheating, lying, and stealing.  And Google does the same thing and Facebook and Twitter.  It is horrific that they are trying to stop free speech in the USA.  So I wrote a song about them.  And the song's called They.  And it talks about things you can't say on YouTube.  It has 5,000 views on YouTube.  It's never made a penny in revenue.  And they show ads on it, but they never pay me for it.  Bastards.  I know.  So it talks about 9-11.  It talks about chemtrails.  It talks about socialism.  And it's called They.  I grew up in the USA, I was taught that speech was free.  Birmingham to Burning Man, you can speak any truth.  you see Lately things have changed, they say I can't speak truth no more And I'm just sitting here wondering who they are working for.  And they, they're gonna kick me off of YouTube Unless I say 9-11's just another day.  And they delete my friends on Facebook.  Unless I say that socialism's a-okay.  And they gonna shadow ban my Twitter.  Unless I say that chemtrails are peri-age.  And finally they'll ban everything I've got to say.  as they kill free speech in the USA.  They decide what's right, they decide what's wrong, they ban what won't conform.  They sit in shadows, they run the gallows, say I must abide the norm.  But without free speech we lose freedom, they cut off our free will.  If I find truth that they don't like, they label me a shill.  And they are gonna kick me off of YouTube.  Unless I say 9-11's just another day.  And they delete my friends on Facebook.  Unless I say that socialism's a-okay.  And they are gonna shadow ban my Twitter.  Unless I tweet that chemtrails are pariates.  And finally they'll ban everything I've got to say as they kill free speech in the USA.  They're trying to kill free speech in the USA.  Now wait a minute.  It's not like me to give up on a fight.  I'll expose their evil plans, turn their darkness into light.  And I'll name names, I'll play their games, I've got them in my sights.  They're trying to change the USA, I'll fight for what is right.  So they, they can kick me off of YouTube.  9-11's all about building seven and it ain't okay.  And they delete my friends on Facebook.  But socialism fails every time and every single way.  And they, they can shadow ban my Twitter.  But I'm looking up at Kim Trails guys each and every day.  See, they have no right to ban anything I've got to say.  And I'll fight for free speech in the USA.  I'm gonna fight for free speech in the USA.  It's my right, free speech in the USA. ",
