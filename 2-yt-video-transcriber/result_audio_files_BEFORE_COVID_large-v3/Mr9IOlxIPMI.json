            "text": "What's up, heathens?  How ya doin'?  Today we have more comments to go through, but first, we have to crown the winner from last week.  So last week's winner was... This idiot right here!  yes you with the weird diatribe with the weirdly misspelled words and then you tie it all up at the end with yeah fuck valentine's day too that one threw me for a loop.  i'm glad that all of you heathens out there voted for this one because i really wanted this one to win And I'm glad that it did by a large amount.  So thank you so much for voting.  If you picked this comment from last week, then you win a million god points.  Remember, these god points were worth as much as a fake national emergency issued by Trump.  Make sure you vote for the dumbass of the week this week.  Hey, speaking of dumbasses, somebody thinks that vaccines will cause bees to be autistic?  Apparently gorillas are just a big hoax.  Huh.  Dinosaurs are a myth, guys.  Another flurfer laughs at good science.  Oh, and apparently I failed in my red pill philosophy debate.  And of course a deer makes an observation about how I'm just a depressed fat guy.  So if any of these dumbass comments strikes your fancy, then please stay tuned.  Oh shit, but first, guess what we got?  Today I Learned!  So first up on Today I Learned... All male anglerfish will starve to death as virgins if they do not find and bite the belly of a female, where they will remain permanently attached, nourished by her blood, and breathing through their own gills, their eyes and fins atrophy away, and they must provide sperm on demand.  Damn.  That sounds like a harsh life to live, but, I mean, apparently they're fine with it.  I don't know if I would want to have, like, an incel permanently attached to my tummy, like, the entire time.  Like, I don't know.  Like, I don't think that would be something that I would want.  I mean, they would remain permanently virgins otherwise.  I think that if I was in the anglerfish's position, I'd be like, you know what?  I don't fucking need to have sex.  Yeah.  no siree i am not some sperm pump.  okay there bitch i would evolve myself out of that goddamn situation.  next on today i learned that in eighteen ninety five u k prime minister william gladstone founded a public library.  Aged 85, he wheelbarrowed his personal collection of 32,000 books the three-quarters mile between his home and the library.  His desire, his daughter said, was to bring together books who had no readers with readers who had no books.  And I have to say, that is, I mean, that was awesome.  I mean, you're 85 and you wheelbarrowed all of those fucking books, the three quarters of a mile to the public library you founded.  I mean, that's fucking dedication to that particular mindset right there.  So I just want a round of applause for you, good sir.  And finally, on Today I Learned, that heart transplant recipients often report changes in temperament or aesthetic tastes which parallel traits of their donor, going as far as pursuing the same hobbies as and adopting the donor's musical tastes.  So, I mean, that's kind of interesting because it brings into question, like, how much is transferred whenever you, you know, donate an organ?  Would some of your personality actually physically live on in another person?  And, you know, I think that more research into why this happens is needed, but it's very curious that it does happen.  Oh, so that's it for today.  I learned y'all ready to fuck some shit up, though.  Y'all know what time it is, though.  Shitty-ass science!  We're gonna answer some science.  shit really wrong!  all right what do we got today?  is this how they make chemtrails?  it's a l'oreal bottle that says locket weather control hairspray okay.  so yes this is exactly what is on the planes.  they just have these big fucking tanks of l'oreal.  l'oreal if you don't know is probably owned by monsanto.  it doesn't matter if it really is or not they definitely are owned by monsanto.  monsanto.  What they do is they put all of this shit into these products to make you think that it's not really a thing.  But they've really got L'Oreal tanks that are invisible.  That's important, okay?  Because when you're on a plane, you can't see the tanks.  But they're invisible, and they are on the plane.  As they are, they're positioned directly above the engines, too.  So whenever they're up in the air, it's actually L'Oreal Locket Weather Control Hairspray that's pumping out the back, and that's the actual chemtrails.  You look at the ingredients on that, again, doesn't matter if it's really there or not, but if you look at the ingredients, it's got aluminum.  minute and it's got all these other chemicals in it and they're gonna control the weather and mind control us and make us eat up all this corporate american shit.  and oh fuck we have broken the case wide on this motherfucker.  tear down l'oreal.  burn all of your hair supplies made by any hair manufacturer because again doesn't matter if they're in catch with monsanto they are definitely products of monsanto.  okay okay honey okay all right.  Yeah, you know, I have to say it's rather fun playing like a crazed conspiracy theorist.  Yeah, I can imagine it is entertaining for all you guys out there, especially Casey sitting in the living room right now.  Just throwing away like any need for actual evidence and just being like, oh, it doesn't matter what the fuck.  It actually says there are invisible L'Oreal canisters on the backsides of all the airplanes that... spray out chemtrails, and try to manipulate us into drinking the fluoride waters.  Like, it doesn't really matter what you say.  It can be the craziest shit on Earth, and it would be valid under the conspiracy theorist, like, idea.  So, I don't know.  It's fun.  Anyways, y'all ready for some comments?  Yeah!  Prepare to facepalm yourself in the next week.  All right, so there's a link here that says the first ever insect vaccine is designed to protect bees from devastating diseases.  Oh, okay.  That sounds like a pretty smart idea.  But then, of course, you got the Vantivexor coming in to fuck everyone's day up.  That's why we need a bunch of autistic bees.  Actually, microblogginism on Twitter actually recently put out this like meta analysis of all of the studies and everything like that, that actually shows that there's no physical link between vaccines and autism.  Still, I do.  don't know why like bees having autism would matter to this individual like just what we need autistic fucking bees.  well what do you think the autistic bees are gonna do?  just insanely pollinate an area and focus on that single area like?  i don't understand why you would be like.  like Even if it were, even if there were a link, why would that even matter to you?  If there are two, like, I don't even know how you engage autism and bees.  Oh, so next, next we have the gorilla denialist.  Honey, did you know that there are people out there that deny gorillas are real?  They have an answer for that.  Because there's a YouTube video that says instinct gorilla suit test behind the scenes, right?  And they get these gorilla suits where people get into the gorilla suits and they can act just like a gorilla, you know, because they're actors or whatnot.  But this person posted that video and said, this is how they've been making monkey and zoos research gorillas, hoax, koala, toucan, polar bear, orangutan.  I am on the chase.  Join me.  What's orangutan eyes?  Orangutan!  Watch that orangutan.  The orangutan eyes are fake too.  Orangutan!  Orangutan!  I don't know.  It's weird.  He fucked up his spelling, but I mean, that's kind of expected.  Oh, here's kind of, it seems long, but I don't think it actually is because it's kind of, it's screen capped on a phone.  So Michael here says, Malcolm Daniel, dinosaurs are a myth, a daydreamer's dream.  These experiments.  Experts as you call them haven't found a complete skeleton, only few bones at best and their imagination kicks in.  We still have living on this earth some creatures that people fantasize as being extinct, such as mastodon which equals an elephant, sabertooth tiger equals a walrus.  velociraptor equals a kangaroo brontosaurus is equal to a giraffe etc.  etc.  fantasies of dirt diggers is all they are.  that's all and they can't prove that this creature could actually fly.  try it yourself with a couple of sheets of paneling and jump off of a cliff.  if you dare to i'll be.  uh i'll be.  you'll be the next one on the extinct list.  so species go extinct, single persons do not go extinct.  Like, I don't know, like a person can die or whatnot, but if a species goes extinct, that means there are no more living creatures of that particular species in which to propagate the species.  So, it's just, it's, that's not what extinct means, but also, you think that a mastodon is an elephant and a saber-toothed tiger is a walrus?  What the fuck?  Why the fuck are you so stupid?  I'm being genuine when I ask this, because it's legitimately concerning why you think a brontosaurus is a giraffe.  Letting Muslims run for government office now shows how corrupt the Democratic Party is.  All you fucking Muslims out there want to be treated as equals in America?  You couldn't tell that last part was sarcastic.  So this particular redneck dumbass idiot right here thinks that you shouldn't allow Muslims to run for government office.  And I think that's pretty bullshit.  Doesn't matter what religion you are, you should be able to run for office.  They want to control it.  so it's only Christians that are in office, though.  They even pull this shit with atheists.  But basically, anybody that's not a Christian, they will always have a problem with running for office.  And no, it's not about how corrupt the Democratic Party is.  They're just adhering to the Constitution, something that you and your president can't even make it through the Fourth Amendment on.  earth is a stationary plane 2019 and we don't have any real pictures of the insanely spinning rock.  stop being silly with all the math theories and 500 year old experiments.  laughable i like how he says laughable instead of actually laughing like i don't know.  that just seems weird like haha that's laughable It's like, then fucking laugh.  So, no, the Earth is not a stationary plane.  Bob from Globusters, he proved that it's not a stationary plane.  You know, last week, actually, what was it, Simon Dan, he posted up his review of the Behind the Curve documentary.  You know, you can look at my review of it, and I point out some of the same things that Simon Dan did, but both of them offer, both videos offer their own perspective of the situation.  But yeah, silly with all the math, like math explains our reality.  So I don't understand what you mean by all the silly math.  Math ends up working out because everything in the universe seems to operate under mathematical principles.  One plus one is always going to equal two.  There's no weird universe where it's going to equal three or potato or banana.  Yes, honey, bananas are delicious.  You know, we do have real pictures of the Earth, but I know that even if I flashed, like, a picture of it here, or even a video, like a live feed from it here, of it here, you would still not accept that, because you have an unfalsifiable narrative.  Gee, you simply fail to acknowledge what has been said to you and assert what you think that Red Pill said.  You were doing the very same thing you say the other side does.  So I didn't really find myself doing the same thing that the other side does.  I found myself trying to understand Red Pill philosophy's position.  And so I would restate it towards him to make sure that I understood him correctly because I didn't want to misrepresent him.  Now, if you guys see that as being bad or heinous in some kind of way that I'm trying to legitimately understand what he's saying, then there's nothing I can do for you, okay?  You're just, I mean, obviously you're a lost cause, but whatever.  This feels like it's just for views now.  He's getting old.  Or it's getting stale.  Sorry, I don't know what the fuck I was reading.  So I can understand how it's starting to feel a little stale, the whole flat earth thing.  But I feel like, you know, I'm still finding different ways in which to combat the flat earth ideas.  And, you know, the flat earthers are still coming up with these weird, crazy, harebrained ideas that they think disproves the globe.  So.  I can understand you feeling like it's getting stale or something, but at the same time, we have to be consistent and persistent with our debunking of this bad idea.  Because the only way that bad ideas are going to be combated, crushed, or killed is by actually combating them consistently.  Funny thing is, if you do the test and say that it proves the Earth is spinning, he would just say he didn't do the test, therefore it's flat.  Yeah, I agree.  Pretty much any flat earther out there will deny every bit of evidence that you give them and go with their unfalsifiable narrative.  Because, I mean, that's what they do.  They go with their unfalsifiable narrative, even in the face of... This is part of cognitive dissonance in which they use confirmation bias to go with their already unfalsifiable narrative.  And there's no way that you can get around that.  I mean, they have to be the ones to realize it for themselves, so the best that you can do is continue to tell them how wrong they are, but most importantly, why they are wrong.  Hey!  I'm a depressed fat guy.  So yeah, apparently me responding to this Schroeder, I think is what his name was.  This guy's video about proving God scientifically in five minutes.  Apparently that means that I'm a depressed fat guy.  Like I didn't really seem depressed video.  I think I was very clear and cogent in my points.  So yeah, I don't know.  I can only I can only surmise that people think that I'm depressed just because I'm shitting on another person's idea.  But I invite everybody to shit on even my idea.  Every idea can be shit upon.  Oh, and the whole fat guy thing.  I don't know.  It's just it's really unimpressive at this point.  Anytime anybody calls me fat, I'm just like, oh, yeah.  So I'm fat.  What the fuck ever doesn't mean I'm wrong.  So come up with something better.  the freemasons are so much better than the expensive masons.  thank you david emery.  i appreciate that you're right.  freemasons are better than expensive ones.  you are fat.  thanks Michael Bell for stating the obvious.  I don't know why you feel the need to shit on another person personally.  in this particular conversation M Ben's indoctrinating his kids I feel like is an act that needs to be shit upon.  but you're just like fuck this guy.  he flips through his book.  oh yeah you're fat.  and then finally we have somebody talking in support of stephen anderson and flat earth.  maybe i'm not sure you decide.  pastor anderson is correct when he says atheists and fayers have biblical evidence for flat earth.  fact is hundreds of thousands possibly millions of atheists have become born again through flat earth.  it's a fact that piss warm christians like anderson.  hey you should do some research into the fe movement because a lot of people do and if you're not up to speed when they visit your channel they will be more convinced of the global eye.  wait wait a second.  So you think that I'm a pro-flat Earth channel and not a pro-globe channel?  Like, you watched this video, I'm assuming, and you came away with the idea that I'm against the globe model or the actual spherical Earth?  I don't know.  Tell me what you think in the comments below, because I'm not exactly sure.  But what I do appreciate is the fact that you think that I could convince a flat earther of the quote unquote globe lie, because that's just actual science that you want to paint as a lie.  So anyways, I would really love to know what all of you heathens think about this comment in the comments down below.  Well, that's it for today, heathens.  I am so glad you guys made it to the end.  If you will, go down below, leave me your thoughts on either that last comment or any comment that we have discussed here.  While you're down there, make sure you smash that like button and subscribe if you like this kind of dumbass content.  Don't forget to stand up and use your voice, and I will see you heathens later.
