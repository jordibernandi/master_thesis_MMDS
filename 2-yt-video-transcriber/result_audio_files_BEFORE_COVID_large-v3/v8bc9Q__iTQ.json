And while he had an issue with that because he was actually going to wait there for his friend because he actually live in a building itself.  he wouldn't let him in.  So he decides to call nine one one.  Now when, how many times have we seen this out of San Francisco?  Uh, someone calling now one on a black person for nothing at all.

The girl that was, like, told he's married.  Wow.  You know that's illegal now, right?  510-407-0222.  Yeah, that's illegal to call cops on African-Americans.  He said he's waiting for a friend, and I asked him to dial on the call box, and he said he would not.  So I have no way to know if his friend is actually here.  Yeah, so I'm here to just rob whatever.  What, a mailbox?  I'm just asking you for your friend's name.  I don't give a fuck.  I don't have to tell you shit.  Can you hear him?  Yeah, he can hear me.

He didn't listen to his son at all.  now this guy is silly.  this guy went to princeton university ivy league school and you still didn't learn anything.  you didn't see the hundreds and hundreds of videos of people doing the exact same thing which you doing now and getting fired from their jobs or can't do things in business anymore.  i mean you didn't see any of that.  i mean you work at youtube.  you work in device partnerships.  You work with YouTube TV as well, that division.  Surely you've seen some of those videos on YouTube.  You work for them.  Are you still going to do it?  You put your YouTube job on the line?  And for what?  You got a kid.  You got to provide for your son.  Why would you do that?  if anything you should have hung up that phone.  so you know what ma'am you know i know i figured out i'm wrong you know.  no i apologize to the man.  it would have been an issue but no you didn't want to do that.  you wanted to raise your profile and his brother stated that's happened to him many times before now.  this brother also used to work at facebook.  so this brother you know like say he had decent jobs at decent companies.  well see let me tell you what it is.  All this pull yourself up by your bootstrap is the biggest lie they ever told you because of a black man actually gets some boots.  for first of all, for the black man and woman don't have boots cause they made sure to take that away with the wealth gap.  So you managed to get you some boots, managed to get you some strings to pull yourself up by your bootstraps.  Then you get the job right?  And then they're mad and giving you problems because you work in the job.  You earned it.  And trust me, black Americans have to earn their degrees because we don't have hookups to pay for SAT scores or hookups to pay for our grades.  So they get good.  No black Americans have to earn everything they have.  So I would trust a brother that's a software engineer because I know he had to earn it.  And because you didn't want to see a brother living in those areas, he had to deal with those issues of racial profiling.  Understand?  But one thing I will say, now you look stupid, Chris.  You look stupid.  because you didn't listen to your little son.  He told you he didn't like it.  He, your son even say, I told you didn't listen to your son and now you got your job in jeopardy.  Nine times out of 10, the way things usually go, people get fired.  News outlets are sitting up here calling YouTube about you.  Do you think they're going to keep you around you being that big of a liability?  They don't want that on them.  They got enough issues going on at YouTube calling 911 on a black man for another thing.  It's like they don't care about their families.  They don't care about messing up their jobs.  It doesn't matter at that point.  It's just, I see a black person, I gotta get at them.  And every single time it happens.  And that's why these people wanna say, They got a high IQ.  That's why I say no.  Yeah, you're high like you.  That's what I say.  Because ain't no way you can keep seeing the exact same thing happen and you keep doing it.  It doesn't make sense.  I mean, brothers and sisters, think about that for a minute.  If we kept doing something over and over and over and over, usually somebody say, dude, you want to stop doing that already?  No, they're going to do it because you know what?  It's see red.  when they see a black man or woman be successful because it is goes around.  their little propaganda about us for one.  They think that we should be at the bottom, so when they see us walking around and living in nice condos and luxury homes and they see a brother or sister drive up in an expensive Mercedes Benz or some Audi or maybe they have whatever kind of car they have that's expensive, they're like, they looking double take.  How he afford that?  How she afford that?  Where they work at?  They want to start approaching, hi, how you doing?  Uh, when you work, it was in your business trying to figure out how about your money pocket watching a black man or woman.  But Chris, you expose yourself.  Now you work in device partnerships, but a lot of people at first was like, what part of YouTube he work in?  He work in a, well he's taking down videos.  cause you know, a lot of people like looking at that.  because people like Chris, you know, they up there tuna.  They are.  this guy harbored racist views to black people.  I'm going to call a cop or a black man for no reason at all.  And he got exposed toward the end and didn't have any kind of decency to apologize at the end to the man for what he did.  because they don't apologize to black folk at all because they always think they're right and they feel like they have to apologize to us in law and themselves.  So, This guy is silly.  You went to Princeton university, didn't learn a thing.  But leave me a comment.  Let me know what you think about this particular story with this YouTube employee.  I think he personally needs to be fired.  He's a liability.  And you know, this guy here, I mean, I wouldn't trust him over anything because you know, if he feels that he needs to call the police on a black man, even this black man telling you multiple times, he's going to delete the video.  Just stop doing what you're doing and you still do it.  No, my opinion.  You need to be fine. ",
