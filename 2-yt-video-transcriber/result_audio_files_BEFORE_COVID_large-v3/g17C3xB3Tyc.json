            "text": "Hey everybody, welcome back to Guns and Gadgets, your source for Second Amendment news.  It's Monday, you know what that means, Monday Morning Grind, brought to you by Blackout Coffee.  Don't forget to buy 2A or 1776 when you buy that coffee, it directly helps this channel as well as this company who stands by us and the Second Amendment.  Your support for both has been astonishing.  We thank you both.  And don't forget, use hashtag Team 2A Coffee with your selfies with these two bags of coffee, 2A or 1776, and you can win free coffee as well.  Check my social media posts for that.  But what I wanted to talk about today is Walmart.  I did that video the other day, and you can see it floating above my head here about Walmart and their new anti-gun and anti-ammunition craze that they just came out of nowhere with.  And I wanted to find the reason why.  Because we know what happened.  I even read the internal memo in that video.  But it's been bugging me.  Why?  Why would a company that was once sold as true Americana, how did they get from there to where they are today?  I found the answer.  I was digging through some stuff and I fell across some of Walmart's policies.  If you really want to read it yourself, I'll put a link in the description.  It is the Walmart corporate policy section on their corporate website.  Walmart came out and made these announcements on September 4th.  The policy was updated September 3rd.  So they knew, you know, obviously they knew what they were doing in advance of the announcement.  But I want to read you a snippet, just one line from this policy, and that tells you everything you need to know.  See, Walmart has made a deal with the devil.  Many people will say that happened a long time ago when they became so big.  But on the firearm side, the literal antichrist of firearms, the literal... anti-freedom guy in the country.  And his name is none other than, wait for it, Michael Bloomberg.  So I'm actually reading from their policies right here on my iPad.  And if you scroll down or wherever you are, if you go down to their firearms and ammunition guidelines, it goes through all of the changes they just made.  And there's this one line that you have to actually look for to see, but it says that Walmart is a charter member of the Responsible Firearms Retailer Partnership organized by Walmart and Everytown for Gun Safety.  Now, unless you live under a rock, Everytown for Gun Safety is a conglomerate of mayors against gun violence and Moms Demand Action.  They joined and it's founded and funded by Michael Bloomberg and he is the guy who is spending his own millions to do things such as the red flag law.  He was the one who birthed it in every single state and paid money.  In fact If you live in Massachusetts, there's stuff that can prove that our own Republican governor, he's Rhino, Charlie Baker, took money from Michael Bloomberg.  All right, so this guy is in everybody's pockets and that's why they're doing his bidding.  Now Bloomberg also supports, through Everytown for Gun Safety, things like assault weapon bans and magazine bans.  And this guy is looking to ban everything.  Why would somebody want to disarm the law-abiding citizens?  We all know the answer to that.  But in their own policies, Walmart in black and white is telling everybody we are now in partnership with the biggest gun control fanatic there is in the land, Michael Bloomberg.  So now, maybe it's easier to swallow now that I know the truth.  Maybe.  But I figured I'd let you guys know the truth.  The real reason Walmart flipped the switch is because they got into bed with the devil himself.  And you know he paid him off somehow.  Now today is Monday.  It is the day that Congress is back to work.  I have my ears pinned to all of the channels in which I get some information funneled to me to see what is going on today.  Hopefully, I will be able to bring you that as soon as possible.  But today is the day, and because of that, make sure you drink a lot of coffee because you're going to need it.  Because some of the stuff coming down is going to be ridiculous.  Again, thank you all for your support of this channel.  It means so much to me.  I just, it's amazing and humbling, and I thank you.  Please remember that helping out Blackout Coffee and their time of struggle directly helps this channel as well.  And you can win some free coffee, flavor of your choice, doesn't even have to be one of mine.  But use a selfie on Instagram, Facebook, or Twitter.  Use hashtag Team2ACoffee and tag Guns N' Gadgets and Blackout Coffee.  It's pretty easy.  Share it with your friends.  Tag them in it too.  Because we're going to give away a lot of free coffee.  Because we thank you.  So until we see each other again, please be safe.  Stay vigilant.  Subscribe to this channel if you haven't already.  And carry a weapon.  Take care, everybody. ",
