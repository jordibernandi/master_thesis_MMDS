            "text": "Good afternoon everyone.  The strongest summer jet streams to hit the Pacific Northwest ever.  That black dot is where the winds are comparatively to where they usually are during the summer, bringing us summer snow of almost a foot in parts of Canada.  Proceeding of this front 100 mile per hour straight line winds, electrical ferocity now heading over the Great Lakes.  Asia, typhoons heading north-south.  That's incredibly rare.  David Birch talked about zonal wind temperatures being anomalous last month.  And as the magnetic field of our planet continues to weaken along with the intensification of the grand solar minimum, our jet streams are going to continue to go further out of their flows.  I discussed this in Climate Revolution.  my new book, Understand, Prepare, Adapt, and Thrive During This Grand Solar Minimum.  The link's in the description box below as well as links to all of tonight's stories and images so you can do your own research.  Cliff Mass putting it down for us here, the strongest summer jet streams to hit the Pacific Northwest ever.  Wind speeds are so far above the normal that it has to be a news story.  Yet the mainstream media won't pick up on this because it's a cold weather news story.  So we can see how the intensification, here we are on the 19th, 20th, 21st.  It'll continue through this week until it alleviates, but that's 4,000 miles more that this jet needs to move before it stops its wind strength.  But moving through the 18th, 19th, and 20th, if you're in the Great Lakes, central  U.S.,  This is an intense front that's going to push through.  Electrical ferocity is definitely seen in this.  Ryan Maui pointing out 100 mile per hour straight line winds.  And you can see that's just at the edge there.  And look at the atmospheric disturbance.  Looks like a wisp or a wave, several waves off the backside of that storm.  Now, how is it moving?  You're getting that tail wisp as well.  Danger tornadoes, danger lightning, danger hail, danger wind.  This is exactly what they talked about in the Dalton Minimum.  Lewis and Clark, the explorers, as they traveled up in these same exact areas, talked about how these 100-mile-an-hour winds with giant hailstones would wipe out entire hamlets and the amount of destruction that they talked about in their encounters, in their writings.  This is exactly it, 2.0.  We're back into it.  Tyler Hamilton also talking about the 140-knot jet streams.  Again, noting that dot on the top is so far out of the norm.  It's actually, it seems like our seasons have flipped 180 degrees because this is the type of jet stream wind that you would get in the middle of winter as we're going into December, January.  Not in the middle of the year in summer in the northern hemisphere.  So rare that it's the all-time highest ever recorded for this time of the year.  And it just so happens.  the grand solar minimum is intensifying.  Our magnetic field is weakening.  And somehow they're still blaming it on CO2.  I just don't see where the fallout in science and the matching of possible causation skips a beat when it comes to talking about a global tax or the IPCC.  I just still don't get it.  The science is not settled.  We should be looking for other answers here.  Weather network even picking it up.  Astonishing winter-like jet streams threaten two provinces with July snow.  Yet all I see across the mainstream media is heat in the northeast, heat, it's going to be hot, it's going to be hot.  Well, it's summer.  We should be talking about July snows because it just doesn't happen.  It is so rare.  Even the weather forecasters are talking about how rare and unprecedented this event is, but all we're getting is heat stories.  You see how lopsided the mainstream media is?  July snows.  Never before in mid-July have they seen these types of events in the jet streams.  Yet all you're seeing is record heat, pay more global tax, stop CO2.  Seriously?  Snow in July?  How can this happen?  But look at the density on the peaks there, all the way from British Columbia heading into Alberta.  That darker gray that you see is 20 centimeters.  30 centimeters is the full foot for those of you in the  U.S.,  So they're talking anywhere from three to nine inches of accumulation where you see these colors.  But somehow this just didn't even make the newsfeed at all.  So coming in closer back to BC here, coastal mountain range and some of the Rocky Mountains continuing snow trend.  And over to David Burch.  He was also pointing out the anomalies near record low temperatures, cold in the pole based on the zonal mean temperatures.  wide that out for you here not at the 250 millibar but at the 10 millibar level up in the north pole.  again people are pointing this out but the mainstream media just is not picking it up.  that mean temperature was incredibly low at the last week of june heading into july.  Also other atmospheric anomalies, typhoons.  They don't normally go south to north in a straight line.  That is so unusual, the track of this.  Not only did it just dog leg, but it went straight north.  Usually they have some curvature in them, east to west, and then they bend and they have a U hook.  Rarely do you see a north-south typhoon.  Even the weather forecasters here, as this storm was passing, it was a tropical storm as it moved past Taiwan, were saying how strange it was that it's going just straight north and south.  And also, those of you who are into geoengineering, the same time that tropical storm was passing, it seemed there were two systems that were trying to combine into one.  But I want to point out those vertical clouds at the bottom there over Kilimanjaro, as well as off to the east of the Philippines.  Again, you just don't see straight line clouds like this that run for 800 miles.  What is going on with our atmosphere?  This is happening now.  It's going to intensify as we move through this grand solar minimum.  How prepared are you for emergencies?
