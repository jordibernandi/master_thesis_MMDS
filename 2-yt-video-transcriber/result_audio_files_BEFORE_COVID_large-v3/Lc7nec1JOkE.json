            "text": "So, if you need Christ to go to heaven, what happened to those who had no exposure to Christianity?  For example, the Native Americans in America as pro-Humans.  Okay, excellent question.  It's really a question, what about those that have never heard?  And that question comes up a lot, so let's take a look at it.  Now, notice that this question is a moral question.  It's kind of a way of saying that... Well, it would seem to be unfair of God to not provide an opportunity to be saved to everyone.  And so it's impugning God's morality.  But let's take a look at it.  First of all, Christ's sacrifice is necessary for salvation because, as Paul even says in Galatians chapter 2, if righteousness could be achieved by the law, then Christ died in vain.  Why is God sending an innocent human being to die?  if you could get to heaven any other way?  He wouldn't.  The reason that Christ's sacrifice is necessary is because an infinite being cannot allow sin to go unpunished.  And we're all sinners.  So he has to punish somebody else to remain just to allow us not to be punished.  In any event, so Christ's sacrifice is necessary for salvation.  In my first debate with Christopher Hitchens many years ago, all these debates are on our YouTube channel.  He said, well, why did God wait until just 2,000 years ago?  And I said, well, Christopher, Christ's sacrifice is retroactive.  In other words, the people who lived in Old Testament times, even though they didn't know the name of Christ, were still saved by his sacrifice.  Just by putting their trust in Yahweh, putting their trust in God.  Even though they didn't know the name.  We're looking back and we can know the name.  Anyway, everyone knows that God exists through nature and conscience.  So there's nobody out there who's never heard.  Everybody knows there's a God.  But not everybody knows there's Jesus.  So that's the second point.  Some say that those who don't know Jesus can be saved by Christ's sacrifice if they seek God.  Like the Old Testament saints, right?  They didn't know the name, but they still trusted God.  And Paul even says in Romans chapter 4 that the gospel was preached to Abraham, and Abraham was declared righteous by his faith, okay?  So some say that, yeah, you can be saved without knowing the name of Christ.  But I think the Bible makes it pretty clear you need to know the name of Christ.  The more biblically consistent view is that God will get true seekers to truth about Christ so they can be saved.  And an example of that is Cornelius in Acts chapter 10.  He's already a believer in Yahweh.  Why are we sending the Holy Spirit?  Why is God sending the Holy Spirit over there to convince him that Jesus rose from the dead?  If you can just be saved without knowing the name.  Now... The next point points out that we know that there are many people who hear the gospel and don't believe it, right?  It could be that those that never hear the gospel wouldn't have believed it anyway.  In fact, here's the point.  It could be that God has so ordered the world so that those who never hear the gospel wouldn't have believed it anyway.  Why am I saying that?  Because Acts chapter 17 seems to say that.  Paul is preaching to the Athenians, and here's what he says.  From one man God made every nation of men that they should inhabit the whole earth, and he determined the time set for them in the exact places where they should live.  God did this so that men would seek him and perhaps reach out for him and find him, though he is not far from every one of us.  In other words, God has so preordained the universe that those who don't hear the gospel wouldn't have believed it anyway, right?  That's what this could be saying.  Now, I don't know if this is the way God has done it.  I'm simply saying it's possible.  he's done it this way.  I know how people are saved, so we risk all to get them the gospel.  We know at the end of the day, nobody's ever going to be treated unfairly because God is just.  Right?  God wants everybody to be saved.  He wants everyone to be saved more than we do.  So if somebody can be saved, he's going to give them the information to be saved.  But if people who already have the light of nature turn away from that light... then God is under no obligation to get them any more light.  More light is just going to annoy them.  They're just trying to suppress the light they already have.  Let me just highlight this point by asking you guys a survey question.  I ask this of every audience I'm privileged to speak to now.  This is just for Christians in here.  If you're not a Christian, it's not for you.  But Christians, I want you to think of somebody right now whom you know is not a Christian.  A friend, a relative, somebody like that.  Everybody got somebody?  Everybody got somebody?  Okay.  Here is my question about the person you're thinking of.  Is the person you're thinking of on a relentless pursuit of truth?  They want to know if Christianity is true.  Or are they apathetic or maybe even hostile to Christianity?  How many people say the person I'm thinking of is on a relentless pursuit of truth?  They want to know.  I got two half hands.  Like, I don't know, maybe.  How many people say the person I'm thinking of is apathetic or hostile?  Yeah, look around the room.  It's the same everywhere I go.  It's 99 to 1.  Most people aren't interested in God.  Most people are not on a truth quest.  They're on a happiness quest.  And they're just going to believe whatever they think is going to make them happy.  And if they think God is going to get in their way of their happiness, well, so much for God.  I'm going with happiness.  What they don't realize is they're never going to achieve the contentment they want without God.  In fact, this is the question I ask people quite a bit on college campuses, and I think it's a question you can use with people who are not believers.  The question is this, if Christianity were true, would you become a Christian?  I've had atheists stand at that microphone right there in front of hundreds of people and say, no, no.  I thought you claimed to be reasonable.  How's that reasonable?  If something were true, would you believe it?  You say, no, it's not.  The problem isn't here.  The problem's here.  They don't want it to be true.  Now, what does this mean with relation to this question?  It means that most people out there aren't even searching for God.  So if God doesn't get them the gospel, it wouldn't have mattered anyway, even if he did.  They don't want them.  They want to go their own way.  They don't want there to be a God because they want to be God of their own lives.  Don't you half the time?  Admit it.  Being a Christian is inconvenient.  You'd rather do your own thing too, wouldn't you? ",
