In Ghana, and the first time at the beach.  So many people.  There are quite a lot of people here.  We paid 15 Ghana Cedis to get in.  so that's about 2.5 2.6 dollars about 2.6 dollars white reasonable.  yeah we do.  some beaches are as expensive as a thousand era.  i think a thousand era is even cheap.
