You're so quick to talk on Twitter, but you can't even answer a question, Alexandria.  Does it bother you that Linda Sarsour said that we shouldn't humanize the Jews, Alexandria?  What about justice for the Jews, Alexandria?  Do you care about the Jews?  Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib are jihadis.  And you, I guess you're a proud member of the Hamas caucus.  Linda Sarsour and Tamika Mallory, who you're friends with, are friends with Farrakhan, who called Jews termites.  How's that for justice, Alexandria?  How's that for justice?  What is your problem?  Why does she think that Jewish people are excluded from justice in this country?  Have fun being a Jew-hater, Alexandria!  Have fun, Jew-hater! ",
