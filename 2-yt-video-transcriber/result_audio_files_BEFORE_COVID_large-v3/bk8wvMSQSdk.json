It was too quick and not all accurate information, especially about the info about Reginald Vail Johnson, I had the wrong article up there, aside from the information about him was correct.  It was also incomplete and needed more information.  So with that being said, let's get started.  Now, as time went on, there was some information that got leaked about Darius McCrary and Jaleel White.  Now, before I go any further, watch this video from one of my favorite channels, Nicki Swift.

            "text": "Debuting in 1989, Family Matters was one of the definitive sitcoms of the 90s.  But all the pressures of making a hit show weighed on the actors, many of whom have experienced some major personal and professional problems.  Here's a look at the scandalous side of Family Matters.  Family Matters' most famous and valuable asset was, surprisingly enough, not originally part of the series.  Jaleel White's uber-nerd Steve Urkel didn't make his first appearance until halfway through season one.  He was just some dork who lived next door to the Winslows and came over to bug Laura, whom he had a big crush on.  But he was a big hit with audiences and network honchos alike.  ABC execs decided that they liked Urkel so much that they were going to make all future episodes about him.  The non-Urkel cast members went along with the plan, though the shift caused some tension.  White was aware that the situation got a bit dicey, as he told Vanity Fair in 2011, \"...things were definitely strained in the early going.  There's no sense in hiding that.  There was a division between myself and the rest of the cast, but over nine years and 215 episodes, obviously relationships get  better.\".  In the first four seasons of Family Matters, the Winslows had three kids.  The older two were Eddie and Laura, and then there was little Judy, played by Jamie Foxworth.  But then, after season four, Judy disappeared, never to be seen or even mentioned again.  Did Urkel erase her with one of his crazy gadgets?  According to Foxworth, the show's creative team wrote off Judy because they didn't want her around anymore.  In 2017, she told The Root... The producers felt that they could do it and no one would notice.  They'd done it with previous shows they had.  They figured no one would really care.  My fans took notice of it.  They figured they could just throw me away, no explanation at all.  Some of my cast members knew before I did.  Her TV mom, Jo Marie Payton, tried to change producers' minds about the decision, but to no avail.  In 2014, Darius McCrary, forever known as Eddie Winslow, got engaged to Tammy Bronner of the Harlem Globetrotters.  But by 2017, the marriage was falling apart, and it was reportedly ending in a frightening way.  In February of that year, Bronner received a restraining order against McCrary after alleging multiple counts of abuse against her and their infant daughter.  Bronner reported that McCrary's excessive drinking and drug use made him violent, and that he not only struck her, but also held his daughter over a pot of boiling water while screaming about how he wished she'd never been born.  Bronner also claimed there was another time when McCrary flew into a rage and threw picture frames around the house, just barely missing hitting anyone.  McCrary was ordered to move out of the family home and stay 100 yards away from his wife and daughter.  In response, his attorney told E!  News, Tammy Bronner is no victim.  She is a predator motivated by a desperate desire to extort money out of Mr.  McCrary while trying to create an advantage in an impending divorce and custody battle.  Two weeks after a judge granted Bronner a restraining order against McCrary, he got another one against her.  McCrary claimed in legal documents obtained by TMZ that Bronner had violent tendencies, alleging that she threw a hot iron at him, leaving a second-degree burn on his chest.  A few weeks after the courts ordered these two to avoid each other, Bronner filed for divorce.  Citing irreconcilable differences, she asked that McCrary be blocked from seeing their daughter until he sought treatment for substance abuse and attended domestic abuse intervention sessions.  In February 2019, the couple reached a divorce settlement.  Bronner received legal and physical custody of their daughter, with weekly visits for McCrary.  Additionally, the court ordered McCrary to attend parenting classes and to seek help for his problems with alcohol, drugs, and violence.  This is all sadly ironic, considering that McCrary once founded Father's Care, an organization that seeks to help men become better and more conscientious fathers.  Darius McCrary isn't the only Family Matters star who's been dogged by abuse allegations.  In 2012, Bridget Hardy, Jaleel White's former girlfriend and the mother of his daughter, told Star magazine that two years earlier, their relationship came undone after White turned violent.  After finding evidence of infidelity on his phone, she confronted him about it, and she claimed that he then struck her across the chest area and pushed her into a toilet.  Hardy got out of the house and took her daughter with her on a planned out-of-town trip.  When they returned, White had changed the locks on the house and placed all of her possessions in a storage facility.  When Hardy went public with her story, White waved away the allegations.  He said in a statement, When you're doing well in life, it's par for the course.  certain individuals will try and knock you down.  When the individual is also the mother of your only child, it is particularly hurtful.  White further claimed to People magazine that Hardy made her comments to get an upper hand in child custody negotiations between the two. ",

            "text": "So you see, there were secrets behind the scenes, but I have more to tell you.  Did you all know that Jahliel White and Michelle Thomas were in a bit of a scandal and that was one of the reasons she became in the intro lineup instead of Cherie Johnson?  also known as Maxine Waters, who had been on the show since I believe the second season all the way to the last season.  That caused a rift between Michelle and Cherie behind the scenes, but with Michelle coming from the iconic Bill Cosby show that gave her somewhat seniority over Cherie, well, a good recommendation anyway.  You know what, since we're talking about the late and beautiful Michelle Thomas, let's learn a little bit about the beauty.  Well, Michelle D. Thomas was born on September 23, 1968, in Brookline, Massachusetts, but grew up in Montclair, New Jersey, to Dennis Thomas, who was a member of the group Kool & Gang, believe it or not.  Her mother, Funjar Thomas, may have mispronounced her first name, was a stage actress.  She was crowned Miss Talented Teen in Hal Jackson, Talented Teen Pageant, and crowned International Queen in the International Competition in Matango Bay, Jamaica.  Oh, yes.  She also graduated in 1987 from Essex High School.  Later, she landed the role as Justine Phillips on The Cosby Show.  While on the show, she dated Malcolm Jamal Warner, a.k.a.  Theo.  Did you guys know that?  It was even told that he helped her get that role on The Cosby Show and also many other characters in TV shows as well.  Mm-hmm.  Hey, I have to stop for just one second.  I want you all to know that it doesn't stop here.  I have a lot of neat things going on.  Did you all know I have three other channels?  The one being my sister's channel.  Oh, yes.  I have The Truth Show, as you all should know.  Keisha's Gossip and Truth.  The Truth Show Deluxe and my sister's Top Tea and Five or Six.  And that's not all.  You can visit my website at thetruthshow.co.  This website gives you inside information and more.  Or become a patron for only $2.

Oh, I'm still not done yet.  If you like my videos and you want me to make you one, whatever it may be, well visit Freezing Moments in Time website and submit your request and we can talk, honey.  Everything is below.  And now let's get such.  as you all know family matters.  she also appeared in many music videos as well.  aside from that her death did come as a surprise because she led a pretty healthy lifestyle.  she was a vegan and she never smoked or drank alcohol.  then suddenly in august of 1997 she got diagnosed with a rare form of stomach cancer intra-abdominal dysmoplastic Small round cell tumor.  You see, this small plastic small round cell tumor, aka DSRCT, is an aggressive and rare cancer that primarily occurs as masses in the abdomen.  She did undergo surgery to remove a lemon-sized tumor shortly before landing her the role on the Young and the Restless in spring of 1998 and exiting Family Matters in that same year.  However, later another one grew and she got the cancerous growth removed, but it ruptured.  So after being released from the hospital and knowing she only had months to live, she flew back home to New Jersey to spend time with her family on Thanksgiving.  And she then died three days before Christmas, surrounded by her family and friends.  And yes, that included Malcolm Jamal Warner.  He was by her side.  until the end at Manhattan Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.  Then per her request, a Muslim funeral service was held for her in Montclair, New Jersey, where she got buried.  okay now let's talk about the scandals behind the scenes.  okay as i was saying michelle and cherie had beep.  cherie felt that michelle got it easy because of her relationship with malcolm and her charming jaleel white behind the scenes aside for her recommendations from bill cosby and the directors of the cosby show who played golf with directors of the family matter show.  oh yes You see, that's how she landed that role and ended up in the freaking intro.  I mean, goodness, the girl was in her 20s playing the love interest to Jalil White, who was in his teens at the time.  I mean, they were paying Jalil White $100,000 an episode.  that it got increased as the seasons got renewed.  did you all know that?  oh yes he said it out of his own mouth.  aside for that everyone on the cast wonder why they put michelle in the intro instead of cherie.  but hey michelle was beautiful and she knew it and she used that and not to mention her body one body part in particular.  hence how they kept describing her in the tv series Heck, and on top of that, they put beginning actor Sean Harrison, aka Waldo, in the intro as well instead of Cherie.  Cherie didn't want to ruffle feathers, especially after the brutal way they treated Jamie Foxxworth.  Hell, after that, everyone who could be quickly replaced was on their games.  You know, they were on top of their games.  Oh, and now that we're on that subject, have you all wondered why Jaleel White is still single?  and why some of the cast members and other movie stars don't really like him too much.  Well, you all have to understand, Jaleel White is the only child, and aside from him being a good actor, he's kind of conceited and egotistical.  Now, this is what they're saying.  I'm not saying that's what he is, but I'm just saying that's what they're saying.  It was rumored that it's hard to talk to him.  He's so set in his ways that pretty much take a really strong woman to deal with him and all his personality traits.  So those rumors of him and his baby mother and whatever, they were correct.  Maybe not to that extinct though, but they did have a fight and he did push her.  Oh, and the story about Darius McCreary, It's so freaking true.  He was using drugs at the time and rumored to still be using it.  Heck, it was secretly reported that he was high during one of their recent reunions together.  I mean, my goodness. ",
