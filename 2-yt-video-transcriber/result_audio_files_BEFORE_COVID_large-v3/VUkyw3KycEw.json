I'm going to meet Laurie before then.  I also need to do something at Oxford City again, and then I'll go meet her at Oxfordia.  I think that's around Oxfordia, so drive with me.  Let's go.  Let's go and drive to Oxfordia.  And she told me there's something very interesting coming up today.  So I'm all excited to go see.  Guys, so I'm sitting inside this church here and there's something so different about this church.  We are heading to a place, an area around the airport where the conductor I've been trying to get passengers to come.  I've been sitting here for like five minutes and nobody has said anything.  Everybody is quiet.  This is so different.  If you're in Lagos, Nigeria right now, the passengers, without the conductor and the driver telling them to move these boats, they'll get passengers to come here.  This is so insufficient.  Everybody is quiet.  My Nigerian side is not great because I used to be Christian as a child and many Christian schools began in Accra.  Benefit from traveling, right?  Guys, so I'm at Wache Festival.  We just left the planting festival to Wache Festival.  Guys, it's all about festivals of food in Accra, Ghana.  I guess this is sponsored by Maggi, as you can see.  So let's go in and have a taste of Wache and I'll be tasting it for the first time.  It's a lot of people here.  We have Maggi.  Guys, so this is how it looks like in here at Wache Festival.

So you have these lids, but they're still... You have white glass lids.  Yes.  You have white glass lids in place of black lids.  And it's really dope.  Wow.  Much more better than 50 minutes.  Yes.
