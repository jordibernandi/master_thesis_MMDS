He is a criminal defense attorney in Chicago who has been writing about the Epstein case at the Chicago Reader.  Welcome, Leonard.  Last time we spoke to you was before Epstein's death.  Since then, so much to get to.  What stands out to you about how he died? ",

            "text": "Well, I mean, I think what stands out to me is his lawyers think he was murdered.  There are certainly suspicious circumstances.  There was another incident that was not completely looked into.  that was apparently an assault on his life.  And the other thing that's interesting is that apparently the video camera was not functioning outside of his cell, which obviously would have provided some important information.  So, you know, I think a lot of people are rightly concerned.  And this is one of the things that, you know, the press has looked at is some of the problems that went on in the MCC.  I think, you know, I think what I like to do is look at the known facts here, which are that, you know, this, he was investigated back in 2005.  They raided his Palm Beach home back then.  They had all this evidence.  They had identified 36 underage victims of sex trafficking.  They apparently had found hidden cameras in his Palm Beach home suggesting that there was some sort of sexual blackmail operation that he was operating.  A 53-page indictment was prepared back then.  The investigation ends with this unusual non-prosecution agreement that grants, not only did the feds decide not to prosecute Epstein, but they grant immunity to all of his potential co-conspirators, which is something that I've never seen in a non-prosecution agreement.  The other thing is it's kept secret from his victims, which was apparently illegal.  Then this winter, there's this blockbuster series of articles embarrassing the federal government in the Miami Herald.  And in response to that, the feds bring the exact same indictment, practically.  If you look at the new indictment that was brought, it's basically the same.  It alleges sex trafficking between 2002 and 2005 involving underage girls.  So, you know, it's the same case, except what happens this time is that the feds tell the federal judge that this man is a danger to the community and needs to be detained at the MCC.  The federal judge listens to the prosecutors and he ends up dead in a very short order.  That's the first thing.  I think the second thing is to look at, you know, the federal prosecutor down in Florida's comments and sort of the unusual discrepancy between what he said in private and what he said in public.  That was Alexander Acosta, who was the U.S.  attorney down in Florida.  And in private, he told the Trump team reportedly that he was told to back off.  He was told to back off because this guy was above my pay grade and he was with intelligence.  in public, he's made very different comments.  He said, well, we thought it was a good deal at the time.  Now we know a lot more about Epstein.  A lot more information has come out.  This is clearly a lie.  There's nothing new that they've learned.  The new federal indictment is exactly the same as the other one.  I think the third important thing is that there is a damning, apparently damning video evidence that they've recovered.  I'm sure that they had quite a bit back in 2005, but now it's been reported that they obtained video and damning sexual videos from his safe in his Manhattan mansion.  So I think the one thing to consider is if this case did go to trial, what possible defense would he have?  Certainly, if I was his lawyer, you'd have to look at the public authority defense, which is that I was authorized to do these crimes because I was working with law enforcement.  I mean, the typical case that you see is, you know, somebody gets caught with five kilos of cocaine and they say, no, I'm authorized to do this.  Call my handler at the DEA.  Call Agent Johnson.  Here's his phone number.  He'll tell you that I'm working with him.  You know, you might remember the Whitey Bulger case.  where Whitey Bulger was committing extortion and murder while he was acting as an FBI informant.  It caused a huge scandal.  This would be far worse because assuming he's working with intelligence, he is victimizing children as part of this scheme.  And it would probably cause incredible public uproar, a huge, massive scandal, and probably something equal to the Church Commission back in the 70s, where there were significant reforms of U.S.  intelligence, including the CIA, NSA, and FBI.  So those are the known facts. ",

            "text": "Right.  In terms of this prospect of him working with intelligence, as Alexander Acosta reportedly said that Epstein was, there have been theories that, in fact, Epstein was working with Israeli intelligence, the Mossad.  I've seen no concrete evidence for it, but there is the fact that his lieutenant, this woman Ghislaine Maxwell, her father worked with the Mossad, and she herself was recently caught on camera in what appears to be a staged photograph at an In-N-Out burger in Los Angeles reading a book called The Book of Honor, The Secret Lives and Deaths of CIA Operatives.  So something strange is going on here. ",

            "text": "Truth is stranger than fiction sometimes, you know.  It is certainly an amazing clue that you would think somebody would look into.  And in terms of working with the Mossad, I certainly have read those reports.  You know, one of Epstein's possible marks was Ehud Barak, the former Prime Minister of Israel, a political rival of Netanyahu.  And there's been stories and I think in the Jerusalem Post, photographs of Barak going into Epstein's New York mansion at a time when there were underage girls there.  So Yeah, I mean, I've seen those reports.  Obviously, I don't know what intelligence he was working with.  The only thing I can say to that is that Mossad is not going to be able to tell Alexander Acosta, the US attorney down in Florida, to back off.  It would have had to have been US intelligence that would have had the authority to tell him to back off and to cut this guy loose.  He could have been working with Mossad, but clearly U.S.  intelligence had to have been involved. ",

            "text": "I would not put a lot of faith because it seems pretty clear from the facts as I've laid them out that there was high crimes by high officials and there just is no mechanism for the federal government to investigate itself.  It's not going to happen.  It never happens.  And, you know, there is some possibility that civil lawyers representing some of the victims that it's, you know, it's very sad.  And, you know, I read those reports of the victims, you know, urging the case to go forward.  But, you know, civil lawyers do have quite a bit of power to, you demand discovery and to demand justice.  And certainly if there were people besides Epstein that were involved, they can be brought in on civil cases.  So I hate to be such a cynic, but I don't see the Department of Justice aggressively pursuing the potential co-conspirators of Epstein and trying to get to the bottom of this.  Now, I hope I'm wrong.  And that there is, you know, yes, one of the people that was one of the criminals is dead, Epstein.  But there certainly were other people working with him.  And they were, you know, I guess the other reason why I'm so cynical is because they were all given immunity.  back in in 2007 in the non-prosecution agreement that they were, you know, the federal government gave immunity to all potential co-conspirators.  And that was an agreement that was apparently negotiated by You know, his lawyers, Alan Dershowitz and what's his name, the guy that investigated Clinton, the special counsel, Kent Starr.  So, yeah, again. ",
