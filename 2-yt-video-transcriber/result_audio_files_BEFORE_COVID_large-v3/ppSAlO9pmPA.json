If somebody is having thoughts, that is something that can be talked over by a mental health professional.  If somebody is having plans, that's something that should be addressed immediately.  That's something where you can go to any emergency room and you can walk in and let them know that the person that you're with is having thoughts about dying and making plans to die, and they will help you.  If you yourself are feeling suicidal, it's really important to know that help can come to you.  There are a few phone lines that you can text directly from your phone.  There's some LGBT specific phone lines like the Trevor Project.  And if you are now in a place where you're really thinking about help, you can reach out to therapists.  Psychology Today has a really good database and now there's even therapy online.  so that if you're not able to leave your home for mobility reasons or because your mood is so low that you're not feeling up to it, therapy can come to you.  It's about being open to reaching out.  It's about knowing that services can be free of charge, and we want to help.  We want to see you. ",
