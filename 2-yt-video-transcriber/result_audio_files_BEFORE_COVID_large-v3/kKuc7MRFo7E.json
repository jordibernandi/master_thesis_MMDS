I totally agree with you that the Cohn hearing was specifically planned to Stop the coverage and step on the president, what could be a huge success.  But, Mr.  Speaker, you're a historian.  You're a professor at heart.  And I'm telling everybody, remember this moment.  This is a tipping point.  You know, we've had a big build-up here.  Two years, Russia collusion, Russia collusion.  No evidence.  Then we have the new Green Deal.  No more planes, no more cows, no more combustion engine, no oil, no gas, and everything's free.  And it's $94 trillion, but don't worry about paying for it.  And a party of, you know, even abortion during labor.  And they wouldn't even stand up for infants born in a botched abortion that need medical help and are living independently.  What's happened to this party?  Where is this going to end?  Because I don't think this ends well for them at all. ",

I think the number of Democrats who got elected pretending to be moderate... who are now lining up on issue after issue as radicals.  I mean, when every single presidential candidate in the Senate voted that they would not protect babies, and as you point out, we're talking now about babies who have been born.  Senator Sasse's bill is about as clear and definitive as you could be, and every Democratic presidential candidate in the Senate voted for infanticide.  To me... That is such an extraordinary change.  And by the way, only about 15% of the country agrees with that.  So if we end up in an issue-oriented campaign next year, when you have case after case after case like this, I think they could be crushed in a way that we'll look back and be startled at how big the gap was.

I tweeted a little while ago, The idea that one of Hillary Clinton's closest friends helped write a vicious attack on President Trump by a man who has been convicted of lying leaves me a little bit unpersuaded that I should believe in Cohen.  I suspect that Lanny was one of the people who talked him into doing this, because he's a very smart lawyer.  I don't want to take anything away from Lanny Davis as a lawyer, but he is one of Hillary Clinton's closest friends, and here was a chance... to really get the knife out and see if he couldn't do some damage to the president.  In the end, this is noise.  This will go away.  I mean, the big story today is in Hanoi.  It's not on Capitol Hill.  And it is the president of the United States taking courageous steps to try to end what is a 69-year conflict and doing so in a way which has the support of the president of South Korea and may well be making some progress.  It's a difficult challenge.  But as you were pointing out just before I came on the show, we were averaging, I think, one missile firing every 24 days under Barack Obama.  And now it's quiet.  And I regard that as a substantial step in the right direction. ",

That we will always be trying to help, always trying to find a way to reunite you with your family.  And I think that's a very important part of being American.

I mean, this is truly becoming a stupid party, because the ideas are crazy.  Let's take the provision in the so-called Green Proposal that they're going to retrofit every building in America.
