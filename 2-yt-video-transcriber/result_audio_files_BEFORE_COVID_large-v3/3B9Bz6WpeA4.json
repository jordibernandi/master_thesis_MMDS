            "text": "we approached the top of this cycle of the solar minimum there has been a lack of sunspot activity but now they're saying that due to the sunspots that are coming around the Sun right now because they are earth-facing they're sending out this stream of particle energy and that this is expected to cause a storm into Sunday into Monday after this weekend and into next week in terms of the energy coming in now.  The more we start to see this, we're going to have to pay attention because the Earth's magnetic field is fluctuating and weakening as the magnetic North Pole is moving.  It's running.  It's heading in an unknown spot.  We know the direction that it's going in, but we don't know where it's going to slow down and eventually stop.  Now, there are such things as magnetic pole reversals.  We've seen them in the past.  This is outside of a physical pole reversal where the whole planet would flip.  We're talking a magnetic pole flip, which they know this has happened in the past.  You also have the chance... of these incoming particles or energy streams damaging the power grid or things like that if our magnetic field is weakened enough to where these particles can get through and highly charge those technologies, whether they're power cables, computers, no matter what they are worldwide.  We've seen this in the past.  It doesn't have to be an EMP.  It could be a release of energy from the sun.  But I just wanted to make note of it.  Right now, as we see the stream of energy that is heading toward Earth, wanted to put the heads up out there in case we do see anything next week.  Tonight, you should also be able to check out what they call the sprouting grass moon or the pink moon later tonight.  And also, this is the season for sprites, as you can see here.  And these are columns of light that you can see in the sky that form from light rising up through ice crystals and different particulates that are in the atmosphere that allow them to reflect these different colors of light from the ground and from different places.
