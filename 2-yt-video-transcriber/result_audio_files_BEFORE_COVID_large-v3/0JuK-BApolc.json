            "text": "Paleolithic Europe was very cold.  Middle Pleistocene glaciation in Britain was called the Anglian.  Neanderthals arrived 400,000 years ago and built flint hand axes like these.  It got so cold that they all left, and Britain was empty for over 100,000 years, until 60,000 years ago, when Neanderthals returned.  They were joined by the first modern humans about 40,000 years ago, but eventually all of these died or left too, until finally the Ice Age ended.  The end of the Ice Age saw a new era in European history.  The Mesolithic.  The warm climate resulted in a changed landscape.  The old pine forests and frozen plains were replaced by lush broadleaf woodlands.  The melted glaciers left canyons and gorges.  Many animals flourished, such as wisent and aurochs, as well as many smaller ones.  The European Mesolithic began over 14,000 years ago in the Balkans as a new race of hunter-gatherers arrived.  and they reached Britain by 11,700 years ago.  These semi-nomadic tribes are known by geneticists as Western hunter-gatherers, and they lived in caves, plateaus, and beneath rock shelters in valleys and gorges across Western and Central Europe.  Early anthropologists called these robust skulled people Cro-Magnons, and modern genetic analysis reveals that they all had blue eyes, swarthy complexions, and are associated with the maternal haplogroup U5.  Mesolithic hand axes look quite like those that came before.  But these geometric microliths are characteristic of the Mesolithic.  Geometric microliths come in three types, triangular, trapezoid or lunate.  All of them are carved from one of these, a microburin.  Hunter didn't need to carry all these tools with him, just a microburin from which he could make any tool he needed as and when it was required. ",

Deep inside the cliffs are these caves, and it was in this cave, Gough's cave, that Cheddar Man was found.  The Victorian explorer who found it named the main cavern after a cathedral.  It is likely the Mesolithic men attached a religious significance to caves as well. ",

            "text": "It was in a cave just like this that explorers and archaeologists in the late 19th century discovered that there were cave people living here.  And specifically, a very famous one was found in the early 20th century.  His skull was put on display at the beginning of the 20th century.  His bones had all been put together, full skeleton, by 1921.  And he was understood quite early on to be someone who was neither from the Paleolithic, nor from the Neolithic, someone in between, the Mesolithic, in between those times, the Middle Stone Age.  And the New Stone Age and the Old Stone Age, historically they were already recognized by different types of archaeological cultures arriving.  But now we know as well that these exact periods are marked by genetic shifts in the European landscape.  The Mesolithic period in Europe has a specific genetic identity of hunter-gatherers in Western Europe and Central Europe who form one genetic group and we take DNA from them.  Unlike the Paleolithic hunter-gatherers who preceded them, who lived very similar lifestyles but slightly different.  The main thing that distinguished the Paleolithic and the Mesolithic was the temperature.  The Ice Age ended and began what we call the Holocene.  It's what we still live in now.  Now, people in the Paleolithic were painting cave paintings and stuff like those I've looked at in other videos.  And there are also some Mesolithic cave paintings as well, slightly different.  But what's interesting is that the Mesolithic people did actually live in caves.  I don't think that was as common before, but we find that people definitely were living in caves in the Mesolithic.  So the term caveman really is appropriate for people like Ched and Man.  This genetic group that Cheddar Man belongs to, and he was found in the cave, not this specific cave, but one of the other caves in here, right here in Cheddar Gorge.  He's named after Cheddar Gorge, but This group is known as the Willebrunner Cluster, or as the Western hunter-gatherers, meaning Western European hunter-gatherers, as opposed to Eastern European hunter-gatherers.  The Eastern European hunter-gatherers were different because they had a lot of ancestry from Siberian hunter-gatherers of the Paleolithic called Ancient North Eurasians.  Western hunter-gatherers didn't have that admixture.  but we call it the Willebrunner Cluster in scientific terms because the oldest of them all was found as about 14,000 year old Villabruna man.  And Villabruna man is found in Italy in a cave named after the guy who discovered it.  It's in northeast Italy.  The guy's name was Villabruna.  But one of the guys there, one of the skeletons there, they found from it viable DNA.  And they've analyzed that DNA, just like they've recently analyzed Cheddar man's DNA.  And they're related.  And they've also got other Mesolithic hunter-gatherers from across Europe.  From Spain, there's a famous one called Labrana man.  And all of them related.  And it's Villa Brunner Cluster because the Villa Brunner guy 14,000 years ago represents an early arrival of these people.  Villa Brunner Man is R1B haplogroup.  Most of the people with R1B in Europe now are from a much later migration of Indo-Europeans who brought that in.  But R1B was present in the Mesolithic in Europe as well among some Western hunter-gatherers like Villa Brunner Man.  Our man Chidaman, his maternal haplogroup was U5, and that was very common among the Mesolithic hunter-gatherers, whereas the previous hunter-gatherers, the Paleolithic, had maternal haplogroups that we now associate with Asian people.  Whereas U5, which our man Cheddar Man had, I've got that too.  That's the same one I got from my mother.  And it's an indigenous European haplogroup.  U5 is very much associated with indigenous Europeans.  It's quite common up in northeastern Europe among the Sami as well.  Now, they also have quite a lot of Western hunter-gatherer admixture.  The further north in Europe you go, the more closely related people are to people like Cheddar Man. ",

            "text": "This map shows the amount of Western hunter-gatherer admixture in modern Europeans, and as you can see, it gets higher in the north.  This is a principal component analysis chart, and it shows us the genetic groups that modern and ancient populations belong to.  These are all modern Europeans, and these yellow bits are near Easterners, and the Turks are up here.  This purple blob is modern British people.  The blue shapes out here are all Pleistocene hunter-gatherers, and the green shapes are Mesolithic hunter-gatherers from Britain.  You can see they are all nearer to modern Europeans than anything else.  This one here is Cheddar Man, and this one is Loche Boer Man, who I showed earlier, and this one is Villa Brunner Man. ",

            "text": "Wow.  Let's take a look at that.  really epic landscapes.  Funny thing the thing that Chetaman and Villabrunnaman have in common is they were both found in epic mountainous landscapes, both found in caves.  That's not a coincidence obviously because if they hadn't died in the cave then their bones wouldn't have been preserved.  so maybe we over exaggerate just how important caves were to them, their lifestyles, because those are the only places we find them for rather, you know, obvious reasons.  But else we know about mesolithic people?  well they came into europe just as the ice age was ending and it was much warmer.  it's nice.  it's like this.  maybe today's a warm day and um obviously the paleolithic people didn't live.  there weren't very many of them.  there was only about 3 000 people in the whole of western and central europe during the paleolithic at one stage.  estimates currently show well the Mesolithic people start to increase in number.  Now, it's still Stone Age, they're still cavemen, but it's maybe a little bit more advanced than you expect.  So these guys came in to Europe, started populating people like Willebrunner around 14,000 years ago.  Shortly after then, the Ice Age really finishes and it gets much warmer.  And they're able to flourish and hunt to a great degree.  You know, hunt quite well across Europe.  There's a lot of decent stuff for them to eat there.  This kind of landscape had all sorts of prey for them.  Great for hunting.  mountain goats, lots of deer.  No Mesolithic people in Britain ate deer and hunted deer because we found up in Yorkshire Mesolithic front, like head mounts of antlers.  Big antler things from deer.  They kill the deer and take the top part of the skull, put it on their head and wear it.  Why?  Only two possible reasons I can think of.  One is that they're trying to look like a deer as they're stalking it so it doesn't get too, you know, spooked and run away.  And they can get close enough that they can chuck a spear in it.  The other thing, it could be some kind of ceremonial shamanic thing.  There is a cave painting of a kind of half-deer, half-man creature in Europe.  Maybe that refers to this kind of hunter-gatherer shamanic cult where people would wear these horns or maybe it's both.  maybe they had a practical and a religious function.  you know another strange thing about the mesolithic people.  now mesolithic means stone age and neolithic is the final like new stone age and that's marked by the arrival of farming from the middle east.  thing about the Mesolithic is actually they did have farming already to some degree like not really advanced farming but they were growing in Western Europe types of grasses that were domesticated or came from the Middle East already and they were making bread out of wild grasses.  so they weren't like you know plowing fields.  they didn't have plows they didn't have domesticated oxen to draw plows but they did gather grass seeds and make flour and bread and they did even have grass seeds from the Middle East.  So that shows this is kind of not like your typical stereotypical Ooga Booga caveman.  Now the actual.  we may have very small amounts, very small amounts of legacy from the Paleolithic cavemen, the hunter-gatherers, from tiny refugia of them who maybe left a little legacy in subsequent hunter-gatherers.  But as I say, most of our hunter-gatherer DNA as Europeans today come from Mesolithic hunter-gatherers, the two groups, the Western hunter-gatherer and the Eastern hunter-gatherer.  And in Scandinavia and the Baltic, there was a mixed population, which we call Scandinavian hunter-gatherers, which are half and half.  eastern hunter-gatherers who were very actually quite closely related to western hunter-gatherers.  they're more.  they're more based in eastern europe and they have their ancestry up on the siberian tundra where the ancient north eurasians came from.  that's where their ancestors were and you can see my video about ancient north eurasians to learn more about them.  So another difference though between these two guys, Eastern hunter-gatherers and Scandinavian hunter-gatherers, they had the same complexion as me, quite pale.  but they didn't have eyes like me.  See, my eyes are greenish blue.  They all had brown eyes.  But Western hunter-gatherers, like Cheddar Man, who lived here, they had eyes like me, like bluish or greenish eyes.  Blue in the case of, actually, is the reality, all blue eyes.  In fact, every single Western hunter-gatherer had blue eyes.  The whole of Europe, Western Europe, from Britain down to Spain, Italy, all of Central Europe, all, everyone had blue eyes.  but they didn't have the same skin color as us.  they were a bit darker because they haven't got the same genes associated with our pale skin like eastern hunter-gatherers do so.  basically we've taken the eyes from the western hunter-gatherers and the skin from the eastern hunter-gatherers to make us look the way we are now and all indigenous european phenotypes.  but how dark were they?  hard to say.  obviously you've seen the news where they tried to make out who's very dark.  that's quite unlikely.  it was warm then but it wasn't that warm and you could get vitamin d deficiency quite easily if you didn't have a pale enough skin to absorb vitamin d through the sun like i can and like i'm doing right now.  it's lovely.  Maybe they could survive with dark skin.  There is a group of hunter-gatherers who live in a cold climate with dark skin and survive, like parts in Tasmania.  They can do that.  They did that for a while.  They're extinct now.  But generally, hunter-gatherers that do that, They need to eat a lot of shellfish, a lot.  They need to be near the beach so they can eat lots of crabs and mollusks and things like that could get their vitamin D because vitamin D is a is a chemical.  It's not really found.  It's not found in plant matter.  It's only found in animal matter produced by our bodies.  It's produced in.  You can get it in organs as well, they could eat a lot of liver.  Like Eskimos don't have very light skin, they don't have much sunlight, but they have to eat all the weird bits of animal that we don't eat now.  So maybe that's what Tehran and his people did if they were as dark as it said in the news.  But it's always a possibility.  they weren't that dark.  I mean, they could be as dark as an Arab, as dark as an Indian.  They weren't black people.  Sorry if you think they were Kangs, but it's not true.  They weren't black people.  Their closest living relatives are northern Europeans, and in every respect phenotypically they were European, except perhaps complexion.  So to call them any other ethnicity except European is just plain wrong.  Sorry. ",

            "text": "While Paleolithic cave paintings are famous for their realistic depiction of animals, Mesolithic art in Europe is rarer and focuses more on humans and rituals.  In Spain, the Western hunter-gatherers left many depictions of humans which had formerly been absent.  There are 45 human figures depicted in the caves of El Cogul.  Most famous are the nine women in the dance of Cogul.  who dance around an ithyphallic figure in what is apparently a fertility ritual.  in britain the tiny star-car pendant was found.  the eleven thousand year old artefact is the only engraved shale pendant found in europe.  Many argue this was a protective shamanic amulet, but who can say for sure what the markings mean?  The neighbours of the Western hunter-gatherers in Eastern Europe are called the Eastern hunter-gatherers, and they left a more impressive insight into their religion in the form of the Shigir idol from Russia.  the carvings on this eleven thousand five hundred year old larch idol were made with a beaver's jaw and teeth.  it is the oldest ritual wooden sculpture of a human figure in the world and was preserved because it was deposited into a bog just as much later.  nordic idols were Standing 2.8 meters high.  it was an imposing site and was most likely a god or some local spirit that these people worshipped.
