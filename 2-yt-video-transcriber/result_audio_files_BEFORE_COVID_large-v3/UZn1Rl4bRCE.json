I just think perhaps the atheist community is particularly susceptible to it.  Okay.  And also it could be a bias that I get just from the people that I interact with and observe.  But I happen to observe a lot of people that identify as atheists and the arguments they make.  And what I find is that on average... They seem to have this preconceived assumption that any position they hold is by default rational because they were rational about at least one decision, which leads them to very irrational conclusions that they insist are rational.  And in fact, often they will ignore other arguments or other evidence because they are sure that they are right and rational and anything else.  must be by default wrong.  And I was curious if you maybe observed a similar thing.  Again, maybe I'm just interacting with the wrong people. ",

We so highly value our rationality and our reason and our logic, and we think you are absolutely right.  We think that because we... for some of us, the process was so arduous and we had to work so hard applying those skills that now we do think we're good at it.  Sometimes we are and sometimes we're not.  And so, yes, I've been around folks and I've done it myself where because we have those skills and we start to apply them, then we think we are.  I hope that the rest of your statement isn't that we're so terribly obnoxious, but I'm afraid that it is.  I've been guilty of that myself.  Not only have we honed those skills, not only have we had to practice it, we're proud of it because so many of us had to work so hard to get there.  When we came up against it as religious people and had to work to discard some of that and figure out.  okay here's the thing I believe now is this let me does this is this reasonable?  is this based on science?  is this based on observation or is this just a thing that I learned somewhere along the way?  we understand what childhood indoctrination is and so we fight to overcome that and so I have to do that regularly.  We're in this new era of politics.  We're not going to get too far afield with politics, but we have these assumptions and we have these ideas.  And so we make an assessment, we make a decision, and we're absolutely sure that we've applied reason and logic.  you are right sometimes we're as guilty of being human we're guilty of being indoctrinated we're guilty of being influenced we're guilty of being part of a community.  we're guilty of being biased.  we're guilty of wanting things to be a way.  so i i don't think you're going to get any argument from me dan.  i have another approach.

We're particularly \u2013 When it comes to seeing religious abuses, I think that affects us a lot more in observation because most of us can empathize with that or most of us at least know people in our lives, if not ourselves, who have gone through some of that trauma or have gone through difficult situations when talking about religion.

I think it's interesting how much we disagree around here than what we agree on.

People will respect you for it.  Even if they don't exactly agree, if you have good reasons for it, if you have better reasons than most, then that's something that's worth fighting for.
