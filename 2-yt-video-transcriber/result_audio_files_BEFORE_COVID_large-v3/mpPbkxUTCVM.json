And within the next five years, um, we're going to have, um, severe storms, uh, food inflation, crop losses, um, globally.

I worked with the brass and the chiefs that did all the forecasts and ran operations, but I wasn't allowed to do the actual forecast, or if I did just a topography map or report of just using Copernicus effect meteorology to issue whether or not we could launch operations or a an aviator could take off, or a helicopter could take off.  I mean, they would even have to sign off on it, even though I did most of the work.  But that part of it was more considered long-term climate study.  And plus, back in the 90s, early 90s, this was 20 years off.  But here we are.  And climate change is real, but it's not caused by CO2 emissions.  It's caused by cyclical patterns of the sun dimming.  And all of this is being brought on for the lack of solar sunspot activity.  The sun is dying, waning.  What it is, we go over these slopes and go down the hills of peaking and cooling, peaking and cooling, but now these crescendos are going to get smaller and smaller and smaller, and we're not going to actually see a warming period like we saw in the 90s and early 2000s.  When we peak up again through the next 12 months, it's going to get a little bit warmer, but we're going to slide downhill even lower than where we hit this winter with our severe weather.  And this could, within five years, we could have... global famine.  We've already had global crop losses due to cold weather and natural disasters already.  We're already in the eddy minimum.  And we are overdue for what's called the Carrington event, which is where coronal mass ejection could affect our power grid.  We don't have the infrastructure to recover if that was to happen.

There's an endless, a bigger list than 21 of things that you should, you know, consider but not worry about.

You can't control what happens.  Even insurance has the act of God category.  There's just things you don't control.  You could be walking across the street and die.  That's something you can't control.  You can't control somebody else driving 90 and blindsiding you.  But what you can control is logical.

Mind you, it is only logical if you get insurance on your electronics, insurance on your wedding ring, insurance on your house, insurance on your car.  Why don't you have insurance on your body?  Have supplies, food, water, those kind of things.  If you put it in that kind of way, people won't consider you so nuts.
