            "text": "yo what is going on everybody?  i know you're gonna love this video.  you came here for the title right if you did smash the thumbs up but let's get into this.  so before you've already seen the title right.  so before i actually fully get into this video i just want to quickly uh give you a little preface here.  so we know that the dating world has been a shit show for a long time now.  now I know this may seem off topic, but what happens if you put a big fat slab of meat, right?  Or chop it up into thousands of pieces, right?  So you've got thousands of pieces of meat and you would just leave that out in the open in the sun for people to come and check out, right?  After a while, there's not going to be too much good quality meat left.  And in fact, some of it's going to start to go rotten.  And I'm not saying that women are pieces of meat.  I'm not saying that anyone's a piece of meat, even though technically in a way we are because we are all flesh and muscle and that is actually meat.  However, I just wanted to draw that comparison and analogy because what's happening is you attract the flies if you put meat out in the sun, right?  Whether that be male meat or female meat.  And flies can be pretty annoying, right?  And if there's enough meat, there's gonna be a shit ton of flies, right?  So look, we're all meat and we just need to stay fresh, right?  So that's why you should shower.  Anyway, I think you've gotten my point, at least to some degree.  You know, eventually the dating apps are just basically a pile of rotten meat on both sides and not going to work out too well.  So let's check this one here.  Why I stopped online dating and started fingering my own ass.  Now YouTube censors don't shoot the messenger.  This is the title of this article.  See what I'm saying?  From Reductress, and anyone who's seen Reductress before will know exactly what they're like.  All right, so smash that thumbs up as I get into this.  We all know that online dating is a trash fire, contributing to lower self-esteem and even depression.  Looking for love or even just casual sex on the apps requires submitting yourself to unsolicited dick pics, nerve-wracking selfie rejection, and... selfie selection and constant rejection.  nerve-wracking selfie selection.  so you mean picking three selfies out of the 300 you just took in the ladies bathroom.  so this year i decided to delete all of the apps guys.  by the way this isn't me referring to myself just to be just to be really clear.  just to be really clear.  i'm just reading the article that a woman wrote.  so You know, don't act like this.  is me doing this, right?  So this year I decided to delete all of the apps and just start fingering my own arse.  That's right!  Now whenever I get the urge to swipe right, I instead swipe some lube on my finger and pleasure my butthole.  Making forced small talk with strangers and going on date after excruciating date sets you up for disappointment and feeling like true joy is out of reach.  But buying yourself a drink, pulling on a latex glove, I learned this in a sex class, and massaging your own asshole all night will never disappoint.  These days, I can't believe how much time I used to devote to searching through the apps for available partners before I could even get in the room with somebody who I may or may not have any chemistry with.  Now I can spend a fraction of that time teasing and training my asshole before having a mind-blowing anal orgasm.  I've read entire books with the time I've gained and my ass is happier than ever.  Anyone who's informed about anal play know that it's best to get comfortable with it on your own before bringing in a partner.  But what I can tell you is that it's even better to bring in a partner never.  That's because it saves you from ever having to open any dating app.  Or look at a blurred photo of a guy holding a beer.  Or chat with someone whose response to your job title is, What's that?  Nope, you can be riding solo on your own lubed finger.  Happily ever after.  I promise you won't be disappointed.  Oh yeah!  So... As you can see, this is where all the discarded pieces of meat end up after they realize that even the flyers aren't interested.
