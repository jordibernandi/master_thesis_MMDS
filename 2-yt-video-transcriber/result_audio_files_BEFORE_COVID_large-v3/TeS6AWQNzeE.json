            "text": "Oh, no, don't get me wrong.  I like Laphroaig.  It just doesn't hold a candle to Lagavulin.  That's all I'm saying.  Oh, excuse me.  It's my wife.  I'll just take it.  Hello?  Well, yes, I'm just here with my lawyer.  Is it urgent?  The what?  Oh, my goodness.  Uh, perhaps.  But we don't... Exactly, yes.  No, it could be, it could be.  But wait till nightfall.  Yes, wait till nightfall.  Yes, I think that's best.  All right?  No, that's fine, that's fine, yes.  I love you too.  Bye-bye.  Trouble, Mr.  Mondobank?  I'm sorry.  My parents-in-law, they found a baby bunny.  They'd found a baby bunny in their garden.  It hadn't moved all day.  No sign of its mother.  Should they take it?  Did we want it as a pet for Matilda?  I told my wife to tell them to wait till nightfall.  If it were still alone, we'd better take it before something else did.  I think you made the correct decision, Mr.  Mountebank.  Thank you, Counselor.  Well, he went unclaimed that night, so he became ours, after the vet checked him out.  And he was a sweet little guy.  He'd rest in our hands.  He had no fear of us at all.  Matilda loved him.  One morning, he was gone.  Where's the bunny?  Well, last night, after you went to bed, the doorbell rang.  It was Mother Bunny.  oh pardon me mr mountebank she said i'm looking for baby bunny.  well he got lost in grandma and grandpa's garden but don't worry he's safe with us.  would you like to come in and have tea?  no thank you mr mountebank.  i don't want to disturb you any more.  i'll just take baby bunny straight home if you please.  yes of course so baby bunny went home with his mummy.  Matilda was happy with this, and if you're happy with this ending, I invite you to stop watching now.  I'll give you a little time to change the channel.  And if you're still with us and you'd like to know the The real ending, please be advised, it's not for small children.  Mature content.  Hello?  What?  No, I'm at the fish van.  The fish van.  He... He what?  What does it look like?  I'm coming now.  Sorry, boys.  Gotta go.  There's something wrong with Baby Bunny.  He had had a seizure, a very violent, cage-rattling seizure.  Oh dear, it's neurological, probably why his mother abandoned him.  I'd like to hope it will go away, but it will probably get worse and worse.  So it did.  The seizures came more frequently, and they were longer and stronger.  I tried to make an animated reconstruction of these seizures, but my efforts felt wrong.  It felt as if I was demeaning our baby bunny.  It felt undignified.  So instead, I found this video footage of a rabbit in the wild having a seizure.  I'll play it without sound.  If you are sensitive, you might not want to watch this.  Our baby bunny's seizures looked like that.  We had to swaddle him in a towel and hold him all the time so he wouldn't break his bones, thrashing against the cage.  He was panting and crying always.  I'll take him to the vet in the morning.  I'll have him put down.  Oh, jeez, there he goes again!  I'm not making him wait till morning.  What are you going to do?  I'm going to take care of him myself.  How?  I'll tell you tomorrow.  You go to bed now.  Let me do this by myself.  Are you sure?  Yes.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  Say goodnight to Bunny.  Say goodnight.  My wife kissed Bunny and went to bed.  I waited about an hour.  I had a glass of Dutch courage.  My great-grandmother drowned when she was a girl.  Almost drowned.  She was saved in the nick of time.  She remembered she resented being saved, because after the initial struggle, she said, drowning was the most peaceful experience she'd ever known.  I got undressed.  I took Bunny into the bathroom.  I filled a bucket with warm water and I let Bunny get accustomed to it.  Then I held him down.  He never struggled. ",
