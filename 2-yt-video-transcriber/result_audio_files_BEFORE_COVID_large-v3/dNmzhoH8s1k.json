            "text": "Good evening, brothers and sisters, and blessings to all of you across the nations.  My name is Rachel Seller, and I'm the founder of Fisher of Men Ministry.  I'd like to introduce myself.  On October 14, 2019, Fisher of Men Ministry filed articles of incorporation as a nonprofit church.  We are a healing ministry operating out of the United States.  and the United Kingdom.  I have some fresh manna for you for the new year.  The fresh manna for the new year is a time of repentance, discipline, and obedience.  In order to have obedience, we need to have discipline in our life.  A cleansing of the mind, body, and the spirit.  So, I'd like to start with James 5, verse 16.  Therefore, confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed.  The prayer of the righteous avail much.  How many of us have friends that we can trust spiritually that are mature?  How do you sharpen iron?  Proverbs 27, verse 17 says, As iron sharpens iron, so one person sharpens another.  So I'd like to confess some of my sins to you.  During my 20s, I spent time in prison.  I spent one year in prison.  And I struggled with addiction in my life.  I was told that I could never become a registered nurse because I had felonies on my record.  I put my faith in the Lord and asked God to just take over.  I graduated a $35,000 nursing school not knowing if I would even get a license.  I took a leap of faith and I put my faith in God.  And I believe that it's because of God.  I'm a registered nurse today.  I've been studying natural medicine for the last three years at Pan American University, one of the original schools in 1979 from Florida.  So some of my sins was that drug addiction was a big part of my life in my 20s.  I had an addiction to a prescription drug called Adderall.  cocaine in my 20s, designer party drugs.  And so I'm confessing these sins to you, brothers and sisters, so that you will pray for me.  And I always need prayer.  Everyone needs prayer.  So I'd like to present some fresh manna.  So, what kind, here's instructions from the Lord.  One second.  Okay.  Oh gosh, I can't find my scripture.  Okay.  Heal the sick.  Oh, sorry.  Matthew chapter 10, verse 8.  Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse those who have leprosy, and drive out demons.  When I say demons, what comes to mind?  What kind of demons?  I think of a demon of addiction.  I think of a demon, a spirit of unforgiveness.  Okay, so just that's a question.  So, In regards to demons, identifying the problem that you want to remove and strip off.  We're talking about childish behavior.  Spirits of unforgiveness.  When God says be quick to forgive, what does quick mean?  How long do we wait to forgive somebody in our life?  Okay, so this repentance thing is so important.  We need to heal the mind, body and spirit.  So we need to identify what our problem is.  Whatever demon is plaguing us.  Is it depression?  Is it spirit of gluttony?  We just eat and eat and we just have these different addictions that I see plaguing so many people, including myself.  Addiction was something I've struggled with in my life.  So we identify the problem and And to have healing, we need to cleanse ourselves.  So then that comes the discipline.  If you want to take care of the body, you want to reverse disease, you need to have discipline.  You can't eat whatever you want.  There has to be self-control.  So speaking about the discipline, it says 1 Corinthians 3, verse 3.  You are still worldly, for since there is jealousy and quarreling among you, are you not worldly?  Are you not acting like mere humans?  And so where I'm at with this whole discipline thing is I became fascinated with spiritual warfare.  and when the disciples were trying to cast out a demon and they asked Jesus why they weren't able to do it, Jesus said, because this one goes out only by fasting and prayer.  So I became interested in that.  So what can we do to be obedient?  Are we quick to forgive?  And I mean, when God says love your enemy, are you able to go to that person or family member that you had conflict with and truly look at them and not think about anything that you resent?  You know, we have to ask ourselves this question.  This is something I've struggled with in my own personal life.  Family issues, you know, relationships.  And I've repented so many times and I just get frustrated because that spirit of unforgiveness just has a way of coming back sometimes.  So in Mark chapter 9, verse 28 and 29, it said, And when he was come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, Why couldn't we drive it out?  And he said to them, This kind can come forth.  by nothing but prayer and fasting.  Brothers and sisters, I'd like you to pay attention to the scripture and that is from King James Version.  They took out fasting in some of the other versions.  So this discipline that I created for people to help people heal themselves at home requires fasting and prayer.  It's part of the plan.  And that was one of the things I wrestled with for a while.  I'm like, how am I growing spiritually?  Am I growing?  Well, if there's a demon that I want to cast out, the Lord said, drive out demons, demons of addiction, whatever.  And this one requires fasting and prayer.  Fasting was something that I had not fully been able to do.  I never really set my mind to it.  It was challenging, and it's always going to be a challenge in some ways.  But now that I've done that, it's a very good feeling to know when God says heal the sick, to lay hands on the sick, to anoint them with oil, take authority over sickness or cancer and speak to it and command it out.  That's power.  The reason I started this ministry, this ministry is a healing ministry to bring truth and revelation to the nations.  I went to nursing school thinking one thing and had a traumatic experience waking up to this corrupt scientific community of indoctrination.  We're pushing pill carts.  And I said, I'm leaving the pill cart to go behind the pulpit because the truth needs to be spoken about this corruption.  And the nurses, many of us would sit around and say, we're poisoning them.  We're poisoning people.  And they would come around with the vaccines and say, well, you know, if they don't get you early on with them, they'll get you later in the nursing home.  And they call it Black Friday.  I have moms from all the other side of the world in Macedonia sending me vaccine-injured kids having seizures, you know?  So this is a very important time.  We need revelation and we need truth.  You can't have truth, you can't have healing if you don't have truth.  And we're lacking unity in our community.  So I just wanted to bring you this repentance, discipline, I call it the discipline that I created, and obedience as a way of healing the mind, body, and the spirit.  It's fresh bread for the new year.  It's casting out demons, repenting, and maturing spiritually, being refined in the fire, stripping off the things of the world, stripping off the behavior, the childish behaviors.  We want spiritual promotion.  We want spiritual growth.  So if any of you has a sickness and wants to be healed, now is the time to plug into the word of God and trust that you have authority over sickness.  Okay?  God gives us that authority and sickness has spiritual roots and this is what's not being talked about and goes beyond science.  So I just wanted to bring everyone blessings for the new year.  And I'm here to make YouTube videos.  The forensic nurse is the other name I go by on social media.  I'm self-employed.  I do not work in conventional nursing setting.  So I gather evidence about the populations from around the world, in particular relating to vaccine injury and sickness of all kinds, autoimmune disease.  So you can find me on social media on LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, theforensicnurse.org, but also fisherofmenministry.org.  So my connection in the United Kingdom is a nurse practitioner.  Her name is Kay Sharmani.  And she's going to be working with Together in Unity, a Fishermen ministry.  So I'm very excited about bringing the truth to the nations about healing and the information that you're not being given by the scientific and medical community.  So I thank you for listening to this message and signing off for now. ",
