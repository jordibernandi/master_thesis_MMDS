And I took one body out at a time, and I just took pictures of them.  I took pictures of the little ones and the bigger ones, and I determined the time, the age that they were.  And then one of the ones I decided to take was one that I would hold just the child's between my fingers.  And the only reason I did that was because if I just took a picture of a small infant, prenatal infant, nobody would really be able to know how large that child is.  And when the pictures came out, I looked at them and I thought, you know, the one with the hand and the feet is better than I thought.  Those people were saying that people that haven't been born yet, but they're still in the body and alive, that they're just pieces of whatever.  And I knew, because I was a doctor, that... abortions kill children, they kill human beings. ",
