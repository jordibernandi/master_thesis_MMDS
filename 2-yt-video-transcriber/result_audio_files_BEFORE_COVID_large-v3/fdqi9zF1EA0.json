            "text": "This is London, but broadcasting to you, of course, all over the world, thanks to the wonders of the Internet and SputnikNews.com.  You can listen to the show on FM 105.5, other magic numbers in the Washington, D.C.  area.  You can listen on AM from coast to coast across the United States of America.  But this is a radio show with pictures, and you can watch us on Facebook, on YouTube, and on Twitter, and lots of new ways that I don't even understand or recognize the names of, but I'll be telling you them as my intelligent friends through the glass.  tee me up to do so.  Now, last week's show, which was special in many ways, was watched by 1,115,000 people and counting.  That's 1,115,000 viewers.  As I've said to you many times, we have no idea how many people are merely listening online, FM, AM, etc.  So our actual audience for last week, if you added the listenership to the viewership is becoming stratospheric, but it means I need to set a new target.  As you know, I have repeatedly said I wanted to get to one million viewers.  Well, now I want to get to two million viewers.  So if you are watching on Facebook, share, share, share other magic words there, because if you do, we'll quickly get up towards that audience of two million viewers plus listeners.  every single week.  And that's important because the phenomenal success of this show in just 29 weeks, remember, from a standing start with no advertising budget, no press coverage, except in the Daily Express, with whom I've become unusually close over the last few months for reasons I don't fully understand.  No newspaper, television show, or radio show anywhere else has mentioned our existence.  So what does that one million plus audience tell you?  It tells you that all over the world there's a tremendous hunger for a different analysis of events, for a different narrative, one that more fully squares with the common sense of the majority of thinking people around the world.  And you are not going to find that on what they laughably still describe as the mainstream media.  We are the new mainstream media.  Our audience is many times the readership of The Guardian.  It's multiple times the readership of The Independent and of most British newspapers.  It's many times higher than most current affair programs here in the United Kingdom, and actually bigger than many in the United States, a country of more than 300 million people.  The reality is... that we are providing a space, a free space, where alternative events, alternative narratives, alternative perspectives can be shared amongst thinking people.  It's not called a university for nothing.  And no view is proscribed here.  I'll tell you if I think it's nonsense, but you won't be stopped from articulating it.  So you can phone us.  You can tweet us.  You can even email us.  And above all, you can phone us on numbers that will be coming up on the screen.  There's lots to talk about tonight.  I want to talk about breaking news.  the Board of Deputies of British Jews, which claims to be the leadership of the Jewish community in Britain.  It's not my business whether they are or are not the actual leadership, though I do see lots of dissident Jewish voices on social media.  making it clear that the Board of Deputies does not speak for them.  But that's a matter for the Jewish community.  Judaism is a religion.  Its adherents, Jews, are a religious group.  All religious groups have to be honored treasured, cherished, and protected here in a free country, a democracy like ours.  But no religious group has the right to dictate policy and membership of any political party.  Now, to be fair, their list of 10 demands, 10 commandments, I think they wanted us to call them.  So there you are, BOD, 10 commandments, from Britain's Jewish community to the British Labour Party, were breathtaking in their audacity.  Chutzpah doesn't begin to describe it.  Imagine my surprise then, when every single candidate for the leadership of the Labour Party to succeed Jeremy Corbyn immediately, in Emily Thornberry, the shadow Foreign Secretary's words, fell onto their hands and knees in supplication.  Well, a party that allows a small religious minority to dictate its policies and dictate whom by name it may be allowed to admit into membership is not a party that is likely to thrive.  It will not thrive, even in the sense that the people doing the supplicating hope it will not be the end of the war against the Labour Party, because this issue of anti-Semitism has been weaponized with the purpose of destroying any meaningful Labour Party.  Of course, a Labour Party like Tony Blair's Labour Party, there will always be space for that.  But if the Labour Party goes back, as it seems to be doing, to the blandness and the inoffensiveness of the Tony Blair era, inoffensive that is to the power in the land and in the world, inoffensive to the rich and powerful.  If it goes back to that, then hundreds of thousands of Labour Party members will be looking for a new home.  We'll be talking about this in the course of the show.  And of course, we'll be talking about World War III.  that nearly happened.  Last week, after our show, the murder, cold-blooded terrorist criminal murder of the Iranian general Qasem Soleimani almost started World War III because, as I said here, Iran had no alternative but to respond to it.  And if Donald Trump had responded to their response, then we would already be in the middle.  if not of World War III, then of war throughout the world.  And that war would have been unpredictable, violent, bloody, and potentially never-ending.  After all, the Iraq war is still rumbling all these years after Mr.  Bush and Mr.  Blair shook hands on democracy in Iraq.  What price democracy then in Iraq?  Because The Iraqi parliament and prime minister have both told the U.S.  occupation force in the country that they must leave and that they must begin now that withdrawal.  And the United States government have boldly declared that we are staying.  In other words, their occupation of a sovereign country with whom they're supposedly in a treaty alliance is worth nothing, not even the paper that it's written on.  Well, I'm here to predict to you that the United States will be leaving Iraq.  It will either leave by agreement, by negotiation, in good order and peacefully, or it will leave under fire amidst chaos and bloodshed.  But one way or another. ",
