            "text": "The past week has been a victorious time for Matteo Salvini.  On Monday the Italian Senate passed Salvini's new security bill by a large margin.  The bill had already been passed by the House of Deputies, but it needed to be passed by the Senate before summer recess began on Wednesday.  Salvini used a procedure where he coupled the security bill with a confidence vote in order to speed up the process.  According to numerous media sources, Salvini would have actually had to resign as Interior Minister had the vote failed.  The new bill further cracks down on human trafficking as well as drug smuggling and organized crime.  The key provision of the bill increases fines for NGO ships engaged in human trafficking.  The ships now face fines of up to 1 million euros.  Italy is currently in a standoff with multiple NGO ships.  The latest development is that American actor Richard Gere is apparently on board a trafficking ship operated by the Spanish NGO Open Arms.  That ship has picked up a load of economic migrants and is expected to attempt to ferry them to an Italian port.  A bundle of lawsuits is also being prepared to try to force other European governments to rein in NGOs that are engaged in criminal trafficking activity in the Mediterranean.  Salvini has been engaged in a whirlwind of press conferences and public rallies.  Now, for the first time, he is openly calling for an early snap election.  Currently, Salvini's Lega Party rules Italy in a coalition government with the Five Star Movement.  Many English language media outlets claim Five Star is a right-wing party.  This is just not true.  It is a big tent anti-establishment populist party.  They have people from all over the spectrum, even people who are very left-wing.  In some ways, you can compare Five Star to the French Yellow Vest movement.  In some ways, you can compare it to Zelensky's party in Ukraine.  It is not easily defined using conventional left-right terminology.  In the 2018 general election, Five Star won a dramatic 33.7%, and Lega won 17.4%.  The leaders of the two parties became co-deputy prime ministers, with Salvini also getting the position of interior minister, and Five Star leader Luigi Di Maio becoming the minister of economic and social development.  The coalition between Lega and Five Star was based in part on the fact that both parties were willing to defy the EU on several key issues.  However, the coalition has been turning sour as Lega has risen and Five Star has fallen in popularity.  In the 2019 EU election, Lega got 34.3% and Five Star only got 17.1%.  They basically switched places in one year's time.  Currently, Salvini's Lega party is polling in the high 30s and the center-right coalition is collectively polling over 50%.  The center-right coalition consists of Lega, Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia, and Fratelli di Italia, or Brothers of Italy.  Forza Italia was once the dominant party of the center-right coalition.  Now they are competing with Fratelli for second place.  Based on current polls, if an early election was held now, Lega and Fratelli could potentially take over 50% of the seats.  They could potentially form a coalition government without even needing the help of Berlusconi's Forza Italia.  Five Star seems to be playing it cool and claims they are not afraid of an early snap election.  Among other things, Salvini says a new snap election would allow the government to rein in out-of-control activist judges.  He wants to bring an end to the judiciary attempting to usurp the entire Italian government.  Of course, right now there is a battle going on where the globalists in the EU pick and choose which countries they think that the judges should be given more power.  Matteo says he will not be taking a summer vacation, but will be working non-stop.  However, he said he would trade his suits for summer wear.  Recently, Salvini showed up at the annual Pompeto Beach Party, where he was given control of the DJ booth.  The hysterical media has spent the past week trying to invent scandals.  They claimed Salvini disgraced his office by standing too close to a go-go dancer and then posing with the girl while she took a selfie.  Except the photos of Salvini and the go-go dancer were from a 2016 beach party before he ever became interior minister.  They claim Salvini disgraced the national anthem of Italy by playing it at a beach party while wearing a swimsuit.  They claimed Salvini misused public resources because a police officer ferried his son on a law enforcement jet ski.  Anything to create a manufactured scandal.  If an early snap election were to take place, it is hard to even imagine how hysterical the media is going to become.  Across Europe, globalist politicians in the media are hyping Russia-Lega collusion conspiracies with increasing fanaticism.  I can remember when the media hysterically attacked Berlusconi.  This is going to be off the charts.  The Western media is going to elevate Matteo from Italian Trump to brutal dictator of a rogue state.  By the way, these alleged journalists who refer to everyone as M-X Trump or M-Y Trump, what they are saying is they do not actually have any knowledge of the subject matter and they are just writing clickbait aimed at a low information audience.  Also, I am looking forward to upcoming regional elections in Calabria, Emilia-Romagna, and Umbria.  All of these regions are currently controlled by the left.  It is going to be very exciting to see if they can be flipped.  Alright, thanks for watching this video.  Click the like button, post a comment, tell me what you think.
