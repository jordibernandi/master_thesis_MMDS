            "text": "So obviously that whole PewDiePie controversy happened.  I think it was late Thursday and sort of Friday British time and I made a video on it and it actually did well it's one of my best videos but of course if you make a video criticizing someone like PewDiePie you're gonna get a lot of hate.  so of course the video got brigaded by loads of his totally not racist his totally nice fans and they left loads of comments.  so the video currently has 10 000 views 855 comments 553 likes and 538 dislikes.  so i'm happy.  at least there are more likes and dislikes.  but it shows how crazy and rabid they went at me And I got a lot of criticism.  A lot of stuff was, you know, quite insane.  Stuff I've heard loads of times, you know, the insults the right wing like to trot out all the time.  So I'm going to read some of the best ones.  And I'm really going to show you how deluded and insane some of these people are.  But also people just seem like they're pretty ignorant or young and they give me some criticism, which I'm going to respond to because some of it... was pretty dumb.  for example i got a lot of criticism for this poster right here man the high castle poster saying that i love nazis because i like a tv show um about the resistance fighting nazis in nazi occupied america.  apparently that makes me a nazi but anyway i'm gonna get into all of that.  so firstly we have this rather insane individual the killer 1777 who's just said the jews caused the holocaust.  So yeah, that's lovely.  Some really anti-Semitic kid.  Maybe it's an adult, who knows, but obviously some crazy guy.  So the next comment from someone called Visuals Lee says, Okay, so to start with, the idea of the Holocaust certainly isn't completely without humour.  Now, I don't know if this guy is just trying to troll me or he's being serious.  I don't really know, to be honest.  Satire feels like it's dead at this point, especially in the age of Trump.  Every time you read a headline, it reads like the onion.  So here's another lovely fan of PewDiePie called Scotty, who says, so much misinformation in one video, so well done for that, and as for your knowledge on the Iron Cross, it's laughable, if not pathetic, and you have the gall to lecture others.  So I thought his symbol in his profile picture looked kind of nazi-ish because just the way it's sort of outlined and the three symbols i don't know it kind of reminded me of a swastika.  so i looked up.  you know what are three interlocking triangles.  what does that mean?  apparently it's a symbol that nordic neo-nazis like to use a lot.  so there you go proving once again that a lot of nazis do like pewdiepie especially from you know nordic territories.  so as i alluded to earlier i saw a lot of comments about the poster.  so here is just one.  there was plenty of them.  so he said Dude, you have a poster of a man in the high castle in your room, which is basically a Nazi's wet dream sequence.  Get the fuck out.  Unsubbed.  This guy wasn't unsubbed to me ever.  So, yeah, my main argument to all that stuff and how it's different, they're saying you don't like being taken out of context, right?  This is just a poster on my wall.  If you watch most of my videos, you'll see it here all the time.  So The Man in the High Castle was an anti-fascist book by Philip K. Dick.  He's the guy who wrote Minority Report.  He wrote the book that inspired Blade Runner.  All, you know, this great sci-fi.  But yeah, he was a big anti-fascist.  He's talked about anti-fascism.  It's meant to be a warning.  And the TV show is very similar.  It focuses around the resistance.  It has a lot of characters.  You have Nazi characters.  You have Japanese characters.  But it mainly focuses on the resistance and their fight against the Nazis and all these parallel universe sort of things.  It's a very good show.  I'd recommend it if you haven't watched it.  But it also likes to tackle a lot of the craziness of the Nazis' race science.  And it also tackles Trump in an interesting way.  in season four there's a scene where hitler youths in america go around with basically tiki torches smashing up the place and it's obviously a direct reference to trump.  so i have a poster of an anti-fascist tv show that has fascists in it of course because that's how you depict it.  it's like if i had the handmaid's tale poster.  doesn't mean i want that world.  it's the same sort of criticism.  films like blade runner 2049 have gone because like the world of that film is sexist and it's like well the director isn't saying he wants this world to exist.  it's a dystopia.  it's awful same with that.  so this poster just part of my room and like i said it's you know on the wall in all my videos basically.  so it's not like i was talking about jews and the holocaust and i was like look what i've got.  man the high castle poster with a um satchel liberty doing the nazi salute like pewdiepie's only symbol in his video was a cross.  that was it.  that's the only thing he had and that was my whole point.  he didn't think i'm wearing a cross that loads of neo-nazis use as a symbol.  people already think i'm part of the alt-right.  i know neo-nazis love me.  maybe i shouldn't wear this when i'm talking about jewish stuff.  and that was the only other symbol in his video apart from he was wearing a black jacket with just that symbol on it.  so completely different to me having this poster.  not that i need to defend having posters on my wall.  So someone else called Vandaren333 said, don't you see the irony comparing PewDiePie to Corbyn?  Both are leaders of huge racist fan bases.  In the case of Corbyn, you called it smear even though there are 100 cases of Labour antisemitism in later years.  And Jeremy was much often in company with Nazis.  So I guess this guy is admitting that PewDiePie has a racist fan base.  But I don't understand this whole stuff about Jeremy Corbyn being in company with Nazis.  It's obviously a lie.  And I've made videos about, you know, the Labour anti-Semitism thing.  Of course there are some examples of anti-Semitism in the Labour Party and I've talked about that, but it's blown way out of proportion, especially when the Tory party don't even accept the definition of anti-Semitism.  So here's another one.  I got a lot.  I said Ben Shapiro is part of the alt-right and lots of people were saying to me, how dare you say that, he's Jewish, the alt-right attack him.  Well, I'm just going to get into all this, but someone said, Simon Tide, I bet you really love communism too if you think Ben Shapiro is alt-right.  It's always white liberals who are racist who call Orthodox Jews Nazis.  To which I replied, he inspired more than one alt-right terror attack, so that's good enough for me.  Him being Jewish doesn't make him not racist.  Simon replied, that's rich coming from Antifa.  And I said, how many have Antifa killed?  None.  Throw a couple of milkshakes.  The alt-right are currently the biggest terrorists in the West.  Shows you don't actually care about white supremacy.  Now, in terms of the Jewish stuff and the alt-right, there's actually infighting in the alt-right whether or not they hate Jews, and that's why a lot of them split up, because they can't decide if they do hate Jews or they don't, or if they do like Israel or they don't.  So basically, my opinion is, yeah, Ben Shapiro is an Orthodox Jew.  He obviously gets targeted by a lot of people who hate Jews.  That's fair to say.  But at the same time, if you're pushing racist conspiracies, if you're pushing just general racism... against Arabs, against black people, against all this stuff.  If you directly inspire people to commit terrorist acts, like Ben Shapiro did, and various, you know, shooters have talked about the things Ben Shapiro talks about, I have no problem associating you with the alt-right.  So just another insane comment from Eagle and Dax saying, what a fucking joke you are, do your research better, you fucking moron.  He is not a Nazi, you're more a Nazi than him, by the support of a culture that's not only has a chaotic behavior, but also a disgusting way to respond to actual problems, fuck you.  So I don't understand how I would be a Nazi.  And the problem is, right, I never called PewDiePie a Nazi in the video, but they all just came in with this one defense.  It makes me think they were just going around different videos saying, how dare you call him a Nazi?  I don't think I ever said PewDiePie, you know, literally believes in the... the ideology of Nazism.  I just said that I'm skeptical of his beliefs because he has an association with the alt-right.  he knows he's had controversy with them but he still does stuff like that.  so I'm skeptical of what he actually believes even though to the public he hasn't shown that he actually believes in direct Nazism.  Him having someone like Ben Shapiro on his show and following loads of white supremacists on Twitter makes me skeptical of him being a good guy, as everyone tells me on these comments that, you know, he supports the LGBT community, all this stuff.  So I never directly said he was a Nazi, but I am skeptical of what he actually believes in.  So here's a comment that tries to directly correct me on everything I've said, correct me on all the racist controversies PewDiePie has.  So someone called Dorato says, I'm Polish, have Jews in my family, and I probably know something about German crimes during World War II.  For me, PewDiePie definitely is not a Nazi.  Again, I didn't say he was a Nazi.  So first of all, the kill all Jews fiber controversy, he did it for the meme.  And sure, this meme isn't great.  and stuff, but it doesn't prove him a Nazi.  He may just be stupid for using it, but it wasn't targeted to trigger anyone.  It doesn't matter if you're doing stuff like that for a meme, you know you have a young fan base.  It's not even funny in the first place, but you know the impact of making light of something like the Holocaust to young kids.  So the next thing, Ben Shapiro.  Ben Shapiro is a meme as well.  I actually know him only because of the memes.  PewDiePie invited him as part of the meme review, celebrities.  Again, it doesn't matter.  If you are inviting a horrible political figure on your show, a racist political figure, you can't just say he's a meme.  You don't get Donald Trump on and say he's a meme.  You don't get on some neo-Nazi and be like, oh, he's just a meme.  I'm just going to have him on because he's a meme.  I'm going to introduce him to millions of young people who are going to research this guy further and probably hop over to his channel as well.  Oh but it's just the meme.  so it's not political.  Of course it is, this is a stupid argument.  So the comment goes on, next the n-word thing, he used it in a high stress situation and everyone should know that these kinds of situations are different from normal thinking.  I use words in these situations I wouldn't use in normal conversations, not because I'm showing my true self in them, but my mind is in a kind of emergency mode and it works really chaotic during it.  PewDiePie is not a Nazi and 100% I'm not offended by his actions, that was stupid but not intended.  Okay, a high stress situation, you're just playing a first person shooter on your stream and you scream out the N word.  It's in your vocabulary if you're doing that.  If I'm playing a first person shooter and I'm stressed, I'm not gonna scream that out.  if someone kills me because it's just not in my vocabulary.  And if it's not in your vocabulary, you're not going to scream it out in high stress situations.  So whether or not, you know, he is a racist for saying that word, I believe he is extremely racially insensitive and going along with everything else we've seen about him, it wouldn't surprise me if he is generally racist.  But at the same time, it's not defensible to just be like, it was a chaotic moment and it was a high stress situation.  He wasn't in like a hostage situation.  He's playing a fucking video game.  So one PewDiePie fan went on to say that they don't hate the ADL because they're Jewish.  But he said it in the most anti-Semitic way, so get a load of this.  Marco Tuna said, \"...the ADL is the internet censorship mafia.  It doesn't matter that they have larger noses, even if they had more melanin in their skin or squintier eyes, that wouldn't change what they are doing.  They're a shit organisation regardless of the race of the people dishing out the  censorship.\".  why do you lefty types always care about race so much?  so yeah he just said a ton of anti-semitic stuff about jews having big noses and squinty eyes and then said he doesn't care about the race of the adl.  and he goes about saying that in the most anti-semitic way possible.  so someone else jumping on the adl stuff saying I don't understand this argument, right?  He has had numerous anti-Semitic controversies, but then these people are saying the reason he dropped the donation is because they did negative press against him and applauded Disney for dropping him.  right so he didn't know.  a charity that was for jewish causes liked that people were dropping him because he had numerous anti-semantic controversies.  this is what these people leave out.  they always say that adl is toxic fear-mongering and they applauded people for dropping him but they don't give the context.  of course they applauded people for dropping him.  he made jokes about the holocaust and the nazis.  Why would they not?  Is that unsurprising to any of them?  So I'll end reading out the comments with this last one.  So someone called Atak said, in summary, this guy has no sense of humour and over-analyses everything.  There is an episode of The Good Place, apparently eating a chicken sandwich means I hate gays.  This dude is seriously deranged, to which I replied, yes, chicken sandwich is the same as shouting out white supremacists, following them on Twitter, shouting racial slurs.  and making jokes about Nazis and the Holocaust.  So you read the insanity and the general delusion and racism of those comments.  Overall, being exposed to the fanbase for the first time properly really makes me lose hope in humanity a bit, especially because a lot of these people are young kids.  And you hope they will grow out of it.  But when you're sort of indoctrinated in a cult-like following.  I'm not saying it's like a proper cult.  But you know this following that you're so passionate about this guy.  You can't see that he's done anything wrong.  You can't see blatant racism.  You can't see anything wrong with all these things he's done.  But there was one guy who gave me a bit of hope.  I pinned this to the top of the comment section when he wrote it.  So a guy called Little Nate wrote... as much as i don't want to believe what he says everything he says here is correct.  pewdiepie has done many things.  that implies that he has some racist tendencies.  i love the man but you have to accept the facts here.  don't lie to yourself.  so i love this comment and it makes me kind of hopeful.  but this was actually the only comment i got out of the hundreds you know 800 plus of someone who was a fan who said, yeah, I agree, this is bad.  You know, we can't lie to ourselves and say that he doesn't have problems with racism.  And the fact that that was the only one, like I said, makes me lose hope in humanity.  And this is the biggest YouTuber on the platform.  He's ruining it for everyone.  He's making it easier for YouTube to justify being more corporate and sanitizing people, and especially the people like me who talk about more political and controversial topics.  It just really affects the platform in a negative way.  So overall, I hope this closes out the PewDiePie controversy and all the brigading done on my channel.  Let me know what you guys think in the comments.  Let me know what you think was the worst.  comment that people wrote, I think probably the first one, but I don't know if that was a troll comment just trying to piss me off or trying to maybe prove my point just for some sort of irony.
