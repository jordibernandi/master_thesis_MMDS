A few days ago, Carl Benjamin, Sargon of Akkad, made a response to my video titled The Nutpicking Fallacy, in which I used him as an example, and as a result, my video died.  Throughout, Carl expressed many points which I find fair, but I find those that he made regarding the nutpicking fallacy itself really quite off.  Now I personally think that the best way for us to move forward is to have a face-to-face conversation, and after talking with his secretary, I'm pleased to say that we've arranged to do exactly this.  We're recording on the 14th, and I'm sure the conversation will be published shortly after.  However, I do still think it's worth me responding in my typical format, as it lends itself very well to precision and clarification.  In a nutshell, I want you all to really understand my criticism before you watch us have a debate.  So here's how I'm going to approach this.  I'll begin by shortly clarifying the nutpicking fallacy itself, then I'll do my best to still manner confront Carl's objection, and then finally I'll address his less related points.  With that, let's get on with it.  And thanks for joining me.  And I'm not a communist. ",

The Fallacy of Composition is similar to the Fallacy of Nutpicking, and for this reason it's easy to confuse the two, but as Alex O'Connor commented, they are distinct.  The former occurs when one infers that something is true of a whole from the fact that it is true of some part of the whole.  For example, this brick is loose, therefore the wall itself is loose.  Whereas the fallacy of nutpicking occurs when one presents a non-typical proponent position or argument as if it or they are typical.  For example, this brick is loose, which is typical of bricks in this wall.  This is a fallacy, of course, because most bricks in this wall are not loose.  Or put another way, the fallacy of composition assigns a property of a part to the whole, while the fallacy of nutpicking assigns a property of a part to most other parts.  So yeah, these fallacies are similar, but they are importantly distinct.  Okay, with that covered, let's get to the main meal, your objection.  I'm going to address this in two parts, because I believe that some of your nuts have important attributes that some of your other nuts don't. ",

To put this in context of the former example, Lily Allen is a loose brick in the wall.  that is the left, but the fact that she's famous, say because she's a different colour or whatever, is absolutely irrelevant.  It's still fallacious to assert that her property of being unstable is typical of bricks that comprise the left.

You are helping spread the toxic narrative that only the most woke people are Left.  You are reinforcing the Left Pole.  You are helping our enemies.  But let's assume, for the sake of argument, which is to say that I know that this isn't your view, that Corbyn was not only the leader of the Labour Party, but was the leader of the entire left.  Let's assume that we had a world government, that absolutely everyone either sided left or right, and that Corbyn led the left.  How would this impact the fallacy of nutpicking?  it wouldn't.  The fact that a nut holds office is, like fame and influence, irrelevant.  If a nut holds a view that's not typical of the group that they lead, and you assert that it is by virtue of them being the leader, you are still committing the fallacy of nutpicking.  To again use the analogy of the wall, Corbyn might be the top brick of the now-shattered wall of labour, and he might even be a top brick in the much larger wall that is the Left, but the fact that he's the top brick doesn't somehow make it less fallacious to conflate his non-typical attributes with the bricks to which he sits upon.  Corbyn might have the deluded view that he won the argument, but it's not typical of people on the left to have this delusion.  Well, to once again give a counterexample, Donald Trump is a Presbyterian, but that doesn't mean that most members of the Republican Party are Presbyterian, let alone that the right is typically Presbyterian.  Trump is famous, has a lot of influence on social media, is very politically engaged, is in the news regularly, and he was elected.  And yet, it's still fallacious to assert that his attribute of being a Presbyterian is typical of individuals on the right.  It's got nothing to do with fame, influence, or office.  It has everything to do with whether the proposition is typical.  So even with your stronger examples, you are still guilty of nutpicking, Carl.

And so, again, the Olympics is yet another good case of the radical left losing ground because the wider left, such as people like myself, are calling them out.  The left said no to Corbyn, no to the ex-ACA board of directors, and no to making identity the sole qualifier to athletic categories.  The left is speaking, Carl.  But are you listening? ",

These days, everyone's group's biggest and brightest figures seem utterly preposterous.  However, and again, if the group to which they belong, or the group to which they lead, does not typically share one or more of their preposterous views, then it is a fallacy to assert that they do.  This is why David Pakman is correct to say that their fringe views are not typical of the left.  Lily Allen's misandry, Michael Moore's racism, and Corbyn's delusions are not typical of left-leaning individuals, and so it is a fallacy to assert that it is. ",
