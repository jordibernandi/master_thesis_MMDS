A lot of times we see Yang just, you know, very nicely in a very nice way, correcting a bunch of people, right?  Well, this time he's with Larry Lessig and... People all the time in the comment section want to say, like, I don't trust him, or how do you know he's being truthful, or anything like that.  Like, when's the last time you've seen a real politician tear up in a genuine fashion, at genuine questions, about being genuinely motivated for what he's doing?  When's the last time that's happened?  I mean, when you see Rachel Maddow, she's not really a politician, but she's over here crying about, you know, russia and stuff like that.  but like this guy really is like he's tearing up over some real issues that he really wants to fix.  so i'm gonna get off here real quick.  so you guys see this clip.  uh so and i'll catch you on the other side.  so let's go ahead and roll that.

All of them go to Congress, I think, whether you agree with their policies or not, for the right reasons.  They're all trying to do good.  But then they find themselves in the middle of the system that forces them, if they're going to survive, to behave like this.  And so I think one really important thing is to stop vilifying people as if they're evil people and just take on the system, which I think is the interesting perspective of somebody like an entrepreneurial person.  entrepreneur brings to this type of question?  Because you look at problems and you think what's the twist that might make this problem go away? ",

You're looking up and you're seeing that there's something twisted and messed up and imperfect about various processes, certainly campaign finance.  And it's very tempting to then demonize people on the other end of it.  And sometimes they're doing really unsavory things.  But what we have to do is we have to focus on fixing the system that is distorting and dehumanizing various people, turning them into economic actors very, very often.  That is the mission that we all must be on.  You all have this almost sacred trust to try and safeguard the rest of the country from this broken down system that is on the verge of pushing us off this precipice after which there will be no coming back.  And you can all feel it.  Like we're all heading in that direction.  That's why I'm running for president.  I'm not running for president because I fantasized about ever being president.  I'm running for president because I'm an American and I'm a parent and I can see the country we will leave to our children.  And it is not something that I'm willing to accept. ",

Just because he's so genuine.  People want to say, yeah, I don't trust him.  Well, how could you not?  You know, he hasn't done anything... remotely close to what our day-to-day politicians who's already running has done.  so he's 10 times more trustworthy than anybody out there as far as I'm concerned next to the person that he's sitting next to which I voted for last time around but that's neither here nor there because Leslie isn't running and the injury is so you ain't getting all the way.  baby all right let's keep on going guys all right and I'll see you guys in the next one.
