The Devil's Stone is largely ignored here.  There's only one day of the year anyone pays any attention to it and that is today, the 5th of November.  Normally a day associated with gunpowder, treason and plot.  But in this village in Devon, it's associated instead with a stone.  They have lit it up and there's a whole large gathering which you can't see in the darkness over there, eating pork and drinking beer and preparing to heave the stone and turn it over, as they have every year on this date since before records began.  Some books I have read from the 19th century claim that this tradition dates back to Anglo-Saxon times, the turning of the devil's stone.  But the truth is, we simply don't know why it is done or when it started to be done.  All we can say is that the locals have believed, since before people can remember, that if they don't turn this stone over tonight, every year, then the devil will come.  And even the local pub, is named after this stone, the Devil's Stone.  So, thanks to the strong lads of this village who will come soon enough, we can be certain that the devil will not plague these lovable children. ",

So yeah, it's grown as the years have gone.  And the numbers have grown as well, enormously.  This is Sheffield.  Not for us any fantastical fun of Guy Fawkes night.  Not for us the burning of bonfire.  or the fun of fireworks.  Not for us the almost destruction of Parliament.  And nor for us a great big birthday celebration, even if this is your day.  Happy birthday if it is.  For this is Shebiah and in Shebiah we turn the stone on the 5th of November.  Tradition we go back to.  Tradition that goes back into the mysteries of the centuries of time.  For the Bible tells us that the devil thought he could have all things for himself.  He rose up in heaven.  He thought he could be in control.  But God said, no.  The archangel Michael was sent to cast him out with his angelic host.  Imagine the scene.  The battle is lost.  The devil must go.  It's part of the cost.  But not now, he pleads.  An extension, please.  Flexible, if you like.  But go, he must.  And so, at last... The devil is cast out from heaven Cast from heaven to earth below But not to die in a ditch.  That's North Loo Trapped by a stone, that's how he's brought low.  But even then, still his wiles seep out from below.  He's trapped, he may be, but still his secret deals are there for each of us.  to be tempted by.  Resist him to resist those secret thoughts that come, that entice us so.  Those visions that never quite work out.  Those words that so easily harm.  We need God's help still each day.  And so we come with Church of Michael here behind us.  We come once more to seek the power from above.  We come as a sign to turn the stone once more this year.  And so, people of Shebia and beyond, Let us call upon ringers strong to once again turn the stone.  Let's cry, turn the stone, turn the stone, turn the stone.  from the stone from the stone from the stone from the stone come on.  It comes out of a story in the Bible, in the book of Revelation, of the devil being cast out of heaven.  And if you like, it's Easter, the other end of the year.  But so many places on hilltops were associated with Michael, the archangel, with a battle with Satan.  St.  Michael's Mount down in Cornwall is a classic example.  Brentore is another just down the road from here.  So here we're up on a hill.  It's St Michael's Church.  There's a stone which doesn't belong.  It's a glacial moraine.  So presumably it was bought here in glacial times.  It doesn't fit with the geology of the area.  So stories become associated.  Maybe there was a particular incident or something.  Who knows? ",
