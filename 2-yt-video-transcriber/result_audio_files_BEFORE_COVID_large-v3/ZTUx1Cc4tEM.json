            "text": "I'll tell you, last night, Thursday night, the 7th, I was watching Rachel Maddow's program and she had a few excerpts from the very soon to be published book, Warning, by the same person who wrote the anonymous column in the Washington Post back earlier this year.  And what she quoted from the book was just, at once scary, unbelievable, and just reinforced a couple of things for me.  First of all, why the Republicans haven't agreed to remove this bastard even sooner, if at all, for Republicans, and replace him with a Republican.  I don't give a shit if they replace him with a Republican.  Just get this monster out of there.  I don't know why they haven't done it.  And the other thing that I came to realize is just how fucked up.  Donald Trump really is.  It's not just gibberish rhetoric now on the part of people like me who think he is a criminal, know he's a criminal, but people who are right there with him who see this behavior.  The other thing I can't understand, there have been so many decent people who have worked close to him as advisors or chiefs of staff or what have you.  And once they get out, because the madness is too thick you can't even breathe, why don't they come out and say, I'm General So-and-so.  This is what I saw.  This man is insane.  I don't understand this omerta, this mafia, well, this Italian thing.  Omerta, silence.  You don't say anything.  I do not get that.  And then today, Friday, earlier today, when he gave one of his impromptu press conferences as he's walking towards the helicopter to come here, for Christ's sake, to Atlanta.  He's coming to Atlanta to win over the black vote.  Atlanta, Georgia, which arguably is location central for the Civil Rights Movement, and this bloated pig is coming here.  I guess he has scheduled events in black churches, and I would think that any black church that would allow this racist pig to come into their sanctuary, I'm shocked.  I'm absolutely shocked.  I understand the civil rights attitude, the traditional Christian attitude from the civil rights workers, the civil rights leaders.  You know, okay, he's our enemy, but you have to reach out the hand of fellowship even to your enemy.  Turn the other cheek, Jesus said, so on and so forth.  Okay, that's fine.  Maybe 2,000 years ago, but we're here now.  We're here now.  We have Trump.  We have this animalistic bastard Trump who will say anything to black folk, white folk, green folk, it doesn't matter who, and he's a liar and a deceiver.  He is satanic.  I mean, he is, as long as we're going to put a religious twist on all this bullshit.  But I digress.  He was on the sidewalk or whatever the hell it is with the helicopter waiting to whisk him away to Andrews so he could come and pollute Atlanta.  And he had one of his infamous little press conferences.  And he's degenerating.  He's losing his fucking mind.  Did you hear any of that, Kathy, on MSNBC?  Oh, my God.  It's just... No, I can't repeat any of it.  I just stood there, though, and watched this stunned, listening to him... repeat himself over and over again.  And everybody's a criminal and everybody is corrupt and everybody is fake, except him and his fucked up family.  They're all out to get him.  Even Gordon Sondland, even eventually Giuliani.  You watch, this paranoid son of a bitch is going to try to throw everybody in the creek.  I wonder if they'll go willingly.  I've never seen such stuff, but I can tell you this.  He is slowly, and maybe not so slowly, disintegrating.  Oh, he's bloating up.  The camera was real close on his face.  And this guy is developing lizard skin.  It's just, I don't know what's going on.  But if you saw that, the skin, his skin, it's lizard skin.  And you would think that a billionaire like Donald Trump, of course he's not one, but to buy into his fantasy, that he could afford to get someone to either fix his hair so he looks human.  instead of that arrow thing he has going, you know, just with the duck's ass in the back and the platform out front.  It looks like he's constantly moving.  with the wind, you know what I'm saying?  Maybe his precious daughter, Ivanka, could come up with somebody who could come in and fix Dada's hair.  But taken together, his lizard skin, his bulbous body, his horrible hair, and the things he is saying, you come up with a classic mid-20th century resident of an asylum.  It's just hard to understand how this guy is still in office. ",
