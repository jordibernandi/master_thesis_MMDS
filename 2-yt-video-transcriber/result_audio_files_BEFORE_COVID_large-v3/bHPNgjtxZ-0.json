Bill Barr has indicated he's going to get to the bottom of this, and it is important that we do find out how this all started.  I always go back to this, Maria.  January 3rd, 2017, then the highest ranking official in the United States Congress, Senator Chuck Schumer, said this about President-elect Trump.  He said, you mess with the intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you.  And the question is, did that really play out?  Was the intelligence community targeting the Trump campaign, targeting the Trump, then President-elect Trump and the Trump administration?  Bill Barr wants to find out, and I think he's going to do it, and I applaud him for doing so. ",

We already know about all that.  So spying, as Bill Barr said under oath, spying definitely occurred.  The question is, was there a proper predicate?  And it sure looks like there wasn't.  I would also point people to, your viewers, to look at Emmet Flood's letter that he sent to the Attorney General last week, where he talks about this same fundamental issue.  He says, in this great country, unelected people in the bureaucracy, in the executive branch, answer to the elected guy.  they answer to the president not the other way around.  and that is critical when you take chuck schumer statement and in the floods letter where he points out that point.  this is scary and this is why it's so important that bill barr and michael horowitz get to the bottom of this and report to the american.

So I think they're nervous about Bill Barr, because remember what he said three weeks ago in front of the Senate Finance Committee.  He made four important points.  First of all, he said spying did, in fact, take place.  Second, he said there is a basis for his concern that the spy wasn't properly predicated.  Third, he said there was a failure of leadership at the upper echelon of the FBI.  We know that's for sure.  Comey, McCabe, Baker, Strzok, Page, we know there was a failure of leadership there.  And then fourth, he used two terms.  that I've never really heard before.  And my guess is most Americans haven't.  He used the term unauthorized surveillance and he used the term political surveillance.  So the Democrats are scared.  And frankly, I think when we're talking about obstruction of justice, the real obstruction of justice is what Democrats are trying to do to the attorney general.  They're trying to stop him by all these things, this contempt and not having him come testify.  They're trying to stop him from getting the answers that we just talked about. ",
