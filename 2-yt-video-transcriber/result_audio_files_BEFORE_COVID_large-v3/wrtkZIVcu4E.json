            "text": "Hello all, welcome to the Truth Show.  In this video, I will be talking about Dwayne Wade and of course, Gabrielle Union and more.  Let's talk.  Here we go again.  I mean, this is the Truth Show and there's more.  Oh, I'm not done yet.  Oh, and there's more.  Oh, I'm not done yet.  I mean, this is the Truth Show.  Oh, yes.  I know I'm very late with this, but there seems to have have been a slip-up from Dwyane Wade pertaining to his son, Zion.  But before I get into that, we need to go back, back to his ex-wife.  Oh, and many of you may not like this video, but please note that I am not trying to be mean.  I am merely analyzing the situation.  With that being said, we need to go back, back to his ex-wife.  Have any of you heard about the drama with Dwyane Wade, ex-wife Siobhan Fuches?  It's like there's a whole new life before this sudden halo image that Gabrielle Union created over him that many of us don't know about.  Well, I'm going to talk about it.  Okay, we should all know that Dwyane Wade in 2002 married his high school sweetheart, Sayovan Funches, I hope I pronounced her name correctly, with whom he had two sons by.  Zaire, who was born in 2001, and Zion, who was born in 2007.  The couple divorced in 2010, with Wade obtaining full custody of Zaire and Zion for the following year.  It was told that he divorced his wife because he was secretly seeing Gabrielle Union, along with many other women, and word on the streets some men too.  Hector Horny basketball player even fathered another son, Xavier, in 2013 while he was still dating Gabrielle Union.  But I guess in the midst of all of his playing, 42-year-old at the time, Gabrielle still married him in 2014. meanwhile dwayne wade ex-wife had published a tell-all book spilling secrets from their past relationship.  it seems that dwayne had cheated a lot.  no big surprise.  he was also violent and more.  she also admitted that she had became an arrogant diva meaning she subjected herself by ways of ignoring her other many talents to fit in with the nba wives club And she began to, you know, love money.  And then their marriage fell apart.  She even revealed that there was one time an unnamed mistress called her at 3 a.m.  to boast about her rendezvous with Wade and even described the underwear he had on.  Oh, yes.  Oh, she wasn't done.  She went on to say that living with Wade in Miami was like living in a $4 million prison.  and allege that a former teammate of Wade's with the Miami Heat suggested that she have an affair right after a game while still inside a Miami Heat arena.  She ended up losing custody of their sons.  He also raises his nephew, who's the son of his sister Deanna.  However, the inside details of this custody agreement will shock you.  Okay.  Now, as some of you may have heard, there was an agreement for her to receive $1 million, plus $25,000 in child support.  But here's the tea.  Ms.  Wade did an interview a while back exposing the discrepancies in that report slash rumor about this alleged settlement agreement.  The interviewer.  had asked her about the settlement and more and she said this there has been no settlement period not even close to the 25k a month reported either.  as a matter of fact mr wade is frequently late on the items he is supposed to pay for.  i've recently received a notice about the mortgage on my chicago home being behind 75 000 and my car insurance has been canceled.  The interviewer asked her, was she working?  She said, I'm currently in law school.  The course doesn't really allow for me to have a full-time job.  She went on to ask, was law school always a goal?  Or did she come to this following the issues she had with her lawyers during the case?  Anyway, she said, it has been something I wanted to do.  I put my life on hold.  When Mr.  Wade's career took off, I raised our son.  Even now, Mr.  Wade, is practicing alienation with our children.  He's trying to prevent me from seeing my sons on Mother's Day this weekend.  Usually the boys fly to Chicago to spend it with me, but this year Mr.  Wade wants to change that.  Then the interviewer asks the most curious question.  Why do you think he wants to alienate your sons from you?  What is all the animosity steaming from?  It's all about control.  He wants to control me.  That's what abusers do.  And it's about money.  He wants to create the image of a good family guy for his sponsors who would do anything for money.  And then the interviewer asked if there is a way that you and Dwayne can come together and co-parent without being so reliant on courts and lawyers.  If yes, what are those steps in your mind?  If he retains custody, would you consider moving back to Miami to be closer to your sons?  She said, Move to Miami for what?  He won't let me see my sons now, so there's no reason to believe he would if I was in Miami full time.  And it's reached a point now where my oldest son doesn't want to visit at all.  My youngest has been told I don't want to see them.  The other day, he got on the phone with me and said he was told that I didn't want to come see him.  I have finals.  I'm trying to grow as a person.  Mr.  Wade is vindictive.  and he's trying to turn my sons against me.  I paid out of my own pocket for a mediator to try to resolve the issues.  The session was set and Mr.  Wade just didn't show up.  No excuse, no call.  I've made the effort.  What happened to all of your lawyers?  The interviewer asked.  She said, I can't really go into details about that right now, but I would say that when you aren't the one paying the bill, things can get interesting.  How accountable do you hold yourself in the demise of your marriage?  The interviewer asked.  She said, I'm honest about the mistakes I made in the past.  Are you still in love with Dwayne?  The interviewer asked.  She said, I moved on in my life.  I'm not interested in talking about love or anything like that.  The interviewer then asks the really tough question, with Gabriel Union being a seemingly permanent fixture in Dwayne's life.  Do you see a time that you two could be friendly or develop some sort of relationship since she plays a role in your son's lives?  She said, I'm not answering any question on Ms.  Union.  Now judging from these answers, it seems that Ms.  Wade has accepted her loss and is trying to move on with her life.  Dwayne has literally erased Ms.  Wade from his life and their son's life.  He do seem like he's very controlling.  And he's definitely dominating the situation and just treating her like crap, literally.  He's treating her like shit.  Sounds like he hate her fucking guts.  And he probably don't even know why, but that's what it looks like.  His true character is being shown when he's with her.  And Gabrielle Yoon is merely like she said.  A great front for his sponsors and money.  I'm sure there's love there, but let's be realistic here.  Anyway, but I'm not sure, however, if his idea or was it Gabrielle's idea for them to just stop being affiliated with Ms.  Wade.  I don't know if that was like a joining idea to keep her away from the kids and them.  That don't sound like Gabrielle Union, but I've heard some mean things about her as well, but I don't know if they're true or not.  But yeah, I have heard them.  I've heard a lot of bad things about Dwayne and it wasn't even just from his ex-wife.  It's from basketball players, people on the street, ex-girlfriends, and none of them are saying anything nice about him seriously.  and these women are.  they have money so it's not like it's some kind of you know propaganda or you know something like that.  they just don't have anything back to say.  they say he's a very heartless and cold dude.  he only cares about his money and his career and his kids.  kids come somewhere in that list but they're not on the top list and that's just the truth.  they say he's kind of soulless.  that's what i'm hearing but Who knows?  I don't know.  Anyway, but I'm going to say judging from how he's acting toward, you know, the mother of his kids is making what she said in her book more plausible and true.  However, that doesn't make her innocent at all in any of this.  With more research, Ms.  Wade received over $5 million plus an $80,000 BMW and two homes.  she received in this 2013 settlement that she gave away.  She's now repeatedly trying to overturn the settlement, but considering the state of Wade and not to mention him being married to Gabrielle and the sudden halo over his head, it doesn't look good for her.  Heck, she even did a someone protest claiming that Dwayne Wade left her out on the street.  She also said that she only received three months of child support in six years.  However, truth be told, she doesn't have custody of the kids now.  So I'm assuming this was before she lost custody.  Furthermore, she did reveal more.  She also claimed that she received $300,000 a year, which is about $25,000 a month.  Well, it seems that this isn't enough because the unstable ex-wife that once accused Wade of giving her an STD and being unfaithful and being a gun lover, a drug and alcohol abuser and not properly taking care of his children on top of everything else is now claiming to be homeless.  But this is coming from a woman that was charged with attempted child abduction and resisting arrest late last year.  But that could be explained by saying she was simply a mother who missed her kids.  Now that we got that out of the way, let's talk about the reveal of his son being gay or not.  Me being a woman of equality and believing that every man and woman, boy or girl, should be created equally regardless of race, sexual choices, and more.  With that being said, there was a study taken on why gays are gay.  Were they born with it or was it just thrust upon them?  Well, here are the study answers.  Okay, they were sexually abused as a child which left them traumatized and sexually confused.  They were raised around women and was often treated like one.  They didn't have a father and or male figure in their lives, which left them psychologically confused about sex and found desires in obscene and peculiar ways.  They did have both figures in their lives, but their father or mother was more of a dictator and her or his mother or father was more nurturing toward the opposite sex or person of the opposite sex.  which left him or her psychologically and emotionally starved in wishing he or she was who their parent wanted or treated better.  That desire turned from wishing to need to desperately and obsessively wanting to be, to later becoming that person, even years after the parent is long dead.  They received more sex chromosomes from Their father or mother, instead of getting the equal amount, despite being born with male or female body parts, which left them only attracted to the same sex because that's what they desired.  They were the opposite sex in the before life, hence reincarnation.  You never know.  Maybe someone was a male in the before life and as a female, they're attracted to women and vice versa.  Um, anyway, they was merely trying to belong to the crowds and be cool.  I mean, it's the end thing now to be gay.  And last but not least, because they want to be damn it.  That's my favorite.  However, back to Dwayne Wade, 12 year old son, Zion, who at some time now has been showing signs of being gay.  It seems that the ways have received a lot of criticism after they supported Zion at the pride festival.  earlier in a year.  Then there was the picture that he posted captioning my girls.  It was in a podcast where he said, I had to look myself in the mirror and say, what if your son come home and tell you he's gay?  What are you going to do?  You're talking about strength and courage.  My 12 year old son has more than I have.  You can learn something from your kids.  In our household, that's all we talk about.  We talk about making sure our kids are seen by us.  We want them to be whoever they feel they can be in this world.  That's our goal.  He also added, while you're trying to go down a process, this is what's going to come at you.  It's going to be a lot of negativity.  It's going to be a lot of hate.  And it's not even just from kids.  My son's sexuality is just about being a young black man or a black woman, right?  When I respond to things socially, I'm not responding because you're hurting my feelings.  Why I'm responding is because I understand my platform.  I understand that I'm speaking for a lot of people that don't have the same voice that I have.  He also went on record saying in a post talking about the criticism about his Thanksgiving post.  This is what he said.  I've seen... some post thanksgiving hate on social about my family photo.  stupidity is a part of this world we live in so i get it.  but here's the thing i've been chosen to lead my family not y'all.  So we will continue to be us, support each other with pride, love, and a smile.  He went on to say, so for me, it's my version of supporting.  It ain't about him.  He knows who he is.  It's about you.  Who are you?  All these people that out there saying those things, look at yourself.  Understand that you, you are the one that got the issues.  You're the one that got the problems.  It's not the kids.  You decide that, yeah, they're born a certain way and you say they got to be that way.  That's not life.  I watched my son from day one become into who she now eventually come into.  Nothing changes with my love.  Nothing changes with my responsibilities.  The only thing that I have to do now is get smarter and educate myself more.  Now, I'm going to say, upon doing my research, I did see some questionable photos with his son and his other sons.  Also saw some with him and his son that I look with suspected eyes.  But I'm not going to say it on here because that would really piss you guys off.  I mean, I could piss away anything.  These aren't rantings, however, of a confusing bit of person because I'm none of those things.  This is coming from someone to his eye.  I'm talking about myself.  I'm the witness.  The witness firsthand of a young boy being molested and raped as a baby to his childhood.  Yeah, until he became a little older by his father, brothers, etc.  Of course, he was drugged and he was too young to understand or remember most of it.  Thankfully, his father is in jail now for a long time for raping other kids.  However, later this young boy became gay.  Not saying this for all gays, I'm only speaking of this particular situation.  Man, I've witnessed so many things that I was told to overlook and that I was only imagining things that later turned out.  I was correct and should have said something.  I told myself on my recent birthday this year that I won't do that anymore.  If I receive criticism, oh well, don't care.  Hell, most of my high viewed videos are my most hated, even if they are the truth.  You see, I strike a nerve in people.  I show them the truth.  And that can be scary to many people.  The truth hurts.  Even I can say that.  Just saying.  Anyway, that's it.  Let me know your thoughts below.  And again.  Thank you.  Thank you. ",
