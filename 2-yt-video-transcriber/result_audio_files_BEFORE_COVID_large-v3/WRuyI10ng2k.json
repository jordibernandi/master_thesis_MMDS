            "text": "Hey welcome back reluctant preppers and Finance and Liberty viewers.  Well this doesn't sound like our usual background does it?  Because this is no set.  This is no gag.  This is the real deal.  I was on the walk this morning walking our dogs with my lovely wife Melody and started having fainting like spells and memory lapses and after a few more bouts of that during the morning we ended up landing here at a hospital.  near our home and getting checked out.  Several tests today and more to come tomorrow.  Trying to figure out if this was some kind of a warning stroke or what this was and we don't know yet.  So the jury is still out on that.  but just wanted to let you know that instead of being able to bring you what I wanted to bring you, which was our interview with Danielle DiMartino Booth this evening.  And we also have several others lined up already with David Morgan and others that we're going to have a little interruption here.  So at least I wanted to reach out to you and let you know that this is your Friday night video for this week.  And perhaps we've been learning today and a lesson we can all take is that that sometimes life throws you a curve that you're not expecting.  So not to take one day for granted, but instead to treasure each day, be there with your family and to have a plan B. In this case, my wife was able to bring me here and we've got a lot of people pulling for us and ask you to as well.  And thank you for your prayers and we'll be back with you as soon as we can, as soon as we know what's necessary to get me back in the saddle.  and get us back on the air with you and our guests.  So thanks for being there for us everybody and look forward to being able to bring you next episodes of Finance and Liberty and Reluctant Preppers as soon as we get back in the business.  Thanks guys.  Take care. ",
