            "text": "I am Michael Pearl.  You're at the door, and I'm here to answer your Bible questions.  These are questions you sent in to us.  If you have a question, you can send it to us, and he'll tell you where.  I don't know.  All right, so here's the question, and this is by a guy named Brandon.  Brandon says, what is blasphemy against the Holy Spirit?  That's been asked quite a bit.  You know, the Bible always has the answer.  You just have to read it.  Now, I'm going to read the two verses where it's mentioned.  And then I'm going to read the context.  Here's the passage.  Wherefore I say unto you, all manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men.  But the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men.  Whosoever speaketh the word against the Son of Man, it shall be forgiven him.  But whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him.  Neither in this world, neither in the world to come.  Now, if you just take it right out of context and read it as I just did.  You don't know what it is.  You'd have to say, well, what does the word blaspheme mean?  Well, the word blaspheme means to speak derogatorily of that which is sacred, to tear down that which is sacred, to speak of it as if it were not sacred, to defame that which is sacred is to blaspheme.  The word's used quite a few times in the Bible in reference to individuals who blasphemed or were accused of blasphemy.  It was the worst thing that you could accuse a Jew of.  because the penalty of it was death.  So here's the context.  Matthew 12, 22.  Then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil, blind and dumb, and he healed him.  In so much the blind and the dumb both spake and saw.  And all the people were amazed and said, Is this not the son of David?  When the Pharisees heard it, they said, This fellow doth not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub, the prince of the devils.  So when they saw Jesus casting out devils, they said, no, that's not God doing that.  That's the devil working through him to do that.  Jesus knew their thoughts and said, every kingdom bad against itself is brought to desolation.  And he says a few more things.  He says, if Satan cast out Satan, his kingdom is divided against itself.  And how shall it stand?  And if Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your children cast them out?  Therefore they shall be your judges.  But if I cast out devils by the spirit of God, the kingdom of God has come unto you.  Or else how can one enter into a strong man's house and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man to Jesus.  Couldn't go in and buy and take the devil's goods, which is what he's been doing when he cast the devils out, except he first bind the strong man, which would be the devil.  In other words, the devil couldn't give him power to go against the devil.  That would be a nonsensical.  He that is not with me is against me.  He that gathers not with me scatters abroad.  Therefore, I say unto you, all manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto you.  But the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto you who serve.  Therefore, speaketh a word against the Son of Man.  It shall be forgiven him.  So Jesus raises the severity level of this by saying, hey, you can talk against me all you want to.  You can say I was an illegitimately born child.  You can say that I'm just an ordinary human being.  say anything you want to about me.  It'll be forgiven you.  But you say something against the Holy ghost in terms of blasphemy, and it won't be forgiven.  Now the passage goes on.  after verse 32, he says either make the tree good and his fruit good or else make the tree corrupt and his fruit corrupt for the tree is known best fruit.  Oh, generation of vipers.  So he's talking to this crowd of religious leaders.  And he calls them a generation of vipers.  In other words, he said, your mama was a snake and you're a baby snake, a whole bunch of baby snakes.  That's kind of, I mean, that's even Trump wouldn't even talk that way.  He said, oh, generation of vipers.  How can you being evil speak good things?  for out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaketh.  Uh, a good man out of the good treasured heart bring forth good things.  An evil man out of the evil treasure brings forth evil things.  I send you that every idle word.  So this was about speaking every idle word that men shall speak.  They shall give account there of the day of judgment.  So you could blaspheme with idle words.  Or by the words thou shall be justified.  And by the words thou shalt be condemned.  What Jesus has said here is that someone could idly with indifference speak against the Holy Ghost.  And it will not be forgiven them in this life or the next.  Now, are there people who cannot be forgiven walking around on this planet that are lost and damned and can never be saved?  Yes, there are.  I think probably abortion doctors who stand there and suck babies out of the womb, I doubt they could ever be brought to God.  People that molest children, I doubt that they could ever be brought to God.  Maybe they could, I don't know.  But there are things that people do that sear their conscience so badly that they'll never come to God, according to Jesus, that is.  Now there's another chapter in Mark where he addresses the same subject.  It's the same event.  Mark gives a shorter account of it and adds a phrase at the end of it that's significant to the story.  Now observe what I'm doing.  I just take the Bible, look at the context, and look every time the word blaspheme is used, which we're not going to do, but I've done that, in the Bible, and then let the Bible speak for itself.  It's that simple.  And you don't need a commentary.  You don't need me.  If you'd read your Bible, King James, that is.  And the scribes, which came down from Jerusalem said he has Beelzebub.  And by the Prince of devils, he cast out devils.  So these were special scribes that came down from Jerusalem.  This was a religious delegation.  They had on the finest clothes and they stood with their heads up real high.  And they always had this real stern look and they conferred one with another.  And you see them nodding a lot.  And he called unto them and said unto them in parables, how can Satan cast out Satan?  If a kingdom be divided against itself, the kingdom should not stand.  If a house be divided against itself, the house cannot stand.  If Satan rise up against himself and be divided, he cannot stand, but hath an end.  No man can enter into a strong man's house and spoil his goods, except he bind the strong man first, and then he will spoil his house.  Very last thing to you, he says it again, all sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men.  And blasphemies wherewith, so ever they shall blaspheme.  He said, I'll forgive all sins and all blasphemies, but he that shall blaspheme against the Holy ghost has never forgiveness, but is in tank in danger of eternal damnation because they said he has an unclean spirit.  So that clearly defines what blasphemy is.  It's not saying something bad about Jesus or God.  It's taking the work that the Holy ghost does and saying the work of the Holy ghost is the work of devils.  It's looking at Christianity and saying the spirit of God that those people claim to have is really the spirit of Satan.  And that Christians are not moved by the Spirit of God.  They're not led by the Spirit of God.  They're led by another spirit, an evil spirit.  That's blasphemy.  Not against Christ or God, but against the Holy Spirit himself.  Now, the question is, do people just inadvertently, accidentally, casually do this and wham, you know, cross the line, never come back?  I don't think that's what he's saying, he said there that by every idle word that you speak, by your words you'll be justified, by your words you'll be condemned.  From the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks.  So what I think we're seeing here is that those words spoken, even casually by an individual, express a heart that's already estranged from God and distant from God.  A heart that's in rebellion, a heart that sees the wonders that God's doing, the Holy Spirit's doing.  And rejects it to the point of saying, no, the devil did it.  And so, no, they cannot be forgiven, not in this world and not in the world to come.  They had a guy, one to me one time, he asked him if he was on the street and I asked him if he won't trust crisis savior.  And he said, I can't, I said, why not?  He said, I blast him against the Holy ghost.  And I said, well, if you hadn't blast him against the Holy ghost, would you like to be saved tonight?  He said, well, no.  I said, well, you're right, you can't be saved unless you want to be.  If you ever decide you want to be and you want to come to Christ, you want to call upon him and you want to be forgiven, he's waiting, he'll receive you.  You see, no one can know that they've committed that sin.  For sure, no one can know.  I can't know in another individual if they committed that sin.  But if you live your life against the work of the Holy Spirit of God, there will come a day when you will know.  Never too late until it is.  And it's up to you to decide when it's too late.  Nobody decides it for you.  You decide that God is not making something happen.  He's responding to what you're doing.  You're the initiator.  He's the respondent here.  Okay.  That's answer to that question. ",
