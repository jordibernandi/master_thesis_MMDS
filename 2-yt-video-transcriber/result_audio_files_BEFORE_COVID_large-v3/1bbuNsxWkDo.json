In all of my years of doing this channel, I've managed it once.  And we were thinking, if we find some pants that are maybe too tight or some yoga pants, should we get in touch with you and let you know? ",

And knowing that I wouldn't be able to have a serious conversation without him hanging up, I just thought I'd rib him a little bit.  But it's very difficult to have that sort of conversation with a governing body member, whether you're an apostate like me or not, especially now they're in Warwick.  It's even harder to have a chance encounter with someone who claims to be part of God's channel with 8.5 million Jehovah's Witnesses.  It's almost impossible.  So you can imagine my surprise when yesterday I had an email from someone saying, you will never guess who I ran into at my local liquor store and I managed to document it.  So I needed to find out more.  An email exchange ensued.  I managed to get the video footage on condition that I disguise the man's voice.  So without further ado, here it is.  I see you're a fan of scotch.  Do you know anything about Irish whiskey?  Yeah. ",

It warned about homosexual men who prey on and advocate the right to use boys for sex.  Shame on them.  It is one thing to work on a job with others and quite another matter to immerse oneself in an institution of learning.  If your hands are not clean because you've been out warning, then they have blood on them, and you're going to lose your life.  So this is it.  At this point, we're confident to share with you.  Russia and its allies are the king of the north.  Jehovah blesses obedience.  This is a theocracy ruled by God, not a collection of man-made decisions.  This is governed from heaven. ",

            "text": "and yet for all that arrogance and judgmentalism and pomposity wouldn't you know our boy tony is just a normal guy?  after all who you could argue and i've repeatedly argued is entirely unworthy of the attention and adoration that's lavished on him.  here is a guy who can get caught out wandering round a booze-store at eleven o'clock on a sunday morning which is when this was recorded.  Now, before going into this in too much detail, because there's plenty of detail I can share with you, it would probably be best to go straight to an email from the guy who recorded this because he provided lots of background.  It says, so here is the play-by-play.  I entered the store without my cell phone intending to buy a bottle of Irish whiskey.  i was completely surprised to see him and even doubted at first that it was him.  i left the store and returned with my phone.  the frames as i approached him show his cart with about a dozen bottles of macallan scotch very pricey in the states.  The red boxes in the cart are the Macallan cut.  We chatted a bit.  I bought a bottle of cheap whisky that apparently his wife approves of.  I also have two more videos of him at the register and loading it into his Cadillac which we've seen.  My impression was that he has done this many times before.  he removed the bottles from their boxes before going to the register a security protocol at this store also he had them throw away the individual boxes which to me shows that he wasn't purchasing them as gifts.  i left feeling kind of sad for him someone at the helm of a billion-dollar publishing concern out alone on a sunday morning buying a ton of expensive scotch.  Then I thought how the rank and file are actually the ones funding this soiree and how he doesn't miss an opportunity to make them feel bad for not doing more.  I hope you can include this in your videos at some point.  I did.  I really enjoy your viewpoints and would love to see your take on this.  P.S.  Why isn't he at a meeting or in service at 11 a.m.  on a Sunday?  That is an interesting question.  Because bear in mind, I checked where this liquor store is, and it's actually the Bottle King store on, let's see, Bottle King on Route 17 in Ramsey, New Jersey, which I've checked.  It's a 23-minute store.  drive out from the Warwick headquarters and my contact tells me that there's plenty of liquor stores in and around the headquarters within a short drive.  but for some reason he wanted to drive out that distance to this particular store to buy what we're going to find is very expensive whiskey.  but he was doing all this on a Sunday morning.  So while he was wandering around a booze store, up and down the Eastern Seaboard, there were congregations or there are congregations who would have been at their kingdom halls attending the public talk or sitting through the Watchtower study.  It's a very odd state of affairs that while they were doing that... A man they look upon as part of the faithful and discreet slave was in a booze store stocking up on very expensive Scotch whiskey.  And you might ask, well, how expensive?  Well, my contact, again, he managed to catch very briefly a still of the contents of the shopping cart.  And he says that there were six bottles of Macallan cut and six bottles of Macallan 12-year.  This is single malt Scotch whiskey.  And I actually went on the Booze King website because I wanted the most accurate price possible.  These are whiskeys that are apparently on offer at the moment.  The 12-year is priced at $52.99 a bottle, making six bottles $317.94.  The Macallan Cut is priced at $89.99 on sale per bottle, making six bottles of that $539.94.  For the 12 bottles in question, and bear in mind it looks to me as though there's more than just those bottles in the shopping cart, the single malt comes to $857.88.  Now, I think it's important to say at this point that we don't know why he was buying the whiskey.  Despite what my contact says, we can't be certain of who the whiskey was intended for.  All we know for sure is that at around 11 a.m.  yesterday on Sunday, Tony Morris was buying at least 12 bottles of very, very expensive single malt.  And the bare minimum I think you can ask is, well, first of all, that's an odd activity for a governing body member on a Sunday morning.  But second of all, does it really have to be that expensive and in that quantity?  You know, one bottle, okay.  Two bottles, okay.  $12?  Very odd.  And where's the $850 coming from?  You could argue.  But more than anything, what really hits me when I watch this footage is I see a sad man waddling around in sneakers and a trench coat and a flat cap.  in the pouring rain outside the liquor store in New Jersey on a Sunday morning who is just a normal guy.  who may have some kind of alcohol problem, we don't know, but he's definitely, definitely unworthy of the adoration and veneration that he goes out looking for.  And isn't it ironic that if it weren't for the fact that he and his colleagues have put themselves front centre with JW Broadcasting and with the numerous videos that get put out featuring them on a yearly basis, I mean, before 2014, you could argue, it was almost unheard of to see them.  I can remember growing up and not knowing what the governing body looked like.  Because you only got the occasional mug shots in the publications.  But now they're everywhere if you're a Jehovah's Witness.  And bear in mind how many Jehovah's Witnesses there are.  It's inevitable, given the amount of video material they're pumping out, it's inevitable that these men are going to get a kind of celebrity attention.  Status.  And the drawback of being any kind of celebrity is that more people will recognize you.  And in Tony Morris' case, with millions of people familiar with his likeness, that's no exaggeration, of course he's going to get spotted.  So it was inevitable that this exact thing was going to happen at some point.  And you can be sure it's going to happen again.  Maybe not with him, but maybe with another celebrity.  governing body member, the more people know what you look like.  And especially if you're making a name for yourself as an arrogant, pig-headed, small-minded, homophobic asshole, people are going to recognize you when you nip to the booze store on a Sunday morning.  So it's fascinating for me that, again, this was inevitable.  It feels to some degree like karma.  And I was debating whether to use this opportunity to send a message to Tony because it's basically inevitable, isn't it, that he will be watching this very video.  So I've debated whether to remind him that shunning is wrong and cruel and immoral.  and that if the organization were to get rid of it they would actually be doing themselves a favor because they would make jehovah's witnesses more credible as a religion.  there would be fewer reasons to call it a cult.  this would mean more members could be attracted even if they may lose a few members who would take the opportunity to escape.  i thought about talking about about how despicable it is that he and his colleagues are still refusing to implement rudimentary reforms to protect children that due to his failure to act and his negligence and his covering up of child sex abuse there are children being molested now thanks to him and his colleagues.  I thought about talking about how his ignorant, uneducated reading of Bible passages on blood and those of his forebears have led to and are leading to the deaths of thousands of his own fellow worshippers.  I thought about talking about all of that but quite frankly I think that would be falling on deaf ears.  so perhaps it would be better to pursue the philosophy of if you can't beat them you should join them.  so Tony Morris cheers it's not forever.
