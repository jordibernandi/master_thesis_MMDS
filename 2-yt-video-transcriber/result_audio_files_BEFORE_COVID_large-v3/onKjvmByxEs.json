Welcome to another episode of Absolute Madlads, and today we're going to be talking about Robert Norman Ross, who was born in Daytona Beach, Florida on the 29th of October, 1942.  As a child, Bob had a hobby of taking care of sick and abandoned animals.  These animals included things from squirrels to rabbits, from armadillos to snakes, and even at one point, an alligator, which Bob's mother was not too happy about. ",

This was a squirrel that would actually live in Bob Ross's pocket, and he would actually keep it in there while he was painting. ",

            "text": "It's starting to come together now.  It is starting to come together.  This This looks exactly the way I want it to.  At the age of nine Bob dropped out of school so that he could work with his father as a carpenter and it was actually during this time that Bob had an accident with a table saw and he lost the top half of his index finger on his left hand.  Whenever he's doing the show he tries to hide it behind the palette because he didn't want to freak out any children that might be watching but sometimes it is a little bit noticeable.  I keep getting fucking pubes in my paint!  There we go.  That's Buddha.  There we are.  See?  That's lovely.  Turned out exactly how I wanted it to.  So what you do now is you rinse out your little brush.  Give it a little tap.  And then just beat the devil out of it.  At 18 years old, Bob enlisted in the United States Air Force and he rose to the rank of Master Sergeant.  He also served as First Sergeant at Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska.  It was during this time in Alaska that Bob spent a lot of time looking at the Alaskan mountains and forests and scenery and he fell in love with it, which is why such landscapes are a recurring theme in all of his work.  I'm sweating like fucking this if I just put that in my eye.  I fucking have as well.  Fuck's sake.  Right, I'll just do it again.  Oh for God's sake.  During his time in the military Bob started painting during his breaks and selling the paintings.  The problem was his breaks weren't very long so he had to be fast if he wanted to finish the painting and this is where Bob developed his iconic fast painting technique which meant he could whip up a work of art in as little as 20 minutes.  grass.  Bob even attended an art class at the Anchorage USO club but he found himself always at odds with the instructors who were more interested in abstract art and not Bob's style of art.  Bob was actually quoted as saying, they would tell you what makes a tree but they wouldn't tell you how to paint a tree.  While Bob was working part-time as a bartender he discovered a TV show called The Magic of Oil Painting which was hosted by a German painter called Bill Alexander.  Alexander's technique of painting was called a la prima which means first attempt but it's much better known by its modern name of wet on wet and this fast painting technique would allow him to create really nice works of art in as little as 30 minutes.  This technique is exactly what Bob was looking for.  so he started studying a la prima and he became very good at it.  He then started painting Alaskan landscapes on the inside of old gold pans and selling them on.  Eventually the money that Bob was making from selling these painted gold pans actually exceeded his military salary.  so in 1981 Bob decided to retire from the military and focus on painting.  Do you smoke herb?  I do not smoke herb.  I am a good Christian boy and I do not partake in the devil's cabbage.  The only thing that my mouth is for is for preaching the word of Jesus.  And we're just going to make ourselves a happy little tree.  A happy tree.  A happy little tree.  A happy tree.  A happy little tree.  A happy tree.  A happy tree.  A happy tree.  A happy tree.  That wasn't the only reason that Bob left the military though.  Bob was actually quoted as saying that he was quite a hard arse in the military.  He's the guy that would scream at you, yell your head off, make you scrub the latrines and all these other things and Bob just decided that that wasn't who he was as a person so, you know, just a person that yells all the time.  That's what he described it as and he decided that after he left the military he just wasn't going to yell anymore.  To be perfectly honest, I can't actually picture Bob Ross yelling at anyone.  I mean, I find it hard to believe that the man's ever raised his voice in his entire life.  Bob travelled to Florida to study under Alexander himself and ended up getting a job at Alexander's Art Supply Company where Bob worked as a travelling salesman and also an art teacher.  A woman called Annette Kowalski recognised great talent in Bob and she told him that he would be much more successful if he went off and did it on his own, with his own company.  Bob thought that that might be a good idea.  so Annette, Bob and Bob's wife pooled all of their life savings together to start this new company.  You should put some wee apples on the tree.  That big border red there is quite nice.  You're right.  Wee apples.  That'll feed the squirrels.  Squirrels don't eat apples.  Why not?  Because they just don't eat nuts.  They could eat apples if they wanted to.  They could, but they don't.  Well, they should.  They're missing the trick.  Get out of my room.  Don't get paint on my dog.  I'm not getting paint on the fucking dog.  This is a little woodland creature.  I mean, he's not.  He is.  He wouldn't survive one day in the wild.  No, he wouldn't.  No, he'd get fucking... You'd get eaten by a crow, somehow.  Crows don't even do that, but you would get eaten by one.  They wouldn't carry him away, they would just hound him till he died.  What I'm trying to say is you deserve to die.  I mean, that's a bit harsh.  Life's harsh.  How did you get paint on your arm?  Cos I punched the paint.  OK.  Right, fuck off.  The business did struggle a lot at first, which meant the three had to cut a lot of corners in order to save on expenses, but this actually led to one of the most iconic things about Bob Ross.  You see, Bob Ross's standard military-style crew cuts were too expensive, and so, in order to save money, Bob decided to go for the cheaper option.  Which was a pen.  And over the coming years, Bob Ross grew to hate it.  And I can understand why.  I fucking hate this.  This thing is an actual sweatbox on my head.  I feel like I just have a giant, scraggy pile of pubes on my fucking head, man.  I'm fucking sweating.  There's pubes in my coffee.  Cool.  There's hair pubes in my fucking coffee.  I'm still drinking it.  Whether he liked it or not, he had to keep it because his company had actually launched a line of paintbrushes, paints and other art products that all had Bob's picture on them with the perm.  So whether he liked it or not, the perm had actually became part of his brand, part of his image.  So he had to keep it.  The business grew and grew and eventually it was valued at $15 million and they were becoming very successful.  Knees weak, arms are heavy.  Heavy sweaty mum spaghetti.  I've got a pube in my eye!  There's pubes on the script, there's pubes in my coffee, there's pubes in my paint, there's pubes in my fucking eyes!  The business was selling art supplies, how-to books, as well as around the country hosting a series of art classes with teachers that were trained in what became to be known as the Bob Ross Method.  Unfortunately, this actually created a lot of strain between Bob Ross and his old mentor, Bill Alexander.  Bill was resentful towards Bob Ross because he claimed that he was the one that created the wet on wet technique and he was very angry that Bob Ross was the one that was becoming famous for it.  He felt that, in a way, Bob Ross had actually betrayed him.  How about that, Bill?  Eh?  How about that?  How about you?  get fucking good, Bill?  Get fucking good.  Get fucking good, Bill.  You fucking smelly German.  While you were out fucking bitches, I learned to paint and studied the blade.  Be gone, Satan.  I got this just to cut the cake at the wedding, but I'm gonna hang onto it for a little while, you know, just in case the Anglos start their shit again.  Bob decided he wanted to do something else that would act as marketing for his painting products and services, but also, most importantly... encourage people to paint, and this would end up becoming the thing that Bob Ross was most famous for.  So, on PBS, on the 11th of January, 1983, aired the very first episode of The Joy of Painting. ",

            "text": "Bob was actually able to film an entire series of The Joy of Painting in just two days and every painting that you see featured in each episode, Bob actually created three copies of it.  One would be a trial painting, the second one would be the one you actually see him painting on the episode and the third one would be a more refined version of the painting.  and a lot of these paintings were donated to various PBS stations.  Bob also never made any money from the Joy of Painting show itself.  All of his money came from the sale of his art supplies and services which he promoted with the show.  The show itself never made him any money, but it did act as important marketing for his other products.  The Joy of Painting aired from 1983 to 1994 and had a total of 31 seasons totalling to hundreds of episodes.  The show was extremely popular during its initial run and it is still massively popular to this day.  The Joy of Painting recently came out on Netflix.  There's also an official Bob Ross YouTube channel that has every single episode and also every week on Twitch.  they live stream episodes of The Joy of Painting and a portion of the money that they make from it gets donated to charity.  Unfortunately, in 1994, Bob Ross was diagnosed with lymphoma and he tried his best to continue with the joy of painting but he could feel himself getting weaker and weaker as time went on and so after 31 seasons he decided to retire from the joy of painting and focus on his health and focus on his family.  Bob kept his diagnosis secret from the public because he didn't want to worry people and sadly in July of 1995 Bob Ross passed away and he was buried in Woodlawn Memorial Park in Gotha, Florida.  Press F, boys.  Press F. To this day, though, Bob Ross is a cultural icon.  He's referenced constantly in pop culture and he still maintains his popularity with average people like you and me, artists and, probably most of all, the ASMR community.  Even myself.  I'm not a painter.  I'm not an artist.  You may have realised that from this video.  But even despite that, there is nothing that I love more than just sitting, relaxing and watching Bob Ross paint.  That's my idea of a good time.  Ultimately, the show brought a lot of joy to people.  A lot of people would sit at home listen to Bob Ross's soothing words, and paint alongside them.  Some of them continued painting as a hobby, some of them went on to become actual artists, and this was all because of the joy of painting and because of Bob Ross.  The man taught people to take care of little creatures, taught people to see the beauty in the world, and most importantly, taught people to believe in themselves.  God bless you, you magnificent bastard. ",
