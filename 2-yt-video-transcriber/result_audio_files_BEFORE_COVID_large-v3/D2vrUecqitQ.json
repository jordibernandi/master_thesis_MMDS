            "text": "all right how about you?  Okay.  Give your name and badge number, please.  Yeah, it's Officer Grist, 191641.  Is there a reason why you're recording there for us?  Yeah, I'm gathering content for a story.  What kind of story?  A personal story.  Or love?  It doesn't matter.  Okay.  Is there something we can help you with or help answer any questions for you?  Nothing at all.  Thank you very much.  Are you able to give me your information just so I know who I'm talking to?  Negative.  You can call me Good Citizen.  Good citizen is what you can call me.  Am I being detained?  And I'm asking you a question and you need to answer me.  I am a public citizen, private citizen.  You're a public servant.  Am I being detained?  Right now you are not.  Okay.  Thank you very much.  See you later.  It's not consensual.  I'm out here working.  I don't wish to be disturbed.  So you are dismissed.  Take care.  Dismissed.  Yeah, I don't need your approval.  Thank you very much though.  Have a good day.  Negative.  I'm in public.  So are you.  No, I'm good.  What are we doing here?  I don't answer questions, boss.  What is that?  I don't answer questions.  Can I get you to leave, please?  Uh, no.  No?  It's public, isn't it?  Yeah, but I can't have a phone out here being video recording my stuff coming in and out.  Well, I disagree.  You don't want a phone out here videotaping, but it's not that you can't have one.  Uh, I really can't, so I'd like you to go ahead and leave.  I know I'm not on state grounds, though.  If you go on the other side of the stop sign, you're more welcome to do that.  This is actually a public thoroughfare, right?  If I was coming to visit somebody, I could just drive in here, right?  Correct, but on the other side of the stop sign, you're more welcome to do that.  On this side of the stop sign is state ground.  Seeing how the fence is there, I'd like you to go back on the other side of the fence.  Well, I'm on this side of the fence.  That side of the fence, please.  I'm not sure that I have to, boss.  I'm asking you.  I'm asking nicely.  No, I understand that.  I understand you're asking me nicely, but I'm not sure that I have to do that.  I'm here to get some footage.  I'm a journalist doing a gathering footage.  Can I see your ID?  Credentials?  I'm not going to give you my ID.  Why not, sir?  And I don't have to give you credentials.  So I'm a journalist gathering content for a story.  And... I'm allowed to do this right here.  I looked up your guys' property line.  It's very public.  Do you know what I'm telling you?  This is actually a public thoroughfare.  It's not.  This is state grounds, sir.  No, this is... I understand it's state grounds, but it's public.  if i wanted to come in here like all these cars driving these are all your correction grounds knowing that once they cross that side of the time it has become state grounds.  are you aware that there's a department of homeland security memo put out in 2000 just listen put out in 2010 so i can go into a courthouse?  that's state grounds too correct Sure.  Sure.  But there's limitations on what you can do in that courthouse, right?  Correct.  Correct.  I would like you to just go on the other side, stop sign.  You're more welcome to film all you want over there.  No.  You're actually on state grounds, sir.  You're on state grounds.  You're not going to understand that.  You're on state grounds.  This is not state grounds.  You want me to go on the corner?  Sure.  Go over there.  This right here affects you.  I mean, there's a gate right here.  I'm on the other side of the gate.  Correct.  Won't you cross the stop sign, sir?  It is state grounds.  There's no trespassing signs around here at all.  Is that a law or a policy?  You said it's a policy?  Is it a policy?  You said it's a policy, right?  Correct.  It's our state policy.  State policy.  You cannot film on grounds.  I need to go back over there.  Okay.  Policies don't trump rights.  All right.  So I need you to go on the other side of Over there.  I will go call the police.  Okay, I mean, I understand you can call the police, but they're going to... No, not really, but they're going to educate you.  I'm just trying to get you to go over there and not have an issue.  I got you, but the police are just going to educate you.  And all they're going to do is say, hey, this is public, this is publicly... Two hours later.  And they're saying that you're free to go, so as far as I'm concerned, you're free to go.  Okay.  And I'm free to stay as well, right?  Officer, free to stay on this public... utility correct okay thank you guys.  hey what was your name again figueroa?  is that it?  thank you for being professional.  i appreciate it very very courteous and i will go ahead and get out of here now.  this is a public sewage line.  This is a public sewage line bus.  I just had to talk with another officer too.  Same thing.  He was a sergeant.  That's fine.  So why do you guys think this is your property?  I can talk to you.  I mean, it's perfectly legal for me to do so.  This is just a sensible conversation.  You're used to everybody saying yes, sir, and do what you say, huh?  Is that what it is?  I'm just curious.  I'm not being a dick.  I'm just asking questions.  Mr.  Helmrich, Jay, Jonathan.  I don't want to call you.  You've obviously got my name, but you won't give me your name, right?  Of course I won't.  I don't have to.  I'm a private citizen.  You're a public servant.  It's a big difference, right?  Don't you agree?  Why wouldn't you give me your name?  Just because I don't have to.  If you could educate the officers as far as dealing with the public and standing on public property.  Who do you work for, by the way?  What was that?  Who do you work for?  I work for me.  I work for myself.  Yeah, I'm independent.  Yep.  I am independent.  Okay.  You got the footage you needed?  Yeah, I'm done now.  Okay.  Is there anything you need from him?  Nope.  He has my information.  Contact our public information officer.  I am requesting that you leave our grounds now.  Okay.  This is public.  We got that straight, right?  I'm in public.  Now I might stay here for another hour.  I mean, you know.  You can take a picture of me.  That's fine.  That's okay.  That's your right, officer, to do that.  What's your name, sir?  I'm not going to give you my name.  Is there a reason you don't want to be named?  I just don't give my name out.  Are you wanted by the law?  No.  Are you wanted by the law?  I'm wanted to do my job.  You got anything on you you're not supposed to have?  No, everything is perfectly legal, except in the state of California.  I'm a smartass.  I'm just... I don't mind you being a smartass, but normally the only people in my history that I've been doing this job that don't want to give names is because they have something to hide.  I'm just curious.  No, that's interesting.  Actually, you guys took an oath to... I told these guys this.  You guys took an oath to uphold the Constitution.  The Constitution doesn't say that people don't want to give you their names, have something to hide, right?  Not everybody's a criminal, boss.  I'm not going to sit here and claim that you're a criminal.  Right, right.  I hope you don't because I'm not.  I'm going to get out of here because I actually have criminals to look for.  And I appreciate it.  You guys should go do your job for sure.  And I'm free to stay as well, right?  Officer, free to stay on this public utility, correct?  Okay.  Thank you, guys.  Officer, what's your name?  Windham.  Windham.  Don't look so grumpy, man.  How many hours you got till you go home?  This is my happy moment.  Is that you happy?  It only gets worse from here.  How many hours till you go home?  Not too many.  Not too many?  Badge numbers?  Mine?  Yeah.  Tried on my vest.  Both of them.  Okay.  Well, I'm not that good at reading, but I guess I'll try to record it so we can see it.  It'd be nice if you just say it, though.  It's capper 3471.  There we go.  That's what I'm talking about.  All right.  Anything else I can help with?  No, that's it, man.  All right, I'm here to serve.  Oh, there is something you can help me with.  What's that?  You guys can remove that flag from your uniform.  Nope.  That is desecrating the U.S.  flag, and that's actually a law, and it's actually a violation of that law.  Okay.  You know, when that flag is displayed in its official capacity, it's not supposed to be desecrated.  It's supposed to look like this.  Okay.  okay so just a little bit of advice and i'm not even in here for confrontation.  it's just that that right.  there is bs and your attitude about it is bs as well.  make sure it's clean and i look tidy.  yeah it looks like our secured vehicles.  anything public i will record not go down there.  i never said i'll go down there.  i said anything public.  anything public i will record.  if it's public i will go down there.  so just calm your little attitude down all right.
