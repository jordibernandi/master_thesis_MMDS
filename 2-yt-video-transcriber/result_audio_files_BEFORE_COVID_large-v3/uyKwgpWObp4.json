Ghosts have been around for a long time.  I mean, the disciples saw Jesus walking on the water and said, it's a ghost.  Yeah.  So the idea of a ghost, but the problem is what Paul said, and Bill used this in an earlier program, that to be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord.

There are spiritual beings.  I think that's the truth behind this, right?  That, you know, even the old translations speak of the Holy Spirit as the Holy Ghost.  You know, and I even sometimes pray that way in church.  You know, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.  I grew up with that language.  And that's referring to the fact that there is a spiritual realm.  We each have spirits.  And so, you know, I think there's a truth there.  But really, once we die, I mean, our spirit goes to its final place.

It's not that they see the future, it's the demonic makes it happen in situations like that and people believe it.  I've seen that in other cultures around the world.
