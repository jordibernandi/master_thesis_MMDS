The employer, the big employer in our island is the government.  And to help you, you can see most of their legislators, they are part of a church.  Most of their senators, they are part of a church.  Because it's easy when you're in the church, you can connect with the politics and be running for office.  So I think that that is a privilege they have.  In South America, I can see, if you're in the Catholic, it's more attached to the education.  The Catholic Church is more involved in the community, not too much in the politics, but most of them in the education.  For example, in Colombia, Bogota, the schools, the Catholic schools, When you have a doctor who has a religion, probably you don't go feel confident.  Or if you express what you have or your mental thinking or your disease, if you have HIV, for example, they thinking that's a punishment because you do something wrong.  How will they go provide you a good medical service or a good mental health when in their minds they don't believe you are a good person or you need help?  In their minds, that's a punishment.  After the hurricane, the people start regarding about religions, what is the purpose for the religion in the community, referring to the infrastructure of the church.  Like, what are they doing after I donate money to you, after I attend your service, after I do all this, now why do you give it back to us?  So I see the people now understanding the church is not community help even.  Even the people start asking why they don't pay taxes if they don't help us.  They collect a lot of money.  What do they do with the money?  Why during this hell they're supposed to have taxes sent?  because the charity and they don't do any charity.  They don't help the people.  The people now start understanding the church don't have purpose. ",

Because atheism is not only about not believing in God, it is also about the rights of all people to be what they want to be and at the same time be fair with everyone and that everyone has a freedom, but also understanding.
