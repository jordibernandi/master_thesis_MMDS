            "text": "So today I just want to talk about the idea that women can have it all.  I don't know who's selling this idea, but I know that women are falling for it.  Feminism for sure.  Like women, women, roar.  Women roar.  We're so powerful and so amazing.  Our bodies, our rights.  We can do whatever the f*** we want.  I just don't understand the whole realm that we're living in right now where everyone thinks that they are deserved.  Not just a few things, but like everything.  Okay, let's tell a story.  Let's go on with this fun story of a life of.  you can have everything.  If you're going to go to school, how are you going to get there?  You're going to have to study really hard.  And then depending upon where you're at in your academic intelligence and what you can showcase to the admittance board, you will get into a great school or not.  And then you have to do something with that education.  You have to get very high grades and you have to be a part of different organizations and really prove that you're better than all those people around you.  You're not equal.  You're better than.  So you prove that and then you go and you get a degree and you get a great job.  And you want to be making as much as the best person there if they have the same job title, right?  Because you probably wouldn't be getting paid any less.  Because I think your idea is that you would be getting paid the exact amount of money as the other people around you with the exact same job title.  Yeah.  I don't know if you're performing at that exact level that they would be if they're getting more money, but in your head, yes, it's all fair, it's all equal, except for it wasn't in school because you had to prove that you were better and you were unequal, okay?  I'm just trying to follow along here.  So you get a great job and you try to earn credibility, you try to earn money, and you're just having fun out in the world and you're meeting guys and nothing's really serious because you're not ready.  because you want a career.  And then around 30, 35, you start thinking pretty heavily about having a child, and that becomes very important to you.  Maybe it's not fair, but it's just what you want.  And maybe it's time to find a great partner.  But here's the deal.  You're 30, 35.  You're not a 10 anymore.  Maybe you are.  But now the guys that have actually wanted a family and wanted to raise something right off the bat are pretty much taken by women who are also ready around the age of 20 to 28, 26.  So all the really great guys are gone, but you think you're wonderful.  I mean, you can have it all.  You deserve everything.  So you go into the world and maybe you're a six, but you want a six or a seven or an eight and all the eights are definitely gone.  And the sevens are not really into you because you're a six and the sixes that you date, you feel unequal to because you feel better than them.  And now what?  And now you just really want a baby and maybe you can have a baby on your own.  That's fine.  Okay.  Because you can have it all.  So maybe you become a single mother and then you also have your job because you're great at everything.  You can have it all.  You have your baby.  You're a single mother.  Look at you.  go, girl.  Doing it all on your own with no partner.  That's super commendable.  What a hot shot.  Number two, your values.  Your values should be echoed around.  Your values should be echoed everywhere you go.  If someone thinks differently, it kind of hurts.  It kind of hurts.  So you want a safe space and you're entitled to that because you can have it all.  So the people around you have to bend to what you see as moral, what you see as virtuous, your ideas, your thoughts, every amount of all the hours that you've put into coming up with a conclusion, whether you've spent zero hours or a hundred hours, if the people around you don't agree, it's not safe and you deserve a safe space.  I don't know who told you that.  I think your professors, but anyway, you deserve it.  So how are you going to do that?  You're, you're single and you have a kid on your own and you have a full-time job and now you have to like change your whole community so they don't say anything offensive to you.  Oh my God.  Shit's piling up, but don't worry.  You can do it.  You can have it all.  You probably want a house that you're proud to call home.  When you have friends over, you're like, yeah, this is my house.  But the thing is it's expensive.  That's not fair, but you can have it all.  You have your job, you have your kid and you have your friends, you have your dinner parties and you have your wine and you have your cheese or you have your McDonald's or whatever it is.  Why doesn't your house look as good as your friend's house?  That's not fair.  I was positive that you could have it all.  So what are you going to do?  Maybe the government, maybe the government can help you.  The government... Actually, the government doesn't owe you, but the people around you that do.  Those idiots that wanted to have kids right away and then they coupled up and they created a relationship and a marriage and they're doing well in life, they're paying a little bit less per household with combined income than you are as a single parent.  That's not fair.  So maybe they should help you.  Maybe the government should collect money from them to help you because you can have it all.  We're cooking with gas now.  I have good news in this story.  You meet an eight and you're really excited about him.  He's very good looking and he's super fun and he's really charming.  And you haven't, you haven't felt this in years because you finally have found someone who you think you, you think deserves you or you deserve whatever.  So you can't hold on.  You've been, you've been without sex for a long time.  So you sleep with them right away.  But then he's not interested and he goes away because maybe he wasn't that into you or maybe you just didn't allow him the time to get to know you and your kid that you had, you know.  So you... ",
