Hi, I have a Jeep, looks like a Cherokee, license plate 8YL314, taking a left behind Calaresos.  And now he is taking, he's at the set of lights right now, and he's taking a left.  He's gone into the Calaresos parking lot.  He identified himself as a police officer.  He's got a light kit in the front of his car, and then he pulled out a badge that was obviously fake, and then he threatened to kill me.  He's parked right in front of Cala Resos right now, and I'd like an officer assistance.  I have everything on video.  No, I'm in Wakefield.  I'm sorry, I'm in the farmland.  Yeah, I'm in the front parking lot right now.  I'm just approaching it.  And he's here, yes.  7-8-1.  I have everything on video.  He approached me, threatened me, identified himself as a police officer, Josh Abrams.  I mean, I wouldn't have even talked to him that long.  It's just he's got a light kit in his car, and then he says he's a police officer.  Now he sees me.  So now he's pulling out of the Calariso's parking lot.  and he's taking a right onto Westwater Street and, oh my God, he almost just smashed, oh my God.  Are you okay?  He just almost hit somebody and now he's continuing to take a right onto Foster Street and he's behind the farmland again.  I'm just trying to keep a distance, yeah, because he said in the video that he's got a gun in his car.  So I'm trying to keep my distance from him.  Yep, he just took another right, so the farmland is on his right-hand side.  He's coming out to that set of lights where Cala Ray says the farmland is direct.  Some guy's trying to pull a gun on me.  He says he's a cop.  Are you driving?  No, I'm on foot.  He's in the parking lot again now, and he's in front of farmland now in the parking lot.  Yeah, he's driving in circles.  Now he's back in front of the parking lot.  Sir, the police are coming.  Okay, so he just threatened to kill me again.  He's going to shoot me now.  He's trying to take off now.  Okay, so he does have a gun.  He just pulled something up into the front of his... He's sitting in his car.  He just pulled something up into the front of his dashboard.  He does have a weapon.  He does have a weapon.  Yes, I did.  Yep.  Someone just got in the car.  Now he's taking the right onto Westwater Street and he's traveling at a high rate of speed.  I'm going down Westwater Street with the CVS on his left and he's traveling towards the parking structure.  All right.  I can tell you in a second if he's taking a right or a left at that street.  He's on the wrong side of the road now.  He's parked in the middle of the street.  Hands out the window, waving something.  I can't see.  Now he's, no, he parked, he waved something out the window, and now he's taking a right onto that street where the, yep, where the gas station would be on your right.  And now I've lost sight of him.  But I'd like to file a complaint, and yeah, I'll be in front of Farmland.  Thank you. ",
