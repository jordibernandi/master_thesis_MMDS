We should all sign on to it.  But if you're a poor family just trying to make ends meet, it's a horrible idea.  It's kind of like saying, I'll sign on to the Green New Deal, but I'll take a private jet from D.C.  to California.  A private jet.  Or I'll take my Uber SUV.  I won't take the train.  Or I'll go to Davos and fly my private jet.  The hypocrisy.  Or I'll stump for the 2016 candidate, and I'll demand private jets to fly me around the country, but then I'll come in and demand that every other American live by a certain set of standards that I don't abide by myself.  And so, Madam Chair, I bring this up because I'm going to vote against it.  But I bring it up because I think we should debate it because I think it's a horrible idea.  And again, it doesn't help the poor.  And so if you support it, you should vote for it.  And you should not have a point of order.  You should debate it.  You should discuss it.  And if you like it and you want to jump the cost of housing, you should vote for it.  With that, I am going to vote no because I think it's a bad idea and hurts the poorest among us.  I yield back.

And it makes me feel as though our efforts have been effective, at the very least, in distancing between the dangerous strategy of climate denial, which we know is costing us lives.  at least 3,000 Americans in Puerto Rico in Hurricane Maria.  But aside from that, when we talk about the concern of the environment as an elitist concern, One year ago, I was waitressing in a taco shop in downtown Manhattan.  I just got health insurance for the first time a month ago.  This is not an elitist issue.  This is a quality of life issue.  You want to tell people that their concern and their desire for clean air and clean water is elitist?  Tell that to the kids in the South Bronx, which are suffering from the highest rates of childhood asthma in the country.  Tell that to the families in Flint, whose kids, their blood is ascending in lead levels.  Their brains are damaged for the rest of their lives.  Call them elitist.  You're telling them that those kids are trying to get on a plane to Davos?  People are dying.  They are dying.  And the response across the other side of the aisle is to introduce an amendment five minutes before a hearing and a markup?  This is serious.  This should not be a partisan issue.  This is about our constituents and all of our lives.  Iowa, Nebraska, broad swaths of the Midwest are drowning right now, underwater.  farms, towns that will never be recovered and never come back.  And we're here, and people are more concerned about helping oil companies than helping their own families?  I don't think so.  I don't think so.  This is about our lives.  This is about American lives.  And it should not be partisan.  Science should not be partisan.  we are facing a national crisis.  And if we do not ascend to that crisis, if we do not ascend to the levels in which we were threatened at the Great Depression, when we were threatened in World War II, if we do not ascend to those levels, if we tell the American public that we are more willing to invest and bail out big banks than we are willing to invest in our farmers and our urban families, then I don't know what we're here doing.  I don't know what we're here doing.  So I welcome the sudden enthusiasm to address the climate.  And in that spirit, I want to reach my hand across the aisle and say, let's do a hearing.  Let's do a hearing on environment and housing.  And I'm happy to do that.  And I'm happy to bring forth and entertain that provision of the bill.  Thank you very much.  I yield my time. ",

Well, if you come to my district, you can't take a deep breath because one of five children have asthma, three times higher hospitalization rate among adults, and three of my zip codes have one of some of the most polluting industries in my district.  My father, who had cancer, literally White Cross campaigns in my district showing seven homes in a row of somebody surviving cancer or died of cancer.  And we're what we call the front line of what's happening with our climate.  We are the ones already dying because we haven't done anything to address climate change in our country.  And I just wanted to express that quality of life of understanding what's actually happening to this if we truly want to debate this now.  But also, it is really important as we talk about homelessness that we lead with compassion, that we understand, and you all know this, that we of course have to look at ways that we get there, but we have to agree that we need to address it.  And I think if we all agree to address it, then we can move forward in deciding ways to do that.  And I feel like this bill gets us there, because we'll find ways to pay for it, because it becomes a priority, because people become a priority over anything else, especially those that are the most vulnerable, our veterans, our children, our families.  With that, Madam Chairwoman Waters, I would like to yield the rest of my time to my good colleague from New York. ",

            "text": "Thank you.  And I thank my colleague from Michigan.  You know, we talk about cost.  We're going to pay for this whether we pass a Green New Deal or not.  Because as towns and cities go underwater, as wildfires ravage our communities, we are going to pay.  And we're either going to decide if we're going to pay to react or if we're going to pay to be proactive.  And what we know is that prevention, when you spend less money on prevention, you would... you can prevent a lot of that damage from happening in the first place.  So it's not a question of whether we're going to spend the money.  Because I'm very sad to say that the government knew that climate change was real starting as far back as 1989 when NASA was reporting this.  And the private sector knew way back in the 1970s.  So we had until around the time I was born to address this issue.  I wish it didn't have to cost so much.  But I'm going to turn 30 this year, and for the entire 30 years of my lifetime, we did not make substantial investments to prepare our entire country for what we knew was coming.  So now it's coming all up at the end.  It's like when we live our whole lives, and we don't eat healthily, and we don't move, and we pursue unhealthy activities.  And then at the end of our lives, our health care costs are very high.  We have the choice to lower the cost now because I can tell you the cost of pursuing a Green New Deal will be far less than the cost of not passing it.  And with respect to our brothers and sisters and neighbors that are in agriculture, bring them to the table.  Let's hold hearings.  Let's add provisions.  Let's amend the legislation to accommodate for the just transition and for the encouragement of those industries to grow.  And I would also encourage to my colleague on the other side of the aisle that thinks we're trying to ban cows to actually read the resolution and understand that there's nothing to that effect in the legislation.  And not only that, but we're trying to invest in these communities and our agricultural workers so that they can enjoy prosperity into the next century.  Thank you very much. ",
