            "text": "Iran is the largest prison in the world for female journalists.  Journalist Sanaz Alayari and her husband in six months detention with no end date.  The charge, forming a group with the intent to disturb national security.  Journalist Marzia Amiri, sentenced to 10 and a half years in prison and 148 lashes.  The charge, disturbing the public order.  These are just two examples among many.  In fact, Iran has more female journalists in prison than any other country in the world.  You haven't heard about this because most of the mainstream media aren't talking about it.  But Reporters Without Borders is.  Alerting the world to 10 new arrests and interrogations in the month of August alone.  A free press is a critical part of any society and a necessity for a functioning state.  Javayid Rehman, the UN Special Rapporteur on the UN Human Rights Situation in Iran, needs our help to intervene.  He can make a difference, but public support is critical.  Let's reach out to him at the link below.  Together, we really can make a difference. ",
