            "text": "The seventh area of activity in the textbook for victims of white supremacy is the area of religion.  Very powerful force.  So how do you handle discussions about religion?  That's the question.  All problems are solved through the process of questions and answers.  That's a part of the codified mantra, you might say.  All problems, no exceptions.  So you go into the question mode.  So you say, well, When you talk about religion, what you usually get, what, is an endless argument.  I have sat in barbershops like forever, and those arguments about the Bible and Christianity and whatnot are endless.  I mean, you can leave that barbershop with your haircut or with your braids or whatever you do, and you can come back seven years later if those same people are sitting in there.  They'll be having the same argument they had when you left.  Now, a lot of people can testify to that truth, all right?  I mean, nothing is ever resolved.  It just goes on and on and on and on.  Yeah, but Solomon said this.  and I know my Bible, and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And the other person says, oh, man, you know, I got, you know, I mean, you know, I used to preach myself.  So I know you ain't talking about that.  I mean, you know, because it says in Chronicles, man, so and so and so and so.  So what about that?  And it just goes on and on and on and on and on.  So it comes down to one question.  What do you do about that?  And what do you do about it when people actually start hitting each other over the head with the Bible?  I mean, sometimes it really gets out of hand.  You know, and you have what you call religious wars where people start taking out swords.  Well, if you don't believe it, I mean, I'll show you, okay?  Now you've got something that you didn't have when you started talking in the first place.  So what do you do?  According to the code, what I've written is just three simple things.  and I don't deviate from them.  You ask questions, just street questions.  What is the name of your religion, sir or ma'am?  Question number one, because most religions have names.  Number two, what does your religion require you to do in all nine areas of activity?  And then you list them.  Economics, education, entertainment, labor, law, politics, religion, sex, and war.  So you're asking questions now, and do not help the person with the answer.  You're asking questions.  You already know what you think.  That's not what you're doing.  You want to know what they are about.  and what to do about what they are about, and how to interact with this person, if you're going to interact with them at all.  This is the recommended compensatory counter-racist formula that I say.  Those three things are named two.  Number three, what does your religion require you to do when you interact with me?  Now, I'll go over them again right briefly.  What is the name of your religion?  What does your religion require you to do in all nine areas of activity?  All right.  And what does your religion require you to do in all of those nine areas of activity when you interact with me as a person, as an individual person?  Because all religions, for the most part, have requirements.  And that's all you should need to know.  And don't argue about anything else other than that.  If the person starts telling you about what holy book they use and all like that, you'll say, well, that's a part of your religion, so that's your business.  All right?  I ain't going to argue with you about none of it.  Don't ever get into a Bible argument with anybody.  Just ask them those three questions.  Because ultimately, that's all that's going to count anyway, if you stop and think about it scientifically.  The only thing that's really going to count after you all talk and argue for 40,000 years... about what the Bible means and what this chapter means and what David did, you know, and what the woman at the well was wearing and, you know, and whether or not she had a turban on her head.  I mean, you know, you can go on and on and on about that, okay?  No.  What is the name of your religion?  What does your religion require you to do?  And what does your religion, this is your religion now, sir or ma'am, require you to do when you interact with me?  So I know what to expect when I see you coming.  You know, what I know whether to, you know, go toward you or away from you.  Because your religion might require you to do me harm.  So when I see you coming down the road, and since you told me, yeah, when I see people like you, you're a non-believer.  I'm supposed to, you know, go after you and whoop you into believing.  Well, I don't want to take no whipping, so I start running.  That's all.  I mean, but if everybody on the planet just does that, we'll have a real quick understanding of religion and what religion is supposed to produce.  All you want to know is what does it require them to do when they interact with you.  That's the clincher question.  See, those first two questions are just the preparatory questions.  What's the name of your religion?  It doesn't make no difference what the name of a person's religion is.  It really doesn't.  All right?  What you really want to know is what you're going to do.  See?  You know, people, religions are full of rhetoric.  All religions are full of words.  Man, words like you wouldn't believe that go on and on and on.  But at the end, at the beginning and the end of each day, scientifically, in this universe, the only thing that really matters is what a person does, not what they say.  All right?  Saying leads up to the doing, all right?  See, saying always leads up to somebody doing something.  What you want to do is clinch what they're going to do.  And if the person says, oh, my religion requires, when I come in contact with a person like you, my religion requires you to convert you to my religion.  Now you know.  All right?  Okay.  So let them talk.  And when they finish, say thank you very much.  And then when you hear the other person down the road say the same thing, my religion requires me to convert you to my religion, you listen to them.  Okay?  But if their religion says, my religion requires me to convert you to my religion, or else I'm going to come around tonight and burn your house down.  Now, what you do is get some fire extinguishers and maybe a gun and maybe whatever help you can get if you don't want your house burned down because the person has told you what they're going to do now.  See, all you've got to do is just keep asking questions.  The answers will take you right where you need to go in record time, but don't interfere with the answers.  So, you know, I've been through all of this, okay, all of it.  So I know where it's going, okay?  That's why I wrote what I wrote.  And, you know, usually it's a short conversation.  Because people say, well, you believe in Jesus Christ.  If they're talking about Christianity, I say, okay, believe in Jesus Christ doing what?  Believe in Jesus Christ being your Savior.  I say, okay, so I believe that somebody came to save me from my evil doings?  I don't have no problem with that.  Is that what this is all about?  I ain't got no problem with that.  Somebody going to save me from my evil doings?  I got no problem with that.  Now, next problem.  Yeah, that's all you got to do is just keep asking questions.  And that's going to be a short conversation.  If you don't believe it, try it.  And that will be resolved.  This thing that you're saying has been dragging on, because it drags on with millions of people.  You can stop this from dragging on.  Because all they got to do is just tell you, you know, because every Christian I ever talked to has said, just believe on Jesus, and that's it.  I say, that's it?  And I say, yeah.  Why should I deny that?  Why should I deny somebody coming 2,000 years ago to save me here in 2018 for whatever sins I have put out there and assuming that I have done some?  I ain't going to argue with that.  That doesn't call for an argument because everything has been said.  Hey, and if I believe that, okay.  So I don't have no problem believing that because that could be true.  And so why would I reject it?  Somebody coming to do anything for me, even if it ain't true.  Just a report that somebody came to help me.  I said, I ain't got no problem with that at all because I need help.  You know, hey, dump all the help that you possibly can get.  Dump it on me full time.  All right.  So let's go on to the next problem.  Is it another problem in this house?  All right.  Because we have settled that one. ",
