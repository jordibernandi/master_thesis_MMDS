            "text": "Tom Watson kicked him in the teeth by saying that Labour should not support a general election for another six months.  And in that six months, a second referendum should be held between Theresa May's Brexit deal, already dead and buried, which Labour under Watson would disinter and put back, mouldering from its grave on the table, and have a new referendum between Theresa May's dead Brexit deal and remaining.  With him as the Deputy Leader, Thornberry as the Foreign Secretary, Macdonnell as the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Abbott as the Home Secretary, Starmer as the Brexit Secretary, are all pledged to campaign to remain.  It's an odd way of living up to the manifesto promise which Labour successfully ran with in just 2017, scoring 40% in the polls.  They're now down in the mid-20s at best.  But in 2017 they promised to respect the result of the 2016 referendum, to respect the decision of the majority in that referendum, but merely to renegotiate the terms.  That's what Corbyn wants to do, but all of his confederates now, all of them, including his closest confederates, colleagues McDonnell and Abbott, who wouldn't get a chance of a sniff of a front bench under any leader except Corbyn, have joined the gang, the gang that seeks to break Brexit.
