I gave him, like, the quick thing for you, mentioning everything.  Yes, I do.  It's like half of the other callers were there.  And basically, I was calling back because I promised I'd call back in a week or two.  Couldn't call last week, unfortunately, but I'm here now.  And I wanted to, I guess, again, thank... It's a second thank you, basically, because Matt, I just want to mention, like I said two weeks ago, if you had seen it, I thanked Mr.  Atheist, because he actually helped me a lot with calling myself an atheist.  I was going by the term agnostic for about a year and a half until recently, because pretty much all the group of atheist people I had watched all were like far right, very anti-LGBT and everything.  And he was one of the few people who was very much pro-LGBT and also a member.  So for another person who is also a member of the LGBT and non-religious and everything, I think he was really the final push I needed to call myself an atheist.  On the other hand, Matt, you were actually pretty much the first influence, and I only remembered this seeing the atheist experience about maybe three weeks ago, like a week before I called.  Because I realized, I noticed your face and it was so weird because the first time I'd ever seen you, I didn't watch you as like a caller or anything.  This is maybe, oh shoot, like 2010, 2011?  Back when I was like barely, not even a teenager.  And I was like a super religious kid.  I was basically planning on becoming a Catholic priest and everything.  So like you were with a minister.  And I'd actually planned on doing that up until about 15 or 16 when I started having like serious doubts about religion and everything.  And I remember the first sort of real doubt in being a Christian that I'd ever seen.  I saw some guy trying to tear your arguments apart, basically.  And the creepy thing was, it was like a half hour long.  Guy didn't even talk.  It was just one of those text-to-speech things.  It was just very eerie.  But the big thing was, like, at the moment, whenever he was talking about you saying stuff with the burden of proof, he basically, it kind of hit me that you were the only one making sense in the argument.  Ah.  And it was, you know, at first I felt this profound disappointment that this other religious person was talking up the arguments, and I thought I could do better.  Yes.  And basically I tried to do better, and then about seven, eight years later I realized, no, I really couldn't.  Well, thanks for that story. ",

And as long as the conversation that we have, I think, is similar or identical to a conversation with somebody who genuinely had that belief, then I don't care if they're a prank caller that much.  because it's about having this conversation.

Pansexual part, not so important right now, but atheist specifically.  I'm kind of, and I'm still kind of nervous about this, I'm trying to get to the point where I can comfortably come out to my parents as an atheist.  Because they're super religious.  I really don't want to do anything related to the pansexual part until after I'm out of the house and everything.  But I feel like they would be at least a little bit open to talking about religion and everything.  But part of the thing I wanted to do was... get advice from some other different people about different arguments people use.

None of them rise to the level of actually being reasonable.  So a different version of this question that I'm far more interested in is \u2013 Talk to believers who've just found their way out, or former believers who found their way out, and ask them, what was the straw that broke the camel's back?  What was the thing that kept you going?  Was it a fear of hell?  Because if it's a fear of hell, that doesn't mean the argument itself is good or reasonable, but it's very compelling.  This fear of what if I'm wrong and I spend forever in hell?  I think that's one of the things that keep most people believing irrespective of how strong an argument it is. ",

There's no pressure in trying to memorize everything now so you can be ready for anything.  And honestly, I think if you come in with that kind of mindset, you might come off as more hostile, especially if you're super red on it and you're like, ah, I know this specific argument.  This is flawed because of X, Y, and Z. And at that point, they might not want to have a conversation with you at all because if it doesn't feel like the conversation is friendly.
