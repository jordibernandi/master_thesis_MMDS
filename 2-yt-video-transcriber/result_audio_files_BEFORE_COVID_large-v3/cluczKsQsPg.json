            "text": "In, I think it was the summer of 1994, I had a pastor friend who had traveled back here, and he brought back a report of what God was doing.  And so I purposed in my heart at that moment, at the earliest chance, I needed to try to fly back here.  What happened for me is we started to have a similar outpouring of the Spirit at the church I pastored.  It was in a city called Weaverville.  It's a mountain community.  And in 1987, we had this unusual visitation following two John Winbrook conferences that I attended.  When I got home, things just blew up.  But it was sporadic over the next many years.  And so when I heard about what was happening in Toronto, I asked the Lord, I said, God, if you'll touch me again, I'll never change the subject.  Because I realized that what I did is I took the move of God and I added it to what we were already doing.  instead of making it the heart and soul of who we were.  And so I made that promise to the Lord.  And so when I came to Toronto, the Lord really impacted me.  I received prayer every chance I got.  I think I was prayed for five times.  the first night, you know, I just get in every line I could and, and, uh, and received a tremendous sense of presence and peace, but I had no dramatic encounters.  That was a number of months later, but I knew that I had just seen what I was going to give the rest of my life to.  But when I went home, I began at that moment to never change the subject again, but to make the outpouring of the Spirit, that which God was doing in the earth, the only thing I lived for.  But it was all ignited here.  It was all that fire of passion.  I didn't come as a burnt out pastor.  I heard the testimonies, the stories of so many that came that were just at wit's end.  And I wasn't at that place.  We were in a really good place.  But I did come hungry because I knew there was so much more.  When I walked into the room, I realized, this is it.  This is it.  So I give the rest of my life to this.  And so that is really where the Lord rekindled what he deposited in us earlier in 1987 and then just took it to a whole other level.  Every week from that February date in 1995, every week since then, No exceptions.  That's all we do.  We don't just pursue manifestations, those kinds of things.  We just are interested in the presence of the Lord, learning to host that presence, learning to take risks, learning to see what Jesus experienced and modeled, have that demonstrated in the church.  And we've been on a real journey of learning how to host that presence, how to give ourselves to Him more completely.  and give him room to do whatever he wants to do.  And it's becoming a real lifestyle for us now after these 12, 13 years.  It's really changed how we do life.  And the cool thing for us is that we've seen now with this outpouring of the Spirit, there's a culture that is forming.  that is all, it's what we refer to as a revival culture.  Because the heart of God is for a culture to be formed in an outpouring of the Spirit.  Because then that culture actually helps to sustain a movement.  If you look at various cults around the world, they exist because they succeeded in developing a culture around their beliefs. ",

            "text": "Okay, so I had to stop it right there.  I don't know if you caught that, but he said they're trying to develop a culture because that's what sustains a movement.  And that's what they are.  The whole Bethel-Nar thing is a movement.  And then he goes into comparing it to the works of a cult.  And that's how they get their strong following.  And you've seen many videos talking about this.  Let's continue. ",

            "text": "And the culture is where the church has failed sometimes because what we experience in the church doesn't dramatically change how we do life outside of the four walls of the church.  So we're experiencing a transformation where there's an infiltration into our city, which is bringing transformation change to a whole city.  But it's coming out of that, the experience with the Lord, the encounters with the Lord, the manifestations are included, all the above, the miracles, all of it is just changing how we approach life.  And all of that came and really started as it was ignited in our time here.  The mother church, which is where I'm at now, saw what was happening.  They were without a pastor and they asked us to come back down.  And their sole desire was for revival.  And that was their whole motivation in asking us because they visited up in the mountains where we live.  They visited and they saw what God was doing.  And they said, we've got to handle this.  And so the leadership, 100% support behind that move and asked us to come now.  One of the first Sunday nights that we were there, the people were tired.  They were tired because they'd been without a pastor for eight months.  They'd really been emotionally up and down, spiritually up and down, and it was an exhausting season for them.  And so I invited the Holy Spirit to come, and the power of God fell on one lady.  And my wife and I looked at each other and we put our thumbs up and went, we got it.  It's unstoppable now.  We can't stop it.  Because we were moved by the fact that God came, and we knew that this is now unstoppable.  It doesn't matter what anybody does.  And so we began to just sow into that, and by sowing into it in teaching, in giving opportunity for people to be touched by God, by the power and the presence of the Lord.  And healing hadn't broken out so much at the beginning.  It was just transformation of individual lives internally.  And so it just started to spread like wildfire.  the Lord began to pour in, and miracles began to break out.  It became normal for miracles on a weekly basis, and now it's come to a daily basis, and in public places.  It doesn't matter where it is.  There's just.  every day is an occasion for extraordinary miracles.  But it all started with that kind of a breakthrough where, as the people, they said, listen, we want this more than anything.  And there were many who paid a tremendous price to follow the Lord in this outpouring.  I believe that God is looking for groups of people, for congregations, for individuals, for families that are willing to give themselves to host the presence of the Lord.  It's not miracles, so I can put a notch on my Bible, It's not even the amount of souls that can be saved.  so I can impress people with the stories.  It is literally that the Lord would find a resting place.  That He would find a place to rest His presence upon a group of people.  My conviction is the Lord will give us the measure of His presence that we're willing to jealously guard.  It's whatever I'm willing to pay a price for.  What measure of His presence am I willing to take a bullet for?  That's the measure I will live in and impart to my community.  And what I believe God is doing is that there are geographical locations that will be centers of literally of the presence of the Lord.  We already have this happening in some measure right now where people will walk into the building, walk into the atmosphere without prayer, without anything happening, There'll be a deliverance, there'll be a conversion, there'll be some sort of encounter with the Lord.  that isn't because there was a good sermon, isn't because the worship time was extraordinary, isn't because of the prayer of faith.  It's simply because of the abiding presence.  And we already have extraordinary miracles from cancer to bipolar to just amazing thing, broken necks.  We had two broken necks healed in one Sunday just during worship just because of giving place for the presence of the Lord.  And I feel like what the Lord is doing is there are places being marked right now, being marked or people being marked as the people of his presence.  And what's going to happen is there's going to be unusual increasing manifestations of his glory.  Because this that God's about to do is all about the glory.  It's all about the glory.  It's not about the numbers of people who come or are impacted or churches planted.  Those things are huge and they're important.  It's not about the number of cancer cases that are healed.  Really important though.  It's not about how many homeless we feed, but we really love it and give ourselves to it.  It's really about hosting the presence to where the glory of God permeates a region.  The glory actually permeates a people.  The weightiness of God's presence actually comes and rests upon a people until there's impact as the fingerprint of God on a city, on a nation.  And that's what I'm looking for right now.  And so what happens?  in John 2, for example, when the water was turned to wine, in verse, I think it's 9 or 11, somewhere in that area, it says, and these signs Jesus did manifesting his glory.  So what happens is as we minister to people and they get delivered or set free or saved or healed and the miracle takes place, the power of God is released into their life, there's a release of glory into the atmosphere.  And the way I see it personally is that people like you and me get equipped to confront realms of darkness, to do the works that Jesus said to do.  He said, as the Father sent me, I send you.  And then he said, I came to destroy the works of the evil one.  So that's my assignment.  It's pretty simple.  It's pretty clear that wherever I see the handiwork of the devil, my assignment is to fix it.  My assignment is to reverse it.  And so whenever we pray and that miracle comes, glory is released.  And that's what I see happening right now, is there's a dramatic increase of presence.  And the Lord is, what I think is, I think he's wanting to raise up a generation of people that will learn to live from the presence of God as opposed to merely living from the principles of God.  And that's a big deal.  Because the principles, there is success.  But with presence, there is no failure.  And that's what the Lord is looking for, is for a company of people that will just carry presence.  Because then we impact every room we walk into.  We impact every group that we talk to because our words become spirit, the way Jesus taught in John 6.  We change the atmosphere of cities.  When he put the spirit of the resurrected Christ in us, when he put him in me, he expected me to conquer something.  He expected me to bring fruit from the realm of the impossibilities of life.  Because that's what demonstrates the resurrection power is resurrection from death to life.  Something was changed.  I can no longer be satisfied with things that are humanly possible.  We do them.  We feed the poor.  We collect the money for missions.  We build the buildings.  We do all the stuff that's humanly possible, but they are not the high point of our celebration.  The high point of our celebration is the child in the womb that's pronounced Down syndrome that Jesus heals before it's born.  The resurrection that takes place from the dead.  Those are our high points.  The cancer that disappears.  The deaf ears that pop open.  The bipolar that is suddenly gone.  The schizophrenic that is no longer, is now in the right mind.  These are the things.  And this that we carry that I carry, that we carry.  I'm in debt.  I owe God fruit.  Jesus cursed a fig tree once because it didn't have fruit out of season.  I've heard people say, well, Jesus had bad days.  He cursed the fig tree because he was just in a bad mood.  No, he's the only one who has the right to expect fruit of the impossible.  and bearing fruit out of season.  God's trying to remove our excuse of the seasons because we're a people that live from heavenly realms toward earthly realms.  And in heaven, the trees bear fruit 12 months of the year.  So the Lord is working to get us to live in that sense of indebtedness to where we can bring before him fruit.  You entrusted me with the spirit that raised you from the dead.  Here's what I did with it.  But I also live with a sense of indebtedness to the world Because I believe that I owe them an encounter with God and the church.  I live with an indebtedness to people.  I owe them an encounter with God in the most certain way.  to be used by God to bring others into a divine encounter is to be full of the Spirit.  See, the Holy Spirit's in all of us, but he doesn't rest upon all of us.  So I want to learn how to host the presence so that he rests upon.  It says that Jesus says, the Holy Spirit came upon him in the form of a dove and remained.  So how do you walk around a room if you've got a dove on your shoulder and you don't want him to leave?  You walk around with every step as with the dove in mind.  Every move you make is with Him in mind because you don't want in the natural, you wouldn't want that dove to fly away.  The strength of that verse was the Spirit of God came in the form of a dove and remained.  So that's the burden of my heart is to learn how to live in a way that I host the presence of the Lord like that, that I bring others with words, with prayer, with touch, with decrees, that I can release the reality of God's presence over people's lives and bring them into a divine encounter, because it's always been about Him, it's not about us, and to be full of God.  And I really believe that it continues here because he found people that were willing to do anything.  They were willing to take a bullet for the presence.  They were willing to do anything to maintain that sense of hosting the glory of God.  And that's the thing that just excites me more than anything else in life is that it's all about us learning to carry, to host the presence, the glorious presence of King Jesus.  One of the privileges that I have doing is I get to go to some of the Catch the Fire events and Catch the Wave, which is an amazing event.  We get to catch something wherever we go.  And it's really been a treat to partner with what God is doing here that you guys are exporting all over the world and to step in line to that anointing that you guys carry for exporting to step into that anointing you guys have and to come under, so to speak, and to serve the various nations or groups of people.  That's been amazing to me.  And I always try to, when I get an invitation to catch the fire or catch the wave, I always try to prioritize that if it's at all possible because I just love to be a part of what's happening here and what's happening from here.  So we have very, very strong appreciation, thankfulness, affection for Toronto, for Airport Christian Fellowship, for Catch the Fire, and everything else, the other million things that you're doing.  We just like it all and are just your biggest fans.  So we're glad we get to participate.  Bless you for that, too.  Thanks. ",
