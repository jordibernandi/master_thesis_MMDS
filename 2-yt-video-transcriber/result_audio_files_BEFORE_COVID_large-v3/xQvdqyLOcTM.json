            "text": "Hey guys, Laura Loomer here.  So I'm inside my hotel room here at the Hilton in Woodland Hills, California, where CARE, the Council on American Islamic Relations, a designated Islamic terrorist organization tied to Hamas, is having their banquet today.  I really wanted to make sure that I got front row access to these jihadists and terrorist sympathizers who are hosting this event.  People like Ilhan Omar and Hassan Shibley, who's currently representing the ISIS bride, who's trying to come back into America.  the democrats right in their opposition to israel because they are so anti-jewish and have decided that they would rather stand with ilhan omar and muslim women in congress instead of speaking out against jew hatred have canceled their appearances at aipac right.  so i think that it's a crisis.  it's an emergency in this country and i know that woodland hills california has a large jewish population and i'm really looking forward to meeting a lot of the jewish protesters here today.  MP Omar!  MP Omar!  MP Omar!  MP Omar!  MP Omar!  So as you know, CARE is a designated Islamic terrorist organization.  Ilhan Omar spews vile Jew hatred.  She has ties to Hamas.  She has refused to condemn Hamas.  She has advocated on behalf of members of ISIS.  And the Hilton is hosting her.  She is being hosted inside the Hilton, even though she has advocated for ISIS terrorists.  And so obviously, Woodland Hills has a very large Jewish population, and they're not too happy about this.  So we have a lot of protesters across the street with some Holocaust imagery, never again, American flags, Israeli flags.  A lot of people are angry that a terrorist convention is taking place here in their community.  So we're going to go talk to some of these protesters.  Listen, media, listen, listen.  From the desert to the sea, Israel will always be like the past.  See, Israel will always be.  Shame on Israel!  Shame on Israel!  Shame on Israel!  USA!  USA!  USA!  USA!  USA!  USA!  USA!  USA!  USA!  I have read Koran many many times and we need to read Koran.  So we know how bad that book is.  Full of hatred.  And she took her oath on it.  Left hand on the Koran, mouth proclaiming allegiance to our Constitution.  Give me a break.  It's incompatible.  Sharia law is incompatible with the United States Constitution.  And you're right, Islam isn't a religion.  So when they like to say they want to take their oath on the Quran and its freedom of religion, it is an ideology, a supremacist ideology that calls for the killing of all non-Muslims and its only desire is to conquer and force those who do not practice to submit.  Don't forget one thing.  Quran is mine comes in Arabic.  Hey, how's it going?  Good.  How are you?  Good.  I brought a sign here.  Sharia.  Free USA.  I like it. ",

The Council on American Islamic Relations, otherwise known as CARE, likes to describe itself as the nation's leading Muslim civil rights organization.  But what they fail to mention is the fact that they're actually a designated Islamic terrorist organization.  You know, in the United Arab Emirates, they have been designated as a terrorist organization.  And here in the United States of America, during the Holy Land Foundation terrorism trial, which was our country's largest terrorism trial ever in U.S.  history, federal judges found that there was ample evidence tying CAIR to Hamas.  And no, I'm not talking about the dip you eat with pita bread.  I'm talking about Hamas, the Islamic terrorist organization that is recognized as such by the United States State Department.  Yes, these pesky little facts that people like Congresswoman Ilhan Omar and people like Nihal Awad, the director of CARE, and their associate, Hassan Shibley, the executive director of CARE, who is in charge of CARE Florida, which is CARE's largest chapter here in the United States.  These are the people who were welcomed to Woodland Hills, California inside the Hilton.  These are the people who Congresswoman Ilhan Omar is associating with.  This woman who is speaking at a banquet, at a fundraiser for a terrorist organization that is advocating on behalf of the Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas and members of ISIS overseas, she has access to our classified information.  Kind of makes you wonder what she's doing with our information, right? ",

These are the same people who lobbied Twitter and Facebook to ban me, right?  As reported by the Wall Street Journal.  These are the same people who are now trying to get Judge Jeanine Pirro and Tucker Carlson fired from Fox News.  So of course they're going to throw me out.  Who knows if I'll get thrown out of the hotel venue, but I'll definitely probably get thrown out of the banquet.  But I'm looking forward to it, you know, because somebody needs to speak truth to power and these people need to be held accountable and confronted for their associations to terrorist organizations and their blatant Jew hatred, Christian hatred, and anti-American sentiments.  Hi, I'm a guest here at the Hilton.  Are you guys aware that this is a terrorist fundraiser?  This is a terrorist organization?  Thumbs up to terrorism?  Thumbs up to Hamas?  It's a terrorist organization.  Are you guys aware?  Does anybody care?  Where are you guys from?  From Illumina, Haiti.  My name's Laura Lumer.  Hi.  Hi, nice to meet you.  How's it going?  Good.  Gene Fields would care.  Great.  You have Hassan Chivli speaking tonight.  And I know Hassan Chivli is currently representing the ISIS bride who's trying to come back into America.  And then you have a lot of your speakers and a lot of your people who come to your events, people like Siraj Wahaj, Linda Sarsour.  They're open supporters of Hamas.  And even Siraj himself is a co-conspirator in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing.  Do you think it's appropriate to be having a fundraiser for terrorists?  Are you aware that you're working for an Islamic terrorist organization?  Ma'am, I just am here to work with the credit media.  No, I understand.  And I really appreciate you being so kind to answer my questions.  I know who you are, ma'am.  I know you guys know who I am because you guys lobbied Twitter to ban me.  So I think it's really interesting.  You should really know the type of organization that you're working for.  And the group that you're working for, CARE, is a terrorist organization.  Thank you for stopping by.  Okay, well.  Do you know this is a terrorist organization?  Are you aware of it?  Are you invited?  I'm not a guest at the hotel.  This is a terrorist organization.  This is a private property.  You need to leave.  I'm a guest at the hotel.  I'm supporting Hamas.  Okay?  Ilhan, Ilhan Omar, Ilhan Omar supports Hamas.  He is a vile Jew here and these people are supporting Islamic terrorism in America. ",
