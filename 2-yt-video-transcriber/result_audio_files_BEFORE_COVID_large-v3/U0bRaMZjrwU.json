So it's about $5,000 a month.  So the electric companies tend to report, hey, this place has a $5,000 a month electric bill.  That's kind of high.  Well, to avoid that, you go around the meter and then you don't have to pay any electric bill and you get all free electricity.  Rick, that sounds like whatever.
