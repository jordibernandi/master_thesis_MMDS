            "text": "Stirring the coffee with chopsticks, using the vortex method, the only true way to optimize the taste of your coffee at the molecular level.  Good morning.  Welcome to the Daybreak Show.  I am the Sultan.  We'll get started, but first, coffee.  Mmm, juicy fruit.  Spelling is important.  There's a difference between I love taking walks, wine and snuggling and I love taking walks, wine and smuggling.  A chain is only as strong as its weakest link.  Getting to know Tate speech, Cobra Tate, Andrew Tate, has been fun.  Also seeing a different side of Paul Joseph Watson recently.  Even as an older dude, I get inspired by younger dudes.  Be able to inspire up and down.  be able to get inspired up and down.  Let nothing stop you from getting inspired.  Let nothing stop you from inspiring anyone older than you or younger than you.  Age up, age down.  The first rule of the Manosphere is You don't talk about the manosphere.  The second rule of the manosphere is you don't talk about the manosphere.  Does anyone else love looking at their pets sleeping, curled up in a ray of sunshine at a certain time of day?  It's somewhat satisfying knowing they feel safe and that they can just sprawl out.  It reminds me of quietly standing in the doorway of my children when they were either in their cribs or in their beds.  And you stand in the doorway just to hear a little bit of breathing.  And then you walk away quietly.  There's something very satisfying about that.  Learn to work the saxophone.  I play just what I feel.  Drink scotch whiskey all night long.  And die behind the wheel.  They got a name for the winners in the world.  I want a name when I lose.  They call Alabama the Crimson Tide.  Call me.  And I took a poll.  68% said Deacon Blues.  6% said Moves Like Jagger.  6% said New York Times and 20% said Nibiru.  Only entertain assets.  Never entertain a liability.  It's the seed of a trouble tree.  Imagine if there was a thing called a trouble tree and you had seeds.  Where would you plant those seeds?  Because that tree is going to bear fruit forever.  Learn to trust yourself by yourself.  Monitor your addiction to disappointment.  Major, major issue that many people have.  You are addicted to disappointment.  And I want you to think about that.  How in your life have you been addicted to disappointment?  where you almost bring it on and are drawn to it and attract it and propagate it.  If you want action and adventure, go to where the action and adventure is.  You don't need to invite it into your front door.  To the divorced and or widowed, stay single develop clarity.  any arrangement that looks like a relationship too soon is going to cloud your purpose and always has an expiration date on it.  but you refuse and are probably unable to see the expiration date although to others it's very clear.  Gentlemen, let me just give you a little tip about ladies.  They do have an expiration date.  If you look behind their right ear, like right around here, men don't have it.  Women have an expiration date.  It's right about here.  Look for it.  If she's sleeping or looking the other way, just look here and you'll see the expiration date.  She'll be like, what are you doing?  You're like, nothing.  I just love your hair.  What you're really doing is looking for the code that tells you when it's going to go sour.  It's not the big that eat the small, but the fast that eat the slow.  Momentum is what makes you unstoppable or harder to stop or to slow down.  Without momentum, you can lose interest even in your own endeavors.  You need momentum.  Business, money, relationships.  You need momentum.  I don't drink alcohol anymore.  I freeze it like a popsicle and eat it.  Dean Martin I bet there's rich folks eating in a fancy dining car.  They're probably drinking coffee and smoking big cigars.  Johnny Cash 1955.  In the 1940s, everything that Nazi Germany did was legal in that country.  At that time, they passed laws making everything they did legal.  They used social disapproval, social justice, and shaming at first, at first, to silence the dissenters.  People just went along just to avoid being targeted as a dissenter.  Remember the truth is edgy.  There's going to come a time when there are harsh consequences for speaking the truth.  George Orwell stated something like that.  In every society, on its downturn, the truth will be suppressed and will be a crime.  That's one of the sure signs that a society, that a civilization is about to become uncivil.  What is the best side hustle that you ever heard of?  Please put your comments down below.  I would love to hear what the best side hustle, cash hustle that you ever heard is.  Here's a letter from a viewer.  I've been meaning to write you since late last year to give my heartfelt thanks for your channel and brilliant content.  You are the best YouTube channel on YouTube.  I have skipped around many channels for years.  Your message of getting unstuck is the first one that has truly struck home.  I love the fact that you stay with that theme alongside a remarkable breadth and depth.  There also feels something especially integrating about quoting song lyrics from the past.  I dig that too.  Adam, you're getting it.  You are getting it.  You're seeing the connection.  There's not a lot of randomness here.  And thank you for pointing that out.  I also resonate with the theme of solitude.  Right now, my main goal is around stabilizing sleep and keeping more regular hours.  Good man.  I have previously had bigger, more elaborate plans and ideas, but I currently see more clearly that I need to start with the basics of that.  Although I have also upped my exercise regime and improved my diet, I could write more and maybe will another time.  With much respect and gratitude, Adam.  From England, UK.  Adam, I welcome intelligent emails like that.  Thank you, sir.  Please stay in touch.  Now, let's get to something important.  This one is for men, although women may be able to use it.  And it's how to vet a woman like a jedi.  like someone said when you see the hood on i'm in jedi mode.  vetting a woman means judging doing a check a background check.  it's not a test.  what it is is you're looking for things that might be red flags.  I should have some red flags here to wave.  Nine times out of 10, any relationship that you had in the past that failed, that had the expiration date on it, had red flags or a light on the dashboard, a check engine light that you ignored.  In the same way that you ignore a check engine light, And that car, that engine, will eventually take a shit in the future because you ignored the check engine light.  Relationships are the same way.  Your relationship will take a shit if you ignore these things.  This is what I want you to look for.  What is her input?  What is going into her brain?  Men, this is for you.  Look at me, dude.  Look at me.  Put your coffee down.  What is she putting in her mind?  Is she watching too much television?  Does she read?  What does she listen to?  What is the data that is going into her head?  Because garbage in, garbage will come out.  Not only out of the mouth, but out of the actions.  If all she watches on TV is the Real Housewives of Timbuktu and The Bachelor, The Bachelorette, and things like that, you are fucked.  If all she reads is People Magazine celebrity gossip, and not stretch her mind and creating new neural pathways with books, information, stories, you are fucked.  Eventually, that is a bad seed that will become a tree that will bear bad fruit in the relationship in the future.  So input, watch the input.  Number two, I'm going to give you three things, is the output.  What is she showing you?  Because what she does is more important and speaks louder than what she says.  If she says, I never watch TV.  And then you find her watching TV.  Interesting.  Very interesting.  What she's doing is different than what she says.  Gentlemen, believe what she does, not what she says.  Take the blinders off, put on the red lens, and you will not be able to unsee these things.  What comes out of her mouth?  Is there cursing?  Is there hate?  Is there poison?  Do you feel uplifted in her presence?  Even though you are your own mental point of origin, there's nothing like a partner that makes you feel strong, tall.  You feel good about yourself.  Even though you are not looking for somebody to validate you, you are not looking for someone to unvalidate you because you are your own mental point of origin.  your own locus of control.  But you know what?  It's nice to be thrown a bone every now and then because there's days that you're not going to want to go to the gym or eat healthy.  And she says something encouraging.  I'll go to the gym with you.  Let's take a walk together.  I'm going to make us something healthy to eat.  What comes out of her mouth?  Do curse words and profanity come out of her mouth?  There's a huge difference if you're around someone who talks like a sailor.  No disrespect to sailors.  And then you talk to someone who speaks lovely words, encouraging words, words of construction, not destruction.  If someone uses... Racial, bad racial words.  There's no... Words themselves mean nothing but the meanings behind the words and the usage behind the words.  The reason, the intent behind the words is important.  What is the output?  What are you seeing come out?  That's number two.  Number three, write these down.  First was input.  What is she putting in her head?  Output.  What is she saying?  What is she doing?  What is coming out of her life?  And number three, are there contradictions?  between what she says and what she does.  That's the first part.  That's 3A.  3B is, are there incongruencies between her life and your life?  Are you changing to fit her lack of growth?  Are you now watching the Real Housewives of Timbuktu with her?  The bad seed was planted, my brother.  It's time to uproot the weed.  What you thought was beautiful is a weed.  And the problem is this.  The prettier the girl... Listen to me, dude.  Listen to me.  I know what you're thinking right now.  The prettier the girl, the less she had to rely on her intellect and her words and her social grace to make it.  In our society right now, beauty trumps everything for a while.  But you can't live on beauty alone.  The last thing you will think about when you are in an argument with her is how beautiful she is, how perky her breasts are, how beautiful that ass is.  I know.  The playmates, the cheerleaders, and the supermodels.  Doors just open for them.  But you will notice they are unhappy as hell.  And it takes time.  It takes two years for crazy to show up.  Six months for a little wackiness to show up.  Anyone can be on their best behavior for six months to a year.  Then it starts to surface.  Gentlemen, this hereby ends my how to vet a woman like a Jedi.  And with that, I'm going to say, finish your coffee, and I will see you tomorrow morning on The Daybreak Show. ",
