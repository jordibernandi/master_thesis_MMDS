Berkeley City Council has unanimously voted to eliminate gender specific words from its municipal code.  The vote was on Tuesday and the idea was introduced by 23-year-old city council member Rigel.  Riggle, Riggle, Roger, Robinson.  He says, language has power.  The words we use are important.  And I say, words have meaning and we should use them accordingly.  Get a load of this list.  Some of the lists on this municipal code.  language that will have changes is pretty impressive.  If you're a brother, literally if you were a brother, you will now be called a sibling.  A craftsman will be an artisan.  Male and female are now people of different genders.  But I thought gender was a social construct.  Manpower is literally becoming human effort.  Seems rather discriminatory to our friends in Area 51.  Want to call a repairman?  No, you don't.  Just a repairer.  And the best, the absolute favorite on this list for me is manhole cover is now A maintenance hole.  Okay, okay.  All right, let me try to get serious here.  What else are we supposed to call it?  Okay, it can't be a manhole cover.  A non-binary function cover?  Oh, oh, oh, I got it.  Cis-hole.  Oh, humanitarian circular cover.  Trans-hole barrier.  Round metal snowflake.  Beta sewage access panel.  Or maybe just, you know, go with the most neutral thing possible and just call it a zurr cover.  Just create a pronoun.  for the manhole cover.  This race to see who is fastest at virtue signaling in every minute detail of culture, I really do hope that a lot of lemmings get behind it and they just run right off the politically correct cliff and let the rest of us get back to living normal life and using words that actually have meaning.  Good day. ",
