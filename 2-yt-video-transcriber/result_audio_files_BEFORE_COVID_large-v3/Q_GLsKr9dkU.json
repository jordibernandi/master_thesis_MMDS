            "text": "Here's my explanation on why I left the police department.  This video is brought to you by The Office Tatum Store.  The Office Tatum Store.  Get your merch link in the description section.  Y'all know what it is.  Let's get into this.  People ask me a thousand times.  Brandon, why did you leave the police department?  Why are you no longer a cop?  Did you get fired?  Did you do something wrong?  Was it too dangerous?  Could you not be a conservative on the police department?  All of the questions have been asked of me and I feel like it's adequate enough for me to make a video so you can share it with your friends and everybody can know and I can answer all your questions on this video.  No, I did not get fired.  And no, it wasn't because I couldn't be a conservative on the police department.  Actually, on the Tucson Police Department, which is the department that I worked for, they loved me.  Everybody loved me.  Everybody loved B. Tatum.  Everybody, I was the voice of the police department.  They wanted something said about the chief.  They wanted something said about white privilege.  They wanted something said about the tax on law enforcement.  B. Tatum making a video.  commanders all the way up to right under the chief because our chief was a super SJW, super SJW.  I'm going to tell you how much SJW is.  Just imagine.  He held up a Black Lives Matter sign as the chief in Richmond, California.  He also is married to another man.  So that tells you, that's almost the most liberal, the liberal leftist starter kid.  And he cannot even stand police officers.  But he's the police chief of Tucson Police Department.  I cannot stand that man.  Now, back to my explanation.  So it wasn't none of those negative things.  It really had nothing to do with that.  So the full story is that I made videos in 2015 or 2016 about President Trump.  And it all started.  And let me say this.  Let me go back.  Let me go back.  I never made a video before.  I never made any videos.  All I would do, because I've always been outspoken, most of the things I would talk about on my Facebook was about God.  And so I would normally just post and write something on Facebook about what I was feeling or something to say.  And maybe like 100 people would like it, which was a lot of people for me.  That was a whole lot of people, a whole lot of folk.  So 100 people would like it, and I'm like... That's great.  So I started going from being a Democrat to being more conservative after I started seeing Obama dislike the police department and say negative things and really create an environment where our job was way more dangerous.  And all of my police friends were like, bro, you're not a Democrat.  I don't know why you think you're Democrat.  You're a Christian.  You're pro-law enforcement.  You believe in pro-life.  You know, all these other things.  You're not a Democrat.  And then I finally opened my eyes to seeing that.  So as a police officer and seeing that and coming out of the, you know, the scales fall out my eyes.  I said, let me go to this Trump rally.  I was a Ben Carson guy at first.  And then I said, you know what?  Ben Carson dropped out.  He supported Trump.  I was like, man, let me go see if this guy's even serious.  He's in Tucson.  I go to the event.  Most of y'all know the story.  I make this video about my experience, simply my experience.  Posted it online.  It went viral.  I thought I was going to get fired.  Because millions of people was watching that video, and I thought it was just going to be a couple hundred people that always comment on my stuff.  Went viral.  I was on the Hannity Show.  Or at least they asked me to be on the Hannity Show.  O'Reilly, when he was still on.  Fox and Friends.  I was on a few of them that they already set out.  Then the Brussels attack happened.  The attack in Brussels.  And so they had to cover that story.  So they canceled all of my appearances.  Only one that stayed was Fox and Friends.  So I was at work.  I was on the job, ladies and gentlemen.  And I had, I told my boss, can I take off for two hours and I'll come back.  So I took leave for two hours and I went, the hit was like 2 a.m.  Arizona time.  I went in the locker room, took my uniform off, dressed up, went to the studio, recorded, came back, went back on patrol.  Some people probably recognize me, you know what I'm saying?  They like, oh, he was just on TV, bro, what the heck?  So that's kind of how it started.  And then I was like, look, I'm going to stay a police officer.  I have no desire to be anything else.  I'm going to be a police officer.  I went to school to get my master's degree so I could be a police chief.  That was me.  I kept making videos.  I kept being the life of the police department.  And then one day, Colin Kaepernick, Mr.  Colin Kaepernick himself.  If I could thank you for anything, the only thing that good that came from him taking a knee was that it changed my life.  You know what I'm saying?  Because I ripped his behind so bad.  So bad.  That that video had 70 million views on Facebook.  It was like 14 million on my page and there was a page called Newly Pressed.  They ripped my video, didn't even give me... Yeah, I think they gave me credit for that one because they ripped a couple of my other videos that got millions of followers.  millions of views.  and then they ripped this one.  they gave me credit for it.  it had 40 plus million on their channel.  and then you know other people.  i calculated all of them and i know i missed a bunch.  i calculated at least 70 million views.  so when that happened it was it was big time right.  i had organizations that wanted me to be the spokesperson of them or whatever.  i left the police department, and I was the spokesperson of a company called Conservative Tribune, Liftable Media, Conservative Tribune, Western Journal.  A lot of y'all probably know who they are.  I was a spokesperson of one of their sub internet online news stations.  And the funny thing is, is that I didn't really think that I would do that.  I felt like You know what?  I'm going to try it out.  I'm going to be honest, man.  They were offering me financial packets that I couldn't refuse.  You know what I'm saying?  Dang near.  I'm going to be honest with y'all.  I made almost 20K more there than I did as a police officer.  And my signing bonus with them was almost more than I made in a year as a police officer.  I couldn't refuse that.  And so I was like, I'll try for a year.  Take a break.  I'm still a certified police officer.  And if I don't like it, I'm going to go back to patrol.  And then God began to open up things for me.  I ended up going with Turning Point USA.  Y'all know Candace Owens, Charlie Kirk.  It blew up.  I was speaking around the country.  My social media was growing.  I mean, things were just going, and I'm like, this is God showing me that he want me to expand and to go in a different direction and do more things and be more vocal and be able to change the world, not just in one sector of the Tucson area between... Nine at night and seven in the morning.  You know, I can change the world physically, be there, talk to people, meet people, create foundations and things like that.  I think God was taking me in that direction.  And I'm really grateful that God has done that.  And that has led me to where I'm at now.  I have my own online store, The Officer Tatum Store.  This YouTube channel, your support on this channel really helps me out.  I got a whole bunch of other business ventures.  I got a non-profit organization that I'm getting ready to launch and I'm going to tell you guys all about it.  It took me a while to get it in the works.  I want to make sure I iron out everything before I tell you about it.  I do a lot of stuff.  I speak around the country.  If you're interested in hearing me speak, booking at TheOfficerTatum.com.  Booking at TheOfficerTatum.com.  It's in the description section.  I do a lot of stuff, man.  I'm an entrepreneur.  Capitalism is the way to go, man.  I want to own my own private jet.  I want to be a millionaire.  I do.  And I want to be able to make so much money that I could just give money away enough to change people's lives and not even think twice about it.  Even if I thought twice about it, I'd be able to impact people's lives with the amount of blessings that God has given me.  Not so I can sit up on a high horse and do nothing, but so that I can give away thousands of dollars, hundreds, you know, tens of thousands of dollars just because.  You know what I'm saying?  Just because somebody needs a scholarship, I can go and bless them.  stuff that I couldn't do if I was only making minimum wage.  Y'all know what it is.  So anyway, that's my story about how I became or why I'm not a police officer anymore, how I got to this point.  I left some stuff out here and there.  I'll make other videos.
