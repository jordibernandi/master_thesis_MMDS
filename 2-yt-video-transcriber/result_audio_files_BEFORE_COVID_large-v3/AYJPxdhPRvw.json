            "text": "Yep, that little red dumbfounded emoji is something you never want to see when you are searching for one of your videos.  I woke up the other morning to find an email telling me how unfortunate it was that my video of last Saturday, the 5th of October, had been taken down by YouTube.  And perhaps you saw it, but if not, it was a video review of Ott or Otti or Autumn Boshoff of CRC Church in South Africa.  Now, I produce my videos under the fair use section of the U.S.  federal copyright law, which allows me to use clips of other people's material for the purpose of critique and teaching.  I always put this slide up as a reminder of that fact.  And this is how I started last week's video.  Unhealthy rubbish.  Hello, Bezel T3.  That was at Boshoff at Christian Revival Church, or CRC, in South Africa, talking about getting used to being in first class and eating like a king.  CRC boasts over 90 locations in South Africa, as well as other international locations.  Okay, now here's some of the information that YouTube provides when this happens.  The video duration, the video title, part of the video description, the reason for the removal, the publish date, the number of views at the time of removal.  In this case, I had just over 5,000.  Can't remember what that zero is for.  And finally, the number of likes.  Now, it's clear as day that it was CRC who contacted YouTube and claimed copyright infringement and requested that the video be taken down.  Now, YouTube is in the business of hosting videos, not getting involved in legal disputes over copyright law, so they will always err on the side of the content owner, and rightly so.  My options are, one, to dispute the copyright claim on the grounds of fair use, which could be messy and very expensive.  both of which are not good options.  Or I can contact the content owner and request that they remove their claim.  So because I couldn't seem to find any contact email information on the CRC website, I used the one that was listed here.  This is what I wrote them.  Hello, I'm contacting you because you have taken action against a video I posted on YouTube.  I review sermons and look at non-Christian religions as well.  The review I did of your church called Priority Status showed the prosperity gospel underpinnings that run through a lot of your pastor's sermons.  This kind of teaching is, in my opinion, another gospel.  I am passionate about the true gospel of Jesus Christ and that is why I do what I do.  I am a very small contributor on YouTube, and for you to take the time to contact them and demand to have my video taken down is quite curious.  The only other time this has happened is when an organization felt like my critique threatened them financially.  I respectfully ask that you withdraw your copyright claim and allow people to judge for themselves.  If what you are doing is of God, then... What I have to say should not matter in the least.  Sound theology should be able to withstand criticism.  Your reaction to my video indicates otherwise.  For God in his glory, Bezel T3.  Well, not surprisingly, they never got back to me.  Now here's the thing.  I am an absolute nobody on YouTube.  I have a 10-year-old channel with over 500 videos and about around 13,000 subscribers over 10 years.  My average video now hovers around, I don't know, the 2,500, 3,000 views a month, which compared to some on YouTube is above average, but compared to others is absolutely minuscule.  And as you saw, this video had garnered 5,000 and a little bit views worldwide in three days, which is pretty good for me, but compared to the size of CRC's Sunday church attendance, the views on my videos seem almost irrelevant.  So for a church with the size, scope, and influence of CRC to even notice little old me, let alone feel vulnerable enough by what I said in my critique of Addy Bashaw, to demand to have my video taken down is strange.  Or as they say in Zulu, manga zayo.  I think that's how it says it.  It's strange in Zulu.  So why did CRC take my video down?  The only other time this has happened is when I did a video on a guy by the name of Daryl Anka.  I think he's the brother of Paul Anka, who parades around giving paid lectures, pretending to channel an extraterrestrial named Bashar, who is an intergalactic sky pilot and part-time wise sage.  the people that go to us, but I went to one of his, his, uh, lectures that was local.  And I went right after it was done and watched them sell their trinkets outside this small little venue they had.  And these people, I mean, they're, they're wearing, you know, pyramid hats.  It's like that movie independence day where the, the crazy people that were waiting for the, uh, extraterrestrials to beam them up or on top of a high rise and the A spaceship comes over them and they're going, beam me up, beam me up.  And then they get absolutely blasted by the spaceship as it utterly destroys the high rise they were standing on.  But anyways, is the leadership of CRC so thin skin that they can't take anyone criticizing their head pastor?  Or are they actually concerned that my video would harm them financially?  Or is it more than that?  Could it be that I am shining God's light into the darkness of Ott Boschoff's truth mixed with error?  prosperity gospel?  I mean, really, my video shouldn't have bothered CRC any more than a gnat on the back of an elephant.  And yet here we are with a video taken down and Bezel T3's channel blemished with a copyright strike.  That won't go away until January 5th, 2020.  And after three copyright strikes, my account that I have spent thousands of hours to establish would be wiped out in an instant.  So this I take very seriously.  So for those of you who did not see the video in question, here are some of my comments.  And I will now speak the words of Ott Boschoff for obvious reasons.  For a church with such a ubiquitous presence, I'm a little embarrassed that I've never heard of AT or ADDIE or CRC before.  But here's where I so appreciate the subscribers of this channel to give me the heads up on Christian personalities and current trends out there.  CRC likes big buildings.  Here's an enlargement of their site in Johannesburg, South Africa, complete with a spiral walkway and a subterranean parking lot with over 1,200 spaces.  Pretty impressive stuff.  Addy is also a prophet of sorts.  This was his New Year's prophecy for 2019.  2019 will be a year of glory for my house, for my church, and for our country.  2019 will be a year of glory.  We are going to see the pain and suffering of South Africa alleviated.  We are going to see poverty eradicated.  Poverty eradicated?  Well, the latest 2019 numbers tell us that almost 28% of the South African population are living on less than 25 rands a month.  Now, that comes out to about $165 US.  The unemployment level in 2019 is hovering around 29%.  Well, now it's October, so if God is going to eradicate poverty in South Africa, he better get cracking.  You know, false prophecies point to a false prophet, and a false prophet equals a false teacher of the Bible every time.  Now, we've talked about the anti-Christian idea of the law of attraction before.  Well, guess what?  Why do good things happen to good people and bad things happen to bad people?  Why?  You know, the better question is, why do good things happen to bad people and bad things happen to good people?  You know, it's the cry of Asaph in Psalm 73.  He wrote, For I was envious of the arrogant when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.  For they have no pangs until death.  Their bodies are fat and sleek.  They are in no trouble as others are.  Whether you know it or not, whether you like it or not, you are attracting things into your life all the time, good or bad, wanted or unwanted, all the time.  Now, what we've seen so far is enough of a warning that everyone who goes to CRC should head for the exits and don't look back.  But that was almost 10 years ago that he did that law of attraction thing.  Perhaps that has changed his ways.  So let's look at a recent sermon entitled Priority Status.  Now really, what's a sermon without pithy little slogans?  At is going to be using Ephesians chapter 2 verses 1 through 10, but we'll focus on verse 7 and how Christians can be seated in first class rather than in the baggage compartment.  If you've ever flown, you know it's better to fly here, rather than fly over here in the baggage compartment.  This is where a lot of Christians are, in the baggage compartment.  That looks like a heap of trash to me.  A baggage compartment looks like this.  It has luggage in it.  His text is Ephesians 2, 1 through 10, but he focuses on verse 7, and he asks this question, Where are you sitting?  Where are you sitting?  Are you sitting in first class, or in the baggage compartment, or in the trash heap?  Is he talking to Christians or non-believers or both?  It's rather unclear.  A lot of people are sitting among the baggage and they talk about their hurts and their past and their mess-ups and their mistakes and they carry a lot of stench around them.  Now you can see how this is all geared to the here and now.  Now, there is an important now aspect to Paul's words.  Christians are presently seated with Christ in glory, spiritually, in spite of one's present circumstances.  Paul's intent is to show that what happened to Jesus in his death, bodily resurrection, and ascension to the Father's right hand has implications for the Christian both presently and in the future because of the vital impact intimate union they have with Christ Jesus.  But at is going to focus on God wanting you to have your best life now.  And then he says, I used to fly in the cattle car where people smoked.  And then I had to sit as a Christian.  And then he says, pray.  And then I did this.  Not quite sure what that was all about, but I know one thing, it wasn't preaching.  Anybody ever had a thought like that?  It's not for me.  This is too good for me.  This girl is too pretty for me.  This job is too good for me.  This car is too good for me.  This vacation is too good for me.  Well, I used to think exactly the same.  So what changed, Addy, that now you think nothing in this world is too good for you?  He says, you have to study the boarding pass.  You need to study the law of liberty.  You have to study God's word so you can see what your added benefits are.  Added benefits?  Pretty girls, good jobs, nice cars, vacations?  Folks, that's code language for the law of attraction.  Here it seems that Ad is saying that there are two categories of Christians.  Those who fly first class and those who stay in the baggage compartment.  This is where the church is struggling.  We get out of the baggage, but some people still go back to the baggage.  I miss that girl, but that girl's not saved.  That doesn't matter.  I'm going to get her saved.  Well, you haven't been able to get her saved in three years.  Clickety-click, wiggity-wick, wick-wick-wick, wiggity-wiggity-wiggity.  Don't picky-picky.  Don't mean-see-ween-see.  You know, it astounds me that Att can talk to an audience of thousands and thousands and insinuate that either you are not a Christian or at least you're not a first-class Christian.  You know, if he were to actually preach the Word of God to the people of God and let the non-believers listen in, as it were... we would be hearing about how the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ has blessed us Christians in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly realms.  All over this place, if you have raised your hands, we want to pray for you in front where the altar is.  The altar?  You mean the place where animals are sacrificed?  Well, no.  He means the altar call.  It comes from the Second Great Awakening and what Charles Finney first called the anxious bench.  People would get so emotionally fired up by the preacher, talking fast and furious.  Sound familiar?  And they would then come down in front, repeat a quick prayer, and think that they are now able to fly first class.  Here are some sobering words from R.C.  Sproul.  He said this, The sad abuse of the altar call is that it gives multitudes of people a false sense of security who think they're saved because they raised their hand or prayed a prayer or walked an aisle.  Jesus warned again and again, Many will come to me on the last day saying, Lord, Lord, didn't we do this or that?  And he will say, Depart from me, you workers of iniquity.  I never knew you.  You're not justified by a profession of faith.  You're justified by a possession of it.  And you can't manipulate that.  Only the Holy Spirit can convert.  Only the Holy Spirit can change the disposition of the soul and regenerate that person who is dead in sins and trespasses.  We can't force that.  And when we do, we put people at everlasting peril when we give them a false sense of security.  Okay, then At leaves the stage.  Perhaps he's late for a lunch engagement or a first-class flight out of town.  And he sends in a closer to deal with the minions.  You know, Ephesians 2, 1 through 10 was, to continue the aviation metaphor, hijacked by At-Bashoth, and God was not glorified.  But rather, he used it to bring in more people who want to have their ears tickled.  Remember Paul's words to Timothy.  He wrote, Now let's review Paul's progression in chapters 1 and 2 of Ephesians.  We start in chapter 1, verses 3 through 6.  Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly realms.  For he chose us in him before the foundation of the world to be holy and blameless in his presence.  In love, he predestined us for adoption as his sons through Jesus Christ, according to the good pleasure of his will.  to the praise of his glorious grace, which he has freely given us in the beloved one.  You know, Jesus says the very same thing in the gospels.  He says, you did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed that you should go and bear fruit and that your fruit should abide.  Chapter one, verse 11.  In him, we were also chosen as God's own, having been predestined according to the plan of him who works out everything by the counsel of his will.  And then, as we said before, Paul is careful to remind Christians from whence they came.  Chapter 2, verse 1.  As for you, you were dead in your trespasses and sin.  Now, that's the bad news.  But then the good news.  Chapter 2, verses 4 through 10.  Verse 1.  But God, those are the two most encouraging words perhaps in the entire New Testament.  But God, being rich in mercy because of the great love with which he loved us, even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ.  By grace you have been saved.  See, it's God who made us alive, not we ourselves by walking to the front of a megachurch.  He goes on, and raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, so that in the coming ages he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace and kindness towards us in Christ Jesus.  For by grace, he says it again, for by grace you have been saved through faith.  And this is not your own doing.  It is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no man may boast.  At Boshoff and CRC is soft-pedaled prosperity gospel, word of faith, law of attraction nonsense.  It's another gospel completely, which Paul says in Galatians is no gospel at all.  Anyone who wants to grow in God's grace needs to flee CRC as if the building were on fire and find a church where the true gospel of God's Son is embraced and proclaimed. ",
