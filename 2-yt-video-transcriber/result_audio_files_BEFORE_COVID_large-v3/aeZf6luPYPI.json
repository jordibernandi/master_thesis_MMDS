            "text": "The Atheist Debates Patreon Project presents Questions from Patrons, March 2019.  Hi everybody, how you doing?  Once again, this is going out to everybody, but a special thank you to the patrons who support this project, the patreon.com slash atheist debates project.  And if you have questions that you'd like me to address, feel free to send them in.  You don't have to be a patron to get your question addressed.  But it might help.  normally when patrons send in questions I put them together a list and then either construct whole videos about them if they are You know big questions that might require a lot of thought or just post them like I'm doing today.  And today we have two questions that are somewhat related from one patron named Mitch and so thank you Mitch.  and for the rest of the patrons you can submit your questions here as well.  So I'm going to skip over the flattering portions of the email, although I greatly appreciate it, and get right to the meat of this.  Mitch writes, I have two thoughts I would love to hear you address someday.  First, when folks call in with creation needs a creator arguments, why don't you counter them with who created God more often?  And the second question is about building on common ground.  It's supposed to be highly persuasive, but I have a hard time doing it.  Can't even think of decent ways to do it.  Is there anything you've found that works a little?  So yes, let's start with the first one because this is something that's come up quite a bit.  It's a fairly standard apologetic that I think gained popularity at least in the last decade or so because Ray Comfort would use it in many of his videos.  that creation needs a creator.  And the first thing to note is that they don't tend to say a creation or a creation needs a creator, which is the truth.  If we have something that is a creation, we know that it requires a creator.  That's the reason that we called it a creation.  And that's the dishonesty in the argument that they're presenting.  because they're looking at reality the universe, the cosmos, life,  etc.,  and calling it a creation in order to claim that it needs a creator, when the truth is we don't get to call something a creation until we've demonstrated reasonably that it does in fact have a creator.  A painting requires a painter.  A building requires a builder.  Yes, a thought requires a thinker.  I'm in agreement with all those.  But if you come across something that appears to be a structure, you don't get to just call it a building until you can identify that it was in fact built.  Was a cave built?  And the extended problem with this is that you're looking around at everything and saying that all of it was created.  And the way we recognize creations and designs are that there's no good evidence that they occur naturally.  and an overwhelming collection of evidence that they are the result of thinking agents doing things.  We know that paintings were painted because we can look at paintings, see the brushstrokes, analyze all the evidence, and determine that it is most probable that this was created by a thinking being.  In our case on Earth.  here, a human is most likely, although I have seen elephants do paintings and other things like that, so you don't want to make too many assumptions.  But we don't just get to look at a splattering of paint or some sort of design appearing out in the wild and say, ah, this looks designed to me, therefore it was designed.  So the first part of that argument, that creation requires a creator, is true and irrelevant, because the way we go about determining that it is a creation is by first identifying that this sort of thing is created and not designed.  And that would require us to be able to compare things.  We have one universe.  We can't compare it to anything else.  You couldn't say, oh, well, we looked at these seven universes, and they're clearly not designed, but ours has some hallmark that makes it more likely that it was designed.  You don't have those for comparison.  You have just one.  And the way we go about figuring things out is through multiple trials.  And by analogy, to say, well, you know, we don't have 53,000 Mona Lisas, but we have countless paintings.  And that, even if we didn't know who painted the Mona Lisa and didn't have good records, it bears all the hallmarks of recognized creations.  The second part of his first question was, when they call in with this, why don't I reply with, well, then who created God?  So first of all, And I am reading that correctly.  He said, then who created God?  I love that because there's already an extra mistake in the question.  And it's one that came up on the show years ago where someone called in and said, if God didn't create the universe, who did?  And by putting a who in there, they are narrowing the options.  Well, if it wasn't God, then it must have been some other thinking agent.  Who is it?  And along those lines, typically, if you were to claim something like universe creating pixies, what you get, as in a recent debate I did, was, oh, well, that's God.  You're just calling it pixies, but it's God.  But the issue here is not who created God, because that would be this chain of who created the God, who created God.  The issue gets more to if a creation requires a creator, then why doesn't God require some sort of creative force or entity or some explanation for its origin?  And the reason I don't bring that up is because in modern theology, this is an incredibly trivial thing to disregard because God is simply defined as being eternal.  And so if something has no beginning, then it is absurd to ask what caused its beginning.  If it turns out that the universe or the cosmos had no beginning, then that will do away with a lot of these questions about, well, what explains the origin of the universe?  If you found something multiverse, if you found something that would be in fact eternal or seemingly eternal or has existed forever, then that's where you stop.  That's where the first cause arguments stop.  which is how they get to a God.  And so if I were to respond to creation requires a creator with something like who created God, that's an argument that's in the same ballpark.  as can God create a rock so big he couldn't lift it?  When the truth is that, at least within Christianity, God isn't described as necessarily omnipotent.  It's not like that word appears in the Bible.  That's an inference, and modern theology has kind of narrowed that such that God has all power that is logically possible so that It does away with these sorts of, can he create a burrito so hot he couldn't eat it, sort of questions.  But that's the reason that I don't come back with, well, then who created God?  Because I have an understanding that by and large, the people I'm talking to, even if they're not aware of it, are part of a religion, part of a particular doctrine that would have God be eternal.  And so asking about God's beginning is absurd.  And the reason I say the people I'm talking to are part of this rather than the people I'm talking to know.  this is because many of them don't.  For many people, just as Mitch sent in with his question, if you were to ask them, well, then who created God?  That's a real problem for them.  And they might have to go off and think about it.  And they might even give up their God belief because they found a really... persuasive argument.  And then some point down the line, they're going to be having a conversation with a theist and they're going to say, oh yeah, well, who created God?  And the theist is going to say, God is eternal.  God has always existed.  And of course, there's a follow-up question to that, which is, how do you know that?  And that's the actual question.  that may be difficult.  Some of them who become aware of this definition of God as eternal know that because somebody told them.  Others feel that it's a logical inference that they've followed a first or a causal chain back to where there must be something eternal and they're just going to call that God.  But the road forks down many different paths once you start having that conversation.  And it's just much better for me to not reply with who made God because I already know where all of the bad potential conclusions of that could be and how they're countered or actually I should probably say the useful conclusions that people can reach and how they're countered.  This notion that God is eternal is essentially an unfalsifiable proposition.  And so it's far better, in my opinion, to go down the road of, oh, how did you come by this information?  Where does your understanding of God and God's nature and characteristics come from?  And how could we possibly demonstrate it?  Because that's the part where all religions have fallen down and given up throughout history.  It's, well, this is what God is, or this is how God's been portrayed or defined, or this is only reasonable.  And yet at the end of the day, they're still wanting to label a creation so they can argue for a creator.  And in a perfect world where they had evidence and argument for it, instead they would say, here is the creator.  We know this because of A, B, and C, and this creator is now the best explanation for the origin of the universe and reality,  etc.,  The second question is different.  It's not about a specific apologetic.  It's about how do you build conversations on common ground?  I've tried to do this over the years on the show and sometimes it's been successful and sometimes it hasn't.  For me, the bigger issue is finding when you've reached a roadblock in the conversation that the person you're talking to simply cannot get past.  You'll see this happen over and over again on the TV show where I will ask a series of questions designed to show a flaw in their reasoning.  And they will give clear answers to some of those questions.  And then as soon as it dawns on them that answering the next question clearly and honestly, like, can faith lead to true and false conclusions?  Yes.  Well, doesn't that mean that faith is then not a reliable pathway to truth?  No, no, not so much.  You see that all the time.  The best thing you can do if you really care about the conversation is to set aside the discussion that you're having at the moment and instead have a secondary discussion that has nothing to do with the religious subject or anything else.  that is about how we would go about defining the truth.  Let's see if we can find the point at which we diverge.  For example, are you and I Sharing a reality.  Do you believe that we're sharing a reality?  I believe that you and I share a reality.  Do you believe this?  If the answer is yes, cool.  Then now we share a reality becomes an agreed upon foundation.  Okay.  If the answer, by the way, is no.  Now you're dealing with someone who is probably going to go down a sort of Saiten-Bruggen-Kate type of route where they say, well, I believe that we're in a shared reality, but I have this God that can justify this and you don't, so your worldview is flawed.  And what they've really done is answered the question with a yes and then made an additional assertion.  If you find somebody that says... they don't think we're actually sharing a reality.  You can have a meta discussion about why they don't think that and how they think the universe actually operates.  And you can look for the ways to find a common ground.  It may be the case that you're just not able to find common ground, but I think that's highly unlikely.  I think in most cases you can at least get to, like for example, Sai and I don't agree on why the logical absolutes are true, but we agree that they are true.  And you would think that this would be a good foundation with which to start.  We have the basis for logical reasoning.  and we go off to have a discussion about what's reasonable.  And whenever this gets uncomfortable, Sai's response is to say, yes, but you can't justify reason and I can't because he thinks that's a way out of it.  Now, granted, it's been several years since I interacted with him at all, but that is at least one way where you can reach common ground.  And then as soon as you lead down in a reductio ad absurdum type of fashion, where you want to use reasoning to show that they're being unreasonable or irrational or contradiction, Then you get this bizarre thing where, yes, we agree on reason, but because you can't have a foundation for it, you can't know.  It's all these red herrings and stuff they're waving around left and right in order to avoid dealing with the reality, which is there's been a demonstration that they're not reasoning correctly.  And so, well, maybe it is a fallacy, but you can't explain why a fallacy is flawed.  Well, I can.  I can explain the problems with fallacies and a syllogism because we've already agreed on the foundations of logic.  Ah, yes, but that requires the law of non-contradiction, and you can't prove that.  Oh, well, I get it.  I understand that, but we're both in agreement that the law of non-contradiction applies, and if I've shown this... I don't want to go through the mock argument left and right, but what you end up with is something that Aron Ross pointed out many times, that they will just fundamentally deny reality.  And this is one of the reasons why we've had people claim that, yes, I'm offering you a circular argument, but it's virtuously circular and not viciously circular.  which is a load of crap because a circular argument is fallacious.  There's nothing virtuous about it at all.  Instead, what they're trying to say is that they are accepting as a presupposition that this position is true.  And if it leads to a circular reasoning fallacy, that's just too bad because it's still true.  And that's about leading the evidence and argument where you want it to go instead of following it where it leads.  Hopefully that gave me some things to think about.  Hopefully some of you others have things to think about as well.  Any patrons that want to submit, you can just use the Patreon messenger system or you can email.  Anybody can email.  And I'm reluctant to give this out, but it's already out in the wild.  So sansdeity at gmail.com gets to me and I'll do my best to answer whatever I can.  I don't think I'll do videos.  where the answer is I don't know unless it offers some additional thoughts along the way.  See you next time.  Bye-bye. ",
