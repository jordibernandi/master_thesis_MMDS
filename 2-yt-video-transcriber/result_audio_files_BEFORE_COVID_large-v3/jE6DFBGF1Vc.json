            "text": "I have long said that Turkey is the number one wild card in the Middle East.  They currently occupy large areas of Cyprus, Syria, and Iraq.  They also have a major military presence in Azerbaijan.  Just yesterday, the Turkish government demanded that the Pentagon provide them with the exact GPS coordinates of all US bases in Rojava.  The Pentagon refused.  Turkey has been threatening an all-out invasion of Rojava for many months now.  A few days ago, Turkish Interior Minister S\u00fcleyman Soylu issued a major threat to the European Union.  Quote, We are facing the biggest wave of migration in history.  If we open the floodgates, no European government will be able to survive for more than six months.  we advise them not to try our patience.  Turkey is attempting to blackmail the European Union and unfortunately I believe this is a serious threat.  To understand what this is all about we have to go back to March 18th 2016.  On that day, Turkey agreed to curb illegal crossings from their nation into Greece.  In exchange, the EU gave Turkey $3 billion to help care for Syrian families staying in Turkey.  They also made other promises.  They agreed to fast-track Turkey for visa liberalization.  What Turkey wants is visa-free travel for its citizens in the Schengen zone.  So far, the EU says that Turkey has not met the benchmarks for visa-free travel and needs to enact democratic reforms.  Since 2016, watchdog groups say the Turkish government has only grown more totalitarian.  Soylu's comments are part of a new escalation of tension between Turkey and the EU that began on July 15th.  An EU committee suspended high-level negotiations with Turkey over unauthorized drilling in the territorial waters of Cyprus.  The EU maintains that Turkish drilling is violating international law and the sovereignty of Cyprus.  Turkey is also accused of upgrading their military presence on Cyprus by smuggling dozens of German Leopard 2 tanks onto the island in early July.  This is a direct violation of their agreement with Germany, which had stipulated that the tanks could not be placed in Cyprus as a condition of their sale.  Negotiations for a comprehensive air transport agreement with Turkey were cancelled and all future negotiations have been put on hold.  A few days later, the Foreign Minister of Turkey retaliated.  He announced that Turkey would no longer take back migrants who illegally cross from Turkey into Greece until Turkey gets visa liberalization.  So the comments by the Interior Minister are just a continued escalation.  Currently, the Turkish Coast Guard says they are still preventing illegal crossings.  Yesterday, they apprehended around 50 people who tried to reach the Greek island of Samos on small boats.  There are already millions of Turks living in Europe.  The Turkish government is very much actively involved with this diaspora and uses them as a fifth column to pressure European governments.  Much of the Turkish diaspora is eligible to vote in Turkish elections, and the ruling AKP party actually campaigns in many European cities.  The obvious problem with visa liberalization is the fact that poor Turks would enter European nations, take advantage of the easily exploitable asylum laws, stay indefinitely, and live on welfare.  The Turkish interior minister is trying to blackmail the EU.  Either take in large numbers of our poor people, or we will send an even larger number of migrants from all over the world into Europe.  Meanwhile, there is already a backlash against the Schengen zone that has been building for years.  Even the globalist French president Emmanuel Macron has co-opted anti-Schengen rhetoric.  At the center of anti-Schengen sentiment is Greece, Many European politicians believe that Greece simply gives asylum visas to large numbers of unqualified illegal aliens because the Greek authorities know they will leave and go to wealthier EU nations anyway.  There is also a general backlash against any future integration of Turkey with Europe.  It was once the dream of the globalists to merge Turkey with Europe.  Now, even the hardcore globalist Manfred Weber pledged to deny Turkish ascension when he thought he was going to be the next EU Commission President.  The Schengen Zone has its advantages, but currently it allows benefits-seeking migrants and terrorists to freely cross borders.  If the EU did liberalize visa travel with Turkey, it might very well be the straw that breaks the Shagan camel's back.  All right, thanks for watching this video.
