            "text": "Attorney General Barr delivered a brief letter to Congress that included his summary of Special Counsel Mueller's investigation.  We have all seen the Attorney General's letter, but none of us, neither the Congress nor the public, has seen the report itself.  The Justice Department has declined even to say how many pages the report includes, as if that were some sort of state secret.  After all, let's not forget why we're here in the first place.  Two years ago, a hostile power attacked our democracy.  As Mr.  Barr's letter said, Russian actors, with the backing of Mr.  Putin, waged a sophisticated and malicious campaign of disinformation and falsehood in order to influence the outcome of our elections.  That's never happened before.  The American people deserve to see the documentation.  What did they do?  Who did they approach?  What happened?  Sweep an issue like this under the rug?  When the security of our wellspring elections, fair, uninterfered with by foreign power elections, is at stake?  So it's evident, it's self-evident, overwhelmingly, in the public interest for the Mueller report to be released to the people.  The American people simply want the truth.  Each American, if he chooses or she chooses, can read the report for themselves and draw their own conclusions.  Whether or not you're a supporter of President Trump or not, whatever you feel, there is no good reason not to make the report public.  On March 14th, just prior to the recess, the House of Representatives surprised a lot of our Republican friends here in the Senate.  They passed a resolution calling for the report to be made public.  Guess what the vote was?  420 to nothing.  Even the most vociferous defenders of President Trump, Mr.  Meadows, Mr.  Jordan, voted yes.  When the resolution arrived here in the Senate, I asked unanimous consent and that it would be adopted.  I thought it would be.  Regrettably, one senator objected.  The senator from South Carolina, my friend Senator Graham, said he wouldn't agree to the resolution unless it was amended to call for a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton.  And so the Senate was unable to pass a resolution that passed the House unanimously without controversy.  In fact, President Trump has said even before the report came out and repeatedly afterwards, several times, he supported passage of the House resolution.  He supports making it public.  So have a good number of my Republican colleagues, a whole bunch today.  So in a moment, I'm going to renew my request of March 14th that the Senate adopt House concurrent resolution calling for public release of the Mueller report.  Now that President Trump supports public release of the report, there's no good reason for anyone to object to this request.  It's a simple request for transparency, nothing more, nothing less, not to make a decision as to what you believe, not to say what we ought to do about it, just to make it public.  Transparency, a great American virtue that we've tried to uphold through the centuries.  So I hope I will not hear a request from the other side to amend the resolution to call for a different special counsel investigation.  If there's going to be objection, the American people deserve to know why.  Why should this report not be made public?  Not why something else shouldn't be done.  Not some extraneous issue.  Why shouldn't this report be made public?  And I'd ask my friend the leader, because I see him rising, I imagine he's going to object, to give a reason why this report should not be made public.  Not that something else should be done at the same time.  This is serious stuff.  If there's an objection raised, it will only serve to frustrate the compelling public interest that's made in the special counsel's report and making it public.  Therefore, Mr.  President, I'll now give the Senate another opportunity to join every one of their colleagues in calling for the public release of this important report.  And so, Madam President, as if in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of H. Conrres 24, expressing the sense of the Congress that the report of Special Counsel Mueller should be made available to the public and to Congress, and which is at the desk.  Further, that the concurrent resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.  Is there objection? ",

            "text": "Preserving the right to object.  As I said just a few moments ago, it's certainly good news for the country that the special counsel concluded that there is no evidence that the Trump campaign collaborated or conspired with the Russian government to influence the last presidential election.  It's also good news for the country that, due to the special counsel's work, we now have more insight into Russia's efforts to interfere with our democratic institutions.  Now, I've consistently supported the proposition that the special counsel should be allowed to finish his work without interference.  The work of the special counsel, however, is not yet complete.  Neither is the work of the Department of Justice.  The Attorney General told us yesterday that he's working with the Special Counsel to determine how much of the Special Counsel's report can be produced without violating the law and without jeopardizing other ongoing matters, including other matters initiated by the Special Counsel.  The Special Counsel and the Justice Department ought to be allowed to finish their work in a professional manner.  Now, my good friend, the Democratic leader, was all for allowing the special counsel to conduct his work without political interference when it might be politically advantageous to him.  But apparently, my friend from New York is not for allowing the special counsel to complete his work with the Justice Department according to his best professional and legal judgment when that might be inconvenient to my friend's own current political purposes.  To date, the Attorney General has followed through on his commitments to the Congress.  One of those commitments is that he intends to release as much information as possible.  I certainly welcome that commitment to transparency, as do others.  But to the extent that the Attorney General, in consulting with the special counsel, believes it is important to protect sensitive sources and methods, protect material that could affect ongoing investigations and prosecutions and is legally protected, then he deserves the time to work through these issues.  So I'm going to object in order to allow the special counsel and the Justice Department to finish their careful professional review of a no doubt voluminous record, a record that likely contains sensitive, classified, and legally protected material.  For all of those reasons, Mr.  President, I object. ",

It is hard to understand... why the majority leader wouldn't be for that resolution.  None of his objections, none, are in the words of the report.  In fact, the words of the report are very simple.  It should, a sense of the Congress, that it should be released.  Not when, not in violation of the law, not in a hurried matter, just be released.

This very extensive investigation took two years to be concluded.  So look, it's not unreasonable to give the special counsel and the Justice Department just a little time to complete their review in a professional and responsible manner.  Remember, as I said earlier, we're likely dealing here with potential other prosecutions, classified information, damaging people's reputations.  There's no evidence that the Attorney General is not going to produce as much information as possible for all of us.  And that's why I objected.  I think it's a reasonable thing to do.  We've been waiting for a long time for this report to wrap up.  It's largely good news, not just for the president, but for the country. ",
