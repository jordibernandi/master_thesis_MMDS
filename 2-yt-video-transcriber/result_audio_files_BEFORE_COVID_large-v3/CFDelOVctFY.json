            "text": "If these are all arrest warrants for Jason Pope, most allege the incidents usually happened at his home here on Lakeview Drive.  The documents show he had sex with and is even accused of kidnapping young girls.  The neighbor didn't want to go on camera, but says Pope lived next door to him for several years.  He says he's seen numerous young girls stop by.  Documents obtained by WMBF News show in July, Pope held young girls against their will in a room of his home to perform sex acts.  One of the victims, listed as 17 years old, said Pope gave her, quote, money and other things for sex.  Other reports detail incidents from September to December of 2017 where Pope extorted young girls for sex.  The neighbor says he saw several officers raiding Pope's home.  The oldest report dates back to 2011.  It shows Pope gave two victims, one listed as young as 13 years old, marijuana and money to have sex with him.  The report shows the victim told the officer a condom wasn't used and was concerned Pope had a sexually transmitted disease.  The investigation into Pope is ongoing.  If you have any information on these incidents or others, contact your local or state law enforcement department.  Live in Florence, Neal Watson, WMBF. ",

            "text": "Now, I know this story has been floating around for about a week or so.  About Jason Pope or the alleged DJ kid.  And I wasn't going to touch it.  because I thought it was self-explanatory.  It was actually so negative toward black women, I didn't think it was really my place to actually do a video on it, even though people have asked me.  And I wasn't going to do a video on it until two things happened.  One, I heard a video by Edward, Edward Anderson, talking about a live stream that he was on with Mr.  Fantastic.  And during the live stream, they were talking about Jason Pope and the 700 bodies that he had on his penis.  And they were all black women.  And during the discussion about Jason Pope and his campaign for young black women, A couple of black women in the chat were saying that it's the fault of thirsty black men.  If black men weren't thirsty, then these 700 black women would not have slept with Jason.  And I thought this was odd that they would even say that.  Like, how far do you have to go before black women actually act like adults and actually take responsibility for their own action?  without trying to blame it on somebody that didn't have anything to do with it.  Now, to recap the story, you just heard the beginning of Jason Pope actually being arrested on sex trafficking charges and trying to, you know, pimp out black girls.  Which is bad enough.  Throwing no shade at pimps.  They do what they do.  It's a normal, I wouldn't say normal, there's nothing about pimps and prostitutes normal.  I'm saying it's a, how can I say, it's a victimless crime.  The hoes choose the pimps and whatnot.  That's not what fascinates me.  What fascinates me is he made a Facebook post like six years ago saying he has 693 bodies that were all black.  And he said, what about you?  As you can see in the thumbnail.  And they come to find out that after his arrest, they found out that he's been going raw and up in these chicks.  And he's been carrying around, I think, what, HIV for the past 10 years or so, maybe more.  And the second piece that I heard that was sent to me by a sub of mine saying that a dude that lives in South Carolina A small town, basically.  A small little town in South Carolina.  Doctors in Chicago, according to my source, knew about this dude.  So, in other words, CDC had been following him for quite some time.  Well before this actually blew up.  And he had a nickname.  I'm not going to say what the initials were.  But evidently, this dude... The doctors in Chicago knew that this dude in South Carolina was actually infecting or potentially affecting, you know, all these black women with HIV.  And nobody said anything.  And from my sources, this is not the first time this has happened.  where a white man will get a social disease and then be allowed to go back out and spread it especially if it's amongst the black population especially among black women which is probably why black women's hiv rate is so much higher than black men are.  because every time we see these stats we're thinking that there's a firewall between black men and black women And the rest of the society turns out not so much.  So my source says there's some men that he's heard of that the doctors had heard of with the social disease that have bodies of like 200 black women.  These white guys.  So it got me to thinking.  If this is not unusual, and the fact is that white men are at the top of the food chain as far as the dating market, I am surprised that there's not more Jason Popes running around.  Probably there is more Jason Popes running around.  We just don't hear about him.  The fact that he lived in a small town in South Carolina made him easier to find.  In fact, from the report from his neighbors, there's a lot of women that knew about him.  There's a lot of people that knew about him.  And I'm not surprised, because as the beginning of the caption said, black woman would rather be a white man's concubine than a nigger's wife.  And what you saw with jason pope over these many years and many bodies that he's had with black women is that they're merely his concubine to have sex with and throw away.  and the fact that he had probably because by the time they caught him six years later after he made the post he probably had over seven maybe even 800 bodies 800 women that he slept with most of them without protection and you wonder why that is.  It's real simple.  If you fail to learn from the past, you will always repeat it.  If you fail to learn from the past, you will always repeat it.  And history tells us that 90% of slaves that were shipped here before 1780 were here to work.  And 90% of those people were men.  And the few women that were on the ship were actually sold off at a discount because they were not... valuable enough, and even Margo Jefferson says this, not valuable enough to be proper workers.  But after 1780, when Great Britain decided it was going to end the slave trade, they basically gave the colonies like a 20, 25 year head start to get themselves together before they start choking off the slave trade.  So after that, they reversed what they were doing.  They started shipping in way more black females than they had been, especially in the United States.  And then what they did?  instead of working them to death like they did the men, they decided to breed them.  And in some cases, a woman could win her freedom or buy her freedom if she bore the master of 12 children, which is probably why the slave fertility rate was so high, which actually did something to the white psyche.  because they realized how fertile the black woman was.  And under slavery, the slave woman's fertility rate was 10 babies per woman.  That was the average.  10 children per woman, which is like five times higher than it is right now.  But the point is, is that black women, when they were brought over here, especially in numbers, when I brought over to work, they're brought over here as concubine as a white man's concubine to have sex and bear him children or bear him more slaves.  he was always known as the man.  even uh francis chris wilson said that back in the 60s that the real man is the white man.  This was also said in Frazier's book, where I got the quote from.  Black female concubine whose white father, father of their children, would come and visit her cabin and bring her supplies and resources, would sit the white father down at the head of the table and have his children not call him father, but call him the man.  So if you think about it, historically, African women or black women were not brought over here to work, per se.  They were brought over here to be concubines and broodmares.  So it doesn't surprise me when I see a Jason Pope going through black women like water.  And probably could have gone through another six or 700 if they hadn't stopped it.  He could have easily gone through a lot more had he been in a more populous area, say like a New York or Chicago or Los Angeles.  He could have probably even doubled or tripled that number.  So when I first saw of a clip of Jason Pope with DJ Kidd.  When I first saw that little clip talking about he had 693 bodies at age 36, what about you?  I just merely passed it off as a white man actually having sex with his black concubine, as many as he could.  That is the dirty little secret that even black women don't want to tell is that this is not unusual.  And the only thing that holds all this back is because most white men have an aversion to black women.  Most, I didn't say all, most white men have an aversion to black women because if they didn't, if they didn't, You know, if they didn't have the social aversion of black women, then it'd be Katie bar the door.  White men know that if they open up and they pursue in numbers black women, that's going to open up the gate for their white woman to do the same thing on the other side, which is something they're not willing to do.  And I suspect it works almost the same way with black women.  i have a feeling they would love to pursue white daddy because every time they get a chance to they do.  jason pope did it in a very small town florence south carolina and he was still able to rack up video game numbers not only opposite sex but also the opposite color.  so for black women it was just to us.  i'm not going to speak for all because most black women have been curiously quiet on this jason pope thing.  but for the black women that were in the chat they tried to pawn this off on black men.  i only got one thing to say the nerve of you.  Black women are going to have to be really clear about their secret underlying desire to actually be the white man's concubine.  It's not their fault.  As careful tell me, it's not their fault.  This is being rolled into the culture.  This has been rolled into the culture.  That's how come black men have to overly prove themselves.  They're going to have to lay down their lives.  I have another video coming about that.  I'm not going to do it today, but I have a good juicy one coming that hopefully doesn't get me in too much trouble.  But at the end of the day, man, we're living with this legacy of slavery.  Why do we keep coming back to this?  Because the legacy of slavery and the dislocation and the damage that it did to black culture, the black subculture in the United States has never been fixed.  And if something's never been fixed in a particular engine or device, that's what it's going to keep doing.  Keep malfunctioning.  It's not going to fix itself.  So while I hate to see a white man being able to just literally go out and rack up these kind of numbers in a small town in South Carolina with black women that would normally, that people would normally poo-poo on so many black women sleeping with a black man.  But at the end of the day, it is what it is.  So brothers take heart.  This is black women revealing themselves even though they don't want to.  Because every time they'll say the black women have always been faithful, you look at Jason Pope's record.  But anyway, I think this one's gone on long enough.  I just wanted to weigh in on Jason Pope and his 700 black female concubine army.  It's hilarious.  And I'll see you guys on the next one.  Peace. ",
