            "text": "So, Taylor Swift, I'll sing you a little, you know, song about.  we need to calm down and it's not that serious, you know, with the whole take a chill pill type thing, you know, and how you did the little rap bar or whatever, you know what I'm saying?  Whatever you want to call it about.  If you're preaching at the parade, you're living in the dark ages and all that kind of stuff.  Look, I'm going to keep it 100 with you, all right?  First of all, the song, it was whack.  It just seemed like a desperate thing to push the agenda.  The beat was whack.  The flow was whack.  You're going to get a lot of support because the world, they love the message.  The reason why I say that is because the energy you just came at Christians with.  I'm going to come at you with the same energy.  Check this out.  Just because I don't accept the lifestyle doesn't mean that I hate anyone.  So how you tried to portray Christians in the video was wrong.  All right.  I can agree to disagree.  I've worked with homosexuals in the military.  They knew where I stood on it, but I respected them.  You know what I'm saying?  I didn't bash them.  I didn't hate them.  You know what I'm saying?  They just knew I don't agree with that lifestyle.  It's the same way when a mother or father, they have a child who grows up and they make certain choices they don't agree with.  That doesn't mean that I don't love you.  You're still my child.  You know what I'm saying?  I still respect you and come along, but we just don't agree in that area.  So when you try to make it sound like, well, you know, Christians don't bow down because that's what it sounds like to me.  And you don't accept us for who we are and all this kind of stuff that we're just so full of hate.  Number one, that's not even the real problem that a lot of Christians have.  The problem is stop trying to push the agenda on my kids.  Stop trying to make it mandatory to teach it in the classes and have drag queens come in the classes and put it in all the cartoons and the little kid movies and force it down the throats of everybody.  What you do in your bedroom, do it in the bedroom.  Stop trying to make it where you're suing Christian businesses and make me put something on a cake or a t-shirt that goes against my religious beliefs and tell me that if I don't bow down, even though you have many other places to go to, even though you don't see nobody, no gays going to a mosque or going to the Muslim, you know, or is the businesses that are run by Muslims, right?  You don't see them doing that, trying to sue them, right?  It's just Christians.  It's politically correct to attack Christians.  I mean, I wonder, would you make a video with that same energy you just had, but about people who follow Islam.  It's OK for you to do it with like Christians and the vaccine, the little signs.  Oh, you know, you try to make it with.  God didn't make Steve for Adam.  He made Eve.  You really you really went there and you try to paint Christians a certain way.  Now, the individuals who are like that, check this out.  They're not really Christians.  If you actually knew what the Bible says, there's a lot of people who claim to be Christians who are not Christians.  But the reality is all sin is sin.  Fornication, lying, being proud, being evil, being a murderer, being a thief, whatever it is, whether you like it or not, the word of God doesn't change.  And that's not... I have every right to believe that here in the United States of America.  You could call it the dark ages and you want to be progressive and you want to change it.  But the word of God does not change.  So we will not bow down.  We will not apologize.  But I do acknowledge that we should believe what we believe in love.  And we have every right to do so here in this country.  It's just funny to me how you have that energy to dis Christians.  But you didn't have no Muslims in the video killing people for being gay and stuff.  Matter of fact, when you really think about it, Christians are like the number one persecuted group in the whole world.  I'm just saying.  And if you really want to be real, a lot of Christians are getting persecuted right now.  I mean, how many times do you really hear about a real Christian?  If you understand the Bible, like killing anybody.  We follow the teachings of Jesus.  People be like, oh, this white man went and shot up a school or went up and shot a club.  That guy wasn't a Christian.  But you believe that because you don't know what the Bible says.  Just because somebody says out their mouth they're a Christian doesn't mean they're a Christian.  So Taylor Swift, I'm going to be 100 with you.  Your video, whack.  Your message, not truth and whack.  And I'm just telling you like.  And if you got an issue, you know, please reach out to me.  You know what I'm saying?  Like if this video ever crosses your path, I could talk to you and keep it 100 with you and walk away with just all love and respect.  But we don't appreciate that.  We don't appreciate being told that if we don't bow down to certain things and certain viewpoints that we're full of hate.  What if somebody told you, you know, if you don't bow down and accept, you know, the black Hebrew Israelites or any other group that is out there that thinks they're right in their own eyes.  Or if you don't bow down to our views and accept this, then you're full of hate.  No, you just disagree.  I don't agree with that lifestyle.  Still love you.  Still respect you.  Matter of fact, because I love you, I'm going to give you the truth.  Because I love you, I'm going to tell you what I really believe in my heart.  There really is a heaven.  There really is a hell.  I mean, come on.  How can anybody not believe in God if you want to be real?  The way that this earth is run, you know what I'm saying?  The perfect distance from the sun.  We don't melt up.  We don't freeze.  We've got water.  We've got oxygen.  The two things that we need to survive, the way that the reproductive system is, the way a woman has a period, the way that the body self heals.  You mean evolution happened and we're just here living just to die?  The cycle of life and death, children being born?  There's no God?  Okay.  That sounds crazy.  There's a God, trust me, and we all go stand before him.  And that's why I give you the message according to the word of God from the only one true God, which is found through Jesus Christ.  Just saying, if anybody has an issue with this, like I said, it's not hate.  It's all love.  I'm just standing for the truth.  And if you don't like my truth and you don't agree with the truth, it doesn't mean that I hate you.  And I'm not even trying to push it on you.  He who has an ear, let him hear.  I put it out there.  You receive it, you reject it.  It's up to you.  But I say this to all my believers, my brothers and sisters out there.  Stuff like this with the Taylor Swift video, I'm telling y'all it's coming.  Slowly but surely, man, that door was open.  And every year, more momentum, more people being politically correct about it, more movies, more territory.  Better wake up, better pay attention. ",
