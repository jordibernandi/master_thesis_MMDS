            "text": "Are you serious?  Are you serious?  Okay, guys, sitting out here, you may hear the birds chirping.  We've got some breaking news.  Now, Stephen Ben-Nun came out with this last night that the United States was doing airstrikes against Iranian forces in Syria.  Well, we do have some information now.  And now we know why.  Remember what Mike Pompeo said on Monday?  That nobody, and I repeat, nobody is going to be buying oil from the Iranians anymore.  The one-year grace period is over.  Seven nations were given a waiver.  Now it's over.  Well, breaking news just now happening.  U.S.  airstrikes have targeted 32 different oil tankers.  which tried to enter government-held areas, according to Al Arabia Correspondence reporting, citing that the Syrian Democratic Forces.  So what happened was there were 32 oil tankers trying to get oil out of Syria on behalf of the Iranians.  And those oil tankers have all been blown to smithereens.  So President Trump has said no more.  No one's going to buy any more oil from the Iranians.  And that's what's taking place.  And so, again... Let's take our hats off to Steven Benenoun because he was the first to identify that there was some type of United States airstrikes taking place against Iranian forces or Iranian locations.  Now we know what it was.  It was United States is not going to let Iran get oil.  Sell it to other countries now.  This is really important because what if there's a Iranian oil tanker headed in the ocean right now For let's say Russia?  Are the United States gonna stop that also?  Or is this the beginning of it?  we're gonna start cutting it off at the source.  So we're gonna keep a close eye on all of this.  guys wars rumors of wars and it's it's getting crazy.  I'll be back with more current world events and how they relate to biblical prophecy.  Oh yeah, we're in the last days.  Are you serious?  Are you saved? ",
