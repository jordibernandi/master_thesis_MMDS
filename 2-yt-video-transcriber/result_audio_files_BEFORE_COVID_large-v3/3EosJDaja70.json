            "text": "My body, my choice!  My body, my choice!  It's literally like hell in there.  Literally like hell.  Well, thank you.  Are they taking it?  No, so far so good.  Yeah, we had someone throw it on the ground, but it's like a parker.  You have no right to be here.  Shut the f*** up.  Stop it.  It's called the right to free speech.  It's called the right to be... Do not even get me f***ing started.  Why do you have a right in what I do with my body?  It's not your body.  It is my f***ing body.  My body, my choice.  No, but the child inside you isn't.  When does it become a child for you?  It's my body.  I would have to carry the child.  Why?  You don't have to f***ing carry the child.  Yeah, but when does it become a child for you?  When?  It's still a baby inside, but I have every single right to decide what I do with my own body.  It is a baby, then.  It is a baby inside you, then.  No, it's not.  It's a fetus.  But you just said it was.  It's a fetus!  But you just said it was a fetus.  It's a fetus!  Well, what's a fetus?  none of you men you all are ever should ever tell a woman.  can we just have a polite conversation.  no we can't my body.  why should you as a man be telling any woman because you're backing her with religion?  i am the one who would carry the child because i would defend your life just as much as i would defend the baby's life.  You have the equal right to life.  No.  Yes.  You're literally making no sense.  You have no right to tell a woman what she has to do with her body.  No right.  My body, my time.  Why are you standing in front of my sign?  My body, my time.  Stand up for your life.  You can't do this.  This is like a college scene.  First of all, when did you say we were speaking for all women?  Second of all, it doesn't matter.  You can't speak about a woman's body.  You're not a woman.  You don't know.  We're talking about the child, though.  We're not talking about the woman's body.  Okay, but the child is coming out of the woman's body.  Sure.  And that child shouldn't be murdered, right?  Yeah, it's not being murdered.  I don't know.  It is better to let a thousand abortions occur, to let however many abortions occur that need to happen in favor of helping the already alive small children that are going to die because of a lack of vaccines, a lack of health care, a lack of shelter.  I say that is where your efforts would be better concentrated.  Without argument, we could kill a thousand people that are already born if it will make your life and my life more comfortable.  You said if we kill a thousand babies that are about to be born, what in the world?  Would you support abortion if the woman was raped?  Absolutely not.  Why?  Because a child shouldn't have to suffer because of the sins of the father, even if it be for rape.  A fetus is not a person.  Yes, it is.  That's where the disagreement is.  The fetus, what is it going to become?  Is it going to become human?  It's going to become a person.  Because it's already developing.  So you're still growing.  We're all developing.  You're going to become old and you're going to die.  Actually, it's my first time finding out about the group.  So I am very intrigued because I personally come from a Catholic background.  So to me, this is very important.  They will definitely sign this form.  Y'all aren't fooling anyone, especially on this campus.  Y'all are just anti-women.  It's not that hard.  Y'all don't care about the babies.  You in specific.  I don't understand why you're letting all these men dictate what's going on with the legislature.  Good.  Because y'all are disgusting.  I'd like to talk beyond the Planned Parenthood talking points.  Okay, Planned Parenthood talking points.  One of the Planned Parenthood talking points is you're anti-women.  But you guys are into it.  It's not a topic point, it's a reality.  But abortion kills men and women, right?  But it's ultimately the woman's choice.  What does abortion do?  Abortion?  Okay.  Y'all are just a brick wall.  What does abortion do?  Y'all are disgusting.  Can anybody tell me when you became a human?  You can't tell me when you became a human.  Yeah, I can.  Like, when I was born, jackass.  When you were born?  So what were you before?  I'm confused about the bagpipes.  Where did they have to do anything?  It was a sell.  And you know what?  It made my mom's easier to afford me.  She could live like that.  It's her choice to live the way she wants to.  Abortions wouldn't be happening if women could keep themselves from getting pregnant when they didn't want to.  I'll tell you what it is.  It's chastity.  Yo, bagpipes!  Chastity.  Shut up!  It's purity.  Okay, that was a little bit excessive.  You're a fascist.  I have no time for you.  That, the spitting, I do not condone that.  Do you see that?  You need to get out of here.  Why?  Seriously.  Because nobody likes you here.  In the meantime, here's a condom.  Oh, wait.  That's right.  You don't need to.  I'm telling you.  Don't touch him.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  Don't touch him.  Don't touch him.  So I was having a debate.  They were bringing up the most stupid arguments.  And they asked, what happened to my hand?  And I said, I sprained my wrist.  And all of them, one of them just hit it, and they ran away as soon as they did that.  You're going to keep fighting, though, right?  Yes, sir.  And I'm like, you.  It wasn't enough.  I'm like, you.  You're not crossing this line.  I'm not letting you cross this line because this is our campus.  Yeah!  Man!  Hey!  You want us to call the cops?  Go ahead and call the cops.  I'm right here.  Boom.  Get out of here.  No one wants to hear what you have to say, man.  No one here wants to hear what you have to say.  I'm going to stand here and do the move, man.  Move, man.  No one wants to hear.  i didn't see them.  they threw some soda or something and just ran in that direction.  okay I went to talk to the campus police and they said they're calling the city police because they don't know what they can do with the number of people they have.  It looks like now they intervened.  The bagpipes have not stopped playing.  They tried to kick his bagpipes?  Hit him.  Hit.  Like, they swung at his bagpipes.  Can I see your rosary?  Yeah, sure.  It's a nice rosary.  You came prepared.  You know, you're brave coming out here today.  I don't care.  You know what?  These people, they're not afraid, so we shouldn't be afraid either.  I agree.  I agree.  Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee.  Blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.  Holy Mary, Mother of God, My choice!  My body!  My choice!  Tradition!  Family!  Poverty!  America!  America!  America!  My body!  My choice!  My body!  My choice!  You!  You, start.  The pro-lifers have got to go, hey, hey!  Ho, ho!  The pro-lifers have got to go, hey, hey!  Ho, ho!  The pro-lifers have got to go, hey, hey!  You ready to go?  Yeah.  Okay, let's go.  Thank y'all so much for watching.  Never give up fighting for life.  God bless. ",
