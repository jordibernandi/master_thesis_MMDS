            "text": "Do you have a hunch?  I've got a hunch.  it's going extremely well.  I've got a hunch that all the experts elsewhere may just have got it wrong.  And there we are.  That is... An absolutely extraordinary result.  This is terrible, isn't it?  And it's a total rejection of your politics, of your style of politics in the Labour Party and everything that you've done with the Corbyn project.  Well, it would seem that way.  What's supposed to be a catastrophic result for the country and for everything that the Labour Party exists to fight for, the people it was founded to champion, to represent.  And I'm so sorry to people watching this who are full of dismay and horror and who are scared.  Disbelief at first.  Jeremy Corbyn.  We won the argument.  Sure, Jan.  You had the worst result for Labour in 85 years.  Yeah, you really won the argument.  Greatest defeat for Labour since 1935.  Jeremy Corbyn.  We won.  Jeremy Corbyn.  We won.  Bruh.  We won the argument, but I regret we didn't convert that into balls into the goal.  The operation was a complete success.  I'm delighted with the results.  The patient, however... is dead.  I nearly ran the country, you know.  Of course you did, let's get you ready for bed.  You wanna know why Labour lost?  Because the left has abandoned the core principle of what they once represented, the interests of the working class.  They won a single seat in a wealthy area of London and lost dozens in the poorest parts of the UK, the areas devastated by mass immigration and deindustrialisation.  When the new face of Labour sounds like this.  And to see working class people caring about Boris Johnson.  They're shooting themselves in the face.  It's disgusting.  Working class people.  That's disgusting.  Posh, plummy, condescending, jumped up, self-entitled, latte-sipping London bubble brats.  Is it any wonder you stopped resonating with the working class?  You can't be the party of old mining towns and the party of Extinction Rebellion.  It's disgusting.  And I wish him the worst.  I wish him a horrible death.  I plan to work in the NHS.  I plan to be a doctor.  So let me get this straight.  You're planning to work as a doctor and you're wishing a, quote, horrible death on someone for their political views.  I wish him a horrible death.  I plan to be a doctor.  Yeah.  Those two things don't really seem to fit.  If I'm ever in hospital and I see you coming down the corridor, I don't care how ill I am, I'm gonna be out of there quicker than if Harold Shipman had just turned up.  Disgusting!  It's a myth that Labour lost the working class, published two days before the election, after which Labour lost dozens of working class seats.  Should have come on my show, Ash.  Then you might have reached some actual working class people outside of student activist LARPers.  Ash Sarkar, day one of a Labour government.  Well, I don't know about you, but I'm absolutely flabbergasted that this didn't resonate with working class people in northern areas like Don Valley, Blythe and Bolsover.  Truly shocked.  I'm literally a communist.  Literally a communist, walks like a supermodel, fucks like someone who just helped gift the Tories a landslide victory.  I mean, what a shocker that this didn't resonate.  What a shocker that Stormzy calling Boris Johnson a fucking prick didn't resonate with anyone apart from 14 year olds who can't even vote.  What a shocker that shilling for an identity politics police state which arrests mothers in their own homes for misgendering someone online.  Hi, I'm Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the Labour Party.  My pronouns are he, him.  Alan Partridge is ill-informed and ignorant, and therefore he's a conservative and a Brexiteer, so there you go.  So he'd be voting Boris Johnson?  Yes, because he's... I think the reason the Tories don't invest as much money in education is because they depend on a certain level of ignorance for their support.  Multimillionaire.  Hollywood lovey Steve Coogan.  calling Brexit supporters ill-informed, ignorant and uneducated didn't make them want to vote for Labour.  Imagine my shock.  What a surprise that insulting millions of potential voters proved to be an unsuccessful election strategy.  Hollywood lovey Hugh Grant, net worth 60 million.  His relentless Ramona attack on the sanctity of democracy didn't resonate with the British people.  Imagine my shock.  All the candidates he campaigned for during the election lost.  There goes the neighbourhood.  No, there goes your credibility.  The British people listened to your democracy-wrecking garbage and told you to fuck off.  What a surprise that some hyper-privileged rich bellend telling 17 million people that their vote shouldn't count didn't win hearts and minds.  What a shocker that the left affiliating with smug, patronising, self-righteous, sanctimonious, out-of-touch celebrities didn't work.  I mean, who could have predicted it?  You want to know why you lost?  Because you think that calling people racists on Twitter to score virtue-signalling brownie points from other woke idiots translates into votes.  Newsflash, it doesn't.  You think using mob intimidation to shame people into adopting your worldview is a winning ballot box strategy.  Newsflash, it isn't.  How many defeats do you have to suffer before you begin to realise that?  Judging from your reaction, you still haven't learned.  Calling anyone who voted Leave, or was thinking of voting Tory, thick as shit.  How could we possibly have lost?  Once again, the strategy of calling anyone who was thinking of voting differently to me self-serving, inward-looking, stupid, racist, leave-voting scum paid absolute dividends, didn't it?  Not my prime minister!  Not my prime minister!  Fascist bastard!  Not my prime minister!  Not my prime minister!  Not my prime minister!  Not my prime minister!  Not my prime minister!  Fascist!  Fascist!  Fascist!  Racist!  Sexist!  Flashes!  Sexist races!  You are here.  BBC exit poll predicts Tories to take 70 plus seats.  If so, a victory of the old over the young.  Racists over people of colour.  Selfishness over the planet.  Special congratulations to older voters who went Tory.  Fucking over the younger generations for decades and guaranteeing them a Brexit they hate because you liked the man with the funny hair who isn't afraid to say those racist things you enjoy.  Let me be gracious.  All the people celebrating now are the most entitled, embittered, sneering, nasty, selfish, racist, foul fuckwits.  I'd still rather be with the decent people, however gutted they are, than be with you for a second.  Some say it was Brexit, some say it was Jeremy.  Personally, and I know no one wants to hear it, I think that racism and misogyny run so deep in this country that Boris won because of this attitude towards those things and not in spite of them.  What's the problem?  It's very in your face, not xenophobia, racism.  The words and memes and themes and tropes of the far right are surprisingly present in working class discourse in these places.  Maybe you didn't call enough people bigoted gammon on Twitter.  Maybe that was it.  Maybe you didn't devote enough hours to abusing random strangers on the internet.  Maybe that's why you lost.  Or maybe, just maybe, ostracising and publicly humiliating huge chunks of the general public makes them hate you.  Just maybe.  For this election campaign, we did not descend into the gutter.  We did not.  What a shocker that mocking millions of people as thick, deplorable, racist morons didn't work.  I mean, who could have predicted it?  You could put Half of Trump supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables.  The racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic.  Brits went to the polls and told the hard left, institutionally anti-Semitic, Brexit blocking, identity politics obsessed, climate change hysterics of the Labor Party, led by terror sympathizing socialist simpleton Jeremy Corbyn, to get stuffed.  We're constantly told that the right wants to destroy inclusivity and create division.  Yet every time the left is defeated, there's only one side that refuses to accept democracy.  There's only one side that spills out into the streets and has public hissy fits in response to losing a fair vote.  There's only one side that seeks to continue to create division.  So-called anti-fascists in black masks violently refusing to accept the result of a democratic election.  Sounds very... I don't know, what's the word?  Oh yeah, fascist.  Speaking of which... Because the Conservative Party have a aim to break up our country, they aim to destroy our NHS, and we will say no!  We will fight them in the Parliament, we will fight them in the courts, we will fight them in the workplaces, and we will fight them in the streets!  They will not... For me, the most prominent media faces representing the Labour Party in this election were Ash Sarkar, Paul Mason, Aaron Bastani and Owen Jones.  If anyone in the Labour Party actually wants to win next time, probably a good idea to de-platform these people.  Personally, going forward, I want to see as much of them as possible.  So what have we learned from this election?  Calling people who disagree with you Nazis and racists doesn't work.  It doesn't resonate with ordinary people, it doesn't change minds, and it doesn't win elections.  But you just can't stop, can you?  Please, by all means, carry on.
