            "text": "black ram 313 back at it again.  you know why.  it's because this is therapeutic man.  back again with another video hence another therapy session.  today's topic and title is Ayesha never satisfied.  Curry, why Ayesha wants more attention.  Well, by now you already know that this topic is what everyone in the manosphere is talking about.  I've never seen a topic covered by so many content creators at one time.  And you know that Black Brown 313 has to add his two cents as well.  The story, Aisha Curry married to basketball player Steph Curry, six time NBA All-Star, having won two MVPs and three basketball championships.  Now, Steph is what every lady wants.  He's what every lady has on her checklist.  He's rich.  Check.  He's tall being at six foot three.  Check.  He has green eyes or grayish or bluish.  And we know the succubi likes exotic eyes.  Right.  Check.  He has high social status, check.  And as far as we know, he's monogamous, check.  Isn't he the dream of the succubus?  Now, Steph has chosen with all that he has, To give such to Aisha.  She, in the eyes of most women, has the perfect man, the perfect family, a storybook life that can only be witnessed in most times or most cases in Hollywood.  A fairy tale, if you will.  Every girl wants what Aisha has, but she still is not satisfied.  Now, reportedly she married him as a virgin.  They've been together since they were teens.  So he may be the only man that she knows intimately, but still.  That's not enough.  Even without a frame of reference, if you know what I mean.  Aisha, what more can you ask for than the life that you have now?  You have a TV show, a cooking show.  You're very popular.  You're rich.  What more can you ask for?  But wait, what have I been saying for years?  What is a woman's favorite word?  That's right.  More.  I hope you didn't forget that Black Ram original saying.  Remember also the video that I done a while back called Never Satisfied.  She is exemplary in the fact that she makes the case that I've been making for years.  And that case is that one guy simply is not enough to satisfy the insatiable appetite of the succubi.  Now, Aisha stated that she wanted more attention from men, saying, and I'm paraphrasing, that her lack of attention from men is causing her to be a little insecure.  She went on to state that her husband gets a lot of attention and that she gets zero attention and wants attention.  Poor Aisha.  But Aisha, the question is this, why and to what end?  Why do you want this attention?  And what is the point of that?  Well, I can answer that myself.  The reason why she wants attention is is to satisfy, at least temporarily, that inner thought that the succubi carries in its DNA.  She wants men to see her, desire her.  Her husband's attention is not enough.  She's jealous of her husband's desirability in the eyes of others.  But at the same time, we know that the fee fail does not want any man.  that other fee fails don't want and desire.  Confusion, right?  Yes, she is a representative of Babylon, the land of confusion.  So with receiving attention from other guys, wouldn't this lead maybe Aisha to a conversation, maybe an in-person meetup, then possibly maybe a little creeping.  Is that what you're looking for?  So let me get this straight.  This married woman wants men to look at her.  She wants attention from other men.  But she's married.  Now, this is wrong if you believe the book, specifically Matthew chapter five, verse 28, for those who believe in the book.  But this is a succubi's mentality, wanting and causing men to error.  She is a married woman seeking attention from other men.  Now, I'm willing to bet that she may be leaving Steph in a few years.  She's getting bored of being the wife and the mother.  Soon she may desire to be single.  I did a video back in the day called the stages and ages of her perpetual undevelopment.  In that video, I detail that the typical fee fail goes from being single to wanting to be a wife and wanting to be a mother and then diverts back into her second adulthood, which is thoughthood in her late 30s and 40s.  The typical succubi wants to relive her earlier days.  And as I said in my first video that women want chaos, which is which was stated before anyone else ever used the term, I said that she wants chaos.  I said that she's never satisfied.  And I also said that she will always leave you.  This is the nature of the creature.  So, yes, Aisha just might want to eventually get out there and ride the carousel.  She has nothing to lose.  In fact.  If or when she decides to leave, she will be rewarded by this gynocentric system.  She'll be rewarded with Steph's money and his children.  As we well know, this society gives incentives for a woman to leave.  So why wouldn't she?  She would probably call her marriage at some point oppressive and write a book.  Although this is far from true.  And this marriage was her dream from the beginning.  But ah, yes, the reality of female nature.  Never satisfied and always playing the victim role.  Now in closing, let me make this last point.  Aisha, after going as far as hypergamy can take her by marrying up to Steph Curry.  Now once the bag is secured after the divorce, she will begin, I make this prediction, to date down And ride the carousel.  She wants to experience what that life is about because reportedly she's never experienced such.  But remember, this is Babylon.  Although physically she hasn't been with another mentally, she has.  This is what Babylon brings such wickedness and confusion.  Now, I can imagine that her husband is embarrassed by this situation and he ultimately will be another victim of the gynocracy.  Now, with all of the divorces in Hollywood, in sports, with all these rich men being taken for their money.  These blue pillars will never, ever learn because they worship the feminine.  So they will continue to get married and continue to be taken to the cleanest to have their resources taken from them, which is OK by them because their resources are a means to an end to worship the feminine.  They would never learn that no man can ever satisfy the succubi.  And you can never make her happy, not even for a moment, because she will always want what?  More, more money, more gifts, more attention, more fame, more popularity.  more cosmetic surgery, more carousel riding, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more.  The wise among us will not even attempt such an exercise in futility as to try to satisfy the succubi.  Like the video?  Subscribe to the channel.
