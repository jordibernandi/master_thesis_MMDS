Yeah, but we don't want people to feel that way.  Don't you think that... I don't know.  I mean, like, I'm just trying to... You can... Yeah, I agree that it's not nice.  On that particular thing, do you think it would be good, or do you want society to feel like if a man can't have a child, he should view himself as less of a man?  It's not that I want this, it's the problem that you will always run up to.  Hey Boon, stand still.  Wings of shit?  I'd like to have wings.  Oh!  You'll come to my video essays and be like, man, this guy's got some, uh, cool, uh, he's got some really smart things to say, I think.  And now look at you.  Watch me eat a raw garlic.  Mmm.

Get out of here!  Hans!  Oh!  Bourgeoisie!  Hans!  Get out of here!  I'm a communist!  Guys, do you think I could manage- I could hit this guy from- from this- this- OH FUCK!  Choreosix?  Oh, uh, Choreosix?  Uh... I mean... They've helped us out, but they did randomly decapitate someone.  So... I guess I was just supposed to wait.  Oh, well... What's happening?  I know.

Is she over in that direction, chat?  Let's watch our movie.  Here we go.  Oh!  Uh-oh.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Chat, please explain.  I'm tired of the marketing, I'm tired of the, uh, women respect, uh, you know.  Can someone quote, I'm tired of the women respect?  Two shits to give what they have to say.  He will go on.  He knows it was an interview, right?  Like, generally speaking, when you ask a question at an interview... You want an answer?  The sensible position is always in the middle.  It's about time.  Oh, yeah.  Thanks for being sensi- Thanks for being ra- You know what, Brit?  You're not like other girls.  I'm pretty rational.  It's as simple as that.  My wife, folks, she's not like other girls.
