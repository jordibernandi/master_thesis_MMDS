And she called Onision up there in regards to Chris Hansen's case.  But for whatever reason, he couldn't follow along with that and thought the judge was saying that I was not served, which I was.  It just took law enforcement quite a while to find where I lived because I've moved so many times.  And can I just correct you?  Onision, Greg, and anyone else.  It's not Solzbach.  I don't know why people mispronounce my last name all the time, but I've said my name a lot in videos.  It's Daniel Solzbach, as in like John Sebastian Bach, like the composer, the musician, Bach.  Not back, not buck, not burger.  Daniel Solzbach.  It's so simple, yet everyone seems to pronounce it wrong, even when I correct them. ",

            "text": "Apparently to Greg, a police officer gave him advice to file a protection order against me and Chris Hansen.  And here's the thing, I can kind of understand.  if you have people showing up at your house, even though he's a journalist, I can understand that.  But I still don't understand the filing on me specifically.  That one I just can't grasp.  Because again, I've never been to your house.  I've never followed your car.  I've never been around you.  I've been covering you for eight years.  And over eight years, my first actual presence of being around you is in a courtroom for something that you dismissed yourself, which is laughable at this point.  But I'm just shocked that if someone just gives you advice and that's just what you do... You don't actually seek out legal... So you sought out, what, a police officer's personal opinion?  It really makes me wonder what exactly Greg said to the police officer in regards to me.  Because clearly I had to have been mentioned at some point because that's what the police officer recommended.  So I wonder if he's, like, saying to the police officer, like, there's this guy on YouTube called Repzion who's been stalking me and cyberstalking me and makes mean videos about me or something.  Like, I don't know.  But he did admit here that he reached out to an attorney and he wants to seek other legal avenues or other means, which to me says, a.k.a.  he is going to attempt to try to take me to civil court for something else.  That hasn't happened yet, but when it does, if it does, I will definitely let people know.  I really hope for his sake he doesn't go down that route, because it's just gonna be... The thing is, is this dismissal of himself, of the two protection orders, this actually works against him if he has a future case.  I don't know if people know that, but if you file, like, a legal paperwork protection order against somebody, and then you dismiss it and have it, you know... get rid of it, you still essentially wasted the court's time and money and resources to go through this process.  And that can be used in a future case.  If you want to bring a case against me in the future, I'm going to use, like, I can use this against you.  I don't want to.  I don't want to keep doing this dumb stuff.  There's a point where you have to draw down a line down in the sand and ask yourself, like, am I going too far with this?  And the answer is yes, obviously.  You don't know what you're doing. ",

I didn't even put my right hand up and swear an oath or anything.  It was literally under like seven minutes in total.  And I sat back down and just watched him stand up there and like dismiss himself and the two things that he filed.  And I'm thinking to myself, is this really happening right now?  Did... You just waste legal resources for the lols, for the trolls.  You're really going to seek other legal means to come at me for somebody who, again, covers things publicly that you say and do?  At the end of the day, I'm eternally grateful for the amount of support that you guys have shown me.  And I'm absolutely shocked and humbled that the $2,500 that I had for legal fees was covered 10 times that amount.  And I want to thank each and every one of you, no matter the amount.  the messages and the things that I've, all of what I've been receiving the last two days since I opened my GoFundMe has been incomprehensibly overwhelming to the point that I don't even know how to properly respond other than repeat the same jargon of thank you, thank you, thank you.  And it's, to me, this happened two days ago.  It's surreal to me that this even happened.  I don't know of like, other than H3H3 and like one other YouTuber, I don't know of any other YouTubers that have had legal issues like this over something so frivolous And time wasting.  And if anything, this has actually backfired on you, Greg.  I see this as something like, what you did here backfired on you, not only in terms of the social media outlet of support that I have gained from this, and that's not a brag, I'm not flexing here, I'm not bragging.  Like, it's a genuine, like, I've blown away at the reverse, like, I don't know if you're trying to pull some psychological, like, play in my head and, like, freak me out or something like that, but it did not... work well in your favor here.  And to avoid any more controversy for yourself, what I would recommend is that you get child safety locks for your windows.  Maybe don't pull out a camera and record things that you probably shouldn't.  The number one priority as a father should be the safety of your own kiddos.  That's all I'm gonna say in regards to what everybody's been demanding me talk about, which I don't really wanna talk about, and that's as much as you're gonna get out of me.  Child safety locks exist.  get them, and don't leave a two-year-old child unattended.  That's all I got to say.  I will see you guys in a few days for a new video on an individual who has been brought to my attention who I do not like, and everybody seems to not like, but somehow he's affecting so many impressionable kids into thinking that this type of behavior is normal to post on YouTube.  So you'll see that in a few days.  Thanks for watching this video, and have a great rest of your day. ",
