            "text": "New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.  I don't think I'm that bad.  You're likable enough.  Thank you so much.  It's three agencies of government when I get there that are gone.  Commerce, education, and the, what's the third one there?  You can't name the third one?  The third agency of government, I would do away with the education, the commerce, and let's see.  I can't.  Texas Senator Ted Cruz.  In 1999, you voted for the very bill that made banks bigger.  I was appointed to the office.  It was my very first vote.  Are you saying you didn't know what you were voting for?  I just arrived at the Senate.  In President Obama's own words that he looked to Massachusetts as a blueprint or a guide when he designed Obamacare.  Fair enough, but you chose those words.  If it was Obamacare on Fox News Sunday, why is it not Obamacare standing here with the governor right there?  I just want to add, I did not say that it should be done, but I certainly recognize why Governor Spitzer is trying to do it.  And we have failed.  We have failed.  No, no, no.  You said yes.  You thought it made sense to do it.  No, I didn't, Chris.  Businessman Donald Trump.  You've all made a few people upset over your political careers.  Which enemy are you most proud of?  I'd have to say the enemy soldier that threw the grenade that wounded me.  But he's not around right now to talk to.  Florida Senator Marco Rubio.  I'll tell you what.  10,000 bucks?  $10,000 bet?  Well, I have to tell you, I hear phenomenal things.  I hear your wife is a lovely woman.  She is.  She's fantastic.  I don't know her, and this is a total mischaracterization of what I say.  She is absolutely the love of my life, and she's right here, and why don't you apologize for her right now?  No, I won't do that because I said nothing wrong, but I do.  But I would add this.  Let's dispel with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn't know what he's doing.  He knows exactly what he's doing.  He is trying to change this country.  He wants America to become more like the rest of the world.  You see, everybody, I want the people at home to think about this.  That's what Washington, D.C.  does.  The drive-by shot at the beginning with incorrect and incomplete information, and then the memorized 25-second speech.  that is exactly what his advisors gave him.  Former Florida governor Jeb Bush.  Did you see a UFO?  I did, and the rest of the account... It was an unidentified flying object, okay?  And Dr.  Ben Carson, please come out on the stage.  He's standing there as well.  Dr.  Carson.
