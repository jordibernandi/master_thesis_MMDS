            "text": "I thank you both for your testimony today.  I would highlight a couple things about what we've heard this afternoon.  First, Ambassador Volker, your written testimony in which you say, in hindsight, I now understand that others saw the idea of investigating possible corruption involving the Ukrainian company Burisma as equivalent to investigating former Vice President Biden.  I saw them as very different, the former being appropriate and unremarkable, the latter being unacceptable.  In retrospect, you said, I should have seen that connection differently, and had I done so, I would have raised my own objections.  Ambassador, we appreciate your willingness to amend your earlier testimony in light of what you now know.  And I think you've made it very clear that knowing what you do today that in fact the President sought an investigation of his political rival, Vice President Biden, that you would not have countenanced any effort to encourage the Ukrainians to engage in such conduct.  I appreciate also that you were able to debunk, I hope for the last time, the idea that Joe Biden did something wrong when he, in accordance with U.S.  policy, sought to replace a corrupt prosecutor, something that not only the US State Department wanted, not only the European Union wanted, and not only the IMF wanted, but was the consensus position of the United States national security infrastructure.  You didn't get a lot of questions about that today, as other witnesses did, because I think you effectively said that was all nonsense.  We appreciate your candor about that.  Mr.  Morrison, I think what is most remarkable about your testimony is the acknowledgement that immediately after the Vice President met with President Zelensky in Warsaw, you witnessed Gordon Sondland meeting with Andrei Yermak, top advisor to President Zelensky, and then immediately thereafter, Sondland told you that he had informed the Ukrainians that if they wanted that $400 million in military aid, they were going to have to do those investigations that the President wanted.  And you were later informed, and this is also significant, as you've testified here today, that the Ambassador Sondland had a subsequent conversation with President Trump and informed you that it wasn't going to be enough for the Ukrainian prosecutor general to announce the investigations the President wanted.  President Zelensky had to do it himself if he wanted to get that aid, let alone the meeting in the White House.  Now, you've been asked to opine on the meaning of the term bribery.  although you weren't asked to pine on the meeting of the terms high crimes and misdemeanors.  But bribery for those watching at home is the conditioning of official acts in exchange for something of personal value.  The official acts we're talking about here are a White House meeting that President Zelensky desperately sought, and as you have acknowledged, Ambassador Volker, was deeply important to this country at war with Russia.  to show the United States had this new president back.  That meeting was important.  That meeting is an official act.  The military assistance is even more significant because Ukrainians are dying every day in their war with Russia.  And so the withholding of military assistance to get these investigations, which you now have acknowledged, Ambassador Volker, was wrong.  for the president to request, the idea of withholding that military aid to get these political investigations should be anathema to repugnant to every American because it means the sacrifice not just of Ukrainian national security but American national security for the interest of the president personally and politically.  Now, my Republican colleagues, all they seem to be upset about with this is not that the president an investigation of his political rival, not that he withheld a White House meeting and $400 million in aid.  we all pass on a bipartisan basis to pressure Ukraine to do those investigations.  Their objection is he got caught.  Their objection is that someone blew the whistle, and they would like this whistleblower identified, and the president wants this whistleblower punished.  That's their objection, not that the president engaged in this conduct, but that he got caught.  Their defense is, well, he ended up releasing the aid, yes, after he got caught.  That doesn't make this any less odious.  Americans may be watching this and asking, why should the United States care about Ukraine?  Why should we care about Ukraine?  And this was the import, I think, of the conversation, the now infamous conversation in that Kiev restaurant with Gordon Sondland holding the phone away from his head because the president was talking so loud.  What does the president ask in that call the day after the now infamous call he had with Zelensky?  What does he ask on that cell phone call?  Not whether the Rada had passed some new anti-corruption reform.  No.  Are the Ukrainians going to do the investigation?  Meaning into Biden.  And Sondland's answer is, they're going to do it.  They'll do essentially anything the president wants.  But what's more telling is the conversation, I think, that Sondland has with the Foreign Service Officer Holmes afterwards, in which the President says, basically, Donald Trump doesn't give an expletive about Ukraine.  He cares about the big things.  And Mr.  Holmes says, well, Ukraine's at war with the Russians.  That's kind of a big thing.  And Sondland's answer is, no, no.  He cares about big things that affect his personal interests.  This is why Americans should care about this.  Americans should care about what happens to our allies who are dying.  But Americans should care about their own national security and their own president and their own constitution.  And they will need to ask themselves, as we will have to ask ourselves in Congress, are we prepared to accept that a president of the United States can leverage official acts, military assistance, White House meetings, to get an investigation of a political rival.  We prepared to say, well, you know, I guess that's just what we should expect in a president of the United States.  I don't think we want to go there.  I don't think our founding fathers would have wanted us to go there.  Indeed, I think when the founding fathers provided a remedy, that remedy being impeachment, they had the very concern that a president of the United States may betray the national security interests of the country for personal interests.  They put that remedy in the Constitution, not because they wanted to willy-nilly overturn elections, no, because they wanted a powerful anti-corruption mechanism when that corruption came from the highest office in the land.  We are adjourned. ",
