            "text": "Hello, beautiful people.  It's me again.  So who knew that a five-minute video could cause such a ruckus?  So much so that I've gotten death threats from the Islamic Republic.  They've sent their cyber army to send me messages to intimidate me, to scare me, to stop talking.  Hit pieces have been written against me by particular media outlets on the left.  And many of you have reached out and said, Hey, what's going on in Iran?  Give us an update.  So here's a respite from the impeachment charade.  Since the elimination of Qasem Soleimani, the regime acknowledged and admitted that they downed that Ukrainian airliner and they lied about it.  They lied for three days to the international community.  They lied to the Iranian people.  And not only did they lie, but they had the audacity.  to intimidate family members not to talk to the media, otherwise they wouldn't get the remains of their families.  They forced families to go on state TV and acknowledge their loved one as a martyr for the revolution.  They buried the remains of those that were lost without letting their families see them for the last time.  This is the nature of the Islamic Republic.  All they know how to do is intimidate and lie.  They have held my people hostage for 41 years.  And not only have they lost all credibility with the Iranian people, but they are a criminal regime and have become the laughingstock of the international community.  Last week, there was a member of parliament who put out a bounty of $3 million out for Donald Trump.  You heard me correctly.  $3 million to kill the president of the United States of America.  Are you kidding me?  I mean, do they not understand that that is a gross violation of international law, an act of terror?  Yeah, so this is the nature of this regime.  We've had major flooding and mudslides in the south of Iran.  Why don't you take that $3 million and spend it on helping clean up the mudslides and helping those poor families and children that are living on top of mud.  I mean, look, for 41 years, the regime has squandered the wealth of a nation that is full of history and beautiful people.  And I'm so glad that we finally have an opportunity and I'm so grateful to be able to serve as a mouthpiece for the Iranian people to send their message out to the world.  So thank you guys for all the love and the support that you've sent me since that video went crazy viral.  I will continue to update you.  I'm working on a couple of interesting projects right now that I will let you know about at the right time.  But I love you guys.  Thank you.  And thank you for standing with the Iranian people.  I love you and God bless you. ",
