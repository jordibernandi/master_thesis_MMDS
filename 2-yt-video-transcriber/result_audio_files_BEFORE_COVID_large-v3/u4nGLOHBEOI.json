            "text": "when god made a covenant with abraham isaac and jacob.  from then on he would always have a special relationship with their descendants.  of those he chose certain men to be his holy prophets his mouthpiece here on earth.  they were mocked ridiculed but were never permitted to shy away from telling the truth.  Their lives weren't easy, facing harsh conditions, but they persevered.  They urged the people to repent, and for all their warnings, all of their prophecies always came true.  Here are 10 amazing facts about those prophets you probably didn't know.  1.  John was the greatest of all the prophets.  Out of all the prophets, over thousands of years, why did Christ, God himself, call John the greatest?  Whilst many of the prophets lived tough lives, and John was no exception here, living in the wilderness on locusts and honey, one thing truly stood out.  so john had great influence over the people enough to strike fear into the hearts of their rulers.  it can be estimated that millions of people all round the country travelled to the rivers to meet john.  the people were restless.  they were willing to do anything.  he asked even make him their leader but he never used that influence to start a rebellion and he himself was not consumed by what was going on in the world around him.  rather he was isolated from the world and he held to the mission which scripture had prophesied for him to announce the coming of the Messiah to prepare the way of Yahweh as it says in Isaiah.  for this amongst other reasons he was called by Christ the greatest of prophets.  Number two, almost every prophet has God in their name.  Although in the modern English translation it is not strikingly obvious, the word El means God and it's short for Elohim.  So names such as Samuel, Daniel, Ezekiel, Michael, Joel, Nathaniel, they all have the El at the end.  Now the word Yah is short for Yahweh, God's actual name, but it can also be translated with a J or an I. So we have Jeremiah, Isaiah, Obadiah, Zephaniah, Zechariah.  Each name also had a unique meaning and often was tied to the prophet's mission or purpose in life.  So what does your name mean and does it tie into your life?  There is more to the Jonah story.  Whenever one reads the Bible, if you study the history around that period, you will gain a much greater understanding.  And Jonah especially demonstrates this.  During the period of Jonah, Assyria was on the verge of becoming a superpower, an empire.  And it was only a matter of time before they invaded Israel.  Now Jonah realized if he didn't warn Assyria, then they couldn't repent and they'd be destroyed.  So Israel would be saved, and this is why Jonah tried to run away.  But there's more.  The Assyrians worshipped a half-fish, half-human goddess.  This goddess had a child which upon birth was fed and kept alive by doves.  Eventually the locals found her and named her Semiramis, which in ancient Syrian means dove.  Now Jonah in Hebrew also means dove.  And the Assyrians spoke a close Semitic language to Hebrew.  So when Jonah ends up in the whale and is cast upon shore, we have a man called Dove coming out of a fish.  And this is why they believe the prophet.  And who thinks that God has no sense of humor?  4.  Abel was the very first prophet.  Christ had many interesting things to say to the Pharisees.  One particularly was that of Abel accusing them of being responsible for the deaths of Abel to Zechariah, clearly referring to prophets in this context.  now abel does not have any words of prophecy attributed to him but that does not mean he was not a prophet.  the fact is very little is known about him.  however abel did perform a prophetic act by bringing a lamb to offer to god centuries before god gave the law that required it.  abel knew the promise of his parents of a saviour coming and by offering a lamb the very best of his flock as a sacrifice to god he was prophesying of the coming messiah the coming mission of jesus to die on behalf of his people.  that itself would make abel a prophet of god.  Number five, there are many more unnamed prophets.  In the Bible, we have the 16 books of the prophets, 16 men who got their own book describing their mission and the events that took place around their lives.  However, there are clearly a hundreds more mentioned, many of which are unnamed.  Some such as Gad and Nathan even had their own books, at least in the past.  but they now seem to be lost.  evidently that will mean that the Bible has been continuously changing over the centuries with books being added and removed.  it would seem that God made sure that in each time period we as a people had the necessary information available.  although it may seem at times that Satan runs the world God is truly the one in complete control.  never forget that.  number six every prophet reveals the coming of the Messiah.  Although each book of the prophets has different themes and surrounds different events, they all have one thing in common, revealing Christ one way or another.  Out of the major prophets, Isaiah reveals that the Messiah was to be born of a virgin, that he was to suffer, that he would speak in parables, in Jeremiah that the Messiah would bring a new covenant, in Ezekiel that he was to be the good shepherd to expose the bad shepherds, whilst Daniel gives an exact timeline of Christ's coming.  from the minor prophets micah reveals that he would be born in bethlehem malachi that messiah would be preceded by a messenger john the baptist in zechariah that the messiah would come riding in a donkey and there's many many more.  this is why the old testament is just as important as the new testament and without reading both you cannot truly understand the bible number seven.  daniel is the most disputed prophet in today's modern era.  the bible unfortunately is bashed and criticized more than ever and daniel by far has the most critics.  some try to claim he never existed while others will simply dispute his timeline.  now Daniel confirms the exact timing of the coming of Christ is undisputable.  he depicts the rise and fall of all the empires and even identifies a certain organization as the beast.  so it's no wonder that many would rather this book disappeared and therefore you must realize the hidden agenda behind it all.  by disputing Daniel what they are really doing is trying to dispute Christ, although subtly.  God said he would test us and test our faith, so stay strong and don't doubt the Bible.  Some Prophets Overlapped Each Other.  The books in the Bible are not all necessarily in chronological order, and so it can be difficult to determine what timeframe each prophet fell into.  However, when working it out, it does become clear that the ministries of the prophets often overlapped each other.  It's very possible.  some were contemporaries and perhaps even knew each other well.  Three of the major prophets, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel, for example, all lived at the same time.  Jeremiah being the older, senior, and around Jerusalem's siege, Ezekiel and Daniel were later both deported to Babylon together.  9.  Jeremiah traveled to and died in Ireland Most of the prophets, we don't know what happened to them after their books, what lives they lived, or how they died.  Some however have legends and are even recorded in history, one of those being Jeremiah.  When Nebuchadnezzar attacked Jerusalem, Jeremiah fled to Egypt with the king Zedekiah's daughter, Teotephi.  take him with him the stone of destiny.  now.  Jeremiah was warned by God.  Egypt was about to be invaded so once again fled first to Gibraltar then to Cornwall and then to Ireland.  now the king of Ireland was a descendant of the Judah Zeruli.  Upon arriving, Jeremiah married Teotephi to this king.  Since she was from the Judah-Pharaz line through David, this reunited the two Judah lines as prophesied and would uphold God's promise to David that there would always be a descendant of his on the throne.  Eventually this Irish throne moved to Scotland centuries later and then eventually to England.  taking the stone with them.  Queen Elizabeth can officially claim her descent all the way back to King David.  The line still exists to this day and God's promises never fail.  Number 10.  The third spirit of Elijah is here.  Although John the Baptist was the second Elijah to make way for the coming of the Messiah, There is also a prophecy of a third Elijah.  If Christ had a prophet for his first coming, he will also have one for his second coming.  However, this time it's slightly different.  Rather than one single person preparing the way, it will instead be a mass awakening, the spirit for the true children of Israel.  This is revealed in Malachi.  He shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers.  Meaning, the Israelites will finally wake up and remember their true heritage, who their fathers and ancestors were, where they came from, and this prophecy is being fulfilled now all around us before our eyes.
