            "text": "Okay, today is the 2nd of July 2019.  As the title down there suggests, I'm basically bitching and moaning about ESETI banning me.  The situation was that I had an opportunity to attend, which is very, this is a very rare, very difficult thing for me because of the health concerns of my wife.  And I was going to have a very brief, like, you know, one potential day opportunity.  Actually, maybe two days and a single night to go on over to East City.  And I haven't had a vacation since 1994.  So that will tell you something.  And I was going to do it.  I wanted to take my night vision goggles.  And go and see the full E-SETI experience and see the UFOs and the Space Brothers.  I was not so much interested in seeing Corey Goode or Jordan Sather or the Edge of Wonder guys or James Gillian.  Okay, my opinion of these individuals is low, but I was not going to allow their presence to affect my ability to interact with space aliens, presuming that that is, or interdimensional beings or whatever the fuck they are, presuming that that's what's actually going on at East City.  I wanted to determine for myself.  I've got night vision goggles.  I've got a shitload of various different kinds of electronic field recording equipment.  I was going to truck on over and start recording and seeing what's going on.  I've got my own lasers and laser vibration analysis devices.  So it was like I wanted to see what was going on.  Anyway, so long story is that I contacted ESETI to see what the accommodations were because My entree was as a gift from someone and I didn't know about the public posting of what the conditions and terms were, so I wanted to find out, you know.  And they responded by saying I couldn't come.  And they responded by saying, I couldn't come due to my belief system, due to my low opinion of James Gillian and Corey Goode and Jordan Sather and Edge of Wonder, as well as perhaps the other people.  I just don't know them and stuff.  Right.  Also, another reason I was going to attend was that there are people in attendance that I wanted to connect with, that I've had contact with and have a relationship with.  And it's like, I wanted to say hi.  That's sort of a deal, right?  So I was necessarily, or I was, okay, so I, under my circumstances, I had to see what were the constraints.  And so I sent them an email and they responded and said, you know, bugger off, you're not allowed to show up.  And they said, you're not allowed to show up because of your belief about these individuals and because we're trying to protect and preserve the mental, or not mental, but the vibrational state of their little conference thing.  and so i took from that that this was a religious or a belief system discrimination and that's illegal in our state.  okay these guys are offering a public venue and taking money from the public and they're reporting to a washington state tax authority all based on people attending this thing.  so they have to operate like any other kind of a conference any other kind of a concert any other kind of a public meeting publicly advertised taking money publicly and and reporting that to the tax authorities of the state.  and so i was offended.  i'm not a violent person.  i've made no threats against any of these individuals in spite of what they may be saying and i'm in no way a security risk to anyone and i. and if my mere presence was so disruptive there are some conclusions that can be gained.  Okay, if my presence was going to be so disrupting to these individuals, then these are little fragile eggshells that can't take any criticism whatsoever.  That's obvious on the face of it, just if they're afraid of me simply showing up.  And then other things that we can assume or make conclusions about is that maybe the effects that are touted at ESETI of talking with the space brothers and all of this kind of stuff only exist because of conditions that they create there and that these are not naturally occurring events.  In other words, they're tricks.  They're entertainment.  They're bullshit.  Maybe they don't indeed ever do anything that is accurate.  I know for a fact they're not reporting accurately.  about some things because I've seen on YouTube a video that was reported and talked about by Gillian and Jimmy Church that I know of.  And this video purports to be of a, as Gillian described it, I think he said it was like 1300 feet wide or it was like moving at 1300 miles per hour.  And it was like 150 feet wide UFO that comes zooming past somebody's cell phone camera.  And I've examined that film, and that's bullshit.  What they actually captured was a falcon in a hunting swoop.  It had all the characteristics of a falcon in a hunting swoop captured on the cell phone.  These people don't understand that it was close, it was not far away, and that had it been 150 feet wide, especially with some kind of a, even without, if it was just in free fall, it was 150 feet wide, It would have disturbed all of the plants and everything.  There would have been a huge amount of rushing leaves.  There would have been disturbances.  There would have been air everywhere all around it as it came whooshing down and was physically there.  They're claiming it was physically there.  It was 100 feet plus wide and it was moving at some ungodly speed, which I think I heard one of them say it was 1300 miles an hour.  How they estimated this, I don't know.  But I know it's not 150 feet wide.  I know it's not way back in the woods as they're maintaining because none of those trees are moving.  None of the grass is disturbed.  There's no dust being picked up.  And I live in this country.  You get a good willy wall, a good little dust double moving or a little bit of wind and you've got leaves and stuff everywhere this time of year.  And this was back last year, but nonetheless, this was not a UFO.  And so I know that they're not accurately reporting these things.  And they also don't understand how video cameras capture things, especially the video cameras that are on cell phones, because a lot of it is software manipulation to get you a decent image.  Something that the Edge of Wonder guys are quite prone to doing is, look at that, oh my God, oh my God.  And what they're doing is misinterpreting digital camera artifact as being some space alien or some spooky interdimensional woo-woo.  And so I like woo-woo.  I want to see interdimensional beings and interact with them and so on.  I'm not against woo-woo.  I'm not against James Gillian's stated goals.  I'm not against anything that they've said about that.  I'm against their misreporting and taking instantly anything that shows up as proof and evidence of their position.  I'm intensely critical of my own position and don't want to be self-deluding.  But I wanted to see.  I wanted to ascertain.  So I actually was willing to change my mind and form a different opinion.  And I figured that if I went for a couple of days to Yi Seti, I would come out either with my opinion confirmed or I would come out with it changed.  And either way was fine with me.  If I show up there and the conditions were exactly as they stated, I would make a video saying, holy fuck, holy fuck, look what I saw.  You know, that kind of shit, right?  But if, on the other hand, I found out that it was trickery and was deceit, I would say, holy fuck, deceit.  And if my opinion changed, of course, good, I'd be quite happy to state that.  You know, I don't give a shit.  I'm just reporting on reality.  I'm not trying to make reality conform to my wild ass opinions or stances.  In any event, here's the upshot of it all.  I think that anybody that is so disrupted by my appearance of just sitting there is guilty of some kind of fuckery and is expressing that guilt through rampaging paranoia that I might in some way be a danger to them.  I threaten no one physically ever.  I threaten ideas all the time.  I threaten ideas.  And if your ideas are so fragile that they can't handle being threatened, then they're not worth bringing into the public.  Ideas have to be tested.  There's an old Japanese saying, men and steel and ideas are tested by other men, other steel, and other ideas.  And if you're afraid of your ideas being tested, then you're admitting that they're too weak to stand up to it.  So this is my opinion currently of Corey Goode, that his ideas are so weak that he's unable and unwilling to do anything to allow them to come into conflict with any other idea.  The same thing is true of David Wilcock.  In fact, David Wilcock actually has physical reactions to his ideas being threatened.  You can see it in his movements, his mannerisms, and hear it in his voice, that he is disturbed by other ideas in conflict with his ideas.  I don't give a shit.  You can call me any damn name you want.  I'll be quite happy to sit there and debate you and not get all emotional and twisted up about it.  You can be as insulting as you wish, and I'll still talk with you, and I have proof of this.  I have people that don't like me, that think that they have an interesting opinion of me, and I still talk with them.  And I can cite C.W.  Chanter as someone of that nature.  So, you know, he and I have had a contentious relationship, and yet there's no... animosity between us because it's a contention of ideas, not a contention of our individual nature or whatever.  These people at East City offended me because they are banning me because of my ideas, because of my belief system.  So as far as I'm concerned, that's like un-fucking-American.  And that's also cowardly.  And so that's what I think, that they're un-fucking-American and they're cowardly.  And unfortunately, I'm old, I'm really pissed about it because of being denied this opportunity.  So I'm filing a fucking Washington State Human Rights Commission complaint.  And I'll take it as far as it'll go.  And I have the resources to pursue it individually as well as through the mechanism of the Human Rights Commission.  So, hey, ESETI, you didn't let me show up at your place.  I'll be happy to see you guys in Olympia at an administrative hearing when we discuss the ins and outs of RCW 49.60.  All right?  Banning someone on the basis of religion or belief is against the law in this state, assholes.  So, you know, and I hate to characterize people, but when you ban me, and the approach that your love and light administrator used was hurtful and it was basically fucking disgusting.  So I think you guys are assholes.  And I was willing to come there and let you prove me wrong.  Instead, you proved me correct in my opinion that you're small, petty-minded, and unable to deal with any outside interference with your narrow little bubble of understanding and all of your confirmation biases.  No, no, no, no, no.  We can't get outside of our confirmation biases.  We can't have any disturbing thoughts because we're so fragile.  And that's how it feels, dudes.  So we'll see you in the Human Rights Commission hearings.  I'm filing my complaint against you today.  It's an egregious little amount of work for me to have to go through to pursue this.  But it's worth it to me just to get your asses into Olympia and have you sit down in my presence and deal with my ideas.  So nice meeting y'all. ",
