            "text": "Masterable news fans, I'm going to have to continue coverage of the coronavirus that I began yesterday because new information has come out and in fact more information is coming out so fast that the media really isn't even able to keep up with it.  The situation unfolding in China is worse than initially thought.  Now, some of this information is not 100% confirmed, but a lot of it seems very true, but should also be taken with a grain of salt.  What we are now being told is that Wuhan is in a complete and utter lockdown.  Like completely, the roads, there are images of the roads being barricaded.  There are images of people being threatened in the military, turning people away who are trying to leave.  Like actually giant piles of dirt, road blocking Wuhan.  because it's now that bad.  Now, Wuhan is a city of 11 million people and they're already saying that the morgues are full.  If the morgues are full in Wuhan and it's a city of 11 million people, you're talking tens of thousands of people.  Now, keep in mind that Wuhan is also a major financial center Like, it's huge in terms of finance in China, and they're blockading that.  And they wouldn't be doing something that drastic to something that important unless they thought the benefit outweighed the cost.  Now, as it stands, there are reports of... Okay, the government is telling people, stay indoors, do not go outside, don't go to work, don't go to anything, any kind of a public event at all.  All Chinese New Year celebrations have been canceled, all of the movie theaters have been closed, zoos have been closed, all public things have been shut down.  Now, there are also reports that Chinese military planes are dropping chlorine powder on at least Wuhan in an attempt to disinfect the streets.  And this is why they're telling people to stay home and don't come out.  Now, due to the fact that the city is being blockaded, and that's not a... That is confirmed, that Wuhan is under a major lockdown.  It is being completely quarantined, and it's being... It's blockaded.  There are videos coming out of gunshots being fired over food riots, things like that, and... There's a lot of unconfirmed reports of people being killed in fights over food and water, etc.  All the stuff that you would expect to be true in a lockdown this big.  Now, what they are saying so far about the illness is that the disease is airborne.  You don't even have to have to have physical contact with anyone in order to actually catch it.  And the symptoms are different across all patients now.  Medical research places in other countries are saying that it looks like people are dying without displaying any symptoms.  This isn't 100% confirmed, but it seems like people are infected with it and spreading it and show absolutely no symptoms and then just suddenly dropping dead.  So the number of people who show symptoms of the flu or something like that are actually the minority.  Now, when asked for comment, a Chinese official said there is a full-on emergency plan, but declined to say what it is.  Now, if you have an emergency plan, but they're not sharing what it is publicly, that means two things.  That means one of two things.  Either there is no emergency plan or that emergency plan is almost apocalyptic in scale.  But we can't confirm that because they aren't saying what that emergency plan is.  We do know for a fact that biomedical research facilities across the world have dropped all other research in order to deal with this viral outbreak.  That much is confirmed.  The entire medical world is going 100% into this.  In fact, my roommate who goes to the University of Brock in Niagara, that Dr.  Stars, the head of viral contagions or viral research, has canceled all lectures for the next two weeks and is going to be having someone come in and take her place.  She's the head of infectious research, and she's taking off to go and do... Now, an alleged Brazilian government official made a statement online.  Again, completely unconfirmed.  Allegedly, a Brazilian official said that this is a bioweapon that has gotten out.  Now, there is a bioweapon research laboratory in Wuhan.  That is true.  But is this a bioweapon that's gotten loose?  There's no conclusive evidence of that yet.  Now, there are some points I want to make.  There's allegedly a video of a woman eating a bat and the coronavirus spread because that's not true.  One, that bat being eaten was being eaten in Palau.  It wasn't in China.  So the media is already misrepresenting that video.  Two, the bat was cooked.  So there isn't a problem.  I mean, well, if it was fully and thoroughly cooked, there wouldn't be a virus in it.  Now, here's probably the most important point that could be made.  China has put 20 cities under quarantine and a complete and total blockade of Wuhan.  This has cost the economy tens of billions of dollars.  Now, if this wasn't serious, they wouldn't be economically hurting themselves like this.  Business does come first, and they wouldn't be taking tens of billions of dollars in hits if this wasn't a complete and absolute emergency.  The real seriousness with how the Chinese government is dealing with this outbreak should tell us how serious it actually is.  No one goes this overboard with trying to deal with something small.  As they say, you know, 10,000, tens of thousands of people die in China every year from the regular flu.  And 6,600 Americans die every year from the regular flu.  But China isn't putting up massive borders and quarantines for that and taking massive hits to the economy for that.  But they are doing it for this reason.  Which means it is something that is extremely dangerous.  That is a massive lethal threat.  Now there's a lot of estimations that are being made without the full data being available that put this on record.  anywhere from a huge scale to an apocalyptic scale.  None of this can be verified because not all of the information is available to the public, and some of it has not even yet been uncovered.  But if China is going to this degree, and biomedical facilities around the world are going to this degree, There has to be something very serious going on here for this to be such a big deal.  And I think that this, according to some reports, it's been alleged that mid-level government officials were trying to cover this up in China.  But once it got out of hand, higher level government officials found out about it.  And now something's being done.  Allegedly, this is what's happened, that the mid-level government has been responsible for covering this up.  Not the actual full Chinese state, but some few officials.  And of course, if those officials are found to have covered stuff up, you can pretty much guarantee that we're never going to see them again.  So again, there's a lot of misinformation running around.  A lot of people claiming things, saying this has to do with eating bats, something it has to do with... A lot of complete and utter nonsense.  But we do know this for a fact.  The quarantines alone, and the seriousness with which the Chinese government is dealing with this, and viral labs and biomedical facilities across the world are treating it... is pretty much all we need to know in terms of seriousness for this case.
