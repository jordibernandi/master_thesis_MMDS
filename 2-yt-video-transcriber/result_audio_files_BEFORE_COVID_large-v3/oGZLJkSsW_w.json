If I heard that the Clintons were running a pedophile ring out of a pizza parlor, if I felt that it was true and I was in the mood to sort of think that it was true, I'd be justified in thinking that it was factually true.  Is that what you're saying?  Well, like, you also need some, like, facts to go along with it to understand it, you know?  Like, you can't just, like, make a claim and then... Okay.  What is more important in your decision-making, both of you guys, when it comes to accepting a claim, whether it's that Kennedy was shot by Lee Harvey Oswald or anything along those lines, which one carries more weight in your view?  The mood?  The facts.  Okay.  Okay.  Good.  I think that's good.  Do you guys have any questions for me?  What are you going around doing that for?  I'm kind of thinking of giving you an answer that might make you feel good and just convince you that way or just give you some facts.  You want some facts.  No, it's a good question.  I'm trying to model a way of investigating claims that people make.  by asking questions because I don't know if you've ever butted heads with people before about some of the conspiracy theories.  usually what happens is that let's say that I really think that Lee Harvey Oswald killed Kennedy because I think you currently think that maybe he doesn't.  I might start giving you facts to show that that's not the case.  but what tends to happen is we usually tend to ignore the facts And believe what we believe even more because of maybe the feelings like you mentioned at the start.  The mood I happened to be in when I first heard the claim.  Oh, yeah.  So this is a way of asking questions to really get down to what's really motivating you to hold the claim in the first place.  Yeah, I get you.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, thank you for your time.  Let me give you a card.  Oh, thank you.  And you can check out my channel if you'd like.  If you search for those words and then my name, Anthony, on YouTube, you'll see my stuff.  Nice.  That was really cool.  Thanks for letting me practice doing that over FaceTime. ",
