            "text": "Thank you very much.  And to my colleagues, let me say good afternoon to you and plus the members of the audience.  According to John's letter, he indicated to me that he wants me to speak to develop a national plan.  And John, that's what I'll try to do for you very quickly.  But let me preface that by simply saying that if you hear about reparations, get this very firmly fixed in your mind.  You're not here for a pile of discussion.  It's not something to talk about.  that's nice.  If you don't get reparations, black folk, you're through in this country.  Let me be that very specific for you.  You see, what's happening to black Americans is that black Americans have been systematically, socially indigeneered into the lowest level of a real-life monopoly game.  You do not own and control a sufficient amount of anything to be competitive in America.  And you've been marginalized now for 400 years.  You're getting ready to be buried.  You can get buried under at least a whole broad groups of ambiguous groupings.  That's everything from culture groups, language groups, and gender groups.  You're going down.  It's no longer an issue.  You better get reparations and get it fast.  Now, to get reparations, one of the things I've been trying to do now for 30 years, beginning with the state of Florida when Governor Rubin asked you to put me over education when they had no blacks in politics in Florida, was to write the first affirmative action plan in the United States, and that was written to be reparations for black folk in 1971.  And George Bush  Jr.,  I guess, what's his name, Jed Bush, just killed it off about six months ago.  But what's happening now is that what I'm trying to do is create a Harvest Institute that will try to take all my colleagues here and as much as possible try to give you new points of information that take you outside the box.  Part of the problem we've got in trying to deal with reparations and a lot of the other racial issues in the country is that we keep trying to think and find solutions inside the box.  There are no solutions inside the box for black folk.  You've got to get outside and try to find and get a long-term perspective and a long view on it.  And that's what the Harvest Institute is in existence for, and that's what they're going to stay in existence for.  Now, the reason you cannot win, as I said, is that you've been locked into this low level of a real-life monopoly game.  You do not own and control enough of wealth.  See, in 1860, for instance, black folk, as a direct result of slavery, had an ownership.  When you were 98% slaves, you had an ownership of one-half of 1% of this nation's wealth in 1860 on the eve of the Civil War.  Now, this is the richest country in the world, the most capitalistic country in the world.  And here you are 140 years after slavery when you're supposedly 100% free and you still only have one half or 1% of this nation's wealth.  You cannot compete.  The typical average white person in America has 3,500 times more money than you have.  And that's not true only of blacks in America.  It's true of the world internationally.  What's happening right now is blacks is a marginalized subordinated class of people all over the earth.  You have one half of one percent of wealth in this nation, you same thing is true all over the world.  In the world there's approximately 392 trillion dollars worth of wealth on the earth.  And black folk around in the world have less than one percent ownership of it.  That includes all the African countries.  That includes Brazil, Caribbean, and America.  You don't own enough control of anything.  Whites control almost 100% of all the wealth, power, resources, privileges, and controls of all levels of government.  You're playing a game you can't win.  You've got to get reparations.  Now, how are you going to get it?  Let me give you a run-through of three or four things very quickly because I don't want to take up your time here.  First thing you must do, I've heard it mentioned already, we've got to commit a national campaign all over this country to start publicizing the issue of reparations for black folk.  Not as something nice, but as a necessity, period.  That means every living soul, every organization, every institution in this country must begin to start promoting reparations for black folk all over this country.  That's level one.  It's a massive, massive promotion of reparations for black folk.  Second level, level two.  What we must do at second level two now is to start having facts-finding hearings.  You must have facts-finding hearings all over this country.  And you're going to have facts-finding hearings on at least two different levels.  One is you're going to go after facts-finding about what roles governments have played in the reparations, I mean in the reparations.  in the slavery trade against black folk and the enslavement of black folk, the marginalization of black folk.  And that should break down into two levels.  One is to investigate all levels of domestic governments, that's city, county, federal, and state governments.  And the second group would go after international.  So you should have two groups of black folk in this country exploring and fact-finding on what roles government have played, one domestically and one internationally.  On the left-hand side, you should be doing the same thing for the domestic side.  You should be going after the private sector.  You should be going after all the private corporations in the United States, what roles they played and how they benefited directly from slavery.  And also, on the same side, you must go after all the international corporations and the roles they played and how they benefited.  Now, the Harvest Institute right now, my think tank, we've already picked up one.  We put out a press release on that.  We are going after domestic... Domestic role that major corporations played in the United States.  We've already identified approximately 240 companies that are still in existence that profiteer directly and enrich themselves off of black folk.  We're going after that.  And what we have to do in our fact-finding is be able to factuate, document the direct line between how blacks have been crippled all the way up to economically, politically, socially, and educationally and tie it into these major corporations or tie it into levels of government.  That's your level two.  Level three, you must then start having a national convention in this country.  And right now, I think Dorothy Tillman in Chicago has already talked about this.  She's going to try to call one in Chicago this coming year.  We must have everybody who's playing a role, like Congressman Conyers and everybody from the Congress in Cobra, everybody should be at a national convention where we all come in there to not only energize each other, but to share information, see where we are.  They're trying to set it up for this coming February someplace in the United States, possibly Chicago.  That's your third level.  The fourth level you start doing is trying to get into, trying to, out of this conference to come strategies and plans and a specific role model.  You got to have a role model, a model, not a role, a model that every black can tie into.  A model for reparations.  Now, my model is a little different from everyone else's, and that's because I'm outside the box.  I'm trying to pull everybody else outside if I can get them.  Now, most people are going to try to follow the Jewish reparations model or the Japanese model.  I'm following the Indian model.  The Indians are the most appropriate model if you want to track down doing anything to get reparations for black folk.  Why?  Because, you see, only American Indians and black folk were spelled out in the Constitution.  The Indians owned reservations and black folk.  There's a direct lineage between those two groups.  And if you really want to track and get reparations, the easiest and quickest way is to go find out what happened to American Indians, what benefits they got, and track it.  In my new book called Power Numbers, it takes you through every one of those steps so you can follow it.  If you pick that up, you can come right to reparations very quickly because it would be very difficult for the government to deny black folk the same thing they're giving the Indians.  So when you hear people talking about how bad off Indians are, first thing you say, fine, if Indians are that bad off, put us as black folk in the same status with the Indians.  We'll take that.  Because see, what Indians got, see, first of all, nobody declared Indians to be a nation.  Indians declared themselves to be a nation.  They declared themselves to be a nation all the way up until about 1832 when Supreme Court Justice Marshall said, okay, I'll recognize you as a nation.  We never declared ourselves to be a nation.  We've always tried to do just the opposite of what the Indians did.  Once they became a nation, they drew up a constitution for themselves.  We never had a constitution.  And what the Indians did with that constitution is then go to the United States government and say, we do not want to integrate.  We did just the opposite.  We integrated.  And I can track everything right down.  We can follow the Indian model if you want to.  And you can see all that's already built into the law.  And there's a direct lineage between American Indians and black folk that you can follow very easily and get to reparations.  But we need to have a model.  And in my new book, I get that knowledge to be on the stand in about another month.  You get the power dynamics model.  that'll take you through all those steps of what they did throughout history from the Blair Amendments and everything else.  You can track them very easily and it'd be very difficult for the United States government to deny you reparations when you're only two people that have a constitutional relationship with this government is black folk and Indians.  Just like Indians use natural, what they call natural rights and lay their claim against the land, we should use natural law and lay a claim against our labor, misappropriated labor.  The next level, what you must do is begin to, is move to a legal step.  You need to form at the fourth level, get you a legal body right now, whether it's going to be pro bono or paid.  And out of our convention, we should be able to raise some funds to set up a mass legal body that will be ready to start serving suits based on those facts that you're going to find at the second level.  And we should start to find those, and we should have people going after suits.  One side suing the different levels of government, the other side suing the private sector to get reparation funds for black folk.  Then at the last level, at the sixth level, you need to set up some kind of a pool, a resource or retrieval agency that every time we get some benefits, we'll go into a special fund that will be held for pooling and aggregating.  Now, then out of that special agency, we break away into two groups, what I would recommend.  One, you would have an economic development bank on the East Coast and economic development bank on the West Coast.  And what those banks would do is take most of the money you get and not give it to black folk as individuals.  You put it into a massive bank where black folk can go draw that money to start low interest, get low interest loans or free money to build businesses and industries throughout the United States.  You also, if you track the Indians, you should go for, try to get yourself some tax-free, tax-exempt land.  Just like Indians can go grab any piece of land and federalize and put up a casino, you tell me you ought to do the same thing as a black person, get tax-exempt statuses.  We can go on and on.  But there's a lot of things we can track.  Go after the Indians.  But the thing that's most important, and I'm going to quit, is that you've got to understand that reparations are an absolute necessity.  We're going to get buried alive.  We do not have enough to be able to compete in this society.  And the further we get away from the civil rights movement, the worse things are going to get.  And when people start talking about slavery, don't just talk about slavery.  Talk about Jim Crow slavery and benign neglect.  You've got to understand what slavery was.  Slavery is the illegitimate child of racism.  Racism still exists.  That's slavery.  Because what racism does, racism keeps and maintains what was created by slavery.  Now, racism is a competitive economic struggle between groups of people for power and wealth.  Thank you.  And it's slavery.  and racism never existed until the 16th century.  And when slavery went out of existence, racism took over.  Racism has gone from being meaning slavery to being something biological.  Then it moved on in about the 1800s.  It turns to be something as a personal behavior or an attitude and now bias and a prejudice.  I mean, racism has nothing to do with attitudes, with prejudice and with bias.  Racism is a competitive group contest between people for race, resources and for superiority.  And racism is a race without a finish line.  I thank you very much. ",
