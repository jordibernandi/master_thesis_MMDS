            "text": "First thing I'd like to say is, all my wonderful subscribers, you guys are the greatest.  I just wanted to tell you that before I started.  And I'm going to get right to it.  Hey Joe, open your envelope.  Neil Perlroth, technology reporter at the New York Times, took to Twitter to slam the social media outlet for failing to ban evidence of Biden touching women and children inappropriately.  In her tweet, the pedophile defender referred to the images as alt-right fake news, much to the anger and confusion of her followers who pointed out en masse that the videos of Biden were self-incriminating.  Have you guys seen those?  Crazy.  The freethoughtproject.com reports, it appears that this cyber security reporter for the New York Times has missed the bus when it comes to the disturbing images of the insanely creepy former vice president groping, whispering to, trying to kiss, and otherwise making women and children feel incredibly uncomfortable.  The meme, quote unquote, as Pearl Roth called it, is neither outright fake news or new.  Smashing her partisan slant on the issue, the Free Thought Project has reported on this instance before, just like they have on Republican President George H.W.  Bush and his propensity to grope women and underage girls.  In fact, The inappropriate sexual behavior in Washington, D.C.  has become so rampant that it is costing, get this, taxpayers millions of dollars in hush money.  Why should we pay for that?  They ought to pay for their own lawsuits.  I mean, come on.  The TFTP reported a congresswoman has come forward and claim that the U.S.  House of Representatives alone has spent $15 million in taxpayer funds to settle sexual misconduct lawsuits.  Let me say that again.  $15 million in taxpayer funds to settle sexual misconduct lawsuits of politicians in the last decade.  Now, that's the House of Representatives.  That's not even including the Senate.  The claim was made by Representative Jackie Speier, a Democrat from California, during an interview on Meet the Press Daily with MSNBC's Chuck Todd.  When asked about the process sexual assault victims currently have to go through, Speier noted that they have to start by promising to stay silent.  we really need to reform the entire Office of Compliance process, Spear said.  Right now, it takes about 90 days for you to file a complaint, and before actually going through the mediation, you have to sign a non-disclosure agreement.  Keep your mouth shut.  Tick a lock.  And then you are not represented by counsel, but the harasser... the Senator or Congressman, is represented by the House of Representatives General Counsel.  So you don't get a lawyer.  The person filing the claim don't get one.  The Congresswoman, who is a member of the House Intel Committee, then added that the sum of those taxpayer funded, get this, taxpayer funded, me and you, settlements are not small and it's been building up over the last 10 years.  We do know that about 15 million that has been paid out by the House on behalf of harassers in the last 15 years.  That's a million dollars a year.  Could some of this money have gone to silence the myriad of women and children seen in videos of Joe Biden creepily molested them in front of the world?  Indeed, it could have.  The Gateway Pundit reported a former Secret Service agent assigned to Vice President Joe Biden residents claims that the service often had to protect female agents from him.  Speaking on the condition of anonymity, The agent asserted that we had to cancel the vice president's Christmas get together at the vice president's house because Biden would grope all of our wives and girlfriends butts.  The annual party was for agents and Navy personnel who were tasked with protecting the Biden family.  Get that.  He would mess with every single woman or teen.  It was horrible, the agent said.  To discount the rampant abuse in Washington,  D.C.,  and some ploy to paint your political opponents as creators of fake news is irresponsible, to say the least.  Just this Thursday, New Jersey Democrat Senator Bob Menendez was accused of hiring child prostitutes, had his federal corruption trial end in deadlock.  Meanwhile, the media completely ignored it.  The media's attempt to cover for the hush and hush the alleged crimes of  D.C.'s  elite is so overt, as TFTP reported, was witnessed on a recent episode of C-SPAN's Washington Journal, on which Washington Times reporter Stephen Denon and host Pedro Echeverria were discussing President Trump's presidential advisory commission on election integrity.  But when a caller brought up pedophilia and dropped a few names, Echeverria cut him off and refused to address the caller's concerns.  Hush them up on Democrats, right?  President Trump, let's attack him.  That's their deal.  In April of last year, Dennis Hassert, former Speaker of the House, who is an admitted child rapist, was sentenced to 15 months in prison after he was caught paying his victims to keep quiet.  However, he was released in July, two months before finishing his already insultingly lenient sentence.  And there was media silence.  Crickets.  As more and more of these political elite predators get exposed, we can't expect to see calls for censorship increase.  We can't expect it.  We can expect them to call for an increase in censorship because it's Democrats.  Now, we can't attack Democrats, right?  They're snowflakes.  Pearl Roth would do well to consider the above facts before being part of the problem.  if sunlight is the best disinfectant.  You can find compilation videos of former President Joe Biden creepily fondling and smelling and whispering to children and women all over YouTube.  All you gotta do is look for it and you'll find it.  So my question, why is the media silent on all this?  They put President Trump under a microscope down to what he does every minute of every day.  Yet they refuse to discuss a Congress slush fund of taxpayer money to pay out sexual harassment lawsuits against congressmen.  Why does the taxpayer have to pay for their indiscretions?  Why are they silent on Creepy Joe Biden when videos are posted all over the internet of Creepy Joe funneling children in an inappropriate way?  I saw one video of Creepy Joe kissing a little six or seven year old boy on the lips.  I would rather President Trump to waste a few hours on Twitter than Creepy Joe molest children on national television for the whole world to see, only to stay silent and do nothing.  The sad part, this is the really sad part, people will actually vote for this man in the Democratic primary.  And that's the Giggling Conservative for today.  Y'all take it easy.  All my loyal subscribers, you guys are the greatest. ",
