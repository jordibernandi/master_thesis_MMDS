It means that you follow man-made rules.  It has nothing to do with nature, obviously, because it is unnatural.  You live the way somebody else wants you to live, seeing as veganism has been around for a while, but it only got popular in 2010, approximately.  It's a belief system that they adapted.  It has nothing to do with human health.  Vegans don't care, and most actually hate humans.  Plants don't have over 15 micronutrients, and the macronutrients are also different, but it's a different story.  Most people never want to talk about the micronutrients, even the ones who are not vegan but say that vegans are doing the right thing.  They don't understand nutrition.  These people actually talk as if they do.  They talk about fiber and all the vitamins and minerals all the time but they don't name any.  Subconsciously, of course, the vegans realize that they are not getting any of the vitamins and minerals that they speak of because they don't feel right.  This is why they imitate the dairy, eggs and meat.  Their bodies want those foods, but they are so delusional and brainwashed that they don't realize that by eating those fake so-called foods, they are not actually getting anything out of them.
