            "text": "Christmas is full of a lot of things.  I know as a Christian pastor and father that Christmas has basically absorbed a lot that has nothing to do with the birth of Christ at all.  But Christ is the centerpiece and the focus of Christmas.  That's where we must concentrate if we want to really celebrate what God accomplished in the birth of His Son.  But if part of that celebration is expressing love to your family, giving gifts to each other, in a way thanking the Lord for all that He's done in your life and expressing love to your family, I think that's a great thing.  Sending Christmas cards to people to express love and to honor Christ, that's a great thing.  And oh, by the way, some people have issues with Christmas trees.  My response to that is, God made trees.  If you have plants in your house, if you have flowers in your garden, if you have trees in your yard, why would you make anything other than a joyous reality of a tree that's in your house?  I know one of my very favorite things to do every year is to decorate the Christmas tree at our house because all our decorations, they're not store-bought, all of our decorations are basically tied to the history of our family.  They were made by our children, They were made with pictures of our children.  Every single one of those decorations has a piece of our family history.  And so when I decorate the tree, it gives me the opportunity to go back through the history of our family and rejoice in all the good things that the Lord has done.  You don't want to put anything out of Christmas that you can use to glorify the Lord.  And that includes a tree and showing generosity and giving gifts of love, as well as focusing on worshiping the Lord himself. ",
