Now, this morning, Brandon, we're hearing the Chicago police have shifted the investigation.  They no longer consider him a victim.

It's like the boy that cries wolf.  And what it does is it sets a very dangerous precedent and it puts a real... I think it puts an unwarranted pressure on these situations when they come up before.  And it's like people will never believe you when you actually have these scenarios and situations.  However, I strongly disagree with Brandon, the fact that racism is essentially non-existent.  America's carpet has lumps in it because we swept racism up under the rug for so very long in this country.
