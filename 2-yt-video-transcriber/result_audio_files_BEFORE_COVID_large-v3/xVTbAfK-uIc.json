            "text": "Howdy, lieutenants and economists.  The most volatile, evil, disgusting things on the planet, humans.  If you have a video request, you can always go to assholeconsulting.com.  Yeah, I am gonna charge you, kids.  And that is the importance of not fucking up.  You are such an asshole!  Dear Cappy, a lot of people seem to be holding out for some kind of supposed collapse that's coming.  In some cases, hoping that it will offer a remedy to average or a little above average guys.  When it comes to the sexual marketplace, whatever is coming is supposed to shake everything up and basically reset all social dynamics.  It's almost become a red pill trope by now.  You've probably seen the image at the bottom of this email and the image he attached is from the Hunger Games where... The actress Jennifer something.  There's the bow and arrow.  How women imagine the post-apocalyptic and then how it will really be.  And it's poor gals down in Venezuela being prostitutes.  Just whoring on the street.  I was out with a couple of friends last night and saw something that's never happened before.  We were at a downtown bar.  Mistake number one.  The bitch shields are up.  If you don't know what bitch shields are, look up bitch shields.  Okay, the bitch shields are up.  Don't even bother.  Don't even bother going out downtown.  That's your mistake.  And two girls came in by themselves and stood somewhere back behind me.  So I gave it a shot.  I mean, why not?  No, I agree, but you're in the wrong environment.  I turned back to say, hey, I think I saw you two when I came in.  They looked at each other small and looked at me without saying anything.  Anything.  You guys were at the front bar, right?  They said nothing.  I said, well, I'm Bill.  I hope you girls are having a good night.  What's your name?  Said, dude, A plus for effort.  Not A plus for effort, but wrong environment.  To the girl closest to me, one father responded, actually, we're going to keep our names private and not interested, but see ya, giving me a thumbs up.  As you would a retarded homeless person insulting you in the street.  I... This is new.  That's new?  That's kind of par for the course, especially with nightclubs.  Not too long ago, as in months, women in social nighttime venues would still talk to you if you approached to strike up a conversation.  Ah, months?  I don't know where you are.  Your big town must be a small big town because it's been years, man.  It's been years.  And it is also highly... city dependent.  If you were in Chicago in the 90s, girls were very friendly.  To this day, as reported to me by agents in the field, if you were a decent looking guy in New York, you could still get away with it.  But most of the rest of the first world country for Western civilization, you're going to get shot down.  I mean, you could talk to Roosh about this.  He's more traveled and experienced, but... And even his books are somewhat dated because the dynamics have changed in the past 10 years.  So I don't know if it's months, and maybe you're at one of the last holdouts where, dude, only months ago?  Congratulations, that sounds like a very nice place.  But that is industry standard now, where girls will just rebuke any kind of event, even if they are interested in you, I hate to say it.  We've been disrespected in similar but varying forms and degrees by women the past several times.  we've gone out to socialize.  Well, if you're going out at nighttime, again, look up bit shields.  I relayed what happened to a friend of mine that night, and he repeated what has basically become his mantra.  Nah, man, just sit tight for now.  It's women's world.  Things are going to be like that until the collapse.  You see, they can get away with stuff like that, the way the system's set up now.  No, they can get away with it any time.  But when the collapse comes, women's attitudes towards men and the way men are valued is going to be turned on its head.  That is true.  That will be true.  I've heard similar projections, predictions with no real specifics.  Usually I direct people to your video that talks about how no real bubble is being pumped up right now to pop.  I don't know about this collapse.  People I follow who seem to know what they're talking about even have conflicting ideas on this.  Well, that's understandable because no one knows really how it's going to play out.  or what the collapse will be.  There's some things we can assume and guess.  They'll probably be very likely.  But this is not a science.  You're predicting the future.  So certainly people are going to have... I hesitate to call it conflicting but differing opinions.  And they truly are opinions.  They're not going to argue whether one is right or not.  They're just, well, you've got a good point there.  Oh, I can see it happening this way.  Where do we go?  I posed this scenario to a well-known red pill author who holds local happy hours.  He responded, We probably won't see anything like that in our lifetime.  I'll agree with him or her.  I tend to agree and think that most collapses would not be survivable, and if they were, your sexual market value would probably be the last thing on your mind.  You don't want to collapse.  No, you like, like, trust me, you like electricity and running water and not Ebola or the Black Plague running rampant because no one can make the fucking antidote.  Guys pushing this seem to think they would just be able to skate and not suffer any of the fallout, much like the people who kept their jobs in 2008.  They imagine just going around and taking their pick of single attractive interested women.  It's not how it's going to be.  I don't know about you, but I don't want to starve.  I like where I live.  2008 was bad enough and it took a couple years for me and many to recover and continue building.  I also think it's a little passive and beta to wait for the collapse and hope that the girls won't be able to turn us down like they are now.  If you are relying on... economic collapse to get girls to like you, you have failed.  I'm not saying you got to go and dedicate your life to them, but if you're just sitting around, and you are, it is beta-ish.  I'm like, oh, the economy's going to collapse.  Then they'll come and suck my dick.  That's laziness.  That's what it is.  I like... Actually taking action and making things happen.  Good for you.  I like walking up to the girls now as the world is and seeing what's up.  You don't have a choice.  You go to war with the soldiers you got.  You approach the girls with the generation of women you have.  I'm just happy it wasn't a millennial.  I like your views on the supposed collapse and what form it would take, if any.  All right.  Well, let's go one by one here with your multiple questions.  I don't know what form it will take.  And into what gradation or severity.  I thought the housing bubble was kind of like the big all Not total economic collapse that this was the comeuppance.  This was the punishment.  but then the government bailed everybody out and then we voted in the socialists and The United States got bailed out by the fact that the rest of the world is even more corrupt than us.  They're not as productive as us.  We're the world's largest gun.  We have the world's largest military and and we have the world's reserve currency.  Even though we caused the global financial crisis, but everybody else was so much further up shit crick and so much more corrupt than us, they all ran for U.S.  dollars.  They were getting out of the U.S.  dollars, but then they all went running back.  Very interesting economic phenomenon.  So... That did not, we bailed ourselves out of that.  We got by cheating, essentially, at economics, which I think we can do for quite some time.  until the world comes around and actually there's a large enough economy or a cartel of economies that are large enough to present alternative currency to the us dollar the united states and americans can get away with their sloth and postpone this collapse.  venezuela no.  greece no.  any country that's not as big as us and is more corrupt than us.  they can't get away with it but we'll be able to get away with it.  i think until you and i are dead and i i'm thinking you're younger than me.  matter of fact i know you're because you sent a picture.  um so i don't know what the collapse would be.  um i think a collapse we might see in our lifetime.  Again, huge economic recession is when the millennials, enough baby boomers and Gen Xers die off and the millennials and Gen Zers take over and the millennials never wake up and they vote in open borders.  We could collapse the United States pretty quick then, but I'll be pretty old by that time.  And again, I don't know if it'll be a collapse as much as a very crippling slowdown.  So the collapse or, you know, who knows?  China invades.  I don't know.  And then there could be a much more abrupt collapse.  But I can't tell you what it's going to be.  I mean, it's either going to be long and slow and decaying like the Roman Empire, or it could be very rapid and quick.  I don't know.  and what the day-to-day US life would look like.  It's gonna look more socialistic.  It's gonna look lower standards of living.  We'll look more like Italy or France or dying Europe.  We'll have all this free stuff.  But we won't have economic... We'll have all this free stuff, then we'll wonder why, you know, true capitalistic kinds like Hong Kong and Korea are doing better than us.  We'll wonder, like, well, how come Russia has 7%?  Jesus Christ, even Mexico, for God's sake.  Why does Mexico have the same standards of living that we do?  What's going on?  We're America.  So it'll be a slow, inexorable decline.  Um... Things will get very expensive, kind of like things are now.  Education is very expensive.  Healthcare is very expensive.  Housing is very expensive.  You'll say, well, there's no inflation.  I'm like, really?  The money's got to go somewhere, and it does.  It goes to places where you borrow money because that's how the money enters the financial markets and the economy.  It goes through the banks.  So the banks lend it out at very low interest rates and wherever you borrow money for.  So things go up in price.  You can look at U.S.  cities to see what it's like.  Seattle, San Francisco, very expensive, traffic jammed, feces on the street, pathetic white people, panhandling, tattoos and shaved heads and pierced earrings and ear gauges.  You can see what it's going to look like.  People are going to get uglier.  They're going to get fatter.  We're going to be lazier.  I already know your views from the other video about a possible upcoming recession, that there isn't a housing or stock market bubble per se that could just pop right now and ruin everything.  Yeah, and even if there was an asset bubble that did burst, I don't see it being so big as a percentage of the economy like the last housing bubble was that it would actually tank the rest of the U.S.  economy.  I've heard currency of the U.S.  is out of ammunition to bite the combat recession, trade wars being unsustainable and eventually wearing us down.  I don't know what that means.  Who'd you hear that from?  It doesn't sound like a versed economist, in my opinion.  Also, I like your views on how such a collapse of the next 2008, if there even is one, would really impact intersexual dynamics.  Like a video response, please let me know your price, please give me an honest photo mention below.  Okay, so your primary thesis or question is, will a collapsing economy, a reset of the economy, reinstitute or bring back traditional sex roles, gender roles?  I would say it depends.  If it's not a true collapse, not like one that the other red pill guy that hosts things, if it's not a true collapse where the electricity is out and, oh, we got to get back to You know, women aren't worried about whether hubby bought them a Range Rover, where you're not worried about your student loan debts because you couldn't make a payment because the electricity is not on.  Then we're going to be forced to go back to the traditional roles that two million years of human evolution designed for us as basically back to square one.  I'd say we might even go back further than that.  Where you would have warlords, you know, you complain about the top 20% of guys taking 80% of the women now.  You know, talk about King David and his 3,000 concubines.  There's going to be some badass dudes and you could talk to any peddlers of vice and they will tell you pussy has the highest value.  Forget drugs, forget drugs.  Oxycontin, forget what, it's pussy.  That will become, and they will be raped and pillaged and the Vikings will come and they will take the women.  They will come after your women.  Where are your women?  Men will have to man up and then maybe with the semblance of civilization, like a very basic frontiersman-like civilization, girls are gonna, oh wow, here's Bob and Bob has a gun.  Okay, I'm gonna stick with Bob.  We're talking a major economic collapse.  Using the last Great Recession, a very serious and dark time, nothing really, there wasn't a change in sexual, I think it just kept on plodding along towards the feminist spectrum of the feminist freedom spectrum, or feminism, traditionalism, whatever, evil.  good, it went more evil.  Maybe it slowed down a little bit.  I know from a purely economic standpoint, there were articles coming out in 2008, 2009, where the price of prostitution was going down.  Women were selling their bodies online and in person more cheaply than they were before.  So I guess that, I mean, that would happen in economic recession.  That's what happens in Venezuela now.  They're really, your picture that you attached is, very germane.  Yeah, that's about the only thing that men really want.  And that'll become very apparent in a post-apocalyptic and an economic recession.  We see that a little bit now, though, with the economy happening, where we've printed off so much damn money, and we keep loaning money to people for their student loans.  It drives up the cost of tuition.  And now girls are effectively resorting to some form of digital prostitution or digital prostitution-lite to pay off their student loans.  I'm not against it.  Again, very libertarian ladies.  By all means, if you can make $300 an hour selling... Use bathwater, please.  If you can sell a used bathwater for $30 a bottle, do it, ladies.  And you don't need an economist to tell you that.  But I don't think, unless it's a truly, like there's no more government.  That would be.  the main thing is there is no more government for women to go run to to collect safety, security, in the form of the police or the military or financial with WIC and welfare where the only thing is a man or... What I predict will happen is the local warlord and strongman will come in with his team of equally large and strong men.  They will pay homage.  They'll try and be within that guy's concubine.  uh that that is what's going to require once the u.s government.  once the government is gone and there is no more government checks so the government checks are inflated away.  then women will go back to traditional.  but as long as there's law and order and the dollar has some value which i think it will until you and i are dead.  um women are not going to be forced into that.  those barbaric times um barbaric traditional we're gonna take.  choose your poison.  um But if there's an economic slowdown, eh, the price of a blowjob might go from $100 to $80 on the street.  The price of hotels went down.  The price of gas, I remember the recession.  It was great in some regards.  You got $5 footlongs.  Prices did come down.  But I don't think, unless there's a true economic collapse, you're going to see any fundamental change in intersexual dynamics.  And you can expect girls like that to be rude because the electricity is still on.  Yeah, so I'm sorry, I don't know.  Why are you going to nightclubs?  Why are you going downtown to a downtown bar?  What is wrong with you?  Think of all the time you wasted.  Yeah, that's what I predicted.  I can't predict anything because all predictions come false.  If it does, it better be a huge economic collapse because that's the only way you'd go back to traditional values because those traditional values would have value once again.  I think we'd even go before traditional values to barbaric where one big gorilla has the harem of 20 female gorillas and kills all the other male gorillas.  You see that happening now.  You saw it happening 10 years ago where women will sell their bodies because that is the number one commodity in the world.  But if it's just an economic slowdown, even if it's a big recession, no.  As long as that government's printing off checks, they truly don't need men.  That's the whole point I did with those two other videos.  Women technically don't need men.  And my current line of thought and theorizing is, do women even want men, in many instances and cases.  But that's up for debate.  All right, that's it.  Questions, answers, links down below.  We'll see you guys later.  Toodles. ",
