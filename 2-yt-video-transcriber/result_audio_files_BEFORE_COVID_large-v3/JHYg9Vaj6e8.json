            "text": "Okay.  At this point, I'm going to throw a quick comment in here so that you guys will understand what's going on.  Um, these DEA agents that are following me are being very aggressive.  They're being, you know, right out in the open.  Um, they're, they're basically trying to intimidate or scare me, get me to do something stupid.  Um, frequently after photographing a building, I'm followed.  Um, you know, when they, they stand off at a distance and just watch you and try to follow you.  That's one thing.  Um, I don't worry about that too much.  If, if by chance they happen to follow me back to my vehicle, uh, they're just going to get the vehicle information and then they're done.  But when they're openly following you and being aggressive like this, The reality is that if you get back to your vehicle, they are very likely going to have you stopped.  And when you're stopped under those circumstances, the probability of drugs being planted on you or something stupid like that is very high.  So I don't tolerate it.  What I did at this point is I called the DEA office and I told them, that they need to quit following me.  And I told them if they didn't, I would return to the DEA office, photograph every person, license plate, yada, yada, yada, and that I would publish it.  And I would do that until they decided that they wouldn't follow me anymore.  I went back and here's the video for that.  So then, a Cameron County Deputy Sheriff comes out to talk to me.  He doesn't appear in this video because he works undercover.  He came out and he told me that he would ensure, you know, he asked me what was going on and I told him.  And he said that he would ensure that I was not followed.  He kept his word and... So he does not appear in the video, nor do any more agents after that point.  Everything that you're seeing occurred prior to my conversation with that deputy.  And I told those people I was going to publish it.  And that is why it's published.  I generally don't do that.  But, you know, when they ask for it, you know, because that's what the guy on the phone said.  He said, I don't care what you do.  So, all right, there it is. ",
