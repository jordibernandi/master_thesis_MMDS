If you don't know how to read biblical poetry, if you don't know the formal qualities of parallelism and expansion, you are missing out on one-third of the Hebrew Bible.  Whatever theological background you have, you're going to have your own hypothesis, that is to say, your own plot and narrative.  What the literary reading allows you to do is to find new details that work within that overall plot or narrative.

He'd have to be something outside that thing.  to be the source of it. ",
