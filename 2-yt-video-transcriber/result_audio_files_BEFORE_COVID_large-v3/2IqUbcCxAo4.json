Now, if Donald Trump gets his way, then he will make sure that what he passes on to his children will be taxed at a substantially lower rate than it would be now.  So she's someone who is inheriting wealth that she obviously did not earn.  You didn't earn it if you're simply born into wealth.  However, when it comes to whether or not the peasants should be allowed to get something that they didn't earn... This is what Ivanka Trump, an oligarch who's an heiress, has to say about them getting something that they didn't earn. ",

People want to work for what they get.  So I think this idea of a guaranteed minimum is not something most people want.  They want the ability to be able to secure a job.  They want the ability to live in a country where there's the potential for upward mobility. ",

            "text": "And that right there ladies and gentlemen is all the proof you need that we do not live in a meritocracy.  I can earn or I can inherit money without earning it, and that's fine.  But when it comes to the peasants, no, they want to work until they die.  I mean, I've never seen anyone more out of touch than this right here.  Quote, I don't think most Americans in their heart want to be given something.  People want to work for what they get.  So if that's true, does it also apply to you?  Will you refuse to accept the money that your father will inevitably pass down to you?  Didn't think so.  And furthermore, what qualifies you to have that cushy job in the White House?  You have no qualifications.  You have a clothing company that's only successful because your dad pumped millions of dollars into it.  And your dad is only successful because your dad inherited the money that ultimately was stolen from the American people due to a complex tax avoidance scheme that was recently exposed by the New York Times.  So of all people in the world, Ivanka Trump is the person I want to hear the least from because you are so far detached from reality.  You have no idea what the peasants experience and what their day-to-day life is like.  You have no idea what living paycheck to paycheck is like.  In fact, let me ask you this, Ivanka Trump.  How much does a banana cost?  Can you answer that question?  Have you been in a grocery store recently or do you just have your handlers shop for you?  I mean, it's absurd.  And you have to understand here the ignorance and the contradiction at the same time.  Because on one hand, she says, oh, I don't think Americans want a guaranteed minimum, but they do want upward mobility.  Well, genius, you can't really have a chance at upward mobility unless you have a guaranteed minimum.  If you don't create a floor or a social safety net and you allow American citizens to fall below that, then they have no chance at upward mobility.  If you can't afford college, you can't get hired at a job that requires a college degree.  If you don't have access to clean drinking water, you can't be healthy enough to work hard enough to even have a chance at upward mobility.  So forgive me for not caring about what you have to say with regard to this specific issue.  Americans did earn the things that you're calling free.  Our tax dollars pay for these things.  And if you actually talk to the American people and not just sycophants of your dad, then you'll see that Americans do want Medicare for all.  Americans do want to increase the minimum wage.  Americans do want to save and protect Social Security.  Americans do want a federal jobs guarantee.  Americans do want the wealthy, such as yourself, to pay higher taxes.  But of course, she wouldn't know what real Americans think because she's not a real American.  She is an oligarch who is detached from the struggle of the everyday man and the everyday woman.  She has no idea.  She is clueless.  Now, she was asked a different question.  She was asked about her dad's plans for 2020 and she demonstrated, once again, just how out of touch she is. ",

            "text": "what they don't realize, what Republicans are failing to see is that you can't gaslight people about something that they have firsthand experience in dealing with.  They're trying to do this with health care.  Oh, well, you're going to lose your private insurance if we switch over to Medicare for all.  Do you understand that people hate private insurance?  They hate filling out the paperwork.  They hate paying their monthly premium that always increases and then finding out They have to pay more copays and deductibles when they actually want to see a doctor on top of paying their monthly premium.  Do you understand that that doesn't work with us if we know what's happening?  So she says, oh, well, you know, people are going to see for themselves how they're doing.  Except the problem is that people are seeing how your father's tax law is negatively affecting them.  Because they're seeing not only that they're getting lower refunds due to less deductions, but they're realizing that they owe money when they theoretically shouldn't have to owe money and didn't before.  And all of this is attributed directly to your dad's decision to cut his own taxes and shift that burden onto the working class.  Have fun explaining that to the American people.  This is what happens when you live in a bubble and you surround yourself with the yes men and yes women.  Every idea you have, regardless of how dumb it may be, well, they're gonna tell you that it's brilliant.  It's the most genius thing that they ever heard in their entire lives.  But in actuality, you need to be exposed to people who will push back.  But if you're in a bubble, you just don't have that, which is why we're seeing Donald Trump melt down by any criticism that's lobbed against him.  He can't take it because if you live your entire life surrounded by yes men and yes women and people who affirm every stupid thought that you have, then this is the result.  And Ivanka Trump will be the same exact way.  She's in for a wake-up call when she actually does talk to normal Americans and not just supporters of her dad because Americans don't agree with you, Ivanka.  Now, Since she attacked AOC's policies, AOC did what she does best.  She ripped Ivanka Trump, and she took to Twitter to state, As a person who actually worked for tips and hourly wages in my life, instead of having to learn about it secondhand, I can tell you that most people want to be paid enough to live.  A living wage isn't a gift, it's a right.  Workers are often paid far less than the value they create.  In fact, Wages are so low today compared to actual worker productivity that they are no longer the reflections of worker value as they used to be.  Productivity has grown 6.2 times more than pay.  And my favorite response is this from AOC.  Imagine attacking a jobs guarantee by saying people prefer to earn money.  That's exactly it.  Because she is trying to explain something like a jobs guarantee as a handout when people are begging to work.  They're saying, no, I want to be guaranteed a job so I can work.  So by definition, it's not a handout.  But if you live in a bubble and if you're an heiress who lives the life of a modern princess... then of course you wouldn't know that.  So forgive me, Ivanka Trump, for never wanting to hear a princess explain to us or really rich-splain to us what it is that we want.  You have no idea what we want.  You are detached from the struggle of everyday Americans.  And not only are you unqualified to serve in the White House in any capacity, as is the case with your dad, but you're unqualified to talk about issues that affect the American people.  Because you don't know what affects the American people.  Because you were born into wealth, you've never had to work a real job for even a day in your life, and you don't know what it's like to live paycheck to paycheck.  So sit down, have a seat, and actually step aside for progressives to come in and fix the economy that you and your Republican dad are helping to ruin even further. ",
