            "text": "Hey there!  It's Z from transvoicelessons.com and in this video we'll be learning all about the larynx.  We'll be discussing it in several parts.  First, basic knowledge, then we'll be listening to it, then I will walk you through it and I'll teach you how to raise your larynx.  We'll go over common issues and then we'll start to wrap up, okay?  I strongly recommend watching the previous Art of Voice Feminization video if you haven't.  It will be a very important primer to this process.  And so, yes, without further ado, let's get started.  The larynx is a muscular mucosal chamber.  in which your vocal folds reside in.  The position of the larynx can be altered through various muscle groups.  When the larynx is raised, the vocal folds are positioned closer to the lips, which shrinks the overall length of the vocal tract, which makes it sound a lot brighter and more feminine.  when the larynx lowers the vocal tract extends and the resonances shift a lot lower and so it sounds a lot more masculine and dark.  okay let's go ahead and listen to some examples of larynx alteration.  um okay so this is like with absolutely nothing going on.  It's a little hard for me to maintain, but this is with nothing. ",

I'm gonna start here, and then I'm just going to slowly start to raise the larynx until I'm all the way up here.  And you can hear that when I raise the larynx, the sound gets a lot brighter.  It sounds a lot brassier, kind of more metallic and sort of crisper.  Now I'm gonna speak and I'll shift from low to high, low to high. ",

            "text": "So first off, you have to understand something before we get into this.  And that is every single sound that ever enters your vocal tract gets influenced by your resonance.  It doesn't matter what it is.  Mechanical toothbrush.  If it's noise.  anything that goes in there sound wise gets affected by your resonance.  And that is absolutely true of your breath.  Okay.  So the breath is the easiest way for you to learn how to alter your larynx height, breath or noise, which I would recommend.  So first off, I just want you to mimic me and listen very carefully and do what I do.  Okay.  Okay.  Your turn.  Okay.  Good.  And now try and do this.  Okay.  Did you manage to get that?  I'll do it again.  You can hear it.  kind of sounds like I'm saying ha, right?  That's what you want it to say.  You don't want it to be he or he or none of that.  It must be work up slowly.  okay now what you're hearing there is your actual resonance.  okay because your air is just a flat noise signal and when it gets passed through your resonant chamber you can hear the sound of the chamber better than you can when you're actually producing a pitch.  okay so i want you to try this again.  you know think like a vampire sound like this.  okay That is actually optimal resonance for what you're trying to do.  At least stuff back here.  We can still control and influence a lot with the front of our mouth, but this is controlling the back of the mouth, okay?  And the larynx and the back of the tongue.  So I'll give it to you again.  Okay?  Try that a few times and rewind if you need to.  After you have done that, if you successfully feel like you've got that correct sound, seamlessly turn that air into a singing note like so okay so i'll do the whole thing from the beginning.  heat from fire fire from heat and that's what my voice sounded like if i used that particular resonance that i was testing.  okay now there's a reason why we do this for the overwhelming majority of people i've worked with.  if they try and jump straight to talking after they've raised their larynx they will just immediately drop their larynx and get no effect.  so what we are doing?  First, we use the air sound to hear exactly what our resonance is doing.  Then we take that resonant shape and we simply turn it into a note that we're comfortable with so that we make sure that we're creating sound with the proper resonance.  Then you can try and talk.  So in full, the exercise would look like this.  Ha!  Heat from fire, fire from heat.  Okay?  Good!  Give it a shot and rewind if you need any clarification on this.  And you know, there's lots of variations that you can do with this.  Experiment with your larynx using external noise.  You can take brown noise or white noise, play it on a phone, put it up to your mouth.  Uh, ee, uh, eh, eh, eh.  And you can practice your resonance that way.  In fact, I would argue that that is by far the best way to do it.  So do that if you'd like.  And you can also do that fluid version with your breath too, like so.  Ha!  Heat from fire, fire from heat.  Okay?  Some people find that easy.  Some people find the step easy.  Some people find the noise easier.  You should try all of these and see if one of them sticks for you.  Okay?  Now, after you do that, you'll want to make sure that you avoid a few common issues.  Okay, so the number one common issue is flipping into falsetto when they go to sing the note.  And that would sound like this.  and it doesn't quite sound right, don't go into your falsetto.  I recommend starting with a comfortable pitch for you, not something crazy high.  Typically, I would say anywhere between 160 to 250 hertz when you're doing this exercise.  Otherwise, you can just pick something that feels comfortable for you.  Make sure that you avoid your falsetto.  Two, uh... A lot of people will alter the resonance with their tongue instead of the larynx.  Anytime that you change anything in the vocal tract, it will actually change your resonance.  And so what a lot of people do is they go and they try and do this exercise and their tongue starts coming forward and starts changing that.  So it'll sound like this if that occurs.  And you can hear that it sounds higher.  It sounds like your resonance has gotten brighter because the oral cavity resonance has, but that's not targeting the larynx, which is the goal of this exercise, okay?  So you wanna make sure that you don't go, or h-h-h, or h-h-h, or e-e.  No hes, no hees, none of that.  Try and keep it ha.  That actually ensures that the tongue is in a somewhat neutral position, which is allowing all of the change to come from the back of the tongue and the larynx.  Okay?  Good.  The third most common issue is raising the larynx too high and getting a very choked or fluttery sound.  It sounds like this if you do it.  like that, right?  What that is is the back of your tongue lifted so high that it's actually sort of bouncing against the top of the palate or the back of the throat, either one, and it's sort of opening and closing, creating this sort of frictiony, fluttery sound.  If you hear that, that indicates that you're actually too high with your larynx and you'll wanna go lower, okay?  Just a little lower than that area there.  Fourth most common issue is tensing the neck muscles instead of allowing the correct muscles to perform the motion.  I see this pretty often.  Some people, they think it's in their neck.  Believe it or not, even though we're raising the larynx, it's not really like a neck phenomenon.  It's much more like a tongue phenomenon.  Make sure your neck's not tense.  In fact, if you look at mine, it barely does anything.  There's no extra muscles.  There's no extra tension.  That's it, okay?  So make sure you don't have that.  The fifth most common issue is squeezing the vocal folds too hard.  Some people, when they go to do this, they have all this vocal fold closure and it sounds like this.  Right?  Like they're like fighting or straining.  We don't want that.  We want to stay very calm, very relaxed, no choking off the sound, okay?  Good.  The sixth most common issue when people try to raise their larynx using these techniques is they don't listen, okay?  Listening is the single most important thing you can do in this entire process.  You literally have to use your ears critically.  You have to think very critically and ask yourself, what am I hearing?  Am I creating that?  How is it different?  How can it be closer?  Let your ears guide you and really listen, okay?  But the key to this process isn't how it feels.  It's not what muscles you're using.  It's what it sounds like.  It's using your ears.  And this is something a lot of people don't seem to quite understand.  Sound is literally a picture, okay?  When you hear someone's voice or when you hear a vowel or when you hear a sound, you are literally hearing a blueprint, a guide and a diagram of what the inside of that person's body looks like, okay?  So if you're trying to learn to feminize your voice and you're trying to do these exercises, maybe it will help you to think about muscles.  Maybe it might help you to think about feelings, but I guarantee it will help you if you use your ear and you really listen and ask yourself, what does this sound like?  How different is this?  How am I different?  What's different about mine?  And you really start to get critical with your ears, okay?  The ears should be the guide for the voice.  In conclusion, the larynx is a chamber which contains your vocal folds.  The height of this area and the sort of proximity of it can be altered.  When the larynx is lifted upwards, it brightens the sound, making you sound more feminine.  And when the larynx moves downwards, it darkens the sound, making you sound more masculine.  Review the exercises given in this video and listen very carefully to the samples.  I want you to experiment with all of the different techniques and let me know if this works for you or if you have any issues.  There is honestly so much more to know and explore and to fully digest, but I wanted to keep this video somewhat simple, clear, and easy to follow.
