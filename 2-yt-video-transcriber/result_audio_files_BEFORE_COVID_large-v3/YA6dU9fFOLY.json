            "text": "Ah yes, science has done it again, boys and girls.  In case you've been living under a rock for the past week or so, there's been an image that came out of a supermassive black hole.  Not a fake simulated image, mind you.  The black hole is that of a nearby galaxy called Messier 87.  And when I say nearby, that's 53 million light years away.  Wow, I can already imagine the minds of flat earthers being blown away.  What do you mean 53 million light years away?  That's literally impossible!  Yeah, so massive shout out to all the scientists that worked on this project.  In a world where stupid people are extremely loud about going against science, we should take more time in appreciating the accomplishments of scientists.  Anyway, of course, when something like this makes the news, flat earthers wouldn't be able to sit still.  I doubt they even know what a black hole is.  But nonetheless, you see videos on YouTube such as this flat earther who made a fake black hole image in Photoshop, claiming how easy it is to fake an image like this.  Well, I've already seen the image so I know the one on the left is fake, but come on, that doesn't even look that similar to the actual image.  In yours, you can kind of see some layers of circles there, which wouldn't exist in an actual image.  That's some lazy photoshopping, I'm disappointed.  In the rest of the video, he shows us how he created the fake image.  I sped it up here so you don't get bored, because I sure did.  He draws some circles and blurs it basically, nothing too creative or anything.  Yeah, because you sure have evidence that all the images and footage NASA gives are fake.  Even back in 1969 when faking footage of the moon was basically impossible with current technology.  Apparently, NASA employs time travelers.  Moving on, here is a flat earther named Jake who narrates his thoughts over a news broadcast of the black hole image.  I hope I don't get a copyright strike for showing this footage. ",

Scientists calculated and predicted the existence of black holes a very long time ago, and the simulated images and footage were to hypothetically show what it would look like if we were able to see it.  Due to black holes absorbing everything that comes close to it, it doesn't emit light, so direct observation is impossible.  But what you are able to see is the light that bends around the black hole, emitted by the surrounding matter.  That gives us resulting black hole simulation images like this one.  But it wasn't until last week that an actual black hole was imaged.  And in case you're wondering why it's so blurry, that's because the black hole is so far away, about 55 million light years.  Look, if NASA and every other space agencies in the world were truly lying to us, why would they claim the previous images of black holes were simulations?  Why not just say they're all real?  That surely would be better at getting a lot of people to believe the existence of black holes. ",

These telescopes measured specifically radio waves because they provided the best resolution for imaging.

The radio waves were captured and then put into a computer to be compiled together into the image we saw in the news.

Only the radiation from the matter around it can be seen, so it's not really a shadow.  That's just something scientists say to help people vaguely understand why it looks the way it looks.  The radius of the shadow is about 2.6 times the radius of the event horizon.  That's when light isn't absorbed by the black hole and is able to reach our eyes, so areas past that is able to be observed.  That's the ring around the black hole.  So we can't actually see the black hole, nor can we see its event horizon, but rather we see an area that is a decent distance around the event horizon, 2.6 times the radius.  I don't expect flat earthers to understand what I just said, so let's just move on.
