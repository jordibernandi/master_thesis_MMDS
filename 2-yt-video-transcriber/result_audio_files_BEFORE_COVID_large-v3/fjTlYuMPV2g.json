            "text": "I want to talk about the window of opportunity for romantic love or love between a man and a woman and how it differs.  that I don't think many actually have talked about.  You see, in women's love stories, they always find love again.  It's this peculiar, to me anyway, story of heartbreak intensity of the one and only true love.  and then recycling it and finding another person who is the same thing and again and again.  And I don't know if it's a built-in thing with women because they're used to this rebirth cycle, monthly giving birth.  There's always a renewal, a constant rebirth.  Whereas I think with men, it's like a linear thing where where we're cognizant of the past, learning from it where we are and the next steps we'll take forward.  So there's not this kind of amnesia of what just happened and then we're reborn again.  It's watching our next step.  It's never forgetting You know, not staying in the past, but moving forward with the lessons learnt.  Men don't have this optimistic, romantic recycling from zero.  This amnesia of what happened to them, like women might.  And we can speculate why.  And I'd be interested in your comments in the comments section.  But men don't have this.  And recently in the comments, I've had comments from females which I can appreciate where it comes from.  I'm not pissed off about it, but it gets frustrating where they only see it from their perspective, which isn't surprising, but... why they can't take the straight answer from men if they can articulate it.  For instance, the typical thing women will say when you no longer are romantically interested in women, at best you're a romantic realist if you do want to get with women.  So for instance, myself, I'm not that hormonally driven, storybook optimistic person that I was in my 20s and hormonal teens.  But when women often try and shame you with, just because you've been hurt by some woman in the past, don't tarnish all women going forward with the same brush.  Now, I think a lot of women think, you know, notwithstanding the guys that clearly are angry.  The guys clearly do have a chip on their shoulder.  They really want the dream and they're frustrated that they can't get it or it's too dangerous to even try today.  Notwithstanding those guys, which is legitimate, and I understand why they feel that way.  It is dangerous out there.  There is so much risk that any sensible man would say, like, not interested, even though I deeply want it.  I'm not interested.  But most of the time, what is frustrating with women, especially midlife, my age, they automatically think that I have the same interest in them that I did when I was in my 20s and in my teens.  And I try to explain to them Try to give them the picture that I don't hate them.  I'm not angry.  I've passed that point in my time.  There's a change in seasons with a guy that, romantically speaking with a woman, it's always recycled.  It never leaves.  It's a perpetual recycling of that moment.  And again, I don't know, like I said, is it because of their use to the rebirth all the time?  Renew, the optimistic renewal.  But with men, we're very seasonal in a linear fashion.  Men go through their lives, if you want to explain it to women when they put you on the spot like this, is spring is youth.  Summer is hormonal teens and 20s.  when we're driven biologically to get together with that sort of youthful high where a man's romantic and sexual drive to be with a woman, you feel euphoric, it's drug-like.  Being with a woman feels like Pepsi on ice.  But later on, the season changes.  It moves to autumn, midlife, where I am moving on to my winter, past 50.  I'm approaching that.  The feeling is very different.  It's looking on the past of romanticism and moving forward and just seeing how I want to live comfortably and calmly and happily and contently.  And it's hard to explain this to women who just think I've been hurt by somebody in my past.  No, I've had that moment.  And the way I explain it to women is, in the way that they can understand, is, let me put it in this way, ladies.  It's in a similar fashion to the way that women will want to have children, that intense experience, and fulfill that part of their lives.  But once they've had children, it's quite understandable.  in their mid-lives, they've passed that point.  They've moved to another stage of their lives.  They no longer want children.  They're glad to have had it, and they've had that experience, but they've moved on to something else.  It's a similar thing with men, where romantically, either we've had that love, or two if we're lucky, We've had that intense experience.  And doubly so, men don't want it and have little interest in it anymore.  if they've had it ripped from them, their children ripped from them, their love ripped from them, that person that they gave everything to ripped from them.  And so they leave that in the past and they move forward.  They don't hate women.  It's just they don't have any interest in it.  Some of them painfully so.  But like with myself, you know, I wanted that thing, not children.  But I wanted that experience as a male to connect with a woman intensely when I was in my summer period in my life, when I wanted to connect with a woman.  you know, biologically really intensely.  It was the first and only priority in my life.  And now it's this sort of low-level interest, companionship at best, you know, wanting just to live a good life with me at the center and everything in my life, people, things, pastimes, routines, complement how I want to live.  Yeah, no longer do men, when they pass from that summer period to the autumn period in their 30s and 40s, no longer do they try and live through a female, through biology.  Their focus moves to the world and meaning and how they like to live the remainder of their life.  Because now you're quite aware that... most of your life is behind you and there's less in front of you and so you're less hormonally driven.  your testosterone's dropped significantly which helps alleviate acting like a dog in front of women.  so yeah i would offer this to you gentlemen and convey it to women if you're ever put on the spot by them you know being told that just because you've been hurt in the past by a woman or a woman's treated you badly there's no reason not to hold the optimism moving forward.  It's that, no, it's not that.  I'm not angry.  I'm not scared.  I've had that moment in my life, just like women have had their moment of having children.  They've passed that moment, that Archimedean point of intensity.  of the time in your life when it was right and biologically driven to do so.  You do it, you feel it quite naturally and then later on it dissipates.  There's only so much romantic fuel in a man's tank and it burns hot, fast and really intensely in his 20s and teens and it dissipates very quickly.  There's just no more fuel in the tank left.  Men would still like to be with women, like I still do, But they're like a horizontal friendship.  I want to share moments with my life with friends and people I care about and my pastimes and get the most out of it.  I don't want to just jump down one narrow cliff anymore because life is too short.  I'm very, very aware.  Life has snapped into focus in terms of my boundaries and how I value life.  experiencing life until the grave.  Intense romantic love for a woman is just a window for a man in his 20s.  I think it's reflective also of women's reproductive window too.  I think there's a correlation between the two.  And once that point is crossed, Men move to a different stage of life.  Life moves on.  Another season is to be lived, so to speak, moving forward.  So yeah, I'd offer that analogy, that intense romantic love and fixation on a woman for a man is similar to that period in life where a woman wants a child.  And when either of us has experienced that thing, when women have experienced children or men have experienced intense love or feeling for women, and then he gets nothing from it or that point in time has passed, one moves to a different thing in life.  One no longer has the interest in recycling youth.  Anyway, something to think about.  And I'll talk to you later.
