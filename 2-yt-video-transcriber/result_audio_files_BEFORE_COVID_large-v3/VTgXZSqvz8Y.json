            "text": "What's up, everybody?  I hope you've seen my other video.  I'll put a little card up here for it, but I just recently started following the MGTOW lifestyle.  I realized that it was the right decision for me, and I wanted to share a little story with you guys about something that happened here over the weekend.  I run my own business online, and I'm actually gonna put a link to my business here in this video on eBay, so you can go take a look, see if there's anything that you like.  I do a lot of cool men's clothing and things like that, but anyways.  I also do lift on the side as a little bit of extra money to help me pay off some credit cards and take care of some of my life since I am now focusing on me and not other people.  I had a job that took me to a part of town that I don't get to very often.  I have a buddy that lives there that I used to work with.  We worked side by side for a little over two years.  I haven't seen him in a while, and I've heard recently some rumors that he has come out as being gay.  He hasn't talked to me about it yet, and I'm happy if it's true because we all knew.  I mean, let's just face it.  We all knew.  And he was just lying to everybody, and you could tell he wasn't happy.  So it was important that he did this, and I was hoping that one day he would talk to me about it because, like I said, we worked together for two years straight.  We're like family.  I mean, we've shared a lot of information, but I guess I'm not close enough for that story yet.  so I hit him up.  sure enough he's out and about he's having some drinks and he says hey man come meet up with me let's let's talk.  I'm like perfect.  so I go and I meet up with him and and we had a very positive conversation.  he did you know talk to me about his decisions in life which is awesome and he was so happy.  I mean it was so cool to see him just enjoying his life and enjoying himself and being at one with himself.  so I the conversation, you know, we, we were just having a good back and forth.  We were talking to him.  We started catching up on the past and he was letting me know about some stuff with his family that was going on.  And, uh, and his grandma just passed recently, things of that nature.  And it was all, you know, we, we had some good conversations.  So, but he's there with a friend of his who I've met before.  She's a bartender friend of his.  And I have a thing, man, there, there's a few classes that I don't, I don't come behind.  I don't, I don't follow.  Uh, one of them's bartenders hairdressers and chicks with sport bikes something about them all.  i just i don't like the way that they typically carry themselves.  they usually uh they're so used to having uh guys just on them non-stop that they just don't know they're not themselves.  so anyways uh this girl instantly was on me i mean on me and and i could just tell right away you know she's giving me the jimmy eyes the jimmy eyes never lie.  and and i could just tell something was going on there.  and then of course my my gay buddy starts giving me the you two should.  i'm like You know, I told him, I said, look, man, unfortunately right now, I'm just not looking for anything like that.  I made a decision to stay celibate.  I don't want nothing to do with a woman.  I'm focusing on me, my business, my children.  And I mean, that was like game on, right?  Like as soon as I said that to her, it was like, I got to try to win this one over.  So she wasn't trying like super, super hard, but she was definitely kept, you know, staying interested.  And she was pushing him to go to this other bar.  And, and I, you know, I don't know why she was pushing so hard, but then I figured out because eventually I said, look, man, I'll just go with you.  Like I got nothing going on.  I can come over and hang out with you at the other places right down the street.  And when we get there, She had, there was this guy that she knows that's gay that was there that she was hooking my buddy up with, right?  So, cool, whatever.  But now I'm there to talk to my buddy and have a conversation with him.  And now I get kind of pushed into this almost like a double date vibe, right?  Because he's hanging out with this dude trying to, you know, spit game to this dude.  And I'm now sitting here with this friend of his that's trying to spit game to me.  And... I let her know straight up what was going on, and I told her where I'm at in life and what I'm feeling about.  I even tried to get a little bit personal with some details that would maybe kind of scare her away a little bit, and none of it worked.  It was like no matter what I said and no matter how hard I pushed her away, the basement just kept flooding, man, and she was just on it.  She was so on it.  you know we're talking back and forth and she starts giving me a little bit more information about her background and i mean unfortunately like it just kept getting worse and worse.  you know she just had a kid with this dude that she lived with and then she was married to she.  they broke apart they were on their own but then they got back together again and for some god-awful reason decided to buy a house which was all in her name with her money.  but she put his name on it like just crazy situation.  right dude's a nut wouldn't leave her alone.  now she has a pfa against them.  uh just it was like one thing after another after another which made me just think like thank god like those are the types of things that sometimes you don't learn right away right sometimes when you meet these chicks and they start talking to you and they don't.  they don't normally open up with that type of information they usually open up with a lot more.  you know positive style of their lives.  they don't really talk about the negative part of their lives.  so um The conversation went on for a while.  My buddy was still, you know, trying to talk to this dude, whatever, doing his thing.  And this chick just kept going and going and going on me.  And I was just being cool and having, like, I thought what I would consider just a friendly, positive conversation about life and, you know, some of the things that are going on and why I decided to do what I'm doing.  We talked about my business a little bit, you know, just good conversations overall.  Um, but at the end of it, she just kind of was kind of pushing for my number.  My buddy kept pushing for me to give her my number.  And, um, so I did just to kind of, you know, make the situation not super awkward, but I haven't talked to her since she hasn't talked to me either, which is kind of cool that she hasn't been, you know, trying to, to, to come after me so hard.  So, and I think that she's a little, you know, I, I set that ground of what I was doing and I didn't really want it.  you know anything serious which is funny because you know what they do.  as soon as you start hitting them with that.  right as soon as you start hitting them with the i don't want nothing serious like.  you're just real with them right you're real and you're straight up front.  it's amazing how they start hitting you with other avenue.  well i don't want that either.  i don't want something serious either.  well you know i'm just looking for a friend or whatever And then she starts to get into, well, you know, I've always thought about the friends with benefits situation.  Like, I've never really done that.  I could maybe do a friends with benefits.  Guys, don't.  Do not.  Do not fall victim to the friends with benefits excuse.  Women don't have friends with benefits.  Very, very, very few women can separate the emotions from sex.  Very few can.  Most of them cannot.  And they might be able to do it for a little bit of time.  And they might be able to tell you, sorry, I got something in my eye that keeps bothering my eyelash.  They'll be able to do it for a very short period of time.  They'll be able to maintain that face for a little bit, but eventually they fall in love, man.  They always fall in love.  And that's whenever it gets really hard because now this whole situation is just a mess and you always end up being the asshole.  right?  I mean, that's just the way it goes.  You always end up being the one who's treating her like shit.  Who's making the bad decisions.  Who's taking advantage of her.  Who's all this stuff, right?  Even though no matter how upfront you can be and telling them the truth up front, you're always the one that's going to be in fault at fault at the end.  So, uh, I, for a brief moment, I found myself thinking like, you know, I do kind of like this chick.  Like she's kind of cool and she's good looking girl.  She got a great body on her.  Um, but you got to look at the big picture, right?  You got to look at the big picture and you got to really see what they're bringing versus what you're bringing.  And I mean, I got a little bit of baggage too.  I've got an ex-wife and stuff.  I got a couple of kids, so I get that.  But, uh, I keep my baggage in check.  You know, my ex-wife isn't nuts.  She's not going to, I don't have a PFA against her, right?  She's not bothering me all the time.  My kids are, you know, grown.  I mean, I got teenage kids that can take care of themselves.  She had like a five-year-old.  I don't have, I don't know.  I already did all that.  You know what I mean?  It was funny because it was a definite test of me of how strong I could be as far as my decision making because unfortunately, a lot of times it comes down to getting laid.  Getting laid becomes the deciding factor, so we're so thinking and desperate to get laid.  Here's the deal for me.  I haven't had sex in, I don't even know, well over a year, probably a year and a half to two years, somewhere in that range.  could I easily?  Yeah, I can go get laid anytime I want.  It's not hard to go pick up a chick.  And nowadays chicks will, they, you know, they'll let you do whatever you want.  I mean, that's, that's their way of getting your attention is just to let you have sex.  It's normal.  I mean, hell, if I really wanted to, I just go pay for it.  I mean, let's be honest.  That's the easiest way to do it.  Right?  No strings attached at the end of it.  Uh, but, Once you can get past that point and once you can start realizing that there's so much more involved in getting laid than just getting laid, unless you're paying for it, there's a ton of strings attached.  Once you can get past all that, you can stop looking at the sexual side of it and you start seeing all the other stuff, right?  So once you look past the looks, because looks go away, looks come and go.  Once you look past any money, you know, she was, she pulled out, oh, all I have is hundreds.  And she pulled out like $300 bills to pay her tab at the bar, right?  Money don't mean shit, right?  Money comes and goes.  time is gone.  once you use time you don't get it back.  so the time that you waste in these relationships and the time that you waste uh trying to make somebody else happy you're never going to get that back and you're never going to be able to to focus that on yourself at all or your own.  you know children or your own family.  you know.  i look at it this way.  i gave it a shot i got married i i i thought it was a one and done type of a deal and i clearly i was wrong i was misled.  um I mean, hell, I used to always think that way because of my parents and my parents are together forever and all that stuff.  But now my mom's been treating my dad like shit.  She's never worked a day in her life.  My dad has done nothing but do good things for my mother.  And she's just shitting on him right now.  And he's about to retire and he's scared shitless of it.  He don't want to retire.  He don't want to be stuck with that woman every day who treats him like crap and puts him down and doesn't let him have any friends and always tries to make fun of any friends he has and puts him down for that, puts him down for the hobbies that he does.  I mean, it's insane.  It's insane to think that my dad has spent so many years with this woman and here he is ready to retire and enjoy his final side of his life and he's got to do it with a woman he can't stand.  or now he's got to go through and get divorce raped and have her because she ain't never worked a day in her life.  So if they end up splitting, she's going to take it.  And you know what?  He's going to be happy to pay it.  Because sometimes you just got to pay a couple bucks to make a problem go away.  My way of looking at it is I just avoid the problems.  I hope that that little story was a little bit of an inspiration.  Give me a subscribe.  Give me a like.  Give me some comments, man.  Let me know about some crazy stuff that these women have done to you to try to get your attention and try to get you to stop what you want to do in life and start trying to do what they want in life.  And then go check out, I'm posting up a video right now about this crazy girl that runs this dude's life.  Go watch that too because if you're looking for a laugh, you're going to get one.  I love you guys.  Keep up the MGTOW.  Be strong.  Don't let these ladies tell you what to do or try to slide into your life and try to lie to you and tell you, oh yeah, I don't want a relationship either and oh yeah, I'm friends with benefits and all.  Don't give in to it, man, because they will say whatever it takes.  Whatever it takes to get you to take care of them.  MGTOW for life.  Later. ",
