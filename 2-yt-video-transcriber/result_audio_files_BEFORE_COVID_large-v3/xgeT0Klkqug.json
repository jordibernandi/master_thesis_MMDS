            "text": "This is the Dollamore Daily, and I'm Jesse Dollamore.  So I want to begin this series on why I left the Republican Party with the phrase that you commonly hear from people who choose to no longer be affiliated with the GOP.  And that is, I didn't leave the Republican Party, the Republican Party left me.  And this is something I've probably myself said a time or two.  But upon deeper reflection, I don't believe it to be accurate.  Unless, of course, you're talking to someone who was a Republican during or shortly after the Lincoln administration.  Because the Republican Party has long been a pernicious political party that has taken advantage of the racial animosities of whites in this country to keep themselves relevant.  In fact, there was a specific, deliberate tactic that was employed by the party and its strategists to gain a foothold in the Southern states and to ensure that Republicans started to win elections again.  I'm referring, of course, to the Southern strategy.  And educating myself about the specifics of the Southern strategy was one of the many reasons that led me to depart the Republican Party.  Most, if not all, Republicans claim that the Southern Strategy is a myth.  And that's because it outs them as the sinister, calculating party that they truly are.  It also is an attempt to give them cover and forever claim that the modern-day Democrat Party is the party of the KKK, while they are the party of Abraham Lincoln.  But let's face it, if I were to ask you to guess the political party affiliation of the people in these photos, I think it is clear that we aren't talking about people who voted for Barack Obama.  And that, in fact, the current white supremacy movement. ",
