            "text": "Well, the primary reason is I believe Christianity is true.  And the first evidence for that was seeing it living in my parents.  So I tested it from an early age.  I could see it was resilient.  It supported something.  The other reasons came pouring in later.  And the great thing about Christianity is that it is testable.  Jesus claims that if we trust him and repent of the mess we've made of our lives and others and trust him for salvation, we will receive peace with God.  I meet many people, they have no peace at all.  They'd love to get peace.  We will receive forgiveness.  how much anguish there is, even in this room, as a result of lack of forgiveness.  And when you see again and again and again, I put it this way often, you meet somebody, you don't know them, and you see they're in a terrible state, perhaps a student, suicidal, narcotic dependent, all this kind of thing, and you meet them six months later and they've got a smile on their face, and they're no longer dependent on narcotics, and you say, what's happened?  And they say something like this, well, I became a Christian, or I met Jesus, or I got converted, many ways of saying it.  When you see that, as I have done, endless times, you begin to mathematically add two and two and get four.  There's a connection between transformed lives and faith in Christ the Savior and Lord.  That is the hard test.  People often say to me, you're a scientist.  You believe in testing theories.  You can't test Christianity.  I say, that's absolute nonsense.  One of my main reasons for being Christian is that I've tested it, and it works.  And the proof of the pudding is always in the eating.  believing it theoretically.  Let me put it this way.  God is not a theory.  He's a person.  And when we're thinking about these things, there's a danger on the intellectual side, which is very important, that we're relating to a theory.  Do I believe this theory or not?  But we've got to rise above that.  This theory is important.  But Relating to a person has got many other dimensions than relating to a theory, and you'll know that if you're married and so on.  Persons are much more complex than theories.  And the thrilling thing is that having been made in the image of God, we are capable, through Christ, of having a real relationship with him.  And in the end, that is the supreme test. ",
