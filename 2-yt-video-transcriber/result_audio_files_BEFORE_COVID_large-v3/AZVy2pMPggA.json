So make sure that you click that notification bell to all so that you don't miss a beat and every single time I upload a video you will be first to know.  So with that being said, let's get into today's video.  Should Christians wear makeup?  Well, I think it's pretty evident from the look of this video how I feel about women and makeup.  You know, I love makeup and I don't have a problem with it.  Now, before I go any further, disclaimer, or before I receive any negative comments, I just want to say that this is strictly my opinion, you guys, and we're all entitled to our own opinion.  You know, you don't have to believe the same way I do.  But I'm giving you my opinion because that's exactly what you guys asked for on my channel.  So I'm letting you know where I stand with this.  If you don't agree with me, please refrain from any negative comments or anything like that because that's not what I'm here for.  I'm here to help you grow spiritually, emotionally, physically in every area of your life.  And, you know, this is just my opinion.  So it's going to be all right.  Why do I think that it's okay for women to wear makeup?  Christian women in particular to wear makeup.  I think number one, I believe that we serve a creative God and I believe that makeup is a very creative thing to do.  I love wearing makeup because naturally my DNA is a creative.  I am a creative in nature.  I love to create new looks with my makeup.  I love to get all dolled up.  Now, but I think it's very important with that being said, that you look at the condition of your heart, that you look at your motives.  Why are you doing what you do?  People look at the outward appearance of a man, but the Lord looks at the heart.  And so, you know, God knows your heart.  He knows exactly what's inside.  He knows why you do the things that you do.  So dig deep within yourself and ask yourself, why am I putting on makeup in the first place?  Is it to impress a guy?  Is it because I don't feel good enough?  Because those things are not what God has called you to do or feel like.  You know, God created you perfect in every way, shape, or form.  He loves you exactly the way that you are and He wants you to love yourself exactly because you are his pride and joy.  I think wearing makeup is a great way to express yourself.  It's a great way to express your femininity.  And God created me a very feminine female.  I'm a huge girly girl.  I love girly things, you know, and I have no problem with expressing myself in that way because that's my DNA.  That's who God created me to be.  So makeup in itself is not bad.  But if you're doing it for the wrong reasons and you're putting on makeup because, you know, and you have a problem, then that's where you really need to check your heart and see, why do I do the things that I do?  Now, true story, growing up in my household, my mom never left the house without lipstick on at least, you know, minimum lipstick.  She always got all dolled up.  It was modeled for me.  And she never taught me that it was wrong to do it or anything like that.  I never felt convicted about wearing makeup.  But if I'm being completely honest with you, if you ever catch me on a weekend, if you ever see me outside on a weekend at the store or something like that, running errands you're going to see me completely bare face.  I don't wear any makeup on weekends unless I'm going to an event or I'm going somewhere maybe to church.  you know I'm getting ready for something.  but if I'm just running my errands or getting you know going about my day I'm not wearing any makeup.  I don't have to have it I don't have to put it on every morning.  I don't wake up three hours before I have to get up just to put on my makeup.  You know, that is not me.  I am a 30 minute girl, max.  30 minute makeup time and that's it.  That's all you get.  But you know, it's just, we're all different.  I love what Proverbs 31, 31 says.  It says, charm is deceptive and beauty is fleeting, but a woman who fears the Lord shall be praised.  And when it's all said and done, I believe that God has called us to be free.  He's called us to be free, to freely express ourselves in every way that we want to.  As long as it's not, of course, an idol.  If you make makeup an idol, then... I don't think you should be putting it on in the first place.  But if you're just doing it because you want to express yourself, you want to be free, you know, who the sun sets free is free indeed.  That is what my Bible says.  So I don't think there's anything wrong with it.  You know, I believe that makeup can help a lot of women feel more comfortable in their own skin.  You know, I remember when I was a teenager and I struggled with acne problems, I would use makeup to cover up those blemishes, you know, so that I could feel, you know, confident in myself and I don't think that there's anything wrong with doing that.  I mean I know a lot of girls who do that and as long as you're using it for the right reasons and not the wrong reasons and not the wrong motives then I think it's okay.  I feel like the older I get the less I struggle with self-esteem issues.  you know the more comfortable I am in my own skin but it took me a long time to get there.  if I'm being completely honest you know didn't happen overnight.  I really had to dig deep into my word, find out what the word of God says about me, learn who I am in Christ, my identity in Christ, which is everything to me.  And then from there, you just do what you can and you grow and you learn and you grow.  Another thing I wanted to note is that when I wear makeup, I do believe that rule that less is more.  I don't wanna pound my face with too much makeup on.  I know I have been guilty of that sometimes, of wearing too much makeup, but that's only because of my career choice.  What I do for a living requires that I put on more makeup than the average girl.  I'm in front of all these lights, right now I'm looking at a bunch of lights that are around me that really wash out your face.  They make you look like a ghost.  So because of being in the TV industry, because of being a vlogger, sometimes I do have to wear more makeup than the normal girl.  Now does that mean that it happens all the time?  No, it doesn't happen all the time.  But this is the line of work that I chose and this is what I have to do in order to look presentable on camera.  So in conclusion, I just want to say that you are called to be free.  And if you want to express yourself with makeup, I don't think there's anything wrong with it unless, you know, you are making an idol out of makeup or you feel like you are not beautiful without it because that is not the case.  We know what the word of God says and the word of God says that you are fearfully and wonderfully made and he made you exactly the way he wanted you.  so I think that we can all learn from that and and really just respect each other's beliefs and respect if someone doesn't want to wear makeup because that is a conviction of theirs.  I've said it in other videos before but you know your convictions are your convictions and just because you believe something doesn't mean that somebody else has to believe it.  you know we're not here to judge anybody.  We're here to just shine light.  That's what we are called to do is to be the light that shines in the world.  So with that being said, thank you so much for watching Life with Donna Vlogs.
