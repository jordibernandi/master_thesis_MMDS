            "text": "Hi, my name is Dr.  Fuzz Rana.  I'm a biochemist and I'm joined by Dr.  Kenny Rhodes, who's a Christian scholar.  And we're going to take on a hard question that atheists ask Christians.  We both like to go online and engage people on Facebook and Twitter and in the YouTube environment.  And in that context, there's an interesting article on a website called 40 Questions for Christians.  And Dr.  Thomas Swan has collated these questions.  He's a PhD in experimental psychology.  And I think the implication is Christians are not able to answer these questions or are going to try to avoid these questions.  So we decided to take them on.  And so we're doing some episodes where we take on one question at a time.  And the question that we're going to take on today is this.  Can a mass murderer go to heaven for accepting your religion while a kind doctor goes to hell for not? ",

            "text": "That is probably one of the toughest questions that can be asked.  And I have heard that many times, talking about mass murderers who end up killing people and then go to jail and find the gospel.  And there's a number of things that I could say in response to that.  And I think the first one would simply be, it's not about our conduct or our good works that save us.  And I think that's very important because that's part of the gospel that I think sometimes is confused because of the legalism that tends to come along with the gospel and in churches.  And it seems as if if you do good, you're okay, you're in.  If you do bad... you're not.  And that's why Jesus is so far superior to any other religious figure, because it wasn't about just doing good.  It's about Jesus doing it all for you.  And then you in turn, just receiving that gift.  And so it's about who you know in that sense and who you're placing your trust in.  So it's not about conduct.  It's not about being good, but I still get the power of that question because it seems to be unfair if you're looking at it from a strictly conduct point of view.  So I can see that's tough. ",

            "text": "Right.  And I think too, and this is hard for people to accept, that really there's no difference between a kind doctor before God, a kind doctor who does all kinds of good things to save people's lives, and a mass murderer who commits horrific acts of evil, both in God's eyes are equivalent because they both are sinful.  They both have separated themselves because of their sin from a God who is holy, who cannot tolerate any iota of sin.  But yet God has made a way for both people to come into a relationship together.  with him and for their sins to be forgiven.  And so if both are willing to accept that offer, then both are viewed in the same way in God's eyes. ",

            "text": "Christianity is really a scandal to, as Scripture tells us, to the Greek and the Jew because the Jew was religious.  He thought that he could work himself and of course the gospel.  why would jesus have to die and why would god use that kind of mechanism to save humanity?  it really is a scandal to both the religious and the unreligious and so this whole idea that you can get in for free It insults human pride right at the core.  And so I think that's why people have struggles with this.  But I also want to add to this discussion that the idea that all of us are sinners in God's eyes.  That is exactly the case.  But that is not in any way to lessen the impact of what, say, a mass murderer and his sins can do to society.  And in that sense, the good doctor on Judgment Day is going to be in a better place than the mass murderer because there are degrees of punishment in hell as well as degrees of reward in heaven.  So when we understand that God, yes, all of us are sinners and in need of a Savior because we're born, we are made in the image of God but that is now a shattered image because we're also made in the image of Adam, our father who fell, and it changed his very nature.  And now he begets children that have that sin nature.  We don't necessarily choose to be born, but sin as such is that we're born with that issue, but we also choose that issue.  And so it's a very interesting dynamic there.  But when we understand that Hitler... the day of judgment is not going to be good for someone like him.  But for the little old lady down the road that just never heard the gospel or whatever, I do believe that there are ways that God gets people's attention before they pass.  And one of the things that I have learned learned and researched and studied.  And I even hesitate to share this because it can be controversial in a certain sense, but death is kind of a process.  And I think sometimes people might know that they're dying.  And I think sometimes God might talk to them in those moments.  And if they know the gospel, and once they realize that they're fading away, but their conscience is still, it's like, wait a minute, it's not fade to black, Metallica reference, but it's actually, wait a minute, I'm still here.  Wow.  And God meets them at that point.  And I don't have a scripture to point to, but I do believe that in His grace and, of course, knowing that death is a process, that when we're warned that death is coming, I think sometimes God really speaks to the heart at that moment.

            "text": "Well, you know, the thing is, too, is as a Christian... we also recognize that God is going to make all the wrongs right.  That we have this confidence that in what is to come for us in the future, that there will be true justice that will be meted out.  And so we have confidence that, again, if somebody is persecuted unjustly or suffers unjustly, in this life, that that will be somehow made right.  We can't understand that necessarily in our finite limitation, but that's very much too part of the gospel.  And the thing is, we all cry for justice, but at the end of the day, if we look in the mirror, do we really truly want justice?  Because that means that the things that we've done that are wrong also are going to have to... There's going to be... something come do for us too.  And so I would beg to argue that this doctor who is kind, who saves lives, also has done things that are not good either.  Because every human being does things that are good and things that are wrong, and he or she would be no different.  So we cry out for justice, but do we really, really want justice when it applies to us as well? ",
