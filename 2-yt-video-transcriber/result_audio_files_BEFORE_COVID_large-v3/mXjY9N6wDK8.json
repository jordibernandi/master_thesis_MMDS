            "text": "So I saw a bunch of people, articles as well, talking about Dave Chappelle's Sticks and Stones regarding, I guess, Rotten Tomatoes low 0% rating that they gave it.  So let's check it out.  I just want to show you something.  Now, the tomato meter is at 0%.  Now I want people to be careful with this because they do have another movie that also is 0%.  So what it sounds like this at least has an audience score already, but what it sounds like is they may have been, they're slow to update it.  Now you can sit and make an argument as that's on purpose and such, but, um, it looks like they're slow to give it, give it a full rating.  Um, uh, And if you do read, however, some of the critics, right, the top critics, they don't like it.  Sticks and Stones is terrible.  Disappointing.  But you did have one person that was like, and they at least gave it a three out of 10.  Is it a failure?  All right, so basically they don't like it for the most part.  Said mostly Mrs.  DeMarc, the truth, yada, yada.  You can take this in a multitude of different ways.  You can say that it's not updated on purpose, right?  You can make that claim.  I'm not going to argue against that.  But I want to be real clear about Rotten Tomatoes and all forms of like critic media, access media and such.  You should not be taking them serious in anything that they say when it comes to reviews of certain things.  These guys are... Certainly when you consider what Rotten Tomato did after the Captain Marvel thing where they basically changed an entire function of their website to protect that, right?  So they have no problem joining in arms with some of the other forms of media and protecting their little baby doll in Captain Marvel, right?  So you gotta take everything that they say with a grain of salt because it's agenda-driven, right?  That's just what it is, right?  It's agenda-driven.  It being harsh on certain movies, no matter how bad they are, may result in something that is detrimental to the personal careers of those that are, you know, reviewing these.  But they're not to be taken serious at all.  Rotten Tomatoes should not be.  Nobody should be taking Rotten Tomatoes serious in their gripes on any movie.  I don't even care if they said it was good.  Doesn't matter.  They just shouldn't be taken into consideration.  They are shield media, if you will.  That's just what it is.  They have clear agendas.  It's always funny when I see these movies come out and they have like the trailer, right?  Rotten Tomatoes gives it a 90%.  It's like, what does that mean?  It means fucking nothing.  It's like asking your own mother to have some sort of objective opinion on their own kid's shitty artwork, right?  Of course they're going to say it's the best thing ever, no matter how shit it is.  It's their mom's.  Maybe your mom's cutthroat and give it to your real ones.  Like, hey, that shit fucking sucks.  You'll never have a career in art.  But you get what I mean, right?  These fools is trash, man.  So you got to take what they say with a grain of salt or a grain of cocaine.  I don't know.  Because you're not going to... You can't take this serious.  Is what I'm trying to say, right?  You can't take it serious.  So I kind of flipped that damn... saying, which I never knew what it meant anyway.  Hey, yeah, y'all don't be taking no damn Rotten Tomatoes serious.  I can't believe I even did a damn video on this, to be honest with you.  Because I thought we've long established and it was solidified after the Captain Marvel thing that these guys are... Who the hell is taking Rotten Tomatoes serious in anything? ",
