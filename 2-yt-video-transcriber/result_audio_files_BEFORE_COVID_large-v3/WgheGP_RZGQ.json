            "text": "It's a very, very bad world.  Bad world.  Listen, I know the phrase, the world's gone mad, is a massive boomer cliche, but Jesus Christ.  If this planet is a computer simulation created in an alien high school science lab, the alien teenagers who created it have all left school, wasted their 20s, embraced meth addiction, and had nervous breakdowns.  The 4th of July celebration coincided with this delightful new trend.  Oh, you foul, put it back, put it back, put it back, put it back.  Because your ancestors totally died for your sacred right to lick ice cream and put it back in the freezer.  Let's go, let's go.  36-year-old Laniece Martin, you can see him here in the video, licking the top of a Blue Bell ice cream tub, moving his finger around the top, licking it again, and then putting it back into the freezer.  At least when the idiots were eating Tide Pods, they were only putting themselves at risk.  Apparently, the risk of 20 years in prison for food tampering is totally worth it for a few million views on Instagram.  Andy Warhol said, in the future, everyone will be world famous for 15 minutes.  But was that transient rush of narcissistic fulfillment really worth it for them?  this to define your life forever.  Still, I guess the embarrassment could be worse.  Oh, my God.  Dublin, this island.  Did you know that?  Is Italy in Rome or Rome in Italy?  Yes, Rome is in Italy.  Rome is the capital of Italy.  Is it?  Is Barcelona in Rome?  Barcelona is in Italy.  I thought it was Spanish.  Dozens of people were shot and five were killed in Chicago over the 4th of July weekend.  So just thank God that police officers are guarding tubs of Ben and Jerry's at your local Walmart.  burp on your zesty salsa.  Burp on your mashed potatoes.  I bet you wish you could buy all the products that I just burped on.  I bet you wish you could find a transcendent purpose in life that goes beyond your addiction to the vacuous, yass girl, fleeting internet clout that renders you a hollowed out, decrepit shell of a human being.  But it ain't happening.  If there's anything worse than eating pre-licked ice cream, it's drinking the dirty bath water of some skanky ethot.  Oh, that actually happened.  Yes.  Everyone's favourite obvious harbinger of imminent societal collapse, Belle Delphine, is selling her own bathwater for $30 a pop.  Rise up, gamer boys.  It's time to get your gamer girl bathwater.  And so many pathetic incels made the purchase, it sold out within 48 hours.  Apparently, this has already led to the breakup of numerous relationships.  Now she's selling an entire tub of it.  On the one hand, you have to admire Belle Delphine's relentless predatory capitalism.  But on the other, you want to find the nearest corner, curl up in the fetal position, and tremble uncontrollably about the utter state of Western masculinity.  Owning Belle Delphine's bathwater is kind of like owning the Shroud of Turin.  But whereas Jesus Christ was the Son of God, rose from the dead, and went on to become the central figure in the world's largest religion, Belle Delphine's most noteworthy talents consist of her doing this... petting googly-eyed dead octopuses, and chucking eggs at mirrors.  Standards have slipped.  I looked at the Game of Bathwater girl's 4 million follower Instagram, and it's like I've been teleported 80 years into the future, and no longer have the slightest grip on culture.  There's a certain line between ballsy entrepreneurship and utter soulless degeneracy.  That line has well and truly been crossed.  What's next?  Gamer boy cummies?  I'm trying... The US women's soccer team beat a bunch of other women to win the World Cup, pleading many to demand they get equal pay to the men.  I mean, it's not like the Women's World Cup earned nearly $6 billion less in revenue than the men's.  And it's not like based on that revenue, equal pay would mean the women getting paid little over than 2% of what the men get paid.  It's not like the US women's professional soccer team got beat 5-2 by a bunch of 14-year-old boys.  Maybe they should get paid the most.  It's only fair, right?  We have to love more, hate less.  Unless you hate your own country and the 63 million people in it who voted for the current president, in which case, hate is fine.  What do you have to say?  What do you deserve?  You deserve all of it.  Empino holding a trophy and a bottle of champagne and yelling, I deserve this, is a mood, an inspiration, a battle cry for women nationwide.  Yeah, it's a mood, if that mood is obnoxious and insufferable clown.  I deserve this!  I deserve this!  Shut your mouth!  Listen up for a second.  First day of camp.  Something really important.  Okay, we're not women's soccer.  We're not the NFL.  If there's anybody here that's going to be disrespectful to either the American or the Canadian National Anthem, grab your gear and get the fuck out now.  But seriously, the women should get equal pay, because all those men who pretended to be interested in women's soccer for the last three weeks will totally continue to be interested in women's soccer, and it totally wasn't just a lame effort at woke virtue-signalling slash pathetic attempt to get laid, and the media's relentless promotion of it every five fucking minutes.  totally wasn't identity politics social engineering.  I just don't know!  The mother of Desmond is Amazing, the 12-year-old drag queen kid, complained about a paedophile sexualizing her son.  Because when she forced him to dance around while attendees threw money at him at a gay club in New York, that totally wasn't sexualizing him.  I don't understand what the... Uh, controversy is- Gee, I wonder if that same pedo will be watching CBC's new documentary about drag queen kids.  Which totally isn't sexualising them either.  What has this world come to?  But who am I to judge?  June was Pride Month.  July the 6th was Pride Weekend.  2019 is Pride Year.  The 21st century is Pride Century.  Was your rainbow flag bigger?  These transnational corporations, many of which do their most lucrative business in countries where they still imprison and torture gay people, totally believe in LGBT rights.  And totally aren't cashing in on that pink pound virtue signal for a slice of free woke advertising.  Must be difficult being so oppressed that the entire globalist capitalist oligopoly has your back.  and don't teach our children that gay is okay because in Islam gay is not okay.  Meanwhile, nearly half of America remains convinced that there are literal legions of Nazis about to take over the country, and that actual concentration camps exist, and that one of the ways to prevent Nazis taking over is to violently bully an eight-year-old off the internet because she parodied AOC.  That's reasonable.  When you beat a gay journalist to brain damage, send death threats to an eight-year-old girl and protest the 4th of July all in the same week.  Hands down.  Are we the baddies?  The Nazis are apparently using this Betsy Ross version of the American flag to organize their planned insurrection.  This white supremacist motif is so powerful that giant versions of it are being displayed at mass Nazi rallies attended by hundreds of thousands of people.  Oh, no, wait, that was Barack Obama's inauguration.  What?  What has this world come to?  But Americans, I'm sorry to break it to you, but if there ever was a clown World Cup, you're always going to come off second best to the United Kingdom.  Guess what our government did to the hero of the London Bridge attack?  The guy who bravely fought off two Islamic terrorists in hand-to-hand combat as they slashed at his throat.  The patriot whose actions almost certainly saved other people's lives.  Guess what they did to that guy?  They put him on a terrorist watch list and forced him to attend de-radicalisation classes.  Oh, and the widow of one of the London Bridge terrorists, she gets taxpayer-funded legal aid.  The actual victims of that same terrorist, they get fuck all.  But hey, at least our police are finally being dispatched to deal with the chronic knife crime and murder epidemic plaguing the streets of London.  Oh no, my bad, they were sent to have their faces painted so they could brag on Twitter about marching at the gay pride parade.  Even as people in surrounding areas at the same time were literally being stabbed to death.  Londoners are fleeing the capital in record numbers primarily due to soaring violent crime.  Children are sewing up their own wounds to avoid arrest.  Even pet donkeys aren't safe from the knife crime wave.  But hey, at least all those middle class white kids got to pay 250 quid so they could get selfies at the Glastonbury Stormzy gig and feel all self-righteous.  Because it's totally the police's fault that all those black kids are killing each other.  And it has nothing whatsoever to do with them having to keep up with the level of violence imported by Congolese and Somalian immigrants.  But at least Morrissey's been completely ostracised from the music industry for daring to say diversity is not a strength.  I mean, obviously Morrissey didn't see the footage from last night in Paris, which served as another reminder that yes, diversity is a strength.  as proven by Algerian football fans who celebrated their team's win by wielding chainsaws, rioting and looting shops.  Obviously Morrissey has been radicalised by that well-known hate preacher and all-round intolerant bigot, the Dalai Lama.  Keep Europe for Europeans.
