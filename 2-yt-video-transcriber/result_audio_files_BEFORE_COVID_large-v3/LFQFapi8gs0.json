And what they brought back from Babylon was this concept of a debt cancellation, an derarum, a clean slate.  And the Hebrew word was deror.  And in the Bible, you'll have the words for the clean slate for the Jubilee year of Leviticus 25.  They didn't realize that when the word gospel was said, the good news, the good news was there's going to be a debt cancellation.  They didn't realize that the Ten Commandments were very largely about debt, that one shall not covet the neighbor's wife.  That means you don't make a loan to the guy so that he has to pledge his wife as a debt slave to her so that you can have your way with her. ",

And as Isaiah said, plot to plot and house to house until there are no more people left in the land. ",
