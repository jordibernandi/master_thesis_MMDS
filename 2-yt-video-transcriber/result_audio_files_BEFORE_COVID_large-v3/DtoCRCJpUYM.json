            "text": "I've heard many rabbis say, Christianity is a beautiful religion and it's wonderful for the Gentiles, but it's not for us Jews.  We have our own covenant with God.  We have the Torah.  On the surface, this sounds like a wonderful open-minded sentiment, but is it true?  Is it tenable?  Is it possible that Jesus is for the Gentiles, but not for the Jews?  Actually, as open-minded as the statement sounds, it creates more problems than it solves.  After all, Jesus, whose Hebrew name was Yeshua, was called Christ because that's the Greek way of saying Messiah.  And his first followers, all of them Jews, believed that he was the long-awaited Messiah, the Redeemer.  If they were right, then he's the Messiah of all the Jewish people.  If they were wrong, he's the Messiah of no one, not of the Jews and not of the Gentiles.  You really can't have it both ways.  You see, a central message of the New Testament is that Jesus came to fulfill the ancient Jewish prophecies, that his life and death and resurrection were foretold in the Hebrew Bible, that Moses spoke about him and Isaiah spoke about him, that the Psalms foreshadowed him.  That's why one of his first followers, again a Jew, exclaimed, We found the one that Moses in the Torah and also the prophets wrote about, Yeshua of Nazareth, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.  That's why Yeshua himself said to some Jewish teachers, if you really believe Moses, you would believe me because he wrote about me.  He was saying, I'm not coming on my own authority.  The very Torah you love speaks about me.  And that's why after his resurrection from the dead, he sat with his devoted followers to say it again, all of them Jews.  And he said to them, these are my words, which I spoke to you while I was still with you.  Everything written concerning me in the Torah of Moses and the prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled.  This theme is repeated over and over in the New Testament, leaving us with one of two choices.  Either Jesus was the prophesied Messiah of Israel, or he was not.  Either he fulfilled the prophecies, or he did not.  If he did fulfill the Messianic prophecies, then every Jew should believe in him.  If he did not, then the New Testament is not true.  He's not the Christ, and no one should believe in him, whether Gentile or Jew.  Not only so, but these same Messianic prophecies declare that the Messiah of Israel would be a light to the nations as well.  He wasn't just for Israel.  He was for the whole world.  Put another way, Jesus is the Savior of the world because he is the Messiah of Israel.  If he's not Israel's Messiah, he's the Savior of no one.  There's something else we need to consider.  According to the New Testament writers, some of whom were eyewitnesses to the events they recorded, Yeshua died on the cross and then rose from the dead on the third day.  This wasn't a matter of speculation for these writers.  This wasn't simply a matter of religious faith.  This was a matter of historical fact.  They saw Jesus die a horrible death.  They saw him buried in a rock tomb.  They saw him after he rose.  Actually, they met with him for weeks after he rose, and then they saw him ascend to heaven.  If this actually happened, then the God of Israel was declaring to the people of Israel, this is my chosen one.  This is your Messiah.  Put your trust in him.  If this didn't happen, then Yeshua's followers were deceived.  Not only so, but since he promised to rise from the dead, he was deceived as well.  Worse still, he was a liar.  Once again, we're left with only two choices.  Either he rose from the dead as proof that he was the promised Messiah, or he did not rise from the dead and his messianic claims are false.  If he rose, then Jews around the world need to recognize him for who he is.  If he didn't rise, then the faith of Christians worldwide is based on a lie.  To say it once more, you cannot have it both ways.  So is it possible that Jesus is for the Gentiles and not for the Jews?  Certainly not.  But if he did, in fact, fulfill the Messianic prophecies, and if he did, in fact, rise from the dead, then Jewish people around the world need to take a fresh look at Jesus Yeshua.  Perhaps he's kosher for Jews after all.  As a Jewish follower of Jesus myself, I can say he most certainly is.  Not only so, but hundreds of thousands of Jews around the world, some from very traditional backgrounds and some from very secular backgrounds, agree that Jesus is the Messiah of Israel.  They're joined by hundreds of millions of Gentiles worldwide coming from Hindu backgrounds and Muslim backgrounds and Buddhist backgrounds and animist backgrounds and downright worldly and sinful backgrounds.  All of them proclaiming Jesus is the Messiah of Israel and the Savior of the world.  They now worship the God of Israel because of Jesus Yeshua.  That too is part of the Messianic mission.  And that means that Jesus is kosher for Jews.  And if he's kosher for the Jewish people, you better believe he's kosher for all people. ",
