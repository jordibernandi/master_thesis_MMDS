            "text": "I'm very hesitant as a Christian to say that that man or woman has a demon inside them.  We often hear Christians and they often say, yeah, that person, they're demonically possessed.  But me, myself and I, I'm quite careful because I don't want to just label people all the time.  And there is such a thing as as serious mental illness.  Now, very recently I was talking to my pastor about this, asking him similar questions, and he said, the way we can tell the difference between someone who is demonically possessed and someone who is mentally ill, is someone who's mentally ill can listen to gospel preaching.  But a demon cannot listen to gospel preaching without manifesting itself.  And today I was on the streets in Manchester.  I've just come back now.  I've got my coffee as a little debrief.  But it's been a really weird day.  And I was going up to different people saying, can I do a little interview?  Can I talk to you about God?  And as I was approaching different people, I saw this guy sitting on a monument and his eyes were just fixed, glazed down.  I thought, oh, he's a bit quirky.  Maybe he's a bit like a sort of Pete Doherty kind of guy.  I'll ask him.  And I went up to him and I said, can I interview you?  And he just stared at me and said, no, I don't want to talk about God.  I don't want to speak about him.  And then on the other side of this statue, on the other side of this monument, I went round and I started to chat to another guy, a Muslim man.  And this is the video you're going to see shortly.  And then this man, who I believe was demonically possessed, he came and he stood next to the camera and then he kept walking back and forth.  And then you'll see what happens in a few moments time, what happens.  And then as he goes off camera, I said to him, I said, do you believe in Jesus?  And he said, no, I'd much rather be possessed.  And you won't be able to see this on the video because we didn't quite catch it.  But he started doing some kind of weird dance.  And then after we finished the interview, five minutes later, this man began to stalk us.  And then he ran past us and said, excuse me, excuse me.  And I'll be honest... Never have I met a man who said he's possessed by a demon, and never have I ever experienced anything like that.  I've seen angry people, I've seen mentally ill people, but there was something very, very different about that man.  When he was stalking us, when he was following us, I'll be honest, I was quite, I was a little bit disturbed, I was a bit uneasy.  And the whole day's been weird.  We then had some drug dealers coming up to us, who wanted to know whether we were undercover police officers.  There's been temptation.  It's just been a really weird day today.  So I'm not sure what to make of it, but I'll let you watch the video.  You tell me in the comment box below whether you think this man did have a demon in him, and I'd ask that you would pray for this man, and not only pray for him, pray for the man that I was sharing the gospel with.

So you might be standing there with dirty, you've done wrong things, but Jesus can wash you.  wash you jesus can wash you and make you whiter than snow.  and that's what we're saying to the to you today that if you ask jesus to forgive you if you put your trust in him he can make you clean and perfect in god's eyes.  but you've got to ask him yeah yeah yeah.

When we preach Jesus Christ, the demons come out.  And I'm not even exaggerating.  the devil does not like this message because there is a heaven and there is a hell and he doesn't like that.  and that guy we went up to speak to him before and he was staring at us very intensely and he didn't like that message.  so there's some evidence for you right now with that.  but your question was essentially what you're saying is I could i could go around sleeping around getting drunk doing what i want and then on my deathbed i say jesus forgive me and everything will be okay.  well put it this way knife i wouldn't do it because you're a really nice guy but suppose i i slap you across the face i wouldn't do it.  and then i say i'm really sorry knife will you forgive me?  uh what would you?  and you say okay joe yeah yeah sure i forgive you i forgive you for what you've done and then two two minutes later i then slap you again around the face.  oh i'm really sorry now okay joe i forgive you.  What would happen after the seventh time if I keep doing that?  You're not really sorry.  And likewise, God knows.  He knows the heart.  He knows that when we receive God, we receive his spirit.  And he knows if we've done right or wrong.  He knows whether we truly love him, whether we truly follow Jesus Christ.  And the Bible says God will not be mocked.  So he knows the real heart and they're the people he'll redeem.  Naive, I'm so grateful for your time.  Really lovely guy.  Thank you for your time.  Thank you very much. ",
