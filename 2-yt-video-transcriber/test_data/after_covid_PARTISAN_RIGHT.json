            "text": "hi friends so a lot of you have been reaching out to me asking me my opinion about what's going on and you know wanting to know my opinion so here's my two cents uh for those of you who don't know me my name is saghar also known as erica for my american friends who can't say saghar i am iranian-american i have spent the last 12 years of my life as a human rights activist working on iran policy watching the middle east yeah it's a super complex issue and many of you probably before today had never ever heard of the name mohandes or soleimani but i feel like we're living in the twilight zone guys i'm i'm completely outraged at this notion that the propaganda machine that is the media is glorifying qasem soleimani do you people know that this man has not only the blood of americans on his hands but the blood of iranians iraqis yemenis afghanis i mean since when did we start mourning the death of a terrorist i mean seriously i've had like friends on the left both iranian and american attack me for echoing the rhetoric of my people the people in iran are happy the people in iran are happy that this man who was responsible for the slaughter of so many people is gone like where was your outrage last month when the regime slaughtered 1600 kids for peaceful protests where's your outrage for the thousands of political prisoners that are in iran right now where was your outrage when the hashtabby took over the american embassy and like vandalized it and killed an american contractor like i i just i don't understand so i'm sorry if i'm i'm ranting but my you know who cares my opinion doesn't really matter but for the you know in the interest of those that have reached out here's the deal i'm an iran watcher i'm an iraq watcher i'm a serial watcher i'm an afghanistan watcher and for the people on the ground they don't hate america they don't hate donald trump in fact there's a lot of training hashtags right now from iran on twitter thank you trump we thank you thank you for you know salamani thank you you know go look for yourselves and you know honestly guys if you don't know anything about the middle east please keep your opinions to yourself i beg you because all you're doing is you're distorting the flow of information you're drowning out the sound that's coming out from the ground and people in iran are happy and they are giving out you know in the middle east it's cultural practice to when something wonderful happens when there's a marriage or when there's a celebration you give out cookies you make cakes and you should see the videos that are coming out people are baking cakes people are giving out cookies in public in the streets because they're happy you know i mean i don't know do we do we live in a closed society that we don't know that most people in you know in the middle east are not free specifically in iran it's an islamic state there's no freedom of religion there's no freedom of speech there's no freedom of peaceful uh you know protest and for anyone who disagrees with the regime they're arrested they're jailed they're tortured you know and yeah there's a lot of video coming out right now about you know the the the funeral of qasem soleimani it's so much propaganda you guys the regime has been saying death to america for 40 years they forced us in school to say death to america i was seven years old i didn't know what i was saying and the people that are like saying that right now they're called the best cg they're like you know they're getting paid they're the ones that get paid to kill people on the street so yeah they're gonna say death to america but that's not the people the majority of the people in the middle east don't hate america they don't hate donald trump and i'm probably gonna lose a lot of friends for saying this but thank you mr trump for making a very hard decision and for having the moral courage to do something that probably a lot of world leaders wouldn't have had anyway that's my two cents i love you guys if you want to have a conversation let's engage let's not attack it's not healthy and hashtag everybody calm down there's no world war three coming okay god is in control not man",
