get you're not gonna get from any other source on the bought-off lamestream fake media folks today I wanna focus on president Trump's trip over Christmas to Iraq now as the globalist puppets and Muppets were yelling about Oh president Trump hasn't visited the military in a battle zone during his presidency as they were mouthing this like Alyssa Milano and a number of other dweebs in Hollywood President Trump was on the plane now he left he left Christmas night it's my understanding that he actually was scheduled to leave on Christmas Eve but ended up having to delay his trip for a day why because of a situation that developed that was unearthed by our intelligence agencies and acted upon by President Trump it's my understanding that Christmas Eve the president became aware through our intelligence agencies that eight world leaders had been targeted for assassination on almost a simultaneous basis the perpetrators behind this plot were based out of the Middle East they were considered to be long-standing terrorist leaders it's my understanding the president Trump delayed the trip because he contacted each of these eight world leaders worked out protection mechanisms for these eight world leaders and then set in motion a means of preventing the attacks from occurring it is my understanding that he actually contacted individuals in the Middle East saying that if any of the eight world leaders were assassinated that holy sites in the Muslim world Mecca and Medina would be targeted president trump it's Maya also understand didn't fly directly to Iraq he flew to two locations where he met some of the world leaders who had been targeted to work out a security plan and to work out a further agreements as it relates to some of these bad actors in the Middle East he then flew to Iraq met with military leaders about us disengaging from Syria from Afghanistan which is a blow to the military industrial complex into the deep state and he met with the troops this is what we saw on TV then he flew to our Air Force Base in Ramstein Germany and I understand he also met with a number of the other world leaders that had been targeted so total of eight world leaders had been targeted by extremists in the Middle East it's my understanding that when he left Germany he he he flew to one other location met with I'm not I'm not gonna call this person a world leader a world figure and then flew home to Washington the question I had was what about the perpetrators behind the plot of the of the assassination of the eight world leaders on an almost simultaneous basis I was told direct quote the terrorist leaders are in the process of being addressed and quote which brings me to Sunday evening January 6th President Trump tweeted that jamal al badwadi a terrorist leader in particular associated with al qaeda had been assassinated now badwadi was a very bad actor he led the attack against the USS Cole in October 12th 2000 that's when the USS Cole was refueling in a Yemen port 17 sailors u.s. naval personnel died 139 were seriously wounded I believe based on the information provided to me badwadi was one of the leaders involved in this most recent terrorist event which was planned to assassinate eight world leaders on an almost simultaneous basis I also believe that there were other terrorist leaders that were involved in that plot and if my sources are accurate we are going to see in the ensuing days and weeks a number of these bad actors also facing the music bottom line the president was getting immense grief for not visiting the troops anyone who was saying that is clueless ignorant he did meet with the troops and yes he was scheduled to leave the day before but if it wasn't for his actions there could well have been a cataclysmic world event which could have led to World War three because of information gleaned through our intelligence agencies and acted upon by President Trump eight world leaders are alive today and the world is a safer place and I believe going to be a much safer place in the days and weeks to come I'd like to thank you for joining me today I'd like to thank you for your time we are available every Sunday 2 to 5
