            "text": "Well, there's a number, there's a number of differences.  One would be, so isn't it?  I'll describe what we are, and then I'll describe what I think Navy Seals are to make that distinction, but certainly for For the SES, we traditionally recruit from REF Army, Navy, Territorios, and the law come in.  And then there's flint of troops in that set.  And we have our own boat troops, of boat troops, one quarter of our squadrons that do that.  And they'll do traditional Navy SEAL type operations generally.  What happens normally for the SPS, the special boat service, is that they are primarily recruited from Marines and that Marines will then join the SPS and the SPS will then do their boat course, whichever boat troop guys go and do with them.  Now that SPS boat course and sort of parts of the Marine course will be similar to what the Navy SEALs go through when they do their training.  And the Navy SEALs in my understanding is that Steel Team 6 are the sort of main counterterrorist unit within the Navy SEALs.  They'll go through quite a rigorous sort of marine based selection process, which will have different modules attached to it.  But then Navy SEALs, and this is where some people get mixed up.  Navy SEALs are probably, particularly SEAL Team 6, are predominantly the main sort of door kickers counterterrorism unit within the US.  People think it's Delta Force.  Delta Force are completely separate, and Delta Force were modeled on the SES.  So there was a major, I don't remember his name, he came across and he saw selection, he saw how the SES were structured and what they were meant for and he went back and he designed almost a sort of replica in terms of a six month selection process, what they were looking for.  And that made Delta Force, who are traditionally from all sort of scrimberies, rangers and all that sort of stuff.  And they have a counterterrorism element to them as well.  But they operate slightly differently in how they go about doing their business.  And the only reason I say that is because I was fortunate enough to do an exchange with both of them.  So when we went out to the Middle East, I ended up in a team with SEAL Team 6 and one of the Delta Force teams as well.  So yeah, they're slightly different in how they are.  People get mixed up between the SES and the SBS.  The SBS are probably closer to SEAL Team 6.  At the SES are a sort of hybrid of Seal Team 6 and Delta Force, you know, just like the arrangers are like our parades.  But to put it in a perspective, the US Marines have more soldiers than our army, more ships than our Navy, and more aircraft than our RAF, and that's just their Marines.  So they're a big unit, the U.S So when the U.S.  talk of its special forces, you know, they've got over 100,000 special forces, you know, we have maybe 500, you know. ",

So we have a lot of X Navy, just like we have a lot of, uh, an area that might be guys from Raffridge and stuff in there.  And so, so, so, so there's a sort of hybrid of all the units within the British military, really, which is one of our strengths, you know, we would want to have all paras, all Marines, you know, all Navy.
