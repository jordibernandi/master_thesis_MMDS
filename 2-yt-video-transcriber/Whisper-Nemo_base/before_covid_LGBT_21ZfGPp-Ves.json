One of the most difficult aspects of altering the voice is learning to separate your resonance from your pitch.  When you finally manage to detangle at least two crucial elements, a vast world of sound will be rewarded to you.  Alright, the way I like to think about this is with a simple x and y graph, okay?  So on this graph, the y-axis represents pitch from high to low.  And the x-axis will represent resonance from dark to bright, okay?  So sit back, get comfortable, and I'm going to show your ear the difference between resonance and pitch once and for all.  Wherever I drag the indicator, that's the sound I'll do my best to make.  Alright, yeah, so I'm gonna start kind of in the middle of the female average here.  And I'm just gonna slowly start to bring the pitch down a little bit on that bus. ",
