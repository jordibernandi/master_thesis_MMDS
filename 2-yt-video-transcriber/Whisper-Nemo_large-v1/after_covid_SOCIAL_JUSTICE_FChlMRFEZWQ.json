Once out of the car, the officers demand to search Serrano's jacket, and he refuses.  As Serrano grows agitated, the officers become more aggressive.  They grab him, push him to the ground and handcuff him.  Serrano remains on the ground, handcuffed and in visible pain for the rest of the traffic stop until an ambulance arrives to take him to the hospital.  The two officers, Kyle Erickson and Elmer Pastran begin searching the car and Serrano's jacket.  Officer Erickson tells Pastran that they need to find evidence.  Officer Erickson begins searching the car.  He searches the passenger side area first.  When he finds nothing, he can be heard murmuring an expletive.  Erickson returns to Pastrana to ask.  He returns to the passenger side and searches through Serrano's jacket, the cup holder, and the central console.  As he continues searching the rest of the car, the driver approaches.  Erickson looks back at Pastrana, visibly agitated.  After several minutes searching the car, Erickson again admits that he hasn't found anything.  Fifteen seconds later, Erickson returns to the front seat cup holder and sets something down.  It's a little bit of weed. ",

A couple minutes later, the two officers say they found wheat flakes in Serrano's jacket.  At the end of the search, Erickson turns to the front.  The officers then fist bump each other.  The few words exchanged between the two officers during the search are almost identical to those they exchanged during the search just a few weeks earlier.  On that occasion, too, the search had ended with Erickson asking Pastrana.  An ambulance finally arrives to pick up Serrano.  He spends the next five days handcuffed in a hospital room, waiting for his abdominal wound to close.  Serrano took a plea deal to avoid jail time and didn't learn of this body cam footage existence until after he pleaded guilty.  The video, which didn't emerge for nearly two years, underscores the limited information available not just to the public, but also defendants, and validates criticism by police accountability advocates that body cameras are of little use if the evidence they capture remains inaccessible.  The NYPD declined to comment on this incident.  Erikson and Pastron remain on patrol. ",
