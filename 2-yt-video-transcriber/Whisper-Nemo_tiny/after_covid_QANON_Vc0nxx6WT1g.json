            "text": "Well, as a number, there's a number of differences.  One would be, so as an, I'll describe what we are, and then I'll describe what I think Navy Cills are, to make that distinction, but certainly for For the SES, we traditionally recruit from RAF Army, Navy, Territorials, and the law come in, and then there's plenty of troops in that set.  And we have our own boat troops of boat troops, one quarter of our squadrons that do that.  And they'll do traditional Navy SEAL type operations generally.  What happens normally for the SPS, the special boat service, is that they are primarily recruited from Marines, and that Marines will then join the XPS, and the XPS will then do their boat course, whichever boat group guy is going to do with them.  Now, that SPS boat course, and sort of parts of the Marine course will be similar to what the Navy SEALs go through when they do their training.  And Navy SEALs, in my understanding, is that Sylteen sex of the sort of main camera terrorist unit within the Navy seals.  They all go through quite a rigorous sort of marine based selection process, which will have different modules attached to it.  But then Navy seals, and this is where some people get mixed up.  Navy seals are probably, because particularly, seal team sex are predominantly the means of a door kicker's panoterrorism unit within the U.S.  People think it's Delafords.  Delafords are completely separate, and Delafords were modeled on the SES.  So there was a major, I'm trying to remember his name.  He came across and he saw selection.  He saw how the SES were structured and what they were meant for.  And he went back and he designed almost a sort of replica in terms of a six month selection process, what they were looking for.  And that made Delta Force, who are traditionally from all sorts, screened rays, rangers, and all that sort of stuff.  And they have a counterterrorism element to them as well.  But they operate slightly differently in how they go about doing the business.  And not the reason I see that is because I was fortunate enough to do an exchange with both of them.  So when we went out to the Middle East, I ended up in a team with 166 and one of the Delta Force teams as well.  So yeah, the slightly different and how they are and people get mixed up between the SES and the SPS and the SPS are probably closer to 166. at the SES or a sort of hybrid of 166 and Delta Force, you know, just like their ranges are like our pirates, but to put in a perspective, the U.S.  Marines have more soldiers than our army, more ships than our navy and more aircraft than our RAF, and that's just their marines.  So there are big units in the US.  So when the US talk of its special forces, you know, they've got over 100,000 special forces, you know, we have maybe 500, you know. ",

And so this is a sort of how you grade of all units within the British military really, which is one of our strengths, you know, we would want to have all paras, all marines, you know, all navy, we laid the fact that we've got people from all different backgrounds and stuff.
