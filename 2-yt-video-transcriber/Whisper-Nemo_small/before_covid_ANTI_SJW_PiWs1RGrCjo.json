            "text": "So last Halloween, we had a lot of fun killing evil spirits, but this year we wanted to up the ante.  So we may or may have not rented the most haunted house in Texas.  And I didn't know what ring that was.  Let me take this.  Hello?  I'm gonna get you like a fish.  Now that is the spirit.  Where are ya?  I'm already in the house.  You're in the house?

Not a reliable chainsaw.  Push the choke.  The other button, it should be under it.  Good?  There you go, big guy.  So I'm not going to lie.  I'm having a decent amount of fun.  The group is having a blast.  But I've been frustrated in the fact that someone said they'd gut me like a fish and I can't find them.  But, but, I have a solution.  I am a classy lady.  Oh, such a good flesh.  Single as what?  I'm just trying to have a good time with my friends.  What did I hear?  You are single as me.  What?  And once again, you won't let me do anything.

Good thing I'm already dead, you jerk.  Oh, that was a bad spin chair.  Let me try that again.  The last zombie horde is gone, and it is amazing to see that ridding.  the world of evil brings such a diverse group of people together.  But I guess that's America.  Cheers, and happy Halloween.
