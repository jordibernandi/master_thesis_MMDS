Well, in that case, I forgive you, Notmohamed. Excellent. Um, BTW, it is my understanding that you are having the... How you say... Sheep? Healing powers. Here we go. For instance, in the Bible, there were certain people you laid your hands upon and healed them and... wondering if maybe you could do the same for me, but without any actual physical contact. Why? What's wrong? No, no, nothing. Nothing at the moment. But... I was wondering if maybe you had a... How you say... A coronavirus vaccine miracle that would make me immune. It does not work that way, Notmoh. You gotta have faith you won't get it. And then... Maybe you will and maybe you won't. Who knows. Um, I am having faith. Thank you very much. Really? It doesn't seem like it. I mean, uh, why don't you just fly a plane into the virus? Wow! Jesus. Viruses... First of all, viruses are exceptionally tiny and... So? So... One would have to be a pilot of exceptional skill and... Doesn't sound like faith to me. I am so sick of this, you son of a whore! Hey, I told you, my mother was a virgin.

Some say he wants to use the roll for good. As a shining beacon of hope for a world that has nothing left. Others say it's pure greed that drives him. And that he'd waste the last roll on nothing more than a wicked case of Hershey's squirts. But the wise ones know that none of that truly matters.
