But this is just going to be a straight analysis of what you can get out of the actual footage, as in what was the cause of this, how big was the explosion.  So what we're actually looking at here is there is a burning building.  This is the burning building down by the docks.  There's little explosions going off inside of it.  And then there is a large explosion which rapidly obscures the... There's a condensation wave that rapidly obscures what's going on.  The most important thing in judging the size of the fireball, the size of the explosion, is that, which is basically the immediate size of the fireball.  After that, you can get a rough estimate of the size of the explosion.  Now, the first thing that this immediately reminds me of is the worst industrial disaster in American history, which was the Texas City disaster, where a ship carrying ammonium nitrate had caught fire and loads of people gathered to watch the burning ship because it was kind of interesting.  The thing is that ammonium nitrate is a tricky one.  It's used by the thousands of tons for fertilizer.  And most of the time, if it's a bit damp or... Loads of other reasons.  It won't explode.  It won't detonate.  It'll just burn, which is what happened to the Grand Camp.  But if you get past a tipping point, it detonates. ",
