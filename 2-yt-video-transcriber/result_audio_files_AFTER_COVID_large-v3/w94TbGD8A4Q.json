            "text": "Hey folks, Eric Stackelbeck here.  Welcome to a special weekend update edition of the Watchman Newscast.  Happy New Year to everyone.  I hope you had a great New Year's Eve, New Year's Day, and of course a great Christmas Day with your loved ones.  2021 is only two days old and already we've got some major developments for you out of the Middle East that you need to know about.  Chief among them... The Iranian regime directly threatening the life of President Trump.  as the one-year anniversary of the death of Iranian terror kingpin Qasem Soleimani looms tomorrow, January 3rd.  We've got a lot to discuss.  Before I get into it, I just want to encourage you to subscribe to the Watchman News channel right here on YouTube and click the notification bell so you get alerts Every time a new video is posted, we've been posting new videos practically every day now for the past week and a half or so because we all have that January 3rd date circled on our calendar and for good reason.  for weeks now.  The Iranian regime has been breathing threats of revenge and retaliation against the United States over that drone strike that took out Soleimani last year, January 3rd.  Is it all just bluster for domestic consumption?  Folks, I hope so.  I hope that tomorrow, January 3rd, passes with barely a ripple, not to mention January 4th, 5th, and beyond, and all of 2021.  But... When evil men tell you they want to kill you, if the 20th century teaches us anything, right?  The century of Mao, Saddam, Stalin, and Hitler, they announced their plans.  They told everyone what they wanted to do.  When evil men do that, we should listen to them and take them at their word.  So I hope, again, that none of this is true and none of it pans out.  But here's what the Iranian regime is saying.  Yesterday in Tehran, a major event at Tehran University, including delegations from Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Yemen, all of Iran's proxy satellite states.  We had this event commemorating the one-year anniversary of the death of Qasem Soleimani with some major Iranian regime officials speaking.  One of them was the head of the Iranian judiciary, a guy by the name of Ibrahim Raisi, who is a very influential figure and very well respected in the Iranian regime.  Here's what he had to say about President Trump and Soleimani's death.  Quote, and I'm just reading from my laptop.  I do not want to misquote these people.  He said they, meaning the United States, will witness severe revenge.  What has come so far has only been glimpses of what is coming.  He went on to say, quote, do not presume that someone as the president of America, President Trump, who appeared as a murderer or ordered a murder may be immune from justice being carried out.  Those who had a role in this assassination will not be safe on earth.  Now he's saying, this is the head of Iran's judiciary, a very powerful figure in the regime.  He is saying, number one, directly threatening the United States and the leader of the United States, President Trump, vowing severe revenge and saying President Trump is not immune from Iranian revenge and that he, the president, will not be safe on Earth.  That's a very serious threat, I would say, folks.  And President Trump is the man, obviously, who last year ordered that U.S.  drone strike that led to the demise of Qasem Soleimani, who at the time was planning new attacks against U.S.  forces in Iraq and around the region.  And a man who also had the blood of hundreds, if not thousands, of U.S.  soldiers on his hands from the previous decade before.  by directing attacks against US troops in Iraq.  That was Qasem Soleimani.  I know that the mainstream media and many in Europe and the left here in the United States weeped and gnashed their teeth when Soleimani was killed, but he was an evil man and he had very evil intentions planned before he was killed.  Very interesting here that Hassan Rouhani who, again, the mainstream media and European diplomats like to paint as a moderate force, a moderating voice in Iran, Hassan Rouhani, the Iranian president.  They love to meet with him in the halls of European capitals.  Well, here's what Hassan Rouhani said on Wednesday, December 3rd.  about the United States and Qasem Soleimani.  Remember, this is the man who's been called the great moderate hope of the Iranian regime.  Here's what he said, quote, the martyrdom of martyr Soleimani was revenge against the Islamic Republic of Iran.  He went on to say that because Iran has stood against the conspiracies of the United States and Zionism and foiled that conspiracy, And he lastly said, addressing the U.S.  and Israel, Rouhani vowed to, quote, cut off your leg from the region and we will continue the resistance until that day.  So this is Hassan Rouhani.  Again, this is look, this is the moderate, reasonable face of the Iranian regime.  So that's an update for you.  What top?  Keyword there, folks, top Iranian officials are saying as January 3rd looms.  Again, I hope this day passes and nothing happens.  But there are serious concerns among U.S.  officials that Iran may try something either directly or through proxy.  That's why, as we have reported here in the Watchman newscast over the past few days, we saw a U.S.  nuclear submarine pass through the Straits of Hormuz at Iran's doorstep.  We've seen U.S.  B-52 bombers pass fly low over the Persian Gulf on at least three occasions in the past 50 days or so, all sending a message to Iran, don't even think about it.  That's the message.  But what about the Israel side of things?  Okay, we've also been reporting for you that in the wake of the death of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, again, man, 2020, tough year for the Iranian regime, right?  Bookended by the death of Qasem Soleimani in January and the demise of Fakhrizadeh in late November.  Iran has been blaming Israel for Fakhrizadeh's death on November 27th.  He was, again, the father of the Iranian nuclear bomb.  Not a very nice man, but the Iranian regime blaming Israel, also vowing revenge for that.  So Israel is also on high alert.  We saw an Israeli submarine pass through the Suez Canal and surface in the Persian Gulf recently.  Once again, sending that message to the.  there continues to be concerns that Iran will indeed try to lash out against Israel, most likely through proxy.  That's been their M.O.  over the years, right?  We had an interesting interview yesterday in Israel Hayom, the daily newspaper in Israel, where a top Israel Defense Forces official said, and again, I want to quote it.  He said, there's, quote, a high probability that the northern border, Israel's northern border would see a resumption of full-blown hostilities.  This requires the IDF to prepare accordingly.  The chances of a sudden escalation are on the increase.  That means Hezbollah, folks, in southern Lebanon and also in Syria, along with the Iranian regime.  We've talked about it so many times here on the Watchman News Channel, that great northern war which is coming to Israel's north, pitting the IDF against Israel.  Hezbollah and the Iranian regime and their various radical allies across southern Lebanon and in Syria at Israel's doorstep.  And I've told you I've interviewed Israel Defense Forces officials on and off the record over the past year or two.  And they've all said, hey, it's a question out of if but when that great northern war is coming.  So that's an interesting quote from the IDF, from a top IDF official who was unnamed, by the way, in this Israel Hayom article, which was published just yesterday.  Also, and we reported this last week on the Watchman Newscast.  You can always check out all of our newscasts in our archives here.  Also, we have a real concern from the IDF.  that in this Iranian retaliation, of course, we have Hezbollah, Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, all pressing on Israel from Israel's direct borders.  But the interesting wrinkle, the disturbing wrinkle that the IDF has been discussing for the past week or so is that perhaps some of these Iranian proxies in Iraq or Yemen may try to strike Israel.  I'm talking about the Houthis in Yemen, those Iran-backed Shia rebels, and then those various radical Shia militias that are under Iranian control in Iraq.  The Israel Defense Forces is very concerned that you could see precision smart missiles fired from Yemen or Iraq or drones flown from Yemen or Iraq to strike targets inside Israel.  So the plot thickens, right?  We usually are talking about the again.  the actors the bad actors perched on israel's direct borders in gaza in lebanon in syria.  now it's widened to iraq to yemen and this is what really qasem soleimani who is the architect of iran's entire terror strategy.  this was his goal to broaden iran's reach and its ability the tentacles of the iranian regime and its ability to strike at israel.  So we will continue to pray for the peace of Jerusalem, for all of Israel, for U.S.  troops in the region as well.  One quick nugget to share with you.  Along these lines, as Iran talks about revenge, part of that revenge clearly is ramping up their nuclear weapons program.  We've reported here several times on the Watchman newscast over the past month or so that the Iranian regime is enriching uranium at at least 12 times the level permitted under that 2015 Iran nuclear deal.  Again, just yesterday, January 1st, the Iranian regime reported to the IAEA, the International Atomic Agency at the UN.  Iran reported to the IAEA and said, oh, by the way, we are going to begin enriching uranium at a 20% rate, pure uranium at a 20% rate.  Not to get too in the weeds, folks.  Just know that to build a nuclear bomb, you need to enrich a lot of uranium.  Now, ideally, you would enrich uranium at a 90% clip, but according to atomic experts, which I am not one, but just in researching everything and keeping on top of this, they're saying, look, it's not a real, it's a hop, skip, and a jump, basically, to get from 20% enriched uranium to 90%.  And right now, Iran probably already has enough enriched uranium to make one, if not two, nuclear bombs, if they so choose.  so what a way to start the new year right with iran declaring to the eye.
