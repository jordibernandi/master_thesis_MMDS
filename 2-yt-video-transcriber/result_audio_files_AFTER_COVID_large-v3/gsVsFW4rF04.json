I also think that something does need to be changed in terms of how minorities are treated in America.  On the other hand, I'm not a huge fan of violence and property destruction.  There have been a lot of small business owners who were originally thinking about reopening after the virus situation, but will no longer do so due to their stores being looted.  These people, who have absolutely nothing to do with anything, just trying to grow their small businesses, are left picking up the pieces of their property.  That's something I cannot support.  Don't even get me started on violence against other human beings.  For those that are peacefully protesting, good on ya.  That's the type of stuff I like to see.  But there can be a lot of violent actions taken against peaceful protesters by the police too.  I have seen way too many clips of peaceful protesters in Washington DC get flash banged and pepper sprayed.  Law enforcers in certain areas are overreacting quite a bit.  Speaking of which, this is honestly one of the worst times to possibly hold protests and riots.  We're still in the middle of a pandemic.  Even if the protesters and police are taking precautions, couldn't this have been done at any other time?  I just don't want to see the situation of COVID-19 become worse than it already is.  At the very least, everyone should be wearing face masks, and we should ban the use of pepper sprays.  Pepper spray promotes coughing and rubbing of the eyes, both of which will contribute to the spread of the virus.  Anyway, overall, I support the ideas of this protest, I just wish there was a better method and a better time to do this.  I mean, it's pretty obvious he's dead, they even did an autopsy on him. ",

            "text": "Are you talking about the boosters?  They're important in assisting spacecrafts escape the gravitational pull of the Earth during the first two minutes or so of launch.  Once the boosters are out of fuel, they are detached from the main body of the spacecraft because their presence would just add additional unwanted weight.  Many of them land in the ocean, which is recollected and their materials recycled.  But for more recent spacecraft such as the Falcon 9, the boosters would land on a platform so that it could be preserved for even more recycling purposes.  Now, there's a reason the camera goes out.  Because the platform where the booster lands is far out at sea, it needs to signal a satellite in order to get the livestream broadcasted.  The signal needs to be directional in order for it to be strong enough.  As the booster gets close to the platform, it shakes the platform due to the engine thrust, which disrupts the signal traveling to the satellite, ultimately cutting out the feed.  That's why we don't see the landing specifically, but more so before and after it happens when the platform stabilizes.  But anyway, I don't see why this is even a point for Flat Earthers to even bring up, because it's not that relevant to what they care about. ",

Imagine scientists trying to find a new treatment for cancer and one scientist goes, I don't need to do research, I've seen YouTube videos.  Look them up yourself, they have the answers.  Honestly, YouTube is a place with a lot of misinformation.  You have people presenting things that goes against what we know from science, people claiming the wildest things, never go to YouTube for reliable information.  There are some educational channels out there, but for those, I would still stick to checking the sources, because YouTube is just a platform for presenting your own opinions.  That's it.  And it seems that Flat Earthers have established quite a presence here.  YouTube videos claiming that satellites are just strung up on balloons?  How does anyone even believe that?  Balloons can't stay in the air forever.  The most likely outcome is that they begin leaking air, and the balloon shrinks as it descends back to Earth.  Now, if you're talking about those massive, massive balloons, then yeah, they can stay in the sky for a longer period of time.  But here's the thing, you can actually see satellites from Earth.  Yep, this can be done with a vision enhancer such as a binocular, or even with just the naked eye.  The chances of seeing one significantly increases if the satellite in question is in low Earth orbit, which according to Google, there are about 800 of them.  So go ahead and find a satellite, then tell me if you see it being attached to a balloon, which would have to be pretty massive to hold up such a big object, because so far, I don't see any balloons.
