If he had any intelligence, he would have pretended that he had the integrity to come to my defense.  And he doesn't.  And you... It's so transparent, but it will work.  He's got a book coming out, and so he sort of, he attempted to sort of attack to the center and be Larry King, and now he's realizing, like, I need a platform.
