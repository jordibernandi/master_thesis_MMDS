You shouldn't have brought me here, because you knew I was going to freak out!  Because I'm a super trooper!  Come on, look at me and say that you're a good commander!  Huh?!  We'll always have a place as soldiers in the hearts of men, in the minds of angels, in the souls of the warrior spirit.  There's one thing that matters.  It's the mission.  Do you understand me?  What's the mission?  The mission is to finish the fight.  It might cost our lives.  It might cost our sanity.  It might cost whatever it is we've been fighting for.  But what the hell is a war without a mission?  What is it?  This is a warrior's creed.  Those guys have no idea what we're up against.  They haven't seen a laser war like this.  The commander's screwing with our hands to get the mission done.  You're a dirty fucking android.  Now if you're with me, let me hear your best battle cry.  Hoo-wah!  Hoo-wah!  How are we supposed to win this war?  It's us or them!  Joseph!  Snap out of it, man!  Cipher!  It's me, Stoven!  We got a bigger war to fight!  Don't let this be the end!  Mission briefing just says one thing.  Objective number one.  Whatever it takes.  I've never had my life in your hands like it is right now.  Commander Wick, are you in?  People keep asking me.  Are you working again?  Are you back?  And yeah, I'm thinking I'm back!  The war still reaches for them.  It's time for you to get the old squad back together again, Commander. ",
