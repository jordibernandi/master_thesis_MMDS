            "text": "hey everybody pastor greg laurie with some thoughts about the election.  okay right now in america we're in turmoil trying to determine who the president of the united states is.  that's a very important discussion But let me kind of pull the camera back and look at the bigger picture for us as Christians.  Listen, our objective as Christians is to not be a partisan, it's to be a peacemaker.  Let's look for ways to bring the love of Jesus to people.  Listen, if your theology slash political ideology makes you a mean shouting person, maybe you need to dial that back a little bit.  And let's think about how we can help bring calm to our nation in the days ahead.  I don't know what the final decision is going to be, but I know this much.  God is sovereign and God is in control.  Let's pray for his will to be done.  And let's work on not being troublemakers as much as we should work on being peacemakers.  Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God.  May God direct and guide the United States of America.  And may we find His perfect will together.
