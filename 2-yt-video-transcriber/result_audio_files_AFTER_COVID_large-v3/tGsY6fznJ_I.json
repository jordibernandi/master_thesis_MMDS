            "text": "Okay, so today we're going to take a look at why the big cloud on the Beirut explosion here was so red which is something that is super peculiar on explosions and of course there's several explanations in the media as to why this is which are almost certainly wrong on many different levels and And they've since crept into things like Wikipedia.  So, yeah, this is sort of correcting the record on that.  Now, you know.  It's super rare that you get a really colourful cloud off an explosion.  There really aren't many things that can do it.  This, to me, looks very ferric, very iron-rich, which is bizarre because iron is fairly heavy stuff, and so they don't usually use it in rockets or explosives or that sort of thing.  And if you come to the BBC, you will find that their explanation is, right, so it's ammonium nitrate.  That I'm sort of fairly happy with.  as to what the original cause of this explosion is.  There's about just sort of 3,000 tons of ammonium nitrate stored here.  My estimate yesterday was about a kiloton of explosion.  The actual explosion itself is about a kiloton.  So, I mean, that all vaguely gels.  But for the rest of it, this just goes off into.  that's not how chemistry works territory.  So the bits that they get right, ammonium nitrate, when it comes in contact with fire, it can sort of basically just decompose.  That's all fine.  When it explodes, it can release toxic gases, including nitrogen oxides and ammonia gas.  And it's like, eh, not really.  So the thing is, when it detonates, this really isn't how it detonates.  So if you come to the wiki article, you will find that if you just heat it up, it's called deflagration.  It basically decomposes and you get some steam off and some dinitrogen oxide.  This stuff is laughing gas.  It's not brown.  And if you get it to the point where it detonates, you get predominantly this sort of reaction here.  Now, the reason you don't get nitrogen dioxide... If you read further, it'll say that, yeah, many ammonium nitrates, life's lost.  The brown colour in the explosion cloud is due to nitrogen dioxide, to which the answer is... I don't think so.  So nitrogen dioxide is different from dinitrogen oxide, which is laughing gas.  And this stuff is evil, brown, toxic.  You get it with water and it eventually forms nitric acid.  But the basic chemistry, this by the way has all been added since yesterday.  If you take a look at the entry from yesterday, you will find that there is absolutely nothing about, okay you've got nitrogen monoxide here, that will almost immediately oxidize in our atmosphere to form nitrogen dioxide.  But the main problem that you have here is the way that you make ammonium nitrate in the first place is you basically get nitric acid and ammonia and they react together.  They release a load of heat.  And if you want to split them up again, you've got to put that heat back in.  So it's basically endothermic reaction.  You've got to put in energy to get the nitric acid out.  And then you've got to put even more energy in to the nitric acid to get it to decompose to essentially give nitric oxides.  And that's a problem.  That means you've got to put energy into it.  The way that it detonates is mainly releasing energy.  Now, you know, explosions are fairly high energy things, so you can get some obscure things happening.  But you really don't expect nitrogen dioxide that much in these sorts of explosions.  And you can maybe get some examples of this if you go to, you just look for US Army destroying ammonium nitrate.  And so they've got a little pile of stuff here, which they're going to explode.  And you'll find that, right, so again, we're sort of on furiky-looking ground here.  I'm U.S.  Army Staff Sergeant Walter Talens.  Boom.  So there is little hints of brown here.  This is the sort of thing that I could quite happily accept is nitrogen dioxide.  But the majority of the explosion is, you know, I could also quite happily accept that's just dust being thrown up from the ground.  There you go.  The majority of the explosion here is sort of brown and grayish.  It is certainly not that color, right?  So what the hell is going on here?  Well, normally, yeah, just so you know, let's go back to the original wiki article before it got amended due to the... due to the Beirut explosion.  You'll notice that in the explosion you get oxygen given off.  So one of the popular quarry explosives is you mix some diesel into it.  that actually reacts with the oxygen and gives you even more energy out of this.  It doesn't matter really what it is.  And that's Amtol, I think.  Is that Amtol?  So you just mix a bit of fuel oil in there and basically it reacts with the oxygen that's given off.  So that's the sort of classical reaction that goes on when ammonium nitrate detonates.  So what the hell is this big red cloud?  Well, when I took a look at the aftermath pictures this morning, it becomes almost instantly obvious what this cloud is.  and yeah so you you start to get to see it just from some of the drone flyovers that this is looking kind of farraki reddish soil here.  and if you look at some of the other pictures of the you know just do an images search for the soil in beirut you'll find that some of it is ferociously red stuff.  um So let's see if we can find some other pictures.  It's a brownie, reddy, but some of it is, yeah, it's crazy red.  So my reading of it is that what you actually had in... In fact, there's some of the pictures from the BBC.  Yeah, here you go.  You can sort of see that there's all sorts of red dust there.  If it was nitrogen dioxide, it's a gas.  It never goes away like that.  Sorry, if it's a gas, it'll just diffuse and it'll be gone.  It's not going to exist like this on the ground.  So that's kind of my reckoning is what was here before the explosion was, it was probably underground.  And yeah, that's why, if you actually take a look at the explosion... Yeah, I mean, it looks like this actually comes up with the top of the blast.  It's one of the first things up there.  So even at that, it's remarkably red.  If I remember rightly, this would be another thing that argues against nitrogen dioxide.  If I remember rightly, nitrogen dioxide, as it gets hotter, it becomes colourless.  Let me just show you.  It's one of these famous things.  At low temperature, yeah, at high temperature, it goes to nitrogen dioxide.  At low temperature, it dimerises, and I think that's brown colour.  Oh no, I've got it the wrong way around.  Okay, it becomes colourless as it gets cold.  Okay, I'm the wrong way around.  So that would suggest that it could be nitrogen dioxide, but Okay, right, so this definitely argues against it.  If you get your nitrogen dioxide, yeah, this is the bit I remember.  God, this is a long time ago.  I used to do stuff like this when I was a kid.  You get your nitrogen dioxide and you heat it up above 150 degrees and it becomes nitrogen monoxide, which is colourless.  So above 150 degrees it becomes colourless.  So if this is an explosion, usually in an explosion things are very hot at the beginning.  So if this was nitrogen dioxide you would expect it to be colourless for the initial explosion and then you would expect it to become brown later.  So, yeah, that's my explanation, is that is basically the topsoil being blown up in the air because it's an underground bunker.  Okay, so, yeah, if someone wants to get some sources off their wiki, I looked around for quite a lot of ammonium nitrate explosions, and I couldn't find any.  Yeah, I mean, some of them give off brownish... clouds, but it's never quite clear.  Mythbusters did one of these.  It's not quite clear whether that brown colour is just the dust that comes up from the topsoil.  They're very much like this.  This is your typical explosion.  You don't get this bright brick red.  Even that, that's still dark.  It's conceivable there's some chemistry going on here.  Actually, okay, I'm going to give you a suggestion here, right?  If this is just a conventional explosion and you're getting oxygen, if that's a hugely oxygen-rich plume, that would oxidize the iron to make it look redder.  Anyway, so that's my suggestion as to why the plume in this case was so red, and I reckon the BBC and Wiki, eh, they're barking up the wrong tree here.  So, I hope you found that interesting, and thanks for watching. ",
