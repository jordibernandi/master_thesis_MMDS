            "text": "In a world experiencing uncertainty and so many different seen and unseen dangers of every kind, it's comforting to know that God has promised to protect his children.  Life is not a playground, but it is a battleground.  However, we must always know and hold the divine assurance that we have been given by God.  that God is watching over us and is protecting us at all times.  What you need to know first and foremost is that everything that is valuable is protected.  Whether you believe it or not, you are valuable to God.  you can reject this truth but it does not negate the fact.  it does not negate the fact that you are precious to God and for this very reason whilst you're still on earth God has put measures in place to ensure your protection.  so today I'm going to look at six different ways God protects you as his child.  firstly God protects you by his constant surveillance.  Nothing on this earth happens outside of the field of sight of God.  In actuality, nothing happens in this universe outside his scope of vision.  2 Chronicles 16 verse 9.  For the eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth to show himself strong on behalf of those whose heart is loyal to him.  How does this make you feel?  To know that God is watching you.  How does it make you feel?  Does it make you feel scared and nervous at the fact that God is watching you?  Or does it give you an additional level of peace?  Knowing that you're under the constant watch of a loving God who has nothing but your best interest in his heart.  So let me ask the question again, how does this make you feel, knowing that God is watching over you?  Does it make you nervous and scared?  Or does it give you an additional level of peace?  I guess it comes down to your perception of God.  If you view God as a cosmic tyrant who is looking for you to fall short of the standard of the word of God, so he can crush you with his right hand, then yes, I would be nervous.  Yes, I would be scared.  But if your perception of God is that he's a loving God who sent his only begotten son to die for your sins and your transgressions because he knew you could never bridge the gap of sin.  So his only begotten son who was perfect in holiness.  perfect in righteousness, perfectly perfect, had to bridge the gap of sin so that you may have eternal life.  If your perception is of this loving God, yes, you will receive another level of peace, knowing that God is watching over you.  Even if your enemies are plotting and scheming against you, God is there on your behalf to ensure their plan backfires.  Remember in Psalm 23 verse 5, it states that God will prepare a table for you in the presence of your enemies.  Change your perception of God.  God is not against you.  God is for you.  God is for you.  Romans 8 verse 31.  What shall we then say to these things?  If God be for us, who can be against us?  Change your perception of God.  God is not out to get you.  Believe me, if God was out to get you, he would have got you years ago.  God is on your side.  I'm sorry to keep repeating this statement, but this needs to penetrate your spirit.  God is on your side and he's watching over you, not to get you, but he's watching over you to protect you.  Secondly, in God's arsenal of protection, he has an innumerable number of angels at his disposal, ready to be deployed for your defenses.  In the Bible, there are countless number of narratives that depict this protection.  A perfect example of this is seen in 2 Kings 6, verse 17.  And Elisha prayed, Open his eyes, Lord.  so that he may see.  Then the Lord opened the servant's eyes, and he looked and saw.  the hills were full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha.  In this situation, Elisha and his servant Gehazi was surrounded by an army of men.  Gehazi was gripped with fear, not knowing the great army of the Lord surrounding him and Elisha.  It was only after Elisha prayed that he saw the vast army of heaven around him.  That same protection belongs to us today.  You literally have an army of angels watching over you.  So the next time when the chips are down, when you're feeling afraid, remember that an army of angels is watching over you, ready, ready at the beck and call of the Lord to come rescue you in whatever situation you may find yourself in.  Even in today's day and era, there are so many personal testimonies by children of God of miraculous escapes by angelic means, which defy all rationale and all human explanation.  Psalms 91 verse 11, For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways.  You don't have to live a fearful and limited life.  Believe that God loves you and that his angels walk with you day by day.  And they are there to watch over you.  The third and fourth way God protects us is by building hedges of protection around his people.  Like what we read in the book of Job.  The devil could not do anything to harm Job because there was a hedge of protection surrounding him.  We therefore can conclude God puts a hedge of protection around his saints for protection, so that the enemy cannot reach you.  Just like in Psalms 125 verse 2, As the mountains are around Jerusalem, so the Lord is around his people, from henceforth even forever.  You are surrounded.  Don't ever have any doubts about it.  You are surrounded by a hedge of protection.  In the Bible, that is a statement of facts, not opinion, but fact.  If we look more closely at the story of Job, there are three great truths we learn from the devil's statement in Job 1.10.  The devil says, You have made a hedge around him and his house and all he has on every side.  We learn the following.  That firstly, God has a hedge around him personally.  Therefore, God has a hedge around you as an individual.  Secondly, we learn that God had a hedge of protection around Job's family.  Therefore, God has a hedge of protection around your family.  Thirdly, we learn that God had a hedge of protection around Job's finances and his property and all his endeavors.  Therefore, God has a hedge of protection around your finances, your properties and all your endeavors.  So we can live with the comfort and the peace of knowing that that same protection which was upon Job is upon us.  We cannot see these hedges of protection around us.  But they are there.  God does not leave his children exposed.  Because we know that the enemy comes to do only three things.  To steal, kill and destroy.  If God's hedge of protection was not upon us, the enemy would have done all those three things to us already.  But thank God for his hedge of protection.  The fifth way God protects us is through the Holy Spirit.  The Bible teaches us that as many are led by the Spirit of God, they are the children of God.  Therefore, when the Holy Spirit leads us as His children, He guides us to go to the right places at the right time, to do the right thing at the right time.  Therefore, our protection is in the guidance of the Holy Spirit.  I think At one point or another, we have all experienced an inner voice telling us not to go somewhere, and without us knowing, that was the Holy Spirit guiding us and leading us in the Spirit.  If you think back in your life, there have been incidences you have experienced being led by the Spirit.  At points you think it's just a weird feeling you'd have, telling you not to go to a location, or telling you not to do this, or telling you not to do that.  but you could never put your finger on it.  And in actuality, it was the Holy Spirit leading you.  The Holy Spirit guides us and protects us in more ways than we could ever imagine.  I genuinely believe that if we could see all the times the Holy Spirit has protected us, has guided us out of so many bad situations, we would genuinely not want to leave our house.  This is why we should pray to the Lord to give us the grace to hear and to understand and most importantly to obey the Holy Spirit when he leads us.  The sixth way God protects you is through the blood of Jesus.  The blood of Jesus is the only way you can receive redemption and be spared from the wrath of God.  You are cleansed and justified and forgiven by the blood of Jesus.  the blood of Jesus holds power and authority.  the blood of Jesus has the ability to command and control because it is supreme.  you see you could read the whole Bible.  you could pray fifty times a day seven days a week but without the blood of Jesus there is no power.  without the application of the blood of Jesus there is no authority.  without the power of the blood of Jesus you cannot defend yourself against the enemy.  Revelation 12 verse 11 says, And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and the word of their testimony.  They overcame.  They overcame.  How did they overcome?  By the blood of the Lamb.  By the blood.  They overcame by the blood of the Lamb.  Jesus has already won the battle.  He has already overcome everything that can come your way.  At Calvary, He paid it all.  Not some, but all.  What does John 16 verse 33 say?  The things I have spoken to you, that in me you may have peace.  In the world you will have tribulation.  but be of good cheer.  i have overcome the world.  you see the blood of the lamb is a christian secret to victory but you need to apply it.  you need to apply the blood of jesus on your life.  no one can do it for you.  it is your obligation your responsibility and your duty to apply the blood of jesus over your own life.  now i'm not talking to you about applying the blood of jesus physically but spiritually.  In Exodus, the children of Israel were told to apply the blood on their doorposts, so that when the plague came, it would pass over them.  It wouldn't touch them.  And that is what you need to do.  We must apply the blood of Jesus so that whatever may come to harm us, will pass over us.  Because when it sees the blood of Jesus, whatever it is, it will know that this is a child of God.  I must leave them alone.  You see the blood of Jesus protects us.  There is power in the blood of Jesus.  Now imagine if the children of Israel had not applied the blood of Jesus on their doors.  Imagine if they had kept it locked up in a container in their house.  They would have been lost.  Yes the blood of Jesus has power.  But it is of no use to you if you don't apply it.  That's your job.  You must apply the blood of Jesus on your life.  There is power in the blood of Jesus.  There is protection in the blood of Jesus.  There is a covering that only the blood of Jesus can provide.  But only you can apply the blood of Jesus on your life, on your home.  I've only spoken about six different ways God protects us.  But God has an infinite number of ways he can protect us.  Believe in the protection of the Lord upon your life and your family's life. ",
