And again, there are some more videos coming very soon.  So today's episode of Go Ask Your Pastor is brought to you by Credibility.  And Nefernity won't have any once.  Zondervan responds to her accusation that they only said the Negroes are not from the line of Ham because Zondervan believed the racist ideology of the book written in 1900 called, what's it called?  The Negro, A Beast.  That's what it is, The Negro, A Beast.  She has made this accusation, and for those who have not seen the video that I dropped, Nefertiti and the Zondervan Bible Dictionary, please go watch that video.  I leave the contact information for Zondervan Academic and HarperCollins.  I'm asking everybody to call them and write them to get a concrete answer as to their ideology and whether or not they were following the ideology presented in The Negro, A Beast, written in 1900 when they published their dictionary in 1967 and we'll have our answer.  if they say yes that's what they're doing then they have to explain why in 2020 they're still publishing that and it's going to cause a ton of backlash or they have to throw nephronity under the bus as a liar and say that they had nothing to do with it.  either way this should get interesting if they give us an answer.  all right.  so go ask your pastor.  Go ask your pastor is a segment on my channel.  where i get your pastor to give up the ministry and go back and join a gang because gang banging is easier than answering these questions.  so for those of you who have not asked your pastor any of these just understand that it may get you kicked out of church and i do not say that just jokingly.  i do kind of say it jokingly.  but no some people have actually been kicked out of church for asking some of these questions to their pastor.  all right so today's information.  i've gone over it before but there have been a lot of new people to subscribe and also since I've been doing these go ask a pastor.  go ask your pastor.  videos.  I wanted to add this to this collection because these go over one piece of evidence at a time to make it easy to find what you're looking for and this particular piece of evidence seems to make the urban apologist mad so mad.  in fact the cherry love did it like a four-hour video and never actually touched any of the stuff that I pointed out that this man talks about.  so this guy right here is named sir harry johnston.  as you can see he is a european.  now one of the false narratives that is being pushed by some people in the christian community mainly the urban apologists is that we only believe this stuff because we're black and that we're misreading history and context.  well sir harry johnson is a racist a very openly racist man who was very very heavily involved in africa and this very openly racist man puts it very plainly in his openly racist book in which he talks about um human zoos and basically espouses the ideology from the negro a beast that was written in 1900. harry johnston's book was published in 1910 just 10 years after that and you can tell that he goes by some of the ideology presented in that book.  so now with that said let me point out some of his credentials.  he's an explorer he's a botanist he's a colonial administrator.  he actually brokered some treaties in Africa.  he was widely traveled in Africa.  he spoke multiple languages and he published 40 books about Africa.  so understand he was very familiar with Africans and what they look like.  he was very familiar with black people and what they look like even though he was a racist.  now understand that since he was a racist it means he did not like black people.  he did not think very highly of black people.  he thought black people were beasts.  this is important.  he was a very important player in the scramble for Africa.  basically the scramble for Africa was the European plan to divide Africa up among the European powers at the time and he was one of the key players in this historic event.  now in his book the Negro in the New World which is housed at the Smithsonian Institute he made some very interesting observations.  now remember he's a racist.  this is important.  he is a racist.  he does not like black people but he spent most of his time in Africa which meant he was very familiar with the black people and what they look like their languages their customs and their cultures.  So in his book, The Negro in the New World, this is a. this is a screenshot of the full page.  The link will be in the description so you can go through and read this for yourself.  This is page 26 and 27.  I'm going to read from page 27. this is important.  remember page 27. so when you go read it for yourself you can read this whole page.  he covers several things and I know the title says that the Jews had negroid features but he also points to several other interesting observations he made.  so page 27 as you can see here the picture is the same.  you're gonna see part of this picture as well so page 27.
