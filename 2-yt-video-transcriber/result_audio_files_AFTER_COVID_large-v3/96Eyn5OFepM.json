Because the bump stock, even the bump stock, is technically the the invention of a loophole.  a bump stock does not actually turn your semi-automatic rifle into a fully automatic rifle.  a bump stock uses the recoil so that it with the recoil push back it turns the trigger into basically a hair trigger or it.  it essentially uses the recoil of your shots to turn it into an automatic weapon.  it's not actually an automatic weapon it's still a semi-automatic weapon.  okay ban them.  it's a loophole.  ban them.  see how easy that was.  it's great Trump advocated to ban those.
