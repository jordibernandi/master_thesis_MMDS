            "text": "The narrative was always a lie, as it is with many of these people who end up being killed in police shootings.  The narrative is often a lie.  They tell us that Breonna Taylor was sleeping in her bed.  She was an emergency medical technician or a nurse.  The cops kicked the door in while she was sleeping and just shot her in cold blood.  Then we learned that wasn't true.  And actually, they were serving a warrant because her boyfriend was wanted for questioning or in connection with some other crimes.  And then they said, well, you know, they still fired at them, storming the door down in a no-knock raid.  Okay, then we learned it wasn't a no-knock raid.  Actually, they had a special provision.  After knocking several times and not getting a response, they kicked the door in.  They were then shot by the boyfriend of Breonna Taylor while they were both in the hall, Breonna Taylor and the boyfriend.  And the cops returned fire.  And Breonna Taylor got shot several times and died.  It's tragic.  It shouldn't have happened.  But sometimes these things happen.  I mean, what should we do if someone's accused of a crime, her boyfriend, and the cops are serving a warrant?  They knock.  No one answers.  And they storm in.  This guy shot these people who he didn't know were police.  The police said they announced themselves.  It's still a serious challenge because, you know, innocent until proven guilty.  I don't like the idea of the cops kicking my door in and me not knowing who they are.  And apparently they tried to go after Kenneth Walker, I believe his name is.  And they failed because you have a right to defend yourself in your home.  Anyway, now we know that, uh, you know, the story is actually much worse.  Well, there were some leaked documents recently that showed that Brandon Taylor wasn't just some innocent woman whose boyfriend was wrongly targeted.  In fact, documents that have been released show that there was reason to investigate her.  And, you know, the series of events that had unfolded as the police were serving a warrant were unfortunate, but this was not an innocent person just sleeping in their bed who was killed.  This was somebody who was still presumably innocent because innocent until proven guilty, who was killed in a shootout with police and who was wanted for questioning in relation to gun charges.  I'm sorry, drug charges.  Let me just read you the story so you have the general understanding.  Cops released photos that were tagged partners in crime from Brenna Taylor's boyfriend phone that show them both holding gun believed to be the one he used to fire at police, as messages also suggest he was selling drugs.  The Louisville Metro Police Department has released the contents of its internal investigation following the death of Brenna Taylor, including photos of her brandishing guns and text messages that indicate her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, sold drugs.  So let me just say it right there.  Why was there a warrant being served at Brenna Taylor's home?  because that's where Kenneth Walker was, and they believed he was selling drugs.  It's that simple.  It wasn't an incorrect warrant.  It wasn't a no-knock warrant.  And it's unfortunate that she lost her life, but this was investigation of a crime.  On Wednesday, LMPD released 4,470 pages, including investigative reports, interview summaries.  and evidence reports, as well as 251 videos and hundreds of photos.  Taylor's death and a hail of police bullets early on March 13th sparked protests nationwide, and the document dump follows a controversial grand jury ruling that saw no officers directly charged in their death.  Included in the new documents are photos of Taylor and Walker posing with guns, as well as text messages that strongly suggest that Walker was involved in the sale of illegal drugs.  Walker was a licensed gun owner able to legally carry in Kentucky.  He was not named in the search warrant used to enter Taylor's home, and he was not a target in the drug investigation of Taylor's ex-boyfriend, Jamarcus Glover, that led to the raid on the apartment.  So to clarify, it wasn't about her boyfriend at all, so I was wrong about that for sure.  Just her connection to her current and ex-boyfriend, I'd imagine, would be probable cause for some kind of investigation.  Partners in Crime reads the caption at the bottom of the photo, along with a cartoon of handcuffs.  In text messages, Walker said that he purchased the Glock from a white boy and that it wasn't registered to him, but he had a bill of sale.  In one text message to Walker, Taylor sent an image of herself with an AR-15 pistol.  In another, she asks for a picture of the AR-15 pistol to show to a white boy she works with who might be interested in purchasing it, according to new documents.  Here we can see that this is the image of the Glock that was used apparently to shoot at the police.  In the course of the investigation, police also recovered evidence that Walker was involved in the sale of drugs.  In police interviews, Walker said that he was not involved in serious criminal activity, but did say that he sometimes personally used marijuana.  However, a search of his phone found numerous conversations about drug trafficking, investigators said in the newly released documents.  In several chats described in the documents, Walker discusses selling pills to Hooters waitresses.  In another conversation, he sent an image of a bag of marijuana, advertising it as Cali High Grade Premium Cannabis 1LB, according to the documents.  In other messages, Walker offered to sell half ounces for $25 or two zips, slang for ounces, for $2.60, the documents state.  The messages with more than two dozen apparent customers span the fall of 2019 to March of this year, just prior to the raid.  In another group chat, Walker discussed robbing someone.  The documents state, Walker asked how much bread the target had, and another person replied that it was at least $25,000.  When someone in the chat asked if it was an easy target or whether they needed to do homework, Walker replied that he does his homework on every mission, according to the documents.  Brent Taylor's boyfriend told police they were scared to death when they heard banging on the door because they thought it was her drug dealing ex.  The new documents revealed the police insisted that they knocked and announced themselves.  But that Taylor's boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, said that they only heard the knocking and did not hear police identify themselves.  Walker said the couple was scared to death because they feared it was her drug dealing ex-boyfriend.  He opened fire down a hallway at the door as the door was breached, striking one officer in the leg and cops returned fire.  It wasn't just the officer's leg, however.  It was the femoral artery, which is a kill shot.  I'm not saying he was trying to kill the officer, but that's a lethal hit.  Fortunately, they applied first aid.  The officer survived.  Cops believe Taylor's home was the money house where Glover housed the dope, the documents state.  But no significant amounts of drugs or money were found there.  And investigators later raised questions about the evidence used to tie Glover to Taylor's home.  Sure.  It seems like they reasonably believed that she may be storing things for her ex-boyfriend.  Maybe they didn't realize she was dating somebody else.  And we can see from her boyfriend, the document suggests that he wasn't up to any good either.  But look, innocent until proven guilty.  And therein lies the bigger problem.  While I think this shows that, first of all, she shouldn't have died.  I mean, that's messed up.  But it wasn't that they were searching her home for no reason.  There's reason to believe that crimes were being committed.  But as nobody was convicted of any crimes, then as far as I'm concerned, innocent.  Ultimately, what this means is the cops seem to have been acting in good faith.  And this was just a tragic and unfortunate sequence of events.  The cops were knocking on the door to serve a warrant, as they need to do.  And this individual was seeing someone break into his house, Kenneth Walker, and fired in defense.  And then shots were fired back and Breonna Taylor lost her life.  The point of this segment is the narrative tends to be lies.  Hands up, don't shoot.  That was a lie, right?  We know from the AG report that Michael Brown didn't have his hands up.  He was attacking the cop.  In this instance, it wasn't some random innocent woman killed in her bed.  That's just not true.  And her boyfriend didn't even say that was the case.  But it's propaganda.  The left pushes the narrative and the narrative persists.  And then people hearing that the cops just killed this innocent woman become extremists.  And that's the point.  Radicalization.  Then you have cops being antagonized and attacked.  People say defund the police.  They lose their funding.  And this results in more anger and animosity towards police and ill-equipped and angry and and.  you know, anxious police officer, then falls into harsher circumstances.  And the left is creating a downward spiral where more of these tragic incidents may occur.  If you have low morale, scared police, you're going to end up with more panic situations and more death.  And then the left will claim, aha, see, this proves it.  And they will continue to try and dissolve, abolish or disband the police, which is just, I mean, it's just absolutely insane.  They say Taylor's name came up in the drug case, at least in part because she had posted bail a few times from 2017 to January 2020 to Glover and another defendant, Darryl Forest, in amounts that went as high as $5,000, according to the police files released Wednesday.  Not true.  That's not true, Daily Mail.  You are wrong on that one.  It was a standard warrant with a special provision that they could breach the door should no one answer.  A no-knock warrant means specifically they run in, smash the door down, and storm in the building.  They announce themselves.  At least they say they do.  Innocent until proven guilty.  I can only take them at their word.  Walker, believing it was an intruder, fired at the officers, prompting them to return fire and kill Taylor.  He was charged with attempted murder.  However, the charges were later dropped.  Walker has maintained the officers did not identify themselves as police when they arrived at the apartment.  I believe him.  I believe he didn't hear them.  Put it better.  Because I don't think he would have shot at cops if he knew it was police.  He probably would have backed off.  The problem with this is what if some criminal just yells police?  I mean, they're a criminal.  They're trying to hurt you.  What do you do?  Criminals probably know they can say this.  In fact, when it comes to con artists, they know authority is one of the most powerful tools in, you know, getting what they want.  And they can straight up tell you that they're a cop because they don't care about the consequences.  They're committing crimes.  This is probably why Walker ultimately was not facing any serious charges.  Or I should say that the charges were dropped because a reasonable person would defend their home in this circumstance.  The point I want to make with this Don't believe the leftist propaganda.  I'm not here to say that it was her fault or to defend the police.  Not at all.  I'm saying from the facts we have from CNN's reporting, you know, in other segments, it was just a tragic and unfortunate turn of events.  And there's real reason they were investigating this individual.  Maybe it wasn't good enough.  Sure.  What do we do?  I think reform is a solution, but I'm not going to pretend to know what the actual, you know, what the actual reform would be because I don't think I'm smart enough and know what these cops go through or what homeowners should be able to do in the event of some kind of, you know, some person storming into your house.  But I'll leave it there.  Next segment's coming up in a few minutes.  Stick around and I will see you all shortly.  Thank you. ",
