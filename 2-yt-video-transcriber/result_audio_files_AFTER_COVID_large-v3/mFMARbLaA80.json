            "text": "My video for June the 12th, 2020 is video number 3,483.  The title is The Resurrection of a Dead Man.  A quick glance at the title and one might think I am talking about the Bible story of Jesus of Nazareth.  That's not what this is about.  It's about actors.  How many times have you watched a movie in which a character is killed?  Haven't we all?  It's been commonplace in our culture for decades.  Of course, movies are a form of mind control and it works.  At least these stories cause emotional responses.  The masters of deception know this and use it to their advantage against all of us.  We've all been deceived.  Is this life real?  were just a play to entertain the gods at the expense of us actors.  I just got this from a Facebook friend, quote, I've silently followed you for a decade plus.  I've heard you, watched your very early morning casts.  Some bits I loved, some not so much.  But in the end, I totally respect and love you.  This is truth, brother, end quote.  My truth is, I'm tired of the emotional yo-yo.  It may be time to reinvent myself as a resurrected dead man.  After all, George Floyd is already back as his newly created twin brother.  I chuckle, but I seriously am questioning whether I should continue these daily videos.  I've been doing it for a long time.  day after day after day.  And quite honestly, it's getting tiring.  I have a friend that keeps telling me the RV is imminent.  Uh, it's, it's going to happen this weekend.  Now, you know, it's going to be this weekend.  Uh, but of course I've been hearing that for over four years.  It's always imminent and never happens.  That's true of a lot of the promises that I believe, including the ones about the return of Jesus of Nazareth.  Coming back as the King of Kings and Lord of Lords and not just a suffering servant.  That's the story I was raised on.  But again, it's just part of a fairy tale.  It's a fiction.  I know there's lots of Bible believers out there.  That I've been told.  it's the truth.  This is the real truth.  I believed it too.  That's why I read the Bible so often.  Like I've said in so many of my videos.  Every day.  Every day.  And I'd read it through every year.  Every year.  Twice.  I read it through twice in a single year.  Twice.  I did that.  I grew up.  And I also grew up with movies in which I saw the heroes shot and killed on the TV screen.  Yeah, we didn't get TV right away.  It was a sin initially, but finally, like everybody else, we got a TV in our house.  It was a little one, you know, maybe, maybe a foot wide.  Uh, I remember it was flat on the top and bottom of the screen and, Rounded on the edges.  Little black and white TV.  Now they have TVs that are monsters.  It's like bringing a movie theater into your house.  I don't have one of those, but I do have a larger screen TV.  What is it?  I don't know.  27 inches maybe.  I'm not sure.  In any case, folks, the point that I'm trying to make besides the fact that I'm frustrated is that almost everything that we're being shown on the TV screens and in the news media and everything is lies.  George Floyd was a crisis actor and that's why he can come back as his newly created twin brother.  Of course, it's no longer George, right?  He'll go by a different name.  But I've watched videos of some of these major events that happened.  And the same people that were used to create an emotional response from the public, from John Q. Public, or Jane Q. Public, those very things were used to manipulate us.  Because everything is a deception.  Jeffrey Doherty, you know, was a Christian whistleblower.  That's what he's known as.  I've watched many of his videos.  And a lot of it makes sense now.  I would have totally rejected it at an earlier time in my life because I was a true believer.  And we have lots of true believers out there.  True believers in what?  True believers in what we've been told.  That we have no way of proving by personal experience.  No way of verifying because we have tested it and tried it and found it to be true.  I have a test for God.  And I keep bringing it up every single day.  Many times, most days, many times.  God, I want your attention.  Will you please listen to me?  I have numb feet.  It's been going on for over four years.  I want my feet healed.  I will notice it immediately.  Immediately.  Do you think God answers that prayer?  No.  God is totally silent.  I cry out, God, I want to talk to you.  Make yourself real to me.  Do you think God makes himself real to me?  Not a bit.  Not a bit.  Have I become a backslider, as some of my Christian friends, including my ex-wife, say?  That I'm going to hell because I speak the truth?  Because I speak the truth of what?  Not truth that I've been indoctrinated with, but truth that I experience on a day-to-day basis.  That is truth.  Some say, no, Ron, it's just an illusion.  The real truth, as my friend Steve says, the real truth is in a higher dimension.  Okay, well, let's bring the higher dimension and merge it with the lower dimension so that we can really have heaven on earth, peace on earth.  But peace isn't profitable to the charlatans that have been running things for a long time.  Why does a loving God allow charlatans to run worlds anywhere?  It doesn't matter where.  We're on Earth right now, a planet called Earth.  It's a beautiful planet, but they are polluting everything.  They, who are they?  Well, they are us in a deceived state, in an unawakened state, in a state where we haven't a clue what it's all about.  But of course, the demons, they apparently have a clue, right?  And they know it's just a play.  And they can drink our energy and siphon our energy off through emotional responses to the play, the drama, the murders, the mayhem.  And it's happening again and again.  When are we going to wake up?  George Floyd was not killed by that policeman who wasn't a policeman.  and neither were some of the other actors in the drama.  It was a staged event.  Everything that we're seeing in the mainstream media is pretty much staged events, staged responses, and people are marching and rioting and tearing down buildings, and the police are coming in or at least uniformed people looking like police, are coming in and they're putting rocks and in some cases bricks to break windows and to smash little local businesses.  Why?  Because there's an agenda.  And we're not part of that agenda if we're speaking the truth.  The agenda is about control.  It's about letting the liars win.  and all of us believing lies and allowing the world to go to hell.  Thank you folks for listening and Namaste. ",
