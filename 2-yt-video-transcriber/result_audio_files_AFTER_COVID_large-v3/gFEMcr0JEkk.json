            "text": "Thank you.  All right.  I had a few of my subs say that I wasn't giving out enough fear porn and I was sorely slacking.  So I would like to humbly say forgive me, subs, for it's been a week since I have given out any substantial fear porn.  And I'm going to make that right starting now.  Now, this is something I've been waiting to get to for a while.  I've kind of put it off for other things because it was off in the distance.  But this is like the end of June and in July.  A lot of these moratoriums that we had starting in March are going to be.  gone which is the moratorium on evictions.  so i've been collecting these here and there and this is the first story now.  this one is back in the beginning of april.  so to give you a slightly historical view of how this stuff started okay a massive wave of evictions is coming.  temporary bans won't help.  this is coming from the washington Post, before the novel coronavirus struck, 300,000 evictions were filed in the United States in a typical month.  With nearly 10 million people filing unemployment claims last month, evictions would clearly skyrocket.  Absent intervision from the government and one hint of the trouble to come, researchers at the City University of New York found at the end of March that 44% of New Yorkers expected to have trouble making their April rent.  Fortunately, Congress states municipalities and the Department of Housing and Urban Development have all have stepped up to issue temporary bans on eviction.  That's good news, but there are significant limits to many of these bans, and even the best of them are temporary.  In many places, for instance, landlords are still filing eviction papers.  even when there is a freeze on ejecting people from their homes.  And not every state has imposed such a freeze.  Without a stronger state and federal response, the United States appears headed toward an unprecedented housing crisis.  We at the Eviction Lab, based at Princeton University in partnership with Columbia, visiting law professor Emily Benfer, have been tracking when and how state and federal eviction policies are changing.  We've found clear fault lines in current policies to prevent people from becoming homeless during the crisis.  The coronavirus relief bill passed last month by Congress prohibits foreclosure on federally backed mortgage loans for 60 days.  Now, a lot of these 60 days bands are up already.  This was April 8th.  This was 1st of April when they filed them.  And it was up in the 1st of June.  So by July, it should be July 1st.  You see a lot of these things coming back.  Covering some 30 million homeowners, the bill also prohibits rental evictions for 120 days for property secured by a government-backed mortgage.  that covers about half of all multifamily homes.  Beyond that, however, protections for renters tend to be haphazard, varying widely by state.  as of this past weekend policies are changing quickly.  only 14 states have barred landlords from formally beginning the process of eviction.  according to our data 36 plus the district of columbia still permit evictions to be filed.  the district of columbia interesting.  Many of these states are in effect simply delaying hearings, typically for 60 or 90 days or until the state's emergency declaration lifts.  What's more, only 21 states and D.C.  have halted the execution of eviction orders issued before the coronavirus outbreak turned into a major health crisis.  In the remaining states, a family legally evicted in February could be physically evicted today.  13 states, including Florida, Nevada, Mississippi, Ohio, South Dakota, Utah, Vermont, and Wyoming, allow cities and towns to set their own eviction policies.  some cities miami is notable example have responded by issuing moratoriums but suburban and rural communities have been much slower to act.  the problem is that housing insecurity affects communities large and small across the country.  in fact some rural towns have eviction rates that rival the highest evicting cities.  in some cases states have placed bureaucratic hurdles between renters and the protections that have been passed.  arizona california florida kansas maryland new mexico nebraska and utah all require tenants to demonstrate they've been affected by a virus outbreak, either the disease itself or the mandatory business closures, before they're shielded from eviction.  While there is little guidance on how to prove you've been affected by the outbreak, states could require tenants to contest an eviction order in court by demonstrating job termination or presenting unemployment filings.  which are backlogged as is.  But since most courts are closed to in-person hearings, the path forward is murky.  The crisis has struck the United States at a moment when millions of people were already living furiously close to eviction.  Because of stagnant wages and rising rents, one out of four renters spent over half of their income on housing.  Among rent-burdened households, defined as those that spend more than one-third of their income on housing, Half have less than $10 in savings.  Wow.  Wow.  This is not going to be good.  Listen to this.  Nearly a third of the American workforce, some 41.7 million people, earn less than $12 per hour.  Let that sink in.  Let that sink in.  Nearly a third of the American workforce, some 41.7 million people, earn less than $12 an hour and has limited access to health care, paid sick days, and paid family and medical leave, mandatory stay-at-home orders, and forced closings of business will force much of this population, even with the help of unemployment insurance, to choose between paying rent or buying groceries.  That's what your stimulus was for.  Some landlords have delayed eviction and even canceled rent for their tenants.  Others, however, have been less sympathetic.  The Daily Beast recently reported on the case of a Las Vegas nurse who was evicted because her landlord worried she might potentially spread COVID-19.  The problem is simply too consequential to be left up to landlord discretion.  And if evictions are merely delayed, not permanently stopped, that could lead to a resurgence of the virus after a stay-at-home measure has been the curve of infections.  Evicted families end up in homeless shelters where people eat, sleep next to each other, the opposite of social distancing.  People experiencing homelessness are particularly vulnerable to upper respiratory illness including COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.  Well before the pandemic, sprawling tent encampments had experienced outbreaks of medieval diseases such as typhus and trench fever.  Okay.  okay skipping down.  if federal and state leaders do not act swiftly to patch all the holes in their eviction policies the nation's biggest public health crisis in a century could easily cause a full-blown outbreak of homelessness.  in these trying times eviction will not help landlords get paid.  it will only spread yet more poverty, sickness, and death.  That is very true.  I've heard up to at least, not at least, at the top end, it could be up to 30% of people that get evicted or have potential evictions.  They can't pay their mortgage or their rent.  And if 40 some odd million people are out of work and you can't bring all these people back into work, 20 million units empty within a matter of months or years, The home foreclosures, we haven't even talked about home foreclosures yet and how that's going to impact the banks.  So this is a potential tsunami.  And this is something that nobody wants to talk about for obvious reasons, because what we're dealing with on the streets is protests and riots and stuff like that.  But this is being pushed to the background.  The first order was feeding these people.  That's what the food banks are for.  That's what the stimulus checks were for, is to get people fed because that's the immediate need.  The eviction moratoriums because of the courts, because of the policies that were set forth to delay, not stop, but delay evictions.  Okay, that's going to come to an end.  That's already starting to come to an end.  In July, we're going to see a rash of these things.  So hold on to your hats.  You ain't seen nothing yet.  Because if you thought that the economy was already impacted, wait, just wait till these moratoriums were lifted.  They've been keeping people in a bubble and people are starting to feel secure, even though they hate being cooped up inside.  Wait till this bad boy hits.  And whether it's a Katie bar the door or whoa, Nelly, or whatever term you want to use, it's going to get messy.  Even if a fraction of these people get evicted, it's going to get messy.  Can you imagine in a given city like Los Angeles or New York or dc or miami or even uh points in texas chicago a hundred thousand people be dumped being dumped on the street within a matter of what a week?  there are no shelters tents or available housing to house a hundred thousand people in a particular city and that's just probably the low end.  So as far as fear porn is concerned, this is just one of your little black swans getting ready to land on your yard.  So like I said, pray to your God of understanding.  Pray that COVID-19 does not get worse.  Because if it does and they dump these people on the street, y'all ain't seen nothing yet.  You guys have not seen anything yet.  But anyway, I hope that serves as your daily dose of fear porn.  i got about oh good god i got about at least three four maybe five more of these things.  so i'll be dropping them over the period of the uh week or so interspersed with other little doodads and and tidbits of other fear porn.  so you're gonna get your jollies but with that i'm gonna jump off here.  this is bgs out and i'll see you guys on the next one.
