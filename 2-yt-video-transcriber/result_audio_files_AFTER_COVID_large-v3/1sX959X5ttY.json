There's a video I just posted on my channel three days ago.  It's got almost 100,000 views with someone that refused me service because I was conducting a constitutionally protected activity.  And that's what's going to happen here today.  So because he said he contacted the police, we're going to wait for them.  And I'm going to wait until I get my stamp.  How much you guys want to bet I'm going to get a stamp today?  And thank God we're recording this so they can't make anything up.  All right.  And here's the thing that they won't learn.  I could have came in, bought a stamp, and been out of here, and we would be gone.  So guys, I can only buy a stamp if I do not practice my constitutional liberties.  That's the only way I can buy a stamp today.  Is if I sacrifice my liberty for security.  It's the only way.  Here's a little story, guys.  In the early to mid-1950s, there were some folks that were refused service, violating their civil rights.  I thought we were well behind those times.  I guess they refused service.  Aaron Randolph.  Can I just buy a stamp so we can get out of here, man?  Just one. ",

We've been here 20 minutes.  The first question we asked was, can we buy a stamp?  And then they kind of had a meltdown.  Yeah, so it just states that for news and media purposes, we can film in the foyers, public lobbies.  The only exemption is for other purposes, which is commercial use.  So we would have a movie.  We would have to make an appointment because then we would technically have to privately contract or they would have to notify citizens and stuff like that.  If it's just for news purposes or anyone wants to come in here and exercise their First Amendment right, then they are limited to the public law using force.  You obviously can't go back there.  But yeah, I mean, and the sign, like if it said we couldn't, then it would really, any law that is unconstitutional in itself is unlawful.
