            "text": "Yes.  I'd like to say that I was unique.  The Gallup poll came out that showed that actually about 1 in 25 people claimed to have an NDE.  And I was one of the skeptics.  A near-death experience, I thought, was either chemically induced, imagined, or something thereof.  So I was skeptical until I had my own.  And at one point, we were on top of the world in my business career.  I was out in Washington, D.C.  We were introducing an Alzheimer's drug.  We were on the front cover of Time magazine and on all of the major networks to introduce a drug that would be a possible cure for Alzheimer's.  Well, there were a series of events that caused us to lose that drug and FDA recall and then other things were happening to cause us some financial stress and I was sitting in a coffee shop with my wife drowning our sorrows in lattes.  and so I said well at least we have our health.  and about two weeks later i flew out uh... for an interview with the company health care company and came back and i felt the heaviness in my calf uh... it wouldn't go away.  i thought it was a strain.  i had been exercising bicycling But it continued to swell about almost one and a half times its size.  So I thought, well, we were planning a trip after a lot of stress to go in the San Joaquin Mountains in Colorado and such.  So I thought I'd go to the orthopedic surgeon and just get an anti-inflammatory drug.  And I was rushed to the ER.  And at that point, they found through the CAT scan and through the ultrasound and such that the D-dimer, which is a coagulant indicator in the blood, was high, that I had six blood clots.  And so they had started in the calf, which is why the swelling.  They had traveled all the way up the leg.  to the pulmonary artery, which is the main airway to the lungs.  And so that blocked my ability to breathe.  I had a respirator then at that point to help me breathe.  And the only other option was to transport me to a center where there was a trained surgeon to open the chest, remove the clot, and it was determined that by the time I got to the center in San Diego that it would be too long and I would be dead.  So a heparin drip, drip, drip, drip.  And that continued for a number of hours as I struggled to breathe.  At the same time, there was an IV that was placed in my arm, and then that became infected.  So on top of having the pulmonary embolism, I had an infection, and I became septic.  with MRSA, one of the most drug resistant types of bacteria.  So that caused a state of what is called hypercoagulability, which is I was clotting now throughout my body and the doctor had tried to remove some blood from my arm, wasn't able to do so.  And he said, well, this is strange.  And so it was like a traffic jam throughout my body with the roads being arteries in this case.  So it was at that point that not only could I not breathe from the blocked airway, but also I was in septic shock.  And I started going into convulsions.  And at that point, everything went dark.  I was... Immediately, my wife tells me.  I can't cry during this segment because the event is so strikingly real.  Sure, sure.  That immediately I was in a place that was dark to light to lighter.  There was a light that was coming down that I couldn't look at directly because of its brightness.  I could see in the distance these spiritual beings.  I didn't know what to make of it.  And I kept rising above.  I could see my body below for a period of time, but then I was rising.  And at that point where I settled, there was a soft, and this is the part that's hard.  There was a soft body that was next to me.  And I was literally cheek to cheek with this person.  and I felt comfort beyond anything I had ever experienced in my entire life.  And the first thought that came to mind Tom was, so this is love.  So this is love.  And it took a while for me to turn because I didn't want to leave that place of comfort.  And I turned to look and Jesus And I knew instantly it was Jesus without him having to say anything to me.  His eyes tunneled through me in all the dark places.  He saw me in the way I've never been seen on earth by anybody because he saw everything about me.  And I was in his presence and I dropped and I was in awe of the Lord Jesus Christ.  And I wanted to stay there.  And I just, we didn't have to talk initially because he knew what I was thinking.  I knew that.  He knew.  And I was just immersed in his presence with a peace I had never felt before. ",

Because I was in the presence of the Lord, and he had all of it in control.  Thank you, God.  I didn't even initially want to look around because the only thing I wanted to be was in the presence of Jesus.  That's right, that's right. ",

And I felt like an audience of one.  I felt like I was the only one.  I knew the cares of the world were upon him, but I felt like his undivided attention was exclusively on me.  And that was probably one of the most overwhelming senses with the Lord, was that the human mind, I know this from my business and training people, as a form of scattered thinking.  At any time?  we're thinking about perhaps dozens of other things.  And that was the first time that I sensed that Jesus' attention was solely focused on me.  There were no distractions, nothing.  And I was the only thing that he was thinking about and knowing at that time.  And it was absolutely incredible. ",

I was one who not only disliked Christians, you know, they're hypocrites and those typical arguments.  I had a disdain for Christians in general.  So I had studied the truth at Northwestern University earlier in my life.  I worked with a bunch of brainiacs, technicians.  There was a computer there.  We plugged in to disprove all religions, including Christianity.  And so we plugged in all of the data points, and I'm not a techie.  but they were and so we were able to refute all of the other religions besides Christianity as a fusion of beliefs or a single individual who espoused a certain way.  But the God of the Bible was validated through a corroboration of ancient documents that I chronicle that research in technical terms. ",
