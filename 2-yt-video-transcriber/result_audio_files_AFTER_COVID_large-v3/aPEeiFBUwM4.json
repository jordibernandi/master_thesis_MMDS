            "text": "We can no longer continue to make policy for ourselves, in our country, in our region, in our continent, on the basis of whatever support the Western world or France or the European Union can give us.  It will not work.  It has not worked and it will not work.  Our responsibility is to charter a path which is about how we can develop our nations ourselves.  It is not right for a country like Ghana, 60 years after independence, to still have its health and education budgets being financed on the basis of the generosity and charity of European taxpayers.  By now, we should be able to finance our basic needs, ourselves.  Our perspective has not to be what the French taxpayer decides to do with whatever surpluses that they have in France.  They're welcome.  But this continent, with all that has happened, is still today the repository of at least 30% of the most important minerals of the world.  It's a continent of vast arable and fertile lands.  It has the youngest population of any of the continents in the world.  So it has the energy and the dynamism.  We've seen it.  These young men who are showing so much resilience and and ingenuity in crossing the Sahara, finding ways to go across with rickety boats across the Mediterranean.  Those energies, we want to have those energies working inside our countries.  And we're going to have those energies working in our countries if we begin to build systems that tell the young people of our country that their hopes, their opportunity, are right here with us.  Migration and the movement of people is being presented in a manner which suggests that somehow it's a new phenomenon.  There's nothing new about it.  It's as old as man, the movement of people.  And it has always been linked to the same thing.  The failure of where you are to provide you with an opportunity so you move somewhere else.  Those of you who are familiar with 19th century European history would know that the biggest wave of immigration in 19th century Europe, the latter part of it, came from Ireland and from Italy.  Waves upon waves, generations of Italians and the Irish people left their countries to seek the American paradise, largely because Ireland was not working.  Italy was not working.  Today, you don't hear it.  Italian young people are in Italy.  Irish young people are in Ireland.  We want young Africans to stay in Africa.  And how are they... And it means that we have to get away from this mindset of dependence, this mindset about what can France do for us.  France will do whatever it needs to do for its own sake.  And when those coincide with ours, ,, as the French people say.  But our main responsibility as leaders, as citizens, is what we need to do to grow our own countries.  Our concern should be with what do we need to do in this 21st century to move Africa away from being cap in hand and begging for aid, for charity, for handouts, The African continent, when you look at its resources, should be giving monies to other places.  We have huge wealth on this continent.  So with the greatest of respect to the French president, I think that the cooperation of France is something that I am, as you know, a strong friend of France.  I am Francophile.  So I don't have any difficulty with that.  But I'm talking about our own propulsion, what we need to do to get our countries to work so that we can create the conditions that would allow our young people to forego this hazardous effort to get to Europe.  They're not going there because they want to.  They're going there because they don't believe they have any opportunities in our countries.  So that should be our focus.  And I believe that with that, if we change that mindset, that mindset of dependence, that mindset which is contingent on aid and charity, we would see that in the decades ahead of us, the full flowering of the African peoples would take place.  And that new African personality that was talked about at the time of our independence will become real and imminent in our times.  That's what I'm saying.  I hope that I'm not upsetting the questioner or even some of my friends who are here.  But these are my strongly held beliefs.  And that is the reason why I've adopted as the slogan of my presidency, of my period in the Supreme Office of Ghana, that we want to build a Ghana beyond age.  A Ghana which is independent, which is self-sufficient, that is capable of standing on its own feet and building its own life.  We can do it.  I'm a king.  Yes, I'm a king.  I'm a king. ",
