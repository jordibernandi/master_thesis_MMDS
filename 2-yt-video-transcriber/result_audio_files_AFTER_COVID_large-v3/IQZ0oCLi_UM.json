            "text": "Can you tell her to stop harassing us, please?  No, no, no, no, no.  You say defund the police.  Don't you dare ask the police for help.  Turn your poster around.  Turn your poster around.  The other side says defund blue terrorists and she's asking the police for help.  We're here in Jupiter, Florida at the Trump Boat Parade where there are the first ever protesters I've seen at a Trump Boat Parade.  You'll find that they support defunding the police but are standing near the police for protection asking them to keep me away from them because I have a lot of questions to ask.  Hi guys, we're documenting what's going on with the Trump Boat Parade and some people said that you were protesters.  Would you... Would you guys label yourselves as protesters?  Would you guys label yourself as protesters like they're calling you?  We're not talking to you.  Why not?  Because we don't want to.  Okay, is it fun being racist?  Are you a Democrat?  I'm not talking to you.  I assume that you're a Democrat.  What is the definition of racism?  Why do you think these people are racist?  I'm not talking to you.  Why not?  You have nothing to back up what you're saying.  I do not want to talk to you.  Why would you call people racist?  Amazing.  I know you do.  I know you follow me.  Thank you for the following.  I do not follow you.  Trump.  Black Lives Matter.  It's amazing.  that you have specifically a race on your poster here, singling out a single race because you support them more, I guess, than the other ones.  And then you say, is it fun being racist?  Well, you hold up a racist terrorist organization.  I'm going to ask you, is it fun being racist?  I'm not talking to you.  You sit here and you chant and you have signs saying Black Lives Matter.  It's a racist terrorist organization.  Yet you sit there and you're going to ask other people why they're racist?  Really?  I really am interested, though, guys.  If you guys know what you stand for, why can't you tell me what you stand for?  Very simple.  Very simple.  If you think people are racist, you should be able to tell them why.  If you're going to call people racist, I think you should back that up.  So why is Trump racist if he has the lowest ever black unemployment rate?  He kills them.  I'm sorry?  He kills them.  He kills who?  Black people.  Trump kills black people?  Yeah, he allows police to kill black people.  So Trump kills black people?  Without consequence, yes.  Where is there no consequences at?  Breonna Taylor's cops that killed her are not arrested.  How is that Trump's fault?  Because he can do something about it.  How is that Trump's fault?  Move along.  Can you tell her to stop harassing us, please?  No, no, no, no, no.  You say defund the police.  Don't you dare ask the police for help.  Turn your poster around.  Turn your poster around.  The other side says defund blue terrorists and she's asking the police for help.  You might want to talk to your politicians.  You support fascism.  What is fascism?  If he's a fascist, why don't you want to talk to me?  But you'll yell at him calling him a fascist.  What is a fascist?  You just called that man a fascist.  Please, I'm not talking to you.  You're going to call people fascist and racist.  You're going to accuse Trump of killing black people.  When has Trump killed a black person?  Don't watch the fake news.  No answers.  You guys are accusing the president of killing people based on their skin color.  And you can't back that up or give me any examples.  I'm going to assume that they have no proof that Trump has killed a black person or anybody as a matter of fact.  But I do know that the organizations they have on their signs, Black Lives Matter, has killed people.  They have definitely killed people because of their skin color, because of their ideology.  Where do you have it on here that black lives?  They are in prison.  They are in prison for killing people.  And white cops that have killed black people are not.  White cops that have killed black people are not in prison.  Do you know about our justice system?  Do you know that there has to be a trial by our peers to be convicted of these things?  Where has someone?  That's just murder.  That is just murder.  That is just murder.  Black on black murder is just murder.  Oh my God.  They're ignorant, but you're calling people racist.  How many black unarmed people, black unarmed men have been shot by the police in 2019?  How many?  We're not talking to you.  How many?  Why do you keep putting your microphone in our face?  How many?  If you think black people are out here just dying all over the streets by cops, how many unarmed black men were killed by the police?  How many?  Those kids don't count.  I forgot.  There were nine unarmed black men killed by the police last year.  And we tear our cities down for that.  Two found unjustified, and they were being held accountable for that.  What more do you guys want besides all of our money, besides abortions on demand?  And you laugh about it because you know it's true.  It's not true, so you don't support abortions.  That's not what I said.  You said you don't like it.  How many unarmed white men were killed in 2019 by the police?  19.  That's 10 more than black people.  Why do you not have White Lives Matter on your signs?  Have you ever protested for Duncan Limp?  Do you even know his name?  You shout the names of drug addicts, of criminals, people involved in drug trafficking, raping people.  You support rapists.  I'm not talking to you.  You support a rapist.  Who?  Who do I support?  that's a rapist?  Who do I support?  that's a rapist?  I'm glad you guys have your mask on.  Really, really protecting you guys out here.  I do like that.  you guys asked the police for help when you have defund the police signs on.  So I'm going to give you one last chance out here.  Are these people racist?  Well, we know that they think they are, but they have nothing to back it up.  All right, guys, I don't think you guys are racist.  I don't think you guys are racist.  I would never call you guys racist.  That's amazing.  That includes blacks.  Yeah, we're the racists.  Yeah, they support an organization based solely on someone's race who has been committing hate crimes around the country for more than 100 days.  Yeah, we're the racists.  We're the racists.  That's amazing.  Black Lives Matter has said that they want to destroy the nuclear family.  That's right.  They're anti-Christian.  They're pro-abortion.  How does that help the black community?
