She doesn't seem to know the First Amendment.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Do you?  I don't know.  If she touches someone with a camera, that's assault.  So, guys, I'm here at the Boston Medical Center.  Where's my staff?  Down here at the set of lights right there.  So this is the Boston Medical Center.  This is shipping and receiving.  As you see it says, no trespassing.

So until you swear at me, I can swear at you?  What are you talking about?  It makes no sense.  Stop talking to me.  No, you're not.  You're telling me to move off the public sidewalk.  Yes, you are.  You told me to keep moving.  You told me to keep moving, right?  Did you not?  Did you not?  Did you not?  Did you not?  Did you not?  I'm not yelling at you.

No.  You can tell her to back off and tell me to stop moving off of public sidewalk.  She doesn't seem to know the First Amendment.  Oh, I'm sorry, do you?  Yeah, I do, actually.  I do this for a living.  I do this for a living.  Go ahead.  Go ahead where?  See?  I don't have to move.  You can't record people at the hospital.  Yes, I can.  Yes, I can.  Yes, I can.  If I'm in public, yes, I can.  Yeah, okay.  Call the cops, because I'm not moving.  I don't understand why you're taking a video of everyone.  Why?  Because I'm documenting what's going on right now.  That's why.  That's simple.  Okay, but I'm asking you to stop recording.  First Amendment.  I don't care what you're asking.  Don't walk up to a camera.  That's fine.  What's your name?  Doesn't matter.  What's your name?  Exactly, so we don't have to answer to you.  Don't.  Yeah, you're asking me unlawful orders.  That's what you're asking.  Call the cops if you've got a problem with it.  I'm not moving.  They need to put up privacy screens.  You can see them taking care of patients right in there.  Sergeant, you might want to train her better on the First Amendment.  Thank you, sir.  All right, no problem.  You have a good day.  Can I get your name and badge?  My name is Sergeant David O'Brien.  Thank you.  She's very unprofessional.  Can I get her last name, please?  Turner.  Turner?  Yes.  Thank you.  Okay.  Appreciate it.  She doesn't seem to know the First Amendment.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Do you?  Thank you.  Yeah, that's what you're supposed to do, ma'am.  Turner.  5242.  All right, sir.  Have a good day.  Thank you.  If you don't like your job, ma'am, quit.  She's in shame right now.  She's sitting in her vehicle, just sitting there all shamed out.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Yeah, I want to force her out.  I knew it.  Couldn't even look my way.  Shameful.  Absolutely shameful.  Good old drive of shame, people.  Drive of shame.  Alright guys, I'm going to try to talk to the sergeant one more time.  If I don't get that, this will be the end of the video.  Much love, respect, and appreciation.  Hey sergeant, I just wanted to... I explained to them that you have every right to do what you're doing on the public sidewalk.  You can film all day.  You can zoom in.  You have every right as long as you're on the sidewalk.  I explained to them they weren't... They didn't understand that.  Showed me, I don't know how they are.  Yeah, I understand how they're thinking and the HIPAA and all this.  Exactly.  I get that you understand that.  And I explained that, you know, freedom of speech.  And she came out a little aggressive, so I was like, ma'am, ma'am, no.  But what I would suggest is along the sidewalk, Put something up.  I told them that.  And then with Turner, she came and tried to grab my camera and everything.  I apologize.  I would just let her know.  I'm surprised, to be honest.  She told me to keep moving off the sidewalk, and she told me she was medical staff, and she can't be recorded because of HIPAA.  That's incorrect.  I'm like, that has nothing.  You know that.  Yeah, exactly.  So I will remind our offices that.  All right, cool.  You're in public, you can follow me all day long, you can, whatever.  And I know you know that.  Yeah, and I told her, like, it's my first amendment.  She's like, you can't record us?  I'm like, I can, I do this for a living.  She's like, we'll see, we'll see.  I'm like, all right.  No, no, mass accountability.  Oh, okay, I watch videos.  Oh, cool, cool, yeah, yeah.  Continue what you're doing.  I try to be like this.  It makes us more knowledgeable.  Exactly.  As a group.  And I try to be respectful and actually have conversation and dialogue.  Yeah, yeah.  All right, man.  Appreciate it, man.  Yeah, no problem.  And turn it.  Let her know.  If she touches someone's camera, that's assault.  I got you.  That's battery.  And I'm sure you know that, too.  But just let her know, like, someone could take it more serious, you know.  All right, man.  Have a good one.  All right.  I hope I just got all that.  Do you want my card or anything?  I'll take it if you have one.  Yeah, why not?  I really appreciate the professionalism.  I'll give you a chance to give you a card.  You got any questions?  You want one of my cards?  Yeah, sure.  I'll give you my cell phone, too.  What?  What now?  I actually, I've been in touch with, uh, One of the lead security guys for the courthouses, Suffolk and Essex County court offices.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  And he actually told me he might have me come in and talk to them about First Amendment.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Which I don't, like I said, I'm only here to actually have knowledge and stuff and really try to teach people that we should be doing this on top of.  we can do this, you know?  Exactly, here's my card.  Alright, appreciate it.  Here you go.  Thanks.  Alright man, nice meeting you.  Cool, hey, have a good one.  Sweet.  Sorry guys, I'm like trying to get all this shit offset and everything.  That's what we're looking for right there, guys.  Perfect, perfect, perfect.  Everyone have a great, great day.  This has been a good stop here.  Much love, respect, and appreciation. ",
