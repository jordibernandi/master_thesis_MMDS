            "text": "A major victory for feminists in the 1970s was changing the attitude towards women and self-defense, especially when it came to rape.  Armed self-defense literature for women surfaced in the mid-70s, and feminists rallied around women charged with murder for taking out perverts who threatened their own safety or their children's.  Three cases come to mind.  In 1972, Yvonne Wanro, a Colville Indian in Spokane, Washington and mother of two, killed a known child molester who tried to violate her son.  At her trial for murder, the child molester's abuse record was not included in evidence and his victim wasn't allowed to testify.  Wanro was given 25 years.  Feminists, along with organizations like the American Indian Movement, publicized her case and rallied around her.  court ruled for a retrial saying, care must be taken to assure that our self-defense instructions afford women the right to have their conduct judged in light of the individual physical handicaps which are the product of sex discrimination.  In her 1979 retrial, Juanro pleaded guilty to manslaughter and ended up with probation and community service.  In 1974, California, a Cuban Puerto Rican woman named Inez Garcia was raped by a man in an alley while an accomplice kept watch.  The man called her later and threatened to kill her if she didn't leave town, so she took a gun and went looking for them.  She managed to shoot and kill the accomplice, but missed the rapist.  At her trial, the unsympathetic judge said, I do not see what rape has to do with this case, before instructing the jury to ignore Garcia's allegations.  Meanwhile, the judge allowed the prosecution to slut shame Garcia and ask her if she enjoyed the rape.  She was found guilty of second degree murder and afterward, a juror said, you can't kill someone for trying to give you a good time.  Feminists and local organizers who had been publicizing her story since the beginning ramped up their activism while Garcia spent two years in prison.  She was granted a retrial and acquitted thanks to her lawyers making the jury understand rape from the victim's point of view and seeing why her act of self-defense was delayed.  According to Victoria Law, Garcia's acquittal established a legal precedent that extended the interpretation of imminent danger beyond the immediate time period of the assault, laying the foundation for what would later become known as the battered woman's defense, that a woman who killed her abuser is acting in self-defense even if she is not under attack at the time of the killing.  The case of Joan Little in 1974 further changed ideas about women, self-defense, and rape culture.  While imprisoned in North Carolina's Beaufort County Jail, 21 year old Joan Little killed a 62 year old white guard who tried to force her to perform oral sex under threat of an ice pick.  Her case attracted support from lots of feminist groups, black and white, straight and lesbian, and even the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and the Black Panther Party.  Joan's defense expertly supplied jurors with background information on chronic sex abuse and harassment in prisons and discussed the white guard's past violations.  Joan Little was acquitted, setting a precedent for killing one's potential rapist being justified.  While many other women didn't see such happy endings for taking direct action against their abusers, these three cases demonstrate the changes in ideas regarding gender and race in the 70s.  In previous decades, these women wouldn't have received such vast media coverage, nor would there have been groups to organize around them and help them adequately defend themselves. ",
