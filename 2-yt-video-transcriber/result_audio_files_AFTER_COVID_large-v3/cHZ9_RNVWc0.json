            "text": "Hello?  Hey, JT.  How you doing?  I'm so frustrated because of everything that's going on right now.  My family's telling me to come on back to Jehovah.  I don't know what to do.  What do you think I should do, man?  I'm so scared right now.  So, so much anxiety.  I mean, all this crazy stuff happening in the world.  Bro, what is going on, man?  The world seems like it's coming to an end.  It's like revelations is happening.  I'm so confused.  You know, it's troubling.  When you get a chance, let's talk.  You're listening to The Critical Thought, where we challenge our listeners to use critical thinking when examining the teachings of Jehovah's Witnesses.  I mean, we talked to so many people in the last month.  I mean, this is probably one of the busiest months we've had because so many people have been calling us, emailing us, trying to reach us.  We have been talking to people just literally all around the world.  I mean, I'll tell you, and that phone is a wonderful thing.  But it's sad.  They have family members who are calling them up.  You need to come back to Jehovah.  I never left Jehovah.  I left Watchtower Bible and Tract Society Corporation.  I don't move their books no more.  They didn't do a God.  And so it's very, very sad.  And these are the same people who have shunned them for years.  Why would you want to go back to be in a group of people who treat you like dirt?  I mean, that makes no sense.  And so one guy told me, if I got to live with y'all in the new system, I don't want to be there.  So... I mean, it's very, very sad.  And so watching our family members who are still in.  Just shudder in fear.  You're going to die.  You're going to die.  I mean, I remember when we left the organization 20-something years ago, 20-something years ago.  Folks called the house and left a message on our answer machine.  Y'all going to die.  I'm like, oh, Lord, please.  I feel so sorry for you.  And right now, sad to say, some of those same people who called us, they are catching it right now.  And it's real sad.  I mean, good people.  They meant well.  They were just doing what they were told, like all of us do.  But they're catching it right now.  I mean, they're catching it.  I mean, that monkey is on their back right now.  And it's very unfortunate.  So, you know, we're living in a very interesting time, something we've never experienced, but that's the story of humanity.  Everybody who went through any period of time, they went through something they never went through before.  Those folks who went through World War II, and you could just go back on, just get on to the timeline of history, and you can go around back through every type of plague you can think of.  And so, this will pass.  I mean, it's just sad to think that there are witnesses who, I mean, when I was in the organization, Anything like this would flare up.  Your ears pick up, just like a doubling picture.  You know, something's going on, something's going on.  And you would just be hanging on to every thread.  You know, many of you remember, you know, back in the 80s, true peace and security.  If a Jehovah's Witness heard anybody use the word true peace and security, all of a sudden it goes off.  And it's kind of ironic because the Watchtower has given all these different interpretations of how stuff can happen.  See, where's truth?  We got to get true peace and security before Armageddon comes.  So the witness shouldn't even be worried about Armageddon is coming right now.  Because we got to get the true peace and security first.  Everybody's supposed to be happy.  All the nations are having a good time.  And witnesses are like, it's going to end right now?  No, no, no.  You said that we were going to get true peace and security first.  That's what you said, according to your teachings.  And then you got the Gog of Magog.  And the list just, the watchtower just got this whole plethora of things that have to take place.  And then we'll be cleaning the earth of all wickedness.  And after a while, you know, when you're grown up in that stuff, you realize y'all guys just know what y'all are talking about.  Now, Witnesses got a lot of things, I give people credit, I tell people all the time, Witnesses taught me a lot of stuff.  Don't cheat, don't steal, pay your taxes on time.  So yes, they taught me stuff that was good.  But they also taught us stuff that was absolutely asinine.  Stuff that was goofy and had nothing to do with the Bible.  If you look in the backyard of the Watchtower Society, you will see a trash pile of teachings that were presented to every man, woman, and child on this earth.  as a teaching of God the Almighty.  Those churches who are not teaching this, you are not teaching the truth.  That's what they said.  We didn't say it, they did.  And now those same teachings are sitting in the back of the Watchtower Society on the trash pile.  As one guy told me, he said, if the world were to end because of this, it won't be the Jehovah's Witness style, leaving them in charge of everything after everything is done.  And all I could do was laugh because I said, that's a valid point.  But, you know, it's interesting story.  Many people are hunkered down in their homes still.  Lady C and I, we're still here in the house.  We're fortunate enough to work in a type of industry where we can work remotely.  And we're very thankful for that.  But for those of you who are out there, take care of yourselves.  Take care of your families.  Take care of your mental health.  Do not allow yourself to fall back into the fog.  Please, because once again, you will be starting the clock all over trying to get yourself together, get your life together and move on.  We talked to so many people who went back out to 9-11, wasted four and five years in the organization, came back out and then they had to start all over again.  Don't let that be you.  Don't let that be you.  recognize this religion for what it is.  A group of people who are no doubt very, very sincere.  As I tell people, I don't doubt the sincerity of a Jehovah's Witness.  Unfortunately, the information they're working with, not only can you doubt it, you can look at it and see it sitting out in the backyard on the trash pile.  Information that they told me, you, and every human on earth.  We got this from God.  That's why you have to live by it.  That's why you have to accept it as the truth.  Only for years to pass by and say, well, my bad.  I'm sorry.  You can't do that.  Critical thinking is something that as Jehovah's Witnesses, we were discouraged from doing.  Don't think too deep is what Carl Klein, a member of the governing body, used to tell the Bethel family all the time.  Don't do a lot of deep study.  He tells it all the time from the breakfast table.  And the reason why is very simple, because when you start doing something beyond the depths of the thin watchtower, you start seeing stuff and coming across stuff that you realize.  this don't make any sense.  I want each and every one of you to think about this.  The watchtower uses a book that goes back thousands of years.  The Watchtower tells you that this book is reliable.  You can put your confidence in it.  It's called the Bible.  This is what the Watchtower says.  You can put full confidence in God's word.  I want you to think about this and you can put this to the test.  I challenge anyone out there, anyone out there, put this to the test.  Do you realize that the Watchtower has had four presidents who have passed away in death.  And during the period of time that each of these men served as the Watchtower's president, there were publications and books that were written while they were alive.  Do you realize there is practically no book that a Jehovah's Witness could take to someone's home and say this book contains the truth.  Do you know why?  Because they've all been thrown in the trash.  What was proclaimed as the truth during the days of Charles Taz Russell had been pulled off the shelf and thrown into the trash.  Not one book that was written while he was living is being used by Jehovah's Witnesses.  It is all trash now.  J.F.  Rutherford.  When J.F.  Rutherford took over the organization, he turned this organization into a publishing juggernaut.  Rolling out books after book after book because he realized, I can make a lot of money.  I already got a group of people who are going to buy them anyway.  And if they sell them, that's fine too and get their money back.  But I already got my money before I sent them down to the congregation.  Do you realize there's not one book that was written on the J.F.  Rutherford that any Jehovah's Witness can use today?  And take to someone's home and say, this is the truth.  All those books that were released at those conventions in the summertime have been trashed.  Every single one of them.  Nathan North.  You are going to look around and see.  how many books do Jehovah's Witnesses still use today in knocking on people's doors and saying this contains the truth.  The same with Fred Franz.  Practically all the books this man was responsible for all that goofy stuff.  all those revisions in the Revelation book that had to be redone and basically put into the trash pile.  It is amazing when you look at how many books the society has basically put into the trash heap because they have no value.  How do you teach people for 150 years that something is the truth And today you cannot teach them that this book contains the truth.  How does that work?  Especially when you claim you got it from God himself.  And this is what the type of organization that we were a part of.  It is the coolest thing in the world.  The White House publications are like milk.  They have an expiration date.  Truth has no expiration date.  If something is true today, it's true tomorrow.  That's the way it works.  But we were conditioned.  to expect our truths to change.  Rarely will you ever hear a Jehovah's Witness talk about how our teachings are solid as a rock.  Well, we change our teachings.  Well, you change your teachings because they're wrong.  But when you presented them, you presented them as truths of God.  The Watchtower has never said the following information is the best understanding of the Watchtower writers and you can take it or leave it.  They don't do that.  If the one-star writer has put something in that magazine you're going to study on Sunday, and you go up after that meeting and you ask the brother, I don't think about this right, you're going to have problems on your hands.  If a person on the job tells a Jehovah's Witness, no, I disagree with what you have in that pamphlet there, the witness is not going to go along with that.  He knows better.  So this is where we are as we watch this organization once again deal with a very tragic world event, how they play it, how they milk it for all it's worth.  And I'm going to tell you, it is such a relief not to have to live in the type of fear that we lived in.  So when people call and say, you know, should I go back to the Keenum Hall?  We tell them, Take the time, ask the critical thinking questions, and you'll know what you need to do.  This has been JT.  Take care of yourself and your family.  Be safe.
