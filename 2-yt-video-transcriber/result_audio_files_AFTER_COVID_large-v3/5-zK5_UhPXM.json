            "text": "guys.  um i wanted to do a little follow-up.  i just got through during my stream and there were some things that we talked about that we discussed.  i obviously didn't.  i was at a loss for words man uh.  and the last video that i did talking about the last was two and i'm gonna expand upon that as i have been doing a whole week.  i don't care if you're tired of me talking about it.  i really do appreciate all the support for my band's new single.  uh that will be in the description.  you guys the continued support.  we've been climbing up these up and down these charts.  I appreciate all you guys' support.  You guys have been absolutely amazing.  Again, I will put the link in the description.  The song is called The Great Equalizer by my band Backwards.  That's B-A-C-K-W-O-R-D-Z.  So... Last of us two, okay?  There's some layers to what we need to discuss because I think a lot of these weirdos get it twisted, okay?  First of all, stop making excuses for the terrible story, okay?  You don't have to make excuses.  There's clearly a disconnect between the critics, the professional critics, corporate critics, access media critics because there's a disconnect.  There's a lot of people.  that is very polarizing and I think that speaks to the lack of more so integrity that they have, because I've always had this sort of idea that they are to be taken with a grain of salt.  Definitely critics that are tied to more corporate entities, bigger entities, because they want to maintain access that you got to take those with a grain of salt.  Also, that goes for even people that want to get access.  So even more private entities, individuals, you got to take with a grain of salt.  But I certainly would trust the latter more than I would the former when it comes to this disconnect.  And I already see it.  People create invisible enemies.  They have to try to perpetuate this nonsensical idea that the people that may dislike their product are bad people.  So they're being called racist, transphobic, sexist, alt-right, all of these different types of people.  They're saying that those are the ones that have an issue with the story.  That's bull job, and I'm not going to allow you to get away with it.  The story is garbage, and that's on the fault of whoever wrote it, whoever allowed it to come into fruition, whoever thought it was a great idea to put out.  And it's not just, yes, we know.  And again, there's going to be spoilers.  I don't care.  I should spoil it for you.  I don't want you spending your money on this game.  But it's going to sell a lot.  I mean, that's just kind of what it is.  Normies are going to normie.  But for people that have actually played this first game and see the story play out, it's already out.  You don't have to play it.  It is a very linear story driven game.  And I'm not talking about the game play.  I'm not talking about the graphics.  I don't need to play it.  Nobody needs to play it to understand what happens in it.  The story is already out.  You can see hours upon hours of gameplay, walkthroughs and so forth.  It's already gone.  It's already ready to rock.  And because it's a story-driven game, you're not given any option.  You're forced into these situations.  We know what happens.  You can see it.  It's out now.  I know some people personally that did have review copies.  Nonetheless, I'm speaking specific to the storyline.  If you play the first, yes, the game, a big-time talking point as far as what pisses people off is what happened to Jewel.  but it's the context that makes it even worse.  Not just even the fact that you got to play with a big mama pump, the person that kills Joel, the way he dies.  It's not just that.  You also have to take into consideration the fact that the situation that he was put in makes absolutely no sense.  And I'm just using this as one big example.  The fact that he was set up Allows.  Himself, Tommy.  Or what have you.  To basically give up their full names.  As to who they are.  Which obviously triggers Abby.  which I don't understand how she thinks.  her father being killed off, who actually tried to, was ready to kill Ellie in the first game, nonetheless.  I guess they have more high ground there.  Nonetheless, game actually tries to make you feel very sympathetic to Abby and try to make her a likable character.  She's not.  You hate her.  And you should hate her.  And I don't think that's what they were going for.  You should hate her, though.  It makes you hate her when you consider what's happening.  But I don't think that was by design.  But you know how cautious, how untrustworthy, he's not gonna just trust folks like that, initially people that he just met.  But he does that and it ends up getting him killed.  That's what doesn't make sense.  So it's also, and we've talked about this on this channel when it comes to the comic book, where writers write things to tell a story, no matter if it makes sense for the character to be involved in that particular situation.  So Joel's death is jacked up for a multitude of different reasons.  But also it shows the piss poor writing when you consider how he died.  What got him killed is something that is antithetical to his personality from what we learned in the previous game.  It makes no sense.  And we know what happens in the ending.  That also makes no sense.  None.  When you consider Ellie kills all of these people, gets her fingers bit off, doesn't kill Abby, makes no sense.  But it didn't have to.  What was the idea, the motive here?  I don't know.  But we don't have to make excuse for that piece of garbage.  I know a lot of people are going to support it out of spite because again, they created the invisible enemy.  They got to pretend that people that dislike this are Those very, very bad people.  And they just don't understand.  Right.  And they just don't like to see LGBT.  Shut up.  The hell are you talking about, man?  The story is trash.  And it is layers of trash.  Layers of trash.  You waited, what, seven years for this garbage story?  And it's amazing, because as I said in the last video, you think that the context would either make it better or at least remain sort of neutral, because we got a gist of what was gonna happen.  But it's worse than that.  The added context is worse.  The added context is worse.  It's worse, man.  The added context is worse.  It makes the game, I couldn't have ever even envisioned that, that it was going to be worse, but it was worse.  And we don't have to make excuses for us, for them.  At some point, people need to acknowledge that when it comes to what's coming out now, a lot of entertainment, there's a lot of garbage being put out.  Now, they don't ever want to face that garbage because we have this sort of cultural war going on as well.  So God forbid someone actually dislike it.  And believe it or not, there are people on different sides of the political spectrum that are like, this is garbage.  This isn't an exclusive opposite to the left end.  Like, this is what it is.  It was trash.  It didn't make sense.  I'm speaking specifically to the storyline, and I have to continue to reiterate that.  And a lot of people are just going to continue to make excuses for it, and they're going to say that you don't like it because something's wrong with you as far as your morality.  You're a bad person.  Invisible enemy that they will continue to create because God forbid that these clowns put out a bad product or crappy product in one particular regard.  And that is the storyline.  God forbid that they actually have to own up to that, that they have to own up to that.  But they don't want to do that.  Why?  Leave that up for your personal interpretation.  Why they wanted, why they don't, why the audience continues that we're at this point.  So the audience continues to get blamed in the event that there is this.  A lot of people that may dislike disagree aren't really fond of what's being put out.  God forbid that that is the case.  Which it can be.  You're not perfect.  But you get a lot of folks that hate it out of spite because that's just how it is.  It's a culture thing.  There was guys that are going to support this no matter what.  And that was just what it was going to be.  They were going to support it no matter what.  And definitely when they saw who was disliking it, they were for sure going to support it top to bottom.  It didn't matter what they put out.  They were going to justify it, say you didn't understand.  It wasn't for you, yada, yada.  That's what happens.  But we don't have to make excuses.  It's a garbage storyline.  And everybody's in their right to dislike it.  And I would encourage you not to buy this.  Like I said, I don't even.  Redbox is still doing games.  Gamefly still.  They don't get it.  Don't even rent it.  Just don't play it.  Only thing I said that, you know, because maybe the gameplay is OK.  OK.  All I can say is I know the multiplayer, which was what would have got me to get it.  Because I played a clocked in a lot of hours.  last of us the first last of us is the game I probably played the most of all games that I've ever owned for the places three or places before.  I clocked so many hours and you can't tell me nothing about this game and I clocked so many hours Not just playing like a normie but playing through the story story mode.  I clocked in all those hours playing 4v4 with my bros and it was very fun very competitive.  Only thing I can say is if they maybe release a side game or more so if they add it as a DLC or something like that, or just maybe it's still, maybe it's actually on the game already.  I don't know.  That's the only thing that I can see happening is they add that multiplayer, but more importantly, they sell it separately.  So it's not a full game.  It's like, you want to play last of us to multiplayer factions.  Okay.  15 bucks.  And it's yours.  Then maybe, okay, you consider it.  But as far as that storyline, don't touch it.  Don't touch the game.  It's going to sell a lot.  I mean, there's not too many normies.  Twitch, everybody wants to play through it.  They want to see their audience react.  It's the perfect kind of game to do that.  And there's a lot of people who don't even understand the context.  Half the time, I think a lot of the guys that review it do it.  I was reading some corporate review earlier, and one of these dudes was like, it was like a lovely send-off of some very established and rooted characters or something like that.  I was like, what the hell you see a lovely send-off?  What lovely send-off is this?  It lets me know that it's like a copy and paste.  It's like they had to say that.  What you talking about?  Something along those lines.  It might have not been verbatim.  That's a side note.  Storyline sucks.  And I don't have to apologize.  Nobody has to apologize.  I don't care how you mean.  You can call us bots.  Call us all you want to.  That storyline is a piece of absolute flaming hot Cheeto trash. ",
