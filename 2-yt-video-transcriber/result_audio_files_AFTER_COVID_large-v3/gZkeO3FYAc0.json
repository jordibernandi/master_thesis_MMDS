She would have responded if she didn't have a mask.  Huh?  Well, she didn't smile at me, but how would I know if she did?  Of course not.  Do you understand what veiling a population does to human intercourse?  Do you understand that?  It's dehumanizing masks.  Why opposed to the Muslim veil?  It's dehumanizing of women.  But anyway, liberals don't care about the veil.  The former head of the Reform rabbinate gave a speech years ago to the Muslim Society of North America, Islamic Society of North America.  And he said, I respect the veil.  Because he's a good liberal, good lefty.  He respects the veil?  Well, I don't.  Why is making people invisible respectable?
