            "text": "Thank you.  Hey guys, some quick news for you.  I'll try not to drag this out too long.  So I was a member of the heightism2 and back to school's height servers on Discord.  And I don't know how true this is.  I've heard it's rumor.  I don't know.  Apparently, one of these servers, probably the heightism2 server, they let.  they let some women in or something and an argument ensued.  i'm not sure if this is even true.  i don't know what happened.  i didn't really look in there too much.  well an argument ensued and she ended up.  or the women or somehow they ended up getting the server banned on discord and And on Discord, when a server gets banned, all of the members of that server, all of their accounts get banned along with it for some great wise reason.  They just ban everyone.  so anyway my face and lms discord account got banned along with everyone else's.  so i have had to set up a new discord account.  the old one won't work anymore.  don't try to message me on that account.  don't try to talk to me.  if i if you're like why isn't he?  why isn't he responding?  it's because i can't.  i'm locked out of that account.  it's done.  it's over.  it's a wrap.  So I have a new account.  It is face and LMS hash 3804.  So face and LMS hash 3804.  That's my new account from now on until this one gets banned.  You know, I've been through so many.  I'm going to try and get Skype working this time.  Like the last two streams, Skype wasn't working because some issues, but I'll try to get Skype working this time around.  I'm back on Twitter.  I think I insulted a woman on Twitter, and so they banned my account.  And they said, to get back on Twitter, you have to... You have to put in your phone number.  And I thought, no way am I doing that because no way am I giving Twitter my phone number.  Are you serious?  Because I live in a police state.  And if Twitter has my phone number and I offend a woman again, then, you know, the police will come around and, you know, I'll be arrested for crimes against humanity again.  So not doing that.  So I just set up a new account.  So my new account on Twitter is at faceandlms2, the number two.  And also if you don't want me to rope and you want me to continue making videos, you can donate via paypal.me.  slash faceandlms2.  That's the number two.  patreon.com slash faceandlms, subscribestar.com slash faceandlms.  Also, Poacher and Pygmy, I can't get in contact with you.  Can you send me a message or get in contact with me, you know, in the sit-down or on Skype or however you can.  Urgently need to speak to you guys.  What else do I want to say?  people waiting for What Attracts Women 6.  I'm going to start working or finish work, not finish, I'm going to continue working on that today.  I've been so busy and this predicament didn't help, but I'm going to dedicate some time to working on What Attracts Women 6 today.  I'm still at the scripting stage, so it's going to be a while, but my goal is to have it ready for June.  Now, you know how I am with lateness, so don't hold me to that, but My aim is to use this lockdown time at home to use it to full effect.  So you guys waiting for What Attracts Women 6, all I can ask is that you continue to be patient.  And when you do see it, you will be a patient in a hospital because it's going to be brutal.  So like I said, on Discord, Face and LMS, hash 3804.  Face and LMS, hash 3804.  So thanks for watching, and I'll talk to you on Saturday night.  Okay, a quick update.  I've just had it confirmed that a woman in the Hytism2 Discord server, they allowed a woman in, and she, I think an argument ensued, and she posted birthday suit pictures of Vanessa Hudgens or someone, some celebrity, and then reported the server for inappropriateness of some kind maybe age-related inappropriateness or i don't know some harassment against uh women or i don't know whatever and so um it the server got banned.  so i think that well that's as much as i know.
