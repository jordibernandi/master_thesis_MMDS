This is a symptom of much deeper issues and challenges that have been stewing for a long time and a lot, especially as of late over this last year.  Where this conflict culture that we have seen growing in our society, whether it's online and now it's being embodied or actioned offline, it results in something like this.  And so you've got to look at... What's driving this?  What's fueling it?  You can look at politicians, political leaders who are more interested in fueling and fueling divisiveness, riling people up for their own personal or political benefit.  You see the media doing the same thing for ratings.  You see big tech, these big tech monopolies and Facebook using their algorithms and social media to continue to push and push and put fuel on the flames of this divisiveness.  Well, you see what is happening here today at the United States Capitol before our very eyes is the manifestation of that.  That is the symptom of these deeper problems.  And from a leadership perspective, I think this is where you've got to look to the kind of leadership we need but don't have in this country right now, which is leadership that puts the well-being of the people and country before themselves, before political power, before their selfish ambition.

And I think that it's become such a segmented thing.  where you have, whether it's political leadership, those in the media or those in new media, whatever it is, you have these quote-unquote influencers that are only speaking to their segment of people who agree with them or believe the same things that they believe.  And there's no exposure, real civil discourse or dialogue to people who might have different views, different opinions, different beliefs, different political positions.  And I think it's not only not a good thing for our country, but it, I think, also contributes, especially when you're using this divisive rhetoric and language that can help fuel those who then get riled up and say, oh, actually, you know what?  I'm gonna go take action on this because those people, they are my enemy.  That's the dangerous thing. ",

And that's a very dangerous thing because when I say leading with aloha, I don't mean just, okay, we're just going to sit back and not do anything.  Leading with aloha means standing up and fighting for what is right, but doing so within the construct of the institutions that we have in this country.  For example, if you are concerned about the legitimacy and the integrity of our elections, Take action to do something.  I introduced a bill called the Securing America's Election Act that if our country's leaders had passed would have prevented a lot of the angst that people are feeling and seeing right now with this election saying that you have to have a paper that You have to have an auditable paper backup for any electronic system so that there's no doubt or question in mind if there has been a hack attempt or some attempt to manipulate our votes as voters.  If all of these people in Congress, Democrat and Republican, had taken that issue seriously and passed that legislation, those who are now saying, hey, we have to stand up for the integrity, why didn't you do something about it before?  Mm-hmm.  We do need to stand up and fight for the well-being of this country, stand up for our Constitution, uphold it.  But we need to do it in a way that is constructive and within the institutions that have been set up in this society that is America. ",

If Tulsi Gabbard was the future of the Democratic Party, I could honestly consider myself a Democrat.  I can't do that anymore.

It was, frankly, a practical decision where I could not both run for reelection to Congress and continue running for president at the same time.  And I made the decision to run for president.  It was a very serious decision that was well thought through.  And I made the decision to continue that campaign for the presidency because of the grave issues that I was raising in that campaign and the kind of change in leadership that I really believe our country needs.  So I'm going to continue to fight.  I may not be in Congress anymore as of a few days ago, but I'm going to continue to advocate for freedom.  I'm going to continue to advocate for common sense solutions in our society and in our government and to continue to bring the truth to the conversations that we as a country should be having. ",
