            "text": "Welcome back to another WNBA video.  I just want to congratulate you for watching something that gets more views than actual WNBA games.  I'm going to be honest though.  I'm starting to get more interested in the WNBA as time goes by.  I find it really interesting that there's more people on Twitter complaining about the viewership than people actually watching themselves.  I find it interesting that most of the players in the league have more tweets complaining about their pay than they do career dunks.  All this has really started to draw me in.  I'm starting to realize that the WNBA product is just legit.  It is great.  How do I know this?  Because the players have told me about it.  I haven't heard much from fans or anywhere else, but the players, they'll tell you.  Another recent controversy stars Erica Wheeler, who is a WNBA player for the Indiana Fever.  I've never heard of her before, but she was apparently an All-Star MVP.  That's a pretty big deal.  Yet, her latest claim to fame is not for what she does on the court, but what she does on her Twitter account.  Back in October, she had a tweet comparing LeBron James and Sue Bird.  I'ma sit this right here.  Let's take a look at what she put up.  First off, I had to crop this for her.  She couldn't even do it herself.  Or whoever she told to make this for.  Sue Bird versus LeBron James.  17 seasons in the NBA.  They both have four championships.  Ooh, 2020 salary.  $215,000 compared to $37 million.  Oh my goodness.  How does something like this happen?  It's unbelievable.  Oh no, no.  The bonuses for winning a championship.  No, no.  $11,000 versus LeBron.  three hundred and seventy thousand no that is absurd.  oh my god erica wheeler we must stand her.  she is making an absolutely amazing point.  i found my new favorite w n b a player.  guys my interest is just through the roof.  honestly if i had to sit here and explain to you why lebron james is not in the same level Sue Bird you are utterly confused.  you have no idea what's going on.  you don't understand business you don't understand basic economics or maybe you do.  you just don't care because it's pretty clear that the WNBA is only kept alive by the NBA.  the NBA makes all the money WNBA does not.  they get paid based on the revenue that comes in.  everybody knows this and the skill level of the leagues are insanely different.  So four championships in one league is a lot different than four championships in another league.  I guarantee you, you put LeBron in the WNBA, he would not have four championships.  I swear to God that man could play till 60 and he would still win a championship every single year.  LeBron is literally known worldwide for what he does on the court and Sue Bird is known for what she talks about off the court.  People don't watch the WNBA.  And it's not men's fault, it's women's.  Because women choose not to watch it as well.  They're just like the men.  They don't like it either.  One of the best things about tweets like this is the comment section that follows.  Tuatime takes his time to tweet about how the WNBA makes less revenue.  And little Jason here wants to know why.  Why do people not watch the WNBA?  Because it's a cultural bias.  He doesn't think any women's sport is treated equally to men's.  Did he ever stop to think that?  maybe there's an actual reason for that?  Maybe they're treated unequally because they are not equal.  Maybe it's not really a cultural gender bias.  Maybe it's more of a cultural gender understanding.  People just understand that there are basic differences between men and women and it really shows in sports.  These comments did not pass the vibe check.  The misogyny is real.  All these men saying the NBA makes more money not understanding that it's due to systematic sexism and that it could be changed by providing the WNBA with prime airtime, promotion of women's sports, and increased advertising.  That has been done.  The NBA over the past few years has been doing a lot to promote the WNBA and the reason that channels do not show them on prime time is because nobody is going to watch them.  People would rather watch other shit and that other shit being the NBA.  There's a ton of advertising.  Oh my god, you can see any NBA game and you will get a ton of ads for a WNBA game that is playing that night or the next night or whatever.  It's everywhere.  NBA fans are getting plenty of ads for the WNBA.  They're just choosing not to watch it.  And as for people that aren't basketball fans, well, they're not basketball fans.  They're not going to tune into the WNBA either.  The only reason more people watch the NBA than the WNBA is because one is for the men and the other is for women.  Still an issue of sexism.  So why aren't women watching?  Seems like internalized misogyny.  That's a good question.  And that's brought up all the time as well.  Say men don't want to watch women play basketball.  Not a big deal, right?  They still have the women that can watch, but they don't want to watch either.  Women don't even want to watch the NBA.  They want no part of it.  They don't like it.  And if they think the NBA is just better than the WNBA, it's because it is.  They like watching that better.  It's more entertaining.  If women actually supported the WNBA the way men support NBA, WNBA players would get paid.  The money would come through.  But they don't.  The support is not there.  And it probably never will be until something changes with the game.  The only way that this league is ever going to grow is if they get women to start watching.  But a lot of women don't like basketball.  I am a basketball fan.  I prefer the NBA because that's just what I prefer.  I think they're the best.  I prefer watching college because this is all the guys leading up to the NBA.  I even like watching a little bit of high school here and there.  It's just good basketball.  It's a different sport compared to the women.  I am a basketball fan, and I'm one of the people that they need to convince to watch the WNBA.  I'm their viewership.  I'm part of their target.  But there's nothing about the WNBA that is interesting or draws my attention.  That's just how it is.  Their game is not good.  It's not entertaining.  And I bet my life that most of the people on Twitter complaining that, oh, why don't more people watch, probably don't even watch themselves.  They're probably not even like me.  They probably don't watch basketball at all.  They just, oh, they follow along.  Oh, I keep up.  And they don't actually know anything.  They don't actually care.  But they speak out on it.  Oh, yeah, they'll let you know.  They'll tell you their opinion.  They complain about the viewership, yet they do nothing to contribute to it.  Twitter is an absolute joke.  If you haven't figured that out already, you're a little behind.  Or you're probably in the WNBA.  That's going to be it for this video.  Hit the like button, comment, and subscribe.  I'm out.  What?
