            "text": "We are at the point now that what's going on here is all narrative.  It's all political narrative and it's all fake.  And I'm going to prove it to you here in a moment.  as I walk you through this data.  You are seeing a second wave of panic porn that is far worse than the first.  And the reason being is we had data before.  Or we have data now that we didn't have before.  Before, you know, we had what China told us.  Was it true?  Was it not?  We could make some assumptions based on the laws of virology, immunology, biology.  But if you wanted to panic before, you know, we've not seen a coronavirus evolve from animal to animal and animal to human the way this one had.  That's why we called it a novel coronavirus.  If you wanted to panic before, there were some legit reasons.  I still didn't favor the panic then.  But there was at least a rationale for it.  You didn't have to hate America.  There were reasons to do this other than, you know, locking the country down so you can win the next election.  There were other reasons to go to this place back in March that we eventually went.  Except now, we have all kinds of data that proves you're being lied to.  One of the subtle ways you're being lied to right now, Spain shows antibodies may not mean you're immune.  Well, then why are we trying to develop a vaccine?  What is a vaccine then?  If antibodies don't work, then what are we doing anything for then?  By the way, You were betting pro basketball in Spain last month, right?  Yeah, yeah.  They all dropped dead and I can't anymore.  Yeah, so the Spaniards clearly were very, very concerned about the lack of immunity from antibodies.  So concerned, they just finished their pro basketball season over there.  So there's that.  See, nowhere else in the world, folks, and I mean it, nowhere else in the free world are you being lied to about this virus like you are here at home.  And I'm gonna show you, beginning with this chart.  This is the one chart to rule them all right here.  I want you to get a very, very good look at that chart.  Aaron, leave that up there for just a second.  Soak this chart in.  This is the Bubba Gump shrimp of charts.  You can fry it, you can saute it, you can boil it, you can broil it, all right?  It is the ultimate chart.  It takes us back to the very beginning of the immediate narrative of this virus, late February, through yesterday, July 6th.  And on the blue line, you're going to see cases.  On the orange line, you're going to see deaths.  One of these things is not like the other.  This is the difference.  This chart right here.  is the difference between a pandemic and a scandemic.  The pandemic was the deaths, right?  I mean, the reason you shut your country, you don't shut your country down because of the bad cold strain going around.  By the way, do you know what kind of virus most colds are?  Coronaviruses.  But you don't shut a country down because of a bad strain of the cold.  Why?  Because it might be really bad, but colds don't typically do what with people?  Kill them.  Colds don't typically kill people, no matter how bad the cold season is.  So you shut things down because this may kill all kinds of people.  And it has.  But if you look at this chart again, you're going to notice that it hasn't been killing that many people for the last couple of months.  In fact, what you'll note... is a precipitous decline in the deaths.  Well, Steve, there's a lag time.  Let's discuss that lag time, shall we?  Symptoms usually show up five to seven days after infection for those who will eventually have them.  Deaths usually occur within three weeks of infection for those who will perish.  As you can see when you look at this chart, the arc for new cases begins to rise around June the 10th.  See the arrow we put there for you?  That's where the arc for new cases begins.  That will be four weeks ago tomorrow.  Four weeks ago.  So we should already be seeing a subsequent rise in deaths within that three-week lag if we were going to.  We should be seeing it right now.  We should be in the middle of it right now.  Instead, deaths have continued to fall.  And in fact, they have plummeted 92% since their peak in April.  That should be cause for celebration.  Elation.  Elation.  Unfortunately for some of our countrymen, particularly those that work in the media, it is dismay that they're not indeed living through an apocalypse after all.  Have you heard this reported to you anywhere else?  A 92% drop in deaths since we peaked in deaths in April, almost three months ago.  And if the answer is no, well then ask yourself why?  Now, what about the dichotomy here?  How could we be seeing a rise in new cases?  A dramatic one, in fact.  At the same time, we're seeing a dramatic drop in deaths, and we're in the middle of the lag time now where deaths should be going back up.  The death chart should be going upwards, guys, right now.  We're four weeks in to when the cases began to surge, and yet they continue to go down.  How do we explain this?  I think there's several possible explanations for this dichotomy.  Number one, look at our testing.  We are testing more than ever.  Over 600,000 people per day.  Many companies are demanding at least one, if not two, negative tests before they're letting employees return to work.  People are returning to hospitals and other facilities for medical care that was put off for the last three months.  And then when you're there, you're getting tested, particularly in a hospital.  So there's a distinction between being there with the COVID or being there because of it.  Also, you have states like Arizona counts a positive antibody test as a positive case.  Texas was doing this in the month of May, too.  So you have states that are, every time you test positive, if you keep going back over and over and over again to find out, am I through, am I done?  Some states are recording every one of those as a positive.  It varies state to state.  Number two, look at who we're testing.  We are testing more younger and less at-risk populations than ever before.  The median age of death in every Western country for coronavirus has been about 80.  That's including the United States.  43% of all US deaths were in nursing homes, where only 0.6% of our population lives.  So now that we are testing populations that are less at risk for the virus, you get more infections, more asymptomatic positives, and fewer deaths because the people we're testing now that we're finding out are infected are healthier.  This actually helps us to get to herd immunity.  Putting the younger and healthier people back in their homes is actually a detriment to our public health.  See Sweden.  It's also why all the other Western countries reopened.  Because they recognized there's two ways to get to herd immunity.  There's only three ways to beat a virus.  One, it just goes away like the first SARS did.  It just went away.  At the end of August, it was gone.  The second is herd immunity the old-fashioned way.  The third is herd immunity the vaccination, the new school way.  But that's what vaccines are intended to do, to get us to herd immunity faster than we could on our own, to save lives.  We don't have a vaccine.  So we either need to, A, hope that this just disappears in the dog days of summer like SARS-1 did, or B, we need to get to herd immunity the old-fashioned way, which is.  we need the healthier people out there.  risking exposure because there's more than a 99.5% survival rate if they get exposed.  And then the more of them that get exposed that are healthy help to get the herd healthier and get the herd to herd immunity.  Closing these bars and putting all these young people back at home is bad public health policy.  It's not science.  It's reactionary flat-earthism.  The third factor to consider here.  Cross-border traffic is the leading cause of the surge in new cases.  If you look at California, Arizona, and Texas, county by county, you will see the border counties are way overrepresented in their data.  Way overrepresented.  Let me give you an example.  Hidalgo County in Texas.  It has seen a 641% surge in new cases.  641%.  It accounts for over 20% of all the deaths in Texas.  And yet, it's only 2.9% of the state's population.  Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has noted migrant workers are a leading cause of new cases in his state.  Why does that matter?  Because Mexico's healthcare system sucks.  The only thing Mexico is better at than us, soccer and drug cartels.  In their testing module right now, Mexico is reporting 50% positives.  So we're not even talking illegals here, just the typical migrant worker traffic, people that have dual citizenship, green cards that work across the border, the cross-border traffic.  If you look at the county by county numbers in those states, Look at the counties on the border, then look at the rest of the state.  It's not even close.  There's a massive chasm of difference here.  That cannot be a coincidence, and it's not.  And now let's look at the bigger picture here.  There has never been a vaccine for a coronavirus.  There's never been one.  which means the idea we're just going to hunker down here December, January, next spring.  So the novel coronavirus.  we're going to just magically conjure up a vaccine for when all the ones we've been studying for decades, we've been studying coronaviruses for nearly 70 years.  We haven't come up with one vaccine for the ones we've studied for 70 years.  And you think we're just going to magically conjure one up for the novel virus that just got sprung on us in February and January?  Look at the first SARS.  They spent 12 years trying to come up with a safe vaccine for the first SARS virus.  They could never do it.  They eventually just gave up.  Now, the good news is the epidemiological arc here that we showed you in that first chart, that arc is actually excellent news.  That's excellent news.  I mean, that ought to be like v-e day.  you know vc day victory over coronavirus day that arc especially if it continues for another couple of weeks if we get full bore into the new case surge and deaths continue to go down.  that is excellent news because it means the virus is likely weakening the further that it gets into the population and therefore it is less lethal than ever before.  That we can actually manage it now as every other industrialized free nation on Earth is currently doing.  Every other industrialized free nation on Earth is currently managing this virus.  We're the only country that's not.  Why?  What incentive do we have, the world's lone superpower, what incentive do we have to wreck our lives That they're not doing in the European Union, for example.  What would incentivize us to do this?  I can only come up with one thing.  Sometimes Occam's razor is a female dog.  We're just doing this to ourselves because of the election.  We are killing ourselves with panic porn because of this election.  This now brings us to this White House and President Trump.  He possesses the largest bully pulpit on earth.  We just saw how he reset the debate over rioting and patriotism on the 4th of July with his phenomenal speech at Mount Rushmore.  Well, now it is time for him to turn that bully pulpit and target it at this panic porn.  The worst fake news his administration has faced yet.  He should be asking, where are all the dead Home Depot workers?  Where are all the dead Costco workers?  Where are all the dead truck drivers?  Where are all the dead food deliverers?  You know, the quote-unquote essential workers who still had jobs the last few months while 40 million of us were sent home?  Hell, where's all the dead Blaze TV workers?  We were all still working.  He needs to be asking these questions.  He needs to be using his bully pulpit to crush this panic porn.  In my home state of Iowa, where's all the dead high school athletes who've been playing spring sports for more than a month?  Where's all the dead high school athletes?  Where's all their dead parents?  Where's all the dead officials, managers, umpires?  Where are they?  Where's all the body bags?  If he doesn't start pounding on this with a singular focus... The left media, and he has to do this soon.  It's July 7th.  Kids are supposed to be back in school in America in about six weeks.  The clock is ticking.  If he doesn't do this soon, the left media is going to succeed in keeping the country shut down just long enough for Joe Biden's dementia to win the presidency.  This is the all-in moment right now.  The White House has to defeat this right now.  We can hand you all the data we want.  Me, Daniel Horowitz, Jordan Schachtel, Alex Berenson, name all the names.  Team Sanity.  All of our combined platforms can't hold the jockstrap of the power of the bully pulpit of the White House.  We need a champion.  We will not be able to successfully push back on this on our own.  Somebody with an order of magnitude platform must come forward with this data and squash this panic porn once and for all.  And nobody has a bigger bully pulpit and more of a motivation and incentive, frankly, to use it than President Trump. ",
