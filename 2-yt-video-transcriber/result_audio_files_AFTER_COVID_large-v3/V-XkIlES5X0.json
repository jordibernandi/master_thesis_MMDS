            "text": "Good rising, brethren.  This is Big Judah, coming to you guys from California.  Before I begin, give all praise to the Most High, Yahweh.  Acknowledgement to the Earthly Mother, who is wisdom, who is the Holy Spirit.  Acknowledgement to Yahweh, pray that the Most High blesses this lesson this evening, gives more knowledge and understanding of the events of the past, in order to understand the events that are currently happening on the Earth, so we get a much better understanding of things that are assumed to come on the earth.  This situation is really backfiring and exploding in the other nations' face.  They're opening up wounds that they don't wanna open.  They're opening up doors they don't wanna talk about.  And they are trying their best to not let the information about the Hebrew Israelites go out into the mainstream.  So, you know, I saw this clip here from brother here, Judah Powers, you know, page on Instagram.  And I wanted to actually have you guys listen to it and talk a little bit about it.  You're going to see that Max Kellerman knows exactly what's going on.  Because when he started actually talking about New York and the streets and And what Deshaun was trying to say.  So what you're getting with these people is they're trying to make it seem like he is ignorant.  And anybody that believes that the true people of the Most High are ignorant.  They have bad information.  They haven't been taught the truth.  You see what I'm saying?  It's funny how you guys, this is exactly what's been happening the whole time.  Either you listen to what they say, you listen to the things that, how they've expressed it, how they've told it.  And if you don't accept what they say, you're ignorant.  You're an idiot.  You're a buffoon.  And that's what's been going on the entire time.  We need to make sure that, you know, they want us to make sure that we accept everything that they say as gospel.  That goes back to the churches.  Like, you can't question them.  Can't question how their breakdowns.  They got a breakdown, that's the only way you can see it.  You can't have an alternate point of view.  If you have an alternate point of view, you're an idiot.  You're not educated.  I saw that last night again on, was it Don Lemon Show?  He brought in a couple of Jakes and the woman that was there, I forgot her name, but she was like, well, you know, what Deshaun said was, you know, you just told me he was just not well-informed.  You know, he's ignorant.  And so it's like, so if you question anything, you're an idiot.  And it has tried out a few black people out there and then you're not allowed to think any different.  So that's okay though.  It's the most high right now is planting seeds.  Some people are seeing this information and they're like, hold on, let me see what he said.  And they're gonna go and do a little bit of research.  All you gotta do is look at what was said and then look at what's happened.  Listen to what was posted and then look at what has happened.  Does it fit what he said or what he posted?  Does it fit what Deshaun Jackson posted?  Last time I checked, you guys are still calling me black.  You're still calling me African-American.  Nowhere in the Bible are you going to find African-American.  You're not going to find us being shown as just black people or you guys being shown as white people.  Those are all designations and bywords that the Gentiles have made.  If you guys still taught about Christopher Columbus came here and discovered America, who are the idiots?  If you guys are still talking about how?  Anything pre-Columbian over here, we don't accept, but there's all this great archaeological information here.  Who's the idiot?  There's all this information that shows that the natives here or the Hebrews here were way more advanced.  But who's the idiot?  Who's ignorant?  So you guys don't have, you don't have the, Mosiah hasn't given you that opportunity or that time now to just to be able to say, well, this is because I said it.  And if I said it, then that means if you don't agree with me, you're ignorant.  That's what you guys have been able to do the last 500 years.  But like I said, the most high pretty much showed after that 4th of July blood moon, the things are going to be ramping up.  And now you're seeing how this is ramping up right here.  Now, let's just take a look.  We're just going to listen to what Max is saying.  I don't know what Stephen A. ended up saying later on.  It doesn't really matter to me.  but I'm going to let you guys listen to what Max said here. ",

So you've been able to go to your churches and talk about white Jesus, good times Jesus this whole time, not have to actually prove anything.  Now the Most High is making you have to prove what you're saying.  you know, getting all upset, all this false emotion and everything else.  Once all that plays out, now you need to prove what you're saying.  You just can't say, oh, I'm from New York.  See, when they're saying I'm from New York and you're from New York, they know they're talking about the Hebrew Israelites that are on the camp brethren that are out there.  They've been teaching for years.  And so they know, you see, and that's how slick they are with it.  They want to talk about the Hebrew Israelites, but they don't want to bring them up.  So that's exactly what he's talking about.  That's the people he's talking about have false information.  Now, see, they can't prove them wrong.  That's exactly why they won't bring them up.  They won't mention them.  They'll talk about their information.  But they won't go out there and say, you know, yeah, we know you're both from New York.  We see the Hebrews that's on the corner teaching.  And this is not.  they don't want to bring that up because they don't want people to go in and search that out because they're going to realize that they've been lied to.  about absolutely everything.

He's trying to miseducate them.  The white citizens of America, meaning the non-Jews, would be terrified to know all this time that they've been mistreating and discriminating and lynching the real children of Israel, meaning black people.

            "text": "I'm sure there's more on that clip, but we'll just talk about that right there.  Listen, when he's talking about the white Jews and everybody blaming them, the Most High was the one that covers the eyes of the people.  It's not a particular group of people here.  Just like all of a sudden, after the George Floyd situation, all of a sudden everybody just figured out that us Hebrews here have been getting screwed over.  that they just found out that there's institutional racism?  They just all of a sudden found that out?  No.  I said, there's not a group of people in the world that's that good at keeping people blinded.  The Most High kept the world blinded.  Talks about that in Enoch, how the whole world was going to be blinded.  Talks about in the Book of Mormon, how the whole world's going to be blinded.  And at the end, he was going to open the eyes of the Gentiles.  This is part of the opening eyes of the Gentiles.  the most highest planting these seeds.  It also talks about that in Romans, about how at the end, you know, the most highest people are going to have their eyes blind until the times of the Gentiles are complete.  I mean, it all fits scripture.  You see, now what we're watching is, we're watching the culmination of the most highest plan.  He said he was going to open up the people's eyes, you know, to who we were.  And that's what's been going on for the last month, month and a half.  But they want to give us the bywords as being black people or African-Americans.  Even Max mentioned that.  Blacks and African-Americans, they will let you claim that.  I'm not claiming black or African-American.  Just like you guys can't claim white.  You're not white and I'm not black.  And these other people aren't brown and they're not yellow.  This is the most.  I'm going to say, okay, all my white people come over here.  All my black people go over there.  He's not going to be looking at us like that.  He's going to be going off of your designation by your fathers.  But just for them having this conversation and talking about New York, that's just code word for the Hebrews, for the Israelites that have been teaching for a very long time.  And they don't want to have that discussion.  So that's exactly why he did not bring up the Hebrew Israelites, but he did bring up how they live in New York.  Because that's not a conversation that they want to have, but the Most High is making them have it.  That's all the most high.  He's the one, like I said, after we get past the whole Black Lives Matter, African-American issue, the most high is going to expose to the world who we really are.  And that's when everything is going to pop off even more.  Because it talks about how, even on that statement that Deshaun shared, it talks about how when the world does figure out who we are, that will be the beginning of World War III.  So you just think right now, look how crazy people went right now when they were talking about us being, you know, just as black people or African-Americans and all the things that they've done to us and how screwed up it was and everything else.  You just think about how crazy we're going to go as soon as they're going to be, as soon as they find out that we are the most highest chosen people.  And then they start to make the connection of what happened with Egypt and how the most high destroyed Egypt for what they did to us.  And I just finished watching a great video by UB News on America is Egypt, the fourth part.  That was a great video.  I'm going to actually do some more.  I'll do a couple of videos and kind of combine some of that information because it just makes a lot more sense.  But yeah, check out UB TV.  I said that America is Egypt, the fourth part.  This is a great video.  But that's the whole thing.  They've made history.  I mean, what have they taught us?  is the truth.  They haven't taught us anything.  that's the truth.  Everything they've taught us is a lie.  They've been having us celebrate presidents that had slaves, beat, raped, robbed, murdered.  They had a president actually having holidays for Columbus who was responsible for the death of millions of our people.  having given us a new year in the dead of winter.  So now they're in no position to sit there and say that what we're saying is ignorance or what we're saying is bad information.  The Mosiah is showing you people's spirits.  Like I said, you can easily see these people who look like us.  I said, if they're told to go out there and say this, that's exactly what they're going to say.  They're going to come out here and just tell everybody that Deshaun Jackson's ignorant.  That's what they're going to say.  And then people won't go any further.  Well, people who are ignorant themselves, real ignorant people, won't go and look at anything.  Because they don't want to unpeel that scab.  They don't pull that scab back.  Because it's going to hurt when they realize that everything they've been told is a lie.  Everything in the religions are lies.  But somehow they seem to think that they are in some kind of position of authority to tell us what's right and what's wrong.  When they start proving Stuff to us.  See, they think they can just say things and not have to prove anything.  So those days are over with.  So I pray that, you know, the Most High opens up the eyes of the ones he's calling right now.  Because that's what's, it's like a last call.  We had the revealing of who we are as Blacks and African Americans.  The second revealing is going to be, the revealing is going to be of us being the Most High's chosen people.  That's what's going on right now.  I also wanted to make sure I told you guys that the website, bigduda.com, the Brethren actually put up a great library over there.  So if you're new or if you're not new and there's some books over there, you guys can get the PDF versions over there on bigduda.com.  Another way for you guys to be reading and studying and getting caught up if you haven't read a lot of these books.  And just go see.  I think they're going to actually be adding more information.  You know, you got, so we also got the notebooks back up as well.  They got the notebooks back up as well.  So thank you everyone who's been helping and contributing to this work.  I said, we appreciate it.  So we're trying to get this word out, you know, through the most high to absolutely everyone as we're coming here, you know, we're in these end days right now.  So thank you so much for everything that the nation has been doing and to support us, you know, your prayers as well, everything, you know, the books, monetary gifts, everything you guys have been giving.  We appreciate absolutely everything.  And we're all in this together.  You know, I said, it's just a beautiful thing to watch how this is all grown and this information is growing out.  And now we can easily see what's going on.  We can see how the multi is afflicting them more and more.  We can see how they're having a difficult time with their, a Corona fatigue and how they just want to ignore the fact that, you know, if they want things to get back together, they had to make sacrifices, but these people are not willing to make sacrifices.  They're not willing to make sacrifices.  They want everything on a silver platter, which is how it's been.  And then how that silver platter was given was through our labor and through our lands.  So I just like, this was actually a huge, you know, people in the truth can see what's going on.  when, when Max is talking, And especially here, I think they're making it very clear, you know, that they don't want you to talk about the P. and then look at the people in New York who has been, who have been there for years.  I said, I got respect for the brethren who have been there doing the work and everything else.  Okay.  I said, the, their knowledge, especially talking to these Christians and everything else is unmatched.  They're not going to be able to use in the Bible because most people say they're Christians and they love the Bible.  Well, take your information.  And take a look at some of these other videos from the brethren in New York, these other people, you know, other brethren who are doing the work, and compare it to what your pastor's been telling you.  Compare it to what your preacher, you know, or priest has been telling you.  You're going to realize real soon that these pastors and priests have nothing.  That's why most of them are, right now, very quiet.  Because they have nothing.  They're still talking about the Middle East, they're still talking about the rapture, and they're still talking about, you know, all the things going on over there with Ish.  It's still fulfilling prophecy.  And as you can tell, everything this guy just said, Max just said, is fulfilling prophecy right here in the Americas, just like we said it would.  All praise is to the Most High, Yahweh.  Acknowledgement to the Earthly Mother, who is Wisdom, who is the Holy Spirit.  Shalom. ",
