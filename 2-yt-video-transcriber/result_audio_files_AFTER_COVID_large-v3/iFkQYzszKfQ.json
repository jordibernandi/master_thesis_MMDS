How can they get excited about this?  This is really the plan of God for their life.  And if they've really invited Christ into their life, the fact is, this is what He's going to do for them. ",

First of all, for those who are watching this program who disagree with us, And you and I know that there are many people out there who believe that you can lose your faith and so forth, especially if you leave the doctrines and fall away.  And we understand that that is out there and many people believe it.  What we have to do is to realize that the Bible is a consistent book.  And there are some passages that may teach somewhat differently or appear to teach differently, but the Bible is consistent.  And if you look at all the evidence, the fact is that over and over again it teaches that a truly born-again Christian who has received Christ WILL MAKE IT INTO THE HEAVENLY KINGDOM. ",

So don't say to yourself, well, I don't know whether or not I'm chosen.  Don't use that as an excuse.  If God has worked in your heart to bring you to faith, then believe on Him right now, as we're going to give you an opportunity to do at the end of this program. ",

            "text": "Let me mention one other verse that confirms what we've been talking about, and that is John chapter 10.  Jesus talks about the fact that he is the good shepherd, and this is powerful.  He says, My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.  And I give unto them eternal life, and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.  My Father who gave them to me is greater than all, and no one is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand.  I and my Father are  one.\".  At Moody Church years ago, I preached a message entitled, Hands in Harmony.  You have the hand of the Son and the hand of the Father, and they're holding us.  But some people say, yeah, but you know, I can use my free will to wrestle myself out of their hands.  It's not quite that simple.  Because actually, if you are a believer, you are already a member of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.  So despite the fact that sheep sometimes stray.  By the way, could you imagine a shepherd?  He leaves with a hundred sheep in the morning and comes back with 95 at night.  AND THE OTHER SHEPHERDS MOCK HIM, WHAT KIND OF A SHEPHERD ARE YOU?  WELL, YOU DON'T KNOW THESE SHEEP.  THEY WERE SO REBELLIOUS, THEY ACTUALLY WENT THROUGH AND THEY FOLLOWED FALSE PATHS.  I DON'T CARE.  FACT IS, YOU BRING THEM BACK BY HOOK OR BY CROOK, SO THAT AT NIGHTFALL THE HUNDRED SHEEP THAT YOU WERE GIVEN ARE WITHIN THE FOLD. ",
