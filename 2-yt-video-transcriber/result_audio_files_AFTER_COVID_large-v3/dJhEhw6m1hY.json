I used to promote events like your music in the park, and my magazine got sold to the Metro in 2014, 15.  And I have since got formal training and experience as an investigative reporter.  I now work as a freelance investigative reporter with all the mainstream media outlets.  I have been an expert on public records requests, and I am an expert on investigating family courts.  And that has taken us to our local family courts.  And my expertise in most recent months has focused on police misconduct and SB 1421 and public records.  I am currently working on an investigative project that's taken five years.  And this project is going to be covered by mainstream media outlets.  It's going to be a docuseries.  It's going to be widespread media attention.  and Los Gatos is not going to be proud of what we found.  I think the most shocking to me is that I moved here in 2010, and so I'm speaking to you tonight in my personal capacity and my professional capacity.  Ms.  Spector and I have been shocked and appalled at your association with James Towery and Hogue Fenton.  My investigation is focused on private judging, and that will be a separate issue, but the more important issue is the human trafficking issue.  involving an immigrant that is about to becoming an international story.  Our investigation began in 2002 with the indictment of William Dancer, who was fixing traffic court tickets with Los Gatos police members, officers, and members of the Los Gatos Little League.  We then moved to 2007, when the city of Los Gatos and other cities and towns in the county were sued for public records requests, related in the Neymar case, which is a published legal decision and I'm assuming your town council will be addressing these issues.  In 2010, I started investigating domestic violence, sexual assault, child abuse issues in Santa Clara County.  Our child abuse hotline audit shows that the phone wasn't even answered.  And if you're not watching the Netflix documentary series about LA County, you should be.  Because the vicarious liability that is going to come to this town based on what has happened and the international stories that are about to break is significant.  Our investigation focuses on James Towery and Jeff Rosen, but I want you to know that today I spent over six hours trying to get public records from the Los Gatos Police Department, and the city is just simply violating California's Government Code 6253A.  They're not giving me access to records, which I'm entitled to get when I walk into the office.  This is an international story.  you're obstructing media, you're obstructing the press, and you're obstructing a very important investigation.  And this may be a NAMARC case revisited.  So if you have any questions for me, I've documented my journey today.  We posted it live on YouTube.  There's already over 4,000 views on it.  My videos on my YouTube channel are being used by mainstream media for part of this investigation.  It will be a professional production.  And what has gone on in this town.  Ms.  Bassey, your three minutes are up.  We'll look for you on YouTube.  Thank you.  Bye.  Bye. ",

And I thought this would be an excellent opportunity to try to do that a little bit better.  Because you see, private judges are essentially lawyers or retired judges.  Much like these security guards, they are privately paid.  Just as these security guards are paid by Apple, they do not have jurisdiction over the man standing on the sidewalk.  And yet that doesn't prevent these security guards from attempting to breach their jurisdiction.  I caught this one security guard who's standing behind me on the camera putting on gloves as if he intended to go hands-on on the man before they called for the police.  Had we not been there, they might have done just that.  And that's what's happening in our family courts.  These lawyers are acting as judges.  They're dragging divorce cases out for decades.  They're charging families hundreds of thousands of dollars, and they're issuing orders that result in the sale of the family homes and custody of children being taken from parents.  And imagine if you were standing not on a public sidewalk or in a public court, but in one of these secret courts where nobody was watching. ",
