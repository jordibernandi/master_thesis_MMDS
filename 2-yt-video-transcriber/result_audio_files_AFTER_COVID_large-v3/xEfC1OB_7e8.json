Today we're looking at a PureFlix interview with one Dr.  Nathaniel Jensen, who holds a PhD in cell and developmental biology from Harvard.  So if anyone knows enough actual biology to be able to expose the fatal flaws of evolution that some YouTube atheist won't be able to counter, this'll be him.  So let's see how he does. ",

And most of these scientists realize that the science does not necessarily validate their faith.  So they keep the science separate from their religion.  So that's a question that is designed to bring to mind a specific straw man that creationists often use, where they try to convince their parishioners that the mean, nasty atheists think that science and faith can't go together.  But then they show that it can go together because look, here's a guy with a science PhD who is a creationist.  That proves the atheists wrong.  But as with so many things in creationism, this straw man setup is one of those things that will end up causing more atheists than converts.  Because if you grow up learning about a distinction between secular science and creationist science, then when you find out that the creationist science is entirely wrong, you're more likely to just drop your faith entirely than to end up being a Christian who accepts evolution, because you've been told your whole life that it's either evolution and atheism or creation and Christianity.  Demonstrate the truth of evolution, and you have just proven Christianity wrong to such a person.  So ultimately, the false dichotomy does creationists more harm than good, which I'm okay with. ",

Remember when John Morris Pendleton made one of his points by reading the first sentence of the abstract of a study and ignoring the rest of the study?  While it is not always quite as drastic as that, stuff like that is commonplace in creationism.  One sentence of a study will be quoted as if that one sentence is an accurate summary of the study, but usually it turns out that they were pointing out a problem that the study was attempting to solve.  You don't see scientists on the side of evolution behaving this way, so why is it that one side of the argument has to rely almost entirely on misrepresentation?

And yeah, there is a general misconception among non-creationists that creationism is not science because it doesn't make any testable predictions, and so is unfalsifiable.  That is, simply put, not true.  Creationism does make testable predictions that would falsify it.  Unfortunately for creationists, most such predictions were falsified over a century ago, so that's where the misconception comes from.  It hasn't made any new predictions, and the only predictions that it has that have not been falsified are the ones that are unfalsifiable.  So I don't consider creationism to be unscientific because it makes unfalsifiable claims.  I consider it to be unscientific because the claims that it has made have been falsified.

So to answers in Genesis, the idea that the ancient Hebrews used an ancient Hebrew word wrong and modern young earth creationists are the only ones who have figured out the true meaning of the word is more likely than the fact that Genesis describes a solid dome above the earth, you know, because Genesis has to be true.

If it were only a few thousand animals on the ark instead of millions of animals, then there would have to have been a period of rapid evolution the likes of which no evolutionist would ever dream of proposing in order to get from the 7 or 16,000 species to the millions of species that we have today.  In order to get there, if evolution were at a constant rate, there would need to be about 1,500 new species of animal evolving every year for the past 4,000 years.  But we don't see that.  So instead, maybe there was a period of super evolution right after the flood.  Either way, creationist models predict way more evolution than any of the evolutionist models. ",

So whether or not they were aware of specifically which version of creationism evolution was supposed to have countered is irrelevant.

If it were merely a matter of interpretation, you would expect there to be some organizations that are not religiously affiliated also opposing evolution.  But alas, there are none. ",

Creationists have frequently been gleeful about the fact that Darwin thought cells were some homogenous gelatinous substance, that they were much simpler than they actually are.  The study of cells and their contents is where we find a plethora of the modern evidence for evolution.  I can't believe you could possibly get through Harvard's PhD program without learning this.  So that can't just be you being misinformed or ignorant.  That has to be a lie.  Will he accurately describe an evolutionary position without building a straw man?  To find out, tune in tomorrow.
