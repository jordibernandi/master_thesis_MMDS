I'm black and I hate when people tell me what to do.  That's it.  That's like black conservatism in a nutshell.  You can sound racist all you want.  Every single black person in this chat will agree with me on this.  Every black Republican is only a Republican because they hate being told what to do.  That's the only thing they say over and over again.  You talk to any black conservative, you debate any black conservative, I've debated a lot of black conservatives, as you all know, from Larry Elder to Gianno Caldwell, and it's always the same shit.  You can't tell me what to do.  And for those of you who are saying Christianity is a big reason, abso- Absolutely not.  No.  Black Democrats are still very Christian.  Black Democrats are still some of the most conservative voters that we have, especially older black Democrats.  Absolutely not.  It has nothing to do with Christianity, okay?  It has everything to do with, like, going against the grain and hating that, like, you know, you were told that you were a Democrat your entire life because you're black.  And, like, that's why you're just... They literally always say, like, oh, well, you know, I'm... You know, you can't tell me what to do.
