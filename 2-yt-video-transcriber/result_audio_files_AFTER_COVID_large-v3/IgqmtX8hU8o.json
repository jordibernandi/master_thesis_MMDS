But Cori Bush has been tearing it up on on air since before she got elected.  But pretty much since she won her primary and really showing the world what so many of us saw in her for the last several years.  But Cori Bush won on The View every single time she goes on.  I'm like, I don't know how you could get better than that.  And she outdoes herself.  Nobody outdoes.  She outdoes herself.  I think she got Meghan McCain a little teary-eyed.  And that's a special kind of superpower.  So let's roll that clip real quick. ",

That hope is on the inside of you.  Now remember this, we don't go by what happens externally.  That shouldn't shake what's happening on the inside of us.  We have to stand strong no matter what the adversity, no matter what it looks like.  Our faith has to be the core of everything that we do.  And our faith in action is how we make change.

Every single time I got my paycheck and I had $20 left over and I still had to take care of my kids and pay daycare and all of this, and I had $20 left over, I didn't lose hope.  I worked on me.  And so, no, don't lose hope right now.  Dr.  King's legacy was not about sitting back and allowing other people to do the work.  His legacy was not about letting someone else dictate how we should feel.  His legacy was about making sure that a dignity and a quality of life for each and every person was available.  I am an instrument of peace.  That's what you should be saying.  I am an instrument of peace.  I bring everything that I have, every gift, every talent, every skill, bring that to the forefront and put that to this movement.  And so what we can all do is we can do our part to make this an anti-racist society.  And that means not just talking to, you know, not just saying I have a black friend or, you know, I help out, you know, I help my Palestinian friends and I do.  No, no, no.  We're talking about talking to your friends and then your block, talking to your people in your religious affiliation or your groups, whatever you're doing, talking to them at your job, at the company you own, making the effort, putting a real in like some real intention behind that.  Making this an anti-racist country.  And so what and how are we also doing that?  We got to make sure people have health care.  Every single person deserves health care. ",

For me, personally, it makes me feel good to see a Black woman like that who really is from that element of just not having much to be put in these positions.  And we know what she stands for when it comes to policies.  And you just feel it.  Like, I just feel it.  So I feel it in my heart when she speaks, you know what I'm saying?  Like, just because I feel like it comes from the right place.  And, you know, I don't have that thing where I believe that she really means what she's gonna follow through to with her actions.  So she's doing it right, and we need that energy.  I'm so glad that that energy is in Congress, and I want more of it to come in because that's what's going to save us at the end of the day at that level.

There are plenty of people who have run that have gone through hardship, that are in office, that have gone through hardship.  Believe it or not.  I mean, yes, the average congressperson is a millionaire, but there are absolutely across this country.  But they're calcified by the system.  And what I find so.  So moving about Corey is that she has run multiple times.  She's fought the system.  The last day of her last election before this one, because she ran before, her car was repossessed.  And it just motivated her more to run.  It's like every obstacle that she faced along the way from the establishment, from, you know, nobody groomed her.  She did it on her own.  And it's just.  she's to me is emblematic of like exactly like.  she's the flip opposite of what our system is.  And she's using her personal stories to convince people like Meghan McCain to support progressive policies.  And Joshua, you talk about storytelling all the way.  And all I could hear in in her speaking was these stories are moving people that aren't even in our space. ",

And she's telling stories and then immediately going to.  and now let's talk about anti-racism and now let's talk about health care and using them to motivate people to actually be able to dream about something different, which is also the opposite of like the bedtime stories.  the society tells itself where, you know, how many times have you heard someone say, oh, well, I've pulled myself up by my bootstraps and I and I came from nothing.  And that's why we should keep the system exactly like it is now.  Because I made it, so therefore, if you didn't make it, it's your fault.  It's literally the opposite point of that.  It's drawing the inner resources of struggle to be able to have vision in a way that's honest.  It's like what Napoleon was saying.  You feel what she's saying in your body, and you feel the honesty and clarity and the truth of what she's saying. ",
