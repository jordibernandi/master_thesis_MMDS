It makes no difference to me whether she spent it on blow or sent it to the Vatican.  The point is, she shortchanged a lot of poor dying people.  It's ironic that she was giving a talk to social workers, because when Christopher Hitchens talked to her, she told him, I'm not a social worker.  He said that she assured me that she wasn't working to alleviate poverty, she was working to expand the number of Catholics.  And Dr.  Ray is entirely right that what Mother Teresa did, withholding medicine and better lodging conditions from the poor and dying because she thought their suffering is good for the world, and proselytizing to the vulnerable and desperate to increase the number of Catholics, is probably not something very many atheists would do.
