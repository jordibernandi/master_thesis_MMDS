            "text": "Blessed Good Friday to you.  I hope you're enjoying this magnificent day.  The message of Good Friday, there's just nothing like it.  I want to exhort you just a few moments concerning a vision that God has given to me for the last couple of years.  But during this Passover, The last couple of days, it has been a reoccurring vision again with a little change to it.  Micah 2.13 tells us that Messiah, the breaker, will go before us and we will break through.  And of course, that's what Passover weekend is about.  Awesome breakthrough.  Our King, Messiah, came to give us breakthrough.  But the last couple of years, I've had a reoccurring vision of breakthrough angels that minister the anointing of our king and his breakthrough for us.  It was rather unique.  I saw it in Vancouver, various places across Canada, and then the United States, and of course here at the Oasis.  But in this vision, I would see these mighty angels and they had a long like you would use to strike at a county fair or something.  You would strike the bell and it would go up and ring the bell using this big wooden mallet, like a sledgehammer, only it was wooden.  And they were striking the ground.  And when they struck the ground, it was like I could feel the ground shake.  It was such a thud.  But each time they struck the ground, they would decree a word.  they would decree, break up, break out, break through, and they just kept doing that.  And I saw this vision several times over the last couple of years, break up, break out, break through, and these angels were striking the ground.  The last couple of days, that has changed.  Holy Spirit has added to that and added a couple of words to what the angels have been saying, and I've never heard this before, but in this vision, the last couple of days, I have seen these breakthrough angels, and they are striking the ground again, and I can feel the ground shaking.  It's a very powerful strike, but now Holy Spirit has added these two words, Break up, break out, break through, Passover, possess.  I have never heard those two words, Passover and possess.  And I believe it's speaking to us prophetically right now.  We are in a breakthrough season.  This is a very special Passover.  It literally is a Passover season where we are going to break out.  We're breaking out of this pandemic in Jesus' name.  We're breaking through this diabolical attack of hell that has struck us.  We're breaking up the barriers of hell and his kingdom against us.  And we are passing over and we are possessing.  This is a time when we are going to win and we're going to win very big.  We're not just going to, we're not just going to break out, but we are going to possess new territory.  We are going to possess new inheritance.  We are going to win a victory for King Jesus like has not been seen before.  And breakthrough.  angels are being activated by the Holy Spirit right now in this Passover season so that we break out in such a way that we begin to run with Messiah the breaker, running under the supervision of the Holy Spirit and running with angel armies.  Why?  To take new territory, to possess, to possess the land, to possess new territories and to reap the the greatest harvest King Jesus has ever received in all of our kingdom history.  This Passover season is special.  It is now breakthrough time.  We have just entered into it.  I believe the starting gun has been shot.  And it's time for us to move now forward into the greatest days in church history.  What the adversary thought he would use to cause us to back up has really caused us just to reset, refocus, and now move forward.  So be encouraged today.  We are more than overcoming.  Greater is he that's in us.  This day is a day when we'll mark in history.  When God said, all right, now let's pass over.  And now let's possess new land.  That's our promise.  And we're going to live it in Jesus name.  So I bless you today.  Confess this word with me.  And let's see.  Let's see the great breakup, breakout, breakthrough.  And let's see the Passover and the possession of new territory. ",
