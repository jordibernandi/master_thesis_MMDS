            "text": "Well, it's going to depend on the situation.  What I actually believe is that these sort of peaceful yet offensive approaches are massively underutilized.  In a previous installment, we talked about whether it's appropriate for Christians to mock other people's beliefs in certain circumstances.  And if we're answering from a biblical perspective, yes, God mocked people in the Old Testament.  The prophets did.  Jesus did.  Paul did.  It depended on the situation.  But mockery was definitely one approach in certain circumstances.  And what you find biblically is that it kind of depends on what the target is, but usually it's oppressors or religious leaders who are leading other people astray.  These were... biblically appropriate targets for mockery.  Now, this is kind of a different realm.  This is more in the realm of something like desecration.  I think you could make some sort of case, you know, someone made an idol and Moses grinds it up and makes people drink it and something like that.  But really, I'm just thinking in terms of What is a peaceful response to certain situations?  And what we find is that in Islam, Islam actually has built into it a means of controlling inappropriate behavior from its adherents.  And this is found in Surah 6, verse 108 of the Quran.  The verse just basically says, don't insult the gods of the pagans lest they insult Allah in return.  So there are Muslims who use this and say, see, Islam doesn't promote insulting other people's religions.  It's actually false.  There are all kinds of situations where Islam insults the beliefs of other people.  But if you look at the historical background, it becomes clear what was going on.  Muhammad and his companions were actually the instigators of this campaign of insulting and degrading and mocking the gods and goddesses of the polytheists of Mecca.  And the polytheists did not want to retaliate.  They just kept trying to, hey, could you stop it for this?  Could you stop that?  We're asking you.  We're asking you nicely.  We'll offer you things.  Is there anything we can do here?  And the Muslims just wouldn't stop.  So finally, the polytheists said... If you don't stop insulting our gods and goddesses, we're going to start insulting your god and your religion, your prophet.  And that's when the revelation came down.  OK, if they're going to start insulting you back, then stop with the insults.  So the principle here is if you're insulting and heaping abuse on someone, that's actually fine.  But if they're going to retaliate by insulting your religion, then stop with it.  So that's built into Islam, right?  As long as you can get away with insulting and abusing other people's beliefs and other people.  then do it.  But if it's going to lead people to insult in return, then stop that.  Now, I think this has all kinds of applications.  If you have like the Charlie Hebdo massacre where jihadis are killing people over cartoons, If in that situation, the response from the international community where, hey, if you're going to kill people over cartoons, then we're all going to make cartoons.  Well, guess what?  That would send a message that this is not the way to get what you want.  And this will actually lead to further mockery of your beliefs, not to less.  You're not threatening people into being quiet on this.  Um, so it could actually be more effective and lead to less bloodshed.  And it's a piece, you know, we, we, we, it's, it's a peaceful approach.  It's a peaceful response rather than this endless cycle of bloodshed where they go and kill and then they get killed in return and so on.  So you have those kinds of situations, but a recent application was some online Muslims, um, started a campaign where they said, we're not going after the critics of Islam now.  We're going after their wives.  So they started going after people's wives.  In other words, if you're an online critic of Islam, they would look up your wife wife on Facebook or something like that, take pictures and start posting very, very nasty and obscene comments, hinting at rape and torture and all the things they're going to do to them and so on.  And the intention was clear.  It's, hey, even though you may be a fearless person, you don't want someone abusing your wife.  And so we can actually control your behavior by going after your wives and family members and things like that.  So that was a situation where I thought this is a perfect opportunity.  place where you would want to implement surah 6 verse 108. hey if you're going to be insulting people's wives and attacking people's wives then i will go after your religion in response.  and so do you actually want to go this route?  so we were reading through one of these comments that was just saturated with imagery of rape and torture towards someone's wife and i said look if you want to go this route.  here's what i'm going to do.  i took a. The insults towards people's wives immediately stopped.  They stopped.  I'm still demanding that they take down some old tweets and so on.  So this sort of approach is going to continue until everything is removed and they understand forever that you don't take that approach.  But they all got the message.  Oh, if they're going to go in this direction, then we need to stop this.  And so in my view, I understand, hey, we don't want to do this.  We don't want to do this childish nonsense of... Going through this process of desecration and so on.  But on the other hand, I'm thinking, look, if there's ever a situation, these guys say, hey, we're going to start this online campaign going after all of your wives, insulting all of your wives, threatening all of all of your wives.  If that's not a situation where you say, no, actually, you won't because your book.  Your book tells me how to make you stop.  And if you give me a peaceful way of making you stop, I'm going to make you stop.  If there's any situation like that, then I think this would be the kind of situation.  And it works.  So, again, I think it's debatable.  And I wouldn't encourage all Christians to do that.  But I think someone needs to do that. ",

I mean, it's unfortunate that the role can get so corrupt that we would have to see this kind of accusations happen toward, you know, people's wives and stuff like that.  Hopefully there is a peaceful path.  I know you, and I know that your ultimate goal would be to help us to be more at peace, but you'll take more of a challenging approach if it means getting the peace that you're after. ",
