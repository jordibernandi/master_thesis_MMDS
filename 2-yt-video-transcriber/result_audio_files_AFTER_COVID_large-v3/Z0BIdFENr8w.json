            "text": "People are predicting the rapture will happen soon, but does the Bible really say Christians will not face tribulation?  It's time to unlearn the lies.  Hey, welcome to Unlearn.  My name is Lex, and I'd like to invite you to join us each week as we unlearn the lies and dig deeper into the truth of God's word.  Now let's get started.  There are thousands of videos on YouTube about people having rapture dreams and predicting the rapture will happen in 2020.  So many people are talking about the rapture these days.  Current events seem to be lining up with what the Bible says will happen before the tribulation, and they conclude that the rapture will happen soon.  However, I'm concerned these people are being led astray into believing they won't face the tribulation.  Yeshua spoke about people falling away because of tribulation in the parable of the sower.  But he who received the seed on stony places This is he who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy.  Yet he has no root in himself, but endures only for a while.  For when tribulation or persecution arises because of the word, immediately he stumbles.  This parable is talking about believers who fall away when tribulation comes.  Why would believers fall away or stumble in their faith when tribulation happens?  This could easily happen for someone who has put their faith in the rapture and is not expecting to face tribulation.  I've heard people say things like, I don't need to learn about the tribulation because I'm not going to be around.  I'm going to be raptured before it happens.  I'm seriously concerned about what will happen to their faith when tribulation happens and they haven't been raptured.  In Matthew 24, Yeshua warned believers about false teachers, false prophets, false Christs, deception and tribulation.  Why would he need to warn believers about those things if we aren't going to be around to see those things happen?  Now as he sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately saying, tell us when will these things be and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?  And Jesus answered and said unto them, take heed that no one deceives you.  for many will come in my name saying i am the christ and will deceive many and you will hear of wars and rumors of wars.  see that you are not troubled for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet for nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom.  there will be famines pestilence earthquakes in various places.  all these are the beginning of sorrows.  then they will deliver you up to tribulation and kill you.  you will be hated by all nations for my name's sake.  he said take heed that no one deceives you.  and he also said they will deliver you up to tribulation and kill you.  Do you believe the words of Yeshua?  He was giving us a warning for a reason.  The only way you can believe in a pre-tribulation rapture is if you don't believe the words of Christ.  He makes it very clear that He does not come to gather His people until after the tribulation.  Immediately after the tribulation of those days, the sun will be darkened and the moon will not give its light.  The stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of heaven will be shaken.  Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.  And he will send his angels with the great sound of a trumpet.  and they will gather together his elect from the four winds from one end of heaven to the  other.\".  The elect are not gathered to meet the Lord until after the tribulation.  This means believers will go through the tribulation.  Tribulation can also be translated as persecution, affliction, trouble, or distress.  It's the Greek word, thlipsis, and actually refers to a narrow place that hems someone in.  Think about when Moses led Israel out of Egypt.  They had the mountains closing them in on a narrow path and the Egyptians behind them and the Red Sea in front of them.  They were trapped.  This is a picture of tribulation.  And through tribulation, Israel learned to trust the Lord.  In the book of Acts, Stephen spoke about God delivering Joseph out of tribulation.  And the patriarchs, becoming envious, sold Joseph into Egypt.  But God was with him and delivered him out of all his tribulation, and gave him favor and wisdom in the presence of Pharaoh king of Egypt.  And he made him governor over Egypt and all his house.  Now a famine and a great tribulation came over all the land of Egypt and Canaan, and our fathers found no sustenance.  Joseph was betrayed by his brothers, sold into slavery, falsely accused, and thrown into prison.  He didn't escape tribulation.  He faced it.  But God delivered him from his tribulation.  Deliverance means being rescued or set free.  God is our deliverer.  He rescues us from our tribulation and our bondage.  He will be our deliverer in the time of great tribulation as well.  That's why Yeshua said, When these things begin to happen, look up, lift up your heads, because your redemption draws near.  The disciples were preaching and teaching the people that we must go through tribulation to enter the Kingdom of God.  Strengthening the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to continue in the faith, and saying we must through many tribulations enter the kingdom of God.  By telling people they will face tribulation, we strengthen them and prepare them to face those trials.  It's important to strengthen our faith so that when we face persecution and tribulation, we will hold on to our faith and endure to the end.  And you will be hated by all for my name's sake, but he who endures to the end will be saved.  This is the major problem I see with people teaching about a pre-tribulation rapture.  They're not preparing people to face persecution.  They're not strengthening their faith so they will be able to endure the tribulation.  This is why in the parable of the sower some fall away when tribulation comes.  They aren't prepared for tribulation.  Their faith isn't strong enough to endure it and they will fall away.  Yeshua said that in this world we will have tribulation.  But he told us about the salvation that will come in the end, so that we can have peace through the persecution.  These things I have spoken to you, that in me you may have peace.  In the world you will have tribulation, but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.  Paul explained that tribulation is actually a good thing, because it strengthens us and builds our character.  He also said it produces hope.  And not only that, but we also glory in tribulations.  knowing that tribulation produces perseverance, and perseverance character, and character hope.  How does tribulation give us hope?  Tribulation means our redemption draws near.  Our Messiah will soon return and we will finally see Him face to face.  Listen to these encouraging words from Paul, Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?  Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?  as it is written, For your sakes we are killed all day long.  We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.  Yet in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us.  For I am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels nor principalities, nor powers nor things present nor things to come, nor height nor depth nor any other created thing, shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.  We have hope in times of tribulation.  Keep your faith and endure to the end, and wait in expectation for the Lord to return and rescue His people.
