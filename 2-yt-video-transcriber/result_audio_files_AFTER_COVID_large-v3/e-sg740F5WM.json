Now, One thing that bothered me was that, that, you know, so-called friend of his that was sitting next to him, you know, he definitely fit that definition of, you know, what we call a Sambo for sure.  Because I heard the little things that he was saying to this woman.  I'm like, are you serious, brother?  Are you saying these things to this woman?  Are you looking at this woman?  I mean, seriously, she aged like a banana.  Okay.  That's how she's looking.  She looking bad out here.  That's why she's so hateful is because she can't pull nobody.  So she want to go harass brothers.  That's not even bothering her.  And I told you guys about those Karens is that they're dangerous because they come where we at minding our own business.  And then they start messing with you and then you retaliate.  Now they don't call the police and say, Oh, well he, you know, he verbally abused me.  you know, he did this, he did that.  And they want to come running and just believe in her automatically when she's sitting out there, you know, could be lying about everything.  Okay.  This video, you know, really, you know, annoyed me a lot because the dude is trying to get you away from him.  Leave them alone.  Nobody called you over there.  But yet she feels that, you know, she owns America because that comes with her entitlement that she can go wherever she wants.  She can say whatever she wants to whomever she wants.  Right.  And also there'll be no pushback.  And she knows she was wrong because she would acknowledge, Oh, you will make me like a Karen because you are a Karen, right?  That's why you said it.  Nobody even mentioned the word Karen to you.  You acting that way.  And yet you continue to act that way.  Even though this guy have a camera in your face, you still act that way.  She got no act right whatsoever.  And this is why many people like her lose a job.  Because like I said, they don't have a high IQ folks.  They keep losing their jobs.  They keep seeing what's causing it and they keep going right back to it.  I mean, like I said before, it's like when they see us, they see red.  And they got to go sit over there and mess with us some way, uh, you know, form of fashion when it's not enough of us.  I'm saving just a few of us.  He definitely go over there.  So, you know, those brothers, you don't need to be careful out there with these Karens because they are just as dangerous as you know, the men in their community when he joined certain groups. ",
