            "text": "For over a hundred years, the ballrooms of New York have been host to extravagant, exciting, and sometimes secret queer dance parties.  It's a world where people who faced incredible obstacles in life could relax and unwind and live out their fantasies.  And it was also a world that, for many decades, was hidden, erased, or even dangerous to document.  But now all that's changed.  Not only are we fortunate enough to have newly restored footage of balls from decades past, but people in the scene are creating their own documentaries.  And by looking across old docs like Paris is Burning and new ones like Kiki, we can start to reconstruct the history of queer dance parties and ask, after 50 years of ballroom, how much has changed, and how much is still the same as it was decades ago.  All aboard and welcome to Matt Baume's Culture Cruise!  In recent videos we took a look at the documentaries The Queen from 1968 and Paris is Burning from 1990, and this time we're jumping ahead another 25 years from Paris is Burning to see what came next.  The documentary Kiki from 2016 captures a relatively new scene where young queer people are creating the next generation of ballroom.  By the way, Culture Cruise is made possible thanks to patrons like Rusty O'Neill, Carol Poult, and Jessica Schuch.  If you're enjoying these videos, head over to patreon.com slash matt baume to check out the rewards for backers.  Now, before we get started, let's do a quick recap on the history of ballroom.  And if you want more detail, you can watch my videos on the Queen and Paris is Burning.  The short version is that the scene evolved out of elaborate balls starting in the 1800s, where people, often people of color, would dress up in what today we would call drag.  Those balls grew in popularity through the 1920s, but then there was a backlash, a moral panic.  And for a time, dressing in drag and going to balls was a crime.  Years passed, and queer people were increasingly the target of the police, the medical establishment, and society in general.  During that time, a ton of queer culture was lost, sometimes because it was erased with regulations that banned so-called perversion in films, or because it was simply too dangerous for queer people to openly express themselves.

You've probably noticed that some of the terms in these older docs are not the words that we use today, like how Queens at Heart talks about getting a sex change.  Fifty years ago, the word transgender had only just been coined, and there wasn't commonly agreed-on language for all the different ways that someone can express their gender.  But even though the language wasn't as precise, that didn't mean people in the community didn't understand themselves.  At one point in Queens at Heart, the interviewer calls an interviewee, Simone, effeminate.  And she actually schools him on how his terminology is what we would today call problematic. ",

That's certainly not something that's changed in 50 years.  And it's one reason why Kiki is so important and different from those earlier documentaries.  To be clear, I like Paris is Burning.  It is a visually beautiful movie, the people in it are fascinating, and it broke through to the mainstream to reach people who might never otherwise have thought about queer culture at all.  It's possible that modern shows like Drag Race wouldn't even be talking about shade and reading without Paris is Burning, if those modern shows even existed at all. ",

And I think that's an incredibly powerful and important achievement.  I also like The Queen and Queens at Heart.  Those docs were made at a time when queer life was simply not spoken of.  You could be sent to jail or labeled mentally ill just for not conforming to traditional gender roles.  So I think it's incredibly brave for the people in those films to have shared their stories.  Now, that having been said, Paris is Burning, The Queen, and Queens at Heart were all made by people from outside the scene that they were documenting.  So in contrast, the team that made Kiki included folks like Twiggy.  As a result, I can have more confidence that documentaries like Kiki are depicting people authentically, that they're not being misrepresented.  But I also find Kiki a little bit harder to relate to than other docs.  Paris is Burning, The Queen, and Queens at Heart all spend a lot more time explaining things and defining terms. ",

But my guess is that the people who made Kiki already know that their audience has seen Paris is Burning or they're familiar with Ballroom.  We already know the basics, so Kiki doesn't have to retread the same ground.  Instead, it can build on what's come before.  Those older docs you can think of as being like Ballroom 101.  And Kiki's like Ballroom 102.  And it can be that because it's being made by people who know the scene firsthand.  That documentaries are being made about Ballroom isn't new.  That's been happening for generations.  But what's changed is who gets to tell those stories.  For a really complete understanding of Ballroom's history, you should check out more media from people who are in the scene.  Stuff like the YouTube channel Ballroom Throwbacks, the BET series Queer as Fuck, and the show My House.  And of course, follow people who are icons in the scene, like Leomi Maldonado, MJ Rodriguez, and of course, Dominique Jackson.  The more you look back across the story of ballroom 100 years ago, 50, 25, today, you can see so much that's changed.  The buildings, the families, the terminology, the hair.  And now, who gets to tell the story?  But underneath all those things, the people themselves have remained remarkably consistent from one generation to the next to the next. ",
