            "text": "So Hollywood has decided to jump in full scale and make mockeries of themselves.  So I'm old enough to remember when two weeks ago, Madonna had her son dancing in the kitchen to Michael Jackson.  We were all mocking this, like, oh, racism solved, guys, racism solved.  But now all of Hollywood is engaged in the Madonna son dancing to Michael Jackson in the kitchen.  That's what we now have.  So yesterday, a bunch of very woke and very self-righteous Hollywood celebrities, including people like Aaron Paul and Kristen Bell and Sarah Paulson, did a video for itakeresponsibility.org in which they announced that they were taking responsibility for all the world's sins.  They're like the Jesus of this moment.  They're going to take responsibility of all the world's sins on their shoulder, and then they will rectify the imbalances in the universe by doing so.  Now, I will say that for a bunch of actors, they don't do very good performances, except for Aaron Paul, who really dials this up to 11.  At the end of this video, he goes full Jesse Pinkman.  By the end of this video, Aaron Paul is basically screaming at the camera about police brutality and how the police are murdering people.  And Julianna Moore suggests that black people are being slaughtered in the streets by police.  I mean, it really is some very solid stuff from Hollywood.  But you can tell that for a lot of these stars, the thing has become a grift simply because they're doing what they are doing.  And I don't doubt the sincerity of their feeling about black people dying because every decent person feels that.  I do doubt the sincerity of putting out a video where they take responsibility for all the world's sins and suggest that they will never, ever, ever tell a bad joke ever again.  Oh, they won't tell a bad joke ever again.  Or, oh, they won't stand by and watch police brutality.  Were they members of the PD?  Were they standing by?  Were they like there at the George Floyd killing?  Because I don't remember Sarah Paulson there.  And I feel like that would have been a big news story if Sarah Paulson had been there and just been standing by doing nothing.  In any case, here was the video from these Hollywood stars pledging that they take responsibility.  Now, be fair about this.  When you're a Hollywood star and you say, I take responsibility, what you're actually saying is I do not take responsibility for any of this stuff.  What you're actually saying is everybody else is the bad guy.  I'm the good guy.  And the way you can tell I'm the good guy is because of my performative atonement.  My performative atonement means I'm not like those other white people.  And this video is like all white people.  The entire video is a bunch of white people saying I take responsibility, which really means I don't take responsibility.  I'm one of the good ones, guys.  I'm a good one.  I'm the kind of person who would plywood up my window and then spray paint Black Lives Matter on it.  That's the kind of person these actors are.  Don't please don't break into my mansion because the fact is that I am with you.  I am with you.  All the way up until the point when it actually comes to sacrificing my part for a person of color, then I'm not so into it.  But like right now in front of this camera, the reason this is important, guys, is because you can see, again, what began as a sincere outpouring of upset over George Floyd and police brutality has become for so many people an opportunity to virtue signal on behalf of their own sort of political cadre and their insidery Hollywood cronies.  Here was this video yesterday.  It's astonishingly bad. ",

What are you talking about?  What are you talking about?  Also, I'm really looking forward to the... professional cut of all the various jokes that these various actors have told in the course of their careers that apparently they don't like anymore.  Recognize that one of the people who's being most sincere is Justin Theroux.  Justin Theroux wrote Tropic Thunder, in which Robert Downey Jr.  plays a black man and tells nothing but racist, stereotypical jokes for two hours.  Okay, so I'm going to go with, you guys didn't care about any of this stuff until you decided that it was worthwhile virtue signaling about it.  The sincerity of... I'm here without makeup and I haven't shaved either.  That means that I am totally sincere, guys.  Now, I'm not going to stop this video until we get to Aaron Paul.  My colleague, Matt Walsh, he had a great line about this yesterday.  He called it the I take responsibility challenge.  How long can you get through this video before you have to turn it off?  But we have to.  we have to continue this video until we at least get to Aaron Paul's Oscar worthy performance.  as very concerned white person. ",

            "text": "I'm sorry.  That one, actually, I have to stop just to rebut it.  OK, the notion that black people are being slaughtered in their own homes by the cops is just nonsense.  It's just nonsense.  It is not true.  The fact is that the police shot last year, according to The Washington Post, one thousand and four people, about 250 of them were black.  Nearly all of them were armed and resisting the police.  Black people are not being slaughtered en masse by white people in their beds.  And Dave Chappelle put out a comedy special.  And Dave Chappelle's a comedian.  He can obviously say what he wants.  He's a comedian, right?  He can make whatever jokes he wants.  I'm not in favor of censorship of comedians or chiding them for the sorts of language they use or something like that.  That's comedy.  But Dave Chappelle makes a serious point in which he suggests that anyone who survives this nightmare is a hero.  And I just think to myself, okay, there are 42 million black Americans.  41,992,500 of them were not shot last year.  And of the remaining 7,500 who were shot, the vast majority were killed by other black people in the black community.  because nearly all murder in the United States is intraracial, not interracial.  And only 250 were shot by the cops at all.  And only nine were shot unarmed.  So that does not sound like every day.  black people are under existential threat in the United States because they clearly are not.  I mean, Dave Chappelle is a very, very wealthy person.  LeBron James is a very, very wealthy person.  He's done very, very well for himself.  Good for them.  This is America.  Everybody should have the opportunity to do really well for themselves, which is why we all stand against police brutality.  But this notion that black people are being slaughtered en masse is so ahistorical.  And by the way, degrading to history, to history's actual evils.  I mean, you want to talk about the mistreatment of black people?  You don't have to go all that far back in American history to talk about mass mistreatment of black people.  To compare today's black experience to the black experience of 1960 with legalized segregation and Jim Crow and miscegenation laws, or to compare it to slavery, is utterly asinine.  And to take that crap from Julianne Moore, who's whiter than this piece of paper right here, is beyond me.  Anyway, we finally get to Aaron Paul, Oscar winner Aaron Paul, in his finest performance.  And killer cops must be prosecuted.  They are murderers. ",

            "text": "It is time to take responsibility.  Call out hate.  Step up.  I realize why they cast Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman, because he actually is Jesse Pinkman.  He's just Jesse Pinkman.  Like there is no other Aaron Paul.  It's not like he was putting it on when he was doing it.  He really dials that spinal tap 11 there for Aaron Paul.  OK, so the point of this is not that this is important.  The point is that it is frivolously unimportant.  And we have reached the point of frivolous unimportance in this debate.  We have.  Remember, this thing started off as how do we enact police reform so as to quash police brutality?  How do we do that?  Has anybody talked about any of that like in the last week?  In the last week and a half, Congress was pushing a bill.  Does anyone know what was in that bill?  Does anyone care?  The answer, of course, is no.  The media are covered with other narratives, with other narratives.  And the problem for the press and the problem for the left is that once you broaden out the narrative from Americans need to care about kill black people, which we all do, to.  we're going to tear down statues of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson and set up autonomous zones in Seattle.  Americans are like, you know what?  I'm out.  Once you move from we all ought to care about black people being victimized by police brutality.  to every white person is guilty of systemic racism in this country.  And you must kneel and you must atone and you must put out a corporate statement or we're going to boycott you.  Americans like, you know what?  Done.  We're out.  We're out because you have now moved beyond the point of the rational.  We are not going to wear the ribbon just because you say that we're supposed to wear the ribbon.  We may agree with the cause, but we are not going to be forced into Hollywood hostage videos.  This is not something that we are into.  And you can see the narrative turning because the left always goes too far.  They can't just say, here's a wrong.  How do we work to correct it?  Because that might be too unifying.  They refuse to be specific.  Instead, you're supposed to swallow this entire narrative hook, line, and sinker.  And I don't think that most Americans are willing to swallow the narrative that black people are systemically put upon by police in the United States and at threat of violence every single day, or that all white people in the United States are responsible for the subjugation of black people, which is why there is inequality between groups.  I don't think most Americans believe that because it isn't true.  It isn't factually true.  I hope you enjoyed that clip from The Ben Shapiro Show.
