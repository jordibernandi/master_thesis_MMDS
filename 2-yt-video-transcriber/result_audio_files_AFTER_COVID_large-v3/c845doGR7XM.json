Tying herself up in knots trying to answer questions from Andrew Neil on the Andrew Neil Show.  She has lambasted for many reasons including support of Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour Party policies, claims Labour could never win an election if they moved to the centre, and of course, says the British public was not intellectually capable of understanding their policies the way the Labour Party put them forward.  Which means, yes guys, the Labour Party still think you're too stupid to know what you voted for.  So let's check out what she had to say on the Andrew Neil Show. ",

And he's already scurrying her from the very beginning, asking her what crisis has she actually dealt with, because as leader of the country, you might have to deal with one.  And given her answer, I think she was coached by Diane Abbott for this interview, because it's not based in reality.  She claims to have dealt with a crisis relating to the so-called climate crisis, when, as Andrew Neil points out to her, you were in opposition.  So you were just writing out policies that meant zero to anyone except for you, of course.  it was just a way to make it look like you were actually doing something when we all know there is literally nothing you or anyone in the labour party can do.  the conservatives are in government.  they decide policy.  end of story.  i do love how she claims.  I do love how she claims writing those policies was actually tackling the crisis, when no, you really wasn't.  The government of the time are tackling the crisis.  If Labour was to have won the election, do you think they would let the Tories decide policy?  Does she really think the people of the UK are that stupid?  Oh wait, actually, yes she does, as we will hear later in this interview.  But I would say Rebecca Long-Bailey in that clip proved she has never tackled a crisis and was doing the age-old Labour trick of just talking complete bullshit.

I love how many times he pulls her up on it refusing to let her get away with talking the complete nonsense that she did.  He asked you to provide evidence.  moving to the centre would never win you an election.  when as we all know and the evidence states that you heard Andrew Neil read out, the Labour Party, under a centrist kind of leader in Tony Blair, won three in a row, while ever since then they've moved further left and ended up losing four consecutive elections, which I'm pretty sure will be at least six before they stand any chance of actually winning anything.  Her argument that looking at the declining vote share for Labour after the last 20 years only goes against what she is saying more and more.  Just over 20 years ago Tony Blair won the election.  Now obviously since his first election it's going to drop for however long he stays in office until eventually he resigns or leaves.  Then of course it changes over.  This is the way the British political system works.  They have a couple of terms, sometimes three, and then it switches to the other party.  Almost like clockwork.  So her decline in vote share answer is nonsense as Andrew Neil points out.  With this time being different to the past, we may not see a Labour government, in my opinion, for a very long time.  Especially if any of these lunatics are the leader for very long.  It goes to show just how ideologically deluded she and the Corbynistas really are.

She's been running around claiming she was the solicitor for the NHS.  when in actual fact she worked for a law firm that was helping to sell off parts of the nhs under the pfi deals that tony blair put in meaning she directly profited from the nhs being sold to a luxembourg consortium 190 million pounds of it in total.  That's not her making 190 million pounds, that's how much the contracts were worth.  Imagine running around spouting all this crap about the Tories selling off the NHS when you were one of the people who directly benefited from that happening, which as we all know was a Labour government who started it.  It's rather funny how these Labour MPs forget what they did in the past when they need to get elected.  I wonder what else these lowlifes have been running around lying about.  Actually, I think from now on, I will just take everything they say as a lie until proven otherwise.  It's probably the best way to go about it, I think you will agree.  But during that interview, Andrew O'Neill absolutely destroyed her.  Not that he really had to because she provided us with a car crash interview all on her own.  Her answers were either nonsensical and not relevant or outright talking complete bullshit.  Which I have to say was a theme throughout the 30 minute interview.  I just included a couple of minutes here to get the essentials from it which is all you really need to see.  It was a complete shit show.  But no more than we have come to expect from the snivelling shit weasels that are the Labour Party.  But on that note guys, I am going to end the video there.  Now before I go, I've started doing live streams and uploading gaming content on my second channel.
