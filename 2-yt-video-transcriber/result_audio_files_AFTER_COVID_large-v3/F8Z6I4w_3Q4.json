I'm on a public sidewalk.  You can keep on moving.  This is a public easement.  Do whatever you want.  This is a public easement.  I'm not talking to you no more.  It's public easement.  Anything I see from public, I can record.  Anything I see from public, I can record.  I'm on public right now.  So you can't tell me I can't be on the public sidewalk where I am at.  Let's see.  Let's see where I'm at.  This is your property?  You own all this?  then you need to.  you need to prevent the privacy.  you need to put up the polls.  you can't tell me what i can record from public.  all right that's good.  look at that little cry baby.  call metro.  call your daddy.  go call your little daddy because he ain't gonna do nothing but tell you i'm allowed to film from right here and chill.  Yeah, I wouldn't call Metro because that would be funny for you guys to make Turnberry look bad.  I'm here just to record the building, and you're trying to call the cops?  All right, that's what Turnberry does.  Yeah, we are.  So you're a hypocrite.  Why are you harassing me?  I'm not a hypocrite.  I just want to make sure I have your face when I call Metro.  Why are you closer than six feet?  It's all good.  Oh, you're going to call your daddy, and your daddy's going to tell you what's up?  He sure is.  Yeah, he's going to tell you how I'm allowed to record anything I can see from public, and you can't do nothing about it.  Okay.  Learn your lies.  You good.  Okay, good.  So you can step back.  I like the way I look on your camera, though.  I know I look good.  It's the new hero now.  You like that?  So you think that you can't record on public property?  No, I didn't.  I just said you needed permission from Turnberry.  She said that I can't record on public property.  I can record whatever I want.  Nope.  I said you needed permission from Turnberry to record from Turnberry.  I can record whatever I want on this public sidewalk.  You can't tell me what I'm recording.  Did you get that trickle?  I'm waiting on it.  I hope they did.  Daddy's going to tell him what's up, too.  They're going to be like, man, he's allowed to record whatever he wants.  Turnberry place for a trespasser.  There's no trespass.  You can't trespass me off public sidewalk.  So they're trying to trespass me off public sidewalk where she's at right now.  You see the public sidewalk?  They can't trespass that.  They can't trespass you from public sidewalk.  They can't do anything.  I can't even wait until they get here.  I'm on public sidewalk.  You see where I'm at right here.  It's on your camera and on my camera.  I got two different cameras going right now.  Hey, brother.  How's it going today, sir?  How are you?  Good, bro.  Yeah, cool.  So, Officer Brother Metro, the reason that we're here.  What's your badge number, bro?  16291.  We're here because they had an issue.  Did you have an issue with them yet?  No, did you educate them?  You just saw me pull up.  No, no, I'm telling you.  I didn't know if maybe you came around the other side.  No, I just told you what's going on.  She walked up, said, you can't film from here.  And I said, you know, I'm on a public sidewalk.  I can film anything I want in public.  I was just getting shots of buildings.  I did that.  Turnberry.  No traveling.  She goes, you're not allowed unless you get permission from the Turnberry Palace.  I'm like, I've been filming it for 10 minutes.  Turnberry Palace to... Film their property.  I said, I'm allowed to film anything from public.  You have to create the privacy.  I can film anything right here.  You know that, I mean, right?  I mean, I'm in the right.  Are you from out of town just taking some shots?  I don't answer questions, but I'm just taking shots.  I will let you know I'm taking shots.  Okay.  Do you have ID on you?  No.  Can you tell me your name?  No.  So all I need to know?  I'm not going to ID for something because I'm not doing a crime.  I'm not doing anything that you can even accuse me of being a crime.  No, I'm not accusing you.  I'm filming from a public sidewalk right here.  I never even said you were a criminal.  I know.  I'm just saying I'm not going to ID when I don't have to.  That's my given right.  You need to tell me at least a name.  All I got to do is type in a name.  I'm a good citizen.  We'll be good.  Good citizen.  That's not... You don't have to type it in for me because I've never been on their property and there's no call on me.  You're not in trouble.  I know, but it's all... I just want to know what's happening and I just want your name.  So I don't have to give a name.  I refuse to... I'm going to go with Fifth Amendment and just not talk.  I thought you were cool at first.  I am.  All I'm asking is a name.  That's all.  I just wanted to know your name.  No, good citizen right now.  That's my name.  She wouldn't give me her name either, so there's no reason to give names.  You're a public official.  That's the only reason you gave me your name.  What?  The only reason you gave me your name is you're a public official.  No.  She didn't give me her name.  No, it's common courtesy.  That's all.  Yeah, well, I'm a good citizen.  That's all right.  Okay.  I'm not going to hide you.  Okay.  I just wanted them to be educated.  The only reason I hung around, I told her.  It's on film.  I said, she goes, you've been here eight minutes.  I said, I'm filming the bones.  I'm about to leave.  But you throw in the collar cops.  And he said he was going to call the cops.  I don't run from the cops.  I'm going to stay right here because I've had it happen to other places.  Normally a cop comes and educates them, lets them know I can film from the sidewalk, whatever I want.  And as long as I don't touch their property, they can't do anything about it.  Okay.  And then once that's over with, once you educate them, I'm gone.  Because I'm going down to this, you know, down to the next area on the strip in the downtown to film.  That's what I've been doing.  So they wasted 30 minutes of my time, but now you can educate me.  Is there anything else I can help you with?  You're the one that stuck around.  I don't... No, no, I'm just making sure.  I'm not detained, right?  You said I hadn't committed a crime.  You're on the sidewalk.  Yep.  Seems pretty all right.  Not blocking any traffic.  Nothing coming through.  I would have already drove off, but I had to wait for you guys.  Which is all right.  It's nice weather today, finally.  Well, you're in the shade.  Well, I was in the sun.  No, I like the sun.  Can I look at the car while you're here?  Are you not cool with that?  I'm not going to make you uncomfortable.  Well, that is on private property.  You're right.  You're right.  I can't touch it.  No, no, you're right.  You're right.  You got me, bro.  You got me.  I wanted to check out the car.  So I educated you.  You did, which is good.  And I'm good with that.  I feel like you should, you know, pay it back with telling me your name.  I'm never going to do that.  I will not educate you anymore.  Okay.  But on this, man, I'm going to make you probably at this point, you're like a B minus.  You're doing good.  A B?  Come on.  Only because you're pushing the name thing, bro, and I don't have to give it to you because I'm not committing a crime and there's no suspicion of a crime.  And I hope, I mean, that's what he's doing, I hope.  He's educating her, right?  Or educating him.  They're both Karens to me at this point because they wouldn't identify.  Oh, you use that word, Karen?  I don't like that.  You know, I only do it when it's notable, bro.  Not even that.  It's like it's so... I know.  It's pretty bad.  My aunt doesn't like it.  That's her name.  All right.  How long have you been working out here?  Oh, I've been here in Vegas?  Oh, like 10 years.  Oh, and you were before a cop somewhere else?  California maybe or something?  How long have you been here in Vegas?  Oh, you know, I don't answer questions.  Oh, good.  But, you know, I like to talk to you guys and find out what you're doing because you're public officials.  And if you're doing a good job, that's good.  I like to show people that you guys actually do good jobs.  State to state, man.  I like how you approach me, though.  That was very professional.  I have to say, that's probably the most professional I've had in the last 10 approaches.  You name him by his number, bro?  What's up, man?  Officer Magana, P number 16663.  This gentleman doesn't answer questions.  And I just wanted to make sure you had educated them that I'm allowed to film from public sidewalks.  That's the only reason I hung around.  I was filming the buildings, and she said I couldn't.  And she said she was calling the cops.  I tried to, but they were like, we're calling the cops.  I'm like, all right, you can educate.  And I told them they're going to get an education, which is good.  And then she tells me after she called the cops, why didn't you leave yet?  I'm not leaving because she called the cops.  Now, I want to ask you, because I've always wanted to ask about this.  If you have nothing better to do, that's fine.  I just wanted to ask you.  No, I'm leaving.  I'm leaving.  I would never go on their property.  You're going to get trespassed?  All right, thanks.  But I want to ask you one more question.  Can I ask you one more just for education for me?  I don't answer questions, sir.  Oh, that's good, bro.  That's good, bro.  I like that.  That's good. ",
