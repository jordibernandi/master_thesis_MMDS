            "text": "Good morning, church family.  Welcome to The Daily Word.  It is October the 14th, and we're in 1 Timothy chapter 2 now today.  And if you'll open up your copy of God's Word, I would also recommend having a pad or a piece of paper next to you today.  We're going to dig in to some good truths and look at some things.  But first, understand that Paul begins this whole chapter... with an emphasis on prayer and how worship or you could say an assembly or how God's people should be coming together or even viewing certain aspects of church life.  He says, So you have kind of the parts of prayer there.  He wants prayer to be made, thanksgivings to be made on behalf of all men.  That's why we pray for the leaders of our country.  That's why we pray for those in authority.  That's why we want to offer ourselves as good citizens and be tranquil and humble and godly, never laying down truth, but in the same sense, being prayerful and respectful of all leaders, all walks of life.  He says this is good and acceptable in the sight of God, our Savior.  And so the reason to pray that way and to be that way is to lead a godly life, to reflect the image of Christ, to be good and acceptable in our conduct in the sight of God.  He goes on to say who desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.  He explains there's one mediator, that is Christ.  And then Paul goes on with a big therefore in 8, verse 8.  So he wants the men unified.  He wants them operating in holiness.  And now we move into the practical elements of the worship gathering or the way the church is to operate in worship.  And then we'll move into chapter three, which will tell us the qualifications of church leaders in the church, of course.  And so this is the part that gets a little controversial for some people.  Paul says, Here's what that's saying, really.  At that time, women had a real culture of if you got it, flaunt it.  Your wealth, you would show it off.  The way you dress, the way you accessorized, all of it was meant to show, look at me.  They wanted attention on their bodies, their attention on their looks, and it was all about them.  He says, no, that's not how a godly woman operates.  Now, that doesn't mean that you in 2020 don't do your hair or put on makeup to come to church, or you don't put on a nice dress or what have you, ladies.  No, it means, though, that the focus is godliness.  It is not to come to church and try to be a distraction or try to get eyes on you.  Your focus is Christ.  It's a modest and discreet, godly woman.  It's not an if-I-got-it, flaunted attitude like Beyonce or some of these ladies out there in the world or Kim Kardashian or whoever tell you to do it.  And, you know, all that stuff is celebrated in the world.  No, women are to be adorning themselves with a spiritual adorning, something that is godly.  And so that is a clear command from Paul.  But here's the part that gets a little controversial.  Let a woman quietly receive instruction with entire submissiveness.  But I do not allow a woman to teach or exercise authority over a man, but to remain religious.  Quiet, for it was Adam who first was created, then an Eve, and it was not Adam who was deceived, but the woman, being quite deceived, fell into transgression.  But women shall be preserved through the bearing of children if they continue in faith and love and sanctity with self-restraint.  Scholars go a few different ways on that last part, but overall, some land in the sense of women being preserved in the sense that they had original sin, Eve, but now women, they bear children and they get the chance to influence those children and their legacy or their godliness and their high status in the Lord and their purpose in life certainly is seen through their ability to influence the next generation and to raise up godly children.  Some would even argue that women going through the curse of pain in childbirth is actually part of living out the preservation of God in the sense of they're going through what God said they would go through.  And that's the extent of it.  But simply just because Eve transgressed doesn't mean like all women are cursed forever and they can't be redeemed or can't be held in high regard.  So but what I want to zero in on here is.  is his statement about women not being allowed to teach or exercise authority over men in the church, but to remain quiet.  What does all that mean?  Well, I wrote a position paper on this some time ago, and I do want to jot down a few notes with you and direct you to a clear understanding of why women could not be, if you will, a pastor, an elder, or the preacher at the church who's exercising a teaching ministry and authority over the body, which would certainly include men.  The first thing I do want to say is that women are esteemed throughout the New Testament and the Bible as great co-laborers in the faith, equal co-laborers in the faith, who share the gospel with others in many different contexts, that men and women are used by God in powerful ways, and they have been throughout the ages.  And also, though, that only men can function as qualified elders or the qualified authoritative preacher, teacher in the church.  The words that really start the war on this topic is that Paul was saying that the woman could not get up and she could not be the preacher or the teacher, exercising authority over the church.  Some have said, well, his words were only directed at Ephesus because they had kind of a local feministic culture.  Others have argued, well, it was due to the lack of education opportunities for women at the time.  That was just cultural back then.  Others have said he was just referencing women using their authority in a negative way.  And then following that statement, decided to show that they get the influence over children and can be trusted and all of that.  And there's some positions that take strong stances there.  In the end, we have to look at what the context of Paul's words are.  He is giving instruction to shepherd the flock.  and to walk in godliness, and to ensure that there's a framework for the church, and he is very distinct in the roles given to men and women.  The context is the life of the church.  It is how the church is to function.  Certainly, women can still receive great education.  Women could lead in business.  They could lead even now in corporations.  Women do a lot of things that are wonderful and authoritative in the corporate structures of the world, but in the church, Paul, by the direction of the Holy Spirit, is laying groundwork for who is to do the preaching and the teaching.  And I would say we need to be very careful divorcing this from chapter 3.  Remember, when these letters were originally written, there wasn't chapter 1, chapter 2, this verse, that verse.  It was read like a letter.  And so tomorrow... you'll want to get some good understanding as well of the qualifications of the pastor-elder, which is very interesting that Paul puts it right after making distinctions about men and women and roles within the church.  And so it's hardly cultural or distinct from the qualifications for elders there.  Paul references elders in the next chapter again that they would be men only.  And the New Testament teaches male headship in these positions throughout the rest of the books of the Bible or the books in the New Testament.  In 1 Timothy 3, which we'll study, husband of one wife.  In 1 Corinthians 11, 3, Paul says that Christ is the head of every man and man the head of the woman.  In 1 Corinthians 11, verse 2, He says, hold firm to the traditions you've been taught.  And that's regarding church order.  1 Corinthians 11, 16.  This is practiced by the churches.  So it's not like it was just in Ephesus and they had sort of feminists in the church.  This is Corinth.  This is other places.  This is beyond the context just of this letter.  Hebrews 13, 17 says, obey your leaders and submit to them.  And with the picture painted of church leaders and that not including a woman exercising authority over the church, that would clearly still be consistent.  In 2 Timothy 1, verse 5 and in Titus 2, verses 3 through 5, women are consistent.  clearly instructed and encouraged to exercise teaching roles over other women and over children.  So they have a teaching ministry there.  Paul doesn't say instruct the women to teach the men or to teach the whole church or when the women gather and the men gather and the children gather and the woman takes the role of this or that.  No, he's very clear.  There's a specific demographic that women are to teach and exercise authority over.  In Ephesians 5 verse 23, He says the husband is the head of the wife.  So there's more male headship taught in the Bible.  In Ephesians 5.22 and Colossians 3.18, wives are to submit to husbands.  And so there as well in marriage and in the church, we see the picture of headship given.  In Galatians 3.28, we see that all are equal in Christ.  And so none of this negates our equality in the Lord.  It's just roles.  If you liken it to a sports team, not everybody can be the catcher, the pitcher, or the right fielder.  People play different positions.  And so it is in God's order in the church and in the home.  He has a distinct role for men and women to play and to complement one another.  In 1 Peter 3, verse 7, women are said to be the weaker vessel physically and emotionally.  Science and biology have proven that.  Men are to be protectors, providers, initiators, lovers of their wives, seeing them never as less than themselves, but seeing their role as one that can at times be weaker in emotional or physical state.  No woman wrote a New Testament letter.  And no woman ever held the office of pastor or elder in all of Scripture.  Some arguments that people make is that because God used women powerfully throughout the Bible, which no one would deny, you'd be crazy to, that they can be pastors or elders today.  They may say, well, look at Esther.  Look at Ruth.  Look at Hannah.  Look at Deborah.  She was a judge.  And we want to look really clearly at what the Bible says about those things and see none of that meant that they operated as a priest in the priesthood in the Old Testament or even operated as a pastor or an elder in the New Testament.  Some would say, hey, the first woman was a preacher when Jesus rose from the dead and he sent Mary to go and tell his disciples.  That's a big stretch and a logical fallacy or sort of a false idea to say, well, all right, it must be true.  If he sent Mary to be a witness, that was the first woman preacher.  A woman could be a pastor and exercise authority over the whole church.  That's like comparing apples to oranges.  God uses women powerfully to spread his message.  God uses women to be a witness.  That's what that was.  But it wasn't him instituting her and saying, you are now to lead the church and be a pastor and elder.  Esther saved God's people.  God used her mightily.  It wasn't a pastor, an elder, or a priest.  Ruth's loyalty changed history.  She's in the lineage of Christ.  Hannah's faith and courage in 1 Samuel 1 gives birth to her son Samuel, who's a great priest and prophet, if you will, in Israel.  He's the one who anointed David.  Abigail influenced the king in 1 Samuel 25.  Deborah was a judge in Judges chapter 4.  Mary tells everyone about the resurrection in John 20, verse 14.  Priscilla, along with her husband, helped to guide Apollos in Acts 18.  So there's a woman being used mightily to even encourage someone in their teaching and in their accuracy.  Chloe helped Paul in 1 Corinthians 1, verse 11.  Phoebe was highly commended by Paul as a servant in Romans 16.  Philip's daughter actually prophesies in Acts 21.  Isn't that interesting?  Used mightily in that moment, yet not a pastor or an elder.  And women praying and prophesying in the assembly in 1 Corinthians 11, verse 4.  What does all that come to?  Simply this.  God, in his sovereign order, has given positions and roles to men and women.  We are equal in him spiritually.  We are distinct by design.  Men are men, women are women.  We're to complement one another in our roles.  The Bible paints no picture of a woman playing that role.  And so a man should not say, well, I'm the dominant one then.  I'm the big shot or I'm the man.  No, the man simply plays his role just like a pitcher in baseball does his job.  And the right fielder does their job.  Nobody says they're better.  or I can do it without you or I don't need you.  No, we're a body.  And we work together with our distinct and unique designs.  Women have changed the world.  Women have changed history.  Women are godly tools, vessels in the hand of their mighty God.  We should commend them in their ministry.  Hold them in high esteem while at the same time honorably respecting the distinct design for men and women.  Culture does not change that.  Feminism does not change that.  Feelings or emotions does not change that.  Even gifting doesn't change that.  There are some incredible women.  who are going to do and already do incredible things in our church and many other churches.  The simple fact is we're to play our roles as equals in the body, exercising authority where God has instructed us to do.  I hope that helps you.  If you'd like a copy of the position paper I wrote on this, I'd be happy to send it over to you.  There's a lot more and this daily word has gone about 15 minutes.  And so I'd love to challenge you to dig more, but also stick with me tomorrow in chapter three, as we look at the qualifications of pastor elders, and that one of those will certainly be the husband of one wife, not the wife of one husband.  I love you, church.  I hope this encourages you and explains a little more of why, as a team, we've taken the position of what is called complementarianism, men and women in distinct design, men only holding the office of elder, and women still having a very high calling from God as equals in the Lord with their own distinct role.  I love you, church.  We'll see you tomorrow. ",
