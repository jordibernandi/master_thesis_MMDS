She decided that she needed to take an extended break from streaming and social media.  She's really overworked herself, you guys.  She's really... He's seen those streams, I swear to God.  Pokimane is just... I don't know how to put it.  I've never seen such a charismatic entity in my life.  I had to catch my breath, Poki.  You're too funny.  Do you hear that?  It's sexy.  This is what it's like having dinner with Pokimane.  I welcome you all.  This is great content.  Oh my god.  It's no wonder she's burnt out.  She keeps making stuff like this.  It's so energy draining.  Pokey occasionally eats and interacts with chat.  Oh my god, the show is fantastic.  I see why Twitch got rid of Dr.  Disrespect.  They needed more money to hold on to Pokey.  It was only a matter of time before she took over Ellen DeGeneres' show.  You know, a show where the woman who's the host turns out to be quite fake and a really mean person behind the scenes.  Pokey main published a tweet yesterday while I was asleep apparently.  Revealing that she'd be taking a month-long break from streaming after quarantine and overwork, having burned her out?  Dude, Pokimane has a team of people that make that content.  I'm not joking.  She pays a group of people to make her videos and stuff and moderate her... ",

And you wouldn't even know that there were people behind the scenes working on that stuff.  Mind blown!  Anyway, she's willing to begrudge my ass a few pittance.  And meanwhile, she spends more a month than I've ever gotten.  Good lord.  Like, that's her petty cash.  And still, the content is, like, subpar.  My god.  Dude, check out my paint channel.  I'm dead ass.  Like, there's a video of, like, me painting on my channel.  Look at it.  Look it up.  It says sometimes I paint giant robots or whatever.  Look at the production value of that video and then compare it to anything Pokimane has done.  It will amaze you that that video was made between two dudes.  Me and Stu 2.0.  Dude, I don't even, dude.  I can't.  She's like, I'm so stressed out from content creation.  She literally gets to chill out and react to stuff and people love her.  Pokimane even came out once and she was like, oh you guys, I like streamed and I didn't even have the camera on and I still maintain a lot of people while playing Valorant.  Did you see that? ",

Thirsty dudes will hang in there through thick and thin until it is abundantly clear they'll never get somewhere with a chick.  I've known guys who have literally waited years to hook up with a chick.  Waited years.  And the girl wasn't even that great.  A single mother that rolled the carousel to new levels.  And this dude's hanging in there like, one day she gonna see me, dude.  And it's like, you out your damn mind.  It's like you're fighting for a used car, but that has nothing to do with Pok\u00e9Doll.  I'm just saying, the guys who are into Pok\u00e9 aren't leaving.  They know, they stick around, the camera will be back on at some point.  And they're still holding onto the idea she's single.  By the way, I said she wasn't, like, two, three months ago?  Leafy says it, the internet blows up!  Just exposed Poki on Twitter.  having a boyfriend.  It's blowing up like the godfather.  Let's see.  However, the streamer has been a subject of contention lately after angry fans expressed dismay that she was keeping her relationship under wraps.  There doesn't seem to be any reason as to why she's taking a step back from the camera.  Now that's because she got hyper exposed.  And instead of you know, apologizing, which is the move she could have made.  And like I said before, the only reason why she apologized to Blow Blacks, Blow Blocks, sorry, dude, I cannot get that damn name right, bro.  The only reason why she apologized to him, and even he knows it, he said it to me privately, I'm pretty sure, is because PewDiePie stepped in and said something.  Had PewDiePie came in and said, Pokey, it wasn't cool what you did to Gundam, then she would have came out and said, hey, you guys, I was just, you know, a little angry, and I'm sorry, and subscribed to PewDiePie, and everybody would have forgotten.  On the 5th, I may explain she'll be taking a month-long break from posting, social media streaming, and keeping a constant schedule for almost six years on the platform.  God, I wish I could do what Pokimane does.  I'm deadass.  I wish I could.  I wish I could just sit and watch and people just throw money at me. ",

Let's see, the quarantine and the shutdown... of conventions is her way of seeing her fans, which are joys and motivations for making content.  Yeah, that's scary great content.  Am I fucking right?  You know, like Lord have mercy.  And I'm saying it out of jealousy.  I wish you guys would pay me hundreds of dollars to watch me eat sushi.  You lazy pay pigs.  Why won't you pay me to exist?  ah okay let me read this goddamn tweet so i can get the hell out of here.  youtube says daddy gundam only has to be here for eight minutes and i'll be damned if i stay a minute longer.  stew Jesus Christ, call me Carson.  My God, dude.  Is he, like, going for, like, is he running for mayor of nothing?  Like, he wants to be liked by everyone.  Pokimane comes out, totally tries to sh** me, dude.  I lost a sponsor, bro.  Carson didn't come in and go, Poki, that's a bad look.  Carson would have been like, you know what, Poki, he had it coming.  That's probably my lawyer.  AFK dot.  You know, someone else made this font and everything for her.  Wonder how much that costs.  Since quarantine began, it has been hard for me to find the same joys and motivation for making content.  Oh, what about the rest of us?  What do you think I'm doing right now?  Dude, I made content when my dog died.  Not Fluffy.  Fluffy's alive.  Forgive me.  When Choochie died, I kept making videos because I knew people liked them.  When my guitar teacher died who was like a father to me, I kept making videos.  Pokey refuses to say sorry.  Leafy nukes her.  All of a sudden, it's break time.  I'm just angry because she's probably going to have an amazing break.  You know she's going to be sitting in a mansion.  Probably be on some private beach somewhere with her boyfriend, counting the money Simpsons is sending in.  I hope you come back soon, Poki!  Tier 3 sub for life!  Do the ultimate!  Do the ultimate!  Wiggle wiggle!  Look at those feet!  I can see her toes!  The things I look forward to the most... Like, visiting my family, traveling, going to conventions, and meeting some of you aren't possible right now.  She must have a nice family, because visiting my family is f***ing bad, man.  I see my family, Uncle Joe pop out like, I'll piss on you, motherf***er.  I asked too much information.  Pokey's family's all hugs.  My family, someone's pulling a knife on someone else at the dinner table.  Whatever.  I'm sorry.  You don't need to know my life.  I'm sorry.  You're here for entertainment.  You're not here to be my therapist.  He would piss on you, though.  For those of you like, did he piss on you?  Like, this motherfucker piss on anybody.  Joe did not give a fuck.  He looked like Bubbles from Trailer Park Boys.  He had the same glasses, everything, but he's bald.  All right, anyway.  Let's see, look forward to going to conventions.  Of course she likes conventions.  She gets like a star panel and everybody treats her like God.  I go to a convention and they're like, excuse me sir, you don't have a pass to go over here.  I'm the talent.  And they're like, get out of here, idiot.  This has led me to feeling burnt out for quite some time and because of that I've been planning to take a month off.  I recognize that I'm very lucky to work during the pandemic.  However, I still need to do what's best for my mental health.  I haven't taken a month off since I graduated from high school over six years ago.  And I feel it's long overdue for some time.  Anyway, my career and online experience.  She's already a millionaire, so it doesn't matter.  Let's see.  I haven't had a vacation in 13 years.  Boo hoo, pokey.  Let me cry you a river.  I want to be happy and excited to make content for you all.  And I'm looking forward to getting back into that headspace.  Until then, I hope you use this message as a reminder to take care of yourselves.  Disconnect from social media and go outside.  Pick up a new hobby and hang in there.  You've got this.  See you soon.  And that isn't a fake issue.  I can understand if Pokimane was doing the content herself.  If Pokimane was editing 8 to 12 hours a day.  You know, but she's not.  She's a team of people working for her.  I understand burnout when she's like a one man army, which is what I'm living.  Sometimes I get help and thank God for everyone that's ever helped me along the way.  You know who you are.  And I understand some of you that have helped me have decided to distance yourself because I am a lightning rod right now.  I understand.  And I hope things work out for you.  I love you.  You're amazing.  God bless you.  You magnificent bastard.  Burn out when you have a team of people editing your content and doing the stuff for you.  I feel almost bad for gross gore.  He's so desperate for some attention, he's doing this shit on Pokey's timeline.  I felt so bad for Growscore.  We're taking a 180 right now on Growscore.  Forget Pokey.  There's one point where Growscore put out a video where he's crying about his woman leaving him.  And the chick's new guy would come to his house and leave flowers and shit for Growscore.  If that was real, that has to be the most emasculated shit ever.  Growscore should be the most fucking taking a break.  You're not Pokey.  Despite all the drama, Poki's still kind of killing it.  She signed to Adidas.  She signed to Twitch.  She signed to Cloak, the most overpriced clothing brand I've ever seen for gamers.  Nothing says gamer like a $90 t-shirt.  move on.  And frankly, I should end with this.  Thank you, Pokimane, for being a Karen.  That day you decided to try and ruin me.  You made me bigger than I ever was before.  You effectively... Hold me out of YouTube's blacklist, but I'm kind of sinking back in.  And for that, I'm grateful.  Had you spoken to me personally and were nice or treated me like I existed more than just some VR troll that was beneath your notice, everything probably would have gone so differently for you.  But thankfully, your level of hubris and megalomania led you down the path you're on.  Thank you.  You have a special place in my heart, even though you continuously ban anyone that subs me to you on Twitch.  But now that Pokey's on break, we can make me a tier.  three sub, boys.  Oh, big ups, Diesel Patches.  I'd like to thank Raycon for sponsoring your boy, Gundam.  The everyday E25 earbuds are their best model yet, with six hours of playtime, seamless Bluetooth pairing, more bass, and more compact design that gives you nice noise isolation fit.  It also comes in a few colors, just in case black doesn't do it for you.  I've been using them for the past few weeks now.  They fit inside my motorcycle helmet with ease and they're great while airbrushing due to the noise isolation.  Hell, I forgot they were even on my ears on some occasion.  The Raycon earbuds are half the price of other premium wireless earbuds on the market.  Dude, the carrying case?  I thought it didn't do anything!  This thing actually charged the earbuds four times on a single charge!  I just thought it was for looks!  Anyway, use the link in the description to save 15% off of your order.  And that's buyraycon.com.  slash Gundam. ",
