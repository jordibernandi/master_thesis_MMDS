The Sivaggio political establishment continues to hike up taxes and government revenue schemes to fund a bloated police department.  It's approximately doubled in size under Savageo, and with the addition of the fired bad cops from San Antonio, it just keeps on growing.  To make sure his favorite police officers have huge salaries, they utilize a special sales tax.  By the way, Savageo does pick favorites, and he's been counseled on that before. ",

And what I wanted to discuss, and if anyone has information about what I'm going to bring up, I would certainly appreciate answers to the questions I have.  But my understanding is that the budget for this used to be $340,000 a year, which funded the salaries for four police personnel.  And that was in 2018.  And now in the 2020 budget, it's gone up to $360,000.  And at that, bringing the fund balance down from 150,000 to 50,000.  So not only a huge deficit, but with that 360,000, it's now only funding three personnel.  So it's gone up in expenditures with the revenues shrinking.  And even at that, I think that's a very I think the revenue estimation with the crisis and everything is quite positive.  I think it might not actually raise that much money in the next budget year.  So it's going from $150,000 to $50,000 at that, but only for three personnel where it used to fund four personnel.  In the PowerPoint we're about to see, I think it's saying that this is to have the big city... police resources that small towns might have to other small towns that don't have this, not have patrol officers and assistant police chiefs, is none of the expenditures with this police fund seem to be anything special that needs a special sales tax.  To me, it seems like the preferred city staffers continue to get more and more and more and more and more money on the backs of citizens.  And I guess maybe if there's a new city administration, you're not going to have much money to work with.  But maybe that's okay because the new city council could just get rid of the sales tax and help everyone out a little bit.  So my question is, what in this is so special that is really needed to me?  It just seems like it's preferred police salaries and a lot of money that just isn't there.  Thank you, board. ",

            "text": "So the Crime Control and Prevention District is a special persons district that was created for the purpose of improving the crime prevention and reducing crimes.  In 1989, a Texas legislator recognized that some of these smaller cities that were encompassed by these larger cities had the same type of problems that the larger cities have that don't have the resources to deal with them.  The legislature passed this Crime Control and Prevention District Act to enable the cities to create this district to collect sales tax to dedicate to the crime control and reductions.  On November 5, 2013, Leon Valley voted to create this district, which was a 1.8% sales tax.  And on November 6, 2018, the citizens voted again overwhelmingly to continue the district.  So the citizens of Leon Valley fully support this type of program and have for the last seven years.  So proposed for fiscal year 2021 budget is an operating expenditures of $368,071.  The vast majority of that is for the salaries, but we do have other things that are not listed up there that are included in that as far as some contracts and some additional overtime and things like that.  And operating revenues that we currently have is $273,100.  You can see the budget from fiscal year 18-19 through now as you see the numbers trended downward as far as your beginning fund balance.  We always show a much more less budget at the end of the year just like we do at $53,000 and like we normally do we end up with something considerably more and we expect that again this year.  Our differences this year we reduced was about a 10%.  because we don't know what COVID is going to bring, especially since this is a standalone sales tax and has to specifically be for the specific purposes it was created for.  The finance department decided that we would do the best we can and show a 10%, and then we can pray and hope that it's going to be much better than that in the future.  So you can see our expenditures and our total expenditures.  And so at the end of the next year, if we spend everything that we plan on spending, which we never do, then we will still have a balance in there of $53,773 and probably much more than that.
