            "text": "This is the Dollamore Daily, and I'm Jesse Dollamore.  When you have a scammer and a grifter and a scumbag as President of the United States, naturally you're going to have a flock of vultures who are also grifters who encircle that President.  And that is what we've experienced over the course of the last almost four years with Donald Trump.  He is no longer allowed by law to be on the board of a charity.  Let's put this in perspective.  The president of the United States of America, it is against the law for him to be on the board of a charity in the state of New York because he scammed and was fraudulent with his charitable foundation.  None of his kids can either.  He defrauded students, people who paid tuition to learn about the real estate trade, with Trump University.  He's a liar and he's a grifter.  And those around him are as well.  Enter Mike Lindell.  You've probably seen him.  He goes by the MyPillowGuy.  That'll be the last time that I refer to him as my pillow guy, because I'm not going to advertise for his trashy crap pillows.  Mike Lindell likes to put himself out there as an inventor.  An inventor.  It's a pillow, dude.  You didn't invent the pillow, and you most certainly did not invent a better pillow.  You will also notice that he always has the cross hanging outside of his shirt, also advertising his faith.  Not to proselytize, but to let you know he's a Jesus guy.  So maybe you'll think he's honest.  He is not.  Yeah, so this man, this Christian man, is a big supporter of Donald Trump.  Big supporter.  So big that I get emails like this one from him via the campaign saying that everybody loves Donald Trump.  Some just don't know it yet.  This great Christian man who's always advertising his faith apparently doesn't care about encaging children.  Denying healthcare to the sick and the poor.  Turning off food stamp benefits to hungry American children.  None of that really bothers him.  Racism doesn't really bother Mike Lindell because he thinks Donald Trump is the greatest president in the history of the United States.  Anyway, I'm gonna play a very brief segment from this interview because, well, first of all, let's talk about why he's in the news.  He is on the board of a company that is hawking a coronavirus cure.  He says in the interview, in later parts of it, that he cannot transmit nor contract the coronavirus because he's on this supplement, this unproven supplement.  Again, I encourage you to watch all of the interview.  It's almost 20 minutes long, but I'm going to play about two minutes of it just to give you a flavor.  And then we're going to talk about Mike Lindell and this lie that he is that he's propagating that there's another cure, not just hydroxychloroquine, but this new thing that actually comes from a toxic plant that could kill you.

            "text": "All right, well, first of all, misconstrued is a verb, Mike Lindell.  To misconstrue the definition to interpret something, especially a person's words or actions, wrongly.  It's not an adjective like dumb or wrong, Mike Lindell.  Let's talk a little bit about Mike Lindell and this particular drug.  The Washington Post back in August wrote an article, published an article entitled The Lost Days of Summer, How Trump Fell Short in Containing the Virus.  I'm going to read a couple paragraphs from that.  The president recently hosted Andrew Whitney, a biopharmaceuticals executive on the board of a company called Phoenix.  who met in the Oval Office with Trump.  Whitney, who has a limited health background, pitched Trump on a botanical extract called oleandrin as a treatment for the coronavirus, according to two senior administration officials with knowledge of the discussion.  One official said Mike Lindell, a Trump booster and chief executive of MyPillow, who stars as pitchman for his product and advertising on some of the Fox News show's Trump watches, helped arrange the meeting.  Since then, Whitney has personally made overtures to senior leaders at the Food and Drug Administration, including its commissioner, Stephen Hahn, in an effort to get the agency to approve oleandrine as a treatment for coronavirus.  The agency, the Food and Drug Administration, which declined to comment, has not made any sort of approval.  Whitney and Lindell did not respond to requests for comment.  So this is a grifter who is now in the orbit of Donald Trump trying to get his company that he's on the board of to profit.  by trying to get another dangerous remedy, snake oil remedy, approved in the treatment of coronavirus.  This particular study is not a study, first of all.  It's like an 18-page paper, only like eight pages of which are actual data, is from the company.  It's not credible.  I'm gonna read from Market Watch.  While a July study out of Texas showed that in test tubes, oleandrin could inhibit the coronavirus in monkey kidney cells, this study has not been peer-reviewed or published yet.  And there are no published reports that oleandrin has been tested to treat COVID-19 in animals or human hosts.  In fact, the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases also conducted some preliminary testing of oleandrin against SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus causing the disease, COVID-19, recently.  It stopped because the results were inconclusive.  The Army stopped because of inconclusive results.  So some of the study details.  Two things are very alarming.  One, the length of this thing.  This is not what a biomedical study looks like.  This is 18 pages in a PDF, eight of which actually contain study details.  The rest of it's filled with an abstract and an introduction, and then this reference list.  that's many, many pages long.  But look at this in the header.  Version posted July 15, 2020.  The copyright holder for this preprint, which was not certified by peer review, is the author slash funder.  So the people who fund and author the study are the same.  That's motivated reasoning, folks.  And not peer reviewed, which means they haven't submitted this for other people who are not financially interested in to review their data and see if they come up with the same results.  They haven't done that yet.  And then also on page nine, competing interests.  RAN is a chief science officer of Phoenix Biotechnology Incorporated, and KJS is a paid consultant with Phoenix Biotechnology Incorporated.  Again, Thick as thieves in here.  This is the company putting out a study of its own results in an effort to get people to think that this is.  Come on.  Come on.  But we shouldn't be surprised that Mike Lindell is involved in this because Mike Lindell is a liar and a scammer.  And some would say many people are saying a criminal.  Mike Lindell, back in 2016, had to pay a settlement, a $1 million settlement for bogus claims.  He was claiming that his pillow cures things like multiple sclerosis and fibromyalgia.  From a Market Watch article, I'm sorry, from a Consumer Reports article, Mike Lindell, CEO of MyPillow, once said that, quote, people are tired of phony advertising.  But the company found itself being accused of misleading advertising in a civil lawsuit brought earlier this year by several California consumer protection groups.  MyPillow agreed to settle the case this week and pay almost $1 million in civil penalties.  Late night infomercials and other ads claimed that the company's pillows could cure not only insomnia, but also such ailments as sleep apnea, fibromyalgia, and even multiple sclerosis.  In August, New York's Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, he's no longer the Attorney General, this was back in 2016.  In August, New York's Attorney General Eric Schneiderman announced a $1.1 million settlement that resolved a whistleblower case against MyPillow that alleged that MyPillow knowingly failed to collect and remit sales tax on purchases made by New Yorkers over the phone or internet.  Sounds like a straight up good Christian man scamming governments out of, you know, what's the scripture?  Render unto Caesar what is Caesar, render unto God what is God's.  Apparently he doesn't believe that part of the Bible because he's trying to scam the state of New York out of over half a million dollars in sales tax.  And then in 2017, his A rating for his company was dropped to an F rating by the Better Business Bureau, again, because of dubious advertising practices.  So why?  Why would we think anything different about Mike Lindell?  Why would this be a case where he's not lying?  Anderson Cooper was right to take him to task.  In fact, Anderson Cooper took him to task at the very end of the interview about as perfectly as he could in the greatest summation in maybe any CNN interview that's ever aired.  Watch this. ",
