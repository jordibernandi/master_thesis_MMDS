            "text": "it went like this i auditioned to be and take that we worked our bollocks off like you would not believe it like you would not believe what we and we had the energy and the ability to do it because we were really young.  we started with a school in the morning school in the afternoon uh performing um youth club under 18s club over 18s club two gay clubs and a straight club day after day after day after day after day, building up this reputation.  We had these cards that we used to throw into the audience with the PO box on the back where they could get information about us.  But basically what those cards were, were information data.  Because once we had your information, this was then worth something.  And this is basically what happened.  No record company wanted to sign us at all.  Boy bands were dead.  But we amassed 70,000 of these cards with people's information on it.  The record company that signed us, BMG, bought the cards, bought the information, bought the data that we came with.  That was what was worth money to them, not us, our image, or our songs.  And then we and them exploited that and we Got lucky.  Had a hit with Only Takes a Minute Girl.  And the phenomena grew, you know.  I left.  I wrote and recorded a bunch of songs.  I released four of them.  And with lesser degrees of success.  And a note went around the record company.  We're about to drop Robbie Williams.  That week, Angels came out.  And angels changed absolutely everything for me.  Now, when I went on stage and performed these songs, people like what I did.  Not everybody.  Lots of people fucking hate what I do.  I totally get it.  I'm just saying the people that came to those shows liked what they experienced, told people about it, brought somebody with them.  And that audience grew and grew and grew.  Off my sweat, off my back, with this throat, with this mind, with these jazz hands.  I fucking did that.  Now, if you think in 96 that I went and had a clandestine meeting with somebody and they made it possible for me to become an international pop star, your intuition and the way the prison that you view the world is off.  Now I can only give you that information.  You can lead a horse to, you can lead a horse to culture, but you can't make them think, you know, you can lead a horse to water, et cetera.  Now, also, if you can't, ascertain real soul and real authenticity and real truth when you're being presented with it then you're fucked.  you know i don't know where that came from.  that uh it's just something that because i've been reading the comment section last last few days it's just like also you can't see these people you can't see their lives you can't see who they are.  so the flatness of text you can't get much of a read on.  these people might be dreadfully unhappy.  These people might be suffering with some sort of mental illness.  These people might be all of those things combined.  But when it goes into my computer as a human, it has very detrimental effects, very detrimental effects.  And I need, this is something that I've come up with myself, I need to sort this out because there's undue pain happening caused by the words of strangers.  It has a very powerful effect and hold on my life.  And I don't know why, but I know that I need to release that to live a happier life.  I seem to be addicted to finding people that will tell me what a cunt i am. ",
