It just really upsets me for these people coming on here and talking about our president.  This is the best president that's ever been in this country.  He has done everything for the people of this country, and they have followed him from day one.  Anybody that would stand up there and vote to kill these innocent babies, they've got to be something wrong with them.  There's no such thing as a Democrat party anymore.  They've all turned liberal.

I want to harken back to your statement about Georgia and about the Trump voter.  And they should be very afraid, very afraid.  Trump and you are all we have left, Rush.  We've spent our lives voting for these people because they're not them.  And we just can't do it anymore.  We're tired of being stabbed in the back, Rush.  It's better to have an enemy that's in front of you than a friend that's behind you that's just going to stab you.  They do it every time.  We have a Republican controlled state and they won't do an audit of the vote.  They won't.  They just basically told every Georgian that they don't care.  We were in Washington on Saturday.  Me and my 33-year-old son, we saw more people than we've ever seen in our lifetime ever.  And we're season ticket holders for the Ravens, for God's sakes.  I've been in crowds of 80,000 people.  I've been to Steelers games, for goodness sakes.  I have never seen so many people.  But were there any Republicans there?  No.  None.  None.  Our party leadership, quote, unquote, If this were a Democrat rally, they would all be there.  They were there for the anti-key party movement walking hand in hand up the steps.  No one stands for us, Rush.  Only you and Donald Trump.  God forbid, what do we have left?  I love my president.  I am not a revolutionary, Rush, but I will die for my president.  This man has given more to this country than anybody and he has no need to.  None.  He's a billionaire.  He doesn't need this.  That's exactly right.  It's disheartening. ",
