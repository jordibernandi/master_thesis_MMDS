            "text": "This is Richard Wolff with another Wolff Responds.  This topic is called looting.  What is looting?  And who are looters?  And who is looting whom?  For what?  Let's begin with where you want to begin.  When you throw 40 million people out of work in nine weeks, you are looting lives.  You are depriving people of the most precious things they have.  Their security, their jobs, their incomes, their mental and physical health, their savings, if they have any.  You're taking it all.  and you're taking it when?  At a time when we are all threatened by a serious virus.  You must be kidding if you're thinking about looting not in terms of what is being suffered by 40 million people suddenly and for no reason.  Let me remind those of you who may not know The unemployment that has gone crazy in the United States, they don't have that in Germany.  They don't have that in France.  They don't have that in many European countries because there the bailouts governments gave to businesses had a condition attached to it.  You can't fire anybody.  You can't let them go.  We'll help you pay the wages, but you cannot impose unemployment on millions of people because that is looting their lives.  Compared to that, taking a television from a broken window in a storefront is nothing.  It's tiny.  for the President of the United States to get the sequence wrong, to suggest that shooting is the consequence of looting, rather than understand that in the effects of the huge looting being done of the American people now, it is the shooting by police, usually of innocent people, that sets off the riots and that sets off the trivial looting from which The president ought to attend to the huge looting for which he bears major responsibility, but of course he won't.  He cannot.  He's shown us that over and over again.  But the big looting doesn't stop with the 40 million who are unemployed.  The big looting includes the 120 million who are still employed.  That's right, their lives are being looted too, but it is happening in a bit more of slow motion.  Here's how that works.  If you have 40 million unemployed, especially under the conditions we have today, here's the truth.  Many of the jobs that those unemployed people once had will not be available to them when they're ready to go back to work, whenever that is.  That's because those businesses have been destroyed.  They can't survive weeks, months of not functioning, not earning money, being unable to pay their rent, and even if their landlord doesn't throw them out, and many will, They will collapse and those jobs will not be there.  Unemployment will be very high in the United States for quite a while.  And why is that looting the mass of working people?  Because in a capitalist system, if there are millions of people unemployed, the employers always, I'm going to underline it, always take advantage of that situation.  Here's how they do that.  They let the people who still have jobs know that because of the pandemic and the virus and the lockdowns and you know all of that, I'm going to have to cut your salary by 10%, 20%, 30%.  I'm going to have to cut your benefits.  I'm going to have to ask you to come to work a half an hour earlier for no extra pay.  I'm going to have to cut your lunch hour.  I'm going to have to fill in the blank.  Why is the employer going to do that?  Because he is hurting from this pandemic, and in capitalism, the employer can pass the hurt on to the employee by cutting the wages, cutting the benefits, extending the hours, all the rest.  Why?  Because the employer knows, as you do, That if you quit because you don't like the way you're treated, there are every day more desperate members of the unemployed who will grab the chance to take the job you had at the new worse pay, new fewer benefits, and all the rest.  So you have to basically take it.  and the employers know it.  They're already planning on it.  That's how they're going to recoup some of what they lost over the last nine weeks of this pandemic.  That's how capitalism works.  The problems you have are not about a virus, but it's about an economic system that failed to prepare for it, failed to manage it, achieved the stunning addition of a capitalism crash on top of a terrible virus, and now lets the capitalist system work its magic, shifting the burden of these twin failures off of the employer class and on to the employee class.  You too, those of you who haven't lost your jobs yet, are being looted.  And you ought to think hard and long about a system.  that forces me to ask the question, who is looting whom in the current situation?  What's portrayed in the mass media or what I've just tried to explain?  This is Richard Wolff for Democracy at Work with another Wolff Responds. ",
