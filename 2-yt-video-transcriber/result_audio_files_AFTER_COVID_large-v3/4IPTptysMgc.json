We're in the epicenter of the pandemic, as we turn now to, though, an incredible story unfolding in Venezuela, where President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro announced Monday the government had detained two former U.S.  Special Forces soldiers who took part in a failed coup attempt against him after 10 armed men landed in a boat near Caracas on Sunday.  Venezuelan authorities killed eight of the men, whom they described as mercenary terrorists.  Two men were captured.  Speaking from his presidential palace, President Maduro showed U.S.  passports for the two men, identified as Aaron Berry and Luke Denman.  A former Green Beret named Jordan Goudreau has acknowledged the men were working with him and says they attempted to detain Maduro.  Maduro accused the U.S.  of being behind the plot. ",

Goudreau's plan to oust Maduro reportedly began when he provided security at a concert organized by British billionaire Richard Branson in support of Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido.  The Associated Press reports Goudreau had a connection to Trump's longtime bodyguard, Keith Schiller, and Goudreau reportedly accompanied Schiller to a meeting with Guaido's representatives last May in Miami.  President Trump has denied any involvement, any U.S.  involvement.

At the same time, it looks like a real bad ramble movie or a really bad Venezuelan telenovela.  The reality is that this involved disgruntled Venezuelan military, former police, deserters, political opponents of the Maduro government.  and was training in Colombia, and somehow thought that by landing two boats, one in Macuto, right next to the major airport and port, and the other one in Chihuahua, in the state of Aragua, that they would somehow manage to get to Caracas and capture Maduro and install a new government.  It is almost fictional.  Unfortunately, it's operating in a very charged environment, one in which the U.S.  is seeking regime change.  and one in which the opposition has adopted, in fact, support for military action, as it did in 2019, with the support for a coup against Maduro.  So, it's operating in very troubled waters, and the consequences for Venezuela could be very dire going forward. ",

Goudreau actually presented the contract to Patricia Poleo, an opposition broadcaster in Florida, and she posted it and reported it on her website and invited Guaid\u00f3 and JJ Rend\u00f3n, the person in charge of Maduro's publicity and campaign, and other individuals to come forward and deny it.  None have come forward to deny it.  So, this plot could long-term implicate not only the U.S.  government, also the opposition in Venezuela, Guaid\u00f3 and others, it also allows them plausible deniability.  I mean, what they want from this is to say, if it succeeded, we would take credit for it, they would be part of this transition government.  And if it failed, well, we were not a part of it.  We have plausible deniability, the same way that Trump has plausible deniability, or at least tries to claim plausible deniability.  But I insist, It's the context in which Pompeo, Elliott Abrams, and the Trump White House have created during the pandemic, seeking regime change, imposing further sanctions, tightening those sanctions, and authorizing movement of U.S.  military to the Caribbean and others.  It sets the context in the landscape for which this event happens. ",

Plus, Goudreau, when he tweeted, included real Donald Trump in his tweets about the activities happening in Venezuela.  So, again, what the U.S.  would like is plausible deniability.  We may find out later on that, yes, they knew about it, turned a blind eye to it.  see if it would actually be successful, and eventually then take advantage of it if it did.  But again, I insist it's the context in which it operates that is the most fundamental, because it creates the conditions for attempted, violent, unconstitutional regime change in Venezuela, when in fact what Venezuela needs ",

In 1806, Francisco Miranda attempted an invasion of Venezuela through La Vela de Coro in the peninsula of Paraguan\u00e1, and did not have any support from the Afro population in the region.  In fact, they rebelled against him.  So, there are shades of many things here, which is all very troubling to Venezuela, because, again, Goudreau appeals delusional.  He seems to be an Eric Prince, Blackwater wannabe.  He provided security for a concert that was held on February 23rd by Branson on the C\u00facuta border with Venezuela.  So, he's injected himself into opposition politics, into what was happening with Guaid\u00f3 at the border.  So, again, it's a very, very dangerous figure.  Although he may have this delusional sense of himself and grandeur, he can play in that role because of U.S.  policy. ",
