You are the most active and effective group defending rights in the entire world.  Thank you.  Just last week, look at how many showed up at multiple locations in less than two hours time frame.  We are clearly and peacefully sending the message that we will not tolerate people's rights being infringed upon.  In central Idaho, a man kept his restaurant open to sit down and eat.  A sheriff deputy came in his restaurant and threatened to shut him down.  The restaurant owner informed his friends and they bombarded the sheriff's department with calls and visits, telling the sheriff that he or his deputies will not shut down or find the restaurant.  A few days later, the sheriff apologized to the restaurant owner and ordered his deputies to leave him alone.  This is the way rights are protected.  It has been clearly determined that the legislature has the power to terminate the order from the governor.  Being drunk on power, Governor Little will never do it himself. ",

If they do not, then we will know that we cannot trust them to protect people's rights.  We will be meeting this Thursday, 8  p.m.,  at the warehouse.
