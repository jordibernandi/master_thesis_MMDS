            "text": "Albert Einstein, the famous theoretical physicist who revolutionized his field and whose name has become synonymous with genius, was a socialist.  And I'm not talking about some naive social democrat who thinks government social programs equals socialism.  I am talking about a legit, unabashed socialist who advocated the complete democratic control of the economy, public ownership and control.  In 1949, Einstein wrote an essay for the Marxist publication Monthly Review titled Why  Socialism?,  in which he laid out a critique of capitalism and expressed the need for socialism.  Here, we're going to run through his main arguments.  The economic anarchy of capitalist society as it exists today is, in my opinion, the real source of evil.  That is a damning condemnation from Einstein, but what the hell is he talking about, economic anarchy?  Within capitalist societies, the means of production, the stuff that produces stuff like tools, land, natural resources, energy, etc.  are privately owned and controlled.  Products are produced for a market to make a profit.  These capitalists and their production are blind.  They have no idea how much of a particular product will be on the market, how much of their product will be needed, what kinds of other products will be available on the market that might affect the demand for their product, and at what quantities they'll be available, if they'll even be able to make up for their costs of production, and so on.  Production is carried out based on a lot of educated guessing, but guessing nonetheless.  There's no plan to this society's production.  In the essay, Einstein details three of his primary frustrations with this mode of production.  This production breeds an incredible level of waste, concentrates power in the hands of unaccountable individuals, and undermines both our social needs and our individual needs as human beings.  This anarchy of production is senselessly wasteful in a number of ways.  Einstein points to what's known as the reserve army of labor.  There exists those able to work and willing to work, but through no fault of their own are unemployed or underemployed.  Competition between labor is necessary to capitalist production to keep wages down and to ensure profitability.  the productive power of this labor reserve goes to waste.  similarly during economic crises brought on by the chaos of capital's production itself and her mad dash for profit all the factors of production tools, labor, land, etc.  are fully intact but go to waste because capitalists refuse to allow production without foreseeable profit.  We can also look at how this blind economy wastes resources on sectors of the economy that are only necessary because of the irrationality of capitalist production.  Unsure whether or not there will even be a demand for their products, let alone sufficient demand, capitalists are forced to spend lavishly on advertising to artificially pump up demand.  equally unnecessary and embarrassingly wasteful is the staggering amount of resources dedicated to the sole defense of private property both domestic and abroad.  It'd be careless not to mention capitalism and its destructive relationship with the environment.  I won't get too deep into all of it, but the constant pressure to yield larger and larger profit margins means cutting costs where you can, and one of the ways to do this is to externalize costs.  Sure, a capitalist could invest in the necessary infrastructure needed to handle waste properly, but why do that when you have the opportunity to cut costs and let others deal with the fallout?  So the anarchy of production is wasteful in this literal sense as well.  In the anarchy of capitalist production, Einstein identifies the tendency of capital to continuously concentrate in fewer hands.  And what this means is that an increasingly smaller number of individuals, unelected and unaccountable, win private ownership over the economy.  Einstein highlights that our political democracies are incapable of checking this private economic power.  This private economic power is used to beat and bend our political institutions to their will, and cater to their interests.  You have no democracy under capitalism.  I've made a video detailing this very point if you want to learn more about it.  Einstein also expresses his frustration with the private ownership and control over the news media, which denies many in society an informed view of the world.  These private, unelected, unaccountable individuals are free to frame and distort reality how they see fit.  Their job is not to inform you, but to turn a profit.  I've got a video on this exact topic that you can check out.  Einstein also links the anarchy of production to the undermining of both our needs as individuals and our needs as social beings.  Any sober analysis of the human condition will find that the individual is inescapably dependent on society for their existence.  It's not the single individual farming all their food, sewing all their clothes, teaching themselves speech, assembling their own tools, etc.  It's society.  the billions present and the billions past who give the individual their existence.  Now within our current society, our whole economy consists of enemy combatants constantly vying to deprive one another of the fruits of their labor and of the means of production.  So owners will do everything they can to deprive competing capitalists of their property and appropriate it for themselves.  Those rendered propertyless, faced with the choice of working or wasting away, have the wealth they generate appropriated by their owner.  their existence reduced to that of a wage slave.  In this ruthlessly cutthroat society, the human being experiences their dependence on society, not as a positive relationship, but as a deeply draining and combative one.  Even the capitalists themselves, whose property and position in society are never secure, experience their dependence on society as a negative experience.  Everyone is consumed by feelings of insecurity, isolation, and agitation.  our social needs to care for one another to feel love from others to see prosperity for others to explore and learn together are punished and discouraged under our economic system.  our need as individuals to develop our innate abilities are obstructed by this capitalist anarchy as well.  All our energies and focus are dedicated to either keeping our head afloat or staying above water.  And our whole education system is geared towards the narrowly focused and singular development of our ability to compete with and combat one another.  And it's this choking of the individual, this reduction of the individual, the denial of the individual's full potential that Einstein denounces as the worst evil of capitalism.  You can't study the things that interest you unless it's profitable.  You can't do the things that interest you unless it's profitable.  You can't pursue anything unless it's profitable.  This is a tight noose around the individual.  I am convinced there is only one way to eliminate these grave evils, namely through the establishment of a socialist economy.  in such an economy the means of production are owned by society itself and are utilized in a planned fashion.  well put comrade einstein in abolishing private control we no longer have petty tyrants running around making their own and often contradictory economic decisions blind to the happenings of other economic victims.  Instead, we now have an economy owned and controlled by the people, in which information about the conditions of production flows freely between all sectors of the economy, and allows for the informed direction of economic output to meet the needs and wants of society.  here we have an economy which eliminates the waste of capitalist anarchy and allows for the full realization of the economy's potential.  A point I want to make is that under capitalism, a lot of our technological advancements are put towards the narrow pursuit of profits.  But under a socialist economy, these technological advancements can be used to their full potential of meeting the needs and wants of society.  Instead of social media wildly pulling every lever in my reptilian brain to keep me on the platform for as long as possible to collect my private data and push another ad, These technological capabilities can be used to collect information on the conditions of production in all corners of the economy, record accurate data on consumption levels and project trends, issue instantaneous corrections to plans in accordance to new information, identify successful policies and methods that can be repeated, and so on.  So you know, it's real easy to look at an iPhone and recognize it as technologically sophisticated, but you need to be willing to go a step further and see its full potential and how it's being utterly squandered.  Instead of allowing unelected individuals to control and make unilateral economic decisions and thus come to dictate all spheres of life, democratic rule in the economy, in which officials are elected and recallable at any time, means the establishment of a truly democratic society.  under this planned economy when i work hard i'm not hurting you.  when you work hard you're not hurting me.  in fact when we work hard we raise the standard of living for all.  it's in both our interests to help one another in production to maximize our efficiency.  this is a cooperative economic system in which we can pursue our social needs and not be punished.  It's an economic system which encourages us to embrace the fulfillment of these social needs.  That doesn't mean there is no competition under socialism.  You can have friendly competition between firms and factories and different metrics and have rewards accordingly.  But the difference between socialist competition and capitalist competition is that this is not a life or death knife fight.  sporting matches are an apt example of the real kind of competitiveness and striving that can come from friendly competition with the added bonus that all participants are still alive at the end and can learn from their mistakes and learn from the winners and can come back tomorrow and try again.  the whole economy itself is structured to meet the needs and wants of her voters.  This includes providing the necessary resources and time needed to make the pursuit of personal and individual development possible.  Labour saving technology and scientific advancements are constantly put towards reducing the labour time needed from workers, the establishment and expansion of public recreational facilities, free access to knowledge and education at all levels and paces, the creation and development of hobbyist clubs and workshops, guided by professionals in the field and so on.  This is how you foster innovation.  Let the people freely learn.  Make it as easy as possible for all people to develop their innate abilities and potentials.  In summary, Einstein was a pretty chill dude.  I want to thank all of my patrons who've chosen to support me and continue to support me.  Each and every one of you is based like my boy Einstein.
