            "text": "Shalom.  I'm Messianic Rabbi Zev Porat.  We are in the feast of dedication, the feast of Hanukkah.  Yeshua, Jesus, is the Hanukkah, is the light of the world, is the perfect seven-lampstand menorah.  I have behind me two menorahs, two lampstands.  One is a biblical lampstand.  And the other one is not.  The biblical one is the seven lampstand menorah representing Yeshua, Jesus, the light of the world.  And the nine stick menorah lampstand is the one invented by the Pharisees, by the religious leaders, the ones who don't believe in Yeshua and Jesus.  It's very important that we understand this because the Bible says in Romans chapter 11, verse 11, that we are to provoke the Jews to jealousy.  Well, how can we provoke them to jealousy if we're not preaching the true gospels?  So it's very, very important to bring that up.  We love the Jewish people.  We love the Orthodox Jews, but we cannot love people over righteousness.  We must preach the truth.  Jesus, Yeshua warned about this in many places in the Bible.  We'll take just one example.  Matthew chapter 15, verse three.  And Yeshua answered them.  And I'm paraphrasing.  Why do you break the commandment of God for the sake of your own tradition?  So Yeshua, Jesus warned the Pharisees, warned the religious leaders not to do that.  And he's speaking to us as believers in Yeshua, in his word, not to do that, not to mollify, not to break the commandments of God, the word of God, in order to be a man pleaser.  So we must take the Bible as the authority, not what man preaches.  So this is very, very important, not just for Hanukkah, but for the whole Bible from Genesis to Revelation.  I want to bring out a treasure in the Bible today.  So we see in Exodus 25, Moses was given instructions to put the lampstand in the tabernacle to be a light.  So we see in John chapter 10, verse 22 and 23, that Yeshua, Jesus, celebrated the feast of dedication.  It also says that he walked into Solomon's colonnade.  And this is actually where Yeshua was proclaiming himself to be the light of the world.  Very important to realize when the Bible mentions that it was on Solomon's port, Solomon's colonnade, it's very important because if you know anything about the biblical times, you know that Solomon's colonnade was pointing eastward.  And eastward is the Mount of Olives.  Very important because the Bible says that the glory of the Lord departed from the east.  And the Bible says that the glory of the Lord will come back from the east.  And we know that Yeshua, he's going to return as the high priest, the lion of the tribe of Judah.  The Bible says that his feet are going to land on the Mount of Olives.  And the Mount of Olives is pointing eastward.  So it was a foreshadow of his first and second coming.  Why do we say first and second coming?  Because when Yeshua was walking in Solomon's colonnade, He didn't go to the cross yet.  So he was proclaiming himself to be the Messiah, the one that will give up his spirit for the people on the cross, on the tree.  And it was also pointing to his second coming when he will return to the Mount of Olives and his feet will land there.  So he's walking in Solomon's colonnade in the Feast of Dedication, in the Feast of Hanukkah, proclaiming himself to be the light of the world, the perfect seven lampstand menorah.  If we want to understand the back of the book, we need to go to the front of the book.  It says in the front of the book, in the book of Exodus, that the lampstand was given to be in the temple, to give light.  We know that Yeshua is the light of the world.  And let's have a look at Hanukkah in a deeper way here, as we're going to look at some amazing Bible passages that are going to shed some light on the deepness and the depths of Hanukkah, the Feast of Dedication.  In Revelation 1, verse 13, and I'm going to paraphrase it, it says, And I saw one standing in the midst of the seven lampstands, in the midst of the lampstand.  That's very, very important because if I'm taking a biblical lampstand right here, and you think about the seven, the perfect seven.  So we see here that book of Revelation is that same lampstand that was proclaimed to Moses.  Remember in Exodus, Moses was instructed to put a seven lampstand menorah, seven lampstand menorah in the tabernacle to be a light.  And now we see in the book, that's in the front of the book.  Now we see in the end of the book, in the kingdom of God, We see one standing in the midst of the seven lampstand.  Once again, that midst of the seven lampstand is speaking about Yeshua the Messiah.  And the Bible says in the book of Revelation, there'll be no more sun, there'll be no more moon, but Yeshua himself will be the light.  That's the key.  When he said, I'm the light of the world, he is the light of the world.  And that's perfect.  seven lampstand menorah, which is Yeshua really prophetically.  is what's going to give that light.  That's why the Bible says in the book of Revelation, there'll be no more light, there'll be no more moon, but Yeshua himself will be the light.  Jesus will be the light.  He is that perfect seven-lambstand menorah.  And I saw one standing in the midst of the menorah.  That's Yeshua, Jesus, the light of the world.  But we're going to have a look even deeper at this.  If we listen to a lot of teachings out there, a lot of tradition, they sound very interesting, and there's a lot of adventures out there.  trying to follow the rabbis in the name of Yeshua and justify their teachings.  Ephesians 5.11 says, and I'm paraphrasing, we're not to have anything to do with the deeds of darkness, but rather expose them.  So that's what we're doing here today.  We're exposing the deeds of darkness because we cannot love people over righteousness.  The true gospel needs to be preached.  The perfect seven lampstand menorah, Yeshua, Jesus.  And I saw one standing in the midst of the lampstand.  That's Jesus.  Now in tradition teaching, And unfortunately, we say tradition, that's the rabbis, the Pharisees, the ones who don't believe in Yeshua.  But unfortunately, also some believers have adopted this teaching in the name of Yeshua.  But you can't do that because Jesus already said, do not mollify the tradition.  Do not mollify the Bible.  Do not change the Bible from the tradition of man.  So if you look at a lot of teachings out there say that the nine stick menorah, the middle one is called the shamash.  The shamash in English is translated servant.  That's a correct translation, but the shamash in Hebrew, the word servant has a much, much deeper prophetic meaning than just a servant.  But I want to touch about what they're teaching in tradition because you'll probably hear about this or you've heard about this before, but it's just tradition.  It's not biblical, and it certainly doesn't open the gospel.  So they say that the middle one is the shamash, the servant, that he's the one used to light the eight candles, one candle every day.  But Yeshua... He is the servant.  So they got one thing right, because in every lie, there's a little bit true.  So is the middle one a servant?  Absolutely.  I'm going to show you in the Bible that the middle one is the servant in a prophetic way.  I'm going to show you something very, very amazing in the Bible in regard with the lampstand.  So the question has to be asked when the lampstand was burning in the temple, was it burning one day at a time or was it burning eight days in the miracles?  It was burning all the menorah.  The whole menorah was burning.  Was it a nine stick menorah?  Was it a seven lampstand menorah?  It was a seven lampstand menorah because that's a biblical menorah.  So the whole lampstand burns every day for eight days.  All of it, not one by one.  Very important to realize.  In Genesis 1.1, the Bible says, in the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.  The Bible says in the book of John that in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was God.  So we know that Yeshua is the Word, and Yeshua is God.  Very, very important when we're looking at the lampstand, because if we read Genesis 1-1 in Hebrew, it reads like this.  You know how many words that is?  Seven.  Right there in Genesis 1, in the beginning of the book, Already we can see the perfect lampstand, seven.  There are seven words in Hebrew in Genesis 1-1.  Like this, It's amazing.  But it gets even better because we read the book of Revelation where it says, I am the Alpha and the Omega.  But that's not what it says in Hebrew.  In Hebrew it says, I am the Aleph and I am the Tath.  Aleph being the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet.  Tach being the last.  I am the Aleph and I am the Tach.  Who is, who was, and is to come.  We read that in Revelation.  So we saw that in the book of Genesis, we have seven words for in the God created the heavens and the earth.  In Hebrew.  It's the perfect seven lampstand menorah.  But the middle of that, the middle word, right in the middle, right here in the middle, is the word Et.  and et is alpha and omega, aleph and ataph.  And I saw one standing in the midst of the lampstand.  So we can see that the midst of the lampstand is the great I am, Yeshua HaMashiach.  The Bible is amazing.  It's mind-blowing.  But if you're looking at a nine-stick menorah, and you're not looking at a seven-lampstand menorah, how are you going to see all these treasures?  How are you going to preach the true gospel to the Jews that are celebrating Hanukkah, but they don't see the light of the?  You won't see it.  And that's why it's so important that the truth, and I'm just touching on the surface here.  I can get much, much deeper, but just to show you Genesis and Revelation, how they tie together.  The perfect seven lampstand menorah.  It's absolutely amazing.  It's mind-blowing.  Praise Yeshua.  We give him all the glory.  We're small people with a big God.  Malachi chapter four, verse two says, but you who fear the Lord, the son of righteousness will rise with healing in its wings.  Now the son of righteousness, S-U-N, son, What does that mean?  It means light, but the question has to be asked, why does it say the son of righteousness?  Well, there is a biblical treasure mystery there that is often overlooked.  Song of Solomon is a love story between Yeshua and his bride.  And in the love story between Yeshua and his bride, we can see why it says in Malachi 4.2, the son of righteousness.  So let's have a look at Song of Solomon, chapter 6, verse 10. mizot who is this?  as beautiful as the moon bright as the sun?  so here we can see again the word sun just like we saw in malachi 4 2 son of righteousness will shine on him.  and this is the key because it says as beautiful as the moon shining like the sun.  and i'm paraphrasing there in song of solomon very important because if we know anything about the moon it reflects the light of the sun.  what it says here in the song of solomon is that the bride is as beautiful as the moon.  What it's speaking about is reflecting the light from the sun.  The bride is beautiful because she gets her light from the sun.  And the sun is really speaking about Yeshua HaMashiach.  He is the light.  Although it says S-U-N, it's a foreshadow of the light coming from Yeshua, coming from God.  And the bride is as beautiful as the moon because she's reflecting The light from the sun becoming Christ-like, becoming Yeshua-like.  This is why Yeshua said, you are the light of the world, Matthew 5, 14, because you're reflecting that light.  And this really makes Malachi 4, 2 much more clear where it says, you fear the Lord, the son of righteousness shall rise.  What's the son of righteousness?  It's that light shining on the moon.  The moon is referred to as the bride over here, as beautiful as the moon.  And she's reflecting that light back.  She's becoming Christ-like, Yeshua-like.  And that is the true Hanukkah.  Understanding that Yeshua is the light of the world.  Mizot, who is this?  As beautiful as the moon.  The bride is referred to as beautiful as the moon because she's reflecting the light from the sun, the sun of righteousness, the one we read in Malachi 4, verse 2.  Yeshua is the perfect lampstand.  I pray you and your loved ones have a happy and blessed Feast of Dedication.  And how do we celebrate the Feast of Dedication Hanukkah?  as believers in Yeshua, by following his word, not following man's tradition, by looking at these Bible verses and understanding that he is the light of the world.  And that light shines through us.  We are the kalah, the bride, as beautiful as the moon, because she's reflecting the light from the sun.  And therefore, Malachi 4.2, the son of righteousness is flowing through us.  It's really the glory of God.  May you and your loved ones have a happy, and blessed feast of dedication, Hanukkah, as we work the harvest together as the one new man, Ephesians 2.15, bring the gospel back to Jerusalem and go home.  I'm Messianic Rabbi Zev Porat sending you blessings from Israel in the mighty name of the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, Al Yehudah, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, Jesus Yeshua, Amen.  Every knee shall bow and every tongue will confess that Yeshua, Jesus, is Lord.  Hallelujah. ",
