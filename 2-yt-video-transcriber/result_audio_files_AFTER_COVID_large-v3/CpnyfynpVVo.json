Because we wear clothes all the time.  We are never exposed to the elements of nature, to cold, to heat, to pressure.  It's always neutral, neutral.  It's like a muscle and you don't train it.  It's there, but it is this.  That is our vascular system.  Our vascular system is 100,000 kilometers long inside everybody.  And the thermal receptors and the electrical receptors, they end up in our biggest organ of ours, which is the skin.  We always got it covered.  Logically, we have a cardiovascular related epidemic, pandemic going on for hundreds of years already.  And now I say, cold shower a day keeps the doctor away. ",

You activate, you stimulate deeply the thermoreceptors and the pain receptor, thermoreceptors, electroreceptors, which is the neurology.  all connected to the skin.  They, in turn, they affect the vascular system, the cardiovascular system.  Millions of little muscles suddenly are stimulated.  They begin to optimize.  Then the blood flow goes a lot better through the system.  That is number one.  It reaches a lot better our cells with oxygen, nutrients, and vitamins.  That's why a cold shower gives you energy.  Then the second thing, if you regularly, you begin with 30 seconds, then you do 45 seconds, one minute, one minute and a quarter, et cetera.  You go up to two and a half minutes a day.  Why?  Because that is the vascular fitness exercise the best.  Then cardiovascular-related diseases, and that is also inflammation into the heart.  Inflammation into our neurology is goodbye.  How simple.  What happens?  that the heart rate, when all these little millions of little primitive muscles in the hundreds of thousands of blood vessels inside are activated, optimized, then the heart rate suddenly doesn't need to compensate for the loss of the vascular condition.  And then the heart rate will go down with 20 to 30 beats a minute, 24 hours a day.  You see what kind of stress that would be?  If you have a weak vascular system in tone, then it takes maybe years, maybe 10 years, maybe 20 years, but it will take its toll.  Because the heart rate, when it goes up, it triggers directly the liver to release cortisol.  and glucose.  It's like you are in fight and flight because the function of our accelerated heart rate is to pump glucose and adrenaline through our system the fast as possible.  But now there is a constant danger signal going on because of our way.  That's why cardiovascular related diseases, arteriosclerosis, It's logical because the blood flow is not helped with these millions of little muscles who are weakened.  They are not stimulated.  And then the heart rate needs to pump 20 to 30 a minute, 24 hours a day, day in, day out, day in.  Hey, man, it will take its toll soon or later.  So the people, they got to wake up, cold shower.  The best thing you can do for yourself is a cold shower. ",

Hey, if you have a condition, Annie, then it is because of the system, there is a defect going on.  It will boost at that moment the system and it will go through a good job.  So that's why I say safety first, 30 seconds to begin with.  But within 10 days, anybody is able to do the same, to go to two and a half minutes, no problem.  Cold shower. ",

It really improves within 10 days the cardiovascular system, which is directly related to the neurology, by the way, yeah?  Neurologic, the opening and closing of all those, the activating of those muscles to open and close all the veins, arteries, and capillaries, I mean 100,000 kilometers, is done by the neurology, the nervous system.
