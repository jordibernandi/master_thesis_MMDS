            "text": "Hey, what's up, my bros?  This is Bro Spencer here, and I'm dressed as a bro pastor right now because we're going to deal with the bro of all bros, Bro Steven Furtick, and how he doesn't understand what Bible harmonetics is and how most charismatic preachers have no idea how to interpret the Bible, which is why they go into such false error all the time.  So God has a word for you in this video, and I want you to watch this thing all the way through to the end so that you can receive the blessing that God has for you in this hour, man.  It's going to be rad.  It's going to be cool.  And you need to just stay with me to the very end.  God bless you as you receive what God has for you.  Okay, I can't do that anymore.  I'm sorry.  This is your friend Spencer here.  And we're going to talk about false teachers and how they manipulate the Bible and how they basically use the Bible to make it say whatever they want.  I remember a couple of years ago, I was in Bible College in Knoxville, Tennessee.  We were going door knocking with a couple of people.  And I went with this one guy.  He's a great fellow.  And his name was Nathan.  And me and Nathan were knocking doors.  And this woman came to the door and we invited her to church.  And And she said, oh, I'm so glad you guys are here.  And I noticed that she was lifting her hands.  She had tattoos on her wrist, and she had something on her neck there.  And she says, I'm a Christian, and I love the Lord, and I serve the Lord with all my heart, mind, and soul.  And I said, well, praise the Lord, ma'am.  That's wonderful.  And she said, you know, God has a ministry for me that has tattoos.  I am a tattoo ministry person.  And I thought, wow.  Okay, sure, sure.  And she looked and she did this with her ear and she pulled her ear up and inside her ear was this tattoo of a gecko.  And she said, I won first place at a CTC with this tattoo.  And I had no idea what that was.  And the guy next to me, he's white as a ghost, man.  He was so uncomfortable.  And I said, well, ma'am, what's a CTC?  And she said, oh, a CTC?  You've never been to a CTC?  And I said, no, ma'am, I've never been to a CTC.  And she said, a CTC is a Christian tattoo convention.  And I said, what?  When I looked at the guy next to me, and he's ready to faint.  I mean, he just can't handle it.  And I looked at her, and I said, tell me more.  And he was just ready to go, my buddy there.  And I said, please, please inform me more about this.  And she said, well, you know, Paul said, I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.  And so these are my marks of the Lord Jesus.  And I said, ma'am, you've got to explain this to me.  I want to know how this works.  I want to know what your thoughts on this are.  And she says, well, you know how you guys right now are going door to door and trying to tell people to come to church and trying to give people the gospel?  And I said, yeah.  And she says, we do that, but we just do a little bit different.  I said, okay, how do you do that?  And she reached and tried to pull down the back of her collar of her shirt.  She says, you know, back there, I have a bunch of Bible verses on my back.  And every couple of months I go to the tattoo parlor and I get something added to it.  And she says, every time that I pull that Bible verse out and I let them see that Bible verse, that Bible verse ministers to the person who's giving me a tattoo.  And I thought, oh, we have hit the jackpot of crazy.  This is amazing.  And I said, ma'am, I need to know more.  And part of the reason was I was curious.  Another part was I was just trying to aggravate my buddy.  She brought us into the house.  I actually handed us one of her church bulletins.  Her and her husband were there, her husband.  And they had Bible verses all over the wall in the house.  And And they handed me a bulletin.  They showed me the bulletin.  I noticed that the first verse on that bulletin was right here in Isaiah chapter number 43, verse 19.  Behold, I will do a new thing.  Now it shall spring forth.  Shall you not know it?  I will even make a way in the desert, a way in the wilderness and rivers in the desert.  That was their verse on their bulletin.  And I said, why do y'all use that verse?  He told me, he said, well, God's going to do a new thing today.  We believe in doing a different thing than the traditional.  You guys probably use hymns and stuff, but we use more progressive, more up-to-date stuff because we just believe that God is doing new things, man, all over the world.  He's doing new things.  The first thought that went through my mind was, anything newer than the New Testament is heretical.  And I thought, that cannot be what this verse is teaching.  That cannot be a proof text justifying your use of heretical, modernistic practices.  That cannot be your proof text for using rock and roll in your church service, Christian rap and whatever.  And she went to tell me that she was the leader of the dance team and all that stuff where they do interpretive dances and all that type of stuff while they're singing songs and whatever.  And I thought, that cannot be what that verse is teaching.  And so I went and studied it, and sure enough, that is not what Isaiah chapter 43 is talking about.  People are using these proof texts as a means to justify their heretical practices, and that's what all these charismatic guys do.  Now, Stephen Furtick is no different.  He uses the Bible to prove his message rather than allowing his message be the Bible.  and using illustrations to shed light on what the Bible is actually saying.  Now, most people won't get what I just said, okay?  There's two types of preachers in the world.  There's those who have a message and use the Bible to support their message.  And then there's another crowd who uses the Bible as the message and lets the Bible be the message and uses... illustrations and other types of concepts to illustrate what the Bible is actually saying.  Let me just give you four things.  This is how all of these people work, and this is how all false teachers work, okay?  What they do is they read a verse without any context, dismiss the literal interpretation of that, and they run like a bullet out of a gun right to allegorize that text and spiritualize that text.  They use the text, their allegorical interpretation of that text, to make the Bible basically say whatever they want it to.  Number four is that their delivery is so exciting and so likable that everybody just seems to miss the fact that what they just said was heretical.  That's how it all works.  Read the text out of context, rush like a bullet out of a gun to the allegorical interpretation of it, spiritualize it to the point where it's just whatever, and then have the delivery so exciting and so charismatic and so winsome that nobody even notices that you said anything wrong.  That's how all these people operate.  And Furtick is no different.  And so let's just watch this for a second.  I had a first-time thing.  I was stomping the devil's head on the stage last week.  It was at the 930.  I was icing my heel between the 930 and the 1130.  I stomped him too hard, and he bit me or something.  My heel is bruised all week.  Somebody said, welcome to your 40s.  You're going to start getting all kinds of stupid injuries.  What a way to get injured, huh?  Stomping the devil's head.  Now, I'm almost 40, and I can identify with that, but that's just a side note there.  Come on, I've got hurt a lot stupider ways than that.  The Bible said that he will bruise your heel, but you will crush his head.  That's a scripture verse.  Okay, now that is a prime example of what I'm talking about right there.  What he's referring to is called by theologians the Proto-Evangelium, which is Genesis chapter 3 and verse 15.  It's actually the very first promise of redemption in the Bible.  God is speaking in the garden to Adam and Eve in verse 15.  He says this to Satan, I will put enmity between thee.  That's talking about the Lord Jesus Christ at Calvary.  When Jesus died on Calvary, his heel was bruised, but Satan's head was bruised.  That is what that's talking about.  That is not talking about stomping in a church service and hurting your foot.  So what he did there, he allegorized that text.  and spun it into a prosperity gospel interpretation of that, which is not even close to what the Bible is actually teaching there in that promise.  It's just amazing that he would take the very first promise of redemption in all of the scriptures, and bypass that it was to Satan, bypass Calvary, bypass the whole implications of the fallen nature of man, and rush to allegorize that text... so that he can put a prosperity, health, and wealth spin on it.  I mean, this is disgusting.  This is just disgusting what these people do to the Scriptures.  What he just did.  there is a typical example of allegorical interpretation of the Scripture.  Let's go on to another verse.  Leviticus 26.10 The Lord says, You will still be eating last year's harvest when you will have to move it out to make room for the new.  We read that together.  Leviticus 26, verse 10, I got it right here in my Bible.  You should eat the old store and bring forth the old because of the new.  And so he's going to take that verse and give no context, give no grammatical, literal, historical interpretation of that.  He's just going to run to the allegorical interpretation.  He's going to make it say whatever he wants it to say and apply it.  however he wants to apply it to your Christian life, puts a health and wealth spin on that.  And actually what he's going to do with the rest of the sermon is he's going to justify his modernistic methods looking at it again, and I texted it over to Bishop T.D.  Jakes.  I said, what is it?  That ought to kind of bother you right there.  If you're a Bible-believing Christian, the fact that he is so enamored with T.D.  Jakes, that ought to send a red flag up there.  But that's just my opinion, so here we go.  He said, oh, that's a good one.  And he preached about it.  And that was good.  Well, The phrase that I want to use and put it up there again is where it says, make room for the new.  And the Lord told me to tell you today, make room for the new.  This is a word from the Lord for somebody who is in this room or at one of our campuses.  Come on, let's thank God for all of our location.  Okay, so this is what he does.  He says, all right, this is what the Bible says.  Make room for the new.  And so he takes five words out of the book of Leviticus and gives no context, no understanding, no, I mean, there's no thing before it, nothing after it.  There's nothing like that.  And he just says, make room for the new.  And you shall eat the old store and bring forth the old because of the new.  Here's the thing, and he says, this is a word from God.  God is going to tell you that you need to get rid of the old because God's going to bring in the new.  Can I get a witness?  Can I get an amen?  No context runs to an allegorical interpretation of that.  He manipulates the text to make it say whatever he wants it to say.  And in this case, he does a prosperity, health, and wealth spin on that.  And then the delivery is so exciting and likable that nobody even catches it.  No context runs to an allegorical interpretation of that.  He manipulates the text to make it say whatever he wants it to say.  And in this case, he does a prosperity, health, and wealth spin on that.  And then the delivery is so exciting and likable that nobody even catches it.  Did you notice that after he read that verse and gave the word, he said, hey, let's talk about our rally guide.  Everybody just kind of starts cheering and kind of changes the subject, goes in and out to make himself more likable and relatable.  That's what these heretics always do.  Now, most of these heretics are very likable people.  That's the snare and the trap of all that.  because you think, Well, I like that guy.  Well, I like that guy.  Well, yeah, I mean, I guess I like the guy too, but he's still a heretic.  That's the bridge that most people can't cross.  Look in verse number 22 of the previous chapter.  You shall sow the eighth year and eat yet of old fruit until the ninth year.  Until her fruits come in, ye shall eat of the old store.  What he does in his interpretation of that verse in Leviticus chapter 26 is he says, God has a new thing for you.  God has a new and exciting thing for you.  And you need to embrace this new and exciting thing that God has.  And he applies that to his ministry, to his church and the contemporary movement as a whole.  God has a new thing that you need to have.  Well, I can play that same game and use this verse and say, until her fruits come in, you shall eat of the old store.  And I can say, you know, God has a word.  This new stuff is just out of hell and you need to go back to the old store, the old past, the old interpretation, the old religions, the old preachers.  You need to go back to the old.  And so I can preach a whole message on that and say, look back to the old stuff and forget this new contemporary.  So I can do that.  And my message would just be as valid as his.  I've got a great book here.  This is Things to Come by Dwight Pentecost.  This is a great book.  I think every Christian needs to have this in your library.  I'm going to take this big fat ring off because that's just weird to me.  Here's what he says, the dangers of the allegorical method of interpretation.  What I mean by that is what Furtick did there where he just takes a verse and spiritualizes it and makes it say whatever he wants to say.  Now there's a difference between using an allegory.  There's figurative language, there's types, there's allegories in the Bible, but That is not interpreting it allegorically.  So here's the first danger in allegorical interpretation, that it does not interpret Scripture.  It doesn't interpret Scripture.  There's no cross-referencing.  There's no comparing Scripture with Scripture.  The greatest commentary on the Bible is the Bible itself.  The second great danger of the allegorical method is the basic authority and interpretation ceases to be the Scripture but the mind of the interpreter.  That's a big deal because there are a lot of people out there that are making the Bible say whatever they want it to say.  And like I said at the beginning, there's two types of preachers.  There's those who have a message and let the Bible be a proof text to support their message.  And then the second preacher is the one who lets the Bible be the message and then illustrates what the Bible is actually saying.  And he says the third great danger in the allegorical method is that one is left without any means by which the conclusions of the interpreter may be tested.  Now, the Bible says when Paul went to a certain area, he met with the people called Bereans.  And the Bible says that the Bereans searched the scriptures, whether those things were so.  Meaning that Paul said, you know, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the church age is here.  That's what we're doing.  It's a mystery revealed.  You know, they took it and said, show me, show me, put... Put it in print.  Tell me where it is.  And if Paul couldn't do that, then had to back up on that.  And the Bible says that they were noble.  The Bible says that that was a good thing.  And here's what happens is that this judge not mentality, it's like a bear trap goes off.  When you criticize their heretical heroes, instantly, judge not.  That is as anti-Christian as Hinduism.  That is not Christianity, what you're just saying.  If I say that Jesus Christ is not the son of God, and the Bible says Jesus Christ is the son of God, then you need to forget what I'm saying and allow the Bible to speak for itself.  And that's my point here.  I just want to point you to the Bible and point you away from these personality cults, which is what most of these churches are, where they love the man so much and they're so enamored with the man that they lose sight of the fact that what he's saying is not even scriptural.  That is a dangerous thing.  The life verse of heretics need to be what's on my shirt.  I can do all things through a verse out of context.  And that's what they do.  That's how they operate.  And they can manipulate you when you don't understand literal historical interpretation of the scriptures.  That's just basic Harmonetics 101 right there.  I'm glad I took a course on that in college because it allowed me to learn what the Bible is actually saying.  Philippians 4.13, I can do all things through Christ which strengthens me.  That has nothing to do with you being drafted into the NFL.  That has nothing to do with you being drafted into the NBA.  That has nothing to do with you running for president.  And that has nothing to do with you being able to get a personal best on a bench press or something like that.  That has nothing to do with that.  You don't understand context.  You are interpreting it allegorically.  And you miss the real message of the Bible.  when you don't do that.  Have you ever bought chicken nuggets before at McDonald's?  Did you know there's chicken nuggets, so there's like almost no chicken in those chicken nuggets?  It's designed to look like chicken and to smell like chicken and even to taste like chicken, but there's actually very little chicken in those chicken nuggets.  What you're eating is all kinds of odds and ends ground up and put together in some sort of paste.  mashed together in these little bite-sized pieces and then heated and warmed and flavored to your delight so that it'll please your palate.  But there's actually very little chicken in those things.  I hate to burst your bubble.  The same is true of these false teaching heretics that are out there today.  Even though they're likable and even though what they say sounds Christian and may smell Christian and even may to some degree taste like Christianity, the truth is there's very little Christianity in this.  And once you realize that, once you get a taste of the real thing, then these cheap substitutes just won't satisfy anymore.  So, hey, subscribe to our channel, ladies and gentlemen.  We love you.  Please forgive me for dressing like this.  It's actually just out of my comfort zone.  So God bless you, friend, and pray for us. ",
