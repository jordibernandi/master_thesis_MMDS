The first category relates to criminal surveillance, and that's the mechanism by which federal prosecutors obtain authority from courts to operate a wiretap on a telephone line or to surveil an email account.  And that's all related to having probable cause to believe that that individual is engaged in criminal activity.  There's a second category of surveillance that relates to the collection of foreign intelligence, and that is much more of a national security tool.  It's governed by what's known as the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which has been amended many times.  That's another category of surveillance in which agents of foreign powers or foreign powers are surveilled to collect foreign intelligence information for use by the U.S.  government. ",

My office was in  D.C.,  but at that time I was living in Burlington, Vermont.  He wanted to schedule a meeting to meet, and I was at that time just trying to build up my practice.  I knew of Glenn Greenwald because I had read the newspaper articles and, you know, everything that came out about Edward Snowden, but I did not know him personally.  So I went to New York and we met at a hotel.  And at that time, Glenn Greenwald asked if my email address was what my email address was.  He read that to me.  He goes, is this your email address?  I said, yes, it is.  And then he said, well, I'm sorry to tell you, but you've been under surveillance by the NSA since 2006.  And then I asked him, well, how do you know the NSA was spying on me?  And then he basically said, well, the documents that Edward Snowden took, if this is your email address, this is the email address that NSA was spying on.  And I think I asked him also, were there any other people being spied on?  Was it just me?  And then he said there was a few other prominent Muslims that were being spied on along with me.  You know, before this happened to me, when people would ask me, hey, do you think minorities are picked on more?  I would always say, absolutely not.  That's just complete nonsense.  But now, as I look at the statistics, I absolutely think that that is the case.  The reason the NSA was spying on me is because of my religion and because of the fact that I'm active in Muslim issues. ",
