And you pointed out, because you've got your new series of Afterlife coming out, that probably the best way to watch it isn't in one block.  But I'm afraid I did on Thursday night.  I started watching it, and it is kind of difficult to turn off.  So I watched all six episodes.  Great stuff.  Really interesting TV.  Well worth watching.  everybody tuning into.  I love the first series.  Second series, equally as good.  It's a series about grief and loss, basically.  Not necessarily the best subject for humour, but it's at times hysterically funny, and at other times, very, very emotional.  But I'm fascinated with the role of the dog, which is called Brandy in the series, and I think Auntie in real life.  Now, Clearly, for your character, Tony, Brandy is crucial to his survival, in a way. ",

I mean, it started off as a bit of a joke, and even the fact that it's about grief, it was never meant to be a study in grief.  It was a jumping-off point, so... um the the usually with sitcom the character comes first.  you know i had david brent before the office i had derrick before derrick and then you find a place for it.  yeah um but here it rather like a movie that the concept came first.  so the first seed in my head was imagine if you were gonna kill yourself and you didn't um.  everything else would be a bonus.  you'd be Nothing could scare you you could do anything.  and if if life got too much you can always fall back on suicide.  And the joke was it was like a superpower.  That was the concept.  the next thing I thought of was Well, what's the worst thing for me?  It was losing your soul mate your life partner.  So that was settled.  and then the next thing was why didn't he kill himself?  because the dog was hungry?  comedic, but I think very very real as well.  and so I all that came to my head in like the first two minutes like the big bang and then then you write it and then it.  then it becomes a study in grief because it's it's a character trait really for him because we know what he used to be like.  then i thought of the.  she leaves him a message.  now we see his life and what i found was that people let tony get away with stuff because he was in pain.  It was like a wounded animal.  So all his friends and the audience, you know, let him go through all these terrible things.  he does and thinks, because we know he's wounded and he's not thinking straight.  And he's searching for something.  Like we all are.  We just want to be happy, okay?  That's all we want.  We just want to be happy until we die.  And he's going through the seven stages of grief.  So we hit the ground running.  with series one, you know, shock, anger, denial.  And now he's going through negotiating phase.  He's saying to the world, okay, why should I stay around?  What should I do?  How can I find happiness?  And he sort of decides, well, maybe it's about sharing.  It's about giving back, you know.  the old lady in the graveyard, that was the kindness of strangers.  Yes, yes.  She's his guardian angel.  We all need someone like her, you know.  And so he's starting thinking about stuff, really.  And the big question, the big question the whole series asked, if you could reduce it down to one thing, is this.  If you lose everything, is life still worth living?  And how?  That's it. ",

I was just laughing, you know.  They make you feel better.  And particularly, another theme to the show is it's important to be needed.  And so the dog needs him.
