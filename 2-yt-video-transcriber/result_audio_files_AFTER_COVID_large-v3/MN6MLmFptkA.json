If this isn't done right, if it's not done by the book, not about counting every vote, it's about upholding the Constitution, upholding state laws, decision by state legislatures and so forth.  If this isn't done right this time, even though it impacts this presidential election, we're going to have a disaster every four years.  And it's going to get worse and worse with the litigation, with courts interfering with state legislatures, with violations of deadlines, with other parties not being able to be present when there's counts taking place.  This stuff needs to be resolved now, does it not? ",

Look, no, everyone would agree that in the middle of the Super Bowl, you know, one of the coaches for one of the teams should not go to the referee and say, listen, we need to change the rules applying to the current game.  and that's exactly what has happened this year in the election process.  we had lawsuits filed all over the country and we had judges both state court judges and federal judges trying to change the rules not not just before the election but in the middle of the election when the voting had already started early into absentee ballots across the country and relaxing quite frankly, the needed rules to maintain the security, for example, of absentee ballots.  That is just not the way you conduct an election.  It's dangerous. ",

Number one, the U.S.  Supreme Court so far has failed to uphold the federal constitution, and in doing so, put an end to some of these activities that are going on that benefit one party against another.  It's really appalling.  And until the Supreme Court steps in and puts its foot down and upholds Article 2, Section 1, Clause 2, and upholds it, without any ambiguity, this is going to continue, and it's going to raise questions about elections.  But here's the other problem, or the second problem, Hans.  And that is this.  If you can't trust the numbers that are coming out in one state or another, or in one city or another, then the legitimacy of the presidency is on the line each and every time, is it not? ",

And then when you dare to raise it and say, wait a minute, Full stop.  The state legislature gets to decide how the electors are chosen.  You're accused of trying to oppress, suppress racism, disenfranchisement and all the usual pablum that we get from the left now.  On another topic, but it's very important.  We now see individuals saying we need to keep a list of people who have been associated with this administration, almost an enemy's list.  You've seen it by AOC.  You've seen it by Jennifer Rubin.

And she calls for anyone like that to be exiled from society and to not be given a job in the government, in academia and in private industry.
