            "text": "I'm going to take this button today.  No you can't.  This is my favorite button right now.  It says, it is better to die on your feet than to live on your knees.  James, over here, this guy's a psycho.  Get out of my face.  They're in your face?  You're the one following me.  You're the one following me.  You see?  Get out of my face!  Get out of my face!  What are you trying to do?  Fuck you pig!  Fuck you pig!  Fuck you pig!  Fuck you pig!  Yeah, there are real issues that need to be addressed.  And when you get more educated on the issue, then you can start talking to me about it.  I'm going to be a little bold and I'll... Okay.  Okay.  Mental illness is not an excuse to be a jackass.  So then what is your excuse?  45 is the one I believe you're looking for.  Walking in a veil while barefoot.  Okay.  So that one is for the vehicles.  Uh-huh.  And also down here, number 53, failure to obey any directive from an RTD employee or representative related to an RTD operations.  Uh-huh.  So that's to put the shoes on.  You're failing in that directive, okay?  I'm failing in that directive?  Yes, because I asked you to put them shoes on.  But you don't have the lawful authority to make me put shoes on.  While here at RTD, in uniform, I do.  You do?  Do you have the lawful authority to make me dance like a chicken?  Okay, so this is Corporal Jenkins.  You just got promoted.  Congratulations.  Would you care to tell me what we need to do now?  So you have the authority to ask my name and date of birth?  Do you have the authority to demand my name and date of birth?  Which crimes specifically am I suspect of having committed?  They would like your information.  They would like it?  What does the law say about giving them my information?  We're contacting you.  The law says we can maybe ask you to name data.  Okay.  Well, what will happen if I don't provide that?  So it's false information.  if I exercise my Fifth Amendment right to remain silent?  Do you want to ask your sergeant, since he's standing right here?  Sergeant, are you going to allow him to detain me for not producing my identification when I'm not a suspect in a crime?  I can see your names on your flyer right here.  Oh, that's somebody's YouTube channel.  Oh, that's your live stream that we're watching right now?  That's a YouTube channel.  I believe it's your YouTube channel that we're watching.  Well, you may believe whatever you wish, Sergeant.  But my question is, am I being detained by your officers or am I free to leave?  Sir, they're asking that you don't come back because I think you're free to leave.  You're absolutely free to leave.  They're going to ask you not to come back to their facility.  They can ask me not to come back to their facility, but this is a public facility, right?  They still have their rules as far as who they let in past their union.  Well, no, she gave me a tour.  They told me that I couldn't come past the orange line right there.  Okay.  Right, but I asked for a tour.  They were giving other people tours, and Diana was willing to give me a tour, right.  So you're free to go now.  Now your officer's detaining me and telling me that I have to provide him with my identification, and I object to that.  Okay, well, that's fine.  You can object, and now you're free to go.  Okay, so I'm no longer being detained?  No, sir.  You weren't detained at any point.  He was asking for your name and date of birth, which you refused to give, which is fine.  Right, all right, all right.  Thank you.  I appreciate that.  He's a psycho.  Get out of my face, he said.  Get out of my face.  Get out of my face.  Get out of my face.  Get out of my face.  Fuck you, too.  Fuck you, too.  Go fuck yourself, you son of a fucker.  Go fuck yourself.  What the fuck is wrong with you?  What the fuck is wrong with you?  You fat fucking son of a bitch.  You already told me mental illness isn't an excuse, so I don't know why you're continuing to inject yourself.  I was speaking about you, man.  Oh, did you get your mind reading degree from a prominent university?  No, I went out on a limb.  You went out on a limb?  Okay, well, the limb broke.  Gentlemen, we need to talk for a minute, okay?  Here's the thing.  Yes, you are.  Which crime specifically?  Trespassing.  You have been asked to leave the property, okay?  Right now, you are trespassing.  Perfectly.  Awesome.  I totally appreciate that.  Why do we advise you that this is public property?  Actually, this is private property that you're on right now.  Oh, it is?  It is.  Who owns it?  The Adams County government.  Adam's got the government.  Oh, I forgot about his name.  Didn't he run for president?  No, he's not a person.  It's the public.  What the fuck is wrong with you people?  Sir?  No!  No justice, no peace, fuck the police!  No justice, no peace, fuck the police!  Gentlemen, I need your ID, please, so I can write you a summons.  You will be willing to write me a summons?  Yes.  Outstanding.  I need your ID also, please, sir.  Okay, I'm going to place you under arrest then.  You are not placing me under arrest.  You have no right to ask for anything.  Come here.  Do you have any questions for the officer?  I have a number of questions for the officer, actually, and I also have a witness here.  My first question for the officer is, did you file a valid cause of action for this?  You mean while I was there?  Did you file a valid cause of action for this court?  I do not understand the question.  Do you know what a valid cause of action is?  No, that's why I'm asking the reverse question.  Do you know the three elements of a valid cause of action?  Your Honor?  I'm not asking for a judge.  I'm asking you.  Just answer the question.  Okay.  No.  No?  No.  What is the code that you're bringing me in front of this court for?  Which subsection of 803 under the model traffic code published 2010 are you alleging that I violated specifically?  I do not know that code verbatim.  How can you bring a valid cause of action before a court if you do not know the elements of the cause that you're bringing?  I require a formal reading of the code.  You're not going to get a formal reading of the code here, Mr.  Randolph.  I need to have an actual verbatim reading of the code that I'm being charged with on the record.  You're not going to get that.  Well, I certainly do not consent to the jurisdiction of this court if it can't provide the code.  I challenge the court's jurisdiction on any showing of proof that there's proper jurisdiction.  You don't get to challenge the court's jurisdiction in this matter.  You have subjected yourself to this court's jurisdiction.  Well, I've certainly not subjected or acquiesced to any consent to the court's jurisdiction.  You certainly have.  And any time that someone challenges the jurisdiction of the court, nothing else can happen until that jurisdiction is shown on the record.  The officer doesn't know exactly what he's doing.  He's already admitted this.  we're going to move forward and let the record show that the court did not give me a formal reading of the charge.  let the record show that the court did not.  that the court refused to show jurisdiction on the record.  the court doesn't have the authority to determine jurisdiction.  it must be shown on the record.  I don't want you to read the code.  I want to read the code.  I'm not going to lie to you.  Well, if we can't show that I've violated the required elements, essential elements of the code, then you cannot find me guilty.  Then we will do that, and we will proceed lawfully.  But this is supposed to be a lawful court, and the law is the Constitution and Declaration of Independence.  I consent to the law.  I took an oath to support and defend the law.  So if we're not going to proceed under law, then there is no jurisdiction.  And there are essential elements to this charge.  And if the court is not even going to read the charge or allow the charge to be written into the record, then you proceeded your own peril.  And so I'm in there, and it's Judge Stokes, right?  Stokes is super fucking whack, right?  And I'm fiddling around, and I accidentally switched my snap cam to my face.  Okay?  So she got like a few seconds on my face, but she's there like this.  She's... Yeah, I saw it coming.  I didn't see the Adams County one coming.  Oh, no.  I thought it was Denver.  Yeah, totally, totally blindsided.  Yeah, I didn't see the Adams.  I didn't think Adams County had something like that.  Well, when I say I see it and saw it coming, I mean, I sort of had the details of the dream, you know, that this is the kind of case that's coming.  Right.  But it's going to be a barrage of... felony cases and let's hope not yeah. ",
