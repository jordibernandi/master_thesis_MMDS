            "text": "Hi.  The YouTuber Vorsch recently made a video in which he argued that the theory of Marxist thinkers like Lenin, Engels and, you know, the Marx himself, supports voting for Joe Biden in the Democratic Party in the 2020 US election.  It's very clear that in this video, Vorsch began with an answer in mind already, yes they would and then ignored contradictory evidence and over or misinterpreted much of what he did cite.  I will explain both why he is wrong and why I'm not being more charitable and simply assuming that he made some honest mistakes.  I will also later go into more subjective territory and explain why I think that Vaush and others like him are going to bet far too much for Biden, even outright lying to do so, despite their insistence that they don't actually like him or the Democratic Party establishment.  To clarify before you get all mad, I am not personally against voting for Joe Biden.  I am also not someone who just dogmatically follows the word of old Marxist white guys.  I am, however, strongly against just lying and whitewashing in service of the Democratic Party.  Firstly, Vaush addresses arguments against not voting at all.  I'm not too sure why he thinks this was needed, perhaps he encountered people saying as such, but those people clearly are not familiar with Marxist theory.  Aside from some very weird Maoists, anarchists are actually the ones who are more likely to advocate against voting.  There is a difference between electoralism, the belief that simple electoral participation should effectively be the extent of our politics, and electoral participation itself.  Regardless, look, I'm just gonna get to the point of this video right away.  Vaush takes a bunch of Engels and Marx quotes out of context of their wider views on the subject.  For example, Vaush notes that Marx believed that in certain contexts, socialism may be achievable through elections. ",

That being the case, we must also recognize the fact that in most countries on the continent, the lever of our revolution must be force.  It is force to which we must one day appeal in order to erect the rule of  labor.\" ",

            "text": "But with context, it's clear that Marx and Engels believe that socialism achieved democratically would come from an independent workers' party, not from subservience to a bourgeois party that explicitly serves bourgeoisie interests, like the Democratic Party in the US.  Most damning is Marx's address to the Communist League in 1850.  Even when there is no prospect whatsoever of their being elected, the workers must put up their own candidates in order to preserve their independence, to count their forces, and to bring before the public their revolutionary attitude and party standpoint.  In this connection, they must not allow themselves to be seduced by such arguments of the Democrats.  Wink wink, nudge nudge.  For example, that by doing so they are splitting the democratic party wink wink nudge nudge and making it possible for the reactionaries to win.  the ultimate intent of all such phrases is to dupe the proletariat.  marx is clear that an independent workers party should be formed and backed even if it splits the vote.  now you could argue that this was in a different context.  marx there was talking about a post-revolutionary parliament like the one that formed after the russian revolution but engels writing in eighteen eighty six after marx's death when their thought on this subject was pretty much at its final stage wrote specifically about the american context and echoed the statements that marx had made thirty-six years earlier in a country that has newly entered the movement.  the first really crucial step is the formation by the workers of an independent political party no matter how so long as it is distinguishable as a labour party.  and this step has been taken far sooner than we might expect.  and that's the main thing that the first program of this party should still be muddle-headed and extremely inadequate that it should have picked henry george for its figurehead are unavoidable if merely transitory evils.  the masses must have time and opportunity to evolve and they will not get that opportunity unless they have a movement of their own no matter what its form providing it is their own movement in which they are impelled onwards by their own mistakes and learned by bitter experience.  again run in elections yes but with an independent workers party, which he describes as the first really crucial step.  He was against puritanism in the workers movement, but he most certainly did not advocate for working within bourgeoisie liberal parties.  The only possible conclusion to be drawn from these two passages is that Marx and Engels thought that independent workers parties of some description should always run in elections, even if they will lose, and even if they will split the vote.  These two passages alone are absolutely damning for Walsh's argument.  He quotes so widely that I find it difficult to believe that he wasn't aware of these quotes.  Surely he came across them in his research. ",

A huge part of his thesis is that the writings of Marx and Engels support voting for Biden.  They clearly do not.  So yeah, kind of wrong already.  I'll go on anyway, though.  Foch later moves on to quoting Lenin to support the idea of socialists working within the US Democratic Party.  He references a very long series of quotes, and in every single one of them, Lenin is advocating to work within the UK Labour Party to further communist goals.  The UK Labour Party, while bourgeois-led, had an overwhelmingly proletarian base, and I would argue that it was more left-wing, than really any major electoral party in the world today.  Arguably, you could even say that this Labor Party was a workers' party in the sense that Marx and Engels used the term Especially since, in what I just quoted Engels used Labor Party as a synonym for workers' party.  There is certainly no comparison between them and the Democratic Party.  Vaush actually acknowledges this early in the video and again later.  Great.  But he then goes on to ignore that fact and interpret Lenin in an incredibly dishonest way to support his preconceived conclusions.  So he knew about this context, but chose not to factor it into his interpretations.  Because otherwise, well, these quotes don't support his argument.  Here's a couple of examples. ",

Therefore, British communists should affiliate their party to the Labour Party and come to arrangements with it for the formation of a joint parliamentary bloc and the mutual sharing out of constituencies.  So in this segment right here, Lenin is saying that the failure of the Labour Party and the failure of reformism would be a form of radicalization for the proletariat.  It would provide the proletariat an opportunity to witness the failings of the predominant left-leaning party at that time. ",

The party apparatus itself ensures that these proposals never get to the floor, as they have for decades, so radicalisation in the way that Lenin described it will not happen here.  A situation like this where the workers are practically completely unrepresented in formal politics cannot be compared to that of which Lenin spoke, where workers reforms will be proposed in parliament with strong backing from a major labour party.  The USA does not have such a party because of arguments against vote splitting and for working within the democratic party, as Vaush is advocating for. ",

You today represent the opinions of the majority of British workers, and we know that, as yet we do not.  Therefore, we cannot at present take the power.  But you, who represent the opinions of the masses, you should take the power.  Lenin openly advocates for... Bending the knee to the Labour Party, because at the time he spoke of this to Sylvia Pankhurst, following the Second Congress of the Communist Internationale, the Labour Party was far more representative of the interests of the proletariat than the communists were at the time.  He did this because he understood that a conciliatory gesture now would bring him a better opportunity to infiltrate the party and radicalize people from within the party in the future. ",

Since the communists cannot enter upon the decisive struggle between themselves and the bourgeoisie until the bourgeoisie is in power, It follows that it is in the interest of the communists to help the bourgeoisie to power as soon as possible in order the sooner to be able to overthrow it.  Against the governments, therefore, the communists must continually support the radical liberal party, taking care to avoid the self-deceptions of the bourgeoisie and not fall for the enticing promises of benefits which a victory for the bourgeoisie would allegedly bring the proletariat.  The sole advantages which the proletariat would derive from a bourgeoisie victory would consist in, one, In various concessions which would facilitate the unification of the proletariat into a close-knit, battle-worthy, and organized class.

This is a necessary historical development to bring about bourgeois capitalist democracy and the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie that will eventually bring about communism.  I have absolutely no idea how he's applying this to an election between two bourgeois parties in a bourgeois capitalist democratic system to advocate voting for one of those bourgeois parties.  There is simply no relation.  The USA and most of the world today is far far beyond the relevant stage of historical development.  He also does the same with a completely irrelevant mail quote.  Now look, there's more to Vaush's video than this.  A lot more leaps and misinterpretations.  I'm not going to spend a week working on a real video to deal with them all.  I'm literally making this in my pyjamas just because I can't sleep, basically just reading off a comment that I left on his video, and I have a dentist appointment for this in two hours.  Great.  I do not claim to know if Marx, Engels, Lenin, etc.  would or would not vote for Joe Biden.  Perhaps when given the context, they would, after vomiting at the present state of the world, advocate for a very reluctant, strategic vote just this once.  But the thing is, you can't actually infer that from what they wrote at all.  And Vaush is arguing for even more than that.  If anything, the opposite is much more evident in their theory.  They definitely would not advocate for working within a bourgeois centre-right party like the Democrats.  Does that mean that you should just blindly do what their writings infer and not vote?  No.  But Vaush's video claims that their writings support his position.  They don't.  In the lead up to this election, people are just blatantly lying.  Not just about this, but other things too, in service of the Democratic Party.  And pretending that any of this stuff shows that Marxist theorists would vote for Joe Biden too, is a great example of that.  A portion of us certainly do say that they're using electoral politics for radicalization, and that deep down they're against the Democratic Party and candidates like Joe Biden in the long run.  But the way they're so willing to just plainly lie in service of them, even whitewash them at times, shows that they are taking the notion that you should reluctantly vote for Joe Biden way too far.  The effect of this in the long run, and I at least am already seeing this, is going to be you and the people you influence internalizing these falsehoods, believing that the Democratic Party is better than it actually is, and ending up working within it.  then being consumed not just by electoralism, but also by the party machine.  Call yourself radical all you want.  Tell us that you have more radical positions deep down than the Democratic Party does.  But as long as they're still getting your vote, as long as you're not actively trying to form alternatives to their party, including in the electoral system, they don't care.  You need a real strategy in the long run that goes beyond them.  They want you to avoid building a genuinely independent workers party.  They want you to believe that the two-party system cannot and should not be challenged, so that you continue to work within the party and are consumed by it, as millions of others have been.  You saw this happen in 2016, and it just happened again months ago.  And as a final outside, please, let's focus on totally owning your opponents.  more on honestly engaging with the actual ideas without preconceived conclusions.  I can make an argument for basically anything and make it sound really convincing with lots of citations, lots of, you know, really fancy-looking formal academic citations from lots of big-name thinkers.  I can deliver it while sounding very confident in my righteousness and easily convince the vast majority of people who view it, even while knowing perfectly well that I am totally wrong and leaving huge things out.
