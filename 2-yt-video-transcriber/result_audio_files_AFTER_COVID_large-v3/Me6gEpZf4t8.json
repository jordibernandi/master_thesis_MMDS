So Dave Rubin, someone I actually used to work with, someone who I actually used to be close with, apparently had some sort of political awakening.  At least that's the way he describes it.  where all of a sudden he doesn't believe in anything he used to believe and likes to rub shoulders with all sorts of right-wingers.  So he's coming out with a new book and he's promoting it on various shows, including on Adam Carolla's program.  And in a recent interview, Dave Rubin decided to specifically go after Bernie Sanders, progressive members of Congress, and question their intelligence and literacy when it comes to the economy.  Let's take a quick look. ",

And it's like, well, I guess, you know, Bernie just made up a number, so now she made up a number and her number's higher, so she must be more moral.  And that sort of race to outdo each other, to pretend that you know what you're doing, in the name of doing good, well, it leads to all sorts of horrific policies and all sorts of stuff.  I mean, when they say they're for free college, well, first off, we know nothing is free.

He accused Bernie Sanders of pretending to know what you're doing.  Pretending to know what you're doing.  Now, we all know Rubin is a grifter.  When he pivoted toward right wing politics, he had some pretty significant financial backers.  Koch brothers were involved.  Dennis Prager was involved.  And like, you know, they were buttering his bread and he decided like this is where the money is.  I'm going to go ahead and start spouting right wing talking points.  But you do have to do some legwork in politics.  being a grifter.  You need to study the talking points.  You need to know or at least expect what the counter argument is.  And you need to be at least somewhat savvy.  And there are grifters on the right who do a decent job at this.  They're a little more sophisticated.  Dave Rubin's not one of those people.
