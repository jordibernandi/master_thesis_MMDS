            "text": "Welcome back.  You're here with Goldberg.  Today I'm going to be talking about conservatism and a lot of the problems associated with this idea.  I don't want to call it philosophy or ideology because I don't think it's either of those things.  In fact, most of the time I'm not sure what a conservative is or what conservatism is supposed to represent.  I talked about, you know, a couple years back the video Why I'm Not a Conservative.  And it was interesting.  A lot of the self-described conservatives were commenting.  They said, no, no, no, no, no.  You are a true conservative.  You're genuine.  You're not like the others.  You're not like those rhinos.  Look, if you find yourself constantly having to appeal to purity to defend something, you might have a problem with your point of view.  Perhaps it needs to be articulated better because so many people are taking advantage of you and frankly dragging your name through the mud.  I tried to explain this and I think I brought up in that video, this is a head of a pretty prominent conservative organizations.  And I said to him, the mistake you guys make is you always operate on the paradigms of the far left.  So if they call you a racist, you spend days, months, weeks, you publish books, documentaries, proving how you're not a racist.  And they are, if they say you're homophobic, you prove that you're not homophobic.  You're never really going for the jugular and advancing anything.  What I describe a conservative as is essentially a reluctant liberal.  You know, you're one or two election cycles behind the Democrats or the far left at any given time.  A conservative is the smug, condescending person who wants to sit in the velvet-floored library or reading room with a glass of brandy and a cigar saying, as Rome is burning, ha-ha, you should have listened to me.  But, of course, he didn't do anything to really prevent the problem.  In fact, in a lot of respects, he encourages it.  He furthers the issue because he defends fundamentally broken ideas and principles.  That, I think, at the core is the problem with conservatism.  And if you look at the last 30 or 40 years, with some exceptions at the state level, conservatives have accomplished pretty much nothing.  Yeah, they've deregulated.  Yeah, they've cut taxes.  They've appointed judges that do whatever corporations want.  But what is the result?  In fact, it's funny.  Their guy had this great tweet, and he was saying, imagine fighting for the freedoms of corporations for 40 or 50 years, and they turn around and embrace every SJW cause and fire you if you happen to disagree.  That's ostensibly what conservatives have achieved in government and the federal level.  There's been no civil service reform.  There's been no substantial migration reform.  There's been no spending reform.  There's been no real limitation of government.  And yet they talk about they can't do anything whenever they have the adequate majorities where they could have actually worked if they put pressure to get rid of the filibuster.  It's never an issue because now they've got to move along with the whole, you know, advance the military and fighting terrorism at any cost.  So you see what the outcome of that happens to be.  And they'll say, oh yeah, but we did the First Step Act.  Do you really think that those people protesting care that the Republicans pushed for prison reform or that the president did?  No, in fact, they're trying to blame him for something he had no part in.  And like they blame him for everything else.  You know, the fact of the matter is to the far left, all right, your usefulness is quite irrelevant if you happen to be a right wing this, that, or the other.  And we'll go into that in just a second here because I think it's quite important.  Now, of course, what are the conservatives doing?  Pushing police reform.  So what happened to localism and states' rights and respecting the fact that different jurisdictions have varied demographics, income levels?  maybe the right to have their own destiny, and now the Republicans, the conservatives, are pushing for federal oversight, federal rules, laws, more regulation on people because they want to prove, by the way, by the way, we're also not racist.  I mean, it's so pathetic.  It goes against everything they claim to stand for because they're so afraid.  Conservatives are more afraid, honestly, of being labeled a racist than, I think, dying, genuinely speaking.  I think that's absolutely the case.  In terms of the observation of principles in the face of gross destruction and significant problems, it's interesting.  Rich Lowry comes out with an article and basically his concern with Trump is again tweeting.  This is 2020.  We're talking about Trump tweeting again.  That's his issue, that he's not dignifying the office of the presidency.  Oh, okay.  Oh, sure, right?  I was just recently talking to a guy, nice dude, okay, about my age, a big-time conservative cuck, you know, the type that's always trying to grovel and prove, I'm not like the other people.  And he was so outraged.  He was so bothered by the fact that Trump used his personal methane gas on the protesters in D.C.  so he could go to church.  And he said, that is unacceptable.  He violated their right to peaceably assemble.  And I was like, I didn't actually laugh at him.  I'm a little bit more polite than that, but maybe I should have.  It's like you are more concerned about the rights of the protesters, about essentially defending the system, despite the fact that the people you're going up against don't care and are willing to burn the system as they're proving that.  to essentially show what their point of view happens to be.  And you're still fixated on it.  It reminds me of John Roberts, when they had the whole census question of the Supreme Court.  Yeah, you're allowed to do it, but you didn't do it the right way.  So as this country is struggling with a sense of identity, we have so many problems.  The Chief Justice is concerned about procedure.  That is his great legacy unto the country, procedure, like with the Obamacare being a tax.  At what point are conservatives going to have any kahunas and say, this is ridiculous and it needs to end?  Just, you know, just offering up the question, I suppose.  And again, who cares about these principles if your country is falling apart and the other side is, you know, having a dumpster fire with those principles?  They're so fixated as though, like, at least I'll die being right.  At least I'll die not being a racist.  At least I'll die supporting the Constitution.  It's like, you don't realize that you're losing the country and that's going to affect your kids as well.  You don't seem to care because... principles and decency.  Like someone else said on Twitter, I said, you know, let's say BLM destroys the Washington Monument.  and the conservatives respond, that's not how you win a debate.  You need facts and logic.  That's just kind of funny, but also not funny.  And then this whole thing with the military.  Mark Milley apologizing, Mattis coming out, you know, oh yeah, Mattis, this is what my friend was saying, he wanted Mattis as president, or John McCain if they could bring him back.  And I say, no.  You see, whether you want to call these generals liberals or conservative, I think also Petraeus was whining, when you get to the level of like a four-star general, you don't exactly get there by being, you know, fighting the system, fighting the regime.  You get there by being a good bureaucratic political player.  You take Petraeus in particular.  He has a PhD plus he became a general.  Do you really think that's someone who's bucking the system?  No.  That's the reason why most of the time when there is an uprising in a country, let's say the Middle Eastern countries, this is very common, It was typically a colonel or below who was leading that, not a general, because the general's got his nice salary, his position, his pension.  He doesn't want to rock the boat.  So, of course, he's going to oppose anything which could threaten the system.  In the case of Milley, he's like, oh, it seemed like the military was getting involved in domestic affairs.  Right.  The military can't step in to restore order.  because it violates the principles of the people who are burning the entire system down.  Correct.  All right, that makes a lot of sense.  Thank you for these great military leaders.  Again, this is the problem with people who support anything blindly because it has stars and stripes or a uniform or whatnot.  You've got to realize there are problems, and you've got to be willing to have a realist approach to solving that issue.  Then we have, of course, Mitt Romney coming out to march Black Lives Matter.  Now, it's interesting because if Mitt Romney had become president in 2008 or, hell, even maybe 2012, he would still be sending black people, amongst others, to die in the Middle East in the interests of a certain country or countries.  I won't go into that.  But he's also supporting Black Lives Matter.  So these conservatives who have no problem post-9-11, Patriot Act, Real  I.D.,  all these DHS appropriations, military industrial complex, they have no issue increasing surveillance, taking away your freedom, starting wars.  that, frankly, do you really think the average Iraqi or Afghan civilian, their lives matter?  You know, honestly, do you think so as far as these neocons are concerned?  No.  But all the neocon sacks of excrement that have come out of the Republican Party are now all outraged about the response to the protests.  It's quite ludicrous in a bad way, but it's nonetheless there.  So you can pass all this draconian legislation, but we can't use that to restore order on our own streets or to secure our own borders because that's offensive and looks bad politically because the left said so.  Like if Romney, honestly, if the left was telling Romney that we need to protect businesses, Romney would be like, oh yeah, business lives matter, buildings matter too.  Because Romney is the epitome of a political snake.  For whatever he might be as an individual, as a family man, I don't know.  But as a politician, he's easily one of the greatest turncoats, least principled people.  in the history of American politics.  And this goes back many years, like when he was running against Teddy Kennedy.  So I have no interest in hearing anything more from Mitt the Banana Romney personally.  Now, how do you explain it?  Do you say it's weak men?  Do you think it's feminism?  Do you think it's maybe consumer capitalist Christianity where you have to never say anything judgmental, never take a firm position?  I don't really know, but I'm saying this is the reason I don't consider myself a conservative because I look around and I'm like, what is being a conservative about?  It's basically sitting there waiting until the leftist position is outdated so you can feel better about supporting what they were in favor of, you know, 10 or 20 years ago.  It's not particularly enticing from my perspective. ",
