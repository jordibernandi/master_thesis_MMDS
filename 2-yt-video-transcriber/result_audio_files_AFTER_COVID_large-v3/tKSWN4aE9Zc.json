Hi, Lori Croft.  Sassy assassin.  So I wanted to show you guys the DMV, my local DMV.  Right now, they're accepting appointments only.  So you're not able to walk in this building without an appointment.  So where do you guys want to go?  You let me know.  All right, let's go for a little walk, guys.  Let me show you guys the neighborhood over here.  I'm actually taking a family member, I dropped them off already, to the DMV, so that's what brings me here.  I wasn't really planning on coming back here after our endeavor yesterday with American Amy and James Madison audits.  Let me turn the camera around for a second.  Rights trump feelings.  Yes, they sure do.  Thank you, Terry.  And this is where we're at again, guys.  All right. ",

Oh, I guess I'll wait for the cops.  I don't want them to be looking for me.  I think their appointment is over.  I don't know why they just don't go home.  I wasn't even filming them.  I don't know why they started with me, guys.  What would you categorize this couple as?  They called me a terrorist and they said I have a backpack on my back.  What would you call these people?  I know I really, I'm really restraining myself because I don't want them to say that I'm being disorderly. ",
