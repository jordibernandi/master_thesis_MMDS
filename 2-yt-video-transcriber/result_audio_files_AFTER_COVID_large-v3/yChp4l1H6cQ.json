With lies and fake accounts, some of us sat out the election just like they wanted.  Not this time.  Three things to know.  One, sometimes good people have bad information.  That crazy meme your uncle sent with the conspiracy theory about COVID or Kamala?  It might have come from Moscow.  No joke.  What you can do.  Fact check the family chat, but do it with love.  Two, not all fights are fair or even real.  Because that Twitter beef about Biden's Democratic plantation with spicy Black King 411 might not even be real.
