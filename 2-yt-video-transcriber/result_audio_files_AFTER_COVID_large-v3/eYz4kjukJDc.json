            "text": "So this is something interesting to consider.  Johnny Depp may well be in Sherlock Holmes Part 3 because of Robert Downey Jr.  Now that headline in and of itself is fascinating, but what's more fascinating is this, a headline that came up a few days ago from an outlet called We Got This Covered.  See, they were talking about Johnny Depp reportedly reaching out and begging Robert Downey Jr.  for a new job in Hollywood, and then this news, it started circulating elsewhere.  Now, something that I find fascinating and that I have a theory about is the fact that Warner Brothers owns that movie.  They own Sherlock Holmes 3, and they also own another movie out there.  What's that movie called?  Oh, yeah, Aquaman 2.  They own the movie that they keep a certain person firmly planted in and that people have not been happy about in the least.  Makes you wonder about a few things, doesn't it?  And we'll talk about those.  By the way, did you know that Warner Brothers also owns TMZ.  You know that outlet that only put out a minute and 34 seconds of a two minute and four second Johnny Depp video in which they went to bat for four years for A.H.  only for you to find out, yeah, context not included.  Hmm, it sounds like someone that has been trying to remove another person's career may have well missed the mark.  So hey there, now over the last few weeks, we've been covering the twists and turns that have been transpiring in a courtroom happening between one Johnny Depp and either associates of A.H.  or A.H.  themselves.  Now to hear A.H.  tell it, all of those accusations and all of that innuendo, Well, really, it's all aimed at her.  It's all meant to end her relationships with Aquaman and L'Oreal.  But anyone with, say, 20 minutes on their hands and a few brain cells, yeah, they know it's the other way around.  This stuff, it was supposed to stop Johnny Depp from working.  Now, granted, you and I, we have no idea the extent of damage that was done to Johnny Depp's career.  But I will say this.  We do know that there was damage.  How do we know that?  Well, we can look at Pirates of the Caribbean.  We can see how they sidestepped him despite all of the money that they've made over the years.  And I've got an insider that talks about this with Disney.  They have some interesting things to say, too.  The more salacious gossip comes up, too, talking about people like Leonardo DiCaprio trying to ban Johnny Depp from Hollywood after everything that's transpired.  And even if those things aren't true, one thing is abundantly clear.  Johnny Depp, he needs work.  He needs people on his side of things.  And for the longest time, it looked like he didn't have them.  That's why this series of events with Robert Downey Jr.  is not only interesting, but incredibly important.  Because if a person like Johnny Depp, if his level of stardom can be canceled by accusation and innuendo, then what chance does everyone else have out there?  I mean, seriously, what chance does a normal person have?  to combat this thing that we're seeing and we're seeing grow.  So a few days ago, all of this kicks off with an article from We Got This Covered.  It was entitled, Johnny Depp reportedly begging Robert Downey Jr.  for a job in Hollywood.  Now, I found this to be interesting because of the connotation to it.  And it did make me wonder about the damage done.  And it also made me wonder if Robert Downey Jr.  would go to bat for Johnny Depp.  Now, there were two items in this report that really made me think, yeah, this could actually be true.  Number one, the two people had been friends.  Robert Downey  Jr.,  Johnny Depp, they had been friends for decades, decades, dating back to when the two were up-and-coming Hollywood stars and notorious hell raisers.  And that's true.  I couldn't find anything that really indicated that these two had had some kind of falling out relationship.  Not to the degree where Robert Downey Jr.  wouldn't try to help out Johnny Depp.  Second, and very important in this, is Robert Downey Jr.  has also dealt with the Hollywood cancel culture scene as well, to the point that he was forced to pay penance.  He was forced to go out and apologize.  And really, what was he apologizing for?  Of course, Downey Jr.  knows what it feels like to hit rock bottom, with a series of, let's just say, substance-related arrests seemingly to have torpedoed his entire career before the success of his Marvel Cinematic Universe rocketed him to the very top of the A-list, so you can understand why he'd be more than happy to help out his longtime friend.  Yeah, a lot of people stood with him, including Johnny Depp, so why wouldn't he return the favor?  Now, one thing that I like about We Got This Covered is they cover all the basics as well.  They tell you why this stuff is happening, how recent revelations, they have taken public opinion, and they have swung it firmly in Johnny Depp's favor, and on.  Following his long-running, highly protracted, and very messy divorce from ex-wife A.H.  taking place in the public eye, though, Depp has seen his personal and professional relationship take a battering over the last few years.  And that is the understatement of the century.  It is like this guy has been hit by wave after wave of innuendo and speculation and has tried to bury him when he looks like the aggrieved party.  Not the aggressor, but the aggrieved.  Continuing, while recent revelations have had public opinion swing firmly in his favor, the 57-year-old was still dropped from the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, and despite rumors that he could be set for a return, Jack Sparrow hasn't been confirmed to be involved in either of the new movies that are in development, and fans are not happy about it.  That is also the understatement of the century.  Fans have been in uproar about it, and they definitely should be.  And there's a lot of uproar in Disney as well.  People are waiting for the outcome, what happens during these court trials.  Now, this article, it brings up something interesting, and it doesn't mean to here.  Outside of his personal troubles, with the exception of Pirates of the Caribbean's consistent box office success, Depp's star has also faded dramatically after a string of critical and commercial failures, and a new rumor claims that so few gigs are coming his way that he begged Downey Jr.  to help him out.  Now that, it actually makes a point about Disney not meaning to, canceling him even though he has had consistent box office success with Pirates of the Caribbean.  And this was updated as well to say, apparently the Iron Man star has responded in kind and now offered him a role in Sherlock Holmes 3.  Now there's a few things fascinating about this.  Number one, I had a source hit me up saying that they were connected with Warner Brothers talking about this fairy move.  And now you have outlets discussing this same thing.  Quote, a senior source at Warner Brothers, which has already set a UK release date up December 24th for Sherlock 3, confirmed, quote, Bob wants Johnny on board.  come hell or high water.  Now, something that really got me thinking about the relationship between Warner Brothers and another movie, like I mentioned at the beginning, was not a discussion about Warner Brothers, but rather a discussion about Disney.  Disney bosses have not invited Depp 57 to reprise his role as Captain Jack Sparrow in a planned new Pirates adventure.  The family-friendly entertainment giant is reportedly, quote-unquote, dismayed by shocking, and well, you can see all of the allegations, in the high court libel case.  It was alleged he was a, I know you know that, shrimp too, which Depp vehemently denies.  And then there was this part here.  Executives fear his reputation could take another pounding at the planned U.S.  hearing in January this during which he will again face ex-wife A.H.  over claims that she made in the Washington Post.  Now, I realize that that was supposed to make me think about the relationship between Depp and Disney, and I suppose it did a little bit, but really what it made me think about was the following.  Warner Brothers,  A.H.,  Warner Brothers also in Johnny Depp, and Warner Brothers in TMZ.  See, Warner Brothers actually owns TMZ, apparently.  I never thought about that.  And TMZ, well, they've released some interesting videos over the last few years.  And one of them recently turned out to be, well, let's just say, not completely accurate.  You can see this copyright claim I received over it made me think about that relationship.  And if people start thinking about the fact that they released 1 minute and 30 seconds of a video that was over 2 minutes, where they clip out a lot of stuff that really sets the scene, yeah, that might not be good for them.  Now, additionally, you have the problems with Aquaman 2, and I don't think Warner Bros.  really knows how to deal with that stuff.  See, Aquaman in 2018, it became one of just a couple of DC comic book related films to do well.  And this film, it did exceedingly well.  If you look at the money that it brought in, we're talking about a domestic box office of $335 million.  International box office of almost $809 million.  For a worldwide box office total of $1.143, almost $1.144 billion, with a B brought in.  That doesn't include any type of home market performance, anything else out there.  That's just what it made in its theatrical run.  So, on a budget of $160 million, they bring in... The problem is the landscape has changed, and Aquaman and Warner Bros.  are both being mentioned in court documents.  This is in counterclaims mentioned from  A.H.,  and let's look at this.  Since that time, Mr.  Depp has unlawfully targeted A.H.  in an ongoing harassment and online smear campaign in order to damage her reputationally and financially.  In particular, without limitation, Mr.  Depp has initiated, coordinated, overseen, and or supported... and amplified two Change.org petitions, one to remove A.H.  as an actress in an Aquaman movie franchise, and one to remove her as the spokesman for L'Oreal.  As early as 2016, Mr.  Depp admitted his attention to destroying her career, stating, for example, that he, quote-unquote, wanted her replaced on that WB or Warner Bros.  film, referencing the blockbuster hit Aquaman.  So you have Aquaman being brought up in that setting and being brought up by someone.  Well, let's just say they're not popular.  How not popular?  Well, if change.org is any indication of what exactly is transpiring, you have 482,000 followers.  168 signatures on something called Remove A.H.  from Aquaman 2.  This is just one petition out of many circulating, and that doesn't include all of the voices out there that won't sign off on something like this, but they will definitely go and bypass it because they want nothing to do with this person.  They want nothing to do with the damages that they wrought, and they want nothing to do with companies that back them.  Fascinating, isn't it, that a company that is backed A.H.  through and through would throw Johnny Depp his quote-unquote lifeline out there?  And fascinating as well that Johnny Depp could have stand-up friends and people like Robert Downey Jr.  and more.
