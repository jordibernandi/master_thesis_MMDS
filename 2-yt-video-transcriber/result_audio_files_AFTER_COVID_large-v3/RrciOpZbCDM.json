            "text": "Welcome everyone.  I have been receiving quite a few questions about water lately.  So I want to discuss this.  There are people who believe that the best water comes from a spring.  Some believe the best water comes from a well or underground source.  Some believe filtered water is the best.  Some say reverse osmosis.  Some say distilled.  Some say vortex.  The truth is nobody really knows for sure.  But We do know a few things about water that may help you make a decision about what type of purified water to consume.  You know, it's true that there are people who don't know just how vital water is for not only keeping you alive, but for maintaining dynamic health.  So I'm going to let you all in on the basics of everything that I know about restructuring your water, because good water matters.  So here we go, but let's go slow.  Water covers about 70% of the Earth's surface.  Over 95% of the Earth's water is in the oceans.  Then you have water in the air, ice caps, glaciers.  You have lakes, rivers, streams, creeks, aquifers, et cetera.  Then you have water in biological life forms, humans, plants, animals.  Now if you look at this chart you can see that the water percentage varies throughout the body.  But these numbers that you see are not precise.  The important thing to note about this chart is that certain parts of the body need water more than others.  Such as the vital organs need much more water than your bones.  And it's your body's job to distribute that water accordingly.  What everyone needs to know and understand is that not all water is equal.  For example, ocean water is of course different than lake water because ocean water is salt water and lake water is fresh water in that it doesn't have the same level of minerals in it.  But let's take a look at what exactly is in salt water from oceans.  As you can see, ocean water is over 80% sodium chloride or salt.  Over 7% is magnesium, then sulfur, which is around 4%, then calcium and a few other minerals.  Just about every mineral that is in the earth is in water.  Water is the universal solvent.  The levels of these minerals is so high that it is undrinkable.  It dehydrates you.  Because you're now throwing off the balance of your mineral to water ratio.  But it is not the salt alone that makes it bad.  It is because the energy of the ocean water is so high, your body wants that water bad.  Are you with me so far?  When your body wants or craves a certain nutrient, sometimes your body will take all the bad stuff with it.  Just so it can have a taste.  And I'm going to get into dead and alive water in a moment.  Now, lakes and rivers have the same minerals present, but at much, much lower levels.  Because the water is not as deep as ocean water.  The water that is in the pipes, in your pipes, for most of us, that water comes from a municipal source.  It's recycled, filtered, and chemically sterilized.  Your body hates that water.  It doesn't want it.  It doesn't even want to absorb it.  This is what you call dead water.  Now, why is the water dead?  Well, let me tell you.  I love the way Bruce Lee put it.  Even though this is out of context, he said, water can flow or it can crash.  When you have water that is just sitting around, doesn't matter where it's sitting or what it's sitting in.  it could be sitting in a bottle.  wherever the water is sitting it is still motionless water and it is therefore lacking in energy and therefore for the most part dead water.  there is actually a wetness to water.  some of that wetness has to do with the electron flow the movement of the water.  you see a river A stream, a waterfall, whirlpool, the ocean.  Wet.  All moving bodies of water with massive amounts of energy.  Everyone knows the unstoppable power of a lot of water.  Water that is just sitting there, however, is harmless.  And don't sit there and say, Oh, you can still drown in it.  That's not what I meant, silly.  Anyway, do you see?  So, Water that is moving is full of life, has a lot of electromagnetic energy.  And one of the reasons for that is because that water is flowing through and around the earth.  So that water actually picks up a type of electromagnetic charge.  It's also very well grounded at the same time.  You all know water is a great conductor of what?  Okay, so moving water is living water.  Still, stagnant water is dead water, like this puddle of standing water.  So, here we go.  If you don't drink tap water, you have a few choices here.  Water that is in or on the ground, water that is in the store, or water that falls out of the sky.  Now, the water that runs in wells, rivers, streams, lakes is filtered naturally by the earth, but You don't want to drink dirt, so you would still have to use your own filters before you could drink it.  Unless you are in some survival situation, then water off the surface of a stream or waterfall or spout, not a big deal.  I would stay away from rivers if possible.  The point is, that water is going to have something in it, most of which you cannot see, but as long as you can filter and boil it, you're good to go.  Rainwater should be filtered and tested if possible before drinking.  You have no idea what chemicals could be lurking in that water these days.  Especially with you-know-what trails being sprayed in the skies.  Now the problem with bottled water at the store is that it's bottled water in the store.  It's been sitting still for one thing so it has no energy really.  Second, it's mostly filtered water from a municipal source.  If it comes from a spring source, it's still filtered, but at least it's from a natural source.  Do you see?  So it's a bit better than other store-bought water, but it's still dead water.  Next, you have bottled electrolyte water and pH water now.  These are all scams, folks.  They add cheap particulates to that water.  In the guise of beneficial minerals.  Which should only.  Come from a plant source.  Not water.  Unless that water has been running.  Through nothing but plants.  You don't get your minerals from rocks.  Those minerals.  Have to.  Have to.  Be photosynthesized first.  Through a plant.  Then you get those minerals.  That your body can absorb.  Because all that other crap.  It's going in and out.  Unless your body decides it wants to store it in your fat cells.  Do you read me?  I don't know how many times I have to say this.  They don't care about your health.  pH water is another scam water.  That's it.  You're going to drink it too?  Man.  You know what you all need to do?  Go take a look at the water pH scale.  Oh, never mind.  It's right here.  See?  Look.  Now, what gives you the idea that you should be drinking alkaline water?  Look, neutral water is a seven, right?  You know what you have to add to neutral, pure water to make it as alkaline?  as store water with a pH above a nine?  Baking soda?  Soap?  You think they're sitting there making this alkaline water with fruits and vegetables?  So you folks can see All the issues surrounding our water supply.  So what do we do?  Okay, so in-home distillation and filtration.  Let me tell you what I do at home, and I'll explain as I go.  Keep in mind, there are dozens of methods used.  I just want to keep it very basic for this presentation.  My source of water is going to be a municipal supply because that's what most of us are working with when it comes to free water.  I take the water from the tap and it goes in a sealed stainless steel kettle.  Actually, they used to use wooden barrels back in the day, but this is conventional.  Now, it's not like a pressure cooker because there is an outlet for steam.  A metal tubing is connected to the kettle for steam to travel through.  That tube then passes through cold water to cool the steam and convert it back into a liquid.  without the dissolved particles that's in the tap water.  now you have distilled water but some things that are in tap water turn into gases just like the water does so.  now the distilled water is put through a filter usually carbon but you can use something like a zero water filter which I use which does actually remove almost all dissolved particles down to zero or reverse osmosis filter.  what have you now?  after that?  you should have pure H2O but the water is still dead water especially after distillation.  so we want to charge the water back up electrically and we want to get it moving again.  so what we can use and what I use is a magnetic stirring plate.  you take your distilled filtered water and you place it in your vessel.  The magnet charges the water and the magnetic plate comes with a small pill-shaped magnet that spins the water into a vortex.  Thus, the vortex that is created pulls in that magnetic energy that you want, bringing the water back to life.  Now you have water that has basically gone through the process that natural water goes through here on the earth.  Do you see?  The benefits of which are mind-blowing.  Your body becomes hydrated more than it ever has.  Organs rejuvenate.  You can think clearer, better.  You feel more mobile.  You have more energy.  There's less inflammation.  You sleep better.  Your digestion is better.  Less gas, bloating, and flatulence.  It clears up your skin.  Did I mention it hydrates you?  Not that fake hydration you get from bottled water.  I'm talking cellular hydration.  Anyway, I just wanted to go over the basics of water purification, and I'm sure that now you have a much better understanding of that than before.  And I didn't even get into the mechanics and chemistry of it, like how vortex water realigns the atomic structure.  It changes how the water affects the body.  No worries, folks.  We will be discussing this further.  I just wanted to get you all thinking.  And I will have resources for more information on water up on woodwardentertainment.com.  so go look for that up on the site soon.  there's more headed your way very soon.  everyone.  please be sure to visit woodwardentertainment.com.  i am running a very special discount on a certain item that i cannot mention here on youtube but it's labor day weekend and i wanted to make sure everyone had the opportunity to take advantage of those savings.
