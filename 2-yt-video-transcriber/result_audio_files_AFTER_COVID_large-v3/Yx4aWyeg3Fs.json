            "text": "Today we are in the fourth day of praying for the spinning plates.  You remember the dream where there were four liberals spinning plates, blue plates, laughing and mocking, ready to serve America a blue plate special.  But in the dream, they were looking for a sharpshooter who would actually shoot those four spinning plates.  And they had fallen to the ground.  And in the dream, I'm not boasting, it's just what the dream was by this dear brother Clay Nash.  And in the dream, Lou Engle and I believe it's all of us in intercession joining together with very clear, focused intercession to shoot.  We shot those plates.  The first one was Georgia.  The blue plate was hit, fell to the ground, and it became the red state of Georgia.  Oh, we need to keep praying for Georgia right now.  That God would strike Georgia.  the spinning plates, he would expose the spinners and the spinning plates, the false, the fraud, and expose what's behind the election dimensions seeking to bring forth untruth In Jesus' name, the second state was the state of North Carolina.  The third state was Pennsylvania, which we've covered over the last three days.  And the final state is Arizona.  We're striking that state of Arizona.  Would you join me in prayer?  Lord, we just say, God, where the plates are spinning, where there is secret deals behind the scene, God, machines, dominion machines that... are spouting out lies, where there has been unseen spinning of truth.  Lord, today we say, God, we shoot those spinning plates and we strike them in the name of Jesus.  Expose, expose, expose.  We call forth the falling of those blue states over arizona those blue plates and we release the red state of arizona even in the last moment where there seems no hope.  in the name of jesus we lift up these four states georgia north carolina pennsylvania and arizona.  we say living god.  We strike and sharpshoot those four states, expose, expose, expose, and we loose the revelation of the red state of Georgia, of the red state of North Carolina, of the red state of Pennsylvania, and the red state, Lord, of Arizona.  And even now with the battle that's going on over Michigan, we said break and shatter the blue states, the blue plate spinnings in Jesus' name over Wayne County in the name of Jesus.  Expose God.  Rise up and rule in righteousness over those who have made schemes of darkness.  who throw lies in the secret places in the name of Jesus, over the false voting machines, over Wisconsin, in the name of Jesus.  We say, let it fall in Jesus' name, Wisconsin.  Let the spinning plates be exposed.  Fall in the name of Jesus.  The blue state becomes the red state of Wisconsin.  Lord, we take our stand, God.  Lord, we want righteousness in these elections, Lord.  And so do you.  You're the God who stands for truth.  Oh, God, let God arise.  Let his enemies be scattered.  Scatter your enemies.  Expose, expose, expose.  For the sake of the unborn, my God.  for the sake of the unborn, for the sake, God, of Israel.  Arise, O God.  Scatter your enemies.  Expose, expose, expose.  In the name of Jesus, we pray.  Amen. ",
