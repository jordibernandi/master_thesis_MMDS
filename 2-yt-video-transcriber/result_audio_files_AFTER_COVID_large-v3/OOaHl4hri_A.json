            "text": "I am being threatened by Graham Linehan.  I explain why.  what Graham is fighting for, all intent aside, is effectively child torture using charity and peer-reviewed sources.  The video is now published below.  I mean, seriously.  Linehun has more than 608,000 followers compared to my 3,000.  So how on earth did this tweet of his get ratioed so badly compared to my response?  It was all over before Linehun could even realise what had happened.  You are already dead.  What?  You are already dead!  So yeah, for those of you who don't know, in the lead up to publishing my Wonderfully Evidenced video, Graham Linehan Rolls Out Plans to Eradicate Trans Children, I received a legal threat by none other than the bigot himself.  Turns out Linehan had been tagged in a retweet of my Patreon promotion which shared the video thumbnail and title, the person who did so suggesting that Linehan target my income.  And whilst Linehan had never even seen the video and the evidence contained, he decided to try and force me to take the post down mere hours before scheduled release.  So rather naturally, I went ahead and published on schedule before putting out the message that he was threatening me, the result of which was glorious.  Linehan very quickly discovered that I am immune to his threats of legal action.  I've been an online commentator for 11 years now.  I've been threatened by religious fascists and child predators, so this sort of threat is nothing new.  I've been here before, and every time, it has failed.  My wife and editor is a former practising lawyer who has become intimately knowledgeable on UK defamation law these past six months.  something that's important since, unlike places such as the US, both the UK and the Republic of Ireland place the onus of demonstrating the veracity of the original statement on the defendant.  So that is the base standard my videos adhere to.  I can very easily demonstrate due diligence carried out on behalf of my statements using evidence, because that was the focus of my video.  So Linehan really has no case no matter which court of law he attempts to pursue this in, though he could try to waste my time and resources, as slap suits are mostly intended to do.  Thankfully, if recent events have shown me anything, it's that I have a dedicated wife, circle of friends, and viewers willing to help me fight this.  Now, I'm not alone in this.  Pinknews has also been targeted by Linehan and has since removed their article reporting on his actions.  Whether this was done following them receiving a letter from Linehan's lawyer, or simply to avoid the issue altogether, is unknown to me at the time.  but I'm preparing for the worst.  Now since then I've gone ahead and started making plans for a fundraising campaign, which I'll put at the top of the video description as well as release a future video on when it's done.  We're still trying to gauge costs, but we're preparing for the worst.  So please, subscribe, like our Facebook, and follow on Twitter to stay up to date on that if you'd like to help.  By the way, the Pink News article was incredibly tame.  Titled, Graham Linehan is compiling a horrifying database of therapists with stark conversion therapy undertones, the article refused to come out and label Linehan's actions for what they were.  merely reporting on what others, such as journalist Katie Montgomery, have said on the matter.  I'd just like to add, before anyone claims the reporting of the article to be entirely one-sided, they did attempt to contact Linehan for the story, but he seemingly refused to defend his actions, instead waiting until the article had been published before posting to Twitter.

            "text": "right before Linehan would go on to start throwing his weight around.  Fact is, after I'd uploaded my response to Linehan's bullshit, I came across an article by Raoul Wilde published on the Friendly Atheist Pathias blog and shared by editor Hemant Mehta.  And in the article, which again is rather reserved, they mention Linehan's threats of legal action and how they've kept reporting the indiscretion facts of the situation.  Shortly after Hemant shared the article, Linehan came forward and told him that, Now Hemant asked to know what exactly Linehan believed to be defamation.  and receive no reply from him.  So currently the article remains up, unedited, as it should.  Now I want you to go ahead and read both articles as they're rather short, yet they both share a common trait.  Compared to my work, both articles are relatively reserved in what they say.  The Pink News article kept to what Linna himself had said and how others were responding to it, Meanwhile, whilst Rao's article on the Friendly Atheist was a little more upfront with her own feelings, they didn't come anywhere near my level of open scorn.  I not only note the fact that gender critical is simply a euphemism for transphobic in the same way that race realism is for racism, I not only point out the fact that all attempts to change a trans person's gender are harmful, I go so far as to correctly label said act as torture, and therefore child abuse.  But even these articles that do no such thing, that simply report on what Linehan had said and how others responded, those articles, in Linehan's eyes, must be silenced.  Why?  Well, most people are intelligent enough to put two and two together.  They see what Linehan is attempting to do.  something he'd much rather keep out of the scrutiny of the general public.  He's fine with his Twitter followers seeing it because he's spent years cultivating an audience that is hostile, if not apathetic, to the harm he calls as a trans community.  But the moment larger scrutiny is turned towards his actions, That seems to scare him.  And you know what?  It should.  It should scare him.  It should scare him in the exact same way that misogynists should be scared of their sexism being called out.  That homophobes should be scared of their homophobia being called out.  both of which, by the way, are things Graham Linehan also partakes in, as can be seen in his attempted policing of cis lesbian.  Linda Riley, publisher of Diva Magazine, which is Europe's leading magazine for lesbians and bisexual women, going so far as to question her lesbianship and erase the sexual identities of Diva Magazine's readership.  Graham Linehan talks a lot of shit about how he's a feminist, all the while doing everything he can to belittle and silence women who refuse to accept his bigotry, both cisgender and trans.  I mean, seriously.  What the fuck, Graham?  Mona was covering the 2011 protests in Egypt when riot police sexually assaulted her and broke both of her arms, and yet she still fights for justice.  She practically led the Mosque MeToo movement in 2018, only for you to come along and threaten her with legal action because, in her expert opinion, your actions are dangerous, yet you still claim to be speaking for women.  The women have spoken for themselves.  Linehan also recently went on to write an article for the Daily Fail, a paper that can at best be described as such. ",

The daily fail is fascist, and as a result, it's routinely misogynistic, unbasterly homophobic, and therefore makes Linehan feel right at home.  You see, I think I finally got to the core of why Linehan is the way he is.  And do note, this is just my opinion based on what I observed in regards to his actions.  Linehan is just a run-of-the-mill misogynist, only he's somewhat smart enough to realise that even his few remaining supporters likely wouldn't support outwardly misogynistic displays.  Therefore, he sets his sights on a marginalised sub-demographic of women, one he's less likely to be called out on for abusing, and for that he's chosen trans women and the many women who vocally support him.  is an outlet, a reprieve for his bigotry.

            "text": "Again, this is a paper which, among many other things, Linehan has accused of sexualising children.  And though the daily fail has only got worse as the years have progressed, Graham Linehan is now all too happy to cosy up with said fascist child groomers.  Why?  Well, to protect the little girls.  Somehow.  Something I will come around to cover in a future video.  But for now, I think that's enough said on that.  Though for someone who likes to pretend that there's some sort of transgender cabal out there, throwing around money to silence critics such as himself, I do hope Linehan comes to realise his projection on this.  To throw around the threat of lawsuit when people accurately report on your actions is a genuine attempt to stifle free speech.  Linehan has no case and he knows it.  He's merely doing this as an attempt to intimidate his critics into silence.  And it just won't work, not simply because I have a case, but because he's done the exact same thing without said evidence.  Linehan has, on multiple occasions, accused people of supporting conversion therapy because they support trans rights.  erasing the existence of gay and bisexual trans people such as myself.  And this is something Linhun does with zero basis.  Whilst I am able to show precisely how what he is fighting for is harmful and destructive, he can't do that with affirmative care.  The only peer-reviewed sources that touch the subject show that gender affirmation reduces levels of depression and anxiety in trans teens to levels equal to those seen in a cis control.  That is, it reduces it to levels seen in the general population.  It is the only ethical course of action.  That's what the science tells us, the work of countless people across various scientific disciplines.  And yet Linehan doesn't care to face the truth.
