            "text": "gentlemen excellent to be back with you on make town money today's topic how to make money when there's blood in the streets.  before i get into that you know what.  thank you to the ongoing support from the patreon supporters of this channel.  thank you kyle the newest member of patreon supporters of this channel as well as thank you guys that bought me a cup of coffee via paypal and bitcoin based upon the last videos.  men see the video description today of today's video.  become a supporter of this channel now before i get into making uh money in terms of today's markets.  let me give you a quick book recommendation for those of you guys who are looking to start a business a very unique novel a fictional book that i'm reading.  I bought a guy who started a business, and this is very, very clever and interesting.  The book's title is Drug Lord.  Two words, Drug Lord.  Men, see the video description today for the book, and I really think you will enjoy it.  It'll get your mind thinking.  Let's just say that.  All right, on to today's topic, how to make money when there's blood in the streets.  Gentlemen, I don't know about you, but frankly... I'm kind of hurting here.  As a matter of fact, I think I'm bleeding from an orifice on my backside.  In other words, I have lost personally thousands, well, let's just say tens of thousands of dollars, not just on paper, but actual money loss due to not just, of course, market turmoil over the past week to 10 days, but also because of some business interest I'm involved in.  Yeah, I'm hurting here.  My point is not to discuss what's going on currently with the coronavirus and not what's going on with the incredible volatility in the market.  We have not seen volatility like this in the past 10 plus years.  since about 2008, 2009.  And by the way, before I get into how you're going to make money from it, let me just quickly throw out a couple of comments regarding the virus.  One, there's probably a 50-50 chance that you are going to get it, including myself.  Yeah, you heard me.  Just flip a coin.  You'll probably end up with it.  However, here's the good news.  The younger you are, the better your immune system, the less likely it's going to impact you.  Now, I didn't say just because you're a 25-year-old healthy guy that you're not going to have any consequences.  I said it is likely that you probably won't have any issues.  Bottom line is, in simple terms, keep yourself clean, keep your health hygiene up, and keep your immune system up as best you can.  Plenty of videos about that.  I don't need to go into the details on that.  All right.  Now, how are you going to make money in today's market volatility?  That's the most important thing and how you are going to survive financially.  One.  you're going to start stockpiling cash.  i have said this going back three years to the beginning of this channel you've got to have reserves.  you've got to have money set aside.  you've got to have an emergency fund.  gentlemen if you're in a war if you're a general you don't put all your troops all 100% of your troops into battle.  You were always holding some back.  You're always holding some reserves.  Whatever it takes now, you need to start saving money.  You need to get out of debt and start putting money aside.  If you got to start living like an immigrant, if you got to start living on beans and rice, if you got to start doing without air conditioning and without the cable TV and the Netflix and whatever, I'm gonna highly encourage you in the strongest terms possible to start right now and do it.  start building reserves start building cash.  cash is not trash.  as I have said in numerous videos winter is not just coming.  I'm afraid winter might be here and I'll be talking about that in the future.  I highly recommend for some of you.  you start thinking about job losses, bankruptcy.  You start thinking about what would I do in a recession.  I've done a video specifically about ideas on how to handle a recession, etc.  Two, if you haven't already, start buying bonds.  Specifically, I'm talking about when I say bonds, U.S.  government bonds.  Yeah, you heard me.  This is debt from the U.S.  government.  Has anybody noticed?  Oh, by the way, U.S.  government bonds are up 15% in a month.  You heard me.  15% in a month.  Gentlemen, that almost like never happens.  Hello?  For two and a half years I have been suggesting that men need to allocate some money to bonds.  This is a relatively safe way to keep some money aside, to keep some of those reserves aside, to protect yourself from a total meltdown to getting yourself into a black hole that could take years if not decades to build yourself out of.  Three, again, buy some gold and silver.  I know a lot of you are younger people.  You feel like gold, silver, this is like, what are you, crazy?  I get it, okay?  Look, the reason why I'm so big on gold and silver, and oh, by the way, when I was a young man, when I was in my 20s, it was still a weird idea.  It was considered the stupidest thing to be buying gold and silver, and that was 30 plus years ago.  Look, Gold and silver have been used as a means of currency, as a means of exchange for, oh, about 5,000 years.  The point is, you need to put at least a little money into gold and silver.  If you don't know where to pick up any gold and silver, there's probably a coin shop, a metals dealer in your area.  If there's not, go on the internet.  One of the ones that's highly recommended, that I can recommend, I can vouch for, is ampmex, A-M-M-E-X, believe me they're fair people their prices are very good etc.  if you're more of a gambler if you've got if you want a more aggressive idea where you can double your money and oh yeah I'm going to give you a specific idea.  go back and listen to my video from last fall yeah last October where I specifically said to start putting some money into gold stocks I gave some specific names on gold mining stocks.  a lot of those have already gone up 50 100. so if you would even listen to me a little bit and put a thousand dollars you probably have got 1502 grand.  you haven't done badly.  you've done nicely on those.  i think in the gold stock area there's a lot more upside to come in my opinion.  Gentlemen, let me finish by saying, if the projections prove true, if the predictions that we're hearing about from the quote unquote experts and non-experts prove true, listen carefully.  in the united states alone in the next two months you heard me the next 60 days in about let's just say mid-may or so there will be roughly four million people in the united states alone infected with this.  i didn't say they're all going to be catastrophically sick and be hospitalized in an icu but But this will be a meltdown for the healthcare system and correspondingly for the world's largest economy, which the U.S.  economy is.  Now, the projections could be totally wrong, and maybe I'm totally wrong, but let me just ask you this.  What's your downside for preparing?  What is going to be wrong with you just preparing, just doing a little bit of what I'm talking about?  Guess what?  There is no downside to anything that I'm talking about.  So listen to me clearly if you take nothing else.  Stop predicting the future.  Stop trying to know what's going to happen.  Start preparing.  Because when it comes down to it, gentlemen, it's not going to be survival of the fittest.  It's going to be those people that can adapt.  Hit the like button, gentlemen, if you found this useful.
