What's your initial takeaways when you heard that some of your home state of Michigan flipped back to blue?  I mean, this is a state where we've had militia groups.  We're talking about kidnapping the governor.  We've had all kind of shenanigans.  Biden was able to win.  Your Senator Gary Peters, the Democrat, was able to win.  What's your initial reaction? ",

But I think I can say for myself, I'm mostly grateful to.  what really put Michigan over the top, and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, was the black vote.  I mean, black Detroit delivered, and black Flint delivered Michigan for Joe Biden, as did black Philly, as did black Milwaukee, and young people.  If you look at the map of Michigan, Biden won Michigan by winning about, I think we have about 80 counties in Michigan.  Biden won 11 of them.  But it's the I-75 corridor of majority black cities, Flint, Pontiac, Detroit, et cetera.  And then the places where there are large college towns where young people are.  So Ann Arbor, Lansing, East Lansing, that area, the little bit of where I live up in Northwestern, Michigan, all went blue as did a very strong kind of old school union movement piece of the Upper Peninsula.  So that's how that happened.  But it happened the same way in Pennsylvania and in Milwaukee.  Black Atlanta is delivering Georgia, and Hispanic Nevada and Arizona is delivering those two states.  I don't want this to get lost in the discussion.  how people of color, young people, and women made this victory happen.  And when Joe Biden said last night, thanking the black community for having his back, And then he said, and I will have yours.  And that was such a profound moment. ",

The thing is, the people on the right, should they happen to be watching right now, I mean, what I would say to them is that you don't have to be worried.  Joe Biden's not going to take away your guns.  You don't have to be worried about whatever it is you're worried about.  In fact, you should rejoice.  because Joe Biden is going to work toward universal health care for everyone, and that includes you.  He's going to expand the Family Leave Act.  That will help you.  Everything he's going to do, most importantly, starting tomorrow with this COVID task force, he's going to make sure your parents and grandparents aren't going to die from this disease.  this virus.  So these are all good things, regardless whether you're a Democrat or Republican.  But my question, Al, is, and I guess I will ask you this, because we often talk about the spiritual part of this when I come on, because I'm always, Joe Biden last night said that we have to heal.  And I agree with that.  We have to love our neighbor.  We have to love our enemy.  But when healing takes place, sometimes it doesn't have to necessarily be a two-way street because the people who have been abused, whether it's the babies that were ripped out of their mother's arms and put in cages, whether it's the dreamers who have had to suffer through these four years thinking that they might be removed from this country, go down the whole list of the people ",
