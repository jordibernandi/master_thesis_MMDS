            "text": "Hey everybody, thanks for watching our YouTube channel.  We're constantly updating it with new content and never seen before content.  So if you want to get the latest from Harvest, hit the subscribe button.  So how are we to live in light of the fact that Christ could come back?  According to Paul, we are to wake up, we are to sober up, and finally we are to suit up.  First we are to wake up.  Let us not sleep as others do.  Who are these words addressed to?  Christians or non-Christians?  Christians.  Did you know it is possible to fall asleep in the light?  But you know it's possible to be asleep in the church.  And I don't know about you but one of the times that I want to sleep more than any other is after I've had a big meal.  Right?  Like if you have you know two burritos for lunch.  I need to take a nap.  And when I say a nap I'm talking about a coma of sorts.  I mean I am dead to the world.  I don't sleep long.  Maybe eight, nine minutes at the most.  But I just have to sleep the thing off.  Because for me I feel sluggish.  I feel dull.  My brain is not firing as it needs to.  You know and in a way when we are in a church where we are taught the Word of God as we are here at Harvest we can become kind of fat and sassy and lazy.  And we want to be alert.  And we want to be awake.  Instead of being sermon connoisseurs.  We need to be fishers of men.  We need to wake up.  Wake up to the fact that Christ is coming.  Wake up to the fact that time is short.  Wake up to the fact that your redemption is drawing near.  Number two.  You need to sober up.  Verse eight.  Let those of us who are of the day be sobered.  Now having spent the first 17 years of my life around drunk people I think I can speak somewhat authoritatively to this topic.  I have watched people get drunk a lot.  More than anyone should.  And different people react in different ways to alcohol.  You know some people.  they become happy and quote drunk.  You know they have a few drinks.  I love you.  I love you.  Can you give me a hug.  Oh gee.  Other people become mean drunks.  They yell.  They scream.  They throw things.  Some people just completely lose control.  Don't remember anything of what happened the night before.  So the Bible is saying don't be drunk.  Now let's take this at face value.  Do I need to actually say that no Christian should ever be under the influence of alcohol?  Here's a news flash for you.  If you don't drink you'll never get drunk.  But if you do drink you could get drunk.  I don't know about you but I don't want to be under the influence of anyone or anything but Jesus Christ.  I don't want to be I don't want to be controlled by the spirits.  I want to be filled with the Holy Spirit.  And the Bible says don't be drunk with wine which will only ruin your life but be filled with the Spirit.  speaking to yourself in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs and so forth.  So sober up.  But then another way to look at this is there are a lot of things that can intoxicate us besides alcohol or drugs.  Jesus said in Luke 21.34, Take heed to yourself.  Let your hearts be weighed down with carousing drunkenness and the cares of this life and that day, the day of the Lord, come upon you unexpectedly.  Another translation says, Take heed to yourselves and be on guard.  Let your hearts be overburdened and weighed down with the giddiness, headache, and nausea of self-indulgence, drunkenness, and worldly worries.  See it is not always bad things that distract us.  Sometimes it is good things.  There is nothing wrong with being married.  Nothing wrong with having children.  Nothing wrong with having a home, a career.  Those are good things.  God can even bless those things.  But let's keep our priorities in order.  Number one priority in the life of the Christian is God.  God's first.  Then comes family.  And then comes career slash ministry.  Career should not be number one.  Listen.  Even family should not be number one.  God should be number one in everything that you say and do.  And sometimes good things out of their proper place can become bad things because they take the place of the best thing.  And this is what Jesus is warning about.  He's saying I want you to be sober.  And I want you to be alert.  And I don't want anything to distract you.  So keep your focus clear.  So we are to wake up.  We are to sober up.  And lastly we are to suit up.  Verse 8.  Put on a breastplate of faith.  and love.  And as a helmet the hope of salvation.  Listen we are in a spiritual battle.  It started at the day of our conversion.  Oh we will rage on until we get to heaven.  Satan does not want us to follow Christ.  He will do everything he can to stop us from coming to faith.  And if we have already believed in Jesus he will try to neutralize us through compromise.  We're in a spiritual battle.  And we need spiritual weapons.  That's why Paul tells us in Ephesians 6 to put on all of the armor of God that we may be able to stand in that wicked day.  So what is that armor?  Well he tells us put on a breastplate.  And we are to put on a helmet.  Now the helmet would protect the head of the Roman soldier.  The Roman soldier's helmet was carefully designed.  Generally bronze on the outside.  Sometimes it was leather over an iron skull cap.  It was designed to withstand a crushing blow to the head and still protect it.  We need to protect our minds.  It is sort of like when you are out riding your skateboard.  You ought to wear a helmet.  Definitely when you ride a motorcycle you should wear a helmet.  Now not everybody is for helmet laws.  I read a sad thing in the paper the other day about a biker in upstate New York who was participating in a ride to protest helmet laws who died after he crashed his motorcycle and hit his head.  People said if he had been wearing a helmet he would have survived.  And so we need to put our helmet on.  What does that mean?  We need to protect our minds.  The Bible says in 2 Corinthians 10.5 we are to cast down arguments bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Jesus Christ.  Because Satan recognizes the value of first getting a foothold in the realm of the thoughts and imagination.  As this will prepare the way for that thought to translate into an action.  Any person who has ever committed a sin Well, quick poll.  How many of you have ever sinned?  Raise your hand.  Okay, good, good.  Okay.  I'm speaking to the right people.  Any person who has ever committed a sin that would be us first thought about it.  Probably in depth.  Maybe fantasized about it.  Imagined it.  Fed this idea that turned into an action.  It's been summed up this way.  Sow a thought.  Reap an act.  Sow an act.  Reap a habit.  Sow a habit.  Reap a character.  Sow a character.  Reap a destiny.  You know my computer that's overloaded right now with pictures and songs.  I can't put any new programs on.  I tried the other day.  It said idiot dot dot dot.  No it didn't say that.  No it said Your memory is full.  There's no room on my computer for anything new.  So I have to get rid of things.  I don't want to get rid of anything.  I'm going to need those pictures.  I don't want to get rid of that song.  And I need this other thing.  So it's hard.  But it's kind of a good thing.  So when the devil comes with his wicked thoughts, we need to just put up a sign.  Memory full.  No room.  Full of the Word of God.  Full of the things that matter.  There's no room for the idle ideas and thoughts and wicked things.  you would bring my way.  Protect yourself.  Wake up.  Sober up.  Suit up. ",
