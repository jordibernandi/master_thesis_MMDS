            "text": "Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So two things are happening.  First of all, this area really kind of lends itself to the outdoor dining because of the piazza that they built a couple of years ago.  Take a look at this thing.  And I mean, it's already tailor made for the restaurants for outdoor dining.  So that's one thing that they had going on.  But you mentioned the health department and the health department ended up.  You know, while they ended up closing down a lot of restaurants, as they started reopening, they started changing the rules on reopening because of social distancing, which means that they are now, the county health department, allowing these restaurants to move tables into the sidewalks and streets.  And that is what happened over the weekend.  And by the way, at 5 o'clock, we'll get some of that video for you because it's pretty cool.  I mean, it's the whole area has been shut off.  This is the piazza, but the streets up there are the areas that were shut off.  And basically this whole area was one big party.  And the video shows that everybody's behaving themselves.  It looked like everybody was kind of keeping their social distance on and all that kind of thing.  But once again, it's one of those deals where they say we have to survive somehow.  And they went to the county and they said, look, can we move out in the sidewalks and streets?  And they said in this particular area, yes, you can't.  So let's take a little tour.  Take a look at what's going on out here.  This is the food hall.  I don't know if you guys have ever been here, into the piazza here.  But that's the food hall.  And that food hall is like one of those, it's like an upscale food court.  It is exactly what it looks like.  And there's a variety of restaurants in there from Asian to Mexican to seafood.  And it's just absolutely amazing.  Of course, you've got the beautiful fountain here.  No swimming or playing in the fountain, by the way.  When the kids come, keep them out.  And take a look at this.  Each one of these tables... Has a little menu on it, and like a lot of the restaurants are doing these days, it's got the QR code, right?  And all you have to do is take your camera... Point your camera at that thing, and suddenly the menu pops up.  You can actually do everything off the menu, including pay your bill.  And then, of course, here's your public notice.  All the different things.  Do not sit in the piazza if you have a cough or a fever.  Passive use only.  And such and so and so.  You know, all the things that we know.  Now, take a look at this.  What we're going to do is we're going to go say hello to the guy who owns the restaurant called Gray's.  And he also owns the taco place across the place, across the way over there in the food hall.  And we're talking about Sam here.  is Sam Sine, and otherwise known as Sam the Cooking Guy.  And Sam the Cooking Guy has been cooking this entire time.  Ben, and you're still cooking because I can see you got some stuff.  Let me get over on this side so we can get a good shot of this.  First of all, Sam, hello.  How are you? ",

It's a very different concept than not-not.  It's casual, it's shareable kind of food.  It's flatbreads and charcuterie boards and salads and stuff like that.  But back to your question.  I'm getting hungry.  Yes, well, that's the idea.  Back to your question, how are we doing?  Like, we opened Gray's and then closed it five weeks later, which was nothing anybody intended.  But it's coming back.  We're all coming back.  The spirit, there has been a palpable change in how people feel about going out and seeing what's happening outside of their four walls.  And we're very lucky we're in a part of town that people love to come to.  Go ahead. ",

            "text": "Yeah, it was this alfresco plan that the neighborhood came up with.  First one in San Diego.  It let the restaurants that were limited to 50% capacity inside open up, put as many people really within sort of their footprint outside in the street or on the sidewalk.  Restaurants were doing tons of business, people having fun, wine being enjoyed.  food being eaten, people strolling.  There was a group of musicians that were really making the whole place feel like we've matured and we can handle outdoor, entertaining, consuming of food and alcohol and not break into a big fight.  You know, the Europeans have been doing this for years.  And the Piazza della Famiglia is the first place in San Diego you can consume alcohol in public.  It has to be from here.  It has to come from one of these two places.  That being said, it's working.  In the beginning, the liquor license was just for beer and wine out here.  And now the city scene, we're mature enough that we can handle it, not get into fights.  And it feels like Europe to me.  The sun's going down, people are sitting, little kids running.  There's this beautiful fountain that feels like somebody went to Italy and stole a fountain and brought it back in suitcases and built it again.  But it's got this feeling that, I don't know, there's another part of San Diego that feels quite like little Italy does.  Of course I'm a little biased.  Of course you are. ",

Sam, the cooking guy.  owner of not not tacos and of course grace right here.  thank you so much sam.  we're gonna stick around for the five and the six we're gonna i think we're gonna catch up with another guy out here on the street that actually was able to put his tables out in the street in the sidewalk during the big party over the weekend and of course saturday was the day.  and the truth is is this is forced us into situations that we never imagined before, right?  We never imagined that the health department would allow us to take our tables and put them in the sidewalks and the streets.  So this really, this reinvention of our world, of our lives, is every single day it is changing.  And we're out here documenting every one of those changes.  So with that, we'll throw it back to you.  See you back here at 5 and 6.  Take a shot of the piazza instead of my face.  See you later.  Bye-bye. ",
