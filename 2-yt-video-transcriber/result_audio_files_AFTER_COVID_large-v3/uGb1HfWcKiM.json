And if you are noticing a change in my voice, that's because 2020 left me with a good old bit of the poorly.  Not the bad poorly, but poorly nonetheless.  Thanks a lot, you git.  Here's hoping for some good news for the start of Mr.  21.  Maybe if one of them there existential threats turned out to be just a lot of hot air.  That would be lovely, wouldn't it?  Nuclear weapons don't exist?  Well, that's just fantastic news!  Also, before we start, I do know that it is technically nuclear as the pronunciation.  And while I do try to say it like that, honestly, I don't freaking care.  And if I accidentally say it nuclear or nuclear or whatever, if that bothers you, I want you to know that I did it just to upset you specifically.  And not because it's basically a hard-coded part of my dialect and you getting upset about it makes you the asshole or anything like that.  Okay?  Okay. ",

Things like space programs don't get as funded as they probably should, because there's little in the way of short-term benefits.  All the benefits of developing a robust space program are usually multi-generational, so pumping money into it now isn't particularly politically cogent.  So they get way less than other more immediate stuff.  So the idea that NASA is some huge money-spinning program is patently absurd.
