Hello everybody, Terrence Popp here with another episode of Live from the Lair!  Alright, you gotta bear with me, I haven't been to the barber in a while and my hair's f***ing stupid long.  I'm not really in the mood to cut it down to another evil burt, but it might come to that.  Alright, I have got a whole bunch of requests.  And it's in regards to Pimptard Weistitute Adele Edition.  Now before I want to get into this, I want to say a few things.  Number one, I like Adele's music.  Alright, number two, this video is for entertainment purposes only.  And number three, It's not personal.  It's just math.  All right, so over here on this board, we're going to go through some of the variables.  All right, number one, there is $180 million on the table.  They got married roughly in 2017-ish.  There was no prenuptial agreement.  They were married for roughly three years.  The divorce has taken place in California.  It's a one-half, 50-50 split of $180 million.  All right, so here's another one.  The average size of a P. Nice.  Let's go with six inches.  You know, I got a couple different ranges.  when I Googled it and Binged it and looked it up on the internet.  All right, the average length of a sexual encounter, 12 minutes.  with uh... roughly thirty five pumps a minute.  i'm gonna do an estimation of the matrimonial pussy slams.  they met in two thousand eleven.  apparently things went off the hook.  two thousand twelve.  vada voom vada ving one went by the goalie And now they have a son together.  So you go on another five years until 2017.  So by the time they get to 2017, they've already got past the honeymoon stage.  They already have a kid together.  And the magic's gone.  However they want to explain it, it's not up to me to criticize in that regards.  But it is what it is.  We're going to be basically going over the years 2017 to 2019.  Now we all know, as you enter into a relationship, things are off the hook in the beginning.  They're probably banging every chance they could once, twice a day, maybe more, I don't know.  And I'm averaging the numbers up a little bit because they're below 30 and younger people like to do that a lot more.  Because you're thinking with the little head, and it goes awry.  But that's either here or there.  So between 2011 and 2017, that's six years.  Now, if anyone's watched this show, you have the 7, 13, 21, and 24.  And those are basically years for review.  You have the seven-year review, 13-year, 21, and 24.  If you get beyond 24 years of marriage, chances of you getting divorced go way down.  And usually, divorces take place inside of seven years.  Sometimes it's by 13, it all depends.  All right, so I've taken all of those variables into account.  So 2017, he probably hit that pussy 50 times.  2018, 35. and 2019, roughly, 12.  All right, so we have enough of the variables in here to do the math.  This is the best part.  I know you guys love this for that.  So we're gonna move over here.  All right.  You are not the daughter of a god.  And you're not a superhero.  And you don't have an iron suit.  You're 120 pounds soaking wet.  You're not some Mary Sue in a film.  You want to kick my ass?  I'm right here.  Kick my ass.  You don't have any guns?  No.  I do have a couple of grenades, though.  Wait, what?  Oh, I've been a rebel.  Are those for real?  What the hell would I be walking around with fake grenades for?  Do you believe in destiny?  Over here, we have $90 million, which is half of 180. which he technically can get because that's how divorce works.  Now, I was reading a few articles on the internet and there's a lot of women who are bitching and complaining how he has no right to her money and he's not a man and when, when, when.  it's not fair.  Well, ladies, this has been going on with dudes for, I don't know, a hundred goddamn years.  These women get alimony for life and they're entitled to it because they're accustomed to a lifestyle.  Now, a lot of women are now becoming quite successful in the business world and in life.  The same rules apply to them.  Alright, so you have 90 million divided by 97 hits on the pussy.  For each time he stepped up to bat while he was married to her, He was basically getting compensated $927,835 each time for 12 minutes worth of work.  Winning.  All right, so you take 12 minutes times 35 pumps a minute.  You come up with 420 pumps per session.  420.  It's a funny number.  So you take $927,835, and that's the cost per session, divide it by 420 pumps.  All right, so at the end, it costs you $2,209.13 per pump.  Holy .  All right, now we're gonna do the price per inch of cock.  All right, so you have 420 pumps times 97 times 6 inches.  You're roughly, that's 244,440 inches of cock in the 97 marriage sessions.  So you take 90 million and you divide it by 244440.  And roughly, Mrs.  Dale paid $368.18 per inch of cock.  Again, this is entertainment, gentlemen.  Don't hate me, but it's just math.  It's nothing personal.  All right, now we're going to do the equivalency test here.  $90 million.  How much cock would she have to get before she breaks even on that $90 million?  Roughly the average lifespan, 82 years.  Might be a little shorter for her because she's gravitationally challenged.  I don't know.  Minus how old she is now, roughly 32.  That leaves 50 years left.  You take 50 years, multiply by 365 days, you roughly get 18,250 days left of sucking air on the earth.  That sounds like a big number until you get to the end and then it goes by like that.  All right, so on average, to tie down a new piece of cock, minimal investment, 100 bucks.  So you take the 90 million, divide it by 100 bucks, you get 900,000 cock transactions.  You take the number of days she has left, divide it into 900,000 transactions, and it comes down to roughly 39.3 cocks a day in transactions.  That's a whole lot of cock, just saying.  Because there are many celebrities out there who, they say they have some pretty extensive accounts, And I would tend to believe them.  So at the end of the day, who in this equation is the pimptart and weistitude?  Alright, now in all honesty, I would say it's the husband who's being the weistitude here.  Alright, he's plainly benefiting from this whole goddamn transaction.  Which, to me, that's what it sounds like.  Yeah, they have a kid together and what have you.  And I'm sure there's a lot of heartbreak and pain going on.  But, you know, you'll get over that.  It is what it is.  You know, I don't know, man.  It's just cold, hard math.  Nothing personal.  All right, gentlemen.  I hope you like this Pimp Tart Wife-stitute.  Please like it and share it.  I'll talk to you later. ",
