            "text": "Welcome to the Daily Injection Program, show number seven.  This is March 25th.  I want everybody to know that later on today I'll be interviewing Ron Paul.  We all know his son, Rand Paul, tested positive for COVID-19.  So that will be a very interesting interview.  I'm also going to talk to him about gold, gold revaluation, which is a big topic on my agenda right now, and the either legitimate or illegitimate abuse of power by the federal government and what's going on right now with everything from FEMA to everything else.  Is this a legitimate response to a pandemic or is this a power grab?  I want to start off with a very important question that I'm debating these days with hedge fund managers and various other market participants.  And it is the question of whether or not this is really a bear market.  In other words, Is this a classic bear market?  And we're going to see many of these mini rallies, fake rallies that will put people back in it, the dumb money, so to speak, and allow an excuse or liquidity issue for big time traders to pull out their gains, their profits, or not.  Are we hitting a bottom?  And is this classical where, hey, if the talking heads on NBC are saying, buy the dip, are they wrong just because this is a bear market?  So a big topic.  And what I want you to know is depending on your age, depending on your risk tolerance, you should already be thinking about opportunities in this market.  Yes, stocks can go down by another 10 to 15%.  The major indice is if there's still tailwind and risks, for example, from India, from a resurgence in China, from Europe not handling what's going on in France, Spain, and Italy in the right way, and this becoming a big disaster.  If in the  U.S.,  government Cuomo and California and New York, so both of these, epicenters than washington state if they're not able to do it.  yes there are many risks involved on the flip side.  let's look at what the federal government and the federal reserve have already promised and are already working on right.  so that's one thing.  is it a real bear market?  do we need to treat it like a bear market?  or do we need to really think hey if this didn't would have happened how will our economy be?  because all that skill all that potential all that demand it's there.  and now you you also have very low uh oil prices.  so that's very good for the um for all industries.  basically once uh we're on the other side of this consumer is gonna have uh less expenses uh the airlines etc.  all these impacted industries will have better profit margin because obviously fuel plays a big time impact on that.  shipping will be cheaper.  a lot of energy companies are Also able to sustain this and if you're not able to sustain low oil prices or lower oil prices There'll be a lot of bankruptcies.  bad loans will be cleaned out of systems the banks balance looking better and we can move forward.  I like these cleansing events, whether or not they're out of the blue or just due to stupidity and leverage and all that.  They clean the system.  better, more equipped people can come in.  What we don't want to see is we don't want to see unfairness.  And that's why I like the rescue bills, because both the Democrats and Republicans chipped in.  They both got what they wanted.  It looks like the country's united in the way that they want to move forward on this.  I want to talk to you, secondly, about restrictions on corporate America going forward.  The buybacks are going to be problematic.  As you've seen in many of my graphs and charts, or if you've not, go to wealthresearchgroup.com.  forward slash QE and forward slash over for those reports.  Buybacks have been the most predominant buyers from 2009 to 2020.  Most people, most of the big movement generation have been selling into strength for about 11 years now.  Corporations have been buying shares, obviously it works in their benefit for many reasons.  Plus they haven't seen real opportunities to enhance dividends or to use a lot of money for capital expenditures.  Because salaries have been so stagnated around the world, they've been able to do everything.  They've been able to do share repurchases, dividends, capital expenditures, and retain cash, and do mergers and acquisitions.  This has been a great bull market for for corporations and stocks for the past 11 years.  We'll see what happens going forward.  Be very wary of these restrictions on corporations because that's going to keep a cap and a ceiling on share prices going forward.  And that's actually good.  That means that you'll have two, three, four years if you're younger, like I am, to buy shares of great companies when they're not rallying up their in V-shaped form.  If you're older, you're 55 and up, you need to look at other ways of creating income from your portfolio.  Because for one, I don't think that the equity markets are going to explode like rockets.  I think they'll have a meaningful time to absorb everything that's going on.  The coronavirus will be with us for the next two, three years in some way, shape or form.  It's Brace for that and embrace it.  And therefore, in our newsletter, we're going to cover many ways outside of the stock market to generate income because I don't think the stock market is where retirees should be.  Thirdly, and really importantly, gold, silver shortages are really there.  Banks are actually defaulting on their problems.  They're saying, hey, we cannot deliver physical.  We're stopping this practice altogether.  between Switzerland, New York, London, Hong Kong, these four hubs of the gold delivery system, the physical gold delivery system.  It's very hard to move gold around these days.  And you might see a real big spike, like you saw yesterday, a real big spike again, over 1700.  And man, oh man, with mines shutting down around the world, mining stocks look so, so good.  Finally, after nine, 10 years of a bear market for most of them, disgusting bear market, if I may say so.  This is looking very clean, very healthy, very good, and even good compared to regular stocks, which is what the mining stocks compete with.  Because regular stocks, if they can create a meaningful income for people, meaningful and stable income, people will shy away from mining stocks.  Mining stocks are riskier, more problematic, more volatile, but people will go to them when they see that the rest of the economy is faltering.  So This is huge.  On that, I really suggest that you go to wealthresearchgroup.com forward slash gold playbook.  It's the most comprehensive A to Z on investing in gold and silver.  And I'm going to have a big update from you because I'm doing the rounds every day calling the biggest bullion dealers in the country.  And I want to give you updates on what's happening.  Fourthly, I want to talk about nibbling.  I am definitely... a buyer of stocks right now.  um some companies i don't want to mess with i just don't.  i don't know where their path is going and i have no strategic advantage at buying these types of distressed companies.  for example if buffett is a big buyer of or big owner of southwest and delta he has a vested interest to see boeing doing well.  so he may uh start owning a majority stake in boeing And then under one umbrella, he has the strategic ability to help the airlines by owning Boeing and vice versa.  As a small time investor, you don't need that.  And you don't need to look at these strategic moments.  Look at companies that are gonna be minimally affected by the coronavirus and just start to nibble because some companies have gone down by a disproportionate amount.  If you Google, the S&P 500 components and start going one by one, all these 500 companies and simply leave out any company that you have no idea what they do or you have no idea what their industry does.  Focus on the 40, 50 companies that you really know And start to think about their price, their valuation compared to the price and the way that they will handle themselves going forward.  And then you can start figuring out that if that's too big for you, just go with the big indices, the S&P 500, the Dow and the Nasdaq and start thinking, can I start to put my money back in there?  Because we have shut off about four years worth of price appreciation, but the dividend is still there.  The income is still there.  really quite good.  So that's the fourth thing I wanted to share with you.  Fifth, let's talk about this Easter deadline.  And I love when Trump does these deadlines.  So he wants April 12 to be the deadline where we start releasing people back into the economy.  I think that's good just psychologically to put that into people's heads, because now everyone will work towards that goal simultaneously.  The hotspots like New York City, they will not open.  by April 12th.  But the United States is as big as Europe.  It's a huge landmass.  And in some states, you have a couple of infected people or one death, et cetera.  You don't need to close the entire country.  Do it state by state, municipality by municipality, region by region, with a lot of restrictions, with a social distancing mode.  I expect restaurants to have issues for a long time.  Every gathering of people, every new business that relies on gathering to have issues for a very long time.  We will see a lot of self-mandated people saying, okay, I don't want to be in this kind of an environment, in this kind of an area.  And so you will see slowly but surely people going back to normal.  But definitely this is going to be with us for a year, year and a half.  Think about that in terms of your lifestyle.  But definitely I like that deadline.  I don't like it if it's not realistic, but I do like it if you can back it up with staff equipment and hospital bed space.  Lastly, Trump's approval ratings are moving up and they're basically at all time highs.  Now, this is important because if he can get reelected.  and the market starts pricing that, then you have a lot of momentum for businesses.  Businesses love Trump.  Business people love Trump.  Entrepreneurs love Trump.  And that's very important for the entire economy.  Now with the Democrats getting a lot of what they wanted from these bills, the rescue bills, they are also happier and there will be less friction between Democrats and Republicans going forward.  And that's something important.  Lastly, I want to make sure that all people know that 1.3 billion Indians are currently on almost a two-week quarantine.  And that's very unfortunate that... 1.3 billion people are not leaving their houses.  But I want you to really think about how amazing our lives are without these quarantines.  How amazing... Do we have it in the 21st century?  And every day I really look within and understand that we're living in such a tremendous time.  Even a global pandemic is not able to crush us for more than a few months.  We have a very robust global economy.  It is loaded with problems, for sure.  But what time in history was not?  I mean, people started living in caves and couldn't even light a fire.  Their daily struggles were, how can I stay heated enough?  Do I have enough calories?  We have moved in the last 120 years to such an incredible life.  And you should really be appreciative of this.  I try to be appreciative of this every single day by reading my own principles and sticking to them.  And that's on wealthresearchgroup.com.  forward slash me, M-E.  Again, let's reconvene here tomorrow.  I wanna really see how the markets react after their best day since 1933, whether or not they can do another, either a flap or an update today and what gold and silver do.  And that's gonna impact a lot of what's gonna happen with how this plays out with April 12 as the deadline.  And we'll definitely touch base tomorrow.  Thank you for joining us today. ",
