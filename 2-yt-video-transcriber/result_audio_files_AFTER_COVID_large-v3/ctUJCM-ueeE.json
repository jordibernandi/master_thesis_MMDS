My, oh my, I don't even know where to begin here.  All right.  If you've been following the developments going on in our nation, I don't think there's any way around the conclusion that we are indeed seeing nothing less than a very real civil war breaking out.  Now, of course, it's not the 1860s all over again.  This is not a conventional civil war where the military splits into two different sides or anything like that.  It's not a geographic civil war with the North versus the South.  It's not an ideological war involving conservatives versus liberals, the political right versus the political left.  Instead, it appears increasingly the case that we are seeing what is in effect a regional conflict between rural America versus urban America.  And it's actually being fought, it appears, on three fronts.  It's being fought at the level of direct conflict in the streets with militias and groups like Proud Boys.  taking on and facing down Antifa and Black Lives Matter radicals.  That's on one front.  It's also being fought from within the political and cultural left itself.  The left is actually going through its own internal civil war.  And then thirdly, there's a civil war of sorts involving the pandemic, where rural populations have basically abandoned urban populations who are being disproportionately affected in terms of the casualty counts by the coronavirus.  And so I wanna explore these fronts because I think they're showing a clear winner at this point in this developing civil war.  And that winner is unquestionably rural America.  The exurbs are beating the urban areas.  And even those sympathetic with urban populations and causes and grievances are admitting this as we shall see.  Let's start with the direct conflicts that have clearly escalated as of this weekend.  Localized battles were sparked in cities all across the nation the last 48 hours.  And behind the brawls, we're seeing on the one side, the rise of militias, the return of groups like the Proud Boys.  And on the other side, we're seeing Antifa and BLM agitators.  And the pattern that seems to be playing out virtually everywhere is that Antifa and BLM members are simply not prepared to take on the massive resistance coming from America's militias and patriot groups, as well as law enforcement that are standing against Antifa and BLM forces invading the nation's suburbs.  So let's start with what happened in Michigan.  The organization known as the Proud Boys, I'm sure you're all very well familiar with them, they clashed with Antifa and BLM activists in downtown Kalamazoo.  The Proud Boys had planned a rally in support of President Trump and in support of our nation as a whole when Antifa agitators showed up to stage their own event.  And well, let's just say things didn't turn out too well for them.  The Proud Boys were reported to have been well armed with assault weapons.  And when the fighting did eventually break out, they released some kind of pepper spray or some kind of chemical irritant, which quickly sent these Antifa thugs running.  In Chicago, police absolutely cracked down on protesters big time.  Police are claiming that they were first attacked and that they went into this with a zero tolerance attitude that if just one police officer was assaulted, that's it.  They would smash the protests and end it right away.  And that's precisely what they did.  So we're talking pepper spray, batons, dozens of arrests.  It was such a decisive crackdown that protesters or better agitators are demanding at least an apology from the police department, if not a full investigation.  But again, we're seeing a similar pattern in Chicago that we've been seeing develop in our other cities where the ultra left mayor, in this case, Lori Lightfoot, is actually siding now with the police.  After months of siding with BLM and Antifa agitators, the mayor now has no choice but to side with law enforcement in order to keep businesses and residents from leaving Chicago and completely devastating the city like what we're seeing in New York City right now under the tenure of the ultra incompetent Bill de Blasio, who's single handedly destroying that city.  It's just absolutely tragic.  Let's go over to Portland, Oregon.  I love, I love this headline from the left wing activist disguised as journalists over at the Washington Post.  Check this one out.  Violent clashes erupt between far right groups and far left groups, right?  Of course not, that would violate the Washington Post policy of shilling for all things left wing.  So the title goes like this, violent clashes erupt between far right groups and racial justice protesters in Portland.  Racial justice, I sweat you glisten.  You rob, I redistribute.  Now, it goes on to detail how these groups tied with far-right organizations gathered in downtown Portland on Saturday to wave American flags.  How dare they?  How horrible, these symbols of systemic oppression, American flags.  And then they had the audacity to push back against BLM protesters that were there simply to challenge police brutality, right?  Again, the BLM agitators didn't seem prepared to deal with the use of pepper spray and pellets fired from paintball guns coming from these far right extremists.  And once again, we're seeing which side law enforcement is siding with.  BLM activists are complaining about how the police were fully supportive of the right wing group while they were especially harsh against what the Washington Post called these left leaning crowd.  Again, is this not hilarious?  The far right wing versus left leaning crowds.  But again, we've done videos on this before.  How the heck do you expect law enforcement to help you when all you do is accuse them of the worst crimes against humanity and demanding that they be defunded and abolished?  I mean, what the hell do you expect them to come within 10 feet of you?  It's absurd.  But in the scuffle, one Antifa agitator in particular tried to take on the police himself.  And let's just say he instantly regretted it.  He was showered with pepper spray.  He was mowed down with pepper balls.  Ouch.  Moreover, we're seeing the devastating effects of the Civil War that's erupted within the political left in Portland in particular.  The far left Mayor Ted Wheeler has been trying to get his city under control.  He's turned on the Antifa thugs that just weeks ago he was the biggest supporter of.  He's finally admitted that Antifa was actively attempting to commit murder and trying to burn down a police station.  with police officers inside the building.  Well, now he's got this far left district attorney turning against him, his fellow Mike Schmidt.  He's a rabid leftist, and he's refusing to prosecute rioters that police have arrested, which in turn has prompted the state police, who recently deployed into Portland to make up for the gap left by federal officers leaving the city.  Well, now the state police are leaving.  They're telling the mayor and this district attorney there to shove it, which is completely undermining the mayor's capacity to restore law and order in this imploding left wing city.  So once again, we're seeing the left versus the left here.  A leftist mayor is clashing with the leftist district attorney and state law enforcement is saying a pox on both your houses.  We're out of here.  Deal with it yourself.  Now, as if things weren't bad enough for the far left in our nation, to make matters even worse now, you have the continued fallout from the pandemic that is disproportionately destroying urban populations.  John Bennett over The Independent has an interesting piece on how the coronavirus has become another location for this burgeoning civil war.  Now, Bennett makes no effort at hiding his left wing sentiments.  But he does admit that rural America has simply not been anywhere near as affected by the coronavirus as urban America has.  The COVID casualties have been disproportionately on the side of America's urban populations.  And rather than create a sense of solidarity and sympathy and empathy from America's rural populations, It seems to provoke the exact opposite.  America's rural populations seem quite intent on weakening and debilitating America's urban populations as much as they can, and it's working.  Our cities have never been weaker.  They've never been more chaotic or bankrupt.  I mean, they're the last places anyone wants to live in right now.  And Bennett isn't alone in this assessment.  Ron Brownstein over at The Atlantic observed something very similar, recognizing that the coronavirus was indeed hardening the divide between red states and blue states, the rural versus the urban.  Jonathan Chait over at the Intelligencer is a bit more blunt in his assessment.  He questions whether Trump even cares about the coronavirus killing off left wing blue America.  It's probably one of the more hysterical pieces I've read in a long time, but I think he speaks for a lot of leftists among our political class, our ruling elite.  that are slowly but surely recognizing that this pandemic is disproportionately weakening them.  It's adversely affecting blue states.  And red states, conservative states are all like, well, that's what you get when you're hell bent to bend your knee to the gods of globalism, open up our borders, let anybody in.  And then they all gather in these cities.  And then you have leftist politicians that are more worried about enforcing politically correct language in terms of what we call COVID-19 than they are about trying to solve the problem.  They're more concerned by what we call it than the virus itself.  I mean, what do you expect?  You've been demanding in the name of going green.  You've been demanding everyone live in these densely packed cities and urban areas.  And then when Trump issues a travel ban against China, you turn around, you call him xenophobic.  Left wing blue states, you've brought this on yourselves.  You made your own bed.  Now you gotta sleep in it.  We're opening up our economies.  Red state economies are flourishing, and you blue states are in a continuous lockdown.  You're gonna have to deal with it.  And so as we can see, we really are seeing the emergence of a civil war that's being fought on three fronts.  A direct confrontation on the streets, a civil war that's erupted from within the political left itself, and a civil war of disproportionate COVID casualties adversely affecting left-wing blue states.  Everywhere we look in this burgeoning civil war, the left is getting crushed.  And if things continue the way they have, we ain't seen nothing yet.
