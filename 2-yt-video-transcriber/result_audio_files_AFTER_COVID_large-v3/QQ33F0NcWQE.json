You might remember the other day I covered Emily Maitlis melting down on the Newsnight program during the Dominic Cummings scandal.  that was obviously just the media hyping up a storm in a teacup.  Well, as you might remember, Emily Maitlis sat there on the BBC Newsnight program and said this.  Good evening. ",

The longer ministers and Prime Minister tell us he worked within them, the more angry the response to this scandal is likely to be.  He was the man, remember, who always got the public mood, who tagged the lazy label of elite on those who disagreed.  He should understand that public mood now, one of fury, contempt and anguish.  He made those who struggle to keep to the rules feel like fools and has allowed many more to assume they can now flout them.  The Prime Minister knows all this, but despite the resignation of one minister, growing unease from his backbenchers, a dramatic early warning from the polls and a deep national disquiet, Boris Johnson has chosen to ignore it.  Tonight we consider what this blind loyalty tells us about the workings of Number 10.  We do not expect to be joined by a government minister, but that won't stop us... ",

            "text": "Which, as I covered at the time, was drawing complaints from the British public, and rightly so.  The BBC is funded by us, and therefore it should certainly remain impartial, though we already know it doesn't.  Well, just this morning there was an update to this story and the Express have picked up on it here.  BBC complaints soar to 40,000 as fury at Emily Maitlis' Cummings rant continues to rage.  And I am glad to be one of those 40,000 people who put a complaint in about this.  The BBC has received 40,000 complaints in just two days after viewers accused the broadcaster's Newsnight host Emily Maitlis of departing from the station's impartiality code in her criticism of Dominic Cummings.  The complaints rushed in after Miss Maitlis delivered a highly critical monologue as you heard about the Dominic Cummings lockdown controversy during an episode of Newsnight on Tuesday.  Miss Maitlis accused Boris Johnson of showing blind loyalty to Mr Cummings, who had driven 260 miles from London to County Durham during the coronavirus lockdown.  The news host said Mr Cummings had broken the rules and had made the public feel like fools, when in actual fact most of the public didn't really care.  they were just sick of hearing the media constantly going on about it with the BBC leading the charge alongside Robert Peston of ITV and every single Sky News host there is out there.  They were all equally at it together at the end of the day.  While also they are forgetting the fact that countless Labour MPs, SNP MPs and who knows else, along with Tories, have broken the lockdown rules multiple times.  Some of them driving much further than Dominic Cummings and for far stupider reasons than trying to look after your kid, which obviously is not a stupid reason.  It's a valid reason.  Who cares about the law when your children's health is at risk?  The BBC was forced to release an embarrassing statement saying the programme had not met standards of due impartiality, which was what I was covering the other day.  The statement added staff had been reminded of the guidelines, yet because they had forgot and just went on a left-wing diatribe instead of actually being an impartial journalist, which the BBC haven't been for a long time now, it would seem.  But in a statement on Thursday, the BBC defended its editorial decision in flagship programs such as Newsnight.  Because obviously, admitting they are wrong is a bit too much for the BBC.  It said, No, it really doesn't.  It literally just attacks the government for every single thing, and essentially is a Labour and SNP party political broadcast most of the time.  Our editorial guidelines allow us to make professional judgments, but not to express opinion, which they all seem to do a hell of a lot of the time.  The dividing line can be fine, but we aim to say so if we think we have overstepped the mark.  Well, you'll be saying that weekly.  I'm sure everyone would agree.  The introduction to Newsnight was intended as a summary of the issues that would be explored, with all of the supporting facts and evidence in the program.  But as broadcast, it risked giving the perception that the BBC was taking sides and expressing an opinion rather than being impartial, which obviously it was.  If it wasn't the BBC, it was certainly Emily Maitlis and possibly the Newsnight show itself.  Some viewers have been incensed at what they see as the BBC Two shows biased against Mr Cummings and the government.  This is beyond doubt at this point.  The BBC received tens of thousands of complaints recently relating to Emily Maitlis' Newslight monologue.  The complaints were from both the opponents and supporters of the presenter's comments.  Most of the complaints were due to Ms Maitland's comments that Dominic Cummings broke the rules.  She added, as you heard, the country can see that and it shocked the government cannot.  A second wave of complaints came from individuals who are angry at BBC managers who ruled that Maitlis overstepped the mark and broke impartiality guidelines which to me proves that she 100% did because they actually back what she said when usually these people accuse the BBC of being Tory supporters which is just nonsensical.  and maybe all the remainers decided to put in some complaints because they heard about complaints going the other way, either through articles or from the YouTubers who covered it in videos.  A BBC spokesman declined to comment on the exact number of complaints, but sources at the corporation have told the Daily Mail that the complaints team had been swamped with tens of thousands of responses.  This prompted the complaints team to set up a dedicated page for this single incident, which I will link below for you.  Miss Maitlis's original comments went viral across social media where they won the praise and derision but it has been reported that she was reprimanded by BBC bosses following discussions on Wednesday as I covered.  Now following on from this we have the Express also reporting Emily Maitlis and TV stars will be policed online by BBC to make sure they stay impartial.  Because obviously, as Guido Fawkes reported yesterday, Emily Maitlis' Twitter has been analysed by them, or someone connected to them at least, with 96.8% of all of her tweets being anti-Boris, showing her complete and utter bias.  Following the embarrassing apology, the BBC eventually gave over the partisan and inaccurate opening monologue to Wednesday night's Newsnight.  Guido decided to dig deeper into the institutional problem with the BBC's flagship show.  Crawling through the last 100 tweets and retweets of top presenter Emily Maitlis, Guido found just one that could arguably be positive about Boris, a retweet of New Statesman journalist Stephen Bush criticising Labour's education policy.  Whereas 31 criticized the MP, meaning 96.8% of tweets which were not neutral were anti-Boris.  Many of those classed as neutral included editorialized criticism of Donald Trump, because obviously Orange Man Bad is the same as Demonic Cummings.  So it's probably things like that that bring about the BBC having to do this which to be honest I think is a bit over the top and slightly censorious.  but it does not surprise me that the BBC have got to do it because of all these left-wing lunatics that they've got working for them and the nonsense they spout on Twitter.  The BBC has hired a former executive to review how it maintains impartiality on social media.  It comes after several journalists, including Emily Maitlis, Laura Koonsberg and Andrew Neil, have been accused of sharing their own opinions on political matters, which I think everyone would agree.  they 100% have been most of the time.  Even Andrew Neil, who is probably the only slightly honest one out of the lot of them.  Richard Sandbrook, a former director of global news at the corporation, will review online behavior of programs and staff.  The journalist, who is currently director of journalism at Cardiff University, will examine whether impartiality guidelines are being adhered to on platforms like Twitter.  He will also review how programs such as Question Time and Newsnight use social media.  Yep, questions certainly need to be asked about Question Time, not just Newsnight, as you will all know.  Such programs often share short clips of provocative moments in isolation of meaning or greater context of the full broadcast.  In February, the BBC was criticized for posting a video of an anti-immigrant rant by an audience member of Question Time without first fact-checking the comments made.  That's because if they fact-checked them, they would probably be 100% correct.  Some people at the BBC fear a need to create viral and shareable content has led to the undermining of the corporation's reputation.  No, that is the journalist as well, not just what they're doing on social media.  It is them in general, editors, going all the way to the top, it would seem.  The Newsnight presenter isn't the only one to have been criticized for their commentary online.  Other BBC hosts such as Hugh Edwards, Andrew Neil, Gary Lineker and Laura Koonsberg have come under fire for tweeting their political views, which potentially violates rules.  staff must be impartial.  Mr Lineker, who presents Match of the Day, has often been criticised for vocalising his liberal anti-Brexit opinions online.  Yes, we've criticised him many times.  Luckily, no one's listening to Lineker when it actually comes to politics, or certainly not Brexit.  But I think you would agree that 40,000 complaints and someone overlooking what these people tweet on Twitter goes to show just how bad the BBC has got, that they've got to start reining it in just to try and rescue some of their reputation.  And while all 40,000 wasn't against Emily Maitlis' rant, at least definitely some of them were, possibly more than the other way around, we won't know because the BBC are not actually going to tell us.  But like I said, I'll put the link down below for you to complain if you actually want to.  Now before I go, I've started doing live streams and uploading gaming content on my second channel.
