            "text": "If you've been paying attention at all, you know that the censorship dam is cracking.  Evil is unleashed.  They have censored the president of the United States off of his greatest platform to communicate to 88 million people.  And you may not know that he didn't join Parler.  and Parler has also been removed from Apple and from Google Play.  Um, the president could email before, but they know that as well.  So the email service provider of Trump's campaign is not allowing him to contact his millions of supporters.  So I know you're waiting for an update and this is probably the quickest, shortest update I can give you is the crackdown is on since January 6th.  It's the day of infamy.  It's the day when they really thought that they have the ability to control information and to silence people.  But we will not be silenced because the truth will not be shackled and Jesus will not allow the world to control him.  His truth will go out.  It will never stop.  We're on the winning side.  But what we need to do is we need to be as wise as serpents and as gentle as doves.  We need a way to better communicate with you.  My next prophetic update coming very soon here on YouTube may get us a strike or may get erased because we have information and we have videos that are either not shared or not even shareable anymore.  Their policies are just playing footloose with the First Amendment, with freedom of speech.  But we're not going to back down when I tell you what we believe is going on and what the truth is.  And that's all we care about as Christians, right?  We care about Jesus and the truth.  He is the truth.  So we need a way to better keep in touch with you.  And we used to just say subscribe and people would leave emails.  But we're asking you, that's not enough anymore.  They can't block emails.  They can blacklist email.  They can say your email is spam or they don't allow you to mass mail people.  And with a ministry like ours, we got tens of thousands of people subscribe and supporting all over.  So we need your phone number.  Now, I think the best way is to come to discoverchurch.online.  and become a supporting member.  Galatians 6.6 says, if you've ever been blessed by a teacher, it's a proper thing to communicate or to give and receive with your teacher, not just to take and consume, but also to participate by giving.  But I know that some of you are wonderful people and you're just supporting other ministries.  or for some reason.  you can't afford anything right now, and that's fine.  There's no pressure at all.  If you can't afford, you come to discoverchurch.online for less than a dollar a day, you'll be supporting this ministry.  And people say, well, why do you charge?  Because we're not billionaires.  We're not Jack Dorsey.  We're not Mark Zuckerberg with a team of 20,000 people to censor billions of dollars, all made from basically us users.  They're gathering our data and profiting from that.  So we're an ordinary ministry.  We're very blessed.  God is good.  We're expanding this year, but we need more of our supporters to be able to communicate, get videos, get weekly sermons directly from an uncensored server and a platform.  We have that at discoverchurch.online.  Thank God.  Thank Jesus.  He did prepare us for that.  But for the many subscribers out there that may just end up being lost, you know, you're not notified or unsubscribe.  or you're just finding out about us for the first time on this video, that's fine.  Come instead to subscribe at discover.org.au.  slash subscribe.  Please go over there.  It's a very easy link.  And the most important information is to put your phone number there.  We'll keep it safe.  We don't sell it or anything.  And we'll only text you important news.  We're not going to barrage you.  But I think email is not safe anymore.  No social media is safe right now until there's a real viable alternative that can't get censored.  And Parler has been censored.  So we need to text you.  I think phone numbers are safe because all the platforms out there depend on your phone numbers.  And they have to respect that privacy.  I just don't know how they're going to be able to censor that because that's our private phone number.  and we'll be able to text you any important update.  And if I come to your country or anything like that, or word just for your region, I'll text you, okay?  Or important news just for you guys in specific regions, we'll text according to your region.  So please leave your country.  It will be there anyway.  It will be in your country code.  It will auto populate your country code when you select your country and then leave your mobile or your cell number as Americans call it.  Don't leave a landline or a home number.  Leave your mobile phone cell phone number.  And that's gonna be very helpful in the days coming when the censorship heats up, we'll be able to keep in touch with you.  All right, guys, this is supposed to be just a short word to prepare you because the next video is gonna be hot.  It's gonna be a fresh word, a fresh manna from heaven.  And it's what you guys have been asking and waiting for.  So we're going to show you some stuff that you probably have not seen before.  All right.  So keep praying for us.  We're praying for you.  We do appreciate you.  We know that God has brought us together from all over the world.  And there's a purpose to that.  The devil is not going to stop it when it keeps serving God together as a body.  All right.  God bless.  We'll see you soon in the next video.  Share it.  OK, share it because YouTube is suppressing it.  Keep sharing.  God bless. ",
