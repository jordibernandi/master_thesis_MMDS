            "text": "Hey, what's up, y'all?  How y'all living?  What's going on with y'all, family?  Y'all pop on in the room.  How are y'all living?  What's going on with y'all, man?  What's happening?  I hope y'all having a good, refreshed Saturday.  What's going on with you?  What's up, Yanez?  There we go.  There's a lot of y'all coming on in the room.  Pop on in the room, okay.  My girl's next to a nigga.  What's going on with y'all?  Get out of my way.  Just checking in with the family.  Everybody pop on in the room.  On my way back to the crib, running errands.  I hope y'all doing good out there.  You just watched the interview I did with Nick Cannon.  What's up, uncle?  What's up, cousin Jerry in the house?  Everybody say what's up to cousin Jerry in the house.  Yeah, I took the twist out.  I had to take the twist out and blow it out a little bit.  I had to take the twist out.  I started looking like a single mother who lost her kids because she was on crack.  So I had to get that out.  Plus, I went swimming at the crib today, so I had to take that out.  But listen, family, listen, listen.  Y'all know that video I put up of this brother fighting this race soldier off of him.  This was down there in Louisiana, okay?  This brother, I put this video up.  It's on my timeline.  These brothers were walking, and a race soldier just pushed up on them for nothing, tried to gaffle them up, and this brother fought this fucking race soldier back, okay?  He fought him off of them.  Now, they arrested this brother.  His name is Jonathan Rhodes, okay?  His name is Jonathan Rhodes, okay?  He's currently in jail down there in Alexandria, Louisiana.  I think that's the name of it, okay?  There were a couple of fake GoFundMes because a lot of these folks are trying to finesse the game.  But there were a couple of fake GoFundMes, family.  Do not contribute to any of them, okay?  Listen, I need the family to help out a little bit here.  If you wanna help, put, send something to the cash app.  I just bailed him out, guys.  I just sent money down to the bail bondsman just now, literally before I got on the phone with you, because there was a lot of people faking the funk.  I'm telling you what the real deal is.  I just got off the phone with the bail bondsman.  We were sending money down there.  You know, I had to send it through different, you know, I had to send some through Cash App, you know, because there's only certain, there's certain limits that you can set.  But I just sent the money down to the bail bondsman down there and they're going to get them.  If you guys want to contribute and help out, help offset this a little bit, send something to the King Flex 818 Cash App.  Okay.  We're gonna have to start looking out for these brothers who are targeted by these race soldiers and they get hemmed up.  We're gonna have to let them know we got their back.  We're gonna have to stop all these people finessing the game because his bail was $75,000.  So luckily we got a bail bondsman.  It was a sister who ran a bail bonds agency and she was hella cool.  Um, she let us do the 10%, which was good.  Okay.  So I just sent 75,000, 7,500.  I'm sorry.  I just sent 7,500 there personally.  And that sister was cool enough to not have us have to get a lot of collateral.  There's another person who's working with me.  She's going to sign off on it.  And you know, that's what we got to do, man.  That's what we got to keep doing.  Again, hit the Cash App.  That's KingFlex818 on Cash App.  When brothers and sisters are getting targeted by these goddamn race soldiers, we gotta be on top of it to make sure we get them up out of these situations.  We can't let our folks, and as a young brother, he's 20 years old, and I wanted to get him out fast because when I talked to the bail bondsman, they said that he's in the hospital in the jail, so I think they in there doing some shit to that brother.  They might have touched him up a little bit, so we wanted to go ahead and get him on out as soon as possible.  And also, we're letting the police there know, hey, we're watching everything.  You know, we got folks calling up there to let them know, hey, let's not have no funny business.  You dig?  So we got to let them know.  it ain't going to be no bullshit.  Y'all not going to be in there roughing niggas up.  He's not going to be in there rotting.  Just, you know, indefinitely, we're going to get him up out of there.  You dig?  So that's how we gotta get down like that.  That's what we gotta do.  These white supremacists are on the march, they're on the loose, and they're banking on us not looking out for each other, okay?  Yeah, I saw that.  They roughed this dude up, they're pulling his hair, slapping on him, and the brother said, fuck that.  The brother defended himself, as he should, and we're going to have his back.  We're not gonna sit up and let these folks abuse our young folks like that.  Fuck that.  We're not gonna do that.  Our young folks don't deserve that.  Our children don't deserve that.  They're just sitting up beating on us whenever they feel like it.  No, we're not going to have that.  And so again, the Cash App is KingFlex818.  Dollar sign, KingFlex818.  That's the Cash App.  Dollar sign, KingFlex818.  There's another brother.  we're going to work on getting him out, out there in Georgia, where this brother had to kill some white supremacists.  They had to kill a suspected white supremacist for harassing him.  So they got that brother in jail.  They got him on a no bond.  So we're trying to see what we can do as far as lawyers to get this brother out in Georgia.  But we'll work on that when we work on that.  But today, we're getting this brother up out of that jail in Louisiana today.  Because the race soldier just ran up on him, smacking him up, grabbing his hair like he's a fucking animal.  We're not going to have that.  You know?  So shout out.  I see everybody's sending stuff to the Cash App now.  Much respect to you guys.  I really appreciate you.  And again, if you see a GoFundMe about this, just ignore it.  Just ignore it.  Just ignore these GoFundMes.  They're full of shit.  All right?  There's a lot of y'all in here.  Shout out to my brother, Nick Cannon.  Everybody likes that interview I did with Nick Cannon.  A lot of folks like that interview.  But again, if you haven't seen the video, go to my profile.  You can see the video on my profile.  This happened down in Louisiana.  Again, hopefully I get to talk to the brother today.  The Bell Bondsmen, they're on their way now.  to the jail after they get all the paperwork signed for my other folks.  They're going to get them on out now, and I'm going to get... Hopefully, I can talk to him and find out exactly what happened.  Also, if we have some lawyers down there in Louisiana, in that area, I want to say the name is Alexandria, I think.  I got to look for sure what the name of the town is, but we can also have them look into... the case while the brother's out and come up with some strategies on what this, you know, what they can do to get the charges possibly dropped or reduced or whatever.  So, again, KingFlex818, dollar sign, KingFlex818.  That's the Cash App, guys.  I'll go back live a little bit later on when I get to the crib.  But dollar sign, KingFlex818, man, if you guys want to help out, man, much respect.  I'll get back on a little bit later.  I'm driving and I can't see shit.  All right, guys. ",
