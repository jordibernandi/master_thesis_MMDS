            "text": "with this quick update.  Hi guys, this is your sister Karen Gidden in Jesus Christ.  Brothers and sisters, I am coming to you again, alright?  And I will not be tired of talking about the three days of darkness.  Some of us are so hypocritical, you know, what do I mean by that?  Some of us are so hypocritical that... When we see other plagues and stuff going on, river turning into blood, locusts in Africa and all of that, we're very quick, we're very ready to say, one of the 10 plagues of Egypt.  When it comes to the three days of darkness, it's like it's been swept underneath the carpet.  Brothers and sisters, this is a serious judgment.  I don't think people realize it is more serious than the corona because this is a judgment from the Most High.  Sitting in darkness for three days is no fun.  when you hear demonic entities outside your windows and outside your door this is no fun.  brothers and sisters some of you are already afraid of the dark and if a pin drop you know you get really panicky and really scared and all that.  so the three days of darkness it is no joke but for those of us who are in ya for those of us who walk in the light of the most high.  We don't have to worry.  We do not have to fret.  We do not have to fear because the Most High will protect us.  Now, I've done tons of videos, tons of videos on the three days of darkness and I'm coming back with another one, a vision that the Most High gave me.  This was in What date is it today?  So this was like the 1st or the 2nd, the 2nd of June, 2020.  The Most High gave me a vision concerning the three days of darkness.  In this vision, brothers and sisters, I was at my parents' house in Jamaica.  And when I was there, it was broad daylight.  Like, you know, Caribbean, when it's nice and sunny, I mean, it's so beautiful.  Like, it's so beautiful.  And I remember this was a beautiful day.  I looked in the sky.  Beautiful fluffy clouds.  You know, no chemtrailing clouds in the vision or anything.  Beautiful fluffy cloud.  Beautiful blue skies.  The parts that you can see.  Very pretty.  Sky very beautiful.  And I remember I was sitting in the front room with my parents and a couple of my siblings and my nephew and his daughter.  I haven't told him this vision, by the way.  He's gonna probably see.  My nephew and his daughter, which is my grandniece.  Oh yeah, my grandaunt actually.  My grandniece, my beautiful grandniece.  We were all sitting in the front room.  And I saw this guy, he's an angel, okay?  And I saw him putting up some curtains.  And I said to him, I went over to him and I said, what are you doing?  And he said, the three days of darkness is coming today, brothers and sisters.  It was like, it's coming today.  so I said to him okay but the sky is beautiful because the sky was so nice brothers and sisters you know was so.  obviously I know about the three days of darkness but when he said that to me because I was looking at the sky was so beautiful I was thinking really today.  and he said yes he said the three days of darkness is going to happen today.  And he said, go get your black bags and everything, whatever you can to block out the darkness that is coming.  So I remember my mom had some black bags and she began with the rest of the family just to tape up all the windows that we could tape up.  Brothers and sisters, within a split second, within a split second, the place begun to darken.  So the darkness wasn't just boom, just like that, you know, it fell, okay?  So the place begun to get dark.  It wasn't complete pitch black.  I mean, you could still see outside, you could still see the trees and all of that, but it was just the mist darkness that was falling.  And I remember brothers and sisters, this was, this is the part that really, really, really gets got me.  Whilst we're in the house, all of a sudden, all of a sudden brothers and sisters, I don't even know where this wind came from, but in the house brothers and sisters was this strong wind.  For those of you who have been in a hurricane and when you were walking, And the wind is pushing it back.  Are you trying to push?  Well, this was like 50 times stronger.  This hurricane that was in my parents' house was so, so strong.  Was so, so strong, brothers and sisters.  And I remember all of us went into a particular room.  It wasn't, the darkness was coming, mind you.  But this hurricane-like wind was just blowing through the house.  And I remember the wind was so strong.  that it literally pulled my two-year-old grandniece out of my nephew's hand, took the baby.  This wind took the baby away.  Everybody started crying, started, you know, just said, she's called Sky.  I was saying, Sky, Sky, Sky is gone.  And it was like, I said to them, So my family, don't panic.  I will go and find Skye.  And they were saying to me, Karen, the wind is so, so strong.  You cannot manage this wind.  It's just too powerful, too strong.  I said, it's fine.  I'm going to go.  And the darkness was coming, brothers and sisters.  And I remember I came out the room.  I don't know how I maneuver in this wind.  I have no idea.  I have.  no, it's like I would walk, I know that the wind was strong, but it was not affecting me.  You know, I could walk.  And I remember brothers and sisters, remember I told you that the wind took the baby and just carried the baby away.  And I remember coming out of one of the rooms where we were all hiding and I walked on the veranda.  And when I walked on the veranda, the baby was literally hanging on.  hallelujah thank you lord thank you yeah the baby was literally hanging on to the to the doorpost.  okay so the doorpost you know you got the door jam.  so she was hanging on and i saw her and i grabbed her.  and when i grabbed her i also looked in the corner uh of this veranda or porch.  some people call it veranda some people call it porch and it was my son that my five-year-old son, and I grabbed him as well, and I brought the two kids back into the room.  Brothers and sisters, as soon as I brought my two-year-old, grandniece, and my five-year-old son back into the room where all the family was, they then said to me, carrying, what is going to happen now?  And I said to them, the darkness is coming.  It will fall.  So whatever you do, you must not open the doors to no one.  You will be fine.  And I remember my mom, because my mom, she's always praying and stuff like that.  You know, she was calling on the name of Jesus Christ and all that.  She was praying really, really hard and my dad and everything like that.  And then the darkness, I saw the angel and he said, it's time.  The darkness is here.  And he went, he just disappeared.  He just literally disappeared.  And then the darkness fell.  And I'm telling you, brothers and sisters, we were sat in complete darkness, but we had peace.  Hallelujah to the Lamb of the Most High.  Hallelujah to your name.  We had peace.  We had peace.  We had peace.  And then the vision ended.  So brothers and sisters, you know, this is an event that is going to happen.  Now, my nephew and some of my brothers and sisters, they are not saved, but because they're in a Christian home, glory to your name, Lord.  This is what I pick up in my spirit.  I mean, I don't interpret visions and dream, but because they're in a Christian home, a Christian environment, which is governed by my parents, they were okay.  Hallelujah.  So it's difficult to say to people, go find a Christian home when the darkness falls because you're going to have a very small window to do what you have to do before the darkness descends, before the darkness falls.  Because remember in Exodus chapter 10, verse 21 to 23, the Bible said that Moses stretched forth his hands and the darkness fell.  so it's gonna fall like an invading army.  okay all right so to say go and drive to a christian home.  it's going to be very tricky you know.  but if you happen to be at a christian home you know.  um i want to say christian home talking those who live right and live holy in the most higher you will be okay you will.  you'll find that peace as well.  okay that sense of peace.  um.  But brothers and sisters, this three days of darkness is coming.  I cannot warn you.  I've done so much video.  Go on my playlist, please.  Go on my playlist and you will see tons of videos on the three days of darkness.  The videos there telling you what to do, what not to do.  The last video that I did, I think it was four weeks ago, I did a video.  begging plain people to get their candles and black bags whatever you know to one place so that when this darkness begins to fall you know exactly where to go you know where your stuff is.  um yeah so I I don't want to give my interpretation on anything, but I know that I've been showing in visions and I know other watch men and watch women on the wall for the Lord for, yeah, have been shown in vision that there's going to be a cosmic, display in the atmosphere in the heavens.  all right and when you see that prepare yourself because the darkness is going to come and i've seen that in my vision.  i've done videos on it cosmic display pretty pretty colors in the sky and all of that.  but brothers and sisters the fact that the wind happened before the darkness i don't know if it's going to be a physical hurricane sorry a physical hurricane or anything like that but something I don't interpret.  dreamers I'm not I'm not interpretive such.  but something is gonna happen something major is gonna happen before the three days of darkness so that we know that something is not right.  because I'm telling you this hurricane that came through the house brothers and sisters and it got the you know took my literally took the baby out of my nephew's hand.  But luckily, oh, she's gonna be a fighter, that one, because she held on, because I thought that she's gone, but she literally held on to the doorjamb.  And she was crying, poor little mind.  She was screaming, she was crying, and I got her, brought her back to her dad, and daddy was happy and everything like that.  So brothers and sisters, you know, with the angel showing up and telling me that the darkness is gonna happen today, not today, today, but in the vision, in what gonna happen, okay?  It was just gonna happen.  So I know that this is gonna happen in clear daylight.  So everybody's gonna know that the Mosiah is doing this, all right?  And not the wicked ones.  So we normally go to Amos chapter eight, verse nine and 10, excellent scripture to read where the Mosiah said, he will darken the earth.  in a clear day all right at noon.  he even gave the time.  specific is already or yeah so specific.  uh he even gave the time as well.  so we know that this is going to happen.  i am done brothers and sisters i'm done.  i'm done convincing people to believe in this.  and when i come in here And I talk about the three days of darkness.  It is not for the non-believers.  It is for those who already believe.  And it's just to help you prepare.  And to bring you back into remembrance.  Not to forget that the three days of darkness is going to happen.  Just don't know when.  Okay.  But it's an event that is coming.  And it's going to humble the world.  The whole entire world.  Brothers and sisters.  Think about it.  The whole entire world.  It's going to go pitch black.  yeah he's gonna have his way because he's gonna step out of his habitation.  hallelujah he's gonna step out of his habitation come down into the earth to punish it.  and that is why he said hide my people.  uh for a moment until the ignatiation of the lord is passed.  i think that is found in isaiah chapter 26. okay isaiah chapter 26. oh no isaiah chapter 20 verse 26 or something like that.  i'll leave it in the description box.  i'll leave those amos 8 and isaiah in the description box so you can read that for yourself but we have to use discernment.  don't don't be a hypocrite you know because it is coming and it is going to happen.  And I really feel sorry for those channels.  I really do feel sorry for those channels who have literally come against, especially channel like my channel, other channel, there's a beautiful lady, you know, sweet, sweet sister-in-law, sister Linda Courtney.  She gave a very profound, very very very very profound video on the three days of darkness and our thing nearly reaches now it's doing very very well.  it's that video and i thank god for that.  and people come against that when we do three days of darkness.  yes some people give dates and all of that but this is not about setting a date and who is right?  you know it's about warning.  as long as you take the warning and you understand and you know.  for those of you who don't believe really all you need to do is ask the Mosiah to show you.  it's in the word but don't just ask him to show you and he will.  you know it will show you one more thing.  i know some of you are going to see this video.  the first thing some of you know the doubters are going to comment oh it's a catholic prophecy.  well not coming from a Catholic point of view okay because it's biblical.  the Most High darkened Egypt for three days while the Israelites had light.  it's in Exodus chapter 10 verse 21 to 23. you can read that.  so don't come and say well it's a Catholic prophecy.  no it is biblical.  it happened in ancient Egypt.  and or you to put the Most High yeah in a box and say well he's not gonna do it again because he will.  They will do it.  And it's going to humble a whole lot of people.  It's going to be.  One of them judgment.  That's yeah.  It's going to be a tough one.  It's going to be worse than Corona.  Keep on saying that all the time.  It's going to be worse than Corona.  So I just wanted to come to you.  Brothers and sisters.  And release this vision.  Concerning yet another.  Vision.  About the three days of darkness.  So.  Be bold, be strong, be courageous.  Walk with Yah, just like Enoch.  All praises to the Most High, Yah, who lives above the heaven.  Yah eternally bless you.  I love you all, and I will see you soon.  Someday, in glory, in Jesus Christ's precious Holy Name.  Amen, amen, amen, blessings, amen. ",
