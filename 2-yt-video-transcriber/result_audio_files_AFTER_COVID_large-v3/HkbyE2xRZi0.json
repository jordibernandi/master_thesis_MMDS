            "text": "Gentlemen, great to be back with you on MGTOW Money.  Today's topic, don't be her next victim.  Before I get into that, thanks to the ongoing support from the Patreon investors in this channel and thank you guys who hit me up via PayPal, Bitcoin, based upon the last videos.  You know what men, thank you for the sincere feedback and positive support you're giving this channel.  And by the way, a big thumbs down to our good friends at YouTube here who after a year and a half have still demonetized this channel.  in other words no ads from YouTube of course despite all the traffic I've generated for them.  oh and furthermore now men they've decided now start age restricting some of the videos that I've done.  yeah you're right the same guy who's talked about ideas like oh cut up your credit cards, be careful spending money, be careful taking out loans, etc.  We're going to age restrict for young men to get that type of information.  Amazing.  All right, on topic today, don't be her next victim.  Guys, imagine this.  You're a good-looking woman.  I know, okay, I understand it's a little bit hard, but just take my word for it.  You're a good-looking, 20-something-year-old woman.  Now, I didn't say great-looking.  I didn't say you're a nine-and-a-half.  I didn't say you're a model.  But you're a good-looking woman.  All right, let's say with a lot of makeup, you're a good eight or so, eight-and-a-half.  All right, so you move to  L.A.,  and you're like millions of other women just like you.  You're young, and you're ambitious, and, of course, you want to be a quote-unquote actress.  and no you don't want to be an adult actress you want to be a quote-unquote legitimate actress because it's more important for many women to be famous not necessarily have money but simply to be famous to be recognized to get all the accolades etc.  because of course if nothing else they figure well.  fame generally leads to money and at the very least i'll get money the old-fashioned way i'll just marry an old rich guy.  So anyway, so you get invited to a Hollywood party.  Now, frankly, I've never been to a quote unquote Hollywood party, but I can imagine it's probably loaded with writers and with other actresses and actors and film producers, etc.  You know, sort of that Hollywood clique, those types of people who are all involved in the industry.  And inevitably... there's going to be a few people in there who are extremely powerful and prominent.  In other words, let's say it's a group of 20 people.  There's probably going to be four of those people.  In other words, 20% of the 20 people who are going to be the alpha people.  They are going to be the people who everyone is going to gravitate to.  and you again being an ambitious young woman that you are are going to be gravitating to one of those alpha people and in this particular case he's a movie producer.  now let me define a movie producer.  for those of you don't know this is essentially the guy who puts it all together.  he takes an idea puts it together and attempts to make it work.  he's the real entrepreneur whether it be putting together a movie a television show etc.  he is the gatekeeper for everything.  so you definitely want to get with him and more importantly you want to get with somebody who's been successful.  so again you got this alpha guy who's been very successful and you've already sort of identified him and he's already got people hanging around him etc.  now if He's not, frankly, the most attractive guy in the world at all.  As a matter of fact, he's very, let's say conventionally, very unattractive.  And he doesn't have a very good personality.  But you know what?  Who cares?  Because remember what your ambition is.  Your ambition is to, of course, get into the movies.  And again, you've got to go through his gatekeeper to do it.  So what happens when you get with this guy?  And we're going to continue the story in just a second.  A quick word from our sponsor.  Okay, I get it.  I know that many of you are making good money or at least want to in cryptos.  However, there's another way that you might have actually heard of that you can make money in.  And that's in the stock market.  Has anybody mentioned that the U.S.  stock market has traded just recently at all-time highs?  And oh, by the way, did anybody see just last week Sprint?  You know Sprint, the cell phone carrier?  Oh, their stock was up in one day.  Get ready, gentlemen.  70%.  I said 7-0%.  Oh, by the way, Webull, who is the sponsor of this ad, gave me free shares in Sprint previously.  prior to it going up 70%.  Men, this can be you.  You can make money in the stock market.  I don't want to say easily, but you can make money.  And the first thing, if nothing else, you got to open an account.  Go to the link right now in the video description.  Open an account with Webull.  It costs nothing.  You will get one free share of stock just for opening an account if you're 18 years old and an American citizen.  Period.  End of story.  If you add in a dollar, one US dollar, you will get a second share of stock.  That's right.  So you'll end up with two shares of stock just by going to the video link today, right now, opening an account with Webull.  Men, join the dozens, hundreds of other men that are on this channel that have already taken advantage of this opportunity.  Go to the video description right now.  Open up your Webull account.  You have no reason, no excuses to stop.  Back on topic.  All right, so there you are.  You're feeling good.  You caught his eye.  You got a good conversation, a good rapport going with this guy.  He kind of looks like an ogre, but you know, he has kind of a twinkle in his eye and whatever.  and And he's got a lot of contacts, of course, and he's done a lot of successful movies and television series.  And that, of course, is the most important thing because that's what you want.  He's your gateway.  So needless to say, he says, hey, you know, why don't you swing by my hotel?  You know, I'm staying right down a couple of blocks down the street and stop by and have a couple of drinks and whatever.  Well, of course.  What else would you say?  I mean, who wouldn't?  I mean, just because this guy's 40 years older than you and just because you heard a few stories about he's had a few flings with women and whatever.  But hey, you know, it's all good, right?  It's all, I mean, it's all, it's going to be strictly professional, right?  Okay.  so you go arm and arm with him down to the walk down to the hotel and you're feeling good.  and wow this is going to be great.  and you know this guy he's already talking about different series he might be able to place me in etc.  and projects that he's working on.  you know the juices are flowing etc.  juices in a lot of different ways are flowing i'm sure.  so needless to say you stop at the hotel bar have a quick drink you're feeling good.  he says hey you know let me let me take you up to my room and show you a couple of things.  i've got some paperwork and a script that i'm going over etc.  you might want to take a look at it.  well of course i mean this is even better.  he's bringing me right up to show me a script go over projects etc.  gentlemen let's put aside here for just a second so again setting the scene here.  you're twenty-something woman you meet a stranger at a party and now you're heading to his hotel room.  hmm okay continuing on with the story.  so you go up to the hotel room you're reviewing the script and he starts making some advances on you physical advances of course I'm talking about and you know what You don't resist.  Yeah, you're feeling pretty good.  And by the way, you're thinking in the back of your head, hey, if nothing else, this will probably lead to something else better in my future.  You know, I mean, he's got these projects going.  He's got a movie that he's looking to cast somebody for.  He said, I'd be perfect, etc.  Wow, this is really looking good.  continuing on so the days go by the weeks go by.  you had a nice encounter a fling if you will of course it was just quote a fling.  in his hotel room.  you meet up with him multiple other times and he of course is discussing various projects and how you're going to fit in with him and various things he's doing in the future and actually he's actually named a role that you would be quote unquote perfect for and things are looking great.  however something happens something turns who knows what it is?  but needless to say oh hey he stops returning my call.  what's going on here?  well i'm gonna send him.  i'm gonna send him 27 text messages.  why aren't you returning my cold?  what's wrong?  why are you mad at me etc.  and for whatever reason he's dropped you.  he's dropped you like a hot potato.  you're agonized you're you're you're you.  you feel quote-unquote used and disrespected and you're in tears and you're telling everyone how horrible this situation is etc.  where are you?  are you telling everyone?  And later on, a few years later, as the years go by, after you had no contact with this movie director, all of a sudden you hear about the other.  women are complaining about him, alleged sexual assaults, and alleged taking advantage of them, and alleged... criminal charges regarding assault, etc.  And so needless to say, you're thinking, yeah, yeah, that was me.  That was me too.  I too.  I was a victim, right?  He did that to me, right?  Hmm.  Is that actually what happened?  Is that actually what happened here?  Did he actually take advantage of you?  Did he take advantage of you for example when you got involved with him in a threesome by your own admission?  Did he take advantage of you when you told a friend, a personal friend that you considered him, and by the way, you told this personal friend this multiple times, that he was your quote-unquote soulmate, quote-unquote, and that you had nothing but great, and by the way, you had nothing but great things to say about the guy, and you were involved with him multiple times.  many, many times over a long period of time.  And you actually corresponded with him multiple times in a positive fashion.  Gentlemen, the story that I've given you is partially fiction and partially true.  This is straight out of the court transcripts, as well as I'll include a link to the movie producer.  in this case that I'm specifically talking about is a gentleman named Harvey Weinstein.  You probably have heard about this.  This is a serious criminal trial going on in New York City literally right now.  I think it just recently went to the jury.  By the way, Harvey Weinstein, for example, put together films like Kill Bill, Pulp Fiction.  He was extremely popular.  popular in terms of in the movie making as well as television industry.  and the person the young woman who i was talking about is a woman named jessica man.  again go to the video description.  i'm including a link to the article.  you can decide for yourself what's the point to this whole story here?  men what can you take away from this.  listen very carefully because there are three points that apply to your life.  one don't date women that are within your office within your social circle that are within your school that are within your workplace etc.  i highly recommend you stay away from them.  too many men young men college-age men even high school men but certainly college-age men have been had accusations thrown at them of sexual assault sexual harassment, etc.  And so many of these cases, I am not saying all, but so many of these cases have turned out to be he said, she said, if not outright frauds.  That they were actually, that the alleged victim ended up retracting their statement saying, yeah, I made the whole thing up.  You don't want this to happen to you.  So what I would recommend is, whether you're at school or work, again, you want to definitely keep your social life, if you will.  If you're deciding to get involved with women in the Western world, You keep those areas completely separate.  I can only speak from my own personal experience, whether it be luck or happenstance.  That's exactly what I did.  No, it's not necessarily easy.  In other words, it is easier to just meet people at your own school, your own workplace, and end up involved with them.  But I can tell you, in the long run, it'll end up hurting you.  Two, when around women who you're not related to, especially... if you're in a professional environment if you're at the workplace whatever avoid avoid i can't emphasize enough.  avoid any type of one-on-one type situations where you're alone being with them.  i should have thrown it in also in if you're in college or whatever.  I would not have a woman back in my dorm room, and certainly I would not have the door shut, etc.  For me, today in particular, I'll use the Mike Pence rule.  You know, the Vice President of the United States today, he's got a rule.  He says when he goes out to dinner with a woman, he's always going with a second person there.  I think that should apply to you.  In other words, you're always going to keep the door open when it's just you and a woman.  Thirdly, this is most important.  Listen carefully.  Do you trust a child?  If you were to share a secret, would you trust that that child is going to keep that secret?  My point is that just like you probably wouldn't trust a child to quote keep a secret, there is nothing that you can trust a woman to keep secret.  The point is that if you've got something really important, even if you get a legal document that they sign, a quote unquote NDA, non-disclosure agreement, that says they won't disclose any of this.  you can almost be virtually guaranteed that your loyalty is a one-way street.  In other words, you might be loyal to them, but you can almost be assured they are not going to be loyal to you.  I've done videos in the past about this, for example, with Stormy Daniels.  Don't ever expect a woman to keep a secret.  Don't ever expect a woman to, quote, keep her end of the agreement, keep her side of the bargain.  to keep a contract.  again I'm speaking from personal experience on that one.  women are very similar in many ways like children.  in other words a woman at age 15 is not that much different than that woman is at age 45 unlike men who are very different from age 15 to 45. they are very egocentric and very very very tied in with themselves regardless of their age and they will do whatever is necessary to protect themselves however they perceive they need to protect themselves.  take my word for it gentlemen don't share secrets with women.  gentlemen as always i hope you found this profitable.  hit the like button.  if you did john galt out.
