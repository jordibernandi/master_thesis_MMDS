            "text": "Praise be Jesus Christ.  My dear brothers and sisters, we are in a spiritual battle.  There's a battle going on for your soul.  And one of the things that the demons do not want you to do is to hope.  In scripture, it says that everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.  And the Lord Jesus says, I will not turn away anyone who comes to me.  And so there are times when the demons will attack us.  They'll harass us.  And one of the things that the devil loves to do is to accuse us, to cause us to feel shame, to feel inadequate.  The devil wants us to despair, to think that there is no hope.  And some of what the devil throws at us, there's some truth to it.  Yes, we've sinned.  Yes, we've messed We've let the Lord down.  All of that, there's some truth to it, but there's more truth.  The truth is the Lord loves us with an everlasting love.  We're precious in his eyes and he will never forsake us.  He loves us.  He's merciful.  And so when we find ourselves under attack, maybe even under oppression from the devil who's accusing us, trying to get us to despair, Okay, three prayers that will burn the demons.  Number one, the Jesus prayer.  You need to know the Jesus prayer.  The Jesus prayer needs to be part of your spirit.  You need to pray the Jesus prayer enough that it comes spontaneously to you when you're under attack.  What's the Jesus prayer?  Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner.  second prayer very powerful is the prayer of trust.  simply put to say jesus i trust in you.  so when you're under attack you begin to repeat jesus i trust in you jesus i trust in you jesus i trust in you and you can say this prayer in different ways.  you can say precious blood of jesus i trust in you.  wounds of christ.  this trust, this appealing to the wounds of Christ.  This calling on the name of Jesus will burn the demons, they will flee.  And then thirdly, very powerful prayer, to simply pray, Father, thy will be done.  Because you see, when the demons are attacking us, they're trying to impose their will.  They'll say, you're going to burn in hell.  There's no hope for you.  You're going to be ruined.  Well, that's the demon's will.  That's not God's will.  And God is almighty.  He decides.  And because we know he loves us, to the will of our Abba Father in heaven.  And so when the demons are trying to impose their diabolical will on us, we can respond by saying, Abba Father, Thy will be done.  Thy will be done.  Thy will be done, Father.  These prayers need to be prayed with confidence, with childlike trust.  not freaking out because the devil's attacking us, but to confidently respond, Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy on me, a sinner.  Jesus, I trust in you.  Abba, Father, thy will be done.  Viva Christi. ",
