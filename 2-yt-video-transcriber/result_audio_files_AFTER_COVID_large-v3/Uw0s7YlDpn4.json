            "text": "Shalom, shalom, brothers and sisters, it's Pastor Tim.  This is going to be a little bit of a heavy message.  I want to remind everyone, I want to set the stage that while I listen to what the Lord's telling me and pray every day, Holy Spirit, lead me into what to share, not to share, what you want me to share.  I'm saying this to believers.  This is not something to get us overwhelmed or paranoid.  It just is truth.  And we know these things are going to happen according to the word of God.  So we occupy and redeem the time.  And while we are in the final moments of the end of days, we are at the end of a dispensation.  We are seeing the veil is thinning.  We are transitioning.  When I say that, know that as the world becomes darker, we should shine brighter.  The believers, and if you don't know what I mean by that, the ABCs of salvation is in the description box.  Believe on the Lord Jesus, his death, burial, and resurrection, and you will be saved.  So, Abba took me, Holy Spirit led me this morning to Genesis 6-5.  And I'm going to read it for you from the King James.  And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth.  And that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.  And the Lord spoke clearly to me, the cup of iniquity is full.  Meaning, we are close to that time.  When the wrath of God, now remember, God is love.  1.  John 4, 7, and 8 tells us that.  Beloved, let us love one another, for love is of God, and everyone that loveth is born of God and knoweth God.  He that loveth not knoweth not God, for God.  Is love.  Love is a person.  God is love.  Now God's love is perfect.  And he loves you fiercely and passionately.  Equally, God's wrath is perfect.  And it is fierce and passionate.  And the day is coming when his wrath is about to be poured out on the planet.  Now we know the season we're in.  We are not setting a date, nor have I ever.  And I say to believers, we occupy and redeem the time.  We should be the people with the most joy, the most peace, displaying the most love.  Hallelujah.  Because we're born again.  Because greater is he who's in us than he who's in the world.  The nanosecond you believed.  That Jesus, Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus Messiah, God the Son, the Son of God, always existed, left glory, laid down his glory, was born of a virgin, wrapped in flesh, lived a perfect life and never sinned, and shed his precious blood on the cross to pay the debt for our sins once and for all.  He died for our sins, was buried, and on the third day rose from the dead.  The nanosecond, less than nanosecond.  You believed on him.  You are saved, sealed, and sanctified until the day of redemption.  Done deal.  Heaven bound.  Rapture ready.  Salvation is an event, not a process.  So keep that in mind because for the believer, we rejoice as we see the day approaching.  Hallelujah.  And there's an urgency, but that urgency isn't to be overwhelmed.  That urgency is to boldly share the gospel.  Hallelujah.  And look up and rejoice for our redemption draws nigh.  Well, when the Lord showed me that this verse and said the cup of iniquity is full.  Things are moving quickly and are happening.  So I pray that the urgency will be there.  Because the Lord said, just like in those days, just like in the days of Noah, we are seeing it.  We are seeing it.  Right now, there is a remnant.  There are believers.  I'm telling you, the wickedness is pervasive.  I'm going to name two things.  Human trafficking.  Do you know there are those?  There was a woman protesting the other day and I stopped and said, what are you protesting?  I can't even say the words because I'm going to share this on YouTube as well.  I can't, on Patreon I can, but I'm going to share this.  I can't even say the words.  I can't hashtag it because if I did, it would clearly go down and this channel may go out.  And this woman said, everything they've tried to do on social media has been shut down and it was in regard, and I'm going to give you two things.  It's in regard to one of them, but I can't use the words they use.  Seriously.  Which is sad.  Abortion.  Like, this is horrific.  The Holocaust on the unborn.  in the United States alone this year, at a conservative number, we're looking at one and a half million babies will be horrifically murdered.  That's right.  In China, I reported yesterday.  This is true.  Babies born to religious families and minorities, the hospitals have been told to terminate them before and after birth.  This is real.  This is happening.  I did it in the news report.  That would have been on Patreon.  But anyway, you're hearing it.  And this is horrific.  And then human trafficking.  What a travesty.  And there are a lot of hands involved in these things.  It's wicked.  It's wicked.  And that's out there on the forefront.  My wife has long liked her movies.  I'm not even going to name the channel.  I'm not going to go there.  But it was one, I call it non-redemptive.  It's not evil.  They would have these, not pornography.  Please don't let people tell you that.  But, you know, I call them the girly movies.  She would say, oh, will you watch this with me?  So predictable.  You know that they're going to fall in love.  You know they're going to get married.  Often there's a pet involved.  You guys know what I mean.  Well, they've altered.  They long had things.  And I used to say a lot of people, and a lot of people I've talked about in Christendom, believers, especially the ladies, would watch those movies because they said they just were light and emotional and just had a happy ending.  And I don't have anything against that.  But now they've moved.  They've caved to the LGBTQRX40WXT, whatever you call it, because they keep adding to it.  And I'm not making fun of anyone.  You guys know that we've done videos.  Like our dear brother Todd Randy, who I can't wait to do another video with.  Todd, if you're watching this, and Todd will tell you, we love everyone and God loves everyone.  And Todd came out of that lifestyle and for, I think, 16 years now, 17 years, has been happily married to his wife.  And God is faithful.  And he gives his testimony.  It's on YouTube.  It's not about that, but it's about calling what's right, right and what's wrong, wrong.  And they cave to the political.  And so that's just one example.  But I'm going to go back to the horrific murder of the unborn.  And human trafficking is horrible.  And these very videos, videos like this, I've had sermons taken down, censored, not just on YouTube, but on Facebook and censored on Twitter.  Brothers and sister.  And then there are people say, no, he's not.  Yeah, I am.  And there are many who have witnessed it.  Many on the team could come on.  Maybe we'll do a call.  But you know what?  We're not going to answer those mocking and scoffing.  It's just a reality.  If you don't believe censorship is going on to those who are conservative and Christian values, you're just.  your head has been in the sand.  It is happening and happening all the time and at a rapid rate.  Well, the Lord showed me that the cup of iniquity is full.  Brothers and sisters, we are in the final moments of the end of days.  And I didn't want to share this, but I've shared this before.  When you look at the prophecy, Ezekiel's prophecies, where's America when those nations that the prophet Ezekiel talks about, Russia, Togarmah, Turkey, Persia, Iran, Kush and Put is Sudan and Libya, probably a little bit of Ethiopia and by proxy and Turkey's involvement and Russia's involvement in Sudan and Libya.  And though they have.  military forces from there.  They're represented all in Syria, north of Israel.  And the Bible tells us that they are going to come down against Israel, but God himself will protect Israel.  I don't know that.  we'll see that.  We could be out of here before then.  We may see it.  I don't know.  I don't know the timing of that.  I've often been asked that, and I answer that.  But I do know this.  America isn't mentioned.  America's not there.  Where's America?  I've had the rapture dreams that I've shared.  As we go up, they come down.  I've often said, I don't know what they are.  They could be asteroids.  They could be fallen angels.  It could be nuclear, whatever it is.  As we go up, they come down.  And I will tell you, I'm just going to say it.  In the future, What I've seen.  And what the Lord is showing me.  Now I'm not talking about.  While we're occupying and redeeming.  Now.  So don't become fearful.  But America's toast.  That's all I can tell you.  America's toast.  Saying that.  I'm sharing that.  Because I've been led to.  I don't know when that is.  And we occupy and redeem the times.  We have authority as believers, and we have an opportunity right now.  However long that is, we have an opportunity.  God has a destiny, a ministry, an anointing for each and every believer.  Walk in that.  Walk with joy and peace and love.  The Bible has shown us, listen, we know what's going to come.  And things are going to keep moving.  In this end time scenario.  But God.  And we don't want to join the enemy.  In helping to.  Listen.  I've said this many times.  The church.  The ecclesia.  That means us.  All believers.  From Jews or the nations.  We make up the musterion.  1 Corinthians 10.  It says give no offense.  Neither to the Jew.  nor the nations, we translate that Gentiles, nor the ecclesia, the church, the called out ones, the body of Christ, the bride of Christ.  Anyone from Jews or nations who believes on the Son of God, his precious blood shed, redeeming us, paying the debt for our sins, past, present, and future, an event, the nanosecond you believe.  he died for our sins, was buried, And on the third day rose from the dead.  You are born again.  Indwelt with Holy Spirit.  Saved, sealed and sanctified.  Boom.  Done deal.  Rapture ready.  And heaven bound.  Hallelujah.  And so we are in that season.  We as the church.  As the ekklesia, the called-out ones, the bride of Christ, we are eager for the bridegroom to come and get us.  The rapture, we call it.  In the Bible, it's the Greek word harpazo, and it means to be caught up.  It's like a fear snatching away.  It's so quick.  In the twinkling of an eye, 1 Thessalonians 4, 16-18 references it, as well as 1 Corinthians 15, 50-53, and there are other scriptures.  And in the description box, there is a link to Brother Keegan's website where he has fantastic information.  In fact, I know Olive Tree Ministries, Jan Markell has shared two or three now of his articles.  Brother Keegan is on the money with it.  So it's a great resource.  He is a blessing, not only to my channel, but I know to Brother Chad at WatchmanOnTheWall88, to Brother Barry Scarborough, to... Brother Keegan is one of our prophecy reporters along with Sister Ashley.  And we love you guys and appreciate you.  So that link is there.  Use that resource.  And so you've got the church.  The bride is eager.  The spirit and the bride.  Even so, come Lord Jesus.  The bridegroom.  Our Mashiach.  Our Lord.  Our Savior.  Jesus Christ.  Yeshua.  Yeshua.  He's eager to come get his bride.  And we are going to be spared the wrath that is to come in the tribulation period.  The Bible is very clear on that.  Well, so you've got the bridegroom and the bride are ready.  But there's another thing.  that really is eager for us to be removed.  Who would that be?  Ha-Satan, Satan, the accuser of the brethren, the devil.  He is eager for us to go too.  And so he's trying to, often I've seen where the enemy, and the Lord has shown me, and I pray, where he's trying to push an agenda.  God is sovereign.  He has a timing.  So we want to be prayerful and mindful and occupy and redeem the time.  And corporately, as the body of Christ, the Bible is clear.  Why?  What's our purpose right now?  To worship God in spirit and in truth.  Build one another, the brethren, that's brothers and sisters in Christ, up in the faith.  Not tear one another down.  Not join the accuser and accusation against your brothers and sisters.  Whether it's... People say, well, it's true what I'm sharing.  Even if it is, you're sharing it to condemn and accuse.  Don't do that.  Build up.  Pray for.  I'm not going into the church discipline thing and encouraging.  You know, we should all be correctable and teachable.  Absolutely.  That's not what I'm talking about.  I'm talking about the lies, the criticism, the condemnation, and even things that may be true.  People coming and condemning and divide.  Don't do that.  Let's build one another up.  Do you realize that if they're believers, that's your brother and sister in Christ.  And when you come against that, you're coming against yourself because we're part of one body, the body of Christ.  So we worship God in spirit and in truth.  Build one another up in the faith.  And then reach out to the lost with the gospel.  1 Corinthians 15, 1-4.  Christ died for our sins, was buried, and on the third day rose from the dead.  Boom!  The nanosecond they believe.  Solo fide.  Faith plus nothing equals salvation and eternal security.  Ephesians 2.8.9.  For by grace are we saved through faith, and that not of ourselves.  It is the gift of God, not by works, lest any man should boast.  Oh, praise God for his amazing grace.  The precious blood of Jesus that was shed for us.  His death, burial, and resurrection.  Oh, thank you, Jesus.  It's just, it never gets old.  Well, I wanted to share that with you, that what the Lord gave me, the cup of iniquity is full, and the rest of it, and there you have it.  God loves you fiercely and passionately.  I love you too.  If you haven't seen, we have a number now.  We've expanded the support that we have from the YouTube and the Patreon channels.  There is a number that you can call.  Now remember, we still have the prayer request.  go to Sister Kathy.  Kathy, we love you.  Praying for Sister Kathy.  Continue to pray for her health.  She has continued to be part of this ministry.  And we just love and appreciate her.  She takes the prayer request.  Many of you have experienced the impact of Sister Kathy on all of our lives.  And we just love and appreciate her.  And we're believing God for complete restoration.  And, well, that's it.  I just want to remind you, greater is he who's in you than he who's in the world.  And the same spirit that raised Jesus from the dead abides in you.  Shalom, shalom.  Shalom, aleichem.  And have an awesome rest of your day. ",
