Years ago, Jesse Jackson gave Donald Trump an award for the economic opportunities he created for black people.  In Palm Beach, Florida, Donald Trump led the crusade to allow blacks and Jews into private clubs and resorts.  One of the first things he did as president was bring the Office of Historically Black Colleges and Universities into the White House so that it could get proper attention and financial support.  Before the pandemic, African American unemployment was at an all-time low.  President Trump accomplished prison reform.  He created incentives to encourage investors to become involved with economically deprived areas of America.  He strongly supports school choice, fully recognizing that no matter what circumstances a person is born into, they can achieve success with a good education. ",
