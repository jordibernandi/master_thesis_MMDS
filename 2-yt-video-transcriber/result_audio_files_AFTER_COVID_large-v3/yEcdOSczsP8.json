            "text": "Welcome to Sergeant Dorsey Speaks.  I'm a retired 20 year veteran sergeant of the Los Angeles Police Department, and I am not afraid to pull the covers back, expose that thin blue line, and talk to you honestly and candidly about police training, police policy, and a whole lot about police culture.  Welcome family to Sergeant Dorsey Speaks across all of my social media platforms, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Instagram.  I am here to talk to you about the latest video that has gone viral.  I had to take a day or two before I could get to it because of the tragic loss of life in the person of George Big Floyd Floyd.  So there's another viral video that's making its rounds and this involves white woman by the name of Amy Cooper.  pronounced Kieran.  This video went viral when Karen Cooper, Amy, Karen Cooper, decided that she would try to weaponize the NYPD on a black man who was in a dog park.  Well, actually it wasn't a dog park, but she was in there with her dog.  And so not on a leash, in violation.  And the black man involved name is also surname Cooper, Christian, Christian Cooper, no relation.  And he merely asked Karen, hey, could you put your dog on a leash?  And she lost it, family.  She lost it.  And so I'm going to share with you the video of Amy Karen Cooper as she threatens to weaponize the NYPD against Christian Cooper.  And listen, this is really a big deal and a sensitive area for me because you've seen like I've seen several videos of how NYPD gets down.  And so they don't really need a reason to cause hurt, harm or danger to a black man.  And so the mere threat of calling the NYPD on a black man who's doing nothing wrong, who asked her because she was doing something wrong to put her damn dog on a leash.  She tried it.  Watch the video. ",

            "text": "So listen, family, let's not pretend that... Karen didn't know what she was doing when she called the police.  And so she's made a really pitiful and probably partly tearful apology.  You know, she meant this man no harm and she's really sorry.  Well, she's sorry that there's a backlash and not in her favor because now she's lost her job.  She was a VP over at Franklin Templeton in New York and they fired her because they said they have no tolerance for foolishness or racism.  And in addition to that, Now, the district attorney is also allegedly looking into the incident, along with New York City's Commission on Human Rights.  Now, the New York City Commission on Human Rights is an agency that has the authority to find violators Amy and also award damages to victims.  Christian HR sent a letter to Amy asking for her cooperation in their investigation.  Should she fail to cooperate?  The next step could be litigation.  The commission is also seeking restorative justice in this matter.  Now listen on this day, little Karen over there, she got the right black man in terms of somebody who had the presence of mind to start recording when she threatened to weaponize the NYPD so that there would be a record other than her own, because you know, it doesn't matter family now, whether it's police officers or just plain old garden variety, white folks, they get the benefit of the doubt.  And so unless we have evidence to refute their foolishness, their word could very well rule the day.  And thankfully, thankfully, um, there were no negative repercussions for Mr.  Cooper.  Now he's a good guy.  She's lucky because he says in a written statement, well, either written or on TV, he said that he's not looking to ruin this young lady's, uh, entire life based on a, you know, brain fart, my words, not Christians that she had.  And so listen, if it were me, And probably a couple of you, we'd be going, you know, for the juggler, right?  And rightfully so, because this thing could have turned out so differently.  And so let me just tell you how amazing, how amazing Christian Cooper is.  This is Christian Cooper, a Harvard graduate.  And not only that, he's an avid birdwatcher, which brought him out in the first place.  Christian Cooper is a New York based editor who has formerly worked for Marvel comic books as an editor and edited X-Men collections.  Christian Cooper is also a member of the Audubon society, and he is the past president back in 1980 of the Orinthological.  currently Christian Cooper is a senior biomedical editor at health science communications or communicators.  One of the, one or the other.  Um, he's a good dude.  He's upstanding, he's forthright and um, he's not looking to do this woman any harm unlike what she was trying to do to him.  So, um, It's not over.  I think black Twitter is gonna continue to drag young Amy Cooper for a day or two more.  And listen, certainly, I don't know if there are gonna be any criminal repercussions.  I do know that there are certain states, certain cities who have ordinances that speak to folks who call the police on us when we're living while black.  walking while black, driving while black, in school while black, and evidently bird watching while black.  So I don't know if New York is actually going to pursue any kind of criminal charge.  The fact that the district attorney says they're looking into the matter means there's a slight possibility.  And so I guess if there continues to be much uproar, that's possible.  Now, you know that the death The murder of George Big Floyd Floyd is certainly dominating most conversations right now.  And I hope this incident doesn't get swept under the rug, because while Christian Cooper did not suffer any injury, police officers didn't come and harass him and.  Create a situation.  I don't think Christian is the kind of guy who would have allowed it to escalate to a use of force because he just seems too sensible to me.  But nonetheless, it's a possibility.  And listen, what is Karen going to learn from this if she doesn't suffer something other than just losing her job?  Now, I don't know this to be true because.  I haven't seen evidence of it, but someone did share with me on my social media platform that she has already, Karen Cooper, has already been offered a job at Bank of America.  I don't know if it's true.  I haven't been able to validate and authenticate that information.  I have not seen it personally.  I just heard.  But, you know, she does enjoy the pale privilege, much like police officers who... are engaged in misbehavior and bad conduct.  They live to offend again.  And so I'm concerned that Amy Cooper may not really have learned her lesson.  if she doesn't have to undergo something more than just a relocation, a change of occupation, if you will.  So that's going on family.  That's why it's so important that we continue to have the talk with all members of the of our family about what to do when you're not only now confronted by police, but by civilians who deputize themselves, frustrated wannabe cops.  And now let's add to the group white folks who just don't like us because we're here and want to weaponize their local police department, call them, create a situation.  You heard this heifer, she was huffing and puffing and out of breath and said that he was scaring me and all sorts of foolishness.  It's a thing and we need to know what to do if and when we ever find ourselves in that situation.  And while many of us, you know, anybody north of 40 may know what to do, but do your young people know what to do?  Have a conversation with your millennials and make sure that they know what to do because this thing could have actually gone sideways if Christian Cooper hadn't been such an upstanding gentleman.  That's it for now family.  I will see you again soon.  Until then, be good and be safe. ",
