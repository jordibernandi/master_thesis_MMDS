            "text": "Well, this is interesting.  Yesterday, I've had basically, since I bought the camper, it's had pretty weak house batteries.  And then yesterday, I filled all of the cells.  There were a couple that were low.  But of course, the hardest one to get to was totally empty.  I knew there was going to be a problem.  Well, chances are there would be.  Because, you know, corrosion builds up on a plate when it's dry.  And if it boiled so much that it's dry, that's an indication that it's a bad battery.  These things are about six years old, and that's about all they last anyway.  And as you can see, the main, this battery is like.  pretty bad, 112 degrees.  But right where the bad cell was, we got like 158 degrees.  No wonder the refrigerator and the carbon monoxide alarm was going off.  This thing must have been venting hydrogen into the camper.  So I hooked up my spare house battery that I bought in Arizona.  It was like a booster battery.  And then I basically, so I just pushed in the little battery switch.  You can see where the laser is right there.  That's actually a switch.  So you push it in and then the batteries here are cut off.  So I'm going to pull the batteries and I'm thinking I'm going to upgrade to 6 volt, two 6 volt batteries in series and I can get more amp hours and a deeper cycle, more of a deep cycle effect out of these.  I'll have to rearrange the cables a bit.  Easy, easily done.  So, oh well, more delays because this camper isn't going anywhere like this.  All righty.  This is just an interesting problem with the house batteries.  So, yeah, and of course, when you fill the batteries, you know, you should fill all of them instead of just the easy ones to reach to.  Silly.  Okay, and don't get married. ",
