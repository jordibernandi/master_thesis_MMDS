And we have received correspondence from people all over the world expressing their concerns about waking up and finding out they're married to a Jehovah's Witness or whatever.  And they just don't know what to do with their life because it just seems like their whole world has been turned upside down. ",

            "text": "Okay, so there's three different scenarios that I'm going to give you about a Jehovah's Witness.  Okay, so the first scenario is a person that was raised as one of Jehovah's Witnesses, and they're ready to get with the Jehovah's Witness program, but they realize that there's not that many marriage partners in the organization.  So what they're going to do is they're going to snag this unsuspecting person that's not one of Jehovah's Witnesses and hope to get married, And then when they're married and they decide to get baptized now, they're not considered marrying out of the truth.  The other scenario that I'm going to talk about is the individual that has been disciplined by the Jehovah's Witnesses and they are disfellowshipped.  And they have to stop living in sin as it were, because this is a lot of the people we talk to people that I got to get myself together.  I got to get back to the witnesses.  And so they may already be married to their significant other or, um, They realize that they need to get married because they're living in sin.  And so that's the second one.  And they're going back to the kingdom home.  And then there's a rather rare occasion when you'll get a person that's just already a witness.  They haven't been disciplined or anything like that.  But they just go out and they marry somebody that's not one of Jehovah's Witnesses.  So... Those are the three types of scenarios that I have personally seen in my involvement in this religion.  So for those of you who are married to Jehovah's Witnesses, because we have received email correspondence from these types of scenarios.  We've had people that were married to a Jehovah's Witness and that person decides they want to practice their religion again.  We have a situation where individuals are dating a Jehovah's Witness and they are committed.  Their heart is committed to this person and they're in love with this witness, but they've been given an ultimatum that if they don't follow them into this religion, then they can't have anything to do with them.  So they don't want to continue in the relationship.  And then we also just have people who have family members that are dating a Jehovah's Witness and they're concerned about their loved ones getting involved, getting sucked into the religion because they decided themselves that they were going to go and research about the Jehovah's Witnesses to help their family member.  But then their family members like, oh no, I love this person.  My heart is tied up into this relationship.  And so now they don't want to hear anything that their family member has to say about Jehovah's Witnesses because they don't want to lose their relationship with this person.  That's a witness that's trying to go back to the Kingdom Hall.  So this is the other types of scenarios that we're getting.  But the bottom line is the outcome is pretty much the same.  No matter what scenario you find yourself in someone is going to be hurt.  Because of the decision that Jehovah's Witnesses want to make sure that they go back to the Kingdom Hall.  And so someone's feelings are going to get hurt because if the Jehovah's Witness cuts the person off, then that person is going to be hurting because they're losing this relationship.  If a person goes back to the kingdom hall, they're already married to a person that's not a witness, and they decide to go back to the kingdom hall and start practicing, well, their spouse, their whole life changes because now no holidays, no birthdays, and just the life just changes.  Where this one individual that wrote us talked about how He and his wife, they had a nice life.  They had good friends.  They celebrated the holidays with his family, and life was good.  And then all of a sudden, his wife comes home and says, I'm going back to the Kingdom Hall, and I'm going to serve Jehovah.  And so now all of that has changed.  Now she doesn't want to have anything to do with their old friends anymore, and he just doesn't understand what's going on.  Because most people don't know that.  One lady who's living with a man who... The man is saying, if we don't get married, I got to move out.  She's just thinking that the Jehovah's Witness religion is just a regular religion.  She has no idea what she's up against.  And he wants to marry her.  And so she doesn't realize that because he's going to be the head of her house.  She's going to be in a mess because now she's going to have to deal with this submission thing.  And he's already told her that there's two friends that she has right now that she's not allowed to talk to anymore.  So it's already starting.  It's already starting.  And so when you're dealing with people's livelihood, when you're dealing with people's heart, pulling at their heartstrings, Because you're trying to take away something that they love all for a belief system.  You know that something's wrong with that because this just doesn't happen in a normal world.  In a normal world, people are allowed to find the love of their life and be with that person without any strings attached.  But with Jehovah's Witnesses, that's why we're doing these videos, is because you need to understand what it's all about.  The Jehovah's Witness religion is not all about Going to church.  It's not just about serving God.  It's not just about being in some building and getting instruction and reading the Bible.  It's not about that.  Being a Jehovah's Witness is a way of life.  It's a 24-hour thing.  You're always on the clock.  You always have to answer to somebody because of your actions.  No matter what a Jehovah's Witness thinks or feels, they know that if they are doing something questionable, something that really ain't even questionable, something as simple as, I want to take a couple of classes in a college, or I want to work at this military installation over here that's just making some parts for a cruise ship, Or I'm going to say happy birthday to my 99-year-old grandmother.  Or I'm going to just say, you know, happy holidays to somebody at the grocery store.  Or tell somebody bless you when they sneeze or something like that.  This is what you're dealing with.  You're not just dealing with a person that's going to church.  You're dealing with a whole lot of stuff, you know.  And so... You know, these Jehovah's Witness women, a lot of them are Witness women, but not all of them are Witness women, but a lot of them are.  And so they're used to the submission thing.  They're used to being humble before a man.  And so when a lot of these men, they meet these Jehovah's Witness women, and they're like, I ain't never met a woman like this before.  I like this woman.  And so they don't realize that she done got some special training somewhere, And that's at the kingdom hall telling her to sit down, shut up, and not be talking back to some man.  So now this man, he thinks, oh, wow, I got a really nice woman on my hands.  And then all of a sudden she decides, I'm going to invoke this Jehovah's Witness thing in my life again.  I'm going back to the kingdom hall.  And so now all of a sudden she's back at the kingdom hall.  But what this man doesn't realize is that she's going to be more loyal and listen to these brothers and these elders and stuff.  than she is to him.  so it's like what happened to this woman that was so humble and and following what i said now all that don't change now because now she got to get with the real program and the real program means she got to follow us in the washington awake magazines because You don't count.  You're not that important anymore.  See?  So you don't know that.  So you got to do your research.  And not only that, but let me say this.  It would just be so nice because of all the correspondence that we get from people that are talking and dating these Jehovah's Witnesses and then they wake up and realize that they're living a nightmare.  It would be so nice to have a questionnaire.  And at the top of the form, it says, what is your religious affiliation?  What did you grow up?  How did you grow up?  What religious affiliation did you grow up with?  Because once people find out that they're dating somebody that was a Jehovah's Witness, grew up as a Jehovah's Witness, believes in the Jehovah's Witness philosophies.  Let me tell you right now.  You better run.  Run as fast as you can, just like Forrest Gump, baby.  Get up out of there.  So I want you to stay tuned to some future videos because we're going to do a whole series on this because people just need to know what is going on with the Jehovah's Witnesses.  And we're just so tired of people, you know, just suffering because of it.  And we want to help people to understand what's going on and what to expect when they are involved in a relationship with one of Jehovah's Witnesses.  This has been Lady C. Thank you for being in my audience. ",
