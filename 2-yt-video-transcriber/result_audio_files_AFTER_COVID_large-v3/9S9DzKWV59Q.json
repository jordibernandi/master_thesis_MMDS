The security officer there called the supervisor, and then the supervisor let him know that we were doing his fine.  At that point, you guys were already dispatched.  So while we were waiting for you inside, the security guard, Roberto, comes up to me and on films he tells me he's gonna if I film him without his consent not only gonna knock the phone out of my hand but he's gonna knock me out.  so we get this on video and the officer comes.  we explain to him what's going on and he tells us oh you know just there's nothing you can really do.  if you want to go down to the court you can fill out a complaint with them.  but it was not an officer presence.  so I just showed you video.  now here's the thing.  it's assault to me and secondly like carrying a firearm.  that's your second amendment right I can't be in fear just because you're carrying one.  But the moment you threaten me with bodily harm, I've now, like, that's assault.  And he didn't want to do anything about it.  So I said, if you're not going to do anything about it, I'm just going to go place him under arrest.  That's fine.  I'm not scared of his gun.  I'll disarm him.  So I went back inside, and the officer followed me in.  And then he tells this.  Instead of asking him any questions, not offering to file a report.  Actually, I need to go charge my phone.  Guys, I just paused because it was personal information.  So he, at this point, is not interested in taking any sort of report or doing anything about this issue.  The only thing he's interested in is he goes to the security guard and says, he pats him on the back and says, hey, man, just go ahead and go into the break room.  Excuse us.  Like, that's not an acceptable way to deal with things.  He doesn't even want to do any investigation.  So at this point, in front of the officer, I place this guy. ",

We have this guy confirming that he threatened me.  And the officer's response is, just go in the break room, buddy.  It's all right, just walk away.  Not to you.  No, to the guy that assaulted me.  Yeah.  So he goes, at this point, since I see the officer's doing nothing, I read him his Miranda rights and I place him under citizen's arrest.  At this point... The officer?  No, I placed the security guard.  Roberto.  Roberto, the guy that threatened me.  Under citizen's arrest.  And at this point in time, this officer doesn't want to do anything.

Roberto, security, told us we couldn't film and called the police.  His supervisor then informed him we could film.  We waited for police while waiting.  And on film, Roberto told me he was going to knock me out and knock the phone out of my hand.  Officer Green arrived and refused to take a report.  Despite seeing video evidence and the suspect, Roberto, admitting guilt, he instead told the suspect to flee.  I placed the suspect under citizen's arrest.  Once Officer Green realized who I was... And with orders from a sergeant, he finally took a report.  Officer Green was derelict in his duty.  Ribeiro placed me in fear for my life, exhibiting threats while armed.  He was disorderly and assaulted me.  And in the officer complaint form, I informed Officer Green that I had been threatened with bodily harm by someone with a gun.  I showed him video evidence and the suspect admitted this to the officer.  At this time, Officer Green told the suspect to go and relax in the break room and refused to assist until he found out who I was.  Video evidence available.  We don't give names and information.  We can file this anonymously.  I gave them an email.  Let's turn it in.  Follow through.  This is the officer complaint form for Officer Green.  And this is the... the statement form of my interaction with both the suspect I was involved with and Officer Green.  Those both go to Lieutenant?  Those both go to Lieutenant.  All right, you all set?  I believe so.  When can I come back to get the report information and to find out what's going on with that?  He's going to have to tell you that in a little while.  All right, so yeah, I'll speak to him before I leave then.  Thank you.  Like, literally, he did not take a complaint until he understood who I was.  Like, the police have to know you could expose them on a YouTube channel to respond to your complaint?  That's ridiculous.  That's absolutely ridiculous.  When the cat's away, the mice will play.  And when the big bad wolf is gone, the piggies will act up, unless I come back to blow their house down. ",
