            "text": "All right, where were we?  Biden has resisted opening his Senate papers that span from 1973 to 2009.  Or his documents.  Hey, hey, hey, come on, man.  Where am I?  What's going on?  Oh, well, um, you, uh, you sprained your ankle, Joe.  I sprained my ankle?  I know that, Mr.  Man.  You sprained your ankle.  So you're telling me that my ankle is sprained?  Joe, do you have amnesia?  Maybe so, but, uh, hey, what happens now?  Well, you leave that up to me, Joe.  I'm going to take real good care of you.  You're going to take care of me, what, like a nurse?  Yes, Joe, like a nurse.  All right.  Hey, if I need something, how do I get a hold of you?  Well, you can call me on my cell phone.  What's your number?  It's 202-225-4965.  Say that again, but a little slower.  All right, all right, all right.  It's two, zero, two, two, two, five, four, nine, six, five.  All right, good.  Hey, hey, hey, what ever happened to Hunter's laptop?  Oh, you don't have to worry about that sock-a-zooty laptop anymore, Joe.  Okay, so, uh, am I president yet?  I mean, did the voter fraud organization thing work?  Well, not exactly.  I mean, um, my chief of staff is the CEO of the voter thing, but... But what?  I mean, did I win or not?  Well, to be perfectly honest with you, um, no.  No, you didn't win, so... I didn't?  No, so I won.  Wait, wait, wait.  You won?  Yep.  Wait a minute.  What?  I won the election, Joe.  Wait, so you're president?  Well, not yet.  You know, I mean, there's still a few loose ends I need to take care of.  What kind of loose ends?  Well, it's funny.  you should ask, you little dirty birdie.  Because you're one of my loose ends.  I am?  Yes, you are.  I mean, I've kind of looked, but I haven't found no evidence.  Hey, Joe, uh, do you know how to type?  Uh, pretty much.  You know, I've seen it done.  I watch the people that tweet my tweets for me.  Good, good.  So, um, what's gonna happen, Joe, is, uh, you're gonna type a letter saying you're, uh, not gonna be able to fulfill your duty as president?  Hey, come on, man.  It's just a sprained ankle.  You know, I mean, it'll heal.  You know, Joe, um, spray legos have a funny way of turning into full body cash if they don't heal properly.  Uh, so, uh, who do I make this letter out to?  June!  I will be the most powerful woman in the universe!  Hey, so, uh, what happens to all the money I get from China and, and, and, and, and, and, in Russia.  Don't worry about it, Joe.  I'll spend that money for you.  Oh, that's awful nice.  Wait a minute, wait a minute.  You mean I don't get none of it?  No, Joe.  Where you're going, you don't need money.  I don't?  Nope.  Joe, where you're going, you don't have to worry about anything anymore.  Hey, my ankle's starting to feel a little bit better.  Well, I was looking, but who the hell am I kidding?  I wasn't looking.  Case closed.  President Pelosi it is.  Hello?  Anybody there?  Hunter?  Kamala?  Hey, what's the name of my wife again?  Hey, it's the big guy.  Anybody there?  My ankle's starting to feel better.  Hello? ",
