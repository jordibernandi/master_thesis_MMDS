            "text": "Government likens Uyghur to cancerous tumor.  These people are systematically oppressed by their own government.  We've been waking up to horrific stories every day.  Heartbreaking images separating mothers from their children.  They live in a police state.  There's an ethnic group in China being systematically surveilled and imprisoned in an attempt to essentially wipe their culture off the map.  A UN panel says the region resembles a massive internment camp.  Imagine that the police force you to stand in front of the camera for biometric data collection.  For the last two years, the Western-funded media that operates across the globe have been flooding us with countless videos, articles, and aggressive internet memes, perhaps with the goal of shaping our minds to react in a certain way when we hear the word Xinjiang.  They've described this Chinese autonomous region as an open-air prison and as something comparable to the Holocaust.  Because of all the times the Western media have lied, I've completely lost trust with them, especially after the U.S.  invaded Iraq based on one big lie.  the province of Xinjiang.  It's more than four times the size of Germany and borders eight countries.  It's home to some 11 million Uyghurs.  This clip is a perfect example of propaganda by omission.  Notice that the map is showing the countries that border the Chinese province of Xinjiang.  But wait a second.  Do you notice that a few countries aren't being shown?  Right here is actually Afghanistan.  Literally the most important reason why many Chinese Uyghurs had become radicalized and even waged jihad is because Afghanistan and its never-ending American war lies right on the Xinjiang border.  But of course, the Western media doesn't want you to know that.  With that said, I knew that I had to see Xinjiang with my own eyes in order to know the truth.  This is my trip to Xinjiang during the worst pandemic in a hundred years.  Hello.  Thank you.  So I just ordered this.  why my which means take out in Chinese and it came in this really pretty bag.  I can't believe they gave you this just for delivery.  It just seems a little bit wasteful.  Anyway, let's see if it's gonna be good.  Of course, you got your chopsticks and stuff And by the way, this was only 20 kuai including everything the delivery charge the packaging and that's $4 Canadian.  I want to have like enough protein because the hotel food just didn't have enough and So this is called pidan shou rou zhou.  It's supposed to have eggs and a little bit of meat.  As you can see, it's quite a decent amount.  And then this is a small little beef sandwich.  So it looks pretty decent.  We're in Xinjiang right now, and I'm still in quarantine day three.  I just got my test back.  The test results were negative, of course.  Thank God.  I want to say I'm so happy.  I got the phone call from my civil servant who's been helping me.  So everyone, when you get quarantined, you get someone assigned to you from the government, a civil servant, and you can communicate with him or her through WeChat and they just keep you updated and let you know what's happening.  So I'll just give you a quick tour of the room and then we're out of here.  So here's a sign that's saying, please stay in your room.  But outside, there's nothing really out there blocking you or anything.  I had two beds.  Here's my desk, and here's the window, and it's been a pretty cool view of the city.  Although we're not downtown at all, so it's not a downtown view.  I'll just show you the washroom.  So I just made it out of quarantine.  I just wanted to show you this sign has Chinese script and also Uyghur script as well.  So one thing I find interesting is that there's these metal detectors and they're not even plugged in anymore.  So I guess they used to be used, but as you can see, it's unplugged and they used to have to deal with a risk of violence, but that's all gone now.  So that's good.  So here, even the bank, it has Uyghur script and you can see at the top Uyghur and Chinese, so it's pretty cool.  Attempt to essentially wipe their culture off the map.  I'm at a pretty central area right now.  This is a really cool building.  I have no idea what it is, but it kind of has this colonial feeling to it.  It might have been the office of some colonial power.  I don't really know the history of Yuma-chi or Xinjiang.  But yeah, this is a nice area as you can see.  Everyone's wearing their masks, even though there's not many cases in Xinjiang.  There's a lot of police stations in Xinjiang because as you might already know, there were a lot of terrorist attacks here.  Two months after the Kunming incident, five terrorists rammed their vehicles into shoppers at the morning market in Xinjiang's regional capital, Wenmuchi, setting off explosives.  They killed 39 people and wounded 94.  A truck driver hid his wife in the backseat.  She was lucky and escaped.  He did not.  From either Islamic extremists or even just the separatists.  I'm from Canada, so I'm used to knowing about Quebec separatism, which still exists today.  Yeah, we're walking.  into the reports of forced abortions and sterilizations of Uighur women Uighur folks?  Yeah, it's getting really busy.  A UN panel says the region resembles a massive internment camp.  I'm walking with all my luggage because I just came out of quarantine today.  And I'm blogging right off the block, man.  Right out of the gates.  I'm blogging for you guys because I'm walking through the city.  And... And if you see some people that look kind of like Westerners, those are the Uyghur people.  So yeah, we're at a... Yeah, we're at Nanhu Guangchang.  That means South Lake Square.  This looks like the popular area right here.  Gotta go through security again there.  Yeah, it looks like a fun street.  Look at this street over here.  Looks like a fun street.  And there's a security check before you get in here.  So it's all reminiscent of when there used to be separatist or terrorist attacks.  They're still vigilant on insecurity.  They're still vigilant on insecurity.  Mainland Chinese people view Uyghur people as very, very beautiful because they have Western features.  Some of them even look Caucasian.  Some Asian people really prefer that aesthetic, like a sharper nose and a higher nose bone, stronger eye bridge.  And look, I'm not even getting into the reports of forced abortions and sterilizations of Uyghur women, which are absolutely horrific.  So I have my camera out, everyone can see me filming and there's no problem.  So you can definitely film openly in Xinjiang.  I'm starting to feel like all Western reports.  It's just a big lie that there's concentration camps here.  I mean, it just seems ridiculous when you think about it.  So I'm starting to think that's just a big mythology created by the West to justify war, justify criminal actions.  As I said, I'm openly filming.  I have a small camera, but I'm going to walk by this security guy.  I'm sure he will not care.  I'm going to walk by this guy right now.  He's not going to care that I'm filming.  Just walk right by him.  He did not care.  He saw my camera.  And I'm speaking English as well.  Yeah, here's a busy... So here I am in Xinjiang guys Xinjiang.  A lot of you guys were saying, go to Xinjiang, go to Xinjiang.  I'm here, man.  I listen to you guys.  What's really cool about Xinjiang?  It looks like it's 6  p.m.,  right?  But it's actually 10 p.m.  Xinjiang time.  Because in China, there's only one time.  So even though we're far, far west.  Uyghurs started being treated like they were all potential terrorists.  In fact, Xinjiang is now one of the most heavily policed areas in the world.  So you're seeing this beautiful 10 p.m.  sunset in Yumerqi, Xinjiang.  Yeah.  South Lake Citizen Square.  This is my luggage that I was carrying around.  So I'm so tired.  So I'm just having a seat here.  I just want to see how cute this square is with these kids.  That's what it's all about, man.  That's why China has education centers.  And from what I can see, it's work.  They've created a harmonious society.  They're doing what they think is best in the Chinese way, which is education.  You can be Muslim in Xinjiang.  It's fine.  But they don't want any extremism.  Yes, they do have some limitations on Muslims here.  I can see that.  They don't let young men grow beards.  I don't see any women wearing hijabs.  And that's for you to decide if that's right or wrong.  In order to create social harmony, you can see how super peaceful it is here.  People are just enjoying their lives.  No worries about random acts of terrorism or violence.  I know in my country, in Canada, Quebec was banning hijabs.  And I think they did ban it.  So even in our Western countries where we claim that we're totally free, our countries also promote these kinds of decisions to limit some freedoms in order to preserve cultural harmony.  There's everyone crossing the street over there.  Hello.  I'm a blogger.  Can I take a picture of you?  I don't know.  Did you just start?  Yes, I'm a beginner.  When did you start?

Alright, so I made it to my hotel.  Here it is.  And it's really cool because it's actually in a Uyghur neighborhood.  Maybe I'll meet some more locals here.  This is super cool because I'm at this hotel and I didn't expect it.  But like pretty much everyone is Uyghur here.  And yeah, really really cool.  Everyone.  The workers, the guests.  Yeah, because that's the neighborhood I'm in right now.  Hello.  First night in Urumqi and it seems like there's a party vibe going on, man.  People are buying beers, people are buying drinks.

If you have any friends that have WeChat, perhaps they can help you to send some support.  I would really appreciate it.  I spent about 20 to 30 hours on this video, so it really does mean a lot, as this is like my second full-time job.  Anyways, I hope you're having a great day. ",
