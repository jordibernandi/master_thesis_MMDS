            "text": "Hi folks, I'm Steve Hindy for Showing Animals Respect and Kindness.  This is a tragic scene which occurred at the 2019 Ellensburg Rodeo in Ellensburg, Washington.  Rodeo people pretend that making horses buck is acceptable behavior.  And they have plenty of unethical corporate sponsors and sycophants in the media that perpetuate this attitude.  But making a horse buck is overworking.  Horses may buck sometimes in times of play, or if they're attacked by a predator.  But in rodeos, the horses are bucking to escape the discomfort of the strap that is tightened around their groin as they leave the chute.  This is artificial behavior induced so artificial cowboys can win prizes and avoid getting real jobs.  In addition to the strap, the horses are spurred furiously.  Any good equestrian knows that spurs are a tool to be used very sparingly.  The best equestrians don't use spurs at all.  In rodeo, not only are the spurs required, but the contestant is given extra points for the aggressive application of spurs.  You've got to go for it.  That's just what he did.  How about an 88-point fairback ride?  The spurs are not sharp, but neither is a pen.  But just try stabbing a pen into your ribs or shoulders a few times and see how that feels.  Dr.  Peggy Larson, a former rodeo rider and veterinarian who has cared for rodeo animals, has explained that spurring causes blunt force trauma that can cause hemorrhaging under the skin, which is very painful.  On top of all that, horses are often shocked by a device called a hot shot.  which produces thousands of volts of painful static electricity.  This abuse and its consequences occur at rodeos across the U.S Once injured, most of these victims are simply disposed of, and the abuse and its repercussions continue.  Rodeo tries to sell itself as an American sport, but in truth, it's about as unsporting and un-American as it can be.  That so many companies, local governments, police, and politicians support this kind of blatant, indefensible animal abuse is an enormous stain on the integrity of the United States.  Pandering politicians sanctimoniously proclaim Americans to be exceptional.  But if rodeos are any indication, we're just exceptionally cruel to animals and deluded about who and what we really are.  But we can change that.  We can stop companies and governments from supporting animal abuse and stop the abuse itself.  All that is required is that we actually be those exceptional people that the politicians talk about.  But they don't even mind if you're with them so long as you're being nice to them.  And this guy, look at this guy.  If you care about animals, please do not go to rodeos.  And please do not do business with unethical corporate rodeo sponsors such as Coca-Cola, Best Buy, Discount Tires, and Coors Beer.  These companies know what's going on because we've been exposing rodeos for more than 25 years, but they just don't care.  We've included contact information in the description section of this video so you can let these companies know your thoughts.  I'm Steve Hindy for Showing Animals Respect and Kindness.  Before we go, we're adding this message to each video that exposes a PRCA-sanctioned rodeo.  And because the PRCA is the largest rodeo association, that's most of them.  We have on numerous occasions tried to bring specific concerns and allegations of abuse to George Taylor, the commissioner of the PRCA.  These include the brutal abuse of steer busting, the disappearing of injured rodeo animals, the shocking of rodeo animals, and other cruelty.  The concerns and allegations are founded on decades of video documentation and in some cases on official government records, all of which we have placed in the public domain for all to see.  That Commissioner Taylor will not respond to the evidence leads to just one conclusion, that Mr.  Taylor understands that the weight of the evidence is overwhelming and that there is no defense for the abuse, and most disturbingly, that Mr.  Taylor, his administration, and the PRCA generally has absolutely no intention to change a thing.  We find Mr.  Taylor's determined indifference to be repulsive, no honor, ",
