            "text": "Dear WordPress, in shameless self-referential rhetoric, my condolences to my three hours spent on your abusively dysfunctional website.  The highest trauma experienced on a computer is loss of work, and you've designed the most prolific work incinerator.  Never display a work safe button that does not save work.  Your website builder is a labyrinth with no end, just false exit signs.  I'm taking all my content and financing to your competitor GoDaddy.  It is beyond me how pornography is infinite, free, and intuitive, yet you are more of an affront to humanity.  I've seen online beheadings more dignified than WordPress.  Create an insert penis tab because if you sucked anymore, I'd turn you into Interpol.  I'm not Sir Mix-a-Lot, but my time with you came to an end, you software Blair Witch Project.  Trying to navigate your software was an experience like watching Memento on mute with Spanish subtitles to impress a Oaxaca prostitute while managing Mexican tap water trots in between finger corking three fat meth balloons only to find out that the prostitute was a DEA rectal meth balloon specialist who hates Memento and loves locked up abroad.  I guess what I'm saying is I had some trouble with your software.  Here's a list of more productive things than your service.  46 car pileups with a baby on board, vasectomies, Enron, pyramid hostage crises, eating disorder, hunger strikes, minor league t-ball, partial birth, murder, Boy Scout cookies, flat spare tires, aortic hatchet wounds, reestablishing male-female-male gender re-reassignment surgery, World War II, Chernobyl, taffy on a camping trip, domestic math quest disagreements, mandatory marijuana life sentences, prison ocular tattooing, the Salem witch executions, drip candles, drunk engineering, scholastic assault rifles, country music, The Voice, the Home Shopping Network, keeping up with the COVID-19s, post-corona handshakes, alcohol interdependence, paper jams, homeschooling three-year-olds, closed captioning for Charlie Chaplin and the Baghdad Jazz Fest.
