Normally, I deal with the mass stupidity that is the Flat Earth, but lately the stupid around other things has been strong, especially the anti-mask Karen Brigade, so I've decided to bring back stupid humans for Episode 6 as we take a look at some of the worst male Karens around.  sit back and engage your facepalm protection as we look at some really, really stupid humans.  Thanks for joining me once again as we delve into some serious stupid.  Today, we are looking at four wonderful examples of humanity.  People that really, really care about others and are the most selfless... Oh wait, sorry, the script was wrong there.  These guys are fucking dicks.  We are in the midst of a global pandemic that has taken nearly a million lives and all we're asking is that you wear a mask in shops or other places that you could be in close proximity to others to help curb the spread of a deadly pathogen.  Sounds reasonable, right?  Not to Karen it isn't.  meet our first pair of Karens.  So what you're saying is that you've already been denied entry for not covering your disgusting face holes and Just to be a dick, you're going to go and try to get back in, possibly making someone's job a little shittier.  I mean, that's grade-A fucknugget behavior.  We're in the middle of a worldwide paradigm shift where we all have to adapt, and it's made a lot of jobs harder, and you just want to make someone's day a little worse.  Great job, Karen. ",
