            "text": "Before I became a Christian through faith in Jesus Christ, I used to wonder is this all we had to look forward to?  What would happen to me after this is over?  It really used to bother me, the uncertainty of not knowing what would come after I pass on.  This internal dialogue became overwhelming at times and the only adequate way I can describe it is it felt as if I was drowning.  That's the truth.  it felt as if I was drowning in it.  And in the ocean of my own thoughts I found a lifeline and that lifeline was the Bible.  And in the Bible I met a man.  Called Jesus.  My Lord Jesus.  And what astonished me about Jesus is that Jesus lived his whole life with the expectation and hope and motivation of one day going back home to heaven.  The assurance of heaven ought to make a difference in our lives, just like it made a difference in the life of Jesus.  Well, you may say to me, you cannot be sure you're going to heaven.  You cannot be sure you're going to heaven until you die.  But that's not true.  Men and women in the Bible knew that they were going to heaven.  Our Lord Jesus did.  John 14 In my Father's house are many mansions.  If it were not so, I would have told you.  I go to prepare a place for you.  This wasn't a privilege reserved only for Jesus.  John knew he was going to heaven.  Yes he did.  1 John 3 verse 2 Beloved, now we are the children of God.  It has not yet been revealed what we shall be, but we know that when He is revealed, we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is.  1 John 5.13 These things I have written unto you, who believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life.  King David, Israel's greatest king, knew he was going to heaven.  According to Psalms 23 verse 6, Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.  Paul knew he was going to heaven.  2 Timothy chapter 1 verse 12b, he says, For I know... For I know whom I have believed in, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.  There are some distinct signs, some residual evidences, some clear benefits that demonstrate that a believer is saved and that he or she is going to heaven.  I don't believe that God would put us into suspense as to whether or not we will make it to heaven.  We do not necessarily have to go before the judgment throne, ",
