This is nothing more than a Christian talisman, a rabbit's foot, or a West African juju.  Friends, don't be fooled by this.  So where did this oil come from?  Well, it came from one-gallon containers of mineral oil bought by Jerry Pierce at Tractor Supply Company.  We know this because he admitted it.  On their own website, his name is Flowing Oil, we find this.  Jerry states that he has, in fact, bought mineral oil from Tractor Supply, but at no time added it to the vials being distributed at meetings or to the container holding the Bible.  Thank you.  In a subsequent interview, though, with the Chattanooga Times Free Press, Jerry is quoted as saying he bought eight gallons of mineral oil from Tractor Supply one time to pour it on the Bible, but God told him to throw it away.  Now, that may well be, but the Times also reported that two employees of Tractor Supply in Dalton, Georgia, witnessed Jerry Pierce regularly coming into their store to buy gallons of mineral oil. ",

The claim made by Jerry and Johnny is that it's similar to mineral oil, but it has stuff in it that's not manufactured by man.  Well, now we know that that's a lie as well.  The Times Free Press had the oil tested at the Chemical Engineering Laboratory of the University of Tennessee with a Berger Alpha Infrared Spectroscope.  and here are their findings.  The supernatural oil is petroleum derived and the results strongly suggest that the oil sample is plain old mineral oil.  The second test, comparing the chemical composition of the oil supposedly dripping from the Bible to the product sold at Tractor Supply, found a nearly exact match.  Well, no big surprise there.  The Flowing Oil Facebook page is either gone or now has gone private.  I don't know.  But amazingly, the oily website, his name is Flowing Oil, is still up as of February 28th.  But there have been some changes.  When I did my last Oily Bible update, we found this on the bottom of their page.  If there is a miracle here, it's this.  That this hoax has been going on for as long as it has without anyone blowing the whistle on the whole thing.  Now my hunch, and it's only a hunch, that in time, someone will.  And one more thing.  I noticed a small little logo at the bottom of the Flowing Oil website.  It's a PayPal logo where you can send a love offering to Jerry and Johnny.  But now, amazingly, the PayPal link is nowhere to be found.  It's also very telling that the Rockbridge Church, who was allowing Jerry and Johnny to use its Wink Theater, which they bought for their weekly prayer slash revival meetings, is no longer extending them that courtesy and is in fact distancing themselves from the oily Bible brigade.  This is a post on the church website.  Flowing oil was not a ministry of Rockbridge.  Before flowing oil was officially formed, there was a very organic and informal group of people gathering downtown for prayer and fellowship in a local Bible trinket store, basically.  When this store ran out of space, the prayer group requested to use our facility.  This practice continued until the group recently decided to cease meeting.  Then the news story broke.  There's also been a strange confluence of things that have been happening.  Let's back up a little bit.  In late November 2019, Wyatt Massey, the reporter for the Free Press, did his first article on the leaky Bible.  On February 14th, the Oily Bible website stated that the Bible had stopped leaching oil and that they would no longer have meetings at Rockbridge Church or take the Bible on the road, as you can see by their newly amended schedule.  All road shows cancelled!  But at the same time all this is happening, in early February at the Soaring Eagle Ministry Teaching Center in Cleveland, Tennessee, where Jerry Pierce has been occasionally attending, a certain Brody Allred was claiming that gold is appearing in chunks all over the place and his guitar is now producing oil at their facility.  Now, this video was taken down by Brody right after Johnny and Jerry's scam crashed and burned, but not before someone else grabbed it and shared it.  I don't know what to say. ",

Now, I witnessed this whopper myself when my brother and I went down to Harbor Light Church in Costa Mesa, California, to see the Leaky Bible last year and to hear from its spokesman, Johnny Taylor.  And we got an email from this lady, and she said, my daughter's sick.  The car's having trouble.  Woke up, she can't go to school.  I got to take her to school.  The car's messed up.  I got to take her to the doctor.  The car's messed up.  She said, I broke my hamster cage, and the hamster's dead.  She said, he's turned up on his back, but all four's up in the air.  And I left, and I took her to the doctor.  He said, I came home, the hamster's nose is blue, his body's hard, and the little girl says, Mama, we've been laying hands on people and they spoil the church.  How come we can't lay it on my hamster?  First of all, she's on the hamster of the church.  So the little girl gets her drop of oil and sticks it on the nose of the hamster and it jumps up and starts running around the place.  So from a single dab of oil we get a bodily resurrection of a hamster.  He talks about dogs too, but we won't spend time there.  Anyone thinking of entering into veterinary medicine should strongly reconsider.  Folks, it's just plain mineral oil, just like the oil I bought to submerge the worthless Gospel of Judas in as we tested what would happen to this book and the highlighting that I did within it.  Listen, discernment is a good word.  Discernment is the ability to distinguish one thing from another.  It's a good from bad, genuine from counterfeit, helpful or hurtful, and in this case, truth from error.  Many, many people have fallen into serious doctrinal errors from the lack of discernment.  Proverbs gives us so many gems of how to be discerning.  For instance, Proverbs 12, 11, \"...whoever belittles his neighbor lacks sense, but a man of understanding remains  silent.\".  Paul writes in 1.  Thessalonians 5, 20-22, he says, \"...do not despise prophecies, the foretelling of God's word.  Hold fast to what is good.  Test everything.  Abstain from every form of  evil.\".  Discernment comes from God's Word.  We are to be like the Bereans in Acts 17.  We read there, Now these Jews, the Bereans, were more noble than those in Thessalonica.  They received the Word of God with all eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see if these things were so.  See, we need to take the words of the Lord Jesus very seriously.  He said in Matthew 24, 11, Many false prophets will arise and lead many astray. ",
