            "text": "All right, let's do a deep dive into correcting lies.  This is difficult in our current political climate.  Donald Trump yesterday absolutely collapsed like a house of cards under basic questioning by ABC's David Muir.  Yesterday, Trump was in Arizona, went to a mask factory, didn't wear a mask, total propaganda visit.  But in the middle of it, Trump was interviewed by David Muir of ABC.  Uh, he didn't really do anything special other than be a basic journalist asking Trump specific questions and waiting for an answer and Trump's disintegration.  Trump became aerosolized.  Let me put it that way.  That was the degree of disintegration.  It is really something to behold.  Uh, I'm going to do something that's a real pain to do, which is I'm going to fact check three minutes of a Trump interview.  And it's so lie riddled that you will notice it takes a lot longer than three minutes to do the fact checking.  And as usual, more people hear the lie.  Very few hear the correction.  The correction is more work.  This is what we're up against.  But let's do it.  Let's do it together.  OK.  So let's start with.  David Muir presents Trump with a quote.  The quote is one you've probably heard before.  Trump said 15 cases are soon going to go to zero.  Let's dig in.  I'm going to try to fact check set you so that you can understand how these lies are spread and perpetuated and they become actually like an alternative.  truth to Trump is that they repeat.  Let's get into the first question here. ",

            "text": "There was one thing.  you said that.  Perhaps you could clarify.  You said this was at the end of February.  A full month had gone by.  You'd stopped travel from China.  And you said of the cases here in the  U.S.,  when you have 15 people and when the 15 within a couple of days is going to go down to zero, that's a pretty good job we've done.  Help me understand that moment.  Did you really think we were going to have 15 cases in the  U.S.? ",

We knew about it.  We worked on it, but we had one person.  It mushroomed.  the 15 people mushroom.  Other people were coming in also from Europe. ",

            "text": "So already we have to think this through.  The question was, when you said we have 15 and they're going to go to zero, how did you come up with that?  Walk us through how you decided 15 cases were going to go to zero.  And Trump says, well, it was true.  You know, at one point we did have only 15 cases.  At one point we did have only one case.  That wasn't the question.  And one tool that's really important to have when you're trying to parse lies from from government officials or anybody is are they answering the question that was asked?  Have they given an answer?  And Trump has not.  The question was not did we really only have 15 cases at one point?  Of course.  Right.  I mean, we now have one point two million official cases.  At some point we had zero.  You have to go through the number 15 to get there.  There's no question about that.  That wasn't the question.  The question was, why did you think 15 would go to zero?  Trump doesn't answer it.  Let's continue.  Now Trump pulls out this sad piece of paper he'd been carrying around all day and it gets very, very, uh, gaslit at this point.  Take a look. ",
