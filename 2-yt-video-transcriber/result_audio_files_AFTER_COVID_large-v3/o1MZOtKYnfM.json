Centra is a tool that Facebook uses to track its users, not just on Facebook, but across the entire Internet.  Centra attacks different profiles that a user visits.  their message recipients, their linked accounts, the pages they visit around the web that have Facebook buttons.  Centra also uses behavioral data to monitor users' accounts, even if those accounts are registered under a different name, and you can see a shot here, a screenshot provided to us of the Centra platform.  We've blocked out the user's name in the interest of privacy, although you can see this individual's birth date and age, when they first started using Facebook, their last login, as well as all manner of trackings.  How many different devices have they used to access Facebook?  How many different accounts are associated with their name?  What accounts have they visited?  What photos have they tagged? ",
