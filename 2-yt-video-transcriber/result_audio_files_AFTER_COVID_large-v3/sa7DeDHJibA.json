Now, I am very, I'm ecstatic to report that we're beginning to see armed citizens throughout the nation rise up and push back effectively, very effectively push back.  Against BLM, Black Lives Matter radicals and activists are beginning to test the waters in various suburbs.  We have to realize that the more our nation cities rot and fall apart, the more BLM radicals are gonna actually begin harassing and tearing down our suburbs.  And we've seen this before.  It was actually in the Civil War in Colombia during the years 1948 and 1958.  And that's where you had what were originally urban riots spilling out into the suburbs with the exurbs and rural areas fighting back against them.  So the suburbs most likely are gonna end up being ground zero in the escalation of BLM violence.  The wonderful news is that armed citizens in the suburbs and exurbs are ready.  And they're coming out in droves to defend their neighborhoods and their neighbors.  Now, the latest example comes from Seattle.  The Seattle police chief there, Carmen Best, has unfortunately become a target for BLM radicals who've been appearing outside her home in the last few days in order to intimidate her, to get her to support the defunding of Seattle's police department.  The mayor there as well, that ultra left lunatic Jenny Durkan, who was a supporter and sympathizer with the whole Chaz autonomous zone.  She's also gotten, shall we call them visitors to show up at her home.  Again, it's mob rule, this is a banana republic politics.  And to her credit, the Seattle police chief, she's calling it just that.  And she's imploring Seattle's city council to not cut the police department and instead to show full support for their law enforcement in the face of these radical Marxist extremists.  Now, if this police chief is unsure as to whether she can count on Seattle's city council to support her.  Any uncertainties have been clearly dispelled when it comes to counting on her neighbors.  Just the other day, a bunch of whiny, cowardly, radical activists showed up in the neighborhood of this police chief.  And they were met with a group of residents who were armed and formed a blockade to their neighborhood.  And they told these leftist BLM activists in no uncertain terms to take a hike and get the hell out of their neighborhood.  And the best part, we've talked about this before, the best part is that the police chief, Carmen Best, has given her neighbors her full and unwavering support.  In a letter that she sent to Seattle's Democrat City Council, she said that her neighbors were concerned by the group, but they were successful in ensuring the crowd was not able to trespass or engage in other illegal behavior in the area despite repeated attempts to do so.  Now, amen to that.  And that is how you push back the darkness.  When law abiding citizens team up with law enforcement, we are unbeatable.  And that's precisely what happened.  These whiny, woke activists retreated from the neighborhood with their tails between their legs.  They looked ridiculous.  They showed up to show their wokeness and they walked away whimpering and whining.  Now, of course, this is not just happening in Seattle.  You may have heard about this, now this is awesome.  In Louisville, Kentucky, have you heard about this one?  It's over the past weekend.  In Louisville, Kentucky, a bunch of BLM thugs have actually been extorting business owners.  The business owners have been receiving lists of demands from BLM radicals about workplace diversity standards.  Of course, defined and enforced by the arbitrary whims of BLM Marxists.  They demanded that a minimum of 23% of any business staff have to be black, and they had to buy 23% of their goods from black-owned retailers.  In addition, get this, all black business owners had to make a recurring monthly donation 1.5% of their net sales to a local black nonprofit organization.  And the cherry on the top is that they have to publicly display the demands on their storefront window, as one business owner said, or else they would get effed up.  They'll come after you if you don't meet their demands.  Now, this is classic racketeering and extortion.  And one fellow, God bless him, there's a city store owner with a soul there.  He told these BLM nuts to shove it.  Fernanda Martinez, a restaurant owner who came to the United States from Cuba in order to flee from this kind of Marxist thugocracy.  He stood up and called his fellow Cuban neighbors and friends and relatives, and they put on a mass demonstration in Louisville to push back against what they're calling blatant mafia tactics.  Members of Louisville's Cuban community gathered together last Sunday in a show of support of this restaurant owner who's being threatened by BLM thugs.  Martinez wrote on his Facebook, God bless this guy, there comes a time in life that you have to make a stand and you have to really prove your convictions and what you believe in.  All good people need to denounce this.  How can you justify injustice with more injustice?  Again, amen and amen.  By the way, you may be interested in knowing how the president and CEO of the Louisville Urban League, Sadiqa Reynolds, you might be interested in how she responded to Martinez.  She also took to Facebook and said she will no longer be eating at Martinez's restaurant and wonders why any human other than a racist would choose this time to tell us how little our lives matter.  Now, this is a wonderful window into the soul, what's left of it at the far left, like that of Sadiqa Reynolds.  What we have to understand is that as far as these far left radicals are concerned, The violation of politically correct norms actually justifies violence.  And you've got to get that.  What we're getting from these BLM activists and their Democrat enablers and supporters, what we're getting from our mainstream Marxist media is the notion that if politically correct norms have been violated, so we're talking acts of racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, whatever it happens to be, if politically correct norms have been violated, then violence in response to such a violation is absolutely justified.  We've talked about this on other videos.  I like to use the example, I think it's so good, of Serena Williams, the tennis player in her meltdown at the US Open a couple of years back.  You may remember this.  It was at the women's final of the US Open.  Serena Williams had a total and complete meltdown on the court.  She had a total temper tantrum and the umpire penalized her and she completely unraveled.  She started calling them all kinds of names.  It was brutal.  She was hyperventilating and all this.  And of course, she went on to lose.  And so when she was at the post-game press conference, when she was speaking at the press conference after the match, In order to justify that meltdown, do you remember this?  She defended her temper tantrum and her threats by claiming that she was valiantly fighting for women's equality.  She said that she was fighting for women's rights and women's equality and that the umpire would never have treated a male tennis player that way.  He would never have treated a male tennis player the way he treated her.  And when the press conference was over, the press room stood up and gave her standing ovation.  I want that to hit you.  She had a freaking public temper tantrum on court.  She acted ridiculous.  She humiliated herself.  She hurled nothing short of verbal violence at this officiating referee.  But instead of apologizing, She justified it by appealing to women's equality.  As long as she was defending herself against the supposed violation of politically correct norms, then her verbal violence not only could be applauded, it ought to be applauded.  Do you see?  You get it?  As long as you're standing up for politically correct values, as long as you're standing against inequalities, racism, bigotry, homophobia, whatever, sexism, you're allowed to be as hysterical and insane and as violent as you want.  And with the Louisville situation, we're finding that this standard for violence is frankly all-encompassing.  It's actually a totalizing perspective.  So if your society is deemed racist and oppressive, then any woke warrior has a right to basically demand whatever he or she wants of you.  If Louisville's been condemned by these Marxist radicals as systemically racist, then these radicals are completely justified in threatening violence and engaging in mass extortion.  That's the real world of these BLM radicals.  The beauty of it all is that citizens are rising up.  They're increasingly having none of it.  Like the armed neighbors in Seattle suburb and the Cuban community defending one of their own in Louisville.  Good law abiding citizens together with their local police are rising up and telling these BLM Marxists to shove it and take a hike.  And as such, they are speaking for a silent majority of Americans who more and more are becoming silent no longer.
