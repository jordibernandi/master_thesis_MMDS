No one believes that.  literally nobody pays the doctors or hospital staff.  It's silly to point out that it's not literally free.  Of course we pay for it through our taxes, but because our government cuts a deal with healthcare companies using bargaining power that individuals simply don't have, we end up paying far less per capita than Americans do.  According to that pinko socialist propaganda rag, Business Insider, in 2017, America paid $10,209 per person for healthcare, while Canada only paid $4,826.  More people get treated, and at less than half the price per person.  And paying for it through your taxes means that even if you only pay a few thousand dollars in taxes per year or less, you can still get millions of dollars worth of care at no extra charge.  That sounds like a pretty sweet deal to me. ",

I was born and raised in Montreal, Canada.  That makes me French-Canadian.  I'm so French-Canadian, my name, Alan, is spelled A-L-A-I-N.  I have also lived and work in the United States.  have experienced both Canadian health care and American health care.  Here are some of my experiences with the Canadian system, the one so many Americans aspire to.  I believe they are typical.  So do the Canadians I know.  Experience number one.  In September 2000, my wife was seven months pregnant with our youngest daughter.  One day my wife started having severe lower back pain.  She suspected kidney stones.  She had them in the past, but she was very pregnant, so we needed to check it out.  Kidney stones are bad, but something going wrong with the pregnancy would be a lot worse.  We went to the emergency room of our local hospital in Montreal.  This was Thursday.  She was admitted to the hospital and given morphine for her pain.  She couldn't get an ultrasound the next day because the machine for this procedure was fully booked.  She didn't get the ultrasound during the weekend either because ultrasound operators don't work on weekends.  Finally, on Monday afternoon, she got the test after I begged her doctor to do something so we could find out if indeed my wife had a kidney stone or something had gone wrong with the pregnancy.  Thank God it was the former and not the latter.  In the United States, a pregnant woman doesn't have to wait a day to get an ultrasound if the baby's health is in question.  And ultrasound technicians are available on the weekend. ",

            "text": "Yes, if you're rich enough to easily afford to get an ultrasound in the States, it's much more convenient than in the Canadian system.  However, if you live in the States and are both uninsured and unable to afford to pay for the ultrasound out of pocket, because you're not a millionaire venture capitalist like Alan, you might have to choose between taking the chance that the back pain is a kidney stone and going bankrupt.  Faced with that choice, a lot of people will end up waiting a lot longer than a weekend to get checked out.  Simply having to wait two or three days is a pretty small price to pay to take the risk of bankruptcy off the table.  While a lot of folks have to wait longer for treatment than they do in the States, their place in line is determined by the urgency of their need.  Americans also frequently wait to be treated by a doctor, but they wait because they are saving the money to pay for the treatment, Or they wait until after they get a job with insurance coverage.  I'd rather have to wait because my situation isn't urgent than because I'm trying to avoid a financially catastrophic bill. ",

The specialist asked, Are you suicidal?  My friend responded, No, I'm not suicidal.  I need a back operation.  The specialist concluded, If you are not suicidal, it means you can handle the pain.  Had my friend waited, his surgery would have been covered.  Instead, he went to Florida and paid $20,000 out of his own pocket to have the surgery immediately. ",

Since I have a family history of colon cancer, I was advised to get a colonoscopy every year.  I went to see my specialist in May to set up my next procedure.  After a brief consult, he told me to book the colonoscopy with his secretary on my way out.  She told me that the doctor could perform the procedure in November.  Being used to long waiting times, I felt that was rather short.  So I said, great, that works for me.  She replied, not this November, next November.

It grows and it spreads, sometimes beyond the point when treatment can be effective.  I pray that my friend gets treated in time.

Folks who defend American healthcare love to talk about cancer survival rates in the US.  Your chances of surviving cancer are better in the States than many other places, but cancer seems to be one of the few conditions for which this is true.  Instead of looking at anecdotes, we should instead look at statistics.  On the whole, the mortality rate in the States, due to healthcare amenable conditions, is higher than in most countries with universal healthcare.  I'll put links in the description about this.  I think it's entirely reasonable to infer that this is probably because so many people put off going to the doctor due to financial concerns.  There are lots of headlines about diabetics dying because they're rationing their insulin because they can't afford it.  Nowadays, in our current situation, if you put off medical treatment, you're not only putting yourself at risk, but everybody else as well. ",
