            "text": "Well, it's true.  God loves the world.  And I think we have that message.  But I think that that's not the whole message.  I think if you say what the old Campus Crusade, God loves you and has a wonderful plan for your life, that's not accurate.  Actually, there is currently a terrible plan for your life and destiny.  Yes, I think we're to express that.  God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son.  God does love.  He actually is the Savior.  Paul says He's the Savior of all men, especially those who believe.  There's a sense in which He puts His saving grace on display in common grace.  Sinners don't die when they deserve to die.  So the sins should die.  We should all have been dead before we ever came to the cross.  So we see the love of God in the survival of sinners.  People say, well, look at the Old Testament and all those people that God killed.  That's not the issue.  Look at the Old Testament.  Look at all the people who lived.  When God is putting on the display of His grace and mercy, yes, we preach that.  But the other thing that has to be preached, and it has to be preached equally, is that sin will bring you to eternal damnation and eternal destruction.  And only the love of God can rescue you, and that's only through Christ. ",
