            "text": "Patrons and citizens, many of you have heard me talk about my filing from September 17th, 2020 and securing the borders and the concepts of securing the borders.  I'd like to direct my conversation directly to the Joint Chiefs of the Staff, Secretary of the Navy, Secretary of the Air Force, Secretary of the Army, Commandant of the Marine Corps, commander of the NATO forces, the Russian Ministry of the Defense, as well as the Chinese military.  As you know, I am the postmaster general of our world.  I take it very serious.  I have contracts around the world because of my authorizations as a postmaster-general and commander-in-chief because I am the guy that took down the Universal Postal Union's fraudulent grammar Ponzi scheme against planet Earth.  What this means is before you went into your prospective military branches, you walked into your country's post office and you registered yourself and then went to the military.  You work for the post office.  And I am the Postmaster General of our world.  Now, as you witness the lack of vote and the lack of communication by the American citizens in this fake 2020 presidential election, the scam of a Ken and Mary Poppins make-believe show, acting like there's a president and actually acting like there's an election going on and fooling the American people, causing to the American people, because of our lack of skill sets and communication, to destroy our country as American cities burn.  And the people do this to our country.  Make no wrong about it.  You will not be vulnerable.  You will not allow other countries to attack our borders.  I am very serious here.  There are many mailings that went out to the armed forces and there are terms within the construct under the muster hyphen roles.  I am a muster hyphen master and a muster hyphen master general as well as a paymaster general.  through the Secretary of the Navy's office, as well as my position as Chief Judge of the U.S.  Supreme Court and Chief Judge at the World Court at The Hague for Syntex World Court Judge.  You guys know who I am because of the court-martialing of Bush and Cheney.  At this time, I'm commanding the U.S.  military to be on guard.  Secure our borders.  Don't be cowards.  Don't play into the pantomime of the fake presidential election.  who you guys know, in 1999, all that sham ended.  You secure our borders, you secure our sea lanes.  NATO, it is your job to help.  China and Russia, it is your job to help.  You will not invade the borders of our land.  The citizens of this country, though they cannot communicate at this time, they will be secure in their liberty of their protesting.  They have the right to do that.  but our borders will not be breached and we will not surrender.  American citizens, you do not know what you're doing.  You are falling into a pantomime of fakeness.  There is no presidential election.  It is a scam.  We must learn how to communicate.  Correct communication, parsing through the text grammar and quantum grammar is a way that we can peacefully learn how to get our needs satisfied through the quantum banking system that I've built.  But make no wrong about it.  The U.S.  military, you stand on your pads and you be ready.  You secure our borders as the American people.  and the fakeness of Washington, D.C.  and the fake Congress and the fake pantomime of the U.S.  Postal Service and their fake mailing and their fake ballots and their fake election and their Ken and Barbie scheme goes on.  You do not allow anyone to penetrate our borders and attack our citizens.  I have given you your commands through your muster hyphen rolls.  The FEMA camps will not be used against the American soldiers, nor against the American citizens.  Take a look at what happened in Pakistan in 2007.  When Pakistan declared martial law, the first thing they did is grabbed all the attorneys and threw them into camps. ",
