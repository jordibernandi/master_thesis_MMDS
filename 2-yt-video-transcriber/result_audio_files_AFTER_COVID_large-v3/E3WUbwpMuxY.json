            "text": "This is another epic, awesome, amazing episode of the Unboxing Authority.  If you're homesteading, if you're raising chickens or other types of birds in your livestock and you want to keep eagles and things from coming down and eating your livestock, you need something shiny because that scares away.  predator birds, or at least most predator birds that I'm aware of.  I've never had any problems with predator birds because I've always had something shiny.  Well, the problem is I was using a pie plate and the pie plate actually broke from hanging it up there just because the metal tears in the pie plate.  And so we just had my grandma's 91st birthday and I wrapped her present in this paper right here.  Very shiny.  You see it's like it's got eyes on it.  It's reflective.  I was thinking, why not?  Since the pie plates keep blowing off, why not try to put this in these?  The only thing I can think about with this is perhaps the sun might get these too hot and it might shrivel up inside or something.  And if that happens, you could just use aluminum foil, something else that's shiny.  But we're going to give this a try.  So I like to recycle stuff.  Unfortunately, I've had problems recycling recently.  I tried taking some cardboard.  to the recycle bin and I got a big ticket for that even though it was a cardboard recycle bin and apparently recycling was illegal or something that day.  I didn't see any notice.  So I've decided not to use the recycle bin anymore but I still like to recycle when I can.  So what I'm gonna do here is I'm gonna roll these up, I cut them.  What I do is I put the bottle up here and the paper was twice as wide.  so I just folded it in half like this and just cut it down the edge.  And then I just put the bottle up there and measured and cut again.  What you want to do with this before you roll it up is you want to see which side is shinier.  This is the dull side.  This is the shiny side on this.  What I'm going to do is I'm just going to wrap this up.  Now of course you need to clean all these and dry them out.  And so first of course once you rinse them out, wash them out, you're going to want to let them sit upside down for a while, and then once they don't get any drier, I would just set these in a place where they're not going to catch on fire, where there's some hot air blowing, maybe out of a furnace or something, but off to the side a little bit so they don't get too hot or melt or something.  And that's what I did with these, just to make sure there's no moisture in them.  And so you wrap this up and you just stick this down inside here, okay?  And one thing you might want to do, if you see there's any folds in it where it's not sticking out, you can take something, a knife or something, go in there and just push it out first.  You can tape them together in a circle and then crunch them together and put them down and let them expand.  You can do that too.  But again, why use tape if you don't have to?  If the tape's already on the paper and you can get it off, you can go ahead and use it.  if you can recycle it and get it off the paper.  But, you know, what's the point?  So what I'm going to do with this, since these are plastic, is I'm going to just tie some twine around these necks and then just hang them up.  And the thing is, is that with the metal pie plates and stuff, if I would use twine, eventually either the metal would cut through the twine or if I used glue on the twine, then perhaps it'd just rip out of the metal pie plate because it's thin and it rips and tears.  So with this, hopefully we can avoid that.  There's also another neck here.  if you wanted to tie it here for some reason and have it like maybe at an angle so that the birds could see it better.  Or you can hang it from here, whatever.  So I intend to hang maybe three of these from the chicken coop and then the rest of them right around the yard.  And so I want to try to hang them kind of like this where I've got one tied up here, one tied down here, and one, the third one down there.  And we'll just see how this goes.  And it's all recycled, so if one of them breaks, blows away, whatever, it's not the worst thing in the world.  I can get another one, unless I get a ticket or something for recycling.  I don't know.  I could if one of them broke off and blew away or something.  But anyway, we're going to try that, and we'll see how that works.  You could always weight these two if you wanted to, put something in the bottom, maybe some rocks or something down in between the paper on the bottom.  But I want to keep these clean inside.  Another thing, if you notice that they start getting humid inside while you're hanging them, you can either put something that would absorb the humidity, or you could drill a little tiny hole in the bottom that bugs hopefully can't get up into, and that might help get rid of some of the humidity.  So let's go give this a try. ",

            "text": "Alright, so here we go.  Not only can these scare away dangerous predator birds, they might also attract female human beings as well as they seem to like shiny things as well.  so you know ah One cool thing about having chickens and scaring away predator birds is you attract a whole bunch of little birds.  In fact, I just had a goldfinch follow me around while I was out here and it was still a little bit startled, usually goldfinches are.  But you have a whole bunch of friends.  They want to flock around you, all different species and types of birds all over the place.  So that's something that's a benefit if you like having a lot of birds.  If you don't like bird poop, then I guess you might have a problem.  Anyways, this is one way that you could try to scare away predator birds from your livestock.  And it seems to work.  And we'll see how the shiny plastic stands up to hot sun.  You can also buy this stuff on rolls of tape that they sell as well as wrapping paper.  I'll try to leave some links to that in the description of the video.  As well as possibly maybe some twine.  Please check out my video sponsors.
