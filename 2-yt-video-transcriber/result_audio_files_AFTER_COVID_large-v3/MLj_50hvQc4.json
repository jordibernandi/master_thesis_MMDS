            "text": "Who will be left behind when Christ returns?  It's time to unlearn the lies.  Hey, welcome to Unlearn.  My name is Lex, and I'd like to invite you to join us each week as we unlearn the lies and dig deeper into the truth of God's word.  Now let's get started.  One of the most popular verses used to speak about the rapture is found in Matthew 24, and it speaks about one person being taken while another is left behind.  This is actually where the Left Behind book series got its name.  However, we need to look at the context of these verses to find out who is being taken and who is being left behind.  But as the days of Noah were, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be.  For as in the days before the flood they were eating and drinking and marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark, and did not know until the flood came and took them all away, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be.  Then two men will be in the field, one will be taken and the other left.  Two women will be grinding at the mill, one will be taken and the other left.  Watch therefore, for you do not know what hour your Lord is coming.  Yeshua said his return will be like the days of Noah.  He explained the flood took everyone outside of the ark away, which means the wicked will be taken away when Messiah returns.  This is the exact opposite of what most people teach about the rapture.  Rapture preachers tell us the godly believers will be taken away and the wicked sinners will be left behind.  I don't know about you, but I don't want to be like those who were taken away in the days of Noah.  Yeshua was talking about the judgment and destruction of the wicked at His return.  This is why the book of Revelation tells us that when Yeshua returns, the world will tremble in fear of His wrath.  And the kings of the earth, the great men, the rich men, the commanders, the mighty men, every slave and every free man, hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains, and said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us and hide us from the face of Him who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb.  For the great day of His wrath has come, and who is able to stand?  Remember the parable about the wheat and the tares?  The owner instructed the servants to let the wheat and tares grow together until the harvest.  And notice which is gathered first.  Let both grow together until the harvest, and at the time of the harvest.  I will say to the reapers, First, gather the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them, but gather the wheat into my barn.  The tares are gathered first, not the wheat.  The tares are destroyed and the wheat is gathered into the barn.  This is consistent with what Yeshua said about the days of Noah.  The wicked are taken away and the righteous are left behind.  The Bible consistently describes the wicked as the ones who will be taken away when Christ returns.  Because the godly will remain to join Yeshua in His kingdom, where we will live with him for a thousand years.  and i saw thrones and they sat on them and judgment was committed unto them.  then i saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for their witness to jesus and for the word of god who had not worshipped the beast or his image and had not received his mark on their foreheads or on their hands.  And they lived and reigned with Christ for a thousand years.  But the rest of the dead did not live again until the thousand years were finished.  This is the first resurrection.  Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection.  Over such the second death has no power.  But they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.
