            "text": "Many years ago, I was smitten with a girl from Texas.  I was 23, I think, and she was a couple of years older and she was not available.  She was engaged to marry a friend of mine.  And even if I thought I could steal her away, I wouldn't have tried.  So I kept my feelings to myself.  But one day, for reasons long forgotten, I found myself alone with her in the front room of her airy house on a shady street in Sherman Oaks, California.  We were sitting on the floor of the entryway with a breeze blowing through the screen door and I had a guitar in my hands.  I played her a song I'd just written and we talked about it, what it meant, how it felt.  Then she said, you know, I play guitar a little myself and I've written some songs too.  I had known that her soon to be husband was in a band signed to Columbia Records and what they were doing was usually the topic of conversation.  So I handed her the guitar.  She began to make some chords, but realized that her fingernails were too long to fret the notes.  Dammit, my nails are too long.  I'll be right back.  She jumped up and ran down the hall.  And when she returned, the fingers of her right hand were still tipped with manicure perfect fingernails.  But on her left hand, the nails were cropped right back to the quick.  She took that guitar and played me that song.  I fell in love with her right then and there.  To this day, I wonder what would have become of me if I'd had a woman like that by my side back then, a no-nonsense gal from Texas who knew at a glance what was important.  I've had long visits in Texas several times since that long ago spring day, and I've met a lot of good people.  And I can tell you that on many occasions, I've seen that same attitude toward life.  It's no secret that Texans love a good story.  If you're there a while, you'll hear a lot of tall tales.  You see a certain twinkle in the eye when a Texan embellishes a story to, you know, make it more interesting, or often to turn an ordinary incident into a rough-shod parable.  The place itself seems to be carved out of Western mythology.  Texans love a good yarn, but when the chips are down, expect the blunt truth.  Call it a taste for imaginative mischief balanced by a low tolerance for bullshit.  The Texas mythos unites the state in the same way that Americanism once united all 50 states.  This place actually has its own form of patriotism.  It's a country within a country.  Believe me when I tell you that there are more songs written about Texas by Texans than all songs written about all other states combined.  If you're at a show out there and the band announces their Texas anthem, everybody cheers as if the climax of the evening has finally arrived.  Several times at campfires and song polls, I've made friends with a batch of folks who have rewarded me with this declaration.  Hmm, we're gonna have to make you an honorary Texan.  It's hard to imagine anybody being granted a similar honor in California these days.  Even my liberal friends are embarrassed by what it's become.  To call somebody an honorary Californian would be something of an insult.  Nobody uses the phrase the golden state anymore.  And a U-Haul trailer here is as overpriced as that half million dollar shack you're trying to escape.  There are that many people leaving.  I've listened to Joe Rogan for years.  Doing the podcast from his man cave in Woodland Hills, he sometimes hinted about moving to Texas.  But when the control freaks who run California crushed our culture in response to a virus, he suddenly got serious.  15 days to slow the spread has now lasted so long that he's had time to buy a house, move his family, and build a new studio in Austin.  And we're still locked down, nine months and counting.  Just this past week, Elon Musk announced that he and Tesla were leaving their Silicon Valley home for the state that thinks of itself as a country.  A lot of SpaceX is already there.  If we're talking about natural beauty, let's be honest.  Texas ain't no California.  And anybody who spent a summer there and then one in, say, San Diego, will not be confused about who has the better weather.  In terms of raw potential, no place in the country can touch California.  So the exodus out of here might surprise some people.  Even if you count the illegal entry of immigrants, more people are now leaving California than coming into California.  And that worries a lot of Texas conservatives.  They assume that every worker who follows their employer to Texas is a progressive who will immediately get to work, ruining their beloved state.  But I see the role of Texas as unique, and I think that Texas will remain Texan.  The exodus out of California is driven by the search for common sense.  California doesn't have it, and Texas does.  Business is leading the Texas exodus, not wokeness.  Ultimately, progressivism will be no match for Texas-ism.  Look at Beto O'Rourke, not a Californian.  Two years ago, he raised 6.1 million on the first day of his campaign.  But with all his talk about rounding up guns and relaxing the border, it wasn't long before the money dried up and Beto dropped out.  What's he doing now?  He's teaching one course for Texas State to 25 students on Zoom.  The Texas congressman most likely to become president is Dan Crenshaw.  He hits the right note every time.  He's a solid pro-business conservative with great crossover appeal.  And Ted Cruz has transformed himself from the guy who Beto almost beat to the much hipper dude he is now.  Both of these guys understand the new conservative cool that's been developing in thousands of long-form conversations across the podcast universe.  And the topic of these discussions is more often than not what has happened to the Democratic Party.  For this whole year, America has been one long display of the chaos that progressives create when they get the upper hand.  That's not gonna happen in Texas, which is not to suggest that liberalism will be eradicated there.  Let's talk for a second about Willie Nelson, because in some way, Willie symbolizes the attitude I wanna get at.  When Willie started throwing his annual concerts in Lukenbach 40 years ago, I marveled at the sight of the crowds, hippies and rednecks side by side on stage and off.  I was confused by this being from California.  I thought this was a never the twain shall meet kind of thing.  But both these tribes love fun and freedom and music brought them together with no problem.  I gradually realized that what Waylon and Willie and the boys were doing was not a fluke, but a model.  They set up a whole branch of country music in Texas that communicated across ideological boundaries in ways that Nashville didn't.  Outlaw country could not have been born any place else.  First time I drove from LA to the Texas Hill Country, I was staggered by how big the state is.  When I finally reached the ranch where the Kerrville Folk Festival was being held, I was worn out.  As I set up camp, a couple of folks from San Antonio came over to lend a hand.  Hearing that I was from California, they asked what I thought of Texas.  I remember what I said because my remark was met with laughter.  I said, well, it's roomy.  And it is very roomy, and not just physically.  There is a largeness to Texas culture.  Years later, I learned that the man who founded that folk festival was a Republican.  He presided over that beautiful meeting of creative spirits for decades, knowing full well that a lot of the people he put on his stage saw the world through a different lens.  He knew that folkies from places like Woodstock and Boston would spout progressive slogans from the stage he built.  But he put up with that just as the good conservative people of Kerrville, the town, put up with the people who come every year to Kerrville, the festival.  That's kind of the job of grownups, isn't it?  There is only one reason why people of a liberal outlook fight with people of a conservative outlook, and that reason is intolerance.  If you can stand for people to view the world differently than you do, you can work with them.  After all, isn't that what freedom means?  When I first started visiting Texas, I was newly sober and pretty beat up.  I was trying to clear my head and figure out what I really thought about how best to live.  I was filtering through a lot of ideas, things I'd adopted in my rebellious left-wing youth and the things my conservative parents had taught me by example.  Seeing musicians of both stripes getting along so well has stayed with me.  It's taken me a while, but I can imagine a world where these ideas live in some sort of balance.  Humor helps a lot with that.  I used to have a favorite quip.  I'd say, I want to sleep with a liberal, but I want conservatives running my town.  Sounds like something a Texan would say.  Places like Austin and San Antonio and even Houston and Dallas have pulled Texas into the sort of ideological push and pull that used to go on here back when California was as vibrant as Texas is now.  When new ideas mingle freely with old school common sense, you get advancement with its feet firmly planted on the ground.  You get things like SpaceX, imaginative mischief with a low tolerance for governmental bullshit.  Call me an optimist, but I don't see Texas becoming the new California.  There's just too much.  live and let live out there, too much to each his own.  Both Joe Rogan and Elon Musk live with one foot in each world.  And just as Rogan is the single most important figure in the new media, Musk is the single most important figure in free market capitalism.  Both have a curiosity and sense of adventure that keeps them open to great ideas no matter who thinks them up.  But without exception, Rogan calls out woke ideology every time.  And how long did it take for Musk to challenge the insanity of shutdowns in California?  Liberalism is not the problem.  Woke progressivism is the problem.  It's fitting that these guys have moved their center of gravity to Texas.  My instinct is that the two of them and the many others who will follow will do much to make us realize that the best ideas going forward will not spring from tightly controlled ideological bubbles.  That in fact, such one party dominance leads to entropy and decay.  California will continue to serve as proof of that for decades to come.  If Willie Nelson with his long hair and braids could share a microphone with the Okie from Muskogee and they could beam at one another in true friendship, we can all reestablish respect across the divide.  But that will not take place in California or Massachusetts.  That will take place in Texas.  Because one thing about the Lone Star State, it's roomy.  If you're still with me, follow me over to my other channel and I'll sing you Guy Clark's classic song about escaping LA.  Thanks a lot. ",
