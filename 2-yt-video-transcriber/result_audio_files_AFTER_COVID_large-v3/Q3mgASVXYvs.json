Here is Bernie Sanders going to push the notion, and particularly in light of what Joe Manchin is saying in this instance, where Joe Manchin has come out so strongly against $2,000 checks.  But here is him seeking leverage, but Here is Bernie Sanders basically going to function to push the Democrats to wield power.  I mean, ostensibly, right?  One of the reasons why Bernie Sanders is still going to be in the Senate as opposed to Labor Secretary, Marty Walsh has been named Labor Secretary, is because they want to maintain control of the Senate.  Well, if you're going to maintain control of the Senate, use it.  Use it.  Here is Bernie Sanders on CNN. ",

            "text": "Let me just be very clear as the incoming chairman of the Senate Budget Committee.  I remember what happened in 2010.  And that is the Democrats during the 2008-2010 period controlled the White House.  They controlled the Senate, controlled the House.  You remember that?  And you remember what happened in 2010?  Democrats got wiped out.  They had the power, but they did not deliver for the American people.  So what we have got to do right now, no ifs, buts, or maybes, is have an aggressive agenda that says we understand that millions of people, including my neighbors right here in Vermont, people lining up in their cars in order to get emergency food.  People can't pay their medical bills.  People are going deeper and deeper into debt.  People are facing eviction.  Millions of people have lost their jobs.  We have to act and act now.  And the first order of business, by the way, is to pass an emergency COVID-19 bill, which, among many other things, says to working class Americans, we know you're in pain, and we're going to get you a $2,000 check for every working class adult in this country.  We are on your side.  We are prepared to take on the big money interests who have so much power.  We're going to expand health care to cover the uninsured.  We're going to deal with student debt.  We have got to be bold in a way that we have not seen since FDR in the 1930s. ",
