After a surprising third-place finish in the New Hampshire primary, Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar is attempting to gain ground in the national polls.  But Klobuchar is facing mounting scrutiny over her record as a district attorney in Minnesota.  The Minneapolis NAACP, Black Lives Matter Twin Cities and other racial justice groups recently called on Klobuchar to suspend her presidential campaign.  following a shocking investigation by the Associated Press.  The AP report centered on the case of Mayan Burrell, an African-American teenager who was sentenced to life in prison over the 2002 murder of 11-year-old Taisha Edwards.  Klobuchar led this case against Mayan Burrell when she was Hennepin County's district attorney.  But the AP report says she may have mishandled the case and that Burrell could be innocent.  The Associated Press report shows how prosecutors had no DNA or fingerprints tying Burrell to the murder and that they relied on jailhouse informants, some of whom have since recanted their testimonies.  Burrell has always maintained his innocence.  On the campaign trail, Klobuchar has cited the jailing of Burrell as one of her achievements.  She brought up the case during a debate in September. ",

And he was denied that opportunity to even consult with his mother.  He has maintained his innocence from the beginning.  And in spite of that information, Amy Klobuchar has exploited this case.  She has exploited the tragic death of Taisha Edwards, the 11-year-old child who was killed in this situation through an accidental shooting outside of her home.  And she exploited Mayan Borrell, using his name or using this case repeatedly throughout her career and to bolster her career.  As a matter of fact, when she ran for the Senate in 2006, she put forward a commercial that included Taisha's mother and other victims of crime, demonstrating that she was tough on crime.  I do not feel that she has any remorse.  what she did to Mayan and the impact upon his family and the community.

No, Amy Klobuchar did not allow Mayan Burrell to attend his mother's funeral, claiming that he was a threat to public safety.  I have seen people who are incarcerated in prison be allowed to leave prison and go and pay their last respects to their family members at funerals, but Amy Klobuchar denied a child this opportunity.  Mayan Burrell has continued to maintain his innocence.  The co-defendants in this case have come forward, in particular the person who pulled the trigger back several years ago, saying that Mayan Burrell was innocent and taking responsibility for the crime, but his words have fallen upon deaf ears.  And so Mayan continues to pay the price, having been locked up for roughly 18 years for a crime that he did not commit. ",

We are seeing similarities in terms of the way that Amy Klobuchar conducted herself as a prosecutor and the way that she is responding to this case.  Instead of accepting responsibility, acknowledging her mistakes and rolling up her sleeves to help set Mayan free, she is continuing to sidestep these questions, absolve herself of responsibility and minimize the significance of sending an innocent black teenage boy to prison for life.

And so she had a very close relationship with police.  The black community called her out consistently for not holding police officers accountable.  As a matter of fact, a shooting of a teenager happened in 2004.  And that teenager's mother sent Amy Klobuchar a letter asking her to not use a grand jury and to charge the officers who killed her son.  Amy Klobuchar did not even respond to that mother's letter.
