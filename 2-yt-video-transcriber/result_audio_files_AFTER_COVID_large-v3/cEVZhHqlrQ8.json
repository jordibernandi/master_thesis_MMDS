            "text": "The IMF wants credit scores tied to your internet search history.  Let's have a look.  Hello everyone, Florian Heiser here and welcome to another episode of Heiser Says.  Grab your stein of coffee and let's have a look at this article which is discussing a recent blog post from the IMF, the International Monetary Fund, in which, among other things, they're suggesting tying your credit score to your internet search history.  It just feels like it's going to evolve into the slippery slope argument of social credit scores.  Where if you're behaving correctly, if your opinions are appropriate, you will get credit.  You will be allowed to buy and trade.  If you think these right thoughts, if your Twitter history is correct, you'll be allowed to do business.  It really feels like that, doesn't it all?  Well, there seems to be some historical precedent, some warnings from previous civilizations about these issues, doesn't there?  So let's have a look at this.  In a blog post, courtesy of the International Monetary Fund, IMF researchers Arnoid Boot and Peter Hoffman, Luke Levin and Lev Ratnovsky called for internet search history to be tied to credit score.  Would you like your internet search history tied to your credit score?  I mean, I just found out my Fitbit that I use to track my steps, it's now owned by Google.  So that's going to be more data that Google has.  There you go.  Presenting their findings from a paper they wrote, the researchers argue that by using non-financial data, specifically the history of online searches and purchases, we can solve the problem of certain kinds of people not having enough hard data, income, employment, time, assets, and debts available.  So... some people who can't get a credit score they want to create a way to give you a credit score.  they want to open up.  open up the world of debt and indirect enslavement to everyone.  fantastic isn't that great?  wow oh so.  you can get into debt through your search history and stay in debt for your whole life because then you're a managed population.  The authors of the piece claim that this move is a necessary innovation in order to compete with the rise of corporate cryptocurrencies such as the one in development by Facebook, who hope to launch next year.  Now that's interesting.  So the IMF are seeing the corporate cryptocurrencies as a threat.  Now, that could be good.  You want competition in this instance.  I would like less intervention in the economy, but having some corporately backed cryptocurrencies competing as a monetary system, fantastic.  The more, the merrier.  You just don't want them all to work together.  And we've got that now.  We've got that now.  A messy situation with central banks.  What would you rather, everyone, if you had to pick a fiat currency?  Would you rather go Bitcoin?  Would you rather go a fiat currency by a different reserve bank?  Or would you go a cryptocurrency from a corporation that's tied to a basket of other currencies?  That Facebook coin could have been very innovative.  It's easier to get a Facebook account than it is a bank account for some people.  There are a whole lot of people that are unbanked.  and being unbanked is a big issue.  That's the one real innovation I see with regards to crypto that can provide access for many more people to banking facilities quite easily.  The only problem is the costs for small transactions are still too high.  It'll be interesting to see if there's some innovation there, or if the central banks will push out their cryptocurrencies.  Then the danger is they'll be centrally controlled, and then that gives them another way to manage.  control and manipulate the economy.  Tie that to your social credit score, that's another risk.  While Facebook is a monopoly that is engaged in political censorship, their power pales in comparison to that of the IMF.  The International Monetary Fund is a veritable superpower with ties to the World Bank and they oversee the entire global economy.  It should go without saying that giving this organization the power to track everyone's search history can lead to some dark ramifications, with private banks, notably JP Morgan and Chase Bank, already kicking conservatives off their services.  One can only imagine how much this would escalate with the IMF tracking everyone's search history.  I mean, this is a potential dystopian nightmare.  That's what it is.  And this is only a blog post.  It's only a research paper.  It's only an idea.  It's not going to happen next month.  But it's something that we need to be aware of and people need to say, this is a risk of this proposal in a calm and sensible manner.  Don't worry, the sky isn't falling quite yet.  And the fact that we do have conservatives being, well, deplatformed, that will... That can result, and I'm hoping it will, in a hardened, more diverse system of social media and other competitors in the transaction sphere.  That's what we need.  If they're stupid enough, I mean, look at Twitter.  I mean, let's have a look at the Twitter share price.  Look at that.  We'll look at the Twitter share price.  I mean, there you go.  Still hasn't paid a dividend.  Still hasn't paid a dividend.  There we go.  Look at that.  From $54 a month ago to $45.  So they're losing.  Let's jump out to a year.  So they didn't really cop much of a hit at the beginning of the year, did they?  They've been climbing up.  Now they're going back down.  So... While there has been bipartisan opposition to the Chinese social credit system in Congress, the distinctions between that system and what the IMF is pushing for remains ill-defined.  The IMF, including some of the writers of the blog post, have ties to both the World Economic Forum's Great Reset Initiative and the Joe Biden transition team.  Two of the researchers advocating for the IMF tracing out search history, Luke Levin and Lev Ratnovsky, have pages on the WF website.  Lev Ratnovsky in particular has defended bank bailouts so the economy can stay afloat.  Well, fantastic.  These are the type of people that you want mingling with the elite and influencing your civil servants.  Because this is the problem.  You can see, particularly with the UN and the WF, you get these organizations and then our civil servants will go off there and they'll go to their events, they'll feel special, they'll read the books, they'll learn the ideas.  And then it filters all the way down.  So that's why you could advocate for politicians that go to Parliament and try to publicly get a public motion put that Australia will not back the Great Reset and no one votes for it.  Except for Hanson and Roberts.  Meanwhile, the head of the IMF, Kristallania Georgieva, have publicly advocated for the Great Reset Initiative, notably in this speech to members of the Royal Family over the summer.  The Great Reset Initiative is a plan by the World Economic Forum to, in their words, build a new social contract that honors the dignity of every human being.  Here is one hypothetical scenario proposed by the WF contributor for what life may look like after the Great Reset.  One slogan employed by the WF and proponents of the Great Reset, build back better.  See, this is the thing.  Why do we want a new social contract?  I mean, are we even happy with the current social contract that a lot of us are a party to?  See, this is the thing.  A contract, there needs to be an agreement between two parties.  You can't be forced to enter into a contract under duress.  And there needs to be reasonable time to consider.  There needs to be consideration of a contract.  There isn't any of these things in a social contract.  It is put upon you through no choice of your own.  Just by the chance of where you're born.  Some countries you can have a better social contract than others.  And future leaders can burden future generations with never having to pay the price.  Doesn't seem fair, does it?  Fantastic invention though.  Politicians can get all the glory and don't have to pay any of the price, none of the burdens.  The danger is it leads to a very weak society and civilization.  So the WF has used the slogan as shorthand for reinventing capitalism.  The slogan has also been used by Joe Biden.  who George Yava's associates say will help advance the IMF's goals as president.  Biden has also promised he will establish a task force to combat online extremism.  Well, this is the problem.  What do people consider extreme?  I saw something on Twitter that was so stupid.  Someone actually considered in the States that AOC was centrist.  Just think about that.  That's what some people think.  That shows you how far the Overton window has shifted in some people's minds, or how little an understanding some people have of reality.  Given Biden's ties to groups such as the IMF and WF, this could be cause for concern.  A Democratic president and anti-conservative banking institutions using big tech to monitor people's search history isn't the most comforting idea, to say the least.  And I think that certainly is a very good consideration.  So there we have it, guys.  What do you think?  Are you concerned that this is the first step?
