Folks, I've been kidding about Joe Biden and his apparent cognitive decline for a while now, but it's really getting to the point where you can't even joke about it anymore.  Hey everyone, I'm Steve Green with Bill Whittle and Scott Ott, and this is Right Angle, brought to you by the members of BillWhittle.com.  Gentlemen, two clips came across my desk just in the last few days of Joe Biden.  Keep in mind, this guy is not out campaigning anymore.  The big events are non-starters.  He's at home.  He's recording from the safety of his living room or whatever.  These are controlled circumstances.  He gets to take as many naps as he wants or whatever it is he's doing.  These are the ideal circumstances for a man of his age with, well, he was never that sharp to begin with, and now it's like, I don't know, sawing a rawhide with a bent ruler.  It's just sad to watch this guy.  Let me show you this first clip.  Just watch this. ",

Yes, every week I do that.  But it's being captured on video.

He's got unlimited time in his basement to say things just the way he wants to say them.  And almost everything he's doing is prerecorded encounters.

I called up our then US, or I'm sorry, he wasn't US Senator yet, but he was running a conservative PAC and I called him up, he later became a US Senator, and I said, I'd like to have your endorsement.  And he immediately started grilling me about things that I might've said or done.  that would be embarrassing.  Like he put me through more scrutiny than they're putting Joe Biden through.

Beau Biden miraculously survives his brain cancer back in 2015 or whatever the year was.  Joe Biden runs for president, wins the nomination from Hillary Clinton in a contested bitter fight, and then being a much more union blue collar friendly candidate than Hillary ever was.  wins Pennsylvania, wins Michigan, wins Wisconsin, and is president of the United States today.

            "text": "We'd be boned.  And this is the kind of question you have to ask yourself, you know, about the people that are propping him up.  And as I said on a Bill Whittle Now show, it's like when I say propping him up, I mean literally like standing behind him and you know, holding him up.  But the bottom line, Steve, is that he's not the president who's suffering from mental illness.  And this is important because When the people are asked to make a decision, they get the candidates that they get.  And it's possible for candidates in the White House to suffer mental decline, physical decline.  You know, Woodrow Wilson was taken out by a stroke.  And that's not the same as electing a guy who's suffering from a stroke.  Do you see the difference there?  I mean, that's really an important difference to see.  To say that we would be in trouble is an understatement, but that kind of misses the point.  The point isn't that clearly Joe Biden is suffering from mental impairment, which is not unusual as somebody his age.  But but rather that they're being asked.  that we're being asked to OK this issue.  Is inconceivable to me.  I think I think Ronald Reagan provides a really excellent example.  I think it's fair to say that in the final years of his presidency, he slowed down a bit, but I don't think he was ever out of touch with reality.  He certainly complete sentences and he knew what he was doing.  He could tell his energy was a little low and he wasn't the guy he was back in 1980.  But you wouldn't expect him to be.  But Ronald Reagan.  had the grace and ultimately the confidence.  And also Ronald Reagan came from a different party.  that was not all about power at any price.  And when Ronald Reagan was diagnosed with Alzheimer's, he basically sat down and wrote a letter to the American people thanking them For allowing him to have been their president, thanking them for the wonderful life that he'd given them, telling him that the doctors have advised him that he's going to be basically losing more and more mental capacity.  And pretty soon he won't know who he is or where he is.  And wishing America good luck and to hang in there and that everything's going to be OK.  And then he rode off into the sunset.  Now, Ronald Reagan didn't die.  A month or a year after he wrote that letter, I think he lived almost another 10 years after that.  Nancy Reagan was particularly emphatic about making sure that almost nobody saw him and certainly that no one photographed him or videotaped him under any circumstances.  And the reason Nancy Reagan did that is.  was because she loved Ronald Reagan enough to know that both she and Ronald Reagan would like for him to be remembered as he was, not as what he became as a result of a disease that he had no control over.  And that was a message of dignity and a message of optimism.  A message of humility is ultimately what it was.  It was a message of somebody who saw themselves as a servant to the public and a person who was temporarily holding vast power And thank you for it as he relinquished it.  It wasn't the sign of somebody was clinging on to this sword until it wrenched out of his hand by disease and old age.  It was a remarkably graceful and elegant and dignified thing to do.  And furthermore, I might add.  Furthermore, it set a fine example for the millions of people who are suffering from this condition, including my own mother.  And I see how this goes.  And it's not going to get better.  It's going to get much, much worse.  And the idea of putting somebody who's suffering like this out there in public in order to humiliate himself \u2013 To to give people.  I disagree with everything he's ever said, and I think he is a bad man politically.  I think he's done some things that I just think are just not just wrong, but just evil is handling of Clarence Thomas and all the rest of it.  I just I do not have a high opinion of Joe Biden, but nevertheless.  He has been in politics for 40 years and to do this weekend at Bernie's thing because he's the best possible path to regaining political power tells me more about the Democratic Party than just about anything else about today's Democratic Party.  And it is not something that I would be proud of.  in fact if if the situation were reversed and and and the republican candidate was being um foisted on us like this as the only chance to beat barack obama or whatever the case may be i would be openly saying this is embarrassing it's degrading and it's dangerous and we are a much better people than this we.  this is a. this is the most cynical thing i've seen in american politics.

So then they have to go with what is the least bad gaffe in order to make this thing into whatever time it needed to be.  And yeah, I mean \u2013 You're exactly right, Steve.  And by the way, if you look at Biden and you look at his series of these kind of lapses he's had for the last several years, but the last year especially, the thing that's most disturbing about this, especially in time of this pandemic, is that the time that Biden gets the most off the rails is when he has to deal with data.  He can get out there and say, Wall Street didn't build this country.  You built that country.  And he gets a cheer for that.  He can deliver that line.  He's been delivering it for 50 years.  But when it comes time to start dealing with data, with specifics, like the preamble to the Declaration of Independence or whatever the case may be, when he has to come up with specific data, he'll start to stumble.  And then the response will always be the same.  And you know what I'm talking about.  That's basically it.  That's the campaign slogan.  Yeah, you know what I mean.  We do know what you mean, unfortunately.  Yeah.  If the Democratic Party actually thinks that this is the best chance they have to beat Donald Trump, and we come to November, and we're talking about numbers, infections, economic rates, recoveries, who did what, when, at what date was this known, it's going to be awful.  I think James Stockdale was a much, much \u2013 oh, I don't think.  I know for absolute moral certainty that James Stockdale was a much, much better man than Joe Biden could ever hope to be.  But watching James Stockdale in the vice presidential debates of \u2013 was it 92, I guess?  Yeah, with Ross Perot.  That man deserved better than that.  He deserved better than being put in that situation after the heroic service he'd given to his country.  And I can't believe people would be this cynical to do this.  Yeah. ",
