If it's your first time here, don't forget to like this video, share this video, and subscribe to the channel if you like what you hear.  Let's get into it.  Now, this is comedian Gallagher.  Now, for those of you who have never seen Gallagher's act, he used to go around the country smashing things on stage.  And he would end his performance with smashing a watermelon at the end of his act.  Is there anyone that particularly does not want me to smash this pig?  Well, then, let's go, right?  So, the head coach of the Dallas Cowboys, his name is Mike McCarthy.  Now, he thought it would be a great motivational tool to get some sledgehammers and start smashing watermelons.  Now, to do this justice, let's listen to Jenny Taft.  Now, listen to the way she describes how the coach for the Dallas Cowboys motivated the team.  Now, this is from a show called Undisputed with Skip Bayless and Shannon Sharp.  Check it out. ",

McCarthy brought several watermelons on the trip to Minnesota, and he spent the team's meeting the night before the game smashing them with a sledgehammer like 80s prop comic Gallagher.  The scene culminated with Demarcus Lawrence smashing a watermelon with Delvin Cook's picture on it.  McCarthy told reporters Monday, it's important to have fun.  The players were into it.
