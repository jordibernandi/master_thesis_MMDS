I feel that it's safe for me not to be wearing a mask and I'm in compliance with CDC guidelines, which are recommended but not required.  Talk about your contacts with the president, what precautions you took.  No one was wearing masks in the room when we were prepping the president during that period of time.  It is being contained.  And do you not think it's being contained?  Late today, we learned that Stephen Miller, senior advisor to the president, has also tested positive.  You spent a lot of time at the White House.  Do you think there's a hole in the system there now? ",
