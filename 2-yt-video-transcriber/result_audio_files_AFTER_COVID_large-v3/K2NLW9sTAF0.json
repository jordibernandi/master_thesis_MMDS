            "text": "Hey, I just wanted to do a quick update.  As you've probably noticed, I've changed my YouTube name.  This channel has grown way bigger than I ever thought it would, and I felt like it's about time to not have Kuk in the name anymore.  Janusz Cieka, as it's pronounced, is my pen name.  It's Lithuanian.  You might have also noticed that I have gotten a new microphone.  I hope it sounds better.  Anyway, I've been away for so long because I've been working on my master's thesis and then my book, which should be released sometime this year on Repeater Books.  I'll make an announcement video once it's been released.  The book will center on Marx and Nietzsche, and it'll discuss philosophy and human emancipation through their writings.  It has just entered the editing process, so I'm able to get back into making videos now, and I should have a new video out within two weeks or so, hopefully.  Thank you for your patience, and thank you for everyone's support.  See you soon. ",
