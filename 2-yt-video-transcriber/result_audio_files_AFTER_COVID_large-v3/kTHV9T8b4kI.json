            "text": "I often wish I had listened far more attentively to my history teacher in Yorkshire.  His name was Norman Salmon.  He was an interesting man.  And he taught us well, and if I had only listened as much, I would have realized that the older days that history teaches us that history teaches us nothing is just a silly idea.  And especially at the moment, as we encounter these circumstances that are apparently vastly different from anything we've ever known, what I've found interesting is going back into history and discovering, for example, that the cholera plague during the time of Spurgeon in the Victorian era was as real and as impactful as what we're facing now.  And the advice that was given on a medical basis is largely the same, and the counsel, for example, of the pastor was what I would want to counsel with today.  And if you go further back than that to the seventeenth century and to Luther, if you read Luther on the plague, it's quite fascinating, because amongst all of the things he says, he says, make sure you wash your hands, make sure you don't gather together in big crowds, and make sure you say your prayers.  So there really is nothing new under the sun.  And yet, the story of the gospel is as new as tomorrow morning's news.  I commend it to you. ",
