Do you know what a public easement is?  Do you know what a public easement is?  And besides, if it's federal property, that is... That's not true.  What about the dash cams?  You know the Google car came through here.  So, when the dash cams come on, we make them take it down, okay?  You understand that?  So they can't report on those things.
