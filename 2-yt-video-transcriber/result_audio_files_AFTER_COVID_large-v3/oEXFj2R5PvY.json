So their thing is they have this bizarre approach to reverse engineer everything like, Hey, if, if a lot of young black teens are being suspended from schools, then stop suspending young black teens.  It's like, okay, that's not going to fix anything.  If, if, If homelessness is illegal, then don't make it illegal anymore.  Like in Gaston, it's that way too.  It's like the prisons are overcrowded.  How do we fix that?  Let everyone out of prison.  Well, that obviously doesn't fix, you know, 75% of the kids can't do math at grade level.  Well, then lower the test scores.  It's like, okay.  your car's not going fast enough, well then bust the glass of the speedometer and take your finger and turn the needle up to 80 miles an hour.

Imagine trying to pull this shit off in 1955.  Right.  People just be like, no, I'm not staying home.  And by the way, I'm by the way, when I leave my house, I'm taking my gun in case one of you assholes try to try to arrest me like that's where we would be at.

You can't smoke in a restaurant.  OK, well, go to the smoking.  No smoking.  Oh, then I'll go to the bar.  No, no smoking at the bar.  Well, then I'll go to the patio.  No smoking.  Like it's such a crazy Stockholm syndrome that everyone lives.  Everyone who lives in California has a kind of a Stockholm syndrome like.  I say all the time, hey, your business, your restaurant, there's no reason why you need to shut down your outdoor dining.  You've made a lot of concessions.  You spent a lot of money.  Just F these guys.  Stay open.  And everyone's like, I don't want to get into trouble.  Well, that's what the overregulation has created.  This huge sort of umbrella, always under the guise of safety.  And everyone is just scared, but slowly scared.  Like, just think about.  Think about, you know what?  Think about the beach.  I always talk about the beach, but think about the beach.  Like, imagine telling someone from the 50s in Malibu, hey, you can't have that cigarette on the beach.  What are you doing?  I'm drinking a beer.  You can't drink a beer on the beach.  I mean, you look at the sign.  I always tell everyone, look at the sign at the beach.  In the 50s, they didn't have a sign.  at some point it was like no bonfires between 3 a.m.  and 6  a.m.,  you know what I mean?  Now it's like no Frisbee, no dogs, no football, no cigarettes, no- Literally no humans, no humans.  Like literally, yeah, no humans on the beach.  I mean, think about what, Think about how they ratchet it up.  Think about how the sign gets longer.  They always add something to the sign.  They never remove something from the beach sign.  Every year, there's two more things you can't do on the beach.  And when you go physically look at those signs now, it is a scroll.  of things citizens can't do on our beach. ",
