The only thing it does prove is what I'm suggesting, in my opinion.  But what it is, is they shoot a particle or an electron through a double slit, and it will form a wave pattern on a screen behind the double slit if you don't observe it.  But if you observe it, and observing could be a person, it could be a camera.  If you actually observe it, you could see the individual particle form a particle pattern.  So the patterns that it will form will change based on observation.  It's the most interesting thing about quantum physics that people just don't don't don't don't explain.  here's.  the other thing i think it proves is the know all seeing god. ",

And that's what drives me crazy because I don't \u2013 because obviously there's a lot of quantum woo out there of people saying like \u2013 I saw in that book today that I was talking about earlier.  There was some stuff about quantum physics in there.  By the way, did you know there's a quantum university in Honolulu, Hawaii?  Yeah.  Isn't that crazy?  Quantum University.  I want to be a Quantum U alumni.  You think if I asked if they could make me like an honorary thing, I could say I'm from Quantum U because that sounds cool.  Do you think like they're \u2013 I don't know.  I could talk about this all day.  Like their mascots are like the neutrinos or something?  That would be awesome.  I don't know.  That would be cool.  Anyway, side note.  So yeah, like \u2013 You know, people just misinterpret this thing all over the place.  And, Glenn, you're right to point out that, like, there's so many different \u2013 there's as many interpretations to the double slit experiment as there are to, you know, the act of observing the particles, right?  It's not clear.  And certainly the people like us who don't have \u2013 you know, a relevant degree in the field of talking about, shouldn't be even talking about it as well, but the fact that so many other people are talking about it, right, is something that we have to bring up and have to carefully scrutinize.
