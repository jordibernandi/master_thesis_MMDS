So I got something to read the royal family.  Attorney General Daniel Cameron requested extension for releasing Breonna Taylor's grand jury recording.  The release of the recordings of the grand jury presentations in Breonna Taylor's case may be delayed.  Attorney General Daniel Cameron's office filed a motion Wednesday asking the judge for a one-week extension in order to redact the names of witnesses and private citizens, including the jurors for the recording.  The motion was filed at 10.30 a.m.  Wednesday, the same day.  Cameron was expected to release the recordings.  Kevin, I'm just going to say Kevin G because I cannot pronounce this man's last name to save my life.  It's spelled G-L-O-G-O-W-E-R.  The attorney for the jury who filed a motion Tuesday for the release of the recording told Wave 3 News that he thought Cameron's motion was fair.  I'm not surprised, Attorney G said, but that does not change the fact that they need to be transparent, whether it's one week or two weeks from now.  Cameron has said he hopes he does plan on releasing the recording, adding that he is confident in the case he basically has presented.  So... Last night, this super coon, he did an exclusive interview on WDRB.  And I've been telling y'all for the longest, they purposely sometimes, I notice, will record stuff low.  This is a 33 minute and 41 second interview.  interview.  i'm gonna leave the link so y'all can have leisure to listen to it yourself.  it is so damn low but i will play this for the royal family because oh he was mr confident last night.

Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron's office on Wednesday announced that it is moving to delay the public release of grand jury records in the case of Breonna Taylor, whose fatal shooting by police in March has ignited protests across the nation.  Cameron's office filed a motion Tuesday night to delay the release of the grand jury records by a week with the aim of protecting the identities of witnesses, especially private citizens, named in the audio recording.  The recording was originally slated to be released publicly later on Wednesday.  The motion requests to redact personal identifiers of any named person, and to redact both names and personal identifiers of any private citizen.  Jefferson Circuit Court Judge Anne Bailey Smith is expected to rule on Cameron's motion on Wednesday.  Taylor, a black 26-year-old emergency medical worker, was shot eight times in her Louisville, Kentucky, apartment on March 13.  Its police officers executed a search warrant for two men who were known to reside there.  The warrant was issued because police suspected that a man connected to a drug ring was receiving packages containing drugs at Taylor's apartment, but no drugs were found in the botched raid.  Last week, the Kentucky Attorney General's Office announced first-degree wanton endangerment charges against one of the officers who shot into Taylor's apartment.  The officer was not charged with murder, and the other two officers involved in the fatal shooting were not charged.  Hours after the charges were announced on Wednesday of last week, protesters took to the streets in Louisville and set fires, caused property damage, and failed to disperse after being warned, police said.  Two Louisville police officers were shot and sustained serious injuries, and nearly 100 protesters were arrested during the night's demonstrations.  Send a tip to the news team at NR. ",
