We're here today at the University of Florida asking students what they think about these initiatives, but we're not telling them they're Trump's.  Instead, we're telling them that these ideas are Biden's.  Let's see how the students react after finding out that these initiatives are Trump's accomplishments.  So Biden just released his plan for presidency, highlighting some initiatives that he wants to focus on.  I want to get your reaction on some of these.  So the first one is he wants to stop endless wars and bring our troops back home.  How do you feel about that? ",
