This, it seems, is a story on loop, with images of closures, layoffs and empty shop fronts playing on repeat.  But if the high street is dying, what does that mean for a place's sense of self-worth?  And how do people imagine a future when all that's around them are empty shop fronts and the most likely prospect of sustainable work is a delivery depot?  The cliched image of Britain's economy over the last decade is the London skyline, consumers on high streets and news reporters and analysts pointing to graphs going up or more often down.  But that's only a fragment of the overall picture, with the decline of Britain's high street unfolding beyond the view of much of a political and media class whose mental landscape, and mostly physical one too, is disproportionately shaped by our most prosperous city.  That's why we're going to two places on the south coast, Portsmouth and Bournemouth, to look at what's happening to the High Street there and what happens to a place's sense of self-worth when its centre is increasingly identikit and host to ever more empty shop fronts.

One of the ways in which the government is trying to make up for that in terms of funding for councils is by making them more reliant on business rates.  which in one sense is a positive because previously most of the business rates went to central government.

I think we have about 23,000 students in two universities.  And if you take into account they get \u00a35,000 grant, apart from the parents' money, that is \u00a3110 million.  And that is just a grant apart from the parents helping their children.  And that money basically was being spent in local economy, \u00a3110 million.  And without a student, this town will never be the same. ",

There are developers now who are saying we can't fill these buildings with students.  so therefore we need to convert them to private residential accommodation.  And we know with the planning policies as they are, what that allows them then to do is to sidestep any social housing obligation that they would have originally been faced if they built it as private housing, but also space standards or one of those other things that are going to go out of the market.  So we potentially face a quite serious issue with these being then converted further down the line into substandard private accommodation. ",

Students living off loans are paying to live in these places and keeping many high streets in somewhat suspended animation.  If that changes, particularly with COVID, these same buildings could be the future of much private rental accommodation, an area which seems to only get worse.  A failing system on debt, higher education, high streets and housing all appears to be deeply interconnected.  But could something else happen?  Is there a plausible alternative?  Do our city centres have to be like this?  For some, the answer is leaning into the cultural industries and making town centres more appealing as destinations in their own right.  For others, the end of the high street is every bit as big a challenge as the collapse of manufacturing over recent decades.  But what's unanimous is a general status quo that the high street as it is is utterly dysfunctional. ",
