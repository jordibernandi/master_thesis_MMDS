They're still honking their horns for their president.  It's a beautiful thing to see.  And when we drove in, so many, even in a Democrat city, even in a nasty Democrat city, there was so much, I would say, love.  Love, and we can hear it still.  So many.  And the truckers for Trump, we got to thank.  Our Vice President, thank you, Mike, who has done so much unbelievable work at truck stops over the last four years.  So much powerful outreach.  So thank you, Mike.  Thank you.  Dear white American citizens and other people currently in our country who will now have a field day with the radical left presidential agenda of sleepy Joe Biden.  I speak to you tonight to address the results from the first round of presidential voting.  While it seems that I am now behind in the electoral college, This is just the first round of voting.  I will concede that the first round has Sleepy Joe ahead of me by a very small margin, much less than what I destroyed Crooked Hillary Clinton on four years ago.  We now will challenge the results of illegal ballots.  Illegal, okay?  Illegal.  Our democracy you know it, is that we want to support all legal ballots, all of them, every single one.  It would be a horrible thing to see one legal ballot. ",
