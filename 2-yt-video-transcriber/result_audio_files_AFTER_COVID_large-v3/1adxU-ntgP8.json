You raised it at how long it has traditionally taken the Senate to confirm a new justice.  Let's put this up on the screen.  Since 1975, the average has been 40 days from when a president nominates a justice till the Senate holds its first hearing, and 70 days from nomination to Senate confirmation.  We now have 44 days until the election and there has been no nomination by the president yet.  Why the rush to judgment? ",

There could not have been a clearer mandate because the American people didn't just reelect Republicans.  They expanded our majority.  They defeated four Democratic senators who voted against Justice Kavanaugh.  They reelected the one Democratic senator who did vote for Justice Kavanaugh.

Joe Biden's not going to do that.  Joe Biden still refuses to even identify who he might nominate.  And Joe Biden and Senate candidates like Cal Cunningham in North Carolina and Theresa Greenfield in Iowa need to put their cards on the table.  They need to say what they would do in this kind of nomination. ",

            "text": "So that was Chris Wallace absolutely grilling Tom Cotton earlier today on Fox News over his Supreme Court hypocrisy.  Basically, Tom Cotton is arguing that Donald Trump has the right and the duty and the responsibility to replace Ruth Bader Ginsburg.  Whereas back in 2016, he opposed even a vote on Obama's Supreme Court appointee, Merrick Garland, arguing, among others like Ted Cruz and Mitch McConnell and Lindsey Graham, that a president in their final year, a president in the year before an election does not have the right to appoint someone.  And that point, that appointment should be held over till after the election when the new president can make the pick.  Now they're arguing that actually what matters is if the parties match or not.  That's what Ted Cruz said earlier today when he was on the news.  He basically said to George Stephanopoulos, look, when the parties match, you know, the president and the Senate can agree on a pick most of the time.  When the parties diverge, they rarely do.  But that's not making an argument about what's right or wrong.  That's making an argument about how easy it is to put someone on the court when the Senates don't match.  So Ted Cruz isn't actually providing any sort of precedent saying it's easier versus it's harder.  In 2016, the Republicans didn't make an argument about blocking Merrick Garland in particular, and they didn't have him up for a vote and they didn't have a confirmation and reject him.  They said explicitly in the final year.  There shall be no appointment.  They didn't refer to how it's harder in a final year.  They didn't refer to how they didn't like this particular nominee.  And then Obama ran out of time.  They said there shall be none.  And now this time they're arguing that because their Senate has been elected to make this decision, they have the responsibility and there's no hypocrisy.  But we have to look at a few factors here.  One, the Senate is horribly imbalanced and it does not reflect the will of the American people.  It's bad enough that on its own, the Senate, which is, again, horribly imbalanced, can hold the Supreme Court up. ",

            "text": "of the matter is, is in 2018, which Tom Cotton and Ted Cruz were referencing as giving them the mandate to block a Supreme Court nominee or to put one on the court, more people voted for Democrats in the Senate than voted Republican by large margins because of the horrible imbalance.  And again, you could say that's the rule of the game and it is.  But if you're going to be making a moral mandate, not just a legal one, but a moral one, certainly the party that got more votes in the Senate, the Democratic senators have more votes than your senators.  I think that questions your mandate.  It puts your mandate morally, intellectually into question.  And I also think it's a little inappropriate that both Tom Cotton and Ted Cruz are commenting here.  Because both of them are on the presidential shortlist.  And if it turns out they're not the pick, if it turns out that he goes with somebody else, then fine, have them comment.  But as long as they're on the shortlist... as long as they're potentially going to be Trump's pick, because that's what Trump has said, these men are being considered, as long as that's the case, I don't think it's appropriate, and I think it's a huge conflict of interest for them to be commenting on whether or not it's right or hypocritical or appropriate to appoint somebody to the Supreme Court right now.  I'm under no illusion that this is actually going to solve anything.  I'm under no illusion that appeals to hypocrisy are going to defeat Republicans and make them reconsider their position.  Republicans don't care about hypocrisy.  They don't.  They just don't care.  What's going to flip any Republican is self-interest.  What's going to flip moderate republicans as they're afraid of losing maybe two or four years from now?  what's going to flip even other people is my god i could lose my seat.  that's what's going to flip them.  but it's good to point this out because they don't care.  and the most shocking thing of all here is that tom cotton plays his card by not playing his card when chris wallace asks him In a lame duck, let's say after November, Trump loses, you lose the Senate.  Losing his entire argument, which is that the people have rejected your Senate majority and have rejected your president, will you still appoint someone?  And he doesn't say yes because he wants to say yes, but it tears down his entire argument.  They don't care.  It's not about majorities.  It's not about who's president.  It's not about parties coalescing.  It's about power.  Republicans use it because they play dirty.  Now, here's the thing.  Will Democrats do the same for good for once? ",
