Dude's got a stick so far up his butt that he gets splinters when he swallows.  Let's do this.  Greetings fellow space travelers, Bionic Dance here.  Before we start today's video, I find I must apologize for part of yesterday's video.  I said the guy to whom I was responding was Rusty Walker, and it wasn't.  Rusty was someone who had also made a response.  I got mixed up on what page I was on and used the wrong name.  Totally my bad.  So, sorry.  Anyway, yes, I watch the Super Bowl.  But I'm not sports people at all.  Not really.  Thing is, when I was an Xbox tester at Microsoft, they made me play NFL Fever 2002 for, like, a week.  And rather than hating it, I started to appreciate the game on at least a rudimentary level.  So once a year, I watch a game.  The Super Bowl.  And since that's the only time I'm paying attention, I pick who's gonna win based on whose helmets I think are prettiest.  It's a thing.  And as a result, I watched this year's sexy as hell halftime show.  Not really the biggest fan of JLo or Shakira.  Don't hate them.  Don't love them.  It's just not my kind of music.  I could do a whole video series on the music I like and don't like and why, and about the fact that nobody quite seems to understand my taste.  But I found myself enjoying the show.  Apparently, Dave Daubenmire didn't. ",

Pop culture took a hard shift in the opposite direction when I was a kid, with the neon brightness and fun of the 80s changing to the drabness and dark of the 90s with angst and wallowing in pathos.
