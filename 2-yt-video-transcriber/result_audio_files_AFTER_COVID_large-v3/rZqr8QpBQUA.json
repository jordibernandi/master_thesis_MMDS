            "text": "Hi everyone.  So I saw something on Facebook that I wanted to talk about.  There's this video of a UFO that has been declassified by the U.S.  Department of Defense.  I think it was declassified back in January or something.  But I saw it on Facebook recently and I wanted to discuss it.  I'm not actually going to have a look at the video.  I'm not going to play it.  It's not relevant to what I'm going to talk about here.  What I am going to talk about is the context in which I found this video.  It was a discussion on Facebook and in the comments people were saying how ridiculous it is that scientists are still denying that we're being visited by aliens.  And what they're saying is that it's unscientific to accept the explanation it's aliens.  Given this video that has been declassified by the American Department of Defense, and apparently the person who caught this footage has said he believes this is an alien spaceship.  I mean, there you go, right?  And I have seen links to videos debunking it, saying what it is, but that's not really relevant to what I'm going to be talking about here.  So I'm not going to weigh in on that.  I'm going to say, let's accept that what we have here is a genuine UFO, an unidentified flying object.  The reasoning that you are labeling as unscientific, those of you in the comments, is I don't know what this is.  We can rule out this, this, this, this, this.  We can rule out a hell of a lot of things.  I have no idea what's left on the list of things that could explain this.  But I'm going to say that we can ignore every option remaining, even ones I can't think of, other than it's aliens.  That is an argument from ignorance fallacy.  And you are saying that it would be unscientific not to accept this reasoning.  So I want to turn that around on you and ask you this.  You know, one thing you haven't ruled out is that it's a camera glitch.  Now, I know, because the footage shows this thing moving in a very specific way.  It's just... I'm assuming it's not something that you could explain.  You know, it's a dead pixel which moves with the camera.  It's nothing like that.  So, camera glitch.  That sounds like an absurd idea.  Well... Here's the question, though.  What if I could take that camera, or a similar camera, the same model, and I could reproduce that camera glitch?  And show you that under certain lighting conditions, once you loosen this particular wire inside it, you get this weird thing that looks like a UFO.  I mean, no matter how stupid that sounds, if I could reproduce the glitch, that would make it a very plausible explanation, wouldn't you agree?  And I don't mean like I have to reproduce it by doing something specific to artificially create this glitch.  I'm simply talking about A loose wire causes this.  Or when light enters the lens from a certain angle it messes with the light sensor and the camera goes nuts.  this happens.  And when you move the camera around, of course, the angle of the incoming light will be different.  So it looks like it moves independently of the camera.  It sticks there when I move the camera back and forth.  If I could reproduce that glitch, would you regard that as a plausible explanation?  I'm pretty sure you would.  I'm giving you enough credit that you actually, I'm assuming that you actually care about what's true.  I suspect some of you don't, but let's assume that most of you do.  If someone used that camera and captured this footage, would you believe it was aliens or would you believe it was a camera glitch?  Hey, I caught videos of aliens with this camera.  Oh, what kind of camera is it?  It's one of these.  yeah we know about the glitch.  that's that's how you would react right again if the glitch can be reproduced.  that's the problem.  if I took if the glitch could not be reproduced the way you can't reproduce aliens then it wouldn't be very scientific of me to say oh well we ruled out everything else.  it must be a camera glitch right you wouldn't accept that.  You wouldn't accept, well, what else could it be?  Aliens?  Any more than I will accept.  It has to be aliens.  What else could it be?  A camera glitch?  That's the problem.  Reproducibility.  Show me aliens under some sort of controlled conditions, and then I will take you seriously.  Not before.  There has to be something that can be reproduced.  Can I go there and video that same thing myself?  Can people come back to that same place later, because that's a place where aliens often visit?  That's how we find new types of animals.  Someone spots a new animal somewhere.  OK, well, others, you know what?  It lives over here.  So others can come back and see for themselves that, yes, this thing really does exist.  But there's no way to reproduce UFO sightings.  And that's the problem.  It's a camera glitch that can't be reproduced.  So it becomes a convenient excuse.  That's it.  why you don't accept the camera glitch?  explanation, then you understand why the rest of us don't accept the aliens explanation.  See ya. ",
