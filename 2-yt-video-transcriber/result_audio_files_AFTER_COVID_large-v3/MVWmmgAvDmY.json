            "text": "Insider had an awesome report where one of their reporters went to a rural area of Eastern Virginia, an area that is quite conservative, went heavily for Trump in 2016.  And the reporter talked with some people who have long been Trump diehards, real loyalists.  And the reporter said that as he was going around talking to these people, he noticed that this was an area where from 2016 on, you could see Trump signs all over the place.  And they lasted year after year, but they've become more rare.  And that sort of tacks with what he got from some of these people he talked to, the big Trump supporters.  So I wanna go through a few of these.  Now understand it's anecdotal, but it is interesting what it might have been that finally got through to them.  So Cliff, a 25-year Chesapeake Bay waterman says, a few weeks ago, I could ignore the parts of his personality I didn't like.  That's over.  I don't believe anything he's saying now.  And indeed, the lies have, they've become pretty terrible.  And the consequences of the lies are far more obvious, Brett. ",

He goes on to say he believes Trump initially played down just how bad the infection and death rate would be, while contradicting the advice of his own experts and guidelines from the federal government.  And so, Yeah, those are just two people, bear in mind, we're gonna have more in a second.  And again, it is the most anecdotal of anecdotes.  But I do think that the fact that the lies are so clearly, obviously, and quickly connectable to actual deaths, it at least gives it a chance of breaking through in a way that his other lies perhaps never have.

And I welcome it.  I welcome it.  I welcome anyone who looks around and sees evidence of something.  And every logical bone in their body would say, I believe that evidence.  It should lead me to a conclusion.  Versus then looks over at Trump and sees him giving them the BS and then says, all right, that's enough.  That first quote, I could ignore the parts of his personality I didn't like.  That's over.  And in a Trump of personality \u2013 Trump of personality \u2013 in a cult of personality \u2013 That's what I like to hear, people saying the personality, it's too much.

Now that's not to say it's gonna get through everybody.  There are people who drank the Kool-Aid after all, but hopefully it will.  And I wanna give a little bit more information from the insider report.  You should definitely track this down and read it.  So a recent Centers for Disease Control mailer titled President Trump's Coronavirus Guidelines for America was widely mocked among locals here as nothing more than flimsy campaign propaganda.  Government instructions to help prevent the virus's spread that Trump himself seemed to undermine.  And a little bit more from Matt, who said, Matt told me he's always disagreed with Trump's attacks on immigrants.  Quote, a lot of the guys in shucking houses around here are Hispanic migrants, and they're really good guys, hardworking guys.  But through it all, from the Muslim ban to impeachment, he stuck with him.  Now the trust is gone.  Quote, he thinks we're all stupid and will show up for him no matter what.  At this point, I can't imagine bringing myself to do that.  And you are right, Hillary Clinton won Virginia by about five points.  This particular county went for Trump by 10 points.  And so for a lot of places, moving 1% or even 3% or 4% of the electorate's not gonna matter.  But maybe for Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, a few states like that, it could be important.  We saw how close it was last time. ",

Um, that is going to be something he's going to hammer down on.  But, and again, sorry I said it that way, but, um, I remember that when I got that like little like postcard in the mail of Trump's advice.  And if you read through it, it was wildly different than what Trump himself was saying, but still had little like echoes that we keep seeing that whenever you.  that plays out so obviously to everybody.  when you watch those those those pressers, which is people are trying to find out which bone they can throw to Trump saying like, OK, I'm still on your team, but still.  And it's so pathetic that they have to do this, convey actual information because their priority is to save people's lives.  And they've had to make that impossible decision, which is like I have to give \u2013 like I have to sacrifice some bits of truth to the Trump Kano.

Yeah, and one thing that I wonder, if on Twitter it might be breaking through, and so I'm asking this to you, Brett, but also to the audience in the chat, is- When he's doing these daily coronavirus pandemic press conferences or whatever, and he's lying regularly.  But then when he goes on Twitter as he did this morning and talked about how the TV ratings are higher than ever before for these.  I that's got to get through to some people that like even someone who watches them and wants to watch them and likes him must think, wait, why are you bragging about the ratings for a disaster response press conference?  What a weird thing to talk about.  That would be like, I don't know, I don't wanna make an analogy because that's how terrible it is.  But he's crossed so many lines, many of which turned out to not even be there.  But there were apparent lines, like mocking the parents of, like Gold Star parents and things like that, mocking POWs.  At some point, he's gonna cross a line for different people.  And I think that bragging about the ratings for something this serious, as the death count continues to climb as rapidly as it is, and that's gotta break through to some conservatives at least. ",
