            "text": "Roger, I did my doctorate work in neurophysiology, and the assumption at the time was that if we're ever going to explain consciousness, it has to be at the level of the neuronal activities.  That's where information seemed to be flowing, it was spiking, maybe there was some generalized electrical activity in the brain that modulated it, but one way or another, that's where it had to be, at the synapse, etc.  You've asked us to consider that real activity is happening at the quantum level.  And I have to ask, why do we need that?  Because quantum effects are everywhere.  Why is it so special in the brain to understand how consciousness works? ",

            "text": "Well, the idea that I had, because of my views about understanding being something which is not a computational activity, I needed something which involved that part of physics which, in my view, had a hope of being noncomputational.  And the only part of physics is that I could think of then and can still think of now is where you have a quantum system which becomes a classical system.  See, this is one of the big puzzles of quantum mechanics.  How is it that you have these rules like Schrodinger's cat being dead and alive at the same time, which are what you get from quantum mechanics, but you don't see them at the classical level.  So there's something missing in the gap between quantum and classical.  The question is how... My argument would be that the physics that is missing about how the quantum world becomes the classical world is something which I... think is the only place where you would have non-computational activity.  So if we think non-computationally, we must be making use of whatever that physics is that goes from the quantum to the classical world.  Now, that's a big, tall order, because it means that in the brain, we have to sustain a quantum system to such a degree that whatever this new physics is, it comes in and becomes relevant.  Whereas usually what happens is the quantum system becomes entangled with the the environment, and you lose all what people call environmental decoherence.  And when that happens, you lose the information that would be relevant in the new physics.  So you've got to keep your quantum system going for that degree so that the new physics actually comes in usefully.  Now, I wrote my book, The Emperor's New Mind, in a way trying to explore this, hoping that by the time I got to the end of the book, what it was.  But I learned various things when I was writing my book about the brain and what people thought about it.  But I didn't get... I simply didn't get a good reason for what... The thing is, neurons.  clearly, at least what I learned about neurons, clearly the firing of a neuron will disturb the environment in the brain and there's no chance of keeping this coherence.  So it needed something more.  So the book was a failure in that particular respect, except... that Stuart Hameroff read my book and he wrote to me and said, I think you may not know about these things called microtubules.  And I said, well, actually, I don't know about them.  In my ignorance, I'd never heard of them.  I thought, you know, is this another nut?  I get letters from various people that I have to discard like this.  But then, you know, here are pictures of them.  Gosh, they must be real.  And so I said, this sounds extremely interesting.  There's a much better chance.  You have these little tubes, they're very symmetrical structures, they're much smaller.  There's a reasonable chance, I didn't see how in detail, but a reasonable chance that here you have something which could preserve quantum coherence up to the level where the new physics would come in.  So, the non-computational behavior, at least there's a chance.  And so Stuart came over to Oxford and we had a long discussion and yes, this sounded like a really promising idea. ",

You see, if you have a quantum, the scheme that needs to modify quantum mechanics, in my view, and I think there are good reasons for this, the modification comes when there is sufficient mass displacement.  So you have a Schrodinger's cat which is alive and dead.  The mass displacement between a dead cat and a live cat is way, way more than you need.  So that just a tiny mass displacement on classical point of view, but from a quantum point of view, it would be a big mass displacement.  That is where you would begin to see the new physics coming in.  The reasons for this come from thinking about general relativity and quantum mechanics and how their principles relate to each other, but let's not go into that now.  But this scale wouldn't be sufficient for a single microtubule.  It would have to be many microtubules within many neurons acting in concert in a certain way.  And so the conscious perception or the conscious willing or whatever it is that comes in at that level would have to involve many, many neurons. ",

So you have to have this global... control or something.  The thing is organized in some global way, so the different reductions of the state actually do make a big difference to what happens to the way the network of neurons acts.

The cat would be superposition of being dead and alive until somebody else comes along and looks at it.  And it's the very act of looking at it, in a sense, which violates the superposition principle and becomes one or the other.  So the consciousness is what does it.
