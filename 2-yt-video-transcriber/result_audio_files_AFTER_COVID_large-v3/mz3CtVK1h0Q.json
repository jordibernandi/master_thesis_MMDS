She has half a million followers and she thinks that the COVID vaccine is a way to implant a microchip, which is the mark of the beast or something?  I guess so that the demonic new world order can track and control you?  It sounds crazy, but none of that is important for this video because what I really want to talk about comes next.  She acts like this is all part of a plot to target and persecute Christians and then starts acting it out with fake ketchup blood and everything.  And then gets almost giddy at the thought of being slaughtered for Jesus.  And before you accuse me of simply highlighting some lone conservative nut, she's hardly alone in this incredibly disturbing martyrdom fantasy. ",

            "text": "Get back.  And in case Jesus wasn't convinced, they've even got fake gore.  If you weren't raised in the church, some of you might think that they're mentally ill, and while I can't speak for them individually, I guarantee you, as someone who used to be just like them, that there are perfectly sane Christians all around the world saying or thinking similar things.  This is just what indoctrination looks like.  You see, I know exactly what's going on inside of the mind of these evangelicals, broadcasting out their martyrdom fantasies, because I used to be just like them.  I wasn't just an evangelical Christian, I was a missionary kid in the Muslim world, whose life revolved around Jesus.  My indoctrination into my faith started before I could read, before I could talk or even crawl.  I was dedicated to God in a church as an infant.  It's not like baby.  me had any say in the matter, and by the time I reached the age of reason, the Bible was systematically ingrained in me.  And I believed it so thoroughly that I would later become a youth pastor, missionary, worship leader, and more.  In church, various pastors growing up would warn us about the impending persecution that awaits Christians in this wicked and sinful world, and admonish us to hold fast to the faith, even if it might cost us our lives.  which, when hammered into you Sunday after Sunday, often accompanied with dramatic music, makes it feel like it's an inevitable certainty.  People who had died for their faith were glorified as heroes.  I was raised on stories of great martyrs like the Apostle Stephen, who was stoned to death for refusing to deny Jesus, and Peter, who was crucified upside down for Christ.  And who could forget Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who were thrown into a fiery furnace for worshipping God and not bowing down to King Nebuchadnezzar?  Only this time, they were actually saved by God.  Captivated by these biblical heroes of the faith, I learned about missionaries like Jim Elliot and four other missionaries who were killed while sharing the gospel with the Ecuadorian Auca tribe, or Vanya, the allegedly totally true story of a Russian soldier who performed miracles, floated out of his body, and was taken to see the new earth God was preparing before eventually being killed for his faith.  My Christian textbooks reverently depicted William Tyndale, who was burned at the stake for translating the Bible into English, although they didn't really dwell on the fact that he was killed by other Christians.  I learned of early church martyrs like Polycarp, Boniface, and the aptly named Justin Martyr.  And if you think the Protestant glorification of martyrdom is over the top, Catholics take it a step further and literally display the bones of martyrs for public veneration.  Wow!  What an exciting prospect!  Maybe if you die for Jesus, your bones could end up in a creepy church somewhere too!  Now, these stories were read to us as kids, and were depicted as worthy, noble examples to live by.  I was taught God's law is higher than man's law, that whoever loses his life for God would gain eternal life, but that this life is meaningless without God, and it's a tragedy to save your life but lose your soul.  And just like that, This precious, rare, and singular life was utterly devalued.  To people not raised in this kind of an environment, it may sound weird, but if I'm brutally honest, there were times when I would ruminate about hypothetical scenarios where I might be asked to choose between my life and my faith, almost like a mental test of fealty to my Heavenly Father, preparing myself in advance for the seemingly inevitable persecution I felt I was bound to face at some point in the near future.  Now, it's not like we were encouraged to go looking for martyrdom opportunities.  I didn't want to die.  I never suffered from chronic depression or suicidal ideation, and I loved living and I still love life.  But the way these stories were told instilled in me a reverence for and almost and excitement about the thought of getting an opportunity to one day lay down my life for Jesus, to show him I was a good and faithful servant of the kingdom of God.  And what better way to show Jesus that I really loved him than to die for him when the time came?  After all, he straight up said, greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends. ",

I'm not saying that Blondie here is going to shoot up a gay nightclub or bomb an abortion clinic, but the mindset laying the pavement on the road to extremism is already in place.  The closest emotion I can compare this kind of brainwashing to is, I remember hearing stories of North Korean refugees who escaped their country's all-encompassing authoritarian dictatorship.  Their entire lives they've been fed lies about the outside world.  Raised on propaganda glorifying their dear leader and savior, Kim Jong Il at the time, to the point where even years later, when they knew it was all bogus, they'd admit that just seeing an image of him or watching a North Korean propaganda video would still tug an emotional cord and elicit feelings of heartfelt yearning.  I was brainwashed.  And like me, most of these TikTok kids aren't suicidal or insane either.  They're brainwashed.  If you want a bit more of an in-depth look at the Christian embrace of martyrdom, I did an entire video on John Allen Chow, the missionary who went to North Sentinel Island to preach the gospel to the indigenous tribe there, knowing full well that he'd likely be executed.  This kind of thinking is an absolute waste, and the result is an utter tragedy.  And millions of kids around the world are fantasizing about it.  But it doesn't have to be that way.
