            "text": "Well, the first thing we have to do, and it's going to sound like avoiding your question, but I see my time is up here.  You're going to hold us tightly, I assume.  I've got to ask you, though.  Sorry, that's our time there.  There's more to say, but my time is up.  And the fact is, we've learned so much more.  Thank you, Mr.  Vice President.  I agree that everybody wants to stay in five days.  Anyway, my time's up.  I'm sorry.  Thank you, Vice President.  Mr.  Vice President, you're the only person I've ever seen on a debate stage say I'm out of time.  Well, look, here's the last point.  I mean, my time is going to run out.  We can do this by making sure that we're in a position that we, in fact, allow people.  We got more questions.  You got more questions.  I tell you, if you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump and you ain't black, it don't have nothing to do with Trump.  You know, that's really our time.  I apologize.  You can't do that.  You didn't answer the question.  Did you make a mistake with those deportations?  The president did the best thing that was able to be done at the time.  How about you, Mr.  Vice President?  We're out of time.  I'm sorry.  Thank you.  Thank you for being here.  It's nice to be with you all.  Have hope, man.  We can do anything in this country.  Well, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden is getting attention for using a teleprompter before answering a voter's question.  I know that there is 60 million Americans saying that they would vote for a union today.  And I would like to know, what will your administration do to help give them that chance?  Thank you.  Let's move it up here.  You know, there used to be a basic bargain in this country.  Workers shared in the wealth their work helped create.  You know, you're used to seeing your political leaders be able to do the Q&A off the cuff.  Look, one of the things that I think is really important is that we somehow put that back on, that somehow we're in a situation where we work together.  In addition to that, In addition to that, we have to make sure that we are in a position that we are... Well, let me go to the second thing.  I know this is a big essay question.  I'm not going to give the whole answer.  An enormous opportunity to build back better.  I'm going to be very short, so I'm not going to keep you standing very long.  Don't worry.  Am I going too long?  We have a little more time.  Okay.  A little less.  You got till six.  Okay.  Or do you want to go next?  No, no, that's good.  I'll go on next.  Okay.  I answered questions.  My problem is I try to answer them thoroughly, but I'll try to do it more quickly.  My tendency is to go on longer and say more to you, but I know time is short for all of you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  We're in deep, deep trouble.  Last point I'll make and my time's, I guess, up.  I'm coming directly to you for ask a quick favor.  Fuck you, Matt.  You're making my cock fall off.  Man, great job, Matt.  He goes by the name Orf.  Wonderful job.  Let's call him Matt-o.  He's the only one butchering his name.  Matt Orfalia.  Matt Orfalia.
