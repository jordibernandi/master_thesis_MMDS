To say that something exists seems to me to mean that it has extension and or location in time and space.  If that's not what existence is, then what does it mean to say that anything exists?  And a mind is a pattern of activity that brains carry out.  To say that a god is a mind which is disembodied seems to me to mean that a god is a pattern of activity that a brain carries out that no brain carries out.  It seems like a contradiction to me.

When such a change occurs, it makes sense to ask what caused it.  However, the beginning of the universe is different because it is also the beginning of time.  There was never a time when the universe did not exist.  Since there was no point in time at which the universe did not exist, there was no change from a point in time at which it did not exist to a point in time at which it does.  If no such change occurred, then there is no reason to account for any such change.  You don't need to explain an event which never occurred.  The beginning of the universe is just a temporal limit, rather than an event at which something comes into existence.  It is not a beginning in that sense.

Since a universe which is even slightly different than the one we have could not support intelligent life, some intelligent being must have deliberately fine-tuned it for that purpose.  There are a few problems with this, but two of the most glaring are ones which undermine the very theology that assumes a God's existence in the first place.  First, God is supposedly all-powerful.  To infer that no intelligent life is possible in a universe with even slightly different parameters implies that God is not capable of creating life in such a universe.  An all-powerful God shouldn't need to fine-tune something for life.  He should have the power to put life in any universe.  Secondly, is God himself not a form of intelligent life?  If he is, then it is clearly not the case that it is impossible for intelligent life to exist without a finely-tuned universe.  Because the existence of God himself is not supposed to be contingent upon any universe, let alone a finely-tuned one.  And if immaterial intelligence doesn't count as intelligent life, life in heaven.  Another reason that fine-tuning is a poor argument is that while we can imagine a universe with different parameters than the one we currently see, we don't actually know for sure that these hypothetical other parameters are equally probable or even possible.  It may be the case that the parameters of the universe have never been free to vary, or that they could only vary narrowly, making this universe's parameters either necessary or at least probable.  This certainly seems to me to be a much more modest and probable inference than the intervention of a timeless, spaceless, disembodied mind. ",

One is, deep down we all know it, which is laughable, and the other is, there are objective moral values because God exists.  Which, as I said, is not going to convince anyone who believes in neither.  Also, even if there is a God who dictates moral values, that doesn't make them objective, because there is still no objective reason why anyone ought to follow them.  Craig sometimes argues that something is moral not because God says so, but rather because it is consistent with God's nature.  But what objective reason is there to do things which are consistent with God's nature?  If there is a reason which is independent of God, then it isn't true that there aren't any objective moral duties without a God.  If the reason why we ought to do what is consistent with God's nature is because doing so is consistent with God's nature, then the argument is circular. ",

Error and embellishment are very probable explanations for claims of a resurrection, both of which make more sense than divine intervention.  Secondly, even if it were the case that Jesus did rise from the grave, it is still a non sequitur to infer that this means that he is the incarnation of a God.  Even if he has the supernatural power to return from the dead, you can't rationally infer from this that he is therefore an all-powerful deity. ",
