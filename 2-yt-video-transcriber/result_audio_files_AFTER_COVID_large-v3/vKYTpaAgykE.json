            "text": "Hello everyone, happy Sunday evening.  So I want to share a quick message that came in from my guides.  So I connect with the Galactic Federation of Light and they showed me a really powerful message that I want to share with you.  I was lying on my floor listening to music and they said, they jolted me out of my like chill state and they said, do you want us to share with you what's going on with humanity right now?  Really important, powerful message.  And I was like, sure.  So I sat up, closed my eyes.  And instantaneously they showed me this.  Now this is what is to come, but of course they didn't give me specifics and anything is possible, but they wanted me to remind all of us that what is coming for humanity is a new leveling up for us in terms of how we show up.  Now we have free will, so you get to choose how you want to be in every now moment.  But the next leveling up for a lot of us is to start to recognize and understand that just knowing what's going on, just knowing the systems that were collapsing, knowing about information and things that have been hidden from us, these kind of what people used to call conspiracy theory information, right?  All of these things that are starting to boil up to the surface for us to read about and learn about, It's no longer going to be enough for us to just know about it.  They were showing me tonight that humans are going to have to start to take action.  that they're gonna have to start to uprise there's going to be an uprising and it's totally okay and normal.  they were saying like it's not a bad thing it's not about a civil war or civil upset or unrest or violence or any of that.  They were saying that there is literally a leveling up of the light worker and the warrior of light that we, in order for us to continue moving into these higher states of consciousness and literally dismantling the consciousnesses that are not only trying to keep us in these lower states, but the consciousnesses that can't come along into the higher states, meaning they're not shifting with us.  They're being dismantled or collapsed.  We have to start to level up against them.  So this is, they were telling me, this is a small group of humans that we would call the Illuminati or the New World Order or the Cabal, right?  They're all the same thing.  It doesn't matter the name you use.  It's a very small group of humans.  that have for a very long time, for thousands of years, but now in the most recent 100 years, 200 years, right?  But in the most recent 100 years, we call them the Cabal, the Illuminati, the New World Order.  Small group of humans that have been controlling the large human collective.  And they've been controlling the large human collective with consciousnesses such as fear, manipulation, control, and greed.  four main consciousnesses, which means they use those consciousnesses to control us.  And what's happened in 2020 is a lot of us have started to become aware of this.  And so we've been educating ourselves.  We've been learning things.  Some of us have been speaking up about it, right?  But the majority of us have been learning about it.  We've been tiptoeing into it.  Does it make sense?  Does it not make sense?  Do I want to look at this?  Do I not want to look at this?  Et cetera, et cetera, right?  Free will.  But this is what they were saying.  What is coming down the pike?  And again, anything's possible and they didn't give me specifics, but what they did say was that humanity is going to have to stand up.  There has to be an uprising of humanity and that the human is going to have to start to take action.  They're going to have to start to speak up.  demand their sovereignty and their rights.  And humans are gonna be a little bit uncomfortable with, especially if you are in the spiritual community, because you may feel as if it doesn't feel right, or it's not your job, or it's not your role.  And again, there's always free will, right?  So you do what resonates with you.  But the only thing I can say is what they showed me was it is literally a next level up of light work.  And it's okay to step into this next level.  It's okay to see the dark.  It's okay to acknowledge it.  It's okay to speak about it.  It is okay to stand up against it.  It's okay to say no.  Because when you hold the bigger perspective, which is this neutral perspective that all is perfect and divine, and that these small groups of humans that have been controlling humanity, they're just doing what they chose to do.  And based on the way that the human is evolving into higher states of consciousness, this is the consciousness that humanity is dissolving.  And so it's dismantling it, the fear, the greed, the manipulation and the control, it's being dismantled.  So from this higher perspective, there's nothing wrong with any of this.  This is just the way ascension works, the way that the evolution of consciousness works.  Now from this microscopic perspective, which is the human, the you human walking around, there's going to be a polarity around it, right?  Like a right, wrong, good, bad, perhaps.  That's evil, that's dark, that's not good, that's not okay, I'm standing up for my rights, I'm saying no, I'm choosing no, I'm choosing yes, whatever that is.  So we have to play in both of these perspectives, and both perspectives exist in the quantum field.  There's nothing wrong with standing and saying no.  I'm going to stand up and say no to this.  There's nothing wrong with saying that's not okay, right?  I don't agree with that.  There's nothing wrong with that.  So the light worker that is starting to up-level or rise up is going to be faced with this in the next year.  Many of you that are kind of tiptoeing around that really dark stuff.  It's okay to see it.  It's okay to acknowledge it.  It's okay to stand up against it.  It's okay to stay neutral.  But what they showed me tonight was that many, many of us that have been sort of standing back behind the scene, behind the gate, sort of just watching to see what's gonna unravel, not really wanting to go in, not really wanting to touch that evil and that dark, we're gonna touch that evil and that dark.  We're gonna stand up to it.  And we're gonna stand up to it in a way that we never thought we would have to, and that we never thought we would.  It's a whole new quote unquote game that we're stepping into right now for many lightworkers, for many of us in the spiritual community.  My guide specifically said lightworkers.  Lightworkers are gonna be uprising, leveling up, meaning those of us that have shied away from looking at the evil, shied away from looking at the dark, shied away from playing in it.  Because playing in this doesn't mean that you are participating in it and that you're perpetuating it.  Playing in it means you're standing on the field with it, you're acknowledging it and you're courageously saying, no more.  no more.  and the way we say no more to a consciousness that we have to dismantle, which means we have to see it, we have to stand up to it.  We have to speak our truth.  We have to stand in our sovereignty and in our strength.  And we do this from love, from compassion, from empathy, from understanding that this is literally game.  this is an illusion of in physicality because we're not physical we're energy we're not physical we're energy.  so this is all an illusion even though it's real and we all chose to be down here at this time to break free of the illusion and to pull the human collective up into these higher states of consciousness playing in a physical realm.  So you're here to play in this.  You're here to stand in the physical.  You're here to look at the dark and the evil.  You're here to say, let's go.  This is why I'm here.  This is why I came down.  Not to pretend it's not there.  Not to turn my back.  Not to say that I'm not a good lightworker if I charge forward with my armor and stand up to them, right?  Ignoring it.  Many of us are not going to be able to ignore it anymore, right?  And these things that are going to be shown to us have already started to be shown to us, right?  It's the systems that have been in place for a very long time that are being taken down, right?  And it has everything to do with the financial system.  It has everything to do with the political system.  It has everything to do with... many systems right.  sex trafficking is a big one.  the pedophilia rings are a big one.  so there's all these systems that we're going to start to look at and see the corruption behind it how there's a small group of people that have been controlling humanity for a very long time.  big deal.  so what bring it on?  this is the way we go through the shift in human consciousness.  It's not a big deal, right?  If you see it as just the game, as just the illusion, and it's gonna maybe hurt, maybe be uncomfortable, maybe make us nauseous, maybe make us angry, maybe make us rageful, whatever that is.  But if we see it as what it is, the role we came down here to play, to look it in the face and say, let's go, I'm ready, knowing that we have hundreds of thousands of lightworkers ready to charge forward, It's not this like big elephant in the room that we don't want to talk about.  But instead it's like, oh, this is the next level of this game that we're playing.  We're now on level three, right?  Let's go.  I'm ready.  What do we have to do for this level?  Oh, we got to look this crap in the face.  Oh, we got to stand up to it.  Oh, we have to be courageous and say no or say yes.  Oh, we have to stand up for our truth.  We have to start speaking our truth more and more.  We have to make challenging and difficult decisions.  Oh.  i have to be more active i have to participate a little bit more.  got it okay.  so what when we don't take it so seriously when we don't make it like a right or wrong a good or bad but instead just this large perspective of small systems being dismantled that seem like big but they're small systems.  in the large scheme of the human collective.  they're small.  there's many more of us than there are of the small small elite cabal.  new world order right whatever you want to call them illuminati doesn't matter the name they're a group of humans and this group of humans they've all.  they've been around for thousands of years And now is the now moment that we get to collapse it, that we get to pull humanity into heaven on earth right now.  And the only way we stand in heaven on earth is we get rid of the systems that are shrouded in evil, that are shrouded in fear, that are shrouded in corruption and greed and control.  No other way of doing it.  Just like there's no other way of you moving into higher states of consciousness without looking at the trauma and the shadow.  So we have to see it.  We have to pull it apart.  And many of you are going to be asked to play very different roles as we move forward into 2021.  So don't make it wrong.  Don't make it right.  Just remember that this is why you're here.  Do it with an open heart, with compassion and love, almost with like a spunk, like let's go.  We've got this.  I'm so excited, even though this is crazy.  I can't believe this chaos.  I can't believe this nonsense.  I can't believe what they've been getting away with.  and let's go.  So instead of anger and rage and resentment and fear, right?  And wanting to beat them, uh-uh.  We're shining our light.  We're standing strong.  We're standing firm.  We're standing in love, compassion, and empathy.  We're understanding the larger perspective.  We remember that we're here for this and we charge forward arm in arm, hand in hand saying, I'm ready to level up.  I'm ready to uprise.  I'm ready to do this.  So I don't know what this looks like.  All I know is that's the message I got tonight.  I'm excited to do this with you guys.  There is no right or wrong.  There is no right way to do it.  There's no wrong way to do it.  We all have free will, but many of us in 2021 are going to rise up.  And I'm so excited to rise up with you.  I love you so much.  Thanks for being here. ",
