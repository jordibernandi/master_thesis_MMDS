In Vanity Fair's latest issue, special correspondent Maureen Orth unearths claims of what she calls a top secret process of finding a girlfriend for Tom Cruise, headed by the wife of Scientology chief David Miscavige.  Scientology spokespeople deny any such project.  But according to Vanity Fair, the organization was seeking and auditioning actresses, strictly Scientologists, for a real-life role as a girlfriend for Tom Cruise.  They were allegedly told they were auditioning for a training film, and then asked questions including, what do you think of Tom Cruise? ",

And that in a month-long preparation was told to lose her braces, her red highlights, and her boyfriend, and even signed a confidentiality agreement.  The article goes even further, saying that when the pair first met in November of 2004, that's when Banyadi first sensed this was possibly going to be an arranged marriage.  And although they spent that first night together, they did not have sex.  According to Vanity Fair, Cruz told Bagnati, I've never felt this way before.  And eventually, his affection became overwhelming, with Cruz reportedly telling her, I get more love from an extra than from you.  The article adds that Bagnati moved into Cruz's home, even shared a bedroom, and was given a credit card issued in the name of Cruz's company, her only source of money.  The article says the relationship was over in January 2005, just three months before the star publicly dated Katie Holmes because Cruise wanted, quote, someone with her own power, like Nicole Kidman.  According to the article, Bignotti was then sent to a Scientology center where she allegedly broke down and revealed her relationship with Cruise to a friend, which violated her confidentiality agreement.  As punishment, Vanity Fair says her chores included scrubbing toilets with a toothbrush, cleaning tiles with acid, and digging ditches in the middle of the night.  The Church of Scientology, however, denies this, saying the church does not punish people, especially in that manner. ",
