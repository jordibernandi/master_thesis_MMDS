And the other thing I would say is, I'm more of a New Testament guy, so I actually prefer to look at Ephesians, where it says, slaves, obey your masters with respect and fear.  Ephesians was not written to Jews.  Ephesians was written to a church in Ephesus in the Roman Empire.  So it doesn't matter.  Across the board, the Bible does not condone slavery.  Jesus could have very easily just said, hey, don't own people.  and we'd have been way better off.  In fact, people talk about we couldn't write a better book than the Bible.  All you'd have to do is insert that one line, hey, don't own people, and all of a sudden the book would be better.  So in terms of you asked that initial question, I think the Bible is at least complicit in slavery.  And in the second thing about evolution and whether things can be owned, I mean... We shouldn't even have cats.  That's a whole different discussion.  But I think you're misunderstanding evolution as soon as you say highly evolved.  And maybe you want to check that out a bit more.

And some people are going to look at it as indentured servitude.  But the problem is, as I pointed out in my video about slavery, indentured servitude is also immoral.

And if that is the case, here's how that debt is paid off.  And if they violate the contract, here's the potential punishment.  And here's who's going to implement that.  But instead, it tells you how to trick your Hebrew slaves into being your slaves forever instead of just six years.  Because if a male Hebrew slave comes in, He has to be let go after six years.  But if you give him a wife, when his six years are up, her time is not up.  And so he can still leave, but he has to leave his wife and potential and any kids they had behind with you.  That's what it says in Exodus 21.  And if he comes in and says, no, no, no, I love my master and I want to stay here.  then you pierce his ear and he becomes your property forever.  So if you don't want to have to let your Hebrew slaves go after six years, you give them a wife.
