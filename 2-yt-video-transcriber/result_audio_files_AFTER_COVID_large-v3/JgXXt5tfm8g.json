He's running for the seat vacated by Katie Hill.  And as you guys know, his opponent, Hillary Clinton, I mean, Christy Smith.  uh has refused to show her face to any debate any conversation virtually anything.  in fact i didn't even hear her voice until recently when she put out her advertisement because that's how much of a ghost she is and how much of a coward she is.  she has all the establishment endorsements already and so she doesn't really need to do anything aside from that.  Now, there was a district congressional forum in California's 25th.  This was not a debate stage, and so they weren't really able to debate.  But what you're going to see here is I'm going to clip all this stuff up for you guys of Cenk Uygur.  Virtually every question that he answers, he goes after Christy Smith, and it's on one specific issue that he goes after Christy Smith on because they're all asked questions about different policy takes.  And he always rings it back to a really core issue.  And I'm guessing you probably know what that core issue is.  But I guess that's some trivia for you folks.  Go ahead and check it out. ",

            "text": "Hi, I'm Cenk Uygur.  And there are huge differences between the candidates here.  And I'm really glad that Christy finally showed up so we could have that discussion.  So... My opponent says that she'd like to work with Republicans at all levels.  Donald Trump is at one of those levels.  I would love to ask her, what is she going to work with Donald Trump on?  I don't want to work with Donald Trump.  I want to defeat Donald Trump.  I started a show called The Young Turks.  We are proudly home of progressives, not home of moderates, not home of people who'd like to work with Republicans.  I founded Wolfpack.  That is to get money out of politics.  I co-founded Justice Democrats that proudly got the four strongest women into Congress, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna Pressley, Rashida Tlaib, and Ilhan Omar.  And when I was co-founder of Justice Democrats, we invented something called a no-corporate PAC pledge, which I am glad that my opponent took a couple of weeks ago.  So, now, look, there's policy differences.  I am for Medicare for all.  That is universal health care.  It's the only thing that gets you universal health care.  No co-pays, no premiums, no deductibles.  Everything else says that you do not have health care as a right.  I'm for the Green New Deal to create high-paying solar and wind energy jobs in this district.  My opponent, on the other hand, her average last year was $2,700 from AT&T, Facebook, UnitedHealth.  That is the largest insurance company in the world.  Are you going to give that back?  And are you against Medicare for All because you mean it?  Or are you against Medicare for All because UnitedHealth gave you money?  She says she's not taking money now.  She says she's not taking money now, but she's taking money from Goldman Sachs, BP, Wells Fargo, Sempra, and Coke Brothers.  Thank you.  Mr.  Mercury.  When the government was shut down and he had shut it down, his poll numbers were going down, and he had said on the record that he wanted to protect Dreamers.  That was the perfect time to extract that compromise from him.  But Democratic leadership didn't do it.  they'd let them off the hook.  If I'm in the House, I'm never, ever going to let them off the hook.  And I'm going to tell them, the reason you fight is not to vent, guys.  The reason you fight is because it's more practical.  When you have that moment of leverage, you must use it.  On the other hand, Christie, for example, voted to deny undocumented immigrants Medi-Cal.  Why did you do that?  My God, that feeds into a Republican stereotype, by the way.  Undocumented immigrants put more money into the system through the payroll tax that they never get back.  They don't get the money back from Social Security and Medicare that they pay into. ",

First of all, defend and shore up the ACA.  Secondarily, create a public option that can be purchased by individuals on the Obamacare exchange along with a group plan option available to small businesses.  To Courtney's point, there are lots of small businesses who would love to be able to provide health care for their employees but haven't been able to.  To Mr.  Lozano's point, we need to create consumer protections in the system.  Healthcare market is the one industry where consumers have very little protection and very little opportunity to have clear pricing indicators within that market.  And then additionally, we need a substantial waiver program for Medicaid.  dollars that come from the federal government and allow states to be innovative subsidize and we will subsidize for everyone who can't afford a plan on their own.  but we have to act with immediate immediacy.  this crisis is urgent and that means we have to take the best path to get us there quickly and that's adding a public option to what currently exists.

I didn't take money from Jeff Dunham PAC, which is a Republican PAC.  So no, I didn't do any of that.  But yes, 20 years ago, I used to be a Republican.  And so the last Republican I ever voted for was John McCain in the primary against George W. Bush.  tax plan was an absolute disaster.  it put a 1.9 trillion dollar hole in our deficit and I'd like to ask him how are you gonna pay for that?  so the top 1% got 83% of those tax cuts.  And by the way, here in District 25, that was not a tax cut.  For a lot of homeowners, that was a tax increase.  And in this case, the person who did that is Steve Knight.  He voted for that, and he robbed us of our money and gave it to the richest people in the country.  And when you talk about the deficits that are created by Republicans, and it is almost always Republicans that create deficits, Look at the $6.4 trillion that the Iraq war and the Afghanistan war cost us.  How are you going to pay for that?  And Christy, no, I'm kidding.  I'm kidding.  I'm kidding.  This one's totally a Republican fault.  100% Steve Knight and Republicans. ",

            "text": "yeah so that was honestly.  it was so bad that I literally felt pity for Christy Smith.  I mean that's how bad that was because she just seems so defeated especially if you watch the video in which other people are talking and it's not her but it's panned on her group.  she just looks like really down and really defeated and really in the dumps.  and as you saw uh from what I went through unless I'm missing something which I would be very shocked by if I missed something It doesn't look like she ever addressed him at any point whatsoever, literally not even once.  And so the only thing I even put in of her there was her comment about Medicare for All because it was crucial, you know, in terms of the back and forth, as well as her opinion on Medicare for All is absolutely hilarious.  Cenk is trying to point out how we're in basically, you know, a crisis and a moral emergency.  And then Christy agrees, but she's like, the best way is a public option, which... That's a horrible way, by the way.  Public option is completely riddled with failure written on it, especially when she's not even saying that it's a free option for certain people.  She seems to be saying it's only a buy-in, which is like, that's even worse.  You're not even making it free for certain people.  I mean, that's embarrassing, right?  And so her answer on that is ridiculous.  But as you saw there, Cenk's strategy was basically, I'm going to hit home on the main crux of an issue.  The two most important issues for people... um, are corruption and healthcare.  Okay, now healthcare is number one according to the polls, but I think corruption is also a really big one for them.  Big reason why Donald Trump won the election in 2016.  And so he decided, you know what I'm going to do?  I'm going to reroute all of my answers about these policy questions.  to money and politics showing how all of these people are basically sellouts obviously and then pointing out christy smith and how he she's a sellout right and so uh he keeps doing that over and over.  it's so hilarious that people start laughing at this like the amount of just how like that's how bad he was pummeling her and she couldn't even respond.  that's how weak she was.  so She had no response.  She had no, like, you know, comebacks or anything, and so it was so embarrassing.  He keeps hammering home that, and you literally see people laughing, like, laughing at him bringing up Christy Smith being a sellout so much, and it's just... I think it's a really good strategy, man, especially focusing on... Healthcare, healthcare is such a crucial issue because it's a moral emergency, right?  People are dying because of it, 68K to be exact.  And so, you know, when you've got damn near 70,000 a year dropping because they don't have health insurance.  And you've got this incredibly distorted system.  And by the way, Christie's answer is totally wrong, dead wrong.  A public option is not the best way to solve it.  In fact, it really won't solve anything.  A public option, that is, won't solve anything in reality.  But she's totally wrong, obviously.  And so hopefully they'll have a debate at some point.  I really hope so.  They better have a debate at some point.  I believe their election is on Super Tuesday, if I'm not mistaken.  So I'm not sure.  I'm going to have to see about that 100%.  But, you know, Christy Smith has been a coward up until this point.  She's refused to even show up.  But even here she's being a coward because she refuses to even respond to anything or even do any sort of comeback.  And so this is a forum.  I get it's not like a direct debate, but... We definitely need some debates to happen between these folks because otherwise it's not a real election if you're not having any actual debates.  And I think that the moderators even had to tell people to stop booing Christy Smith.  I'm surprised she didn't get booed more considering that she's such a sellout and I don't see how anybody could be interested in Christy Smith's campaign whatsoever.  But it was definitely very juicy to see Christy Smith getting pummeled there and just not being able to respond and just looking so defeated.  so so defeated and just so down in the dumps.  but uh jank once again doing a good job.  hopefully he will get the opportunity to do this more.  hopefully christy smith will stop being such a scaredy cat.
