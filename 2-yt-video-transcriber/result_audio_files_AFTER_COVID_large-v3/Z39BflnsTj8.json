Mr.  Santelli today gasped on the trading floor as the dollar hemorrhaged against the euro as the Fed came in with its most dramatic pump priming probably since, I don't know when, the middle 1930s.  Peter, I want to go to you, Peter Schiff.  You used to have a saying in the trading room of the big firm I used to work for.  I might add that firm is no longer in business.  This was many years ago.  I used to call it palm trees growing on the trading floor as the Fed was pumping out large quantities.  quantities of money.  And, Peter, I want you to respond to this, because I want to ask Wayne Angel, and I want to ask Bob McTeer, when the last time they went to Argentina, because that subject interests me a lot.  Meanwhile, on the full screen, we're going to put the Fed's balance sheet, reserve bank credit, we're going to put the monetary base, and we're going to put M1, just to let people see the degree to which we have expanded the money side.  Just throw it up there.  Reserve bank credit is over 100%.  Monetary basis, I think, even on a smooth basis, about 45%.  And M1 and M2 are both growing about 8%.  Peter Schiff, where is this going to lead?  Where?  Are we going to get economic recovery?  Are people going to buy mortgages?  What? ",

They're a wealthy creditor nation.  They have a high savings rate.  They had a trade surplus.  We're going to follow in the footsteps of Argentina.  So if you want to look at America's future, go look at Argentina's past.  This is what is going to happen.  All we're doing is creating money.  Asset bubbles have burst.  Real estate prices have to fall.  Companies have to fail.  This phony service sector economy has to be allowed to unwind.  We have to let the free market function.  If the government simply tries to manufacture savings out of thin air and get people to go deeper into debt to buy more products that we can't afford, they're going to destroy our currency. ",

There are several programs the Federal Reserve has put in place that basically unwind themselves, and they offer interest rates that are not competitive in a more normal market, but they are competitive and actually advantageous in this very frozen-up market.  Let me give you another example of the TARP here.  The TARP money is a dividend of 5% for five years.  that goes to 9% after the fifth year.  So there is an incentive there for a bank to come forward and take out the government in the fifth year.  There are several programs here that have embedded exit strategies. ",
