As we go to Indiana, where authorities are investigating a violent, racist attack on an African-American man that took place over July 4th weekend, it was caught on film.  But more than a week later, no arrests have been made in response to the incident.  A warning to our viewers, this story contains disturbing images.  Vox Booker was at Lake Monroe, near Bloomington, Indiana, in the Indiana State Forest, with friends on July 4th, when five white men pinned him to a tree, beat him, threatened to lynch him.  Booker is a member of the Monroe County Human Rights Commission in Bloomington.  He says he was able to get out of the mob's hands after passersby intervened to get the attackers off him.  Last week, Box held a news conference with his attorney, local elected officials and two of the white witnesses.  who intervened on his behalf during the attempted lynching.  This is a reporter questioning one of those witnesses, Stephen Cox. ",

When they called him, you can leave the boy here.  You guys can go, but you can leave the boy here.  So the white people could go, but they wanted us to leave him there and to do what they wanted to with him.  I don't think anybody could do that in good conscience.
