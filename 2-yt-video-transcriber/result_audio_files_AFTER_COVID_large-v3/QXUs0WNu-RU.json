            "text": "All right.  Thank you.  So, uh, as I just mentioned, with the Canaanite issue.  If there's no God, why would any Old Testament atrocity be wrong?  But Cody is correct about this.  He has a fair point to ask me, despite the fact that he being an atheist has no objective standard by which to judge anything right or wrong.  He is correct to ask me, you're saying your God is a God of love, so why does he do such things?  So that's a fair question, okay?  All right.  Secondly, though, is God arbitrary or does he give reasons in the Old Testament for judging people?  Because that's what it is in the Old Testament.  It's judging.  God is not a cosmic mafia boss.  He doesn't wake up one day and say, Canaanites, I want them dead.  No, there's a reason that he has decided to push the Canaanites out of the land.  And it's because they've had 400 years of iniquity, including death.  murdering their children, sacrificing their children on the molten hot metal.  god, Molech.  And it wasn't just the Old Testament that talks about this.  The Greek writer Plutarch says that when the Canaanites would do this, the drummers in the town would pound their drums louder so the children or the parents couldn't hear the screams of their own children being sacrificed.  Also, I hear this quite a bit.  Why complain that God doesn't stop evil, but then complain when he does?  In other words, sometimes atheists will say, why didn't God stop such and such a tragedy?  Yet here, God sees that this culture is so degraded that he finally says, these people must be stopped.  And he sends the Israelites in to stop them.  And now atheists are complaining about it.  And the question I always ask people is God committing murder by ending lives on earth?  and the answer is no.  God doesn't murder anyone.  He can't murder you on.  he is the creator of life.  He can resurrect it.  only people who are other creations can commit murder.  When God ends somebody's life, it's not murder.  And as I mentioned a minute ago, God has the right to usher people into the next life whenever he wants, whether we're 82 or two years old, that's up to him.  People never die, they just change location.  And we also need to remember that the Old Testament theocracy was unique and temporary.  It was not the ideal for all time, but the means to a promised new covenant.  And the best book on this topic is by Paul Copan, Is God a Moral Monster?  And Cody's actually bringing up good questions that Christians need to deal with.  And Copan goes through all of those issues.  One is the Canaanites, another slavery, these kinds of issues.  And you can get that book if you want to go further.  But this is not genocide.  It's actually judgment.  Why?  How do I know?  Because God did the same thing to Israel.  God took out the Israelites through the Babylonians and the Assyrians.  And he also took out the Israelites after they worshiped the golden calf.  It was judgment, not genocide. ",
