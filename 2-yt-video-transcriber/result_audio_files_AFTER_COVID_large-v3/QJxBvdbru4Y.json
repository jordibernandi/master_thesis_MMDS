            "text": "Two of the last five presidential elections produced an unusual outcome.  The winners of the nationwide popular vote didn't become president because they didn't win the Electoral College.  As a result, many people believe we should abolish the Electoral College and elect the president by a simple national majority.  But the Electoral College serves a number of important purposes.  The Electoral College requires candidates to broaden their national appeal.  Most states allocate all their Electoral College votes to the candidate who wins the most votes in that state.  So barely winning a state is worth just as much as winning it by a landslide.  This means candidates have an incentive to win as many states as possible and not just run up the totals in states that already lean to their party.  Without the Electoral College, they would likely choose more extreme policy positions to further appeal to their base, rather than try to win over moderate and independent voters.  Each party already tends to represent the interests of particular states instead of the whole country.  Removing the Electoral College would increase this favoritism and increase the polarization that already exists.  A direct national vote would also mean that instead of recounts happening at the state level, each and every vote could be challenged and recounted equally.  Imagine the chaos of national recounts with legal challenges all over the country, with each candidate suing in districts with judges friendly to their party.  Ultimately, if we want to prevent partisanship and political polarization from becoming even worse than it already is, it's critical to preserve the Electoral College. ",
