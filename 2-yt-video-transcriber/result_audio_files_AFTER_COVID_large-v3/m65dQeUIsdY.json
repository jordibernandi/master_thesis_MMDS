            "text": "Hey, yo, what it do, my Melanated Ones?  Y'all know who it is, Drop Don.  Hey, yo, family, check it out.  Drop wasn't even going to do no video today.  I was going to be like, yo, man, I'm going to let YouTube rock.  I'm not even going to check no emails.  I'm not even going to be on YouTube.  I said I was going to leave it alone for the day.  But lo and behold, I ended up on YouTube reading emails, and it led me here.  I mean, so I do want to address a couple of things since I got y'all here, man.  I mean, black people, have we?  I mean, and then this goes out to the people that hate on Jay so much because I see, man, his videos coming up.  And this is crazy.  Y'all people do more hate you now since this dude can't even respond back to the idea when he was active.  What was all this?  What was all this energy when this man could have responded to popped up on your ass?  What was you?  Where was all these YouTube videos that did?  I mean, this shit is insane.  Every every time I stroll, it's a whole new channel.  Making videos all on this dude trying to badmouth his name and all kinds of shit.  Yo, y'all people is ridiculous.  It's kind of to the point.  YouTube is kind of a turn off, yo.  I mean, damn it.  Then it's only like, I mean, come on, people.  It ain't like Jay did.  None of y'all motherfuckers personally.  Y'all feel like y'all got to have a whole people is going on live, staying on live a whole hour and a half, two hours talking about Jay.  Who the hell stays on live two hours talking about Jay?  When this man can't even respond to nothing y'all saying right now.  That's cowardly to me, man.  That's cowardly ass moves.  And then the stupid part about it, I could understand the white people.  I mean, I ain't going to say I understand it, but it makes more sense for they great.  But for black people, I mean, at the end of the day, you, okay, if you don't agree, leave it like that.  Why try to tarnish this man name, yo?  See, that's what I'm saying.  A lot of people, man, that's why a lot of y'all be getting hit in the eye.  A lot of y'all be getting smacked in the mouth over shit like that because it's insane.  I feel like, damn, man, around this time, we can't find nothing that's better to do.  This man already going through enough.  And then y'all people, then y'all see how the news do it.  It's news stations that's reporting on this guy now, man, that didn't even want to bring him up when he was out here active.  That's my whole thing.  People wait.  This is my thing, man.  It ain't just for black people, man.  But the news people too, man, they wait for your downfall.  They ain't going to promote you while you up and you shining and you doing good.  Ain't none of these news people really want to cover Jay when he was out here, when he was out here doing his thing.  By the time he get locked up, every damn news station available is reporting him.  The same people that didn't want to cover him when he was out here active is the same people that's reporting this story when he get locked up.  And that's crazy.  I mean, that's what I'm saying.  It's only like they only promote the fucked up shit when it comes to black people, yo.  They only want to promote it when you fucking up.  Whole time Jay was out here trying to stand for something, half these news channels was shutting this man down.  They didn't even want him on the show.  But now guess who face they got?  And that shit is crazy to me.  That shit is crazy to me.  Let that man live, yo.  Damn, man, this man can't even live.  He can't.  He couldn't live trying to do the right thing.  You sit in the jail.  Then you're going to crucify him when he come home.  He ain't even active no more.  Y'all still out here making these videos.  Y'all still out here making these videos.  I mean, come on.  What do you expect this man to do now?  He can't get on YouTube.  He can't get on IG.  He can't leave America.  He can't have no guns.  And y'all still want to bad mouth this man.  I hope he run across a couple of y'all and punch y'all in the mouth.  honestly but at the end of the day that's why y'all don't show faces and all that you hide behind screens and all that and then you want to thug type on.  i mean it'd be weird to me man.  a lot of y'all people is weird i had.  i did not understand youtube.  i understood it but i didn't understand it the way i understand it.  now until i start uploading these j videos.  man yo that hate amongst black people is real.  i thought the hate umar johnson ain't even got no haters man.  I mean, the people talking about Omar Johnson got haters.  His haters, he got people that just don't like the fact that they feel like he's taking their money.  Grandmaster J got haters.  He got FBI haters.  I mean, it's a whole different.  And then people wake up.  I got this one dude, and I'm not even going to say your name, Scoob, because I'm pretty sure you watch this video because you always thumb down.  I'm pretty sure you're the one thumb down it.  Because, Scoob, you wake up every morning.  First, you think about J., then you think about me because i'm pretty sure ain't nobody up five or six o'clock in the morning worrying about another man dropping youtube videos but you but i ain't going i ain't gonna shout your name out.  yo i mean at the end of the day man if i have a good money i'll send your lady some flowers because obviously you're not doing it at home school.  i don't want to send your lady flowers but at the end of the day you boring because you're coming.  yo i mean come on man.  Not unless you're on the other side of the track and you use the track to demand, because why do you feel like you have to show me so much attention?  because you're scared to shoot these emails at Jay?  I mean, not unless you do.  I don't know.  But people like you are not going to shoot him emails.  You're going to shoot people like me emails.  I mean, so either you borderline on that side of the track, man, or you like men, or you just infatuated with dumb shit.  I mean, to me, man, it don't bother me.  I will address you, but it don't bother me, man.  You live all the way, no telling where.  But you do what you do.  You always got your little fake profile pics up and all that.  You always typing weird-ass shit.  I be seeing you in the comment sections and then bright and early in the morning, you want to hit me with emails.  Hey, man, it don't bother me.  Like I said, it all ends up being a view to me, school.  That's all it is.  It's a view to me on YouTube, man.  And your little emails, sometimes I read them, sometimes I don't.  Like I said, some mornings, man, they be kind of cute to me.  I mean, some motherfuckers don't even get a good morning from nobody, motherfucker.  I get an email from you every morning.  Kudos to you and your every morning emails, bro.  Like I said, man, I will send your wife some flowers eventually, yo.  Because you say you's a married man and all that.  I mean, evidently, I mean, you need to tighten up on some things if you want to spend most of your day emailing me.  But that's cute.  But that wasn't the reason why I did this video to talk about that clown, man.  That clown going to be a clown.  I let clowns be clowns.  I just wanted to address the situation.  what's going on out here with J-Name.  Y'all leave J-Name alone, yo.  I'm not that dude's bodyguard.  I'm not that dude's spokesperson.  But what's right is right.  Right now, he cannot defend himself.  So keep your name out his mouth.  Well, y'all keep his name out your mouth.  I mean, if it's not going to be nothing good to try to better that man, Now, unless y'all hitting $10, $15 in that cash app trying to better that man and trying to get him a better lawyer and a better defense, just chill a little bit, yo.  At the end of the day, I don't care about no smoke.  You know what I mean?  You want to talk shit about people, talk shit about people.  But at the end of the day, I do feel it's the right and the wrong time to talk shit.  That man can't defend himself.  He can't say nothing right now.  He can't make videos to reply to y'all dumbasses.  So, I mean, at the end of the day, it's a handicap match.  Leave it alone.  Leave it alone.  I mean, if you're going to play, play fair, yo.  Wait until this dude come up out of this situation where he can address some of y'all.  clown ass niggas, man.  And then at the end of the day, you play fair.  This is not a fair game.  y'all playing.  You understand what I'm saying?  I know the news is not going to play fair.  They have never played fair because they work for them.  But to y'all local jokers that's on the street trying to mess this man name up, y'all leave it alone.  Find something else better to do, man.  There's a bunch of shit trending more than J-Name.  If you're not going to say nothing good, don't say nothing wrong, man.  And it's drop.  I love y'all, family.  I'll holler at y'all tomorrow. ",
