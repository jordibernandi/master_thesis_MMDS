            "text": "Honestly, I live within driving distance of Little Miss Blair.  I could take her out from a distance.  It would be my pleasure to erase this trash from Earth.  People are gonna be mad about this one.  Hey guys, welcome back to my channel.  So today's video is on a topic that I have never done a deep dive into.  I've never done a dedicated video on this topic.  And this is such a schism, war really within the trans community, this topic of do you need gender dysphoria to be transgender?  Is gender dysphoria a prerequisite to being a transgender person?  Now, despite never going into depth about my opinions on this topic I get a lot of hate comments about it and what people perceive my stance to be which I have briefly discussed but never in depth.  so today we're gonna react to some videos of some trans people who feel very strongly that you do not need dysphoria to be trans as well as going over a very insane death threat.  I got over the situation.  But very briefly, I just wanted to state that all throughout the month of May, you guys know I've been doing a couple cash app and PayPal giveaways on my YouTube.  One video, a few videos ago I did, and on my Instagram a lot.  So I decided all the way through the month of May, on every picture or video I post on my Instagram feed, it will have a cash giveaway attached to it just to help out people during this time.  We've been doing... lot of that on Instagram lately and it's very fulfilling personally.  so I want to keep it going.  so if you're interested in that definitely follow me on Instagram or if you just want to follow for whatever reason that's cool too.  so yeah be on the lookout for that.  so before you go any farther I feel like it's definitely important to define gender dysphoria because that is a focal point of this video.  so gender dysphoria is defined as the condition of feeling one's emotional and psychological identity as male or female to be opposite of one's biological sex.  very simple.  it is in layman's terms the distressing feeling that i had going all through my childhood of being identified by people around me and people who knew me as male.  it was very distressing.  i know it's hard to understand if you're not trans but that was what made me want to transition.  that was the mechanism that made me feel like hey maybe i should just live as a girl that might be more comfortable for me.  That was it.  Now, I experienced that as young as four or five, preschool, so I personally feel it definitely has something to do with some sort of neurological misalignment in my brain.  That's my personal feelings about it.  And there have been a lot of brain scan studies on transgender people, which do show that male to female transsexuals do have very similar brain anatomy to biological women, and that's a lot to get into, but... yeah.  but with the definition of transgender being ever expanding and the rise of what we call trans trenders, right?  people who appropriate being trans for attention, um you can act like they don't exist.  they do.  they're obviously not as common as actual trans people but they definitely exist and to deny it is to be in denial.  so what i tried to wrap my head around is why anyone would identify as trans without having gender dysphoria.  like What would make you want to transition?  I know some people don't even transition.  It's just like an identity.  It's trans.  But what would be the mechanism?  What would be the thing that causes you to feel a certain way?  It has to be gender dysphoria.  I can't imagine anything else.  I mean, unless you want to start getting into talks of my soul is female and whatever.  But I personally don't believe in souls.  That's just not where my head has ever been at.  So I'm not going to go... that route.  so i personally feel that the existence of gender dysphoria validates trans people on a scientific level and gives other people the opportunity to see that it's not really a choice that we feel or behave this way.  similar to how society coming around to the idea that gay people don't choose to be gay helped them.  i mean they're gay.  they didn't choose it.  that's just what it is.  regardless of how your beliefs are, a lot of gay people just don't choose it.  So because of this, I get called a transmedicalist, which in the trans community is supposed to be a bad word and basically just means bigot.  I cannot begin to understand why that makes me a bigot, the idea that we are validated by science.  But of course, the idea that there is scientific validity to being transgender completely destroys the argument of self-identification, which is just... the people they're doing it for attention like they don't have dysphoria so they want to be included without having to have it which is very debilitating by the way and it's a bit of an insult to people who do experience dysphoria to just be told that like that's not a prerequisite to being trans.  i'm sorry.  every trans person i've ever talked to has experienced it to some level and the plight is real.  it's real.  so let's take a look at some of these people today.  this person left a comment on a facebook post someone made about me and i actually ended up having to go to the police with these person's comments and reporting them and you'll see why.  in a second this person says i'm sick of him talking about me.  cute invalidating trans identified folk who are open about never experiencing dysphoria.  he is transfer true scum la trash.  i don't know what transfer means.  i know true scum is what they call people who believe in gender dysphoria.  um so interesting that you see yourself as fighting for trans people while calling me he and him.  um that's trashy.  So this person went on to say, honestly, I live within driving distance of little Miss Blair.  Like her, I own implements and know how to use them.  I could take her out from a distance.  It would be my pleasure to erase this trash from Earth.  Imagine being this disgusting.  Someone replies, so you're threatening to kill her?  She replies and says, I didn't say that at all.  Just saying I could pay Blur a visit, have a talk with her face to face.  Implements could be pens, paper, a phone, chocolate milkshakes.  Use your imagination.  So clearly that person is threatening my life and I went to the police about it.  And, you know, you can see the misery in their face for sure and why they would be that hateful and disgusting.  But let's focus on what you said about dysphoria versus not having dysphoria.  So for people who believe that you don't need gender dysphoria to be transgender, you need to explain to me what else would make you want to transition.  What other possible thing or purpose could there be to transitioning?  Because I can think of a few things.  I know people get attention when they transition.  I wouldn't like to believe people do that, but I know some people do.  And I'm sorry, but that is quite insulting and definitely feels like the appropriation of something that many people struggle with to the point where a lot of them think of really harming themselves and actually do it.  I've never personally been at that point, but I have been at a very low point.  I remember when I first started my channel, you guys know I didn't have, you know, my transitional surgeries at the beginning of my channel.  I did it in about 2017, which was like a year into my channel.  Before that, my life was miserable.  I was too uncomfortable to even go to the grocery store.  to leave my house, to even be seen by my boyfriend at the time.  in the house without makeup.  and transitioning and alleviating that dysphoria immensely helped me.  it cured a lot of my dysphoria, about 99% of it.  and just knowing how miserable it is to suffer with gender dysphoria, it's quite insulting that people would pretend as if that's not part of the trans experience.  and for anyone who claims to be trans but that doesn't experience that, you're not lesser than me.  i'm not like a badder bitch or cooler or more valid because i experience it.  you're valid in your own right, but I wouldn't say that you're trans.  I'm sorry.  And I'm sorry, but when you get rid of the medical criteria that there is to be transgender and to be diagnosed and set on a path of transition, which as of now is the only chance of alleviating and or curing dysphoria, when you get rid of the prerequisites for that, then you're expanding what trans is and you have kids being diagnosed as trans going and having life-altering surgeries and going on hormone replacement therapy that really maybe probably shouldn't end up regretting.  You know, we've interviewed detransmitters, we've talked about that before, so if anything, the belief that gender dysphoria is either not real or you don't need it to be trans is a lot more harmful to us than believing that you do have to have it, in my opinion.  So let's react to this video called Being Trans Without Having Dysphoria.  It's kind of like saying being depressed without being sad or being bald while still having hair, but okay, let's see. ",
