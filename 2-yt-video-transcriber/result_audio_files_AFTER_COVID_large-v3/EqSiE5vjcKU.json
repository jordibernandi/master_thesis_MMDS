He sent the comfort ship, the Javits Center, and he put tents in White Plains that were empty.  You never used any of them.  You sent elderly back to their nursing homes and murdered tens of thousands of grandmas and grandpas.  You banned hydroxychloroquine because President Trump gave us the right to try to use it.  With your executive order, you failed us.  You failed New York for years and you expect him to bail you out?  Well, New York is awoke and we're not staying quiet anymore. ",
