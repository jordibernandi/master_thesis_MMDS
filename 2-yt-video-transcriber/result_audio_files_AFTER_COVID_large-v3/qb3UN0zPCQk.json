Cities across the United States have started to rely on excessive fines and fees to fund their government operations, what the Institute for Justice calls taxation by citation.  Justice is warped when cities prioritize profit over public safety.  Today we're going to talk about the fight against taxation by citation in the town of Eagle, Wisconsin.  And here with me is IJ attorney, Kirby West.  Kirby, what's going on in Eagle? ",

            "text": "Well, as you said, Andrew, this is really a widespread phenomenon across the United States.  And what I think is the biggest problem in Eagle is what I think is the biggest problem in so many cities around the country.  And that's just that with their code enforcement, there are too many things you can get in trouble for.  And then when you get in trouble, you owe way too much money for the things that you did get in trouble for.  Unfortunately with Eagle, that's not the end of the story though.  Not only are there these really excessive fines and fees, but the way that the town is enforcing them is very problematic.  They're looking for specific people who might have spoken up against the town or the town board doesn't like for whatever reason and enforcing the ordinances specifically against those people first.  And then secondly, there's the influence of a private law firm that's a been contracted with by the town to enforce these code ordinances or these code violations.  And the problem with that isn't that a private actor is involved.  There are permissible ways to do that.  But the way that Eagle's done it has created a profit motive for enforcement.  And that means that this private law firm makes more money if they find more people who violated the code and they have found more violations for each person.  This kind of profit motive, as you can expect, leads to way over enforcement of the code and even more fines and fees for the residents of Eagle. ",

            "text": "Sure.  So the Victors bought their property about five years ago.  It's a 10-acre property in Eagle, and they bought it specifically because the prior owners had parked semi-trucks on the property.  Now, Joe Victor is a semi-truck driver, and he thought, this is perfect.  We can live here on this kind of idyllic rural property, and I can keep my trucks here for my business.  They even checked with the neighbors before they bought the property, saying, hey, we see that the current owners have trucks here.  Is that OK if we do the same thing?  The neighbor said that was fine.  No complaints.  So they bought the property, and they started doing that.  They had the trucks on the property.  Unfortunately, the neighbors changed their mind and decided they didn't like the Victor's having their trucks on their property.  They complained to the town and the town decided this violated the town ordinances of operating a commercial business on their private property here that was not zoned for it.  And they didn't just say, hey, stop, and you owe a small fine.  It led to this years-long ordeal for the victors.  They got a notice that they were in violation, and they tried to rectify it.  They put the trucks inside, which was what they were told to do, and they thought that would be the end of it.  Unfortunately, it wasn't.  The fines were racking up daily.  They didn't realize this, but the daily fines were just racking up over the course of months.  The town... scheduled a hearing but didn't properly notice the victors.  So the victors didn't know that they were supposed to appear in court over this violation.  So the court date came.  They didn't know about it, so they didn't show up.  And unfortunately, a default judgment was entered against them for almost $88,000 for a couple months of having trucks on their property.  This is just, as you can imagine, ruinous for the victors.  They don't have $88,000 lying around.  they can give to the town.  And they've been trying to work with the town ever since then to figure out a way that they could rectify this and go forward and maybe pay some kind of settlement.  The town has been just completely uncooperative.  They haven't been able to reach an agreement.  And now the victors just have this $88,000 judgment hanging over their head, preventing them from negotiating.  getting a loan to fix up their house or ultimately move out of Eagle to somewhere that's a little bit friendlier to live.  And, you know, it's just really been an ordeal for them over the past couple of years. ",

            "text": "Yeah.  So when the Victor's were going through this process and they were trying to settle, they were in talks with the town attorney who, again, works for this private law firm.  And they said, you know, what can we?  we want it?  We can pay something.  We realize that we've committed this ordinance violation.  We can pay something.  But can we work it out so that it's something we can actually afford?  And the Victor's had thought they reached an agreement for, you know, under ten thousand dollars that they could actually afford to pay.  And when they contacted the attorney and said, hey, this is our understanding that what do we do next to pay this settlement amount?  He said, oh, no, no, that's not a settlement I would have ever agreed to because it doesn't even cover my attorney's fees, which are $20,000.  So the attorney really does have an interest in getting them to pay this fines.  And you can see that from the draft default judgment that he gave to the judge to sign.  So in the draft order that the town attorney submitted to the judge to enter a default judgment against the victors, He actually included six months imprisonment in the town jail if they couldn't pay this almost $88,000 in fines and fees.  And so, as you said, you know, you really, I think, here can see the influence of that profit motive for the private actor here. ",

            "text": "So the Mallory's bought their farm because they were hoping to have this small family business that they could ultimately retire from their current jobs as a nurse and a cybersecurity specialist.  And so they have almost four acres, and they've really lovingly developed it into a farm where they have some livestock.  They have chicken coops where they sell eggs and poultry.  They grow vegetables that they were selling at a farm stand on their property.  And it's really just this labor of love for them that they're trying to develop this business.  And their troubles started a little while back when they advocated for neighbors who were trying to start a small business in Eagle.  And so their neighbors were, you know, not close by to the Mallory's, but neighbors within the town of Eagle were trying to start a small business that was a horse farm.  And they were getting a hard time from the town about starting this business.  So the Mallory's went to a town meeting and spoke up on behalf of their friends saying, you know, we think this would be a great thing for the town and a great thing for them.  How can we make this work?  They spoke up on social media as well, saying this is something that, you know, we think the town board is mishandling.  And after that, they started paying more attention to the town board generally.  They found that they weren't always following the processes and procedures for, for example, making town meeting minutes.  notes available to the public, little things like that.  So they started paying attention.  They came to more town meetings.  They spoke up more on social media about things they thought the town wasn't getting quite right.  And soon after they started becoming more active in the town, they found themselves also on the wrong end of the town code enforcement machine.  So they got a notice that they had.  there was an anonymous neighbor complaint about violations on their property.  Soon after, someone came out to inspect their property and they found out that they had just this laundry list of violations for things like.  Their grass was too high.  They had an unpermitted flower box.  They had, you know, slightly too many livestock because some of their animals had had babies.  They had too many beehives for their honey making operation.  They had, you know, equipment that was lying around.  Again, this is a farm, so they always have projects going on the farm.  And when somebody is walking by, yes, there might be some equipment or building materials, things that are... just part of normal farming operations.  They had buildings for their farming, like a greenhouse, that were unpermitted and they weren't allowed to have.  So they get this notice.  Their initial reaction is to try to comply.  They cut the grass.  They tear down some of the buildings.  They make arrangements to have some of their animals slaughtered so that they can get back down below the limit for livestock.  But this just wasn't enough for the town.  They go back and forth for months with more site visits, more violations, more notices.  Ultimately, they're being threatened with $20,000 in fines and fees for these violations that are really just part of operating a farm, which is what their family business is. ",

And this law firm, Silver and Wright, actually advertised to municipalities that Hey, we can make this worth your while because you won't owe us anything.  We'll recover directly from the people who are paying the fines and fees.  So to add insult to injury, you get prosecuted for violation of the town code, and then you also get the bill for that prosecution.  This is similar to that case in not that the direct mechanism is exactly the same, but that impermissible profit motive exists here.  And that really just poisons the whole system.  when you have a private actor, a third party that has a vested interest in trying to trying to get people and say, you know, find more violations and find higher fines, higher fees.

            "text": "Sure.  So as we mentioned, one of the biggest problems is just that the fines are too high, and there's just too many things that you can get in trouble for.  And this is unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment's Excessive Fines Clause.  So the Excessive Fines Clause guarantees that you cannot be charged fines that are just totally disproportionate to whatever the offense that you committed.  And here, In a case like the Victor's, for example, where the offense is having trucks on their property, almost $90,000 in fines is just excessive by any definition.  And similarly for the Mallory's of, you know, daily accumulating fines for things like having your grass too tall that lead to up to $20,000 in liability.  It's just too much.  And that's a violation, again, of the Eighth Amendment.  We also have this impermissible profit motive is actually unconstitutional.  It's unconstitutional to have a system of prosecution in which the prosecutors have a vested financial interest in the outcome.  That profit motive is unconstitutional under the 14th Amendment's due process clause.  And then finally \u2013 There are a couple other things, but another big way that this system is unconstitutional is in the Mallory's case, they were directly targeted because they were speaking out about what the town board was doing.  And obviously, if the First Amendment protects anything, it certainly protects your right to criticize the government.  That is just core First Amendment protected speech.  And in this case, we actually have pretty strong evidence that they were being targeted because of this core First Amendment speech.  We actually have an email from a member of the town board saying, you know, listen, I wanted to help you, but you just ticked off the board by your comments at the board meetings and your comments on Facebook, and they voted with emotion.  So we really kind of have what's unusual in this kind of First Amendment retaliation case, a smoking gun saying \u2013 you know, we admit that we are prosecuting you because you were speaking out against us.  And so that's just really a, you know, blatant violation of the First Amendment.  And that First Amendment retaliation claim is a big part of this lawsuit as well. ",
