            "text": "On June 7th of 2020, I attended another protest against police brutality.  This is not tied to the protests happening around the nation as a result of George Floyd's death.  This protest is done every month on the 7th in front of the Spokane County Courthouse from 12 to 1 p.m David's family and their friends are there every month at this time to raise awareness about their son and friend being shot in the back by order follower Brandon Rankin of the Spokane Police Department.  They invite everyone to join them, whether you're there for their son or some other victim of police brutality.  Towards the end of Novak's protest, order followers from a lot of local departments started showing up.  We even saw what looked like military police from the local Air Force base.  I took the heavy police presence towards the end of the Novak protest as a way to intimidate the peaceful protesters left and others starting to show up in the area for another round of protests tied to George Floyd's death.  As the first order follower shows up from the Spokane County Sheriff's Department in front of the courthouse with an Army MP in tow, I approach with others from the protest to see what's up and make sure there is no intimidation or restrictions on freedom.  And of course this order follower just can't help himself as I accurately predict.  Don't forget to upvote, share, subscribe and leave me a comment while you watch this tyrant display.  exactly why these thugs masquerading as heroes are a problem.  They think they can give free people not hurting anyone else or causing any problems directives on what to do simply because they have a badge and a gun issued by the ruling class.  David Novak was shot in the back and countless others killed or beaten for simply not following a directive like this.  Nothing else. ",

Oh, I'm sure.  guaranteed it's part of his job a few moments later.  uh i believe what the truth is what we see every day.  why does she have to leave there?  let's go guys crappy.  i'm tired of you guys terrorizing our communities.  what yeah have you ever heard of chad gordon?  What do you think about old Chad Gorton?  I know he doesn't work for us anymore.  Oh, that's good.  That's good.  At least you guys are getting rid of one of the bad, stinky bastards that works for you guys.  Yeah, the one that makes you guys look bad to others, even though you might not be.  You should be laying down your arms and joining the people.  No, I have a duty to do.  Yeah, I know.  Follow orders.  That's right.  Not saving innocent lives.  That's not what your job is, clearly.  I believe what the truth is, what we see every day.  Why does she have to leave there?  Well, then, sir.  Bring the fence down.  Sir, if she can't be there, then why did you put the fence there?  If you wanted her to stay here, this is the idiocy of what you guys do.  You put the line back there, and then you say, don't cross this imaginary line.  And then if she doesn't follow your orders, you're going to pull out your gun and make threats against her, probably.  That's what you guys do.  She wasn't hurting anything, and you started giving her commands.  That is not how a free country operates.  She wasn't hurting anything by being there.  How is that free?  How is it free for me to be free here?  Yeah.  Where does it say?  this is closed right here where my son and I can walk right here?  Where does it say it's closed?  So she was standing right there.  So now because you moved into that space, it's closed.  You can be on the sidewalk.  Where is that private property?  It's owned by the county, sir.  This is owned by the people.  It's a public campus.  It's a closed campus.  How is it closed?  It's closed because you guys closed it against our will to pay your bills.  Really?  What business are you going to do here today?  My business is coming here and letting you guys know that you are killing us.  I don't care.  I paid for it.  I didn't say you did, but you do not speak up when people wearing that uniform do.  Really?  Yes.  Okay.  You know who I am, do you?  I don't give a shit.  You said it when you got here that you are here to follow orders and you took away her rights.  So you don't care about freedom.  You're not an American.  You're an order follower because they told you to take away her rights and not let her stand right there.  That's why.  That's why we're pissed and that's why we're here.  Why do I have to get on the sidewalk?  What sign does it say that I have to not be on here?  Are you going to arrest me and my son for peacefully being here?  if I don't?  I am moving because you have weapons and you have threatened force against us, and I don't want my son to go to jail because you are uncomfortable.  You don't need anything.  You need to put your guns down and be with the people.  Yeah, and you need to, like, keep your ego in check, man.  You're not one of us.  Gorham, did you speak up when you knew Gordon hit his wife, or did you just let the department do it when it came out later?  A few moments later.  You see how the hero and the hero officer are doing that kind of stuff to people?  Have some balls. ",

You can read that there was no investigation.  They say George Floyd laid there for nine minutes.  David laid there and suffocated for 18 minutes.  You guys should be in a culture when you, I don't care if you're a police officer, you're a dispatcher or who you are.  When you see somebody dying and something that's going down that's wrong, you should step up.  Yeah, see?  Public property.  We can walk right up to the fence.  Why is it that this tyrant said that she couldn't stand up there?  Why does the fence back there?  If you guys didn't want us to... Just hear me out.  Can I just talk... Gentlemen, can I just talk to you for one second?  Is President Trump going to come out of the building or something?  Oh, no, he's hiding in the bunker.  Oh, that's right. ",
