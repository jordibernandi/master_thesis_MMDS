            "text": "My fellow Americans, since this past Tuesday, you have watched with your own very eyes the level of corruption deep state that is running rampant in our country.  You're watching our election being stolen.  The largest election fraud heist ever in history is being done here in the United States of America, the freedom country of the world, right?  So what's going to happen here?  is up to you to restore back the faith in our republic.  The blueprint and the plan that has been given to you by our founding fathers is right there.  They told us at any point our government becomes too corrupt.  They no longer represents we the people.  We have the power to restore it.  So what's going to happen now?  There is no other 2024.  It is Donald Trump for president reelected in January.  That's it.  That is it.  We're going to wait for the courts.  We're going to let the courts decide what's going to happen.  But make your peace.  Make your peace.  We will not have an election being stolen from we the people and a puppet being put in place by the deep state.  We will never have another election ever.  So I'm reading some of these past conservatives talk about, well, you know, guys, if we lose, we lose.  We're just going to have to take it.  And in 2024, we have another chance.  Wrong.  Ron, we've been there.  We've done that.  If they commit election fraud to the level that they have done right now, we'll never have a real election ever, man.  You're not understanding what's happening here.  And as a communism survivor, I have warned you.  This is it.  The days are upon us.  We have trained and we have prepared for these days.  But it's up to we the people to restore the faith and to restore back our republic to actually drain the swamp.  So yes.  There is faith in our court still, and there is faith in our president and our leader, Donald Trump.  But these Democrats are talking about physically taking our president out of the White House using the Secret Service.  These Democrats, communists, are building a list and they're putting us in it, just like the fascists, just like the communists in Russia, just like they have done in Cuba.  And we're not going to tolerate it.  We're not going to wait to the last minute.  We're not going to wait until we are being put in concentration camps or we're being put into trains.  You're nuts.  We're not going to wait for that.  We have stood back and idle ourselves and waited and done everything we can.  But the corruption in America is so great, so deep.  You know, so evil that at some point in time, we have to get our hands dirty.  We have to sacrifice what our founding fathers did.  They left us a republic.  It's up to us if we can keep it.  And it's up to us to keep it for our children and our grandchildren and the future of America.  Remember, always, you are an American, right?  More than half of the country stands with us and stands with the president.  The whole country would have turned red if we would have had a legal law abiding rightfully election without being stolen, without the fraud that we have seen time and time again.  We actually had a right election as we were thinking we're gonna have on Tuesday by nine o'clock.  Donald Trump would have been president by now for a majority.  He would have won the popular vote, electoral vote, hands down, no other choice but our president, Donald Trump.  So there's no other choice.  So you passionate conservatives, and this message goes out to Dan Kershaw, who's talking about if we lose, we lose.  No.  No, no, no, it doesn't work like that.  You don't get to keep your, here's the thing with a lot of these rhinos and a lot of these turncoats, they're showing their true colors.  They just wanna keep their day job.  They just wanna keep their job.  They want to keep their career, you know, the new McCain of our times.  They want to keep their career, elected officials, do as they please to continue giving us exactly what we want to hear, but not exactly what we want to get done.  to keep us just happy enough that we can live under the misery and the tyranny that they want to oppress.  But that's not gonna fly.  That's not gonna fly.  We have too many millions of us here in America who have been standing down, standing idle, and waiting and waiting for the right people to do the right thing, like Barr, like all these officials, to do the right thing.  Okay, so we're gonna wait for the courts.  Donald plays Donald or President Donald Trump is going to play his card.  We're going to wait for the courts.  But if by January 20th, our President Donald Trump is not reelected by overwhelming Legal votes.  As it should have been done on Tuesday.  And the exposure.  Of the criminal acts.  By the Democrats.  And the rhinos.  And the media.  To try to steal the election.  Of the United States of America.  And people don't get arrested for it.  Then we patriots have.  No other choice.  And you know what choice that is.  You know exactly what choice that is.  I don't need to sit here and tell you.  Go read our history, go read our founding fathers, start reading and start reading the literature that they had given us, the blueprint and the plan on how we take back our country.  But there's not going to be another election.  We're not going to turn to Venezuela.  We're not going to wait for these fascist communists, whatever you want to call them, to take over.  And then they come and start coming door to door and coming after every one of us with our pants down because we did not do what we needed to do at the right time.  We're not going to wait for that moment.  And I'm telling you right now, man, when this happens, there will be no mercy for these communists.  There will be.  no, you know, these people think that they were going to take down Donald Trump, the bad orange man.  No, no, you did not take down the bad guy, you know, that you think he was the bad guy.  He was the only man standing between you and us.  He was the only man that was standing there to unite us all under one republic.  But you did not want that.  You did not want the republic.  You did not want, are we the people?  You did not want the president.  You just want a new communist utopia with your minority brainless cheaps that is only composed of 30%, probably less than 30%, probably less than 30% of our population.  Less, guarantee is less than that.  Probably like 10%, all right?  Because the votes show time and time again, especially with the minority votes, the black and Hispanic votes, that Donald Trump was elected president.  No other president has ever gotten the amount of minority votes that President Donald Trump got this election.  No one.  No one.  So we took the House, we took the Senate, and he's our president.  That's it, final.  We can go to court, we can showcase the fraud that has happened, all right?  But if the judges are tainted and the courts come back, and by January 20, our president Donald Trump is not elected, we get this buffoon, this clown who can't even speak, who can't even speak, right, as president, then you as a patriot need to become a full, 100% red-blooded American and start fighting for our country because we will not turn to Venezuela.  We will not turn to Cuba.  I survived 13 years of communism, and I got no other place to go.  This is it.  This is where I make my stand, and this is where I will fight for our president, Donald Trump. ",
