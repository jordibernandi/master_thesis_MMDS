I suspect that the confusion and consternation around this saying lies with both the chanters of the slogan and the resistors to it.  We could all use a step back to get on the same page here.  When someone makes a statement that is unclear or ambiguous, by far the best thing to do is to ask them to clarify what they mean.  I wish Dr.  Craig had.  so while i can't speak for everyone who uses sagan's slogan i'm going to clarify for you what i mean when i use it.  the word requires in a sentence implies an objective to be achieved or a consequence to avoid.  i require food To live.  My phone requires power.  To operate.  My car requires gasoline.  To drive.  Temporarily.  leaving out the controversial adjective extraordinary, Sagan's slogan would best be completed as Claims require evidence.  in order to convince me that the claim is true.  Now, as a slogan, that's not as catchy, so we leave off the end for brevity's sake, but it is implied nonetheless.  Dr.  Craig realizes this as well, and even appends it to his version. ",

            "text": "If you don't care about convincing me, you're not required to provide any evidence.  But if you do want to convince me, the slogan is attempting to describe what it would take.  And unfortunately, what convinces one person may not convince another person.  So this is a subjective target, as much as we might all wish that it were not.  Everyone is different, and no one is actually in control of what convinces them and what doesn't.  there are two main usages of the word extraordinary and both of them are in play here now.  when someone is making a formal argument and someone uses an ambiguous term in more than one sense in the same argument that is called an equivocation fallacy.  However, extraordinary claims require extraordinary.  evidence isn't an argument, it's a slogan.  Consider the saying, when the going gets tough, the tough gets going.  Most English speakers seem to understand this is an inspirational encouragement.  When difficult times come, those with fortitude take action.  In the same sentence, we utilize two different definitions of going, the path toward an objective, and to move, and also two different definitions of tough, difficulty, and ability to endure.  Our brains actually like this kind of wordplay in a slogan, even though we're not consciously analyzing the linguistic accomplishment.  So, what are the definitions of extraordinary?  First, going beyond what is usual, regular, or customary.  Quite literally, not ordinary.  Outside the usual.  When someone pulls out the extraordinary claims slogan, it is generally in response to a claim that, if true, would be outside the sphere of normality, to some extent.  Second, extraordinary can also mean exceptional.  Getting a perfect score on a test is extraordinary, even if that student often gets a perfect score.  A meal can be of the highest quality, even if that chef normally makes very high quality food.  It is in this sense that we say we are looking for extraordinary evidence.  High quality evidence.  Exceptional evidence.  The question naturally follows, what makes evidence more exceptional as opposed to less exceptional?  Evidence is something that helps us justify a conclusion or belief.  More formally, the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy expresses that if E is evidence for some hypothesis H, then E makes it more likely that H is true.  In such circumstances, E confirms H. so evidence that increases the likelihood of a hypothesis just a little is less exceptional than evidence that increases the likelihood a lot.  exceptional evidence points more uniquely to a particular conclusion.  to put a fine point on it.  when i say extraordinary evidence i mean evidence that very highly corroborates a specific hypothesis.

This is the opposite of asking for clarification from your interlocutor.  He substitutes highly improbable event for not ordinary.  There is a subtle but important difference here.  If you told anyone who knows me in real life that you saw me somewhere wearing a yellow shirt, they would immediately consider that to be an extraordinary claim.  Not because shirt colors are inherently improbable, but because it is almost unheard of that I will allow myself to be seen in anything other than black.  me wearing yellow while seemingly unremarkable would be far out of the ordinary.  more on this later.  he also substitutes establish the reality of for believe and in particular in the context of probability theorists.  now there are scientific standards for establishing consensus.  There are legal standards that vary based on case type, and there are even probability standards when something crosses the 50% threshold.  None of these necessarily have any impact on an individual person's credulity, on whether they personally will come to believe the claim.

            "text": "Now that's a bit of a sloppy example, because we know that when enough people are playing, the lottery awards winners nearly every week.  But let's steelman this to acknowledge that it's rare that any particular individual wins the lottery.  so let's consider the claim that a particular acquaintance of yours won the grand prize in the lottery last week.  perhaps there are second-hand rumors going around that someone in your town was the winner.  that's not remarkably specific and mainly hearsay but it could lend some support to the idea.  Perhaps you hear the news from someone who says they were with the person when the numbers were announced, and even saw the ticket for themselves.  If you judge that person believable, this is better evidence than the hearsay, but we also know that people can be honestly mistaken or misremember details.  Testimonial evidence is evidence, but has limitations.  Perhaps your acquaintance would let you examine the winning ticket for yourself.  You check the numbers, you check the date, note the graphic design elements, and the feel of the paper.  Someone with modest Photoshop skills could probably fake such a thing, but to the extent that the ticket seems authentic, its existence makes the claim more likely than just the story from your friend does.  Perhaps there's a newspaper article naming your acquaintance as the winner, with a photo of your acquaintance being handed a giant check from the president of the lottery commission.  An article and a photo op are even more difficult to fake or be mistaken than the ticket, so this is even better evidence of the claim.  Finally, perhaps your acquaintance is willing to take you to their bank, go up to a random teller of your choosing to pull up their bank records, and allow you to see a deposit into their account of $10 million from the lottery commission.  This is even better evidence of the claim.  Because there are very few reasons the commission would give out that much money to someone who didn't win.  It points very strongly to the claim.  Note that a bank transfer, a photo, a lottery ticket, a story from a friend, and a rumor going around are all entirely mundane.  They are usual.  They are extremely ordinary things in and of themselves.  In fact, a photo in the newspaper is probably less day-to-day ordinary than a record of a financial transaction.  But yet the more mundane bank transfer is actually the more convincing evidence.  What makes these things more or less extraordinary, exceptional, as quality evidence, is the extent to which they make the claim more likely than not.  Nothing intrinsic about what they are.  Note that somewhere on this graph is the point at which you would believe the lottery claim, which should be determined by how out of the ordinary the claim seemed to you.  If you know that your acquaintance routinely buys lottery tickets every single week, you might be convinced by the rumours alone.  If your acquaintance routinely mocks and laughs at the suckers playing the lottery, it might seem less ordinary and need more specific evidence.  If your acquaintance is prone to exaggeration and hyperbole, you might want even more specific evidence.  And if you're living in a high-stakes heist movie, perhaps even the bank deposit will seem suspect.  The more the claim varies from what you personally expect, the more specifically affirming, the more extraordinary, the evidence must be to you.  That's just the reality of how our brains work.  Make sense?  And for the sake of clarity and to cut down on comments, let's all acknowledge that evidence can stack or accumulate.  If you saw the winning ticket yourself, and you saw an article in the newspaper, those things combined would be more convincing than either isolated scenario.  But also keep in mind that the extent to which they stack will depend on the independence of said evidence, one's personal credulity, and other factors. ",

            "text": "And here's where we run into the problem.  The potential threat this slogan makes to one's feelings about the rationality of their beliefs.  But consider Person A. Person A believes in an all-powerful being, that this being routinely intervenes in the natural order of things, and that this being loves humans.  For Person A, there's nothing particularly out of the ordinary about this powerful being deciding to raise someone from the dead in order to demonstrate his love.  For Person A, this resurrection isn't an extraordinary claim, but rather a relatively ordinary one.  and so ancient writings based on second-hand reports is sufficient for them to believe.  but enter person b. person b is open to the idea of an all-powerful being but hasn't experienced anything in life.  they attribute to supernatural intervention.  For person B, to have someone raised from the dead is not impossible, but would be well outside the ordinary.  An extraordinary claim.  For person B, they know that sometimes people exaggerate, and sometimes people are mistaken.  So, anonymous ancient reports aren't enough to close the gap.  It's not to say that the gap could never be closed by anything.  at least hypothetically, but rather that the evidence so far has not been claim-affirming enough to do so.  Of course, it can work the other way as well.  Person C is a methodological naturalist who looks for material world solutions to problems regardless of their feelings about the supernatural.  Because Person C already anticipates that something chemical gave rise to the biological, they will see a study on natural processes creating the amino acids of RNA as a candidate explanation.  though also apportioning their confidence in the conclusion to the evidence provided, knowing new information might one day lend new insights.  The peer-reviewed study is sufficient for belief for person C. Person D, however, holds that only a divine being could create life, and therefore views any natural hypothesis as a wildly extraordinary claim.  Therefore, it's going to take significantly more conclusive scientific findings to overcome the gap in person D becoming convinced.  i can vouch for these examples as i have been person a person b person c and person d at various times in my life.  for dr craig the claim that the cosmos may not have had a beginning would be highly extraordinary and he himself would require extremely compelling evidence to convince him otherwise.  right dr craig?  that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence is not a commentary on rationality versus irrationality.  don't look at it that way.  it's an observation about how people come to be convinced of things outside of their normal experience and expectations.  And so, my friends, as clever as Sagan was in his words, it appears that poetry must give way to pragmatism in order that theists can understand our meaning.  So, here is our new slogan.  Claims of things that I do not perceive as usual require evidence that has sufficient claim-affirming properties to overcome my pre-evidential assessment in order for me to personally become convinced of said claim.  Should we put that on a t-shirt?  Thank you so much for watching.  For more of my video interaction with Dr.  Craig, tap on the Apologia vs.  William Lane Craig playlist and see how deep the logical fallacies go.  Until next time, later. ",
