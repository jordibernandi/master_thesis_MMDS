            "text": "Thank you for tuning in to Swoop's Films.  I wanted to do a fight review of the UFC fight between Jon Jones and Dominic Reyes.  This was a huge UFC fight.  They both came in at 205 pounds.  They're both six foot four.  Their fight styles are very similar.  Now this was a five round fight, five minutes per round.  I thought Dominic Reyes controlled most of the fight.  He landed the bigger punches in the fight.  He landed the bigger strikes throughout the fight.  And I thought he should have won this fight.  But they awarded Jon Jones as the winner with split decision.  I thought that was completely bogus.  I thought Jon Jones clearly lost this fight.  And I think they only awarded Jon Jones the winner is because he's the biggest moneymaker in the UFC.  He's the cash cow.  The UFC needs him to win in order to generate revenue.  And I think this is the reason why he was awarded the winner.  Now, I'm a huge Jon Jones fan, but I thought he clearly lost this fight.  I'm just being honest in what I saw.  And any person that sees this fight, you can clearly see that Dominick Reyes completely won this fight.  I would give him four rounds out of five.  It was really only one round where Jon Jones really showed a little something something, and that was the second round.  But the majority of this fight was controlled by Dominick Reyes.  And he should be the champion of the world.  He should have won this fight.  I hope they have a rematch because it was a very competitive fight.  But the majority of the big blows, the majority of the big punches and strikes were landed by Dominic.  Now, I know a lot of people have never heard of this guy, but this dude is a good fighter.  He's a very tough fighter.  He's probably the toughest fighter that Jon Jones has ever faced before.  And if they have a rematch, I think he's going to knock out Jon Jones.  But a lot of people have a lot of different opinions about this topic.  But I think the majority of people on social media are saying Dominic won the fight.  But tell me what you think about it.  If you saw this fight, tell me who do you think won the fight.  Leave a comment, rate, and subscribe. ",
