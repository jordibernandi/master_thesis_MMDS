The original was illustrated by an artist named Rudolf Salinger for the 1965 publication called Early Man from Time Life Books.  It is unfortunate that this image went on to be so iconically associated with the overall theory of biological evolution, because it is a fundamentally flawed and inaccurate representation.  First, evolution is an entirely unguided process.  The idea of progress is irrelevant and incorrect.  The process of evolution increases survival in populations in the midst of changing environments.  With the most recent ice age arrived, adaptation to cold weather wasn't progress in any kind of linear sense, just changing with the times.  second the image depicts as linear what is decidedly not a straight line.  most of the hominid species depicted in the full image are not at all considered direct ancestors of homo sapiens but rather as cousins on other branches of the tree and there is significant temporal overlap for these species.  This step-by-step depiction gives the wrong idea of replacement.  Indeed, the text on the page describes exactly what I've described.  But who reads words when there's pictures, right?  Author of the book, F. Clark Howell, remarked, The artist didn't intend to reduce the evolution of man to a linear sequence.  but it was read that way by viewers.  The graphic overwhelmed the text.  It was so powerful and emotional.  As Stephen Jay Gould explained in his chapter of Wonderful Life, condemning this image and the misconceptions it has wrought, life is a copiously branching bush, continually pruned by the grim reaper of extinction, not a ladder of predictable progress.  Alright, so now we know that this image is an entirely false representation.  What observation does Ray have about it? ",

Over the course of the book, Darwin describes Australian Aborigines, Mongolians, Africans, Indians, South Americans, Polynesians, and Eskimos as savages.  It becomes clear that he considers every population that is not white and European to be savage.  The word savage is disdainful, and Darwin constantly elevates white Europeans above the savages.  Darwin explains that, quote, the highest races and the lowest savages differ in moral disposition and in intellect.  That is, they're immoral and they are not as intelligent as the white folks.  And then it continues, quote, as white Europeans exterminate and replace the world's savage races and as great apes go extinct, Darwin says that the gap between civilized man and his closest evolutionary ancestor will widen.  The gap will eventually be between civilized man and some ape as low as a baboon instead of, as at present, between the Negro or Australian Aborigine and the gorilla.  That's page 221 of The Descent of Man. ",

This time, he takes an excerpt from an essay done by an undergraduate in literary theory taught at Williams University and attempts to pass it off as someone's thesis.  Besides his mischaracterization, the essay itself paints Darwin as a racial bigot who promoted right supremacy within his body of work.  Let's not pretend as though people during the 1800s had a very high opinion of those of other races, but Darwin and his family were quite different as they were staunch abolitionists.  The following is a quote found within the same source material as Comfort's Misbegotten, quote, \"'Slavery, although in some ways beneficial during ancient times, is a great  crime.'\".  Yet it was not so regarded until quite recently, even by the most civilized nations.  And this was especially the case because the slaves belong, in general, to a race different from that of their masters.  During this time period, there were many missteps within the realm of science and human rights.  Yet Comfort's contrived issues here are not one of them.  The machinations of racial discrimination existed long before Darwin was born, with science occasionally contributing to them, phrenology being one example.  Such concepts made their way out of the scientific sphere due to the lack of evidence and not divine intervention.  There is, however, a bit of irony with Comfort's assertions.  Two years after On the Origins of Species was published, John Henry Hopkins, the eighth bishop of the Episcopal Church, wrote The Bible View of Slavery, where he openly justifies the practice and criticizes abolitionists.

However, as thrilled as I am that Ray is a part of the all-consuming feminist agenda that will eventually overthrow the West, I have to rate on his parade a bit.  Biological anthropology, or the study of human evolution, is absolutely wrought with women.  There is the work of Jane Goodall and Dian Fossey with extant primates, Mary Leakey with some of the most important fossil finds of the hominids, and the innumerable female anthropologists, paleontologists, and primatologists working today, some of them my very own professors.  Perhaps we could turn to one of the big three of the classic transitional fossils, and the only one to have an assigned sex, Lucy, the female specimen of Australopithecus afarensis and veritable poster child for paleoanthropology.

Being bipedal animals, the hominins, that is to say, all of our primate relatives succeeding the human-chimp split, have a more narrow hip than the knuckle-walking or arboreal apes.  This allows us to hold our weight directly above our legs and move around more efficiently.  But bipedality and big brains can be a lethal combination.  Big brains require wider hips, meaning there was a powerful selection for the widest possible hips in females while still maintaining locomotion efficiency on par with the males.  It turns out this really just isn't all that much wider.  But it is wide enough to measure.  This allows us to tell the sex of specimens of hominins, and allows us to tell if the species exhibited sexual dimorphism by tracking other differences between males and females.  Sometimes this difference is great, sometimes it isn't.  But without the pelvis, it would be more difficult to tell.  He is right that racism and sexism have no place in science, and Charles Darwin frequently gets pinned with accusations of both.  Living in the 1800s, Darwin was absolutely a product of his time, as anyone alive in those days would invariably be.  But although Darwin discussed the various proposed races of men and wrote about male superiority to females due in part to sexual selection, he was also a fierce abolitionist.  His female colleagues in science additionally corresponded frequently with him, and Darwin's letters are filled with encouragement and support for them.  Essentially, he probably was a little racist and sexist to our modern eyes, but it would have been relatively progressive for his time period.  This can be investigated by anyone out there using the Darwin Correspondence Project website. ",

Well, similar to the speciation we see in organisms today, there is rarely a single generation that both progenates a new species and marks the first population considered reproductively isolated from the previous species.  In fact, recent work in genetics has suggested that the Australopithecines could have perhaps interbred with the last common ancestor of humans and chimps, say, Helanthropus chadensis, some three million years its senior.  This potential hybridizability is the case with most species that cohabitate the Earth with members of its genera, particularly if they also inhabit the same part of the world.  For every male member on the March of Progress, or the far more accurate phylogenetic trees of hominins, there was indeed a female.  And for every female, there was a male.  This is how ecology, speciation, and reproduction works, and has worked since the dawn of sexual reproduction. ",

Because he imagines that evolution predicts that one day a lizard will give birth to an elephant.  His notion becomes all the sillier if it requires that breeding pairs pop out.  but instead evolution predicts that each child will inherit the traits of its parent or parents.  the creatures that reproduce sexually have common ancestors that reproduced sexually.  once established this trait was passed down to all of us.  it didn't have to emerge from scratch over and over for each new species.  this is why the question of one kind becoming another kind betrays a fundamental lack of understanding of what evolution actually predicts perhaps in part due to that march of progress.  image descendants of eukaryotes will specialize eukaryote traits.  descendants of vertebrates will specialize vertebrate traits.  Descendants of mammals will specialize mammal traits.  Descendants of apes will specialize ape traits. ",

But unfortunately, because Ray's understanding relies on inaccurate 60-year-old memes, his attacks miss the mark and fall flat.  There are, perhaps, interesting discussions to be had about the biological factors that contribute to gender roles, or in-group, out-group dynamics.  But first, we must recognize that biological evolution has never been about progress or strength.  It is now, and has only ever been, an explanation for diversity.
