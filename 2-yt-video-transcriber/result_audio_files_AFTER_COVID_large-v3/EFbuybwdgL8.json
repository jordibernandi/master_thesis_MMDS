            "text": "My name is Daniel Kibblesmith and I am the writer of New Warriors number one.  Okay, let's do this.  The New Warriors are the authority figures in this story.  They have to be mentoring new New Warriors.  So the first character that we're introduced to is Trailblazer.  She's a group home and foster kid who is volunteering at a senior center.  We picked the name Trailblazer because she's somebody who charges into action.  She knows that she can do some good with this mysterious gift that she's been given.  Screen Time is a internet kid taken to its sort of logical conclusion.  As a youth, he was exposed to his grandfather's experimental internet gas, and that has patched him permanently into the World Wide Web.  Because we're doing a story about teenage rebels, a lot of the names are about teens fighting against labels that are put on them.  Snowflake and Safe Space.  They don't see as derogatory to take those words and kind of wear them as badges of honor.  Safe Space is kind of a big, burly, sort of stereotypical jock.  He can create force fields, but he can only trigger them if he's protecting somebody else.  Snowflake is non-binary.  End goes by they-them.  I don't know what that means!  The connotations of the word snowflake in our culture right now are something fragile.  And this is a character who is turning it into something sharp.  I summed it up!  Snowflake is the person who has the more offensive power.  And safe space is the person who has the more defensive power.  Right, okay.  The idea was that they would mirror each other and compliment each other.  E negative is the goth kid.  When he was a baby, he got a rogue life-saving blood transfusion, we assume from Michael Morbius.  And it's also a proud ownership of the idea of having a bad attitude.  I want the people who read Our New Warriors to feel all of the excitement that they felt if they read the 90s one.  A diverse cast, which is something that the New Warriors titles have always strived to make a priority.  You should be comfortable with it.  Just, just, there you go.  It's a good role of them.  Every New Warriors comic has always felt like a reflection of the year that it came out.  And I don't think we're worried about being dated.  I think we're way more interested about it being now.  I don't know why that's so funny.  Oh, God. ",
