In many instances, they have functioned with valor, with great courage.  Is it your suggestion that we throw everybody out of the military who is gay? ",

I think not.  What we're talking about here is justice.  Do we judge men and women on their ability to do the job, to be good soldiers?  Or do we say to somebody, you're gay, you may not enter the armed forces.  Our economy is falling apart, we don't have national health care.  What we're talking here, to my mind, is a simple issue of justice and civil rights.  What America is supposed to be about is judge people on their ability to do the job, not on their sexual orientation. ",
