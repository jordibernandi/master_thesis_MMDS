            "text": "Hello everyone and welcome to The Vortex, where lies and falsehoods are trapped and exposed.  I'm Michael Voris.  As a quick reminder, tonight at 6.30 Eastern, we will be live streaming our special report on the McCarrick Report, released yesterday.  So tune in tonight at 6.30 Eastern for our in-depth analysis of that McCarrick Report.  If you miss the live show, the replay will be up by 8 p.m.  Eastern.  All the cheats and liars are issuing calls for unity and peace now that they appear to have the upper hand.  On the political scene, it was fake Catholic Joe Biden's primary point in his speech to the nation on Saturday night.  Meanwhile, those who do and will control him, like Occasional Cortex, as just one example, are saying things like lists need to be created of Trump supporters, so they can be shut out of society once the Marxists assume power.  And yes, that's exactly what she said.  Keep a database of Trump supporters to ensure they don't get hired later on.  She also took to Twitter saying, quote, is anyone archiving these Trump sycophants for when they try to downplay or deny their complicity in the future?  And if that's not enough, the blacklist is being pushed by an ex-Obama spokesman as well.  But some stalwarts on the right, like Chairman of the American Conservative Union Matt Schlapp, took to Twitter and said this about the fake calls for getting along.  Quote, for Democrats calling for unity, you may want to actually stop counting illegal votes in Nevada first.  And he could have continued on much more extensively from there, illegal votes and counting them in Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arizona.  On this matter, according to a survey released this morning by Rasmussen, two weeks before the election, only 6% of voters thought their votes would be counted incorrectly.  Today, that number has more than quadrupled to a whopping 28 percent.  More than a quarter of the U.S.  population has serious doubts their vote was treated fairly.  Add to that that findings from Monday show 70 percent of Republicans believe the election was neither fair nor free.  These are gigantic numbers, and they reflect the reality that if Biden is sworn in, a large number of Americans will regard his presidency as illegitimate, meaning he and the Marxist Democrat machine that has control of nearly all the states in question simply cheated, and cheated on a grand scale.  For more than four years, Americans were dragged through the daily bombardment of a pack of lies about Trump and anything they could pin on him.  Russia, the Ukraine, COVID, racism, rioting, the economy.  If it could stick, they threw it at him.  The Democrats traffic in lies, and so too do a number of Republicans who are in league with them in the swamp.  And speaking of the swamp, the U.S.  bishops as a body have been just as despicable, actually more so.  And the release yesterday of the long-awaited McCarrick Report drives that point home even further.  Pope Francis is completely exonerated from any guilt or complicity in resurrecting McCarrick.  So too are the closest associates of McCarrick, who were believed unquestioningly when they claimed they were shocked to learn of this for the first time in the Summer of Shame.  It was all the fault of a canonized saint, the report concludes, and a handful of dead guys, and Archbishop Vigano.  The report goes on for huge portions about the details of McCarrick's foul deeds, like we all don't know that already, salacious details aside.  But when it comes to revealing certain things, like the network that protected him, cooperated with him, personally profited by protecting him with their silence, it falls completely silent.  Except, of course... for the dead guys and Vigano.  The report is, as long suspected, a giant whitewash, admitting mostly what was already known and reported by outfits like Church Militant, as well as many in the secular media.  For example, it speaks of McCarrick being well-known for his cash payments, the envelope culture, it's called, detailing that he used to hand out envelopes full of large cash payments.  But it steers very clear of saying who he gave them to.  McCarrick handed out cash payments, large sums of money, routinely for decades, especially to many in Rome.  He used to carry that cash in his diplomatic pouch while traveling.  But it's certainly strange that the report confesses that, again, already well known, but deliberately fails to say who got the cash.  Likewise, the most well-known victim of Uncle Ted, almost two decades of reprehensible abuse, James Grine, is never mentioned by name.  His entire life is reduced to a mere footnote near the end of the report and only then in reference to St.  John Paul.  to have assembled a report on McCarrick with no reference to Grine whatsoever would be like issuing a study on the Scriptures without writing one syllable about the Holy Spirit.  Unless you're a person fascinated with level of detail about something you already have working knowledge of, this report is a waste of time.  The very information so urgently sought of Pope Francis simply is not there.  It can't be.  His inner circle, those who owe their careers to McCarrick, are the very ones advising and counseling the Pope.  And Pope Francis knows that.  So what's the relationship between the lies coming from the political left and the deception coming from Rome?  Well, they're both pretending that they want unity, but they spoil the word.  Faithful Catholics and conservative Americans have simply lost trust in the respective institutions and those who run them.  Giant Tech, Joe Biden, the news media, higher education, you name it, they're no longer to be trusted.  Likewise, Rome, a cesspool of deceit and cover-up.  and neither camp is ever held to account.  In this life, that is, they want a phony unity built on the lie.  And what is the lie?  That what matters is this world and this world alone, with no reference to God.  The political Marxists out and out deny God and instrumentalize the goods of the earth.  The theological left doesn't out and out deny God, but they instrumentalize the things of God.  But each group is serving the devil, period.  There's no such thing as unity built on a lie.  Unity can only be had when it is built on truth.  The Vatican, as well as DC, have placed themselves in the service of the lie, both politically as well as theologically.  This must be resisted with every fiber of your being.  You must fight this evil, even if you have to die in the fight.  But surrender is not an option.  Compromise with the devil in politics, and especially morality, is how a person's earthly life, and most especially eternal life, are doomed.  Remember, 6.30 Eastern tonight, Church Militants' analysis of that McCarrick Report.  Tune in.  God love you.  I'm Michael Voris. ",
