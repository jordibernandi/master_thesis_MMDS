            "text": "This is Richard Wolff with a response to an Ask Prof Wolff question from our Patreon community.  This question comes from John Jurecki, and it's a really good question about the relationship between the coronavirus on the one hand and the stock market drops and gyrations on the other.  John asks whether the coronavirus is the cause of all the turmoil in the markets, or whether it's a convenient scapegoat.  So let me get right to the nub of the question as I understand it.  There are dozens, more than dozens, of reasons why the stock market is in a very dangerous place.  And my view is that almost anything could set off the long overdue correction.  That's the polite word that people on Wall Street use, a correction, as if the stock market has misbehaved and is now going to be corrected.  This misbehavior is in fact the regular way capitalism works.  For the 300 years that that system has been growing and becoming dominant now over the whole world, Capitalism, wherever it is settled, has had an economic downturn every four to seven years.  Sometimes they're long and hard and deep.  Other times they're short and shallow.  But they're always there.  The average is four to seven years.  Sometimes it's a little longer, sometimes it's a little shorter.  Four to seven is the average.  In other words, this system has a built-in instability that is stunning and has been the focus of criticisms of capitalism from its beginnings.  Well, the last time we had a downturn in the U.S.  economy was in 2008 and 2009.  So we are overdue, because it's more than four to seven years.  It's closer to ten years since we've been in the last one.  So we're overdue.  Things have gotten kind of weird in the market, and so anything could set it off.  The coronavirus could be the stimulus that sets it off.  The collapse of oil prices over Sunday and Monday of this week is another example, and there are many more.  Any kind of health crisis. ",
