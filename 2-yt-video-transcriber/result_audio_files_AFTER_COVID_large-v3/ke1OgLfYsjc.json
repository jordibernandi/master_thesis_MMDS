            "text": "How's everybody doing?  My name is Anthony Bryan Logan and today we got to talk about the shooting that happened at the Black Lives Matter so-called protest in Austin, Texas a day or two ago.  Now, I think we all know before I get into it, I think we all know that these protests are not protests.  They're really riots, violent insurrections, places of general chaos.  We all know that to be true and I have yet another example of why that's true.  Now, Let's back up a little bit here to give you some backstory and context.  And then I get into the full story.  Now, there was a BLM protest, quote unquote, in Austin, Texas.  I'm not really sure why.  Austin, Texas, maybe because you have all these California liberals moving out there and other liberals in general moving out there, making Austin less like Texas and more like California and the left coast in general.  But that's a different story.  I digress.  There's a BLM.  event out there in austin and of course they're blocking the streets.  as usual a driver is just trying to get through the crowd to get from point a to point b and he happens upon this little blockade.  he's honking his horn.  he's not driving through him he's stopping.  he has his brake lights on.  he's trying to just get through and you know get to his destination and All of a sudden, he's been surrounded by all these people.  And the guy who got shot, Garrett Foster, had his rifle pointed at the car.  Now, at this point, the details get kind of murky.  There's a couple of stories out there.  The first story that I heard, which probably is not true, is that Garrett, the guy with the rifle who actually ended up getting shot and died later.  The first story is that he shot into the car first with his rifle and missed each shot.  Then the driver shot back and hit Garrett, and that's how he died.  The second story, which is probably the most accurate, is that Garrett had his rifle pointed at the car, and then the driver, fearing for his life because you're stopped, it's a big mob, ain't no police right in front of you, you have no real help, and the guy has his rifle on you.  He feared for his life and shot Garrett.  He drives off after Garrett hits the ground, and then somebody in the crowd fires their gun at the car as it's driving off.  Now, if you want to see a video, you're not going to be able to see anybody get shot, obviously, but what you're going to hear in the video are the gunshots.  I think you're going to hear five gunshots and then three more.  The five gunshots could have been from Garrett's rifle, and then the other three could have been from the driver.  But what's most likely is that the five shots you heard from the beginning were from the driver.  And then the other three were from the person and the crowd firing at the driver as he drove off.  I'll link to that in the box below just for your reference.  But that's what's going on.  The driver.  is i think either in custody or have a question by the police.  he probably won't get charged because you're fearing for your life in that situation.  you're being surrounded.  guys is gonna point it at you and i heard that the guy garrett who got shot and is dead now opened one of the driver's doors.  either it was his passenger side rear or passenger side door like right there where he's at.  so if you got your rifle on me you open in my car door.  i'm surrounded by a mob of people.  what am i going to do other than shoot you.  I wouldn't be trying to hurt anybody with good grief.  Can I get to my destination?  Get away from my car.  Don't put your rifle on me or you're going to face the consequences.  And that's probably what happened.  Now, of course, the media are treating Garrett Foster as some kind of victim or a martyr.  He's like a media darling right now.  The New York Times are trying to paint the guy that got shot, Garrett Foster, as some kind of victim talking about, oh, he really just enjoyed practicing Second Amendment rights, First Amendment rights.  And that was cut short.  The driver was threatening the people outside, the so-called protesters with his car.  And he was violent, all this and that.  But that's just not the reality.  And I also want to point to Garrett's fiance, a black woman who was a quadruple amputee.  Now, I'm not sure how that happened, why she had those limbs removed.  I'm reading that it could have been medical malpractice, but I don't know.  I have no idea what's going on with that, but... They were engaged to be married.  He's been painting that some guy that just wants to care for her.  He was pushing the wheelchair through the intersection.  And then all of a sudden, here comes this big, big, racist, white guy, Trump supporter and shoot some dead.  OK, none of that is known at all as far as.  what color he was or the political affiliation.  all that we do know and what we have evidence of and what we have statements for is that the driver was driving his car getting from point a to point b. he stopped by a mob and then one of the guys has a gun.  that's picture that's all that.  and then the guy with the gun ends up dead.  It is what it is.  All right.  And earlier in the day.  And again, I'll put this video in the box if you want to see it for yourself.  Garrett was doing an impromptu interview on the street.  And then he's asked about why he's carrying his gun.  And he's like, well, they say we can't march in the street.  So I'm going to just practice some of my rights.  I got to write the bare arms.  I'm going to just do that.  And then the person was asking him about.  Anybody that might feel differently than him, is he afraid of that happening?  He was like, nope, they're too.  And I got to censor it a little bit here because it's daytime TV or daytime YouTubes.  They're too afraid.  That's not the word to use.  They're too afraid to come out here and do anything.  So they're not going to do anything.  Speaking about the other side.  Well, apparently he was wrong about that.  Apparently somebody will do something as the great Ilhan Omar would say.  And now he's dead.  So it is what it is, man.  You know what?  I think these people need to stop because you're going to find people that are not just going to be victims.  I'm not going to just sit there in my car and let you just do whatever you want to me, open my door, punch a gun, maybe even shoot me and kill me.  I mean, we've seen that happen.  There was an incident in Provo, Utah at a Black Lives Matter rally.  Provo, Utah.  How many black folks live in Provo?  Different story.  I digress.  Anyway, there was a BLM so-called protest.  Again, riot, insurrection, general place of chaos where a guy, it was in the same situation.  He has his car.  He's trying to get through the crowd.  He's not running anybody over.  He's pretty much stopped.  He's trying to inch forward to just go to where he has to go.  And somebody from the crowd that was identified and got arrested shot his gun into the car.  I think the driver or a passenger may have gotten injured from the gunshot.  I don't think anybody died.  Thank God.  But he shot his car and he shot his gun into the car.  And then as the car sped away to get away from the person that just shot them or shot at them, somebody else had their gun pointed at the car and could have shot too.  So it was like, we know what these people are gonna do.  We know that if you got guns, especially at night, the Provo situation was in the middle of the daytime.  It was broad day, you could see them.  But this one was at night and there's no police right there.  There's no real security right there.  What are you gonna do when the mob is upon you?  You're not trying to hurt anybody, not trying to do anything, but what's going to happen?  These people out there gotta stop.  Stop blocking traffic.  Stop pointing your gun at people for no reason.  Just stop it.  You need to go home.  You're not actually solving anything with this, okay?  Why are you out there for two months straight in Portland?  What have you actually gotten accomplished other than making your city more dangerous, other than getting some kind of federal charge for trying to laser pointer in somebody's eyes, trying to blind them, or trying to attack somebody?  What have you actually gotten accomplished?  I see no progress at all.  people on the ground now for black lives matter the organization or they gave plenty money you know which is kind of weird.  people say abl you're not really conservative you're doing it for the money.  please.  if i was just a money grubber if i was a what they call it a grifter as a cool kid say if i was that i'd be on the left getting paid buku dinero.  you understand what i'm saying because Black Lives Matter got paid $20 million in donations in one day after the whole George Floyd kerfuffle.  So if I'm trying to get money, that's where it's at on the left.  Okay, they dominate the media.  They dominate all these NGO type organizations, the UN, the World Health Organization.  The real grift, the real money is over on the left.  I'm just sitting here talking to you today just straight from the heart.  how I feel, the guy Garrett Foster played a stupid game and won an even stupider prize.  That's how that goes, all right?  So if you wanna stay alive, if you don't wanna get shot, how about not, you know, false imprisoning people?  How about if a driver's on the road just trying to get to your destination, Let them pass.  Don't block me in my car and then surround my car and then point a rifle at me, open my car door.  What are you doing?  You're asking to get shot.  And in Texas, that should be self-defense all day long.  Like I said, stupid games, stupid prizes.  But I think I'll leave that right there for now.  And what say you?  Do you think that Garrett Foster... earned what he got?  If that's your viewpoint, let me know why in the comments below.  Or was the driver too quick to react?  If that's your viewpoint, let me know why in the comments below.  Now, if you think the driver was too quick to react, I don't really understand how that makes any sense.  You're surrounded, what are you gonna do?  if anybody is in that situation what is the next course of action?  i'm trying to figure that out for myself just so i know.  and then beyond what somebody would do what does the law say?  okay do i have the ability to?  just you know i think the police did interview the guy that was the driver and he's probably not in custody right now.  it's probably open and shut self-defense case.  it doesn't even matter if the Garrett shot first or if the driver shot first, the situation is not gonna change.  You're being threatened, guy's got guns on you, what are you gonna do?  You gotta do something lest you be a victim like many others have been throughout all these so-called protests, which ain't nothing but riots and insurrections that lead to more chaos and more destruction than was here before they started.  But whatever your thoughts are, please let me know in the comments below.  And that's all I got to say for this video.  If you like what you heard, please comment, rate, share, and subscribe.  Peace.
