            "text": "Well, I think when we look at this book, The Great Influenza, I just want to leave today with these three thoughts because I think we're answering right now the three concerns that I see in this book.  Number one, When you read this story, and I had a cousin who died in 1918 from the, you know, she was infected on a trolley car in New York City.  Really?  Three things.  Number one was a lack of preparation.  particularly public preparation.  Now, preparation is two levels, accurate knowledge and right tools.  Number two, there was a lack of clear communication.  And number three, there was a lack of a strategic recovery plan.  See, and what we're talking about on this show today is the lack of preparation as far as public preparation.  We're putting knowledge today in people's hands.  We're also putting tools in people's hands.  Secondly, we're trying to give clear communication as to the state of things.  Not causing people to fear, but to be on alert.  And there's a difference between panicking and being on alert.  You can be on alert without panic to fear, but we need to be on high alert.  This is high alert.  And thirdly, most importantly, which maybe we'll talk about on another show, is the lack of a strategic recovery plan.  What do you do, and even as Tucker Carlson just shared, what do you do when that many are infected and this is gonna go on for a couple of years, okay?  So anyway, that's what I'm seeing and I think the church, particularly this ministry right now, we need to be on high alert to say, let's counter those three things.  and I think we're doing, I think, Jim, you're doing a great job and this ministry is doing a great job to provide the solution that was missing integrated.

            "text": "america and we are the hope of the world.  we are the solution to the deal.  we should be from a place of security and peace informing this.  in the middle of this tumult we should be saying uh... here's the proper communication Here is the right knowledge to the best we understand it.  And here are some tools.  Here are some tools.  We're talking about putting the solution.  We're talking about the meals.  The silver gel.  We're talking about, again, going back to this book.  I looked at it again last night and then today.  the lack of preparation, and that's knowledge and tools, the lack of accurate communication and a strategic recovery plan.  That's what I've taken out of this.  And I mean, I'm not old enough to have known that cousin, but I know that my cousin died.  She was three years old on a trolley car in New York City, people coughing and hacking all around her that were let go from a hospital, not properly treated, and she died three days later.  So I think that this ministry right now, particularly everything we've mentioned today, is pointing hope and direction to those that hear what's going on.  But we should be on high alert. ",
