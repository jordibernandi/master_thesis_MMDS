            "text": "Shalom, I'm Messianic Rabbi Zef Porat, and welcome to Biblical Hebrew Foundation.  We're living in prophetic and exciting times.  There's never been a generation closer to the second coming of Jesus Yeshua than this generation.  We're not setting any dates, but we know that the time is near.  We know that the veil is being lifted, 2 Corinthians 3, verse 16, and Jews and Arabs are being saved.  Hallelujah, praise Yeshua.  We see what's happening all over the world, with the COVID-19, with the demonic outpouring, with the panic.  But we know that God has a plan.  We know that greater is he in us than the one in the world.  God said, I'm going to take the evil, the demonic outpouring, and I'm going to turn it into good for those who call on my name.  Genesis 50 verse 20, you intended to harm me, but God intended it for good to accomplish what now is being done, the saving of many lives.  Hallelujah.  During the COVID-19 crisis, we continue to preach the gospel here in Israel.  As Yeshua, Jesus said in Matthew chapter 5, verse 14, you are the light of the world because that light lives inside of us and shines in this dark world.  Isaiah 60, 1 and 3.  Arise, shine, for your light has come, and the glory of the Lord has risen upon you.  Nations will come to your light, and kings to the brightness of your dawn.  And that is a beautiful Bible verse, especially in the Hebrew text.  In Hebrew it reads, Verse 3 in Hebrew.  And in English, verse 3.  And kings to the brightness of your dawn.  Some translations say dawn in English.  Some say radiance.  Some translations, brightness, and some rising.  And all those translations are correct because it means all of that.  In Hebrew, it means all of that, because the glory of God is radiance.  The glory of God is brightness.  The glory of God is the dawn.  When the Bible says, and Mary visited the tomb, and it was dawn.  The word for dawn in Hebrew is also and it's also .  Depending on the context, one of the devil's name, Lucifer, is Shachar ben Halel.  He was a worship leader, a cherub, before he got thrown down.  The Bible says that he was a cherub.  He was a worship leader.  And one of his names is Shachar.  Shachar means Don ben Halel.  Don, son of worship.  So not only is that Bible verse saying that the glory of God is all over the earth, it's also telling us that he crushed Satan once and for all.  It's actually a compound prophecy, that Bible verse, because it shows what Jesus, Yeshua, did.  It shows what he's doing, and it shows what he's going to do.  Isaiah chapter 14, verse 12.  How you have fallen from heaven, morning star, son of the dawn.  That's an inaccurate Bible translation because Lucifer cannot be the morning star.  Only Jesus, only Yeshua is the morning star.  Actually, what it says in Hebrew, O how you have fallen, worship leader, son of Don, and not morning star.  Let's have a look at Isaiah 60, 1 and 3.  Arise, shine, for your light has come, and the glory of the Lord has risen upon you.  That glory is Yeshua, Jesus, hallelujah.  Nations will come to your light and kings to the brightness of your dawn.  That is the cross where Yeshua died on the cross on the tree for our sins.  He rose on the third day and by his blood all who call on his name shall be saved as he crushed Shachar ben Halel, worship leader, son of Don.  So this is an amazing Bible verse.  It shows how Jesus died on the cross on the tree for our sins, how he rose on the third day, how he crushed Satan once and for all, the son of Don, the worship leader, and all who call on the name of the Lord, Jesus Yeshua from all nations shall be saved and come to the brightness, to the radiance of your Don, the Bible says, which refers to the cross because that's where he crushed Satan.  Shachar ben Halel, worship leader, son of Don.  So he's not the morning star.  Only Jesus, Yeshua, is the morning star.  He was the worship leader.  He was the son of Don.  But he was crushed once and for all.  And that glory, that radiance lives inside of you if you're a child of the living God.  If you are born again, if you are under the blood of Jesus Yeshua, then you too have crushed the son of Don.  Because greater is he in you than the one in the world.  Today, it's the COVID-19.  Tomorrow, it's the COVID-20.  There's always going to be something.  We live in a fallen world, but to those that have the promise of eternal life, to those that are covered by the blood of Jesus Yeshua, we see something greater because that light is shining through us.  So what are we supposed to do during these difficult times?  Arise, shine.  For your light has come, Jesus has come, and the glory of the Lord has risen upon you.  Hallelujah.  The Bible says that when Moshe, Moses, came down from the glory of God, his face was radiant.  It was so radiant he had to put a veil over his face because he was so shiny.  In the same way, when the evil demonic outpouring of this world is attacking you your face is going to be so radiant so shiny that they're going to have to hide from you because greater is he in you than the one in the world hallelujah.  Yes, there's a deep state in America.  Yes, there's a deep state in Israel.  Yes, there's fake news.  But we can't be fooled because we have the good news of Yeshua Ha'ashiach, Jesus.  The battle's over Israel.  The battle's always been about Israel.  It started in Israel, and it's going to end in Israel.  The new heavens, the new earth, the new Yerushalayim, Satan knows that his time is near.  Satan knows that his days are numbered.  The Bible says in Revelation 12, 12, and I'm paraphrasing, the devil knows that the time is near and he's filled with fury because he knows that his time is short.  Arise, shine, for your light has come and the glory of the Lord has risen upon you.  So be encouraged.  Dawn Shachar ben Halel has been crushed.  He is defeated, and he knows that his time is short.  Rejoice, brothers and sisters, because Yeshua is coming soon.  And until that time, we will continue to arise and shine.  For our life, Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus, has come, and he's coming again to take us home.  And until that time, it's our duty as brothers and sisters to share the love of Jesus Yeshua, to preach the gospel, and to make disciples of all nations.  Thank you for joining me.  Let's continue to stand together as the one new man, Ephesians 2.15.  Bring the gospel back to Jerusalem and go home.  And until that time, We will keep on preaching the gospel, and for Zion's sake, we will not keep silent.  Isaiah 62, verse 1.  For Zion's sake, I will not keep silent.  For Jerusalem's sake, I will not remain quiet.  Till her vindication shines out like the dawn, her salvation like a blazing torch.  And we know that the word for salvation in Hebrew is Yeshua, Jesus.  Her Yeshua, like a blazing torch.  And he is coming back as Al Yehuda, the lion of the tribe of Judah, with fire in his eyes to take back everything that the enemy has stolen and to restore to you all the years that the locusts has eaten in the name of Yeshua.  And that's a promise from the Word of God from all those under the blood of Yeshua, all those that abide in His Word, all those that repent, die in Messiah Yeshua daily, as we make it to the end as the victorious bride.  I'm Messianic Rabbi Zev Porat, sending you blessings from Israel in the mighty name of the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, Al Yehuda, Jesus Yeshua.  Amen. ",
