            "text": "Good afternoon and welcome to the Wednesday afternoon conference call with Trusts Unlimited.  This is Jim George speaking.  I'm the non-attorney spokesman and facilitator for Trusts Unlimited.  I'd like to thank all of you for taking the time to listen to this call, particularly those of you calling in for the first time and those that will be listening to the replay over the next 24 to 48 hours.  We like to move quickly through these calls.  We know you're busy people.  You have other things to do.  as with last week, uh, events being what they are, this is going to be a very short call this afternoon.  Uh, there's a lot going on and, uh, I don't know why this keeps happening to me, but whenever there seems to be very critical hearings on the Senate floor or in the house, they start at noon on Wednesday, which is the time of our call.  Every couple of months, I'm fortunate enough to get into a call, uh, some of the larger agencies in Europe and they always seem to be at noon on Wednesday.  Well, I'm from the D in DC.  Many of them work in government and they have scheduled a call, which is starting, you guessed it, noon Wednesday right now.  So I'm going to get into that call very briefly.  What that call is going to be about is the knife fight that's going on in the Republican party.  I don't know exactly what's going on, but my conclusion is this, that the information that president Trump is threatening to declassify will not only destroy a number of Democrats, but a number of Republicans as well.  And so the Republican party is split on whether or not, uh, they're actually talking about impeaching Donald Trump.  So, It's just a very complicated situation, but be that as it may, I want to go ahead and get into the information I have with regard to the re-institution and revaluation of the Iraqi dinar.  First, of course, by way of disclaimer, Trusts Unlimited is not the purveyor of the dinar and these other currencies.  We're not advocating the sale or purchase of these currencies, but as rather substantial currency holders, we're sharing with you the information that we think is relevant.  The most poor, most relevant piece of information of course, would be the window for the re-institution of the dinar.  We still have a window for the first quarter of this year with the possibility, although that window is closing with a possibility of January.  Now, the reason January is possible is because parliament has completed their second reading of the 2021 budget, which means it's going to be voted into law.  Certainly within 10 to 15 days, they're going to need to re-institute the currency if they're going to use the numbers that are included in the budget.  Now, if that does not occur, that can create some complications.  Certainly if the federal government in Iraq, the government of Iraq starts making expenditures at whatever rate they have included in the 2021 budget, they can back out of that, but that's extremely complicated.  Now, the way they can get around that complication, even if they do not reinstate the currency in the next 10 to 15 days, is to simply withhold the governmental payments so that if they do reinstitute, they can go in and in a much simpler fashion restructure the deficit to reflect a reinstituted rate.  Now, part of the problem is the political factions are debating at present what the actual exchange rate for the dinar against the dollar should be.  And of course, the reason they've reduced the value of the dinar is because they're trying to collect them to complete the project to delete the zeros.  But if they can't come to agreement as to what the rate should be, that's tending to have a negative effect on that completion of that project.  So that's a further complication.  The other issue that they're facing is their monthly deficits.  The price of oil is still relatively low.  While the price of oil is generating 90% of the revenues to the government, the current price of oil is only at 65% or 70% of the projected price prior to the creation of the 2020 budget.  They also have the issue with COVID.  And so what they're going to need to do is generate revenue from another source.  They cannot continue to use the U.S.  dollar reserves that they're holding, that the CBI is holding.  They're dwindling quickly.  Borrowing additional funds is either going to be impossible or the terms are going to be unacceptable.  And the best solution short term would be for them to prop up their import and export business.  Now, the problem there is that until they reinstitute their currency, the import export business is kind of an impractical source of revenue.  But there are a lot of other issues that are pressing on Iraq in addition to the deficit and the problems they're having with the rate of the dinar against the dollar.  And that is membership in the World Trade Organization, final acceptance, Article 8 in the UN, and the lifting of the U.S.  sanctions.  In order for these things to occur, they're going to need to get their currency functional and get it on the Forex.  And, of course, they cannot get it on the Forex until it reinstitutes in country and it's a functional currency within the country, and they're using their own currency rather than the U.S.  dollar or some other reserve currency.  So that's the situation right now.  We're going to have to wait and see what the parliament does with final passage of the budget, and then we'll have to see how quickly they'll move to the deletion of the zeros.  Now, the other issue, and this is the most important one, is the U.S.  elections and the effect that they're having.  At this point in time, we'll know next week, at this point in time, I really can't tell you who's going to be the president of the United States for the next four years.  I know the election result.  I know what the states have done with regard to the electoral votes relative to each state.  I know what the Congress has done.  But there still continues to be substantial evidence that there was fraud involved.  Now, the Trump administration continues to suggest that they have information that the American people need to know before this can all be resolved.  I, for one, want whatever they have to be released as soon as possible, or I want them to just conduct an orderly transition.  I don't like the state of limbo that we're in because it affects us, and it has ripple effects around the world, and Iraq is one example.  Now, let's look at the worst-case scenario from my personal opinion.  Worst-case scenario would be a Biden administration, and I don't want to get into all of the policies in terms of domestically and in terms of foreign policy, their view of the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and all of that.  That's a discussion for another day, and some of that will probably be on the call that I'm waiting to get onto.  But, of course, a lot of our clients have really expressed concerns about a Biden administration.  They're concerned that this will be the green light for Iran to reinsert itself into the affairs of Iraq, and that's certainly a possibility.  There's some that fear that Biden will rescind Executive Order 13303, allowing us to participate in the exchange of the currency.  First, it's true that Iraq will probably have to be dealing with some of the intrusions of Iran But the U.S.  military is in place, and I just don't think that even if Joe Biden is elected, there's any way he can pump the brakes on what's going on there at present.  With regard to rescinding Executive Order 13303, I think that's really impractical.  One of the reasons President Obama, along with Maliki, did not support the reinstitution of the dinar back in 2012 and 2014 was wholly political.  8 million new American millionaires are not going to vote for bigger government and higher taxes.  So following that logic through, I don't see Biden rescinding 13303 because then he's going to have 8 million very angry Americans voting Americans that are not going to vote for a Democrat again.  Another reason why I don't see 13303 going away is because a number of politicians are are also denarians as well.  Now, some may think, well, they're politicians, so they'll get to do their exchange even if we don't.  They'll be in jeopardy of a clawback.  I don't think they're going to be able to separate themselves from, they're still a citizen of the United States, and the executive order has to do with citizens.  So I don't see that being a problem either.  Another issue is this.  The Biden administration very much wants to cooperate with the globalist movement.  And the IMF, the BIS, Bank of International Settlements, World Trade Organization, UN, all of these agencies, global agencies, want to see a single worldwide digital currency.  They do not want to see the dollar, I mean, the dinar pegged to the dollar or any other currencies.  So The IMF wants to see the dinar reinstituted because they want it brought to the forex, because they want it removed from a U.S.  dollar peg and pegged to the basket of currencies with the IMF.  So for all of these reasons, I don't think that a Biden administration is going to stop the reinstitution and revaluation of the dinar.  The problem on the other hand is all of the damage that's going to be done to us domestically in terms of the economy, in terms of the tax structure.  For example, let's say the revaluation of the dinar were to go through and then all of a sudden someone that's got a net worth of 800,000 has now got a net worth of 15 million.  Well, now that estate subject to the federal estate tax.  And if I don't miss my guess, one of the things that Democrats are going to do is reduce the exemption to the federal estate tax.  So the establishment of a trust program like ours is even more important.  Then there's the civil forfeitures and all of the things that the federal government can do.  The best way to control people is to control their health care and is to control their finances.  And the best way to control their finances is with a confiscatory tax structure.  And the only way to get around that is to utilize things like trusts and to protect your assets, to protect your privacy, to help avoid civil litigation, and if properly structured, to avoid probate to federal estate tax, and in some cases, taxes on interest and dividends earned.  So the next week is going to be extremely critical.  I'm going to get off of the call now, but before I do, and for the benefit of our newer callers, I strongly suggest you go to our call on December 16th which has all of the information about our turnkey program to assist you both pre and post RV and it has a good Q&A in there too.  You can go to YouTube and then go to Trusts Unlimited or you can go to IQD calls and go to Trusts Unlimited and pull up the call from December 16th.  We still have a lot of trust applications coming in so we will be working with those.  I've received a number of calls yesterday and today.  Obviously, I couldn't return any of those calls today.  I had a previous conference call before this one, and I was on some calls with some folks in D.C.  yesterday.  I'm going to be back on this phone call as soon as I get off here.  But again, I'd like to thank all of you for listening to this call.  I think we will, at the end, be able to go to the banks and exchange our currency, irrespective of what uh, administration is in, uh, running the country for the next four years.  Uh, everyone that's listened to the calls in the past knows that even if Donald Trump were to be reelected, they understand the reasons for establishing this trust.  But whether you're a denarian or not, if there is a Biden administration, you're going to want to set up a trust for a number of reasons, which we will begin to get into next week.  Uh, if we have some finality on, uh, exactly what's going to happen.  Of course, it always happens on a Wednesday.  January 20th, which is inauguration, is, again, a Wednesday at noon.  So there may not be a call next week.  If you call in and there's nobody at home, that's because there will not be a call for next week.  I will certainly try to get on if I can, but this is the situation as it exists.  Looks like the next week is going to be extremely painful for at least half of the country.  But we'll just have to take it day by day.  That's all we can do.  We're living in very historic times.  I've never seen anything like this in my life.  I hope I never see anything like this again, however it plays out.  But once again, we'll just have to wait and see.  We will be back next Wednesday. ",
