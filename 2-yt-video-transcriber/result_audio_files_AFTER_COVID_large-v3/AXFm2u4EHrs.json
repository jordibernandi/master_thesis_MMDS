So, I mean, that used to be the unofficial name of the virus.  But now that it's changed, I'd like to rename the website.  I bought a domain called germtracker.com.  That way, it's so much easier to remember.  And that way, I can also use it in the future for more global pandemics.  I mean, because, you know, there's only going to be another big thing a couple of years from now.  And, you know, I'll be the first one to make a tracker for it.  AMY GOODMAN. ",
