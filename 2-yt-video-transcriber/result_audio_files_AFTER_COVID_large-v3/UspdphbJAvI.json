            "text": "So I feel like.  for a long time, conservatives have been looking for some sort of blacklist, some sort of proof that Google is in fact de-ranking our pages and we are not crazy.  We have found these blacklists before, we've found proof of political censorship on Twitter and Facebook, but how does it work on Google?  Well, it turns out it's not exactly what you would think.  Yes, political censorship is going on on Google, but it is done in a far more insidious and clever way than any sort of just straight up blacklist.  A few weeks ago, I began speaking to a Google employee or rather a contractor to Google who gave me access to a guidelines document that is handed out to anyone who is contracted to rank pages.  Rankings essentially being whether a page appears on the first page of Google search or the two billionth page of Google searches.  So how does this correlate with political censorship?  Who does this actually apply to here?  Well, the company's Google contracts to rank pages are given this guidebook that I mentioned earlier.  It's around 200 pages, 174, and the employees are instructed on how to treat each page and individual using this.  to make some obvious examples, a page like Facebook, which would be considered highly reputable.  Lots of people want to visit it.  Even if you spell it wrong, it's going to show up every single time.  Whereas, Scam websites, things phishing for your credit card, trying to steal your information or give you a virus, that is ranked the lowest of the low.  It's going to be hard to find that on the Google searches.  However, there's also a bit of a gray area, and that is political content.  It's added to a section called YM, YL pages, your money, your life.  So effectively anything that can impact a reader or viewers money or life, financial advice, political advice, invitations to join a movement or rally, even just philosophical discussions, anything that can sway your view of the world and how you engage in it.  People like yours truly are considered a YM, YL page.  Google contractor employees are advised to give these pages extra strong scrutiny.  They must be ranked.  And if they fail to meet the observation test, they will be put at the lowest of the low level, literally with the virus and phishing scam websites.  I guess where I am, guess where a large amount of my content is.  Yeah, it's ranked pretty low.  I was wondering why when I literally Google Lauren Southern borderless documentary, Sometimes, in fact, often it comes up with people's reuploads of my documentary before it even comes up with my actual YouTube page.  And that is because as the contractor explained to me, my name when associated with certain keywords is ranked at the lowest of the low for searches.  But why me?  Why not pages advocating, say, joining a witchcraft cult or advocating communism and Maoism?  According to the contractor, these pages aren't deranked at all.  They are perfectly fine within Google's algorithm.  And the reason is, and listen closely here, within the Google ranking handbook, employees are told to use Wikipedia, local hate group watches such as the ADL and the mainstream media's opinion of someone to decide whether or not Google users should be able to easily find their content or not.  Wikipedia is run by far left activists.  The mainstream media is run by far left activists.  The ADL literally labeled the OK hand symbol as hate speech.  I'm sure you can see where this is going.  And as the Google contractor was explaining to me, it doesn't actually even matter what the content you are saying is so long as it's political and the mainstream media dislike you.  An example he gave was if Candace Owens posts a video and it's perfectly reasonable citing factual studies, not a single thing promoting hate, doesn't matter because of her reputation and because it's about politics, it must be deranked based on the handbook.  The handbook specifically sites pages that spread hate must be ranked at the lowest of the low category.  Yet it also clarifies that hate and violence can be spread in entirely polite and academic ways.  So essentially, even if you're being totally reasonable, totally factual, if someone finds what you're saying to be hateful, you will not be able to find your content on Google easily, if at all.  This also impacts comedians.  Take Steven Crowder.  He makes jokes about the LGBT community.  Often, they're just jokes, but it doesn't matter.  His Wikipedia page now says he's homophobic and therefore, based on the guidelines, he must necessarily be deranked.  Another fascinating aspect about this is page 44 of the guidelines, which says, If you speak out against expert consensus, you must be deranked.  So even if you have a pristine reputation, you're a doctor, you've got all the education, never made an error in your entire career.  If you say something about COVID that isn't mainstream, you will be deranked.  This applies to topics like global warming and anything in that category as well.  Also, conspiracy theories, anything that is considered to be debunked by sites like Snopes, which they actually cite.  Snopes in the handbook, deranked, done, gone.  Remember, these pages, anyone who questions the mainstream narrative, that's in the guidelines, in some cases are literally being deranked to the same level as virus, scam, and phishing sites.  It's terrifying.  This is a terrifying thing to have Wikipedia and the mainstream media deciding what content people can access on the most popular search engine in the entire world.  That is a terrifying amount of power.  in the hands of people who have so often been wrong throughout history.  We know the media lie.  We know the powers that be have destroyed the reputations and persecuted people that have genuinely tried to spread truth.  Just look at, historically, someone like Galileo, who was totally persecuted for having contradictory opinions to the mainstream on the orbit of the Sun and the Earth.  Or today, a more modern example, someone like Nick Sandman, who had his life destroyed by the media over total lies just because of one video taken out of context.  I hate to think of the fact that our access to information as a society is in the hands of these people, but it is.  And they're the ones who get to decide what we see and what we are blinded from.  And that is a civilizational changing thing.  To be able to convince an entire society that a whole group of people's opinions just don't exist.  They can't be found, erased.  And the only thing we can really do to combat that right now is hope that the battle against big tech rages on.  That sites like DuckDuckGo, which offer alternative services for search engines, become more popular as people want a genuine and honest view of information online.  I don't have all the answers.  I still use mainstream sites like right now because I want people to be able to see this information.  But I don't know how long this video is going to last.  I don't know how many people are going to get to see it.  All I can do is hope those with more power and ability than me to change things, see this video and take action. ",
