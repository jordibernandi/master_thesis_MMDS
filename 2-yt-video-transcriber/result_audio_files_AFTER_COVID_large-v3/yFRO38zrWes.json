            "text": "Hello.  Today is June 29th, 2020.  Another one of these critical thinking discussions.  Hopefully pretty brief.  Today we're going to discuss masks, vaccines, and stupid people.  Masks are considered a political issue these days.  And so we have the leftists wearing masks as they riot.  The Antifa.  We have the protesters, some of them wearing masks.  Some of these things.  I've counted less than 20% on some of the screenshots with masks.  That's why a lot of these protesters are going to get very ill because the virus is real.  It is a bioweapon.  It is killing people.  It's a very sneaky bioweapon and people that think masks are a political thing to hoodwink you and deprive you of oxygen are by definition stupid people.  I've used masks in boat building for years.  It doesn't affect your total oxygen intake.  This can be proven wearing an oxygen measuring device while you're wearing a mask and exerting yourself and seeing the differences.  I've never seen anything less or any reaction on any of these oxygen levels. ",
