            "text": "I'm happy to announce here today that the early edition of the Trump book is ready.  So to go get your copy, go to Amazon.com, type in the title, here's the title, Trump's Unfinished Business.  Ten prophecies that will save America.  Or, if that's too long to remember, just type in my name, but that's hard to spell.  Ciccolanti is spelled C-I-O-C-C-O-L-A-N-T-I.  Why another book on Trump?  Well, actually, I want to say this is not really a book about Trump.  We are just... Using the opportunity of a very important election to talk about things that are on God's heart.  Things that are biblical, things that will lead us to the second coming.  Things that are essential to usher in the second coming and the revival that will come before.  This is not another book about why did Trump win the 2016 election.  This is not another book about why should Trump win the 2020 election.  This is a book about why did God put Donald Trump in the White House?  Why not another person?  Why not a born-again Christian?  Why not a pastor?  What is God's agenda for this time?  And what is he called to accomplish, biblically speaking?  Because one day, the Democrats, the left, will get their wish.  He will be gone.  And what do we do after that?  What is the church meant to see And do, because of what God is doing through Donald Trump, and I believe eventually it will be Mike Pence, who is going to take the baton, who is going to take God's agenda to the next phase.  Perhaps it will be Mike Pence, maybe it's Don  Jr.,  he's just come out with a book called Triggered, and that's, I believe, just preparing.  You know, getting his face, getting his name out there, even though he's got a famous last name, people got to get familiar with him.  So I see they're preparing Don Trump Jr.  Maybe it's Ivanka Trump as the first female president.  Maybe it's Kanye West.  But I would say, Kanye, if you're listening, don't do it in 2024.  Don't do it.  It took many tries for Donald Trump.  Don't do it yet.  If you just became born-again Christian, you need at least, I would say, 8 to 12 years to prepare.  Get ready.  Get strong spiritually.  Become mature in the things of the Spirit.  And maybe one day, God will use Kanye West.  But God doesn't have to use a Christian.  I think this is one of the things that people are so stuck on.  And this is why Donald Trump came, and thank God, he actually claims he's a Christian.  He's very friendly towards the church.  He's constantly asking for pastors to pray for him.  That's an improvement from the last presidency.  But the point is, God doesn't have to use Christians.  He's very free to use anybody he wants, and he used Cyrus to decree freedom for the Jews and the rebuilding of the second temple.  He used Nebuchadnezzar, and he says, he is my instrument of judgment.  He told the Jews, through prophet after prophet, yield, submit to the Babylonians, and things will go well.  You will prosper.  Well, this is counterintuitive to Christians today.  This is why a book about Trump is not really a book about Trump.  It's a book about God.  but it's an opportunity to speak about these things because Christians were racking their brain wondering why did he win?  I think now you can see the evidence of what he's accomplished, what he's done, that he promised to do, he's actually delivering.  But what's really important is what God is intending to do starting through this man and then continuing through with Mike Pence, maybe another Trump, maybe Kanye West in the future.  There is a biblical template on how to govern nations and a biblical template on how to avoid a second civil war in America.  And it's very serious now.  The division, the divide in America is deep.  And the Bible has a solution.  So that's really what the book is about.  It's about justice, God's agenda, and the biblical template that the next leaders of the world can follow if they want to gain the favor of God.  When I heard God tell me to write this book, I did not feel qualified.  I don't feel, even though I have some political involvement here in Australia and I've worked with Christian leaders, I didn't feel politically qualified.  I only had biblical qualification.  And I could see from the Bible that as we're moving towards the end time, God is saying in Revelation, He says, Jesus made us kings and priests unto our God.  And I could see a deficit in the body of Christ.  I could see really hardly anybody publicly speaking about this.  That we have been made not just priests, but kings.  Kings is a political term.  How do people still believe that the Bible has nothing to say about politics when you've got 1 Kings, 2 Kings, Chronicles, Nehemiah, Daniel?  These are all political books.  These are all things that God said to the politics and the powers that be at that time.  How do people ignore this?  There is a deficit in Revelation.  We are forgotten.  We are forgotten what the Bible says.  Jesus is coming back to rule.  He's coming back to displace government power.  Corrupt governments of the world.  And who is he going to call upon?  Christians.  And this book is to help prepare Christians for that day.  We don't just get transformed immediately because Jesus arrives.  We are being trained now to rule and reign.  Not just to evangelize and build churches, which is all the agenda is right now.  We evangelize, build churches, so people can come in and evangelize, build churches.  Meanwhile, there's injustice in society.  There's corruption at the highest levels of government.  There's an overtaking of social engineering agenda in our public schools.  And Christians have nearly nothing to offer, nothing to say.  This book will change that.  It will be a part of the movement, a part of a third great awakening.  that will change.  I'm fully convinced that this book has ideas inspired by God because I did not think of them.  God downloaded ideas and revelations and agenda to me that you will see when you read this, this is not like other books out there about Donald Trump.  We are being trained to rule with our Lord Jesus Christ and this end time prophecy that a lot of people are interested in is not going to come.  Until something happens.  In Matthew 24, verse 14, Jesus prophesied, and this gospel of the kingdom, this gospel of the kingdom, not just a gospel of salvation and forgiveness of sins and grace and mercy, this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in all the world.  What's all the world?  That's North Korea too.  Kim Jong-un has to read my book in Korean.  That's Venezuela, that's Angola.  We'll be preaching all the world.  How does God want to rule?  What does His kingdom look like?  When it's preached in all the world as a witness to all nations, then the end will come.  So people say there's no precondition to the end.  No, there is a precondition.  We have to move beyond the stages of infantile spiritual growth.  of babyhood and move to a stage of maturity where we could offer up viable candidates for prime ministership, presidency, congressmen, and they're not going to corrupt the Word of God.  They're not going to push a legalistic agenda.  They're not going to abuse their power like many Christians have in history.  We have not done well.  Christians have not done well.  All the Christians that say, we will only vote for born-again Christian leaders.  Let me tell you, read history.  Read what John Calvin did.  Read what some of the Puritans did when they had political power.  And certainly, if you go through the Catholic Church, we don't even have to mention that.  The Crusades were Catholic.  The Inquisition was Catholic.  Nothing to do with the Protestant Church.  We were the butt of the persecution.  We were the millions who were persecuted, tortured, burned alive, and then we were the ones that fled to the new world, to America.  So people don't understand all of this.  There's an opportunity now.  There's a great awakening happening now in every sphere, from government to entertainment to movies.  There's a great awakening where God is raising up prominent people, celebrities.  What is this for?  This is not a game.  This is not just so that we could have more fun at church.  God is preparing for Jesus Christ to return.  But we must get our hearts ready.  We must know a lot of scriptures about the kingdom of God and about social justice, which the enemy has stolen this word, taken it away from the church.  So they don't even seek the church for wisdom in this area.  That's going to change.  It's about to change.  When you read this book, you're going to see a transformation beginning with us, with the church.  Some of the leaders will resist it.  I already predicted.  Some of them will oppose it and hate it because they're off onto one side of the Bible, only talking about mercy and forgiveness and not understanding anything about truth and justice and leadership and government and politics.  So much God has to say about these things.  Because I don't feel qualified in the natural world, And I kind of thought, will anybody read this book?  I mean, do I really have something from the Lord to offer at this time?  I decided to submit.  all of my chapters for review to a constitutional lawyer, to a university professor, to a Hebrew scholar, and even the lawyer for Roe v. Wade.  Well, actually, it's the lawyer for Roe in Roe v. Wade and the lawyer for Doe in Doe versus Bolton.  These were two decisions that brought abortion, legalized abortion in America.  The lawyer for that is my friend, and he's read these chapters.  And I want to tell you, I only got positive reviews.  I'm so happy.  And I got comments, this is much needed.  Amazing.  Well thought out.  One said, I didn't know about justice.  I'm only trained in law.  Imagine that.  That's the problem.  Lawyers are not trained in justice.  Judges are not trained in justice.  They're trained in law.  The Bible has more to say about it.  We need to know what does the Bible say about law.  We've abandoned that.  We've even mocked it and said, oh, the law has passed away.  Well, if the law has passed away, then whose law are we going to live under?  If you refuse to acknowledge God's laws, you will have to bow to man's laws.  And this is why we have rampant injustice.  I have a university professor from Korea.  send me this comment after reading one of the chapters, and he's going through all of them.  I'm really amazed that you follow American politics so carefully and your knowledge on many subjects is very deep.  I find the techniques that the American leftists use to distort the fact and the truth are also used here in Korea.  I can glimpse your understanding on the world politics and its relationship with God's kingdom.  It is a great opportunity for me to learn how God's principle is working in human society and how evil spirit tries to distort it.  So this is not just something I offer lightly.  I am offering this to the body of Christ with the review of qualified leaders in the body of Christ.  And I'm asking you as early readers to go.  Read it, help me if there's any improvement, if there's any minor corrections.  And the goal then is we have a very polished, a very good book to offer the world shortly after that so that the president himself and his presidential advisors, many of them are pastors who are presidential advisors, will get a good clean copy, a good solid copy of this book.  It's a very attractive cover.  Really appreciate the artists that worked on this.  And we'll be able to offer that to him and probably many other world leaders.  You know, in Korea, in the Philippines, we've got Duterte, who's very conservative and who's wanting reform.  And there'll be other leaders like that, maybe in Hungary, where they're very pro-Christ, pro-Christian, pro-church.  Man, when the Christian voters understand what the Bible says about this topic, things are going to rock and rattle and shake and It's going to change.  Things are going to change for the better.  This is the purpose of the Great Awakening.  This is the reason Kanye West has come to the Lord.  Justin Bieber has come to the Lord.  Even they don't know what God is preparing.  And it's not just to have more evangelistic meetings, which thank God it's happening.  It's not just to get a few more people saved.  Save and then what?  Save and become disciples of Christ who are prepared to rule and reign, to be both king and priest unto our Lord and to our God.  So again, if you need to know where to get the book, go to Amazon.com, type in Trump's Unfinished Business, Ten Prophecies to Save America.  Of course, there are ten prophecies that will save any country in the world, that will follow God's commandments.  Amen.  Thank you. ",
