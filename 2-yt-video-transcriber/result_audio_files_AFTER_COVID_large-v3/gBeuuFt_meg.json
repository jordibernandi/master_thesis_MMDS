            "text": "On the one hand, I remain a communist.  in what sense?  You know who is for me the saddest person?  I wonder if you would agree.  Habermas, you know, you're too young not to remember Habermas' reaction to German unification.  Habermas' primordial fear was the idea that maybe the West can learn something from East German dissidents.  That's why Habermas coined this horrible term, Nachholende Revolution.  For him, Poland... Havel, Czech Republic, East Germany, was just, to translate it, usually it's translated like this, a catch-up revolution.  They should join the West.  They just want what we have.  I don't think this works.  I think that the reason of all these confused protests that we are going today, Yellow West, Chile, whatever you want, it's precisely this is the final death of Fukuyama.  That is to say, I know it's easy to laugh at Fukuyama, but I claim, till now, 99%, even of the leftists there, I know where Fukuyama left is.  They basically thought, you know, even, I spoke with people like, he's too corrupted by Putin.  now, I don't like him, but Oliver Stone.  He told me, listen, capitalism is the only thing that works, and we just have to make it a little bit more, you know, women's rights, gay rights, health care, and so on, and so on.  But that, for me, left Fukuyamaism.  You accept the system.  I think that this confused protest coming today makes it clear that no.  Liberal capitalism is not the ultimate forum.  It will not work.  And precisely that's why I spoke about all those problems, just three today.  Migrants, ecology, digital control.  None of them could be solved in liberal capitalist frame.  It's clear that ecology, okay, it's good, of course, to play the capitalist game, to tax more polluters, but... The catastrophe they are awaiting, maybe you know this story, I love it.  My good friend Jean-Pierre Dupuy, an excellent, you should invite him here, the best theorist of catastrophes that I know, told me he was there as part of some European community delegation two days after Fukushima.  He told me that for a couple of hours the Japanese government was in total panic.  It looked that they will have to evacuate the entire Tokyo area, 30 million people.  Then, maybe they didn't have to, maybe they hushed up sometimes, I didn't care.  But what I want to say is that it's clear that we are facing problems where neither market nor state, the way we have it today, will be able to do it.  And that's for me the space for something that I prefer to call communism, not socialism, because today everybody is a socialist.  I read an interview, Bill Gates is a socialist.  Socialism means today, yeah, what you said, not too much egotism, we should take care of each other and so on and so on.  So again, No, but don't forget just that.  we lack, and I quote here my Marxist friend, Fred Jameson, we still lack what Jameson calls cognitive mapping, kind of a global narrative in a good sense.  I'm never a postmodernist.  We need big global narratives.  What goes on today?  You know what's for me the true tragedy today?  China.  China.  When people say communists always screwed up the economy, I tell them, sorry, do I hear you correctly?  Was there ever in the history of humanity, I exaggerate a little bit but not a lot, such an economic triumph as China in the last 40, 50 years?  Hundreds of millions were... were raised from poverty and so on.  And how did they do it?  The European left really hated two things always.  Unbridled market competition and strong authoritarian state.  The Chinese precisely combined these two, you know.  So what I... And this is the future.  India is much worse than China, of course.  Turkey, Putin.  A new authoritarian capitalism is... is coming up.  and I'm just a pessimist.  And I think that if you ask me what will happen, I'm so sad to say this.  I wonder if you have a, I mean, I get engaged.  Do you remember when there were elections half a year ago when unfortunately the left guy lost in Colombia?  I supported the guy who even thanked me with a letter.  He almost won, the leftist candidate.  So I do get involved.  But I still think that I don't have this old Marxist reliance.  We know the general situation.  We just need to mobilize the people.  No, people are getting mobilized outside our scope.  Take Yellow Vests in France, where my friend Alain Badiou proposed a wonderful formula.  You know what was his answer to Yellow Vests?  He said in French, .  All that moves is not necessarily read, you know.  We live in such a confused time where what was still 20, 30 years ago, a sign of active left, social movements, even obscenity, aggressivity, protests, is taken over by the right.  And the big temptation of the left is to play the law and order cards.  For example, in my own, as beloved president, I refer to him now as SG.  I don't use the term Trump, SG.  You know why?  SG, he repeatedly referred to himself as stable genius, you know.  So, as Trump would have put it, a shit hole of a country, Slovenia, where... It's horrible.  Of course one has to prosecute hate speech and so on.  But this desperate move of the left in my country, now they are all of a sudden for police investigation, punish them and so on and so on.  Nothing against.  I certainly don't want to defend... human rights of whatever race is.  I'm just saying that if you focus on this, it means again the lack of a certain positive vision and so on and so on.  You know, what we should not forget, I was really furious when After Trump won, three publishers approached me.  We need your psychoanalysis.  Would you like to do a psychoanalysis of Trump?  I said, no.  Trump is doing something which is in some crazy sense, rational from his standpoint.  I think the only way psychoanalysis is needed is the total stupidity of Democratic Party liberal reaction to Trump.  There you need psychoanalysis, you know?  So no, I hope, and you know why.  I'm not a total pessimist?  Not in the religious sense, but in a political sense.  Miracles happen.  Although they screwed it up fine, but who would have thought that Syriza, something like Syriza is possible?  Who would have... Things happen.  Things happen here and there.  Again, Morales-Linera were interesting.  I think they are a couple.  Because Morales, okay... I don't mean in a racist way.  He was traditional, blah, blah, all that.  But Linera is a top intellectual, you know.  I always like, that's the condition of the left, this false opposite to overcome them.  That's why... Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said something wonderful recently when she supported Bernie Sanders.  She said, yes, I support him, not in spite of him being an old white man, but because he is an old white man.  Because this is the worst false opposition to say we need this young marginal.  No, Bernie got this.  You know who are Bernie's voters in Vermont?  I know, I go often there because my friends there run the only department in the United States where Lacanians are in power.  His voters are precisely the people who otherwise would have voted for Trump.  This impoverished lower middle class part, this axis is crucial.  The leftist plan in the United States shouldn't be this Clinton opposition, let's be more moderate to get the center.  No!  Let's get to ask some of the Trump voters who are disappointed.  So no, I'm not a total pessimist.  The point that you emphasized, listen, let me finish with an anecdote which is my most beloved anecdote from Marx.  You know, in 1870, 71, Paris Commune, for a moment it appeared falsely, we know now that there will be a European revolution.  And Marx wrote in a letter to Engels in a panic, you know.  My God, they want a revolution now.  I didn't yet finish Capital and so on.  I can't wait.  I think we should not be ashamed of this trust in theory.  We need theory, we need to understand what goes on.  Thank you very much for that.  I think that's all the time we have tonight, folks.  My God, you are more Stalinist than me.  You can't eat democratic discussion, you know.  One guy, probably you gave him the question before, you know.  Thank you very much.  I talked too much. ",
