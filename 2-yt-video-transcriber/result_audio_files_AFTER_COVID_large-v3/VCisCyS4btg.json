It's in California where the governor says, It's absolutely essential avoiding mixing with people that are outside of your households.  OK, we won't go.  But wait, look at this picture.  Governor Gavin Newsom dining at the luxurious French Laundry restaurant.  No masks anywhere and multiple households.  Against his own rules.  Now you might have heard about Newsom's hypocrisy, but it was worse than we thought. ",

In Mississippi, Governor Tate Reeves held three Christmas parties.  Seems to fly in the face of guidance from his own health advisors.  How is that not in conflict with the order?  It allows us to really send a message to the people of Mississippi that you can return to a life that is somewhat normal.  Normal for politicians.  Rhode Island Governor Gina Raimondo maskless at a wine bar Friday night.  This just days after sending a tweet telling people to, quote, stay home except for essential activities.  There is this feeling, Governor, that you are constantly lecturing people about the rules.  Some people look at that picture and think it's hypocritical.  That night we were absolutely following the rules.  I was with my household, wearing a mask.  Washington,  D.C.'s  mayor demanded a 14-day quarantine for anyone going to states like Delaware for non-essential activity.  But then she went to Delaware to celebrate Joe Biden.  Her excuse?  I do a lot of things to advance the interests of the District of Columbia.  And some of them are formal and some of them are informal, but all of them are necessary.  If politicians do it, it's always necessary.  President Biden declared that masks must be worn on all federal property.  And then he and his family almost immediately broke his own rule at the Lincoln Memorial.  Donald Trump was a hypocrite, too.  When needed, I wear a mask.  He agreed to presidential debate rules requiring everyone to wear masks before the debate began.  But he and his family didn't.  And as it turned out, he had COVID then.  I think this was a blessing from God that I caught it.  At least Trump didn't dance in Times Square. ",
