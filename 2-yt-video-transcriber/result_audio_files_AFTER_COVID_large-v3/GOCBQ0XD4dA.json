In fact, the reason that the economy is so sick is not because of the coronavirus.  I mean, that's probably making it worse.  No question about that.  But even before the coronavirus came on the scene, the economy was ill.  And that's because of what the Fed did in the decade leading up to this disaster.  So what we're really going to be suffering from is the hangover from all of the stimulus of the past, all the zero percent interest rates and quantitative easing.  And what the Fed is doing now in the aftermath of this crisis is only going to compound the problems that it created before the crisis. ",

            "text": "Well, Peter, the last time you were on the show, you and I chatted about something.  I'm going to shift gears for a minute.  We talked about all this endless money printing, and this has got to be your worst nightmare because now the Fed has an open checkbook to cure all the ills here and be the buyer and lender of last resort.  But, you know, you were really hyper-focused on inflation, and I don't see inflation ever occurring for money printing, especially with the deflation that we're experiencing.  And one of your picks... was gold miners on the show the last time, and gold miners have been obliterated.  Even though gold is up 15% to 17%, most gold miners dropped 200% plus in this correction that we have.  So how can we have inflation going forward when there's no inflation?  The Fed's been trying to create inflation for the last 10 years. ",

            "text": "Well, first of all, most of the major gold stocks have hit new multi-year highs this week.  So I'm really not sure what you're talking about.  Yeah, there are some junior miners that have been weak.  But overall, gold stocks are doing a lot better than the overall stock market year to date.  Now, they should be doing even better.  given what's already happened to gold and what's likely to happen to gold.  And I think that's going to happen.  So I think people should be buying these gold stocks as quickly as they can.  But as far as inflation is concerned, inflation by definition is money printing.  That's what's being inflated is the money supply.  So we've never seen the central bank create this much inflation in its history.  To think that it's not going to affect consumer prices, I think, is completely ridiculous.  I mean, it already is.  Prices are rising for the things that people are really buying, like food. ",

I think some of your viewpoints, Peter, are divorced from economic reality on some of this stuff, because the way you frame them make them sound like that. ",

            "text": "It's your opinions that are divorced from reality.  Mine are grounded in reality.  When you create money, you are creating inflation.  Now, that inflation will manifest in various ways.  I mean, when the stock market went up a lot, when the real estate market went up a lot, it was inflation that was driving those price increases, not the real increase in the value of the businesses, but the nominal price.  And prices are going to rise.  the fed is putting money into the economy at a time where production is actually going down.  what's happening as a result of the coronavirus is businesses are not operating goods are not being produced services are not being provided.  yet we are creating more demand by flooding the economy with freshly printed money.  you're just focusing on certain prices.  yes airline tickets are down nobody is flying.  okay gas prices are down nobody is driving.  This is only temporary.  But look at what's happening to other prices.  They're already rising, and they're going to rise even faster in the days, weeks, and months ahead. ",

We have one minute left in the segment, so let me ask you the question this way.  I understand what you're saying, but I also see that production is going to get ramped up.  In fact, if the president is his way, it's going to ramp up sooner than later.  So in the last minute and a half we have, do you think it's possible that the inflation once again shows up in an asset bubble and it benefits the wealthy as opposed to the average person out there?

And if the government is not going to pay for it with taxes, they're doing it through inflation.  The government is funding the stimulus and the bailout by stealing the purchasing power of savers and spending it into the economy.  There is no free lunch. ",
