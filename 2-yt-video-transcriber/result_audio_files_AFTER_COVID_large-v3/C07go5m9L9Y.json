            "text": "Shalom, I'm Messianic Rabbi Zephora.  Happy Feast of Pentecost, Feast of Shavuot, the Feast of Weeks, also known in Hebrew as Chag HaKatzir.  Katzir means the Feast of Harvest.  And we know that Yeshua, Jesus said in Matthew 9, verse 37, He said to His disciples, The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few.  In the Feast of Shavuot, the Feast of Pentecost, when the power of the Holy Spirit fell upon them, It enabled the body of Yeshua, the body of Jesus, to go out and make disciples, to go out and bring in a harvest.  And that's why it's called the Feast of Harvest, the Feast of Weeks, Shavuot, 50 Pentecost, because they counted seven weeks, which is 49.  But on the biblical calendar, 49 sundown would be 50, the Feast of Shavuot.  We pray that this Shavuot, this Feast of Pentecost, the Jews in Israel, and around the world and the nations will come to know that Yeshua, Jesus, is the Messiah.  Yeshua is God.  And only through Him can we get redemption and eternal life.  As believers in Yeshua and Jesus, we already have the Holy Spirit because the Holy Spirit lives inside of us.  So how are we to celebrate the Feast of Pentecost, the Feast of Shavuot?  The disciples that were with Yeshua, they also had the Holy Spirit, but they were waiting for those 10 days for the Helper to come, for the power of the Holy Spirit to fall upon them, for the fire of the Holy Spirit to fall upon them.  Just like John the Baptist said, I baptize you with water, but there's one coming that's gonna baptize you with the fire of the , the fire of the Holy Spirit, and I'm paraphrasing.  As believers in Yeshua and Jesus, we want more fire and more fire, because only Yeshua has enough fire.  But as we are in the sanctification process, as we're waiting for His second coming, we wanna seek more fire, more manna, more of His revelation, and that's how we celebrate the Feast of Shavuot, the Feast of Pentecost, by asking God to fill us up with the Ruach HaKodesh, with the Holy Spirit, and enable us to run the race as ambassadors, as priests, make it to the end, and go home.  May the Lord Yeshua, Jesus, bless you this Shavuot Pentecost season, as we are all priests, because Yeshua, Jesus, is the High Priest, and therefore we inherit the blessing from the high priest, Numbers chapter 6, verse 24 to 26.  May the Lord bless you, and may the Lord keep you.  May the Lord make his face shine upon you, and be gracious to you.  May the Lord lift up his countenance upon you, and give you his peace.  Yivarechecha Adonai v'ishmarecha.  Ya'er Adonai panavelecha v'ichunecha.  Yissa Adonai panah ve'lecha, ve'yasem lecha shalom.  Beshem Yeshua HaMashiach, in the name of Yeshua the Messiah.  Amen.  I'm Messianic Rabbi Zev Porat, sending you blessings from Jerusalem, Israel, in the mighty name of the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, Al Yehuda, the Lion of the Tribe of Judah, Jesus Yeshua.  Amen.  Happy Shavuot.  Feast of Pentecost, and may the indwelling of the fire of the Holy Spirit be upon you.  Shalom. ",
