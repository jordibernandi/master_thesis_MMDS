            "text": "As I reported last night, Turkey has thrown open their borders and they have given economic migrants a green light to attempt to make illegal crossings into Europe.  Buses are even transporting people from Istanbul to the border of Greece and Bulgaria.  Turkey is now waging demographic warfare against Europe.  This is being used by Turkey as an attempt to extort European support for its military ambitions in the Middle East.  Right now, Turkey is engaged in combat all across northern Syria.  They are sponsoring hardcore Salafist groups that are widely recognized as terrorists by the international community.  They are also sponsoring militant Turkic ethno-nationalist groups like the Grey Wolves.  A very large percentage of these militants are foreigners and not native Syrians.  NATO just issued a press release expressing solidarity with Turkey, but they are refusing to get involved.  They say they will only take action to protect Turkish airspace, but will not intervene directly in Turkish combat operations in Syria.  Meanwhile, economic migrants are trying to bum-rush the Greek and Bulgarian borders, as well as several Greek islands.  Turkey keeps calling these people terrorists.  Syrian refugees, according to mainline media such as the German government-run Deutsche Welle, the people currently attempting illegal crossings hail from all over the world.  Mainline European media admits that the people currently attempting illegal entry include people from Iraq, Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan, North Africa, and Sub-Saharan Africa.  Of course, it has also been well established over the years that people who enter Europe illegally routinely lie about being from Syria.  Bulgaria just announced that they are sending 1,000 soldiers to their border with Turkey.  Greece is also beefing up their land border with Turkey.  The Greek Coast Guard says they are working at their absolute best highest capacity to prevent crossings by sea.  However, hundreds of economic migrants have successfully reached Lesbos and Zamos over the past 12 hours.  Alright, thanks for watching this video.
