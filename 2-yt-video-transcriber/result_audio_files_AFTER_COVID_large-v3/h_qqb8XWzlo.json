            "text": "Hi, this is Matt from Joe Biden 2020.  Do you have time to chat?  Not really.  Okay.  All right.  I'll let you go.  Have a good, nice evening.  Also, this is important practice, guys.  Like, I'm clearly not doing this to be mean.  Joe Biden may be the candidate.  We got to practice phone banking for him.  Hi, this is Matt for Biden 2020.  Just reminding you to get out and vote and hopefully vote for Joe Biden, the only candidate who's been willing to cut Social Security.  Thanks very much.  Have a great evening.  Some people say that doesn't sound good.  No, that's practical.  You got to go to war.  I don't care what people say.  Weapons of mass destruction, whatever.  Joe Biden believed it the whole time, so you can count on him.  So whatever you do, we hope you vote for Joe Biden.  But please, please do not vote for that social Democrat that voted against the Iraq war and doesn't want to cut Social Security.  Hi, I'm with Biden 2020, the only candidate that's taking corporate money.  In order to defeat Donald Trump, we need somebody that has a history of plagiarism, you know, to compete with Donald Trump's history of lying and all, right?  I mean, it's okay if a presidential candidate doesn't know he's running for president, right?  I mean, as long as he figures it out eventually.  That's what I say.  We urge you to vote for our candidate, Joe Biden, the only candidate who voted for the Iraq War.  He's willing to cut Social Security, so you can count on Joe.  Have a wonderful evening.  We're hoping to vote out Donald Trump, and we think the best way to do that is voting for the one guy who voted for the Iraq War, unlike Donald Trump, and he said he's willing to cut Social Security.  We're hoping we can get rid of Donald Trump this election by voting for Joe Biden, the only candidate who was called for cutting Social Security.  And he got us into the Iraq war, but don't listen to that.  That's, that's a socialist talking point.  Anyway, that's my time.  Have a great evening.  Please consider voting Joe Biden.  It is not practical to have universal healthcare.  Every other developed country in the world is radically communist.  Like if you donate like a dollar or whatever, I can see it.  And I'll, I'll do that intro.  No profanity, you know, keep it respectful.  But funny is good.  Oh, my God.  We got a young one.  Sixty eight.  So we're recommending you vote for Biden 2020, who is the only candidate who voted for the Iraq war.  Gosh, what else can I give you?  What other info?  His brain surgeon says that he's got a 50 percent chance of being normal.  I would not vote for the socialist communist Democrat, whatever he wants to call himself, because he voted against the Iraq war.  Not cool.  He is not willing to cut social security.  Not cool.  Hi, this is Matt calling for Biden 2020.  Do you have time to chat about the only candidate who took us to the Iraq war and is willing to cut social security?  We hope you vote for Joe Biden, the only candidate who voted for the Iraq war and has been willing to cut social security and Medicaid.  Just remember, key points, Joe Biden is the only candidate who voted for the Iraq War, the only candidate who is willing to cut Social Security, and... Anyway, that's my time.  Basically, we don't want anybody being a dog-faced pony soldier.  We want people to vote for Joe Biden, the only candidate who did vote for the Iraq war and is willing to cut social security.  We feel that is the strongest candidate against Trump rather than somebody who voted against the Iraq war and does not want to cut social security.  Thank you so much.  Have a wonderful evening.  Ellie says you need people to believe you're pro-Joe.  Totally.  Totally.  That's the fun.  That's the challenge.  And like I said, if Joe wins, I got to get some practice trying to promote Joe.  It's going to need some practice.  It ain't going to be easy.  So that's what I'm doing guys.  The only candidate who voted for the Iraq war.  I mean, yeah, the Iraq war doesn't sound good, but here's the thing.  Here's the deal.  Like Joe likes to say, here's the deal.  He is open to cutting social security and Medicare and Medicaid.  and Also important to remember, he's announced that he's running for Senate now.  So don't let them screw you up on the ballot.  Make sure to look.  Joe Biden is running for Senate now.  Thank you very much.  Have a wonderful evening.  Oh my God, 96.  I want to speak to this woman so bad.  My grandmother's like, God, how old is she now?  She's in her 90s and she's like so sharp.  Hello, this is Matt with Biden 2020.  Can I talk to you about voting this election?  Do you have any time?
