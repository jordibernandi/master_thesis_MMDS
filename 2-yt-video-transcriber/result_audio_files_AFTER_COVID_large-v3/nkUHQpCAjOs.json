            "text": "Nor is it going to fix the state election law problems.  I see Pennsylvania has asked, hey, can we count our ballots three days after the election?  You're going to have this sort of thing going on in one state court after another, in battleground state after battleground state, which is exactly why Biden has hired 600 lawyers or has 600 lawyer volunteers to litigate this.  They are prepared to litigate this, which is exactly why.  Tell me if you agree or not, seriously.  And that is why Pelosi, the Democrats in the media are trying to position this.  as a Trump failure.  That is, he's in charge of the post office, but he's not in charge of the states and the electoral processes.  Under the Constitution, that's the states.  Well, he's in charge of the post office.  Well, didn't all the unions just endorse Biden for president of the United States?  Well, he's in charge of the post office.  You know, they're moving mailboxes and all the rest of it.  So, again... If the Democrats come up short on Election Day, they're going to go in court.  They're going to blame Trump.  They're going to blame the post office.  They're never going to blame their governors.  And if they think they've won, they're going to accuse Trump of refusing to leave office.  Is that the game plan here? ",

            "text": "yeah i think they are uh... setting everything up to gain the system and again uh... you can look at the new york primary to see you to see you at how they're going to do that because remember they're the ones who pushed for trying to have as many ballots cast by mail as possible.  they then get a high rejection rate which is normal with absentee ballots.  the rejection rate unfortunately with them is about twice that of votes cast in a precinct.  so now they are in court.  there's litigation going on in new york in which they are telling and asking judges.  in fact they've gotten an order from a judge ordering election officials to count the rejected ballots.  So, in other words, they're in court trying to convince a judge, which they have done, to count absentee ballots which were rejected.  And the rejections are everything from signatures not matching, which indicates it might not have actually been submitted by that particular voter.  It might be a fraudulent voter, to it not matching the requirements or meeting the requirements of state law, which means it probably actually is an ineligible voter or an ineligible ballot.  And yet now they're going to count them and basically override state laws on that.  I think you're going to see that kind of gamesmanship going on all over the country and claims that, well, if you're not counting these ballots that were rejected... You're engaging in discriminatory conduct and trying to keep people from voting, even though that's obviously not the case. ",

            "text": "This will make the litigation in Bush versus Gore look ridiculously simple, where we really had a few counties and one state.  The Democrats have decided to push this into all these states and all these counties.  They'd like to do it nationwide.  And then you're exactly right.  If you don't go along, they say you're suppressing the vote.  You don't want every vote to count.  And you're right, they game the system.  My concern here is this.  When I went back and I looked at the Supreme Court recently on a number of these election law cases, whether it's Citizens United or whatever it is related to election law, we have five to four votes going on in that court.  Five to four votes.  And my concern is the Chief Justice may well Flip with the Democrat activists on the court.  And then after that, Congress can step in.  And this could be completely unprecedented, any constitutional crisis.  Again, I don't want to get into the weeds with this.  Maybe one day I will.  But they're going to be duking it out as they meet together, counting Electoral College votes.  And you can only imagine what that's going to look like when you have congressmen and senators all gathered together fighting over what just took place in the states.  Wouldn't this be a disastrous constitutional mess? ",

We could have huge delays all over the country, particularly if there's litigation going on contesting the results.  And you know there have been, Mark, I couldn't believe it, there have been upwards of a hundred and fifty lawsuits filed this year, an unprecedented number, almost all by liberals, trying to change the rules governing elections, including things, by the way, of trying to get rid of the security protocols governing absentee or mail-in ballots, saying you shouldn't have to have a witness signature on your ballot and other things like that.  So if we can imagine litigation going on all over the country after November, big long delays in counting the ballots it's possible that for the first time in our history week we could get to january twentieth and not know the outcome of the election because of the litigation going on all over the country and i i'm not sure a lot of people know this mark but there's actually a federal statute that says that if the outcome of the action has not been determined by january twentieth which is the end of the president's term the acting president will become the speaker of the united states house of representatives.

You can see what they've done to our political dialogue.  You can see how they operate through the media and Hollywood and our universities.  So what the hell?  Destroy another institution.  The president of the United States is the Thomas Paine on this issue.  He's telling the American people what's going to happen, certainly what might happen, and the Democrats have no problem with it, and they're going to try and blame him. ",
