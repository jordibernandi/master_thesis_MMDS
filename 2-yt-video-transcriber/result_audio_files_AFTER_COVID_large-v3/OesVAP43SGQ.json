            "text": "Oh.  Lauren Daigle has had a few questionable moments over the past couple of years.  If you don't know who Lauren Daigle is, she's a so-called Christian artist, but these days the title Christian artist seems to be more and more questionable.  Is she a Christian artist like Snoop Dogg?  Or maybe a Christian artist like Kanye West?  Maybe she's a Christian artist like John Steingard who now no longer believes in God?  While no one but God knows who of us are truly saved, we can look at the fruit of a person's life and examine what their beliefs are in comparison to what the Bible says.  Back in 2018, she seemed to be confused on this topic.  She says, I can't say one way or the other.  I'm not God.  And her rationale for this is that there are people she loves that embrace this lifestyle so she can't say if it's actually a sin.  That's like you or I saying that we love people that are thieves, so I don't know if stealing is a sin.  I mean, I have friends who are murderers and I really care about them, so I'm not really sure I can say that's a sin.  Let's clear some things up here.  If God has said that something is a sin, then it's a sin.  There is no wiggle room.  So, let's fast forward a year later and now she has issues with being called a Christian artist.  She just wants to be called an artist.  Well, hey, why even be called a Christian then?  Just be a God believer.  Being labeled a Christian is what identifies someone as a follower of Jesus.  So, now it's a year later and she's speaking highly of Kanye West and Billie Eilish.  Now, if you don't know who Billie Eilish is, just think of Marilyn Manson, but female.  This is Billie.  So you can see, she portrays a pleasant image that any Christian artist would stand behind.  This is her at the 2019 awards, performing her hit, All the Good Girls Go to Hell.  And here's her in the actual video.  But hey, surely the song lyrics can't be as bad as the images.  my lucifer is lonely folks.  this woman is a servant of satan can't commit to anything but a crime.  she'll want the devil on her team.  my lucifer is lonely.  so now that we know who billy is let's go back to the article.  she goes through her at home with playlist saying that she thrives on connecting with people like kanye west and billy eilish.  she talks about kanye but also says that billy eilish is on her list.  Billie revealed that as a child she was very religious despite not being raised to believe in God.  So what was the religion she was very religious about if she wasn't being raised to believe in God?  We can only assume a godless religion.  And now she's open to pretty much every belief, including Satanism it would appear.  She continues to talk about Eilish and her music producer Phineas, giving billy the lonely lucifer singer praise as well as phineas's talents.  folks this is dangerous.  this is the enemy hard at work.  it all starts with someone claiming to love god and singing worship to him.  then deceit slips in in the form of questioning what god says is sin.  Then the title of Christian is removed from who you prefer to be addressed at.  And then the encouragement of a worldly and evil promoting singer comes to the surface.  Seriously, what's next?  What I do know is that scripture is clear that there is no unity of righteousness and lawlessness, that light and dark have nothing in common, and that we share nothing with unbelievers, except the truth of the gospel, of course.  As mentioned before, only God knows who are truly His, but when we see very questionable statements and endorsements coming from so-called Christians, we have every right to be concerned.  As always, leave your thoughts and comments below, and until next time, take care and God bless. ",
