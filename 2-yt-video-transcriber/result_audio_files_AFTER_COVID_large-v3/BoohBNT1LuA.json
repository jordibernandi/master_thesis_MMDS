            "text": "That is a community watch coming to you from the city of San Diego.  We're about to do this juvenile detention center, juvenile court.  I'm here by myself in the city of San Diego.  Beautiful day.  See how they feel about the camera.  I'll go around to the court and come back.  It's true in our court.  It's true in our probation.  so so I don't know you, man.  I'm not going to answer you.  Checking on my employee vehicles.  Yeah.  You don't know.  you guys get paid by tax dollars.  Our tax dollars, right?  This is our property.  We have someone practicing the First Amendment.  Hurry up.  We got someone practicing the First Amendment.  I'm just private security, my man.  I know, but if this is a lawful act, you ain't got no business even bothering me.  What's your name?  I'm just making sure everything's cool, man.  What's wrong with the camera?  I just want to know, you know, it makes people, it makes officers a little nervous out here when people are taking pictures.  They shouldn't be such pussies then.  That would be a pussy, bro, if you're somebody's afraid of it.  If you're a man and you're afraid of somebody taking a picture of your car.  I'm sorry, but you're afraid.  We're taking pictures of private citizens' vehicles over here.  That's all I'm saying.  Private citizens in a public parking lot?  Yeah, I mean, these are... It's a public parking lot.  These are just regular people coming to go to court.  You know why the license plates are displayed publicly, right?  So they can be seen?  I ain't going to talk to nobody.  Get a cop so they can educate you.  Should I just say hello?  Good morning.  How are you doing, sir?  Hey, how's it going?  Security guards right to my left.  I'm going to come back just to make sure.  Hi, Kurt.  Hello, sir.  Hi.  Can we help you?  I didn't ask anybody for help.  No, I know, but what are you taking pictures of, sir?  My employees and my employees' cars.  Your employees and your employees' cars.  Okay.  You guys are public servants, right?  Absolutely, sir.  That's what I'm doing.  Can I have your name?  Can I get your name?  Absolutely.  Supervisor Jessica Medina.  No, you may not have my name.  Is there something that we can help you with?  Yeah, you can stop bothering me.  That's it.  We're trying to help.  Sir, I don't see you.  What are you offering?  Because the waitress, when they ask for help, they offer something.  What are you offering?  I just need to know.  I would like to know if there's anything that you need help with, if we can help you with anything today.  I didn't ask anybody.  What's your name?  You don't have no jurisdiction over me.  I'm not going to give you my name unless I commit a crime.  This is the First Amendment protected activity.  I asked you to leave me alone.  Let's see how rude you keep being.  All right.  Well, kick rocks then.  No one needs you here.  I already told you I don't need you.  Yeah, but your tone with her is very confrontational.  Fuck you.  I can say whatever I want.  Free speech, man.  Sure, of course you can.  You're going to put it on YouTube.  All right, so you should shut your mouth.  Now you're going to be a YouTube star.  Just like you don't.  I don't need to either, sir.  Really?  Your duties don't come before your rights when you're being paid?  You know what I mean?  She's demanding my name.  How is that respectful?  I'm asking.  She's asking.  I'm asking.  And I told you no, and you keep asking, so you're demanding.  Well, I'm allowed to keep asking a question.  I'm allowed to tell you to fuck off, too.  Okay.  Me?  Why?  I'm not angry.  I just don't like being bothered.  I already told her I don't need help, and she keeps insisting.  So just shut your mouth and keep going, man.  You're just a probation officer.  You can make it as a cop, so leave me alone, man.  Why are you here today, sir?  Because I'm free.  Why are you here?  Because you're employed by us?  I didn't even say that.  I already knew that.  You guys sound stupid.  I'm 53 years old.  If I needed help, I would have came and asked you.  You came and told me.  I told you I don't need it, but you keep insisting because you're trying to get my name.  Because you want to try to hit me up for something or run my name or whatever?  Not at all.  You guys can all go.  Look, all this money is just being wasted.  Over a First Amendment protected activity, all this.  If this is how they feel, then the terrorists already won, guys.  Is it a lawful?  We're not worried about every day.  Is it a lawful occurrence?  If it's a lawful occurrence, you have no business bothering anybody.  You're law enforcement.  If there's no law being broken, you have no business.  I already told you I didn't want to have a conversation six minutes ago, and you keep on, keep on.  He didn't see that part when you came and asked and I was polite and I said, no, I don't need no help.  Well, just keep you company while you're taking pictures.  Make sure nothing happens to you while you're here in the parking lot.  Nice.  I'll be real more stupid.  The only ones that I'm a threat by is by you guys.  So as soon as you guys leave for sure, nothing will happen.  Yeah, you do.  You guys are all armed.  I'm surrounded by armed people.  Of course I'm threatened.  Go back to work, Ms.  Medina.  Get your ass back to work, Ms.  Medina.  No, sir.  You serve the public.  They don't pay you to just stand out here.  You're right.  I am.  You know what?  We'll see.  They'll tell you to go back.  I'm going to stay until you go back.  How's that?  Okay.  As soon as you leave.  Exactly.  You know what?  Let me go live, as a matter of fact.  I thought you were live.  No.  Would you talk to me without your fucking vaginal uniform like that?  No, you wouldn't, motherfucker.  And you know you wouldn't.  That's why you just fucking looked at the ground when you said you would.  All you guys, fucking all you guys.  I asked you guys to leave me alone, and you guys still keep bothering me.  I'm just talking to you.  I'm trying to help you.  I don't want you to be appropriate.  You seem very upset.  I'm very concerned.  What about you?  That's not stupid, man.  I don't need to listen to you.  You need to listen to me.  I don't work for you.  You work for me.  See, that's the way it works.  See, you think you came out here, you were going to just exhort your... Listen, no, no.  You listen.  You thought you were going to come out here and exhort your authority by asking me five times what my name was when I told you I'm not going to give you my name.  Now you're being rude.  See, so that's what you get what you give.  When you came up, I was respectful.  I told you I didn't need no help.  And you keep on and you keep on.  one question leads to another because that's how law enforcement is.  That's how you're trained, like a robot.  Yeah, this is my place.  You guys work for us.  We pay for this.  I don't understand.  Okay.  Okay.  Listen, money 101.  Okay.  Money 101.  Okay.  Since you're so smart, we give you money.  You pay taxes off that money.  We pay taxes for you.  That's how money, think about it.  It's money 101.  If you're giving money and then you pay taxes off of that money that's given to you, we're paying taxes.  Yes.  You get your taxes back every week, ma'am.  Yes, sweetheart.  You're very misinformed, sweetheart.  You're very misinformed.  I'm No, because you're getting paid by the community.  Your money derives from the community.  My money doesn't derive from the community.  I pay my taxes off of my hard work.  You need to kick rocks and leave me alone.  It doesn't come out of nothing.  I don't give a fuck.  I don't want to hear it.  I don't want to hear it.  I don't want to hear it.  No, you're not.  You're working.  Is this part of your job description?  I know, but are you allowed to be here?  I don't have to fucking listen to you, okay?  No point at me.  I'm trying to help.  You're allowed to be here.  So then why would you leave me alone?  I would have already been gone.  This is getting that way.  She made it that way because she came up and about five times asked me and I kept telling her, no, I don't need no help.  I wasn't here, but I'm trying to like, person to person, we're all humans.  You're allowed to be here.  So then why am I being bothered?  So why am I being bothered?  I don't know.  I wasn't here.  Well, see, that's the question.  Why am I being bothered if I'm not bothering nobody?  I guess I'll just go around and get license plates and everything else I can.  Since you want to be... I'll be free.  Ain't nobody gonna stifle my freedom.  And I'm not angry.  You guys just don't know how to deal with it.  Someone tells you to fuck off.  You too, man.  You too.  Dish Network called and want their satellites back.  I said Dish Network called.  They want their satellites back.  I'm not grumpy, bro.  I'm free.  I'm free.  That's proof that he doesn't think I'm a threat.  That's proof that he doesn't think I'm a threat.  Go get educated, please.  She's going to go make a phone call.  I got three people asking if I need help.  Tell them, no, I'm fine.  You got to act stupid.  Freedom scares the bad guys.  Camera scares the bad guys.  all that, I'm still going to keep doing what I'm doing, man.  It's ridiculous.  This is the freedom in our country.  Everybody's snitching on everybody over a camera.  ... Look at him, look at him.  Still getting the walk of shame?  Walk of shame?  Lesson was free today, okay?  Alright, lesson was free today.  Appreciate you guys.  That is a community watch.  I am out. ",
