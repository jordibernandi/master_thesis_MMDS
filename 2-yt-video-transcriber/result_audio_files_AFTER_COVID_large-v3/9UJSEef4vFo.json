I will qualify for what I said.  Because guess what?  Donald Trump, Mike Pence, and a Senate majority right now can determine that what you say is hate speech.  I will qualify for a second.  I don't agree with that.  I'm not okay with anyone removing your rights.  I'm not okay with anyone stepping in and saying, you don't have the right to believe what you believe, or speak freely, but you're okay with someone walking in and telling someone what they can and can't say.  That's terrifying.  I'm surprised, that's when you said you're a PhD candidate, so you're obviously a very smart person.
