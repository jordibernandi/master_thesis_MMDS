            "text": "Here's something about me.  I bet most of you didn't know.  Star Trek Voyager is not my favorite Star Trek show.  In fact, it's my least favorite.  I just wanted to get that out in the open right at the beginning, because it is relevant to the topic of this video, and I hardly ever mention it.  The thing is, lots of my fellow Star Trek fans like Voyager more than I do.  Some like it a whole lot more.  Some folks might even say it's their favorite Star Trek show.  Hi, Meredith.  How you doing?  Knowing that other people view the show differently than I do hasn't changed my opinion of Voyager overall, but it has encouraged me from time to time to go back and reevaluate it, to give certain episodes \u2014 episodes for which I've carried a particular dislike, perhaps a second look.  I did that recently, in fact.  I watched a Voyager episode I used to think was just a pointless waste of time, and by the end, my thoughts about that episode were very different than they were before.  I noticed things I hadn't before.  I saw the episode in a new light.  And I wanted to talk about that with you, because it's my job that I gave myself, and for which you pay me.  The episode I'm referring to is from Voyager's third season, and it's titled Real Life.  In this episode, the holographic doctor creates a family for himself on the holodeck.  He explains to B'Elanna that he's heard the members of the crew talk about their families so much that he figured he'd find out firsthand.  B'Elanna and Kes are like, you have a family?  We want to meet them.  Come on, let us meet your family.  So the doctor has B'Elanna and Kes over to his holodeck house for dinner that night.  Within a few minutes it becomes obvious that the only research the doctor did for this program was watching A Date With Your Family, and B'Elanna gets fed up and freezes the program.  And the doctor is like, what, you don't like my family?  And B'Elanna is like, this isn't a family.  You have no idea what family is about.  Family isn't about unconditional love and support and encouragement.  It's about guilt and disappointment and emotional manipulation and obligation \u2014 people you don't want to spend time with, but you have to, because if you don't, that makes you a bad person for some reason.  Can you explain that to me, Doctor?  Is that in your medical database, you smug piece of shit?  B'Elanna tells the Doctor that she thinks his basic idea is a good one, he just needs to tweak his program to make it a little more realistic.  So the Doctor lets B'Elanna add some randomized algorithms to make his family members less perfect and the program more unpredictable.  When the doctor returns home that night, things are a little different.  His wife, Charlene, now has a job speaking at the Bolian embassy and has to rush out.  His son, Jeffrey, is teeming out hardcore, playing loud music, hanging out with Klingons.  His daughter, Belle, is late for practice with her Parisi Squares team and can't find her ion mallet and kinda freaking out about it.  And the doctor's like, I'm kinda over this family thing now.  But the doctor doesn't give up, cause he ain't beaten.  He hands out a leaflet and calls a meet and talks it over.  Anybody?  Pete Seeger?  The Almanac Singers?  Well, I guess some references are just for me, then.  Anyway, the Doctor calls a meeting and tells his family that he's taken it upon himself to rearrange their lives so that everything works better for him.  Them.  For them, is what he means.  For them to think.  He's changed Charlene's lecture schedule, declared that Jeffrey can no longer have Klingon friends, and told Belle she has to move to the second team in Parisi Squares, even though she's good enough to be on the first team, because she's too young.  The family doesn't care for any of that.  Charlene reminds the doctor that she's not one of the children and needs to have a say in stuff like this.  Jeffrey's all like, you can't decide who I'm friends with, and teen's right the hell out of there.  And Belle, who is the last member of the family after the others have exited, still wants to know why she has to be stuck on second team with the chumps instead of kicking ass on the varsity like a champ.  The doctor says, look, I know you don't understand, but you're too young, you'd be playing with kids who are older than you, you just don't realize how dangerous it is.  You're my kid.  I'm just looking out for you.  And Bella's like, okay, fine, I'll play on the second team.  And the doctor's like, well, it was never up to you, but I appreciate you being agreeable about it.  I bet he also appreciates her not calling him out for how racist he's being toward Jeffrey's Klingon friends.  Although, since she doesn't call him out on it, that means I've got to call the writers out on how ridiculously problematic it is to portray Jeffrey's Klingon friends as violent juvenile delinquents.  Not that it's anything new \u2014 there's been a streak of racial essentialism running through Star Trek from the very beginning, which simplifies the task of writing allegories where alien races represent different countries, cultures, or aspects of human nature.  I get it, but it's still kinda icky, especially when it leads to something like this, where the problem with how the Doctor reacts to Jeffrey's friends is that he's being too controlling of his son.  Not that he's being super racist against Klingons, or that the writers are portraying the Klingons in such a stereotypical way in the first place.  But I digress.  We spend a few minutes of the episode following a subplot about a mysterious spatial anomaly that nobody cares about and is mostly there to pad out the running time and give the rest of the cast something to do.  Then the Doctor catches Jeffrey hanging out with those damn punk Klingons, and it turns out he's planning to take part in a Klingon rite that involves attacking someone with a knife and drawing blood to show that he's prepared to become a warrior.  The doctor's like, like heckfire.  you are, not under my roof, young man!  Now you boys get outta here and take your dagger with ya, ya filthy barbarians!  And on the way out, one of the Klingons says to the other, see, I told ya humans are weak and cowardly.  Oh, so they're prejudiced against us, too!  That makes it okay!  Except that's not how racism works!  The doctor and Jeffrey fight for a bit, but then they're interrupted by a message from Charlene informing them that Bell's had an accident, and it sounds serious.  So we cut to the hospital, and it's several hours later, and the doctor and another doctor have operated on Bell for hours, but it's done no good.  She hit her head on the Parisi Squares court and suffered a serious brain injury.  The brain hemorrhaging can't be stopped.  The kid is toast.  Charlene and Jeffrey leave, and Belle wakes up and has a scene with the doctor straight out of the most maudlin melodrama you ever saw, where she asks, how come everything's so blurry?  Why can't she feel her legs?  Daddy, am I ever gonna get better?  Will I ever see again?  The doctor's like, I'm out, and he ends the holodeck program.  Later, the doctor's in sickbay, tending to Tom Paris, who was injured in that subplot that nobody cares about, and Tom's like, oh, hey, how's the family?  And the doctor says, oh, you know, my daughter had an accident, she's gonna die, it's whatever.  I decided to just turn off the program and not go back.  And Tom tells him, you created that program so you could experience what it's like to have a family.  And pain and loss are a part of that.  The rest of us don't have the option to just turn it off when things get too difficult.  We have to take the bad with the good.  If you end the program now, you won't be able to be there for your wife and son during their grief, and they won't be able to be there for you.  You'll miss the whole point of having a family.  And the doctor's like, all right, fine, I'll go back and watch my daughter die.  Jesus.  And he goes back into the program, and he comforts Belle, and she dies with the doctor and Charlene and Jeffrey at her bedside.  Thanks for watching Star Trek Voyager, folks!  Join us next week when the crew meets aliens evolved from dinosaurs!  So, I won't tell you that I used to hate this episode, because that would be silly and untrue, but I used to regard this episode as mostly a waste of time.  The main premise of the show, that the Doctor creates a holodeck family and discovers that he'll never truly understand what having a real family is like until he experiences conflict and pain and loss, is solid, if somewhat basic.  But as with many, many other installments of Voyager, it's a premise that is left with a lot of unexplored potential.  For example, yeah, the Doctor accepts that his initial version of the family is too perfect, and that in order to get a sense of what actual family life is like, he has to make his wife and children more unpredictable, more independent.  less mindlessly agreeable, and just generally more, you know, human.  But just as with the bit about real life requiring us to deal with pain and other difficult experiences, that's a fairly rudimentary insight.  What about the fact that the Doctor creates his family literally to be an extension of himself?  He initially doesn't seem all that interested in his wife and children as individuals unto themselves.  He sees them as props, as supporting players in his life, there to support and enrich him.  You know, kinda like how traditional gender roles have conditioned men to view their families for generations.  That angle is right there, and the episode does virtually nothing with it.  Even the Doctor's ultimate decision to go back and experience the death of his daughter isn't really about being there for her or the rest of his family, though Tom does at least mention the importance of that.  It's about the doctor challenging himself to have the most authentic experience of a family that he can, even though it means going through something extremely painful.  It's all about him learning something.  But the story doesn't allow him to learn arguably the most valuable lesson a person in his position can learn \u2014 that his family doesn't exist only to love and support him, but rather so that all of them can love and support each other.  And, that being the case, traditional attitudes that place the father at the head of the family and position the others as servants are harmful to everyone, including fathers, and ought to be discarded.  Not what the episode's about, though.  In fact, while the Doctor's understanding of what a family is and what the experience of having one includes does expand from the beginning of the episode to the end, the Doctor's behavior toward his family doesn't really change at all.  Once they're reprogrammed to be less Stepford-y, the Doctor approaches their conflict as a puzzle that he can solve by simply finding the right way to rearrange the pieces, and he never really moves beyond that.  When he takes it upon himself to rearrange their schedules to his liking and justifies it by saying everyone has to make sacrifices, his son is at least sharp enough to ask, What sacrifices are you making, Dad?  But that never really goes anywhere.  The Doctor's father-son standoff with Jeffrey over his Klingon friends is the only family conflict that gets any significant screen time, but right as it's coming to a head, Belle has her accident, and the episode shifts focus to her tear-jerking deathbed vigil.  And that's the bit that never really landed with me when I watched this episode previously, because the episode clearly wants us to have empathy for the Doctor, to share in his grief.  The show fades to black on the image of the heartbroken family embracing each other in the moments after Belle has died.  We're clearly supposed to feel something.  And why shouldn't we?  Few experiences outside of being a Baltimore Orioles fan are as crushing as the death of a child.  But see, that was always my problem with that scene, and with this episode on the whole.  Bell isn't a child.  The Doctor's family members aren't real people \u2014 they're holodeck programs.  And yes, it's true that we've seen examples of holodeck programs who have grown beyond their initial programming and attained sentience \u2014 the Doctor himself being the leading example, along with Vic Fontaine on DS9 and Professor Moriarty from TNG.  But we're shown no indication that the doctor's family falls into that category.  Their behavior changes because B'Elanna alters their programming, not because they grow and mature naturally as a result of their experiences.  And they exhibit no signs of genuine self-awareness.  They're fictional characters.  Does this episode really expect me to be this upset over the death of someone who, within the fiction of the show I'm watching, is a fictional character?  What's interesting is, that problem is what led to me seeing the episode in a new way and gaining an appreciation for it I didn't have before.  Rewatching Real Life recently, I felt like I understood what the Doctor was feeling in those final scenes at Belle's deathbed better than I had when I watched the episode previously.  I thought about it \u2014 for a few days, actually \u2014 but I couldn't quite put my finger on what it was.  Then it finally clicked.  after I watched an episode of another show.  When I was a teenager in the 1990s, there were a handful of shows that I never missed.  TNG and DS9 were in there, Voyager not so much, but I mostly kept up with it for most of the run anyway, The X-Files, Lois and Clark, Law and Order, Original Recipe \u2014 I never really got into any of the spinoffs \u2014 Homicide, Life on the Street, and, perhaps most of all, NYPD Blue, one of my very favorite TV shows ever.  I rewatched all of NYPD Blue last year for the first time in a while, planning on doing a series of videos about it that I mapped out but haven't actually gotten around to doing.  I'm busy, okay?  And the show has certain problems, but as drama, as a showcase for writing and acting, it holds up exceptionally well.  And, like many of my fellow NYPD Blue fans, I consider seasons two through five to be the series' creative peak.  Those are the seasons when the show's remarkable ensemble of actors was led by Jimmy Smits, who played Detective Bobby Simone.  After the fifth season, Jimmy Smits announced he was leaving the show, and the producers arranged to write his character off early in season six.  Spoiler alert for NYPD Blue, by the way.  It feels weird to preface a discussion about one of the most well-known episodes of one of the defining shows of American television in the 90s with a spoiler warning, but I know not everybody's seen it or heard about it, so consider this a heads-up.  Because, when I say that the producers wrote Jimmy Smits' character off, what I mean is, they killed him.  During the course of the first five episodes of NYPD Blue's sixth season, Bobby Simone develops an infection which spreads to his heart, causing congestive heart failure, which leads to him getting a heart transplant, which doesn't work, and ultimately he dies.  It's riveting, it's beautiful, and it's absolutely wrenching.  I cried when I watched it for the first time when I was eighteen.  I cried when I watched it again in reruns several years later.  And I cried when I watched it last year.  It is devastating.  As devastating as the death of a real person?  No, not even close.  My grandmother died earlier this year, and I'd rather watch Bobby Simone's death a hundred times than have to go through losing Granny again.  But that's not my point.  My point is, even though I know Bobby Simone isn't a real person, even though I know what I'm watching is fictional, it still affects me emotionally.  I still feel sadness over the death of this character.  And the death of Bobby on NYPD Blue is not the only example of this I can point to from my own experience.  I recently did a whole video about the episodes and scenes in Star Trek that break my heart.  The obvious reference to make within that context is the death of Spock at the end of Star Trek II.  That one still gets to me, even though I know that not only is Spock a fictional character, he comes back to life in the very next movie!  Outside of Star Trek, another recent example is Avengers Endgame.  There are several moments in that film that get me choked up.  Avengers assemble, and I am Iron Man?  The parting shot of Steve dancing contentedly with Peggy?  When I thought of all that, and I connected it to Voyager's real life, I realized that I knew exactly where the Doctor is coming from in that final scene.  It doesn't matter that Belle isn't a real person.  In that moment, in that holodeck program, she's real to him.  And he's moved by her death for the same reason.  I'm moved by the death of Bobby Simone \u2014 because he has empathy, because he's emotionally invested in her, because he cares about what happens to her, and because he's going to miss her.  I don't grieve for Belle the same way the Doctor does, because I don't get to know her the way he does.  I only see a few scenes of her in the episode, but within the fiction of that episode, the Doctor spends hours living inside that holodeck program.  getting attached to those characters, the same way we get attached to our favorite characters on TV shows and movies, or in books.  Think of a movie you've seen or a book you've read that has profoundly moved you, really made you feel something for its characters, despite the fact that you've only spent a few hours with them.  Now imagine how much greater that feeling would be if, instead of watching or reading, you were in a holodeck program, immersed in the world of those characters, living their lives alongside them, interacting with them as though they were real, as though you were a part of their lives.  When I look at it that way \u2014 and, to be clear, I don't think it's the way the creators of the show intended for me to look at it, but It ain't like they can stop me.  The Doctor's anguish over the death of Belle makes perfect sense, and I empathize with him very strongly, because from that perspective, it's not about the death of a child who doesn't actually exist.  It's about the way art can touch us, break our hearts, and inspire our empathy.  Hopefully that's something all of you can relate to, because it's a beautiful thing. ",
