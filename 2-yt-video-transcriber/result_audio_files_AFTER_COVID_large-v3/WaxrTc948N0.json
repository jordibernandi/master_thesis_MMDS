            "text": "And God sits back watching and maneuvering to make sure that it all fits his own plan.  Russia was financed by the international bankers of Europe and America.  Trotsky and Lenin got their training and their money right here in America.  Lenin left America with six million dollars in gold financed by those same international bankers to go back to Russia to begin what is called the Bolshevik Revolution that brought the Communists into power.  Let's talk.  I ain't got time to tell it all, but I'm going to tell enough of it and then you can go and find the rest.  All of it is written in a book, but you better become readers now.  Your very life depends on your willingness to read.  The international bankers have always wanted what they call a balance of power in the world.  Let's talk, let's talk.  As I told you, at our Savior's Day message, which if you don't have it, be sure to get it.  It's part one of this subject.  The Wahlbergs, the Rothschilds, who financed Hitler, German Jews financed Hitler.  Right here in America, Loeb and Kuhn and Jacob Schiff, international bankers financed Hitler.  And poor Jews died while big Jews were at the root of what you call the Holocaust.  Why don't you tell that man?  You can't write this.  Go back and tell your editor, I want to put this in the paper tomorrow.  You've got a hell of a nerve to open your mouth to call me an anti-Semite when your own people have been the worst anti-Semites in the world.  Oh, sit down in your seat.  We ain't going nowhere for a while.  We're going to tarry here till we get the Holy Ghost.  What do they mean, balance of power?  This is how the international bankers get their money back from governments whom they have loaned money to.  They manipulate your sovereignty and gradually take it away from you.  They finance an opposing force.  They create the opposing force, then finance it so that there's a so-called balance of power in the world.  As you recall, my Savior's Day lecture, some conspirators in America, in Congress, met at Jekyll Island in Georgia with Paul Warburg, Vanderlip, Nelson Aldrich, the maternal grandfather of Nelson Aldrich Rockefeller, a member of the US Treasury.  And they designed what later became the Federal Reserve Act.  It didn't pass at first because America never wanted a central bank to be controlled by individuals.  That was in the Constitution and it's there now.  That only Congress should have the right to print currency and the instruments of credit, but the international bankers from the House of Rothschild, who sent his sons into five countries.  One son went to England, one to France, one to Austria, one to Italy, and one stayed home in Germany with the father.  And through manipulation and money from that one son, they gained control of the Bank of England, the Bank of France, the Bank of Italy, the Bank of Austria.  And private concerns began to print money in Europe.  The Rothschild would finance both sides of all the European wars.  They always wanted to get their hands on the Central Bank of America.  And they finally did.  On December the 22nd, 1913, Congress passed into law the Federal Reserve Act.  Two months earlier, Congress and the same manipulators who crafted the bill that would later take control of the Central Bank of America.  They also crafted from the second plank of Karl Marx's Communist Manifesto what they call a graduated income tax.  The income tax was designed so that when America's debt would get greater.  They would have a means of taxing the people to pay the interest on the debt.  Now let's talk.  Woodrow Wilson sold America out.  Your president.  He got in.  in 1912 financed by international bankers.  in 1913 the Federal Reserve Act was passed and in the same year the IRS became law.  in the same year the FBI was established And in the same year, the ADL came into existence.  This is not an accident.  These four work together.  I'll prove it in a minute.  When Woodrow Wilson became president in 1913, Just before the Federal Reserve Act became law, America's national debt was nearly $1 billion.  When Woodrow Wilson left office in 1920, America's debt had risen 800%.  from one billion to eight billion.  How did the rich make America's debt grow?  The easiest way to get money is to start a war.  Woodrow Wilson campaigned on the platform that he kept us out of war.  because the war had started in Europe and if you remember George Washington and the founding fathers did not want America to be involved in Europe's wars because it looked like Europe was fighting every few weeks and the bankers were getting big, big money.  But the moment the international bankers took control of the money by taking control of the Central Bank of America, the Federal Reserve.  A war broke out in Europe and the British sent Lord Wiseman to America.  to encourage America's involvement in the war.  The Germans didn't stop any war with America.  Let's deal with truth because your government is filled with liars and thieves and murderers and it's time now that somebody take courage.  and expose it, that all of you will go free.  Well, you can put your pens up.  I know it's a little too hot for you to handle.  I'm just warming up. ",
