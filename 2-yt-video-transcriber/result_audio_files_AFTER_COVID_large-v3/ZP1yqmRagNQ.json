            "text": "My problem is I voted for them.  I'm supporting NAFTA because I think it is a positive thing to do.  And I do not pretend to be an expert on international trade matters.  When you ran for president and when Barack Obama ran for president, you both said you would renegotiate NAFTA.  You didn't.  Trade agreements like NAFTA and permanent normal trade relations with China, which forced American workers to compete against people who are making pennies an hour, has resulted in the loss of 160,000 jobs.  The president is absolutely right when he says that China has been cheating for 25 years and that Bill Clinton didn't do enough about it, George W. Bush didn't do enough about it, Barack Obama didn't do enough about it.  How exactly are you going to negotiate that?  What magic wand do you have?  A rising China is an incredibly positive development for not only China, but the United States and the rest of the world.  Rising China is a positive, positive development.  It is in our self-interest that China continue to prosper.  We want to see China rise.  China is a great nation, and we should hope for the continued expansion.  China is not our enemy.  We talk about China, is our competitor.  We should be helping.  The idea that China is going to eat our lunch is bizarre.  The idea that they are our competition, they're going to beat us, is bizarre.  China is going to eat our lunch?  Come on, man.  They're not bad folks, folks.  China's not a problem.  Allowing China into the World Trade Organization, which you supported, extending most favored nation status to China, which you supported, Those steps allowed China to take advantage of the United States by using our own open trade deals against us.  Do you think in retrospect that you were naive about China?  No.  Today we're finally ending the NAFTA nightmare and signing into law the brand new US-Mexico-Canada agreement.  Very special.  Listen, it's hard to overstate the importance of USMCA.  This is the single biggest bipartisan legislative victory for this president and this administration.  It is a huge deal.  Wage growth is better than it has been since 2009.  That means it is better than it has been for seven out of eight of the years that Obama was president.  The new USMCA has powerful protections to keep auto manufacturing jobs.  Since the election, we've created 41,000 brand new motor vehicle and parts jobs.  But doesn't he deserve some credit for that?  It's better.  The USMCA is better than NAFTA.  It is better than NAFTA.  I have never said I oppose fracking.  You said it on tape.  I did.  Show the tape.  Put it on your website.  I'll put it on.  Put it on the website.  Would there be any place for fossil fuels, including coal and fracking, in a Biden administration?  No, we would work it out.  We would make sure it's eliminated.  I guarantee we're going to end fossil fuel.  No more, no new fracking.  I'd gradually move away from fracking.  And I think it's critically important on day one that we end any fossil fuel leases on public lands.  What about, say, stopping fracking and stopping pipeline infrastructure?  They want to do the same thing I want to do.  They want to phase out fossil fuels, and we're going to phase out fossil fuels.  There's no question.  I'm in favor of banning fracking.  I have one final question.  Would he close down the oil industry?  Would you close down the oil industry?  I would transition from the oil industry, yes.  Oh, that's a big statement.  In terms of business, that's the biggest statement.  Because basically what he's saying is he is going to destroy the oil industry.  Will you remember that, Texas?  Will you remember that, Pennsylvania, Oklahoma? ",
