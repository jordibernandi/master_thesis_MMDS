This guy, I bet if you looked in the dictionary, mental moron, they show his picture there.  My God.  Minnesota State Trooper is actually going to say, and this is during COVID, he's actually going to say it's against the law to wear a mask.  Even if it wasn't during COVID, the law states one of the exemptions is medical reasons.  So you could have asthma or other things and be able to wear a mask.  He doesn't say any of that.  But this is during COVID.  And this is so stupid, I don't even really know why.  the right words to describe it.  So I would just leave it up to y'all to kind of decide for yourselves just how dumb this guy is and question just what kind of idiot the Minnesota State Troopers hire.
