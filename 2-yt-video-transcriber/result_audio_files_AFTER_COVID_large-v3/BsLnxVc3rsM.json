Now as your offspring grow in age they may receive insertions of their own which can then be passed on to their children which is shown in this diagram.  And what we'll also see is as these are passed through the generations a long-term repeat which were the bits of DNA at the sides of the insertions become less and less similar as are affected by mutation.  Now the insertion points for ERVs are spectacularly random meaning it's almost impossible for two of the same insertions to appear in the same point by chance.  This makes them very, very useful for tracing lineage, as we've done here in this very simple example.  And fully enough, the genetic trees based on ERVs match our fossil records.  And there you go, I did it in exactly 60 seconds.  Because I cut this bit off.  For example, it only took me 10 minutes to find all these examples here of how ERV insertions do support our fossil records.

It's a fantastic channel, and he does a brilliant job of explaining exactly why ERVs are brilliant evidence for evolution.  And in that video, he finds this little gem of a study.  Now, this study concentrated on just one of the families of the ovies that have insertions in humans.  And to be more specific, we're talking about 211 insertions in completely random locations.  Now, of these 211 completely random insertions, the chimpanzee shares 205, which is 97%.  And remember, these insertions are shared in the same random places.  And you can obviously read the rest of the numbers for yourself.  Now I have to stress again that the location of these insertions is completely random.  So the probability of these similarities happening by chance is, well, it's just negligible.  So Kent Holvin, going forward, if you're going to continue to talk about ERVs and how they aren't proof for evolution, I want you to talk about studies just like that.
