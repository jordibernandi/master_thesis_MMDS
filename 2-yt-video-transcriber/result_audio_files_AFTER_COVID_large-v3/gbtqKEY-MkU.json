            "text": "Are there any homeless people with a curfew who have to be outside by midnight?  My wife is seeing a therapist because I'm seeing a stewardess.  I never really understood how people are bad at math.  It doesn't add up.  If money is the root of all evil, hell must be luxurious.  In school, I never had chemistry with anybody I had chemistry with.  One Adderall plus one day off equals one clean apartment.  Nothing is for certain except death and taxes.  And death is a lot like taxes.  Everybody pays a price.  Currently, my wife isn't speaking to me.  We haven't met yet.  Money is the root of all bad acting and pornography.  A one-liner is either a good expression or a bad amount of cocaine.  Forget a manger.  Mary and Joseph should have gone on Maury's.  They would have been welcome there.  I'm only bilingual, statistically speaking.  If money could talk, Benjamin Franklin would say, I think I'm on too much cocaine.  Despite its name, autocorrect never tells me to stay in my lane.  How bad is my OCD, OCD, OCD?  All is well.  that ends well, except this state.  If two wrongs don't make a right, what were Hiroshima and Nagasaki?  I never did cocaine with Toucan Sam, but why else would he ask me to follow his nose?  Call me a criminal, but me and income tax are not on the same page.  I think bankers should play baseball because they know how to steal home.  If there was a God, alcohol would be healthy.  I'll admit I'm old when I buy a noose.  Picasso's blue period was his whole career because he sucked.  Great plagiarism is much better than original boredom.  There should be a well-funded national organization for the stupid because we're underrepresented.  People who stand in the middle of the escalator Or wear a face mask in their car when they're driving by themselves.  Or people who don't have the attention span for a traffic light.  I want to be a motivational speaker.  Put the money in the bag and I won't blow your fucking brains out.  You don't want to use the carpool lane on the road to success.  I don't have attention deficit disorder, so I'd appreciate it if you'd remind me how I started this sentence.  If I show any signs of dementia, indivisible with liberty and justice for all.  It's not whether you fall down or get back up, it's whether you have life insurance.  Life is like a box of chocolate.  Literate people know what they're getting because it says so on the inside of the box.  Without the seven, James Bond is good for nothing.  If the band played while the Titanic was sinking, drugs were involved.  If only people were as eager for Black History Month as they are for Black Friday. ",
