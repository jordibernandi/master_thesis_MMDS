            "text": "Fear, I believe, is one of the most destructive forces on the face of the earth.  In fact, fear is Satan's most powerful weapon against God's children.  You know that.  He's come against you many, many times.  The prophet Isaiah predicted fear and the pit and the snare will come upon all the inhabitants of the earth, Isaiah 24, 17.  Then he added these words.  He said, \"...it shall come to pass that he who flees from the noise of the fear...\" will fall into the pit, and he that comes out of the pit shall be taken in the snare.  And here's what the prophet saw.  He saw multitudes in the last days living in a prison of fear, in pits of despair, and snared in trouble and sorrow as no other generation.  And the pit in Hebrew means a personal living hell, and the snare means a trapped feeling.  And Isaiah is looking at our day and nothing describes our time better than that. ",

We are fastly approaching a day and an hour where the enemy is going to use everything he can against your mind, listen to me, to strike fear.  I can prove to you from the book of Daniel where it talks about he will seek to wear out the saints of the Most High, that that's dealing with the mind.  And your battle right now is in your mind.  And in your mind is all the fear and the scenarios and the what-ifs.  Are you listening to me?  The reason why some of you cannot walk in the power of the Holy Ghost is because the enemy holds you paralyzed by fear.  I'm going to tell you something, folks.  There's a spirit of fear that's trying to cripple our world right now.  Are you listening to me?  All the stuff we don't understand, we don't know.  And you get all the stuff that starts going through your brain.  Is this making sense?  And then you got the spirit of the Antichrist that I'm going to wear you out.  I'm going to keep attacking you with fear and blasphemy.  And I'm going to question the word of God in your life.  And I'm going to make you question whether or not you even think God loves you.  That's what it exactly means. ",

The floods have lifted up, O Lord, the floods have lifted up their voice.  The floods lift up their ways.  Now, how?  Look at me, please.  How do you deal with this flood when fears come in and flood your mind?  When you think you're going down, when you think you're not going to make it, when you think you're going to fail God or you've not measured up.  What do you do when the enemy comes in like a flood?  You see, the Lord raises up a standard.  Let me show you what that standard is.  Look at verse 1. ",

I've got my sword in hand.  I am more powerful.  I am mightier than all your floods.  I'm bigger than all your fears.  Get your eyes off your fears.  He said, I've guarded myself.  That hit me.

When Abram is called to leave his father's house, God sends him a tweet.  Don't be afraid.  When God prepares to send Moses to Pharaoh, Elijah to Isaiah, Jeremiah to the children of Israel, Ezekiel to the Israelites, he tells all of them when they're called, don't be afraid.  As God and Jehoshaphat are about to go to war, God sends Isaiah and Jehaziel respectively with a message to give them, don't be afraid.  When Nehemiah stands on the wall, the word to God to him is, don't be afraid.  When the children of Israel prepare to enter the promised land repeatedly in the book of Deuteronomy, God gives the commandment through Moses, don't be afraid.  When Joshua steps up to leadership and take on the mantle of Moses before he makes his first leadership move, God tells him repeatedly, Don't be afraid.  When the angel comes down to Bethlehem to tell folk about Jesus and John the Baptist, Zacharias, Joseph, and Mary are all told, don't be afraid.  When Jesus walks to the disciples on the middle of the water, in the middle of the storm, the first words out of his mouth are, don't be afraid.  When the women show up at the tomb of a resurrected Jesus, the angel's message to them is, don't be afraid.  When Jesus meets the first eyewitnesses of his resurrection, his commandment to them is, Don't be afraid.  When Jesus converts Saul on the road to Damascus and he's sent to Ananias, Ananias is told, don't be afraid.  When Paul is getting ready to speak to the church at Corinth, the Holy Spirit convicts him and tells him, don't be afraid.  Because the Lord knows that if ever there's something you need to hear, it's the words of this psalmist, David.  that whenever life has pushed your fear button, I want you to take a full dose of the Lord is my light and my salvation.  Whenever you've got enemies circling around your life, you need to take two pills of, though a host should encamp against me and wars may rise, in this will I be confident.  When you don't know how it's going to turn out and you're worried on every side, I need you to lay down holding on to, in the time of trouble, he shall hide me. ",
