            "text": "Being able to understand Marx's critique of classical political economy and capitalism requires a firm grasp of the concept of the commodity as Marx outlined it.  Marx intentionally starts out Das Kapital, generally known as his most developed work, with an analysis of the commodity, which rests at the heart of the capitalist mode of production.  Marx dissects the commodity to reveal its complex nature and its connection to the social relations embedded in capitalism as an economic system.  What is a commodity?  It is difficult to define what a commodity is, according to Marx, because, as we will see, there are many critical parts worth noting.  Marx does not provide a comprehensive, condensed definition of the commodity.  part of the reason why he does not do this is because the commodity existed outside of the historical period of capitalist development and as such took on different albeit less important roles in social and economic relations.  of course marx was primarily concerned with the commodity as it came to be in the capitalist system.  Let's try and deal with some of the mysteries surrounding this concept of the commodity by considering a simple and general maxim regarding the commodity.  The commodity must fulfill a human want or need.  The product of any labor that does not meet this basic criterion cannot be traded and thus bears no value.  We will explore this concept in greater detail a little later on.  Basically, a commodity must be valued within society in some way.  It must have value.  Well, what is value?  Can we see value?  Can we measure it?  What defines value?  Marx points out that there is a common denominator to all commodities.  They are the products of human labor.  They all contain a certain amount of congealed labor, which he ultimately labels as the determinant of value itself.  In other words, commodities all hold some quantity of labour, and that labour gives the commodities value.  Marx isolates the exchange of commodities as the point at which we can see how labour, in a very abstract manner, takes on its role as a source of value.  So, all commodities values are, as Marx puts it, congealed homogenous human labour.  Marx talks frequently about this notion of concrete and abstract labour.  To put it simply, concrete labour is the labour that actually happens on the factory floor.  It's the hammering of the nail, the welding of the metal, the stitching of the shirt, etc.  But abstract labor is a little more tricky.  Here, Marx is talking about the fact that when we exchange commodities, in acknowledging equivalence between qualitative differences, that is, the difference between the bottle of wine and the three metal hammers, we are actually also acknowledging the equivalence of the quantitative magnitude of labor embodied in the commodities themselves.  a bottle of wine is traded for three hammers on the market.  the labor used to produce those commodities is treated as universal labor though a single hammer might have taken less socially necessary labor time to make.  and don't worry we will return to this term.  we know that after enough hammers we can eventually get our bottle of wine and in the market.  we can supposedly do this with any commodity exactly because they are all made up of that wispy abstract and homogeneous labor.
