            "text": "how's everybody doing?  my name is anthony brian logan and today we got to talk about candace owens versus cardi b. now this particular battle if you will is really hot right now.  all over the internets there's all kind of memes about it all kind of posts about it.  it's so big it's so popular that it might make the national news by this evening.  now before i go any further i gotta back up a and how we've gotten here today.  You guys should know who Candace Owens is.  You're talking about one of the most popular political figures.  that's not in politics, meaning she does a lot of what I do, what many others do, comment about politics.  She also does public appearances, speaking engagements.  She has a whole organization called Blexit with my brother Brandon Tatum, which is politically motivated in my humble opinion.  So she is probably the most popular political figure.  that's not political, meaning an elected official.  And really, she's probably more popular than most elected officials, aside from Trump himself.  And that's kind of an arguable point, but I'll move on.  Cardi B is a very popular rapper.  Probably the most popular rapper in the country.  I mean, aside from Drake, Future, people like that, she's right up there at the top.  She has a top song in the nation called WAP.  I won't get into that song right now.  This is a family show, so I'll move on.  The point is that she's very popular, very well-known, and very influential, especially among young people.  Now, Candace Owens had challenged her to a debate a year or so ago, probably about two years ago now, when she was with Turning Point.  It might have been some cash on the table.  I don't know about that, but it might have been some money on the table.  And I think if that was the case, the point of the debate would be to have Candace Cardi B with her big following Candace with her big following come together and then people that are kind of on the fence that don't really know which way to go can hear them both and make their own mind up.  all right and that would make sense.  now Candace Owens did an interview recently with Ben Shapiro and Ben Shapiro had been critical of Cardi B as well as Candace because Cardi B has been doing a lot of political stuff although she's ignorant politically.  And Candace is saying what I said in my video.  I'm not saying she took what I said.  I'm saying that what she said is the same as what I said and what many others have said.  And that's the fact that it's insulting for Joe Biden to select Cardi B for an interview.  On the week, mind you, on the week of the DNC, their interview was taped, of course.  It came out the Monday of the Democratic National Convention.  The Sunday before that, they didn't do any Sunday shows, meaning Kamala Harris or Joe Biden.  They didn't do Fox News, MS-13 DNC, CBS, ABC.  They didn't do anything.  They just... stayed at home, and then randomly dropped this interview with Elle magazine with Cardi B on the Monday at the DNC.  It's like, really, Cardi B?  You couldn't find anybody more politically knowledgeable than Cardi B to do an interview with?  It's insulting.  It's like, you know what?  I don't care about the black vote, really.  I don't care about none of that, the urban.  Look.  She got big followers, big numbers, and she got this song.  I don't care if it's vulgar or wet, that's fine.  Put it out there, get some black votes and give us a fried chicken.  That's pretty much how I saw it.  And I think many of us out here saw it the same way.  And of course, Candace did.  Now, Cardi B caught one of that interview and got triggered all over her Instagrams.  And if you want to see those videos between Cardi and Candace, I'll place those in the box below.  So you're able to see and hear it for yourself.  But she was asking Candace, why wouldn't Joe Biden, you know, interview with me?  I got a bunch of followers.  People know who I am.  All this, that and the third.  Well, like I said, the reason why I should not give you interviews because you're not really a serious person.  You can't even pronounce politics.  She said politics.  Ma'am, you can barely speak English.  She can speak Spanish.  I'm not really sure how well because I don't speak Spanish.  She can speak Spanish, but she grew up in New York City.  She was born and raised in the Bronx.  It's not like she came from Dominican Republic or Puerto Rico or somewhere and then learned English later.  I can understand if you have an accent when you came to the country at a later date, but she was born and raised here.  Why can't you pronounce politics right?  When you are about 30 years old or somewhere close to it and you were born and raised in New York City, what's really going on?  Where's the education?  That's what I'm talking about.  That's what Candace is saying as well, that Cardi B is not really an educated person.  So anyway, Cardi B goes on this whole thing about, oh, well... You want to attack me, but I got a lot of followers and I got money and I paid a bunch of taxes.  Oh, and that's something else.  Why would you be supportive of Joe Biden and then before that Bernie Sanders all this year when you complain about paying a lot of money in taxes?  Don't you understand that especially Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden, they're out there talking about we're going to raise taxes on the 1%.  That's you, Cardi B. You are a multimillionaire.  You say you pay millions in taxes.  You want to pay more in taxes.  And you live in New York City probably still.  So you're paying all that New York City tax, New York State tax, federal income tax, wealth tax, estate, all kind of stuff you're paying on for what?  OK, and you want to vote for more of it?  What are you thinking about?  politically ignorant?  And that's what Candace was saying.  But I'm getting off track.  Cardi B put out her video on Instagram talking about Candace's interview with Ben Shapiro.  And then Candace responded.  And this was.  Man, oh man, you're talking about a knockdown drag out.  This was not actually a knockdown drag out.  This was an annihilation, a pummeling.  This was somebody getting stomped into wine, into dust, into nothingness.  This was 1987 Mike Tyson versus a guy on the street.  You're talking about one hitter quitter.  And it just displays a level of intellect that Candace Owens has versus Cardi B. That level of knowledge, of education, of learnedness that Candace Owens had versus Cardi B. Cardi B reminds me of a person that just, you know, a typical person in the hood that Is ignorant, but thinks that they know more than what they know.  Now, I'm not saying everybody in the hood is like that.  I come from the hood, too.  And I was always just reading, reading, reading, reading, you know, and I still read every day now.  I don't know everything.  I never know everything.  I can't know everything.  I'm always reading and learning more.  I can never say I have the definitive answer on all things.  I know a lot about a lot of different things.  You know, I do know that water is wet.  I know some definitive things, but not everything.  Cardi B does not know a lot, which is why Joe Biden should not have given her an interview.  Candace had a great response to Cardi B's lives on her Instagram page.  It was a short video, probably about eight to 10 minutes, and she was shooting straight from the hip, but I loved it.  I loved every minute.  She was able to address all of what Cardi B was saying in very clear and concise ways, all right?  One thing she was saying was about The lie that Cardi B said talking about.  Trump laughed at black men getting shot by the police.  I mean, where's any evidence of that, Cardi B?  Do you have that?  You're going to put it out there.  It's a lie.  Trump didn't say it.  All right.  If you want to say that he said something without any evidence, it's a lie.  from my point of view, and then beyond that, Cardi B was talking about how her sister Hennessy, which is crazy, you got Bacardi and Hennessy, but anyway, her sister Hennessy was at the beach arguing with Trump supporters, and she's a lesbian, Hennessy that is, So she was saying that Trump and Trump supporters are homophobic.  It's like, what do you mean?  Trump was probably one of the most pro LGBT presidents we've had.  He's not even a guy that really cares.  I remember back in the day when Bruce Jinder or Caitlyn Jenner, whatever the name is, was talking about they want to go use the bathroom in the toilet at Trump Tower.  Trump was like, whatever, do what you want.  He's more LGBT friendly than I am.  OK, so where is any evidence of that?  And also about police reform, because in the interview that Cardi B did with Joe Biden, she was asking about what are we going to do about black men getting shot by the police?  And the candidates was like, well, Joe Biden should ask you, what are black men going to do about it?  What are black men going to do about their own communities?  And then she was talking about how Cardi B's husband, who was offset from the group called Amigos, a rap group, She was saying that her husband was more likely to kill her than an officer is.  And that's facts.  That's big time facts.  OK, the black on black.  If Cardi B is black, different story.  The black on black murder rate is is exponentially more likely and more impactful and more prominent than.  white cop on black innocent person.  There's no comparison actually, so Candace was right.  People were trying to say, oh, Candace said a black man would probably kill you, all this and that.  Nah, she's just giving you the numbers, the statistics.  The facts don't lie here.  People can get upset and get triggered and hurt, but it doesn't change the facts.  Overall, Candace Owens really handled Cardi B. It was a sight to see for sure.  But this just shows the level of intellect between those that are politically aware and those that aren't.  And Cardi B can become politically aware.  I'm not sure.  Oh, she's probably like 28 or close to 30 somewhere.  She's not quite 30 yet, if I'm not mistaken.  So maybe she can become educated and learn a little bit more later.  But right now, she's still got the hood rat girl, uneducated, not knowing how to read type thing going on.  That can't improve.  what right now is not really there.  She's trying to become better, but it's not working for her right now.  So shout out to Candace Owens.  You did a great job handling Cardi B. Cardi B, you got to tighten up, get back in the gym, train, train your mind, and come back sharper the next time.  But I think I'll leave that right there for now.  And what say you?  Do you think that Candace Owens won that exchange?  If that's your viewpoint let me know why in the comments below.  Or do you think Cardi B won that exchange?  If that's your viewpoint let me know why in the comments below.  You guys know where I stand.  It was pretty much a pummeling from Candace Owens to Cardi B. Cardi B had no chance.  I mean, she was a tomato can out there in the ring.  An opponent that's easily defeated in boxing terms, MMA.  She was that in the ring.  Like I said, she could come back, train a little bit more, and be better prepared, but she's totally unprepared.  And this goes back to the original point.  Why would Joe Biden interview with a person like that out of everybody in the world, okay?  You have some people on the left that are intelligent.  Now, I disagree with them politically, but they are intelligent enough to ask you serious questions.  because something else Candace said was about Charlamagne Tha God over at the Breakfast Club.  That's where the whole you ain't black thing came out.  Charlamagne is a leftist, does not like white people.  That's a fact.  But at least he was able to ask her some questions that came from an intellectual headspace or a thinking headspace.  All right.  Some some serious things and not just, you know, a wish list.  Give me this.  Give me that.  Talking about all my taxes are high.  But this guy is talking about raising taxes.  Like, what are we even doing?  Let's do things that make sense.  But whatever your thoughts are, please let me know in the comments below.  And that's all I got to say for this video.  If you like what you heard, please comment, rate, share, and subscribe.  Peace.
