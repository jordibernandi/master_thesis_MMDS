            "text": "G'day guys, how you doing?  It's the Kiwi, back with another video.  Back rather quickly too.  Anyway, in the previous video we talked about the sacrifice and actually how it plays into our lives in regards to, depending on the level of what we do in regards to wanting to go our own way, will also play into what our life's journey is going to be, what we are going to experience, what will unfold before us.  And at the end of that video, what I put was a little comment stating, you know, avoid the military at all possible costs.  Got a few comments, got some interest in what have you.  I can't remember the gentleman's name.  There was a young chap who is from France, was talking about wanting to join the French Foreign Legion.  And he wanted to know a little bit more about my thoughts and what have you on the subject.  And The interesting thing is that for myself personally, I actually have no problem with the military.  It's one of those necessary things that we need in our lives,  etc.,  etc.  However, when you put yourself in a position in the military potentially to become sacrificed, what happens is if you join the U.S.  military, you become a GI, which is government issue.  And When you put yourself in a position in life to be sacrificed for the ends of another individual or another group of individuals, from my perspective, it's not a particularly smart thing to do.  Now, that being said, if it's something that somebody has had this deep down desire to do, this heart-centered desire, you know, feeling of like, this is what I want to do, this is what I've been born for, hey, you know, have at it.  It's not up to me to stop you from doing whatever it is that you want to do.  That's not my job.  My job is only to put out the information that I've learned through my own personal experiences in life and how all those different personal experiences, information, knowledge, research and everything How it all ties into a larger perspective.  And it doesn't necessarily have to be the military that you join to end up being sacrificed.  You can, as I said in the previous video, everything is sacrificial in this world.  It's like, you know, I mentioned you always see nature.  Nature is continually self-sacrificing itself, you know.  Everything in this world, you know, it's the circle of life.  something is is born something dies then there's a rebirth then there's another death and it goes on and on and on.  that's just how it works here and it's it's very interesting that particular point because why is it that way here?  if we are these these beings that are down here and we've ex you know we're from from a place that some people could call a heaven or the other side, or beyond the veil, or any of that sort of stuff, why can't we just live here forever?  Why can't we just experience an eternal bliss?  Well, the reality behind this world, this place that we live in, it is about sacrifice.  It is, 100%.  Because, believe it or not, you and I have already sacrificed ourselves to actually be here.  We volunteer, whatever you wanna call that other side, when we leave that world and we come down here, we have volunteered to be here.  Straight up, honest to God, swear.  We have, as a soul, as a being, whatever you wanna call us, we have volunteered to be here.  We are no fucking joke.  Seriously, we are no joke.  There's a reason why, if there is life out there, there's a reason why they don't want us crossing over.  It's, we're no joke.  No joke whatsoever.  There's a reason why they call us the titans.  In mythology, they call human beings the Titans.  And this is how it works.  I swear I can't make this up.  This is how it works.  When I died, the one thing I learned was everything is consciousness.  Everything is pure consciousness and it comes from one sole pinpoint source.  Whatever you want to call that source, a higher power, God, creation, whatever you want to call it, it's real.  And what that entity, what that energy wanted to do was to grow and to expand on itself.  And to do that, it had to create these different environments throughout the whole universe.  And we are part of that grand experiment.  Now, in us volunteering to be here, by sacrificing ourselves to be here and to have this experience, that entity is actually experiencing a whole different life via us for itself.  It's learning more about everything, and I mean everything, via us for itself.  When you look at everything and understand that everything is pure energy, everything is pure consciousness, from every blade of grass, to the sheep, to the trees, to the water, water's pure consciousness, to you, to me, everything.  Everything is pure consciousness.  It all comes from the same source.  It comes from the same energy source.  And what happens is we are a part of that energy source and we're like, drop down.  And here we are.  Sup man.  And the reality of the situation is that as we go down our God given path, That's what they call in the Bible performing God's will, okay?  If we go down our God-given chosen path in life, then what will happen is you are expanding your consciousness.  You start growing, okay?  Now, when you look at these cities and you look at how specific groups of people are controlling and trying to force human beings into these little pockets around the world, into these big, what they call super cities now, you're not going to grow.  You're not going to expand your consciousness.  You're not going to become one with nature.  You're not going to grow in any way, shape or form.  But in saying that and in understanding that, you have to realize that there's a group of people that also know what I've just explained to you.  And this is where Jordan Peterson is very correct in saying, choose your sacrifice wisely.  You need to bloody choose wisely, I think his exact words were.  And he's 100% correct because there really truly is A select group of people who know exactly what I'm talking about and they know exactly how the sacrifice works and they're more than happy to sacrifice you and me for their ends.  That's how this world is currently being created.  It's being created by millions upon millions, if not billions of lives that have been sacrificed to actually bring about their goals, their society as we know it.  And that's where the military really comes in.  Because the military today, it's like the hitman for the mob, just about.  Oh no, not just about, it actually is.  Today's modern military, especially in the United States or Britain, Canada, Germany, They are the hammer that is used to subdue these other countries and these other nations.  And it's utilized by the people that run these massive corporations.  And think about what I said in regards to how nature continually is sacrificing itself and will rebuild itself.  Okay, look at what happened during the Second World War.  Hiroshima, Nagasaki.  wiped off the face of the earth.  New cities have flourished.  Berlin, countries in Europe, Eastern Europe, completely razed to the ground, completely rebuilt again.  And these individuals understand that.  So they understand that by sacrificing all these lives, what does nature, if we're a part of nature and they're sacrificing us at the extent that they sacrifice us at, and we're a part of nature, what is nature going to do?  It's going to rebuild itself.  And it rebuilds itself and those individuals, they profit from it.  Everything, that's how this whole system works.  And so if these individuals are doing this for profit, And to grow their empires.  Then how can it possibly be.  That what I'm saying.  Could be a lie.  Could be bullshit.  One of the things I learned.  It was very interesting.  One of the things I learned.  When I went through the Ronald Reagan library.  In 2008.  I had all his journals laid out.  Not all his journals.  But some of his journals.  Ronald Reagan was a prolific journaler.  And.  And one of the journals that I was reading, I got to the end of the journal and I was like, what the heck?  And I got the curator, could you turn the page over?  Well, what it was, was Ronald Reagan had his own personal astrology.  He didn't do anything without consulting that astrology.  He didn't do anything without seeing where the stars and the alignments of the planets and this and that and everything else was at.  He did not make one major decision or choice or action or sign a law or anything without consulting that individual and what was going on in the entire universe.  And he's not the only president in the United States who have done that and also in the entire world.  There is a plethora of world leaders who are who are very aware of this stuff.  There's no accident, no accident in any way, shape or form that 2020, when we're meant to have a clear vision, 2020 vision, a clear vision of our future, a clear vision of our direction, a clear vision of awakening and everything else.  It's no accident that COVID-19 just happened to show up and they shut everything down.  And that's what concerns me about what's going on right now, more than anything, is you've got this group of people over here that are trying to keep control of everything and trying to bring about their own collective, think about that, their own collective consciousness.  then you've got a group of people in humanity that are wanting to go their own way and do their own thing and learn who they are and then figure out where they fit into the combined human consciousness.  natural.  you've got unnatural laws over here and then you've got the natural laws of nature and that's why we're seeing again.  even more craziness is.  these are getting polar opposites.  They're stretching out further and further and further.  The left is going so far left, it's unbelievable.  And the left is going so far left, right, that anybody that's in this side here, they're just sitting there outside.  Oh shit, this isn't gonna be good.  When you start fighting the natural laws of nature, creation, that higher power, the kickback is not good.  That's the other reason why I really wouldn't recommend anybody getting involved in the military because I don't know why, I just have a funny feeling that there's going to be some shit hitting the fan here within the next 10 years.  And it's not going to be good in any way, shape or form.  I don't know.  Just based on how I understand how things work, that's just what I know.  So, again, how this works is you have already sacrificed yourself to be here.  And you've been sacrificed, you've volunteered to be here.  Alright?  And your volunteering to be here is to learn about your own consciousness and your own path and to perform God's will, which is just to go your own way, to do your own thing, so the actual consciousness of the entire universe can actually learn about itself via your experience.  And you are your own world.  There's 8 billion little worlds bouncing around Just this realm.  And this pinpoint, this key point of energy, it's learning about all these different experiences.  And by it learning about all these different experiences, it's growing and growing and growing.  However, over the last few thousand years, humanity's ability to actually understand who it is and what it is has gone... It just fell down into a black hole.  And God, creation, nature is pretty fed up with it.  So I would highly recommend learning about yourself.  So until next time, make it great guys.  Cheers. ",
