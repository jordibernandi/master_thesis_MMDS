            "text": "Hey everyone, so whether you like it or not, the human experience, our life, has pretty much been completely engulfed by the internet.  Pretty obvious, whether it be because you prefer it here, or maybe it's just necessity, or you're in a lockdown city where you'll get curb stomped by the police for leaving your house.  In the face of all this, we need to discuss our digital image because we are no longer given the same human graciousness of meeting face to face and judging an individual right there and then.  Even if we do meet in person for a job interview or a date, usually there's a bit of pre-meeting research done and we become a series of Google image searches and Facebook profile results.  God forbid someone find your cringy DeviantArt profile, or even worse, a potential employer sees a tagged photo of you from a party in 2007 where you dressed as Beyonc\u00e9 and wore a little too much bronzer.  Of course, I am well aware of the fact that my digital image is a total mess all over the place.  I've semi-made peace with it.  But in my understanding of having a widely defamed, praised, and overall controversial reputation online, I have some warnings and predictions I feel are necessary to make as the rest of your images become ever more archived on the internet as well.  Initially, when I got into media, I had this very naive view that if someone lies about you, that's illegal.  If someone publishes something that's false, that's illegal.  We hear it all the time.  If your image is tarnished, sue, complain, go to the courts.  This is basically a farce.  If you don't know, I'm just going to use this as an example.  I'm in a bit of a tiff with Wikipedia at the moment.  Currently, there are a number of editors monitoring my page and ensuring it is as horrifying as humanly possible to any normal person who may go read it.  And it's not just me.  There are activist users such as Grayfell who seemingly spend all their day obsessing over pages of people like Andy Ngo, Jack Posobiec, Douglas Murray, and others just to... Name a few I've seen edited recently.  Grayfowl even removed all mention of violence from Antifa's Wikipedia page.  Clearly a very reliable and bipartisan encyclopedia.  My introduction doesn't include anything about me being a filmmaker or an author or basically what I'm known for.  They just straight up decide to say, alt-right white nationalists.  And in fact, if you looked at the page a month ago, it said straight up white supremacist, full stop.  No references, no proof, no links, nothing.  If you try to edit the page to fall in with Wiki's own guidelines, such as including my rejection of far-right labeling and identification as a conservative, you'll actually just get banned from editing the page altogether.  I won't get into all the violations and defamation in there because it would be a whole video in and of itself, but it got to the extent at one point where for a decent stretch of time my page actually said I was an advocate for nuking the city of Melbourne.  Just throw genocidal maniac in there for a few months, why don't you?  Wikipedia.  But this, I mean, once again, this isn't exactly what I wanted to talk about today.  The reason I bring this up is because any sane person would say that shouldn't be legal.  You can sue them.  Imagine if a potential employer thought I genuinely wanted to nuke cities.  That's... That might be an awkward conversation.  It might hurt some opportunities.  And while of course I have sent a notice to Wiki's legal team, suing Wikipedia isn't actually an option for people.  They are considered a platform, not a publisher.  So that means the people who publish content are responsible for said content.  not the platform itself, i.e.  Wikipedia.  Some of you may have heard about this under section 230.  Now, when it comes to any one Wikipedia page, it's like a giant quilt work of people's writing.  It's not like you can go and sue one person for an entire page.  hundreds of people have stitched that page together, hundreds of people using anonymous usernames.  So you'd first have to go and file for a Norwich order, which costs a lot of money to find out who an editor was, and then you'd have to do that for potentially hundreds of editors, which costs even more money.  Then you'd have to actually file a defamation suit, which costs insane amounts of money, especially if you're going to do that against hundreds of people.  which makes this course of action essentially impossible for the average person and even the more upper middle class person.  So when individuals say, well, you can't just lie about people, that's illegal.  No, defamation is only illegal against rich people.  And that's just the damn truth.  You have to be able to afford to enforce this law.  And perhaps you're thinking, well, that's just Wikipedia.  What about a normal publisher?  I have had the most cut and dry cases in the world.  Such as Channel 7 saying I self-identify as a fascist and a racist.  Maybe you could get away with calling me those things as your opinion because I'm a public figure, but you certainly can't claim.  that's how I describe myself.  I couldn't afford the case at the time.  Costs thousands to even begin the process.  Then around $500 per hour for... whoever is working on your case, and that may be multiple people, and these cases can and do take years upon years.  I got into media as a teenage cocktail waitress who had to search for a change in her car seat just to fill up gas in the car.  And there are many dissident voices out there who are in the same position as me.  Many commentators who have had article after article with completely false information just build up over time without any recourse and even if you are extremely lucky and you're able to find a lawyer to do things pro bono or you get to a point where you can afford to combat articles lying about you in the past the statute of limitations is typically one year so essentially defamation is legal as long as your victim is too poor to combat it and you never have to worry about them saving up the money one day because after a year you're in the clear.  What blows my mind about this is if you asked the average person on the street, whether they'd prefer a journalist, call them a pedophile in a popular newspaper or get punched in the face, I reckon.  most people would opt for getting punched in the face because you can just put an ice pack on it and move on with your life.  Whereas that article will follow you around through your relationships, your job prospects, all of it.  Yet if you assault someone, you'll go to jail.  But if you're a journalist who defames and destroys someone's life, there's almost no punishment.  And there's very little recourse for the average person who is the victim of their lies.  I'm just using myself as an example, and some of you may think, well, you asked for this attention, happens to every public figure, boo-hoo, Lauren, get over it.  Fair enough, but it's important to remember.  this happens to regular people who aren't political, who didn't ask for any attention at all, all the time.  I read a horrible story just before making this video about a Polish photographer who took photos of a Santa sleigh crash and was then quoted in the UK media as saying the couple who crashed were drunk and were putting other people in harm's way.  The only problem was they were not drunk, it was a horrible incident, and the photographer Molandinsky had never given them any quote at all.  But these English clickbait sites needed some context for the wild photo they had found and wanted to publish, so they just invented the context and bigger and bigger outlets continued to republish the story.  The photographer's reputation was destroyed in his town.  People hated him, thought he had intentionally slandered the couple.  The poor guy didn't leave his house for a year and had to go on medication to deal with his anxiety over it all.  He begged the outlets to correct things and never got any response.  The couple who were accused of being drunk had their business severely damaged and also attempted to get the stories taken down by trying to sue, but the case was considered not to be a public interest by the prosecutor they approached.  Polish media have extremely strict standards for quotations and accuracy, so many people in the town just refused to believe their side of the story.  All of their lives, the photographer, the couple, their mental health, just completely destroyed and No punishment for any of the outlets that did this to them.  Now, to tie this all in with my warnings and predictions for the future, it's important to look in contrast at the other side of this, those who are able to fight defamation battles.  You look at someone like Ben Shapiro, for example.  He said some things that I wouldn't even think to say, like... Arabs like to bomb crap and live in open sewage.  While this is certainly an offensive quote, we as people are not the sum total of the most offensive tweet or quote you can find that we've made.  And while it has been brought up once or twice by media, Ben Shapiro certainly is not summed up by quotes like this.  He's judged and reported on as a mainstream conservative figure, whereas newer dissident figures are given a much harsher judgment, certainly if they were to say something like this.  The reason is, realistically, if a mainstream paper even thought to call Ben Shapiro alt-right or racist, he'd have a lawyer on retainer that would deal with it instantly.  I'm glad he can do this.  I want this to be done to papers more.  But should the laws around something as important as people's reputations really be a buy-your-way-to-justice system?  And this would be a bad enough problem as it is, but with the internet, we're now seeing a whole new sphere of reputational manipulation being created.  The wealthy don't just have more of an ability to stop defamation, they have the ability to stop criticism in some cases and even scrub their indiscretions entirely.  Of course, a famous example is Harvey Weinstein.  Although this didn't last forever, Harvey was able to blackmail and literally hire spies to threaten women to protect his reputation and prevent the release of negative articles.  And once you've achieved these preliminary steps of avoiding defamation, preventing actual criticism, and even covering up crimes, as a wealthy elite, you can even invent an entire world where you have a fake spotless reputation.  In a fascinating article called How the 1% Scrubs Its Image Online, the Wall Street Journal investigated the story of a man named Jacob Gottlieb.  who was trying to start a new hedge fund but having troubles because his last one had totally failed and was mired in scandal.  So what did he do?  He hired a Texas-based company which specialized in reputational management called StatusLab.  Articles started popping up all over the web about what an incredible man he was and what a stunning reputation he had, some saying he had even donated to hospitals and charities.  The problem was none of this was true.  And even the details which were, were simply fake articles written to whitewash his reputation.  And StatusLab were able to push SEO and ensure these fake articles were at the top of Google instead of his scandals.  Once again, he was obviously exposed, but there are many, many people who hire these firms who never get caught.  And the cost?  Well, tens of thousands of dollars.  It was a friend of mine who told me about this story in the first place after he inquired with Status Labs and told me their just beginning quote fee was 20 grand.  Which, that seems huge for you and I, but for the wealthy... a small price for a perfect reputation because reputation is everything in the world right now.  One Google search means you get the job or you don't, you get the date or you don't, but it doesn't really matter anymore if you're actually decent or not because decency is up for sale.  Consider this.  The media write a story about some high schooler making a racist comment.  Turns out, they got the details wrong or exaggerated what happened, and that high schooler and their parents cannot afford for the life of them to sue for defamation.  By the time they can, it's past the statute of limitations, And this follows the kid around for the rest of his life.  Meanwhile, there could be a total asshole bully from his school who beat people up and, I don't know, was a serial blackfacer like Justin Trudeau or something.  But that kid is able to have their parents pay to threaten a newspaper and almost certainly get an article removed if it's exposed.  And if that doesn't work, they'll just hire an organization like Status Lab.  to scrub their child's image on Google and social media.  They'll then buy their child followers and likes to ensure they seem popular and well-respected in the community, which doesn't even cost that much if you're willing to throw your integrity out the window.  The kid will probably then put vegan influencer and social rights activist in their bio and add the link to their Instagram with 20,000 followers on all their resume.  If you thought we had it bad with simply a wealth divide, now we're going to have a total reputation divide.  One that is entirely held up by lies, fake followers, false reputation scrubbing, false articles defaming individuals, and censorship of any defense those people may have had.  Which is terrifying because what this is going to result in is the elites are going to increasingly be able to paint themselves as saints and gods in the eyes of the public.  while anyone who questions them will be pummeled to the ground with false defamatory articles, pummeled by bad SEO ratings, banned from even giving their side of the story, and unable to have any recourse to any of this.  Good luck getting a job to even begin saving for legal fees after your reputation is shot.  In the modern era, there is no justice for defamation for the majority.  The digital world has put sainthood up for sale.  And mark my words, this is not going to end well for anyone. ",
