I'd have to go in and from time to time the guy I always called the colonel would have me doing things.  I wasn't a mechanic.  I had no technical knowledge of anything.  And one thing I want to make clear from the get-go, in each instance, every crap we went into, because on sci-fi movies, you know, it looks like they hadn't been doing their house clean.  They were like clinically clean, like you were in a surgical room.  They didn't have cobwebs, things of this sort.  But the situation is that you go in there and, you know, you've just entered another reality.  I mean, here it is, we have a craft.  35-foot diameter on the outside.  This would have been in 1986, I believe.  We went in, and there were several instances like this, but it never ceases to amaze you.  30, 35-foot diameter on the outside, and you're awed when you go in there because you're thinking, okay, something's not right here.  Because it looks much bigger on the inside, but how can that be?  It's only 30, 35 foot diameter on the outside.  It couldn't be any bigger than that.  And it definitely couldn't be bigger than that on the inside.  But when you go in, I can explain it now, but it's hard for people to understand.  It was hard for me to understand when I first heard about it.  But then you'd go ahead and look up because, I mean, it was only maybe, what, 12 feet high, things of this sort.  Yet here it is.  This was maybe, I don't know, 40, 50 foot tall on the inside.  And I'm wondering, how can this be?  So we would go ahead and measure that.  The interesting thing, you saw no lights, but it was perfectly bright on the inside, not overlit, not underlit.  You had no problem seeing.  But then, you know, here it is.  Remember, we're working, and I have to stress this, 30, 35 foot in diameter.  But then you have, like, ladders.  that go up on several levels, maybe I think three, I'm going to say three, it could have been more, but at least three levels.  Then you'd have little walkways there, and you'd have compartments there.  that, you know, people are entities, and I'm sorry, I still consider them to be people within their own right.  that would go in there.  I don't know where they were living quarters, what they were actually there for, but they served a purpose, but there were rooms on board the craft. ",

Now, the control panels was unique in that they didn't have, like, you know, on board a fighter aircraft, you have a control stick.  It was like I know this now, but it was just the impression at the time that they were controlling with the instruments they had by just putting their hands over it or moving them over it, and they could control the craft that way.  And the whole situation is they could program the craft to be like on automatic pilot by certain motions of the hand.  And there was also an avoidance system where they wouldn't crash into one another.  They would get real close to aircraft, our aircraft, but just before there'd be a collision, they would immediately go ahead and break off from making contact with the aircraft.  They had other rooms that looked like there was some type of... things going on within these other, like they were electronic components of something that they were working with.  I have no idea what they were.  You also had areas that looked like they were living quarters.  because they had like cots there, things of that sort.  And I'm using the wrong word, cots, because, you know, not like on a submarine is the best way to put it.  They also had, I guess, where they would go and change into various types of clothing that they would have to wear to do certain functions.  They had all of that there.  But here again... where you'd go ahead and expect to find trash cans where they'd have trash put into them.  Mm-mm.  Trash on the floor.  Mm-mm.
