            "text": "Gentlemen, gentlemen, how you guys doing?  How are you?  How are you?  I hope you guys don't have to use them freaking clubs, man.  My man, I like that in you, bro.  Sarge.  Hi, how are you?  I'm very good.  Could you ID yourself?  Sergeant O'Leary.  Very good.  I'm loving you.  Your man down there had nothing but disdain and disrespect for me.  He was really our city.  If you guys are serious about turning stuff around, why don't you walk down there with me and let's talk to this guy, see if he'll ID.  What's his name?  His name is Moot.  Rule 37 of your policy, as you're aware, is you will ID to all people who ask, as you just did.  You got your department looking good, the brother down there.  I ask him, you going to use that billy club?  Absolutely not.  First guy I see is Moot.  Would you walk down here with me, please?  Ah, but he's supposed to be on or off duty, officer.  So you knew who he was?  That's beside the point.  I need him to obey the rules, the same rules he enforces.  You knew who he was, correct?  I need him to obey his policy, correct?  Isn't that what you guys do, obey your policy?  Well, he was identified, correct?  He didn't identify himself.  That's just the policy.  Why are you finding excuses for him?  Would you please walk down?  He's right here.  He's right here, leaning in the truck.  How you doing, man?  You look like a nice cat, bro.  All right.  one more time excuse me moat when you got a second you see that.  you see what i'm saying.  you see him and you wonder why people don't like talks.  this is the reason bro the disdain for the average ordinary citizen.  okay I might hang around and wait for Moose to ID himself.  I might grow old.  I might get some more craze in this fucking beer waiting on this dude to ID himself.  What do you think?  You're a white shirt.  What do you think about that?  Would you identify yourself because you don't have a name tag on?  I don't have a name tag on.  I'm sorry.  I can't.  It's because... What did you say?  I said I don't know how to read.  And if I don't, will you obey?  No, I ain't got to do shit.  You ain't got to do shit, man.  Oh, I love you, baby.  I love you, too.  Ah, fucking internet superstar.  I ain't got to do shit, baby.  I sit on the title of the video.  I ain't got to do shit.  Rule 37 of your policy is the ID.  On or off duty.  When you don't even have a name to show it, you're still supposed to have the ID.  But you guys don't read your policy.  You know the first rule of your policy?  We shall obey all laws, baby.  We shall show respect for the average citizen.  In fact, if your buddies perceive you disrespectfully, they're supposed to write in a report.  They won't.  Could you move your black thing so I can see what you're... He says no.  Ah, O'Leary.  Excuse me, Sarge.  Excuse me, Sergeant O'Leary.  Excuse me.  You cast out nothing but disdain.  Y'all don't like us, do you?  Y'all don't dig us at all.  Y'all think we're the enemy.  And we're not.  I want the best for you.  I want you to go home in one piece.  But from 9 to 5, when you clock in, catch clock in, you guys are ridiculous.  Off the hook.  Don't even, don't, you do what the fuck you want.  Like you say, we don't have to, you know.  Excuse me, Sergeant O'Leary.  Can't hear me now?  Can't hear me?  O'Leary?  Excuse me, O'Leary.  O'Leary.  Can I speak with you for a moment?  I'm trying to get this guy Bonner here who had his name plate covered up to ID.  It seems to be an epidemic.  You're the only cop that IDs this professional around here?  Certainly the only white shirt.  You got some word for Muth and his disdain for the common citizen?  You wonder why people are protesting and rioting and worse?  This guy, no words for him, huh?  You check us, you don't check your own.  No, I mean, you as police, you don't check your own.  Move, not the chance that deep.  You're going to pass it up?  Chance to look good for your department.  You're going to pass it up?  Ah, you catch.  All right, have a good one.  All right.  That would be Officer... I do not ID Moot.  How you doing, man?  Nice to see some smiles out of you guys, man.  Your wife says you feel like they don't have to identify themselves.  What's that about?  Rule 37 of your policy, you know you guys ID, right?  My man, loving you, Johnson.  Be easy, baby.  Same, brother.  You be good.  Moot, you a dick.  You a dick, bro.  You a dick, Moot.  How you doing bro?  I'm alright.  How you doing bro?  At least the ladies look pleasant.  You guys have a good day.  You look like you enjoy yourself.  How you doing?  How you doing?  How you doing?  How you doing?  I'm all right.  Thanks for asking.  Oh, no, we can't have this, bro.  How you doing?  I'm all right.  Walking in horseshit.  How you doing, man?  I can't see your name badge.  Excuse me, officer, could you identify yourself?  Could you identify yourself?  Oh, sure.  I'm listening.  Yeah.  I'm listening.  Rule 37 of your policy.  On or off duty, I will identify myself.  Off duty, you don't even have a name badge.  You're supposed to identify yourself verbally.  What's my name?  You are setting a great example for you guys out here.  Hey, you're not curious why we are protesting, are we?  Are you?  You know why.  Because of cats like you, bro.  the disdain baby how you doing.  i'm walking around horse manure every where.  how you doing man you look like you just have a great sense of humor bro.  let it hit yourself.  careful good to meet you man.  oh wow how you gentlemen doing.  i love the beards.  damn it i can't grow one but uh i'll dig it anyway.  how you gentlemen doing sarge i can't get some of your white shirts that do themselves.  man how do you feel about that?  i can't get some of your sarge and some of your white shirts.  so i did it.  i beat themselves.  well that's on your chest I know that.  You're familiar with the policy.  rule 37, yeah?  You guys ID.  on or off duty?  Off duty, you don't even have a name badge.  You're supposed to identify verbally.

But weather don't change the fact that you don't.  you don't ask it to the people who pay your salary.  The weather ain't going to change that.  The weather ain't going to change the fact that we.  Yes.  And I ask you some simple like idea yourself and your ego won't allow you.  You said other guys aren't ideaing themselves.  Would you identify yourself?  Again, you fell ID, bro.  You fell ID.
