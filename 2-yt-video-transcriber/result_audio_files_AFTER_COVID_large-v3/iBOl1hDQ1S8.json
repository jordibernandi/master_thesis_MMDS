            "text": "But they're not, they're not saying it.  They might think it, but they're not saying it, though.  So, here we go right now, actually.  S1.  Cars that... Another one, got the AR.  He's the one with the gun.  That's crazy.  It's a nice little AR.  Well, maybe or maybe not.  Who knows?  Didn't catch him though.  How's it going, sir?  It's going good.  Can you talk to me?  I don't want to answer no questions, but it is going good, though.  Okay.  Is there a reason that you're out here recording stuff?  I don't want to answer any questions.  Can I have your name and badge number?  I'm having a conversation with you.  Understandable.  Okay.  And I'm asking... I see my name's on my uniform.  I understand that, but your name isn't.  My name is on the uniform.  You can see my name is on the uniform.  Very true.  Is there a reason that you're out here?  Could I have your name and badge number?  My last name is Pierce.  Gotcha.  My badge number is 11690.  Thank you for your cooperation.  Can I have your name and badge number?  My name is Seal19343.  Okay.  Thank you.  Thank you.  So we'll go back to the beginning question.  You're out here reporting.  I want to know, is there anything we can help you with?  I'm all good.  I'm all good where I'm at, just documenting and talking to you guys.  Okay, if it's not a police matter, I don't know if you can see the signs over here.  Can you see that sign?  Yeah.  What does that sign say?  You can tell me.  It says no trespassing, obviously.  Okay.  The thing about that no trespassing, unless I go in there.  Hold on, wait, wait.  Can you step at least six feet back?  At least six feet back, please.  Please.  Unless you have a police matter.  Can I get six feet back, please?  Why?  Because it's what's going on right now with COVID, obviously.  We're both wearing masks.  I'll step back.  Thank you, Pierce.  And is your body camera recording?  Yes, it is.  Is your body camera recording also, sir?  Thank you.  You see this area here?  Very true.  If you have a police matter.  Yeah, I do.  That's my question.  I've asked you several times.  Very true.  I don't need to answer that.  It is also my right to remain silent.  Is that right?  No.  That's not right.  That's a Miranda right.  It has nothing to do with a conversation.  So my right isn't my right until I'm arrested.  I can't even get your first name or to have a conversation with you.  Because I don't have to identify.  I didn't do a crime.  I asked you your first name.  I didn't ask you for your identification.  My name is Identify Me.  Your name is Identify Me.  Of course.  You can run after your database just as much as my face.  Here's what I'm going to say.  Okay.  If you don't have a police matter, I'm going to have to ask you to leave this area.  Are you trespassing me?  If you don't have a police matter, yes.  So I'm being trespassed?  If you have a police matter, what do you need from us?  Trust me, I just need to see if you guys protect our constitutional rights.  That's all I'm doing.  And honestly, kind of not because I'm doing my rights right now and you're questioning me about it.  Rachel.  I am doing my rights right now.  And if you question me about my rights or my rights look suspicious, that's the question about what's happening.  I have no idea what you mean by your rights.  look suspicious.  My First Amendment protected activity, I can record.  On public property, is this public property?  This here?  Yeah.  It's a city-owned property.  It's a city-owned property, funded by?  So if you have a police matter, that's what we're here to do.  It's this public property.  So you don't have anything you need questions or help with, right?  Can I have an answer on is this public property?  Okay, so you're not answering my questions.  I am answering your questions.  I mean, it's your policy to answer my questions.  I don't have to answer your questions.  I'm a private citizen.  Okay.  I'm honest.  Do you want to stay here with the channel for a second?  That's cool.  That's cool.  Why are you going to stay here with me?  Because the sergeant had asked me to do so.  Okay.  If you don't have a police matter, you are trespassing.  Do you just follow orders even though it's constitutionally protected?  There's a sign over here that says no trespassing.  So, am I trespassing because I'm on the opposite side of the sign?  You are on private property.  I'm on private property.  This is city-owned property.  City-owned property.  Okay.  So who funded this?  The people who doesn't fund this, correct?  This is city-owned property.  And you get paid by?  And you get paid by?  I get paid by the city.  You get paid by the city.  that's funded through?  Funded through who?  Who is it funded through?  Wow.  You guys don't know?  Do you know the oath that you sworn to protect?  Yes.  Can you recite it?  I'm not going to reset it.  You don't have to.  But the thing is, the rights that you sworn to protect, you should know those before you kind of just come up to people.  I do.  That's good.  Just like any other private person.  So is this protected?  What I'm doing is protected.  Is it protected under the Constitution?  If you're not going to allow me to speak, then I'm not going to answer your questions.  We'll just stand here and sign off.  No, I'm allowing you to speak.  You're asking me to let you speak.  You keep interrupting me.  Continue.  You've interrupted me several times.  Continue, I'm sorry.  Okay, this is not public property.  Okay.  That is why there are no trespassing signs.  This is city-owned property.  Just like any other business.  This is public property.  Any other private property.  Mm-hmm.  They can put up no trespassing signs.  Mm-hmm.  And not allow people to trespass.  So this is privately owned.  Privately owned by who?  The city, you said.  The city.  This is not public property.  This sidewalk is publicly owned.  This sidewalk is on the private property.  On the city's property.  Private property owned by the city, but it is private property.  But it is private property.  Are you sure that this concrete is public easement right here?  It's private property.  It's not a public easement.  Gotcha.  So how am I able to be back here without trespassing?  If there wasn't no sign said don't trespass this parking lot.  That is for the gate.  Caution, automatic gate.  No trespassing.  You guys should get that right, man, before you get to arresting someone that literally knows their rights.  Who's arresting anyone?  I said not me.  I don't believe I'm going to get arrested because I know my rights.  I'm just saying that.  If you guys approach someone that does know their rights and you guys think that you are doing the right thing, that's going out for you guys.  That's bad for you guys.  Correct.  You're standing out here outside of a police station.  Right.  A lot of times people come to the police station when they need help.  Very true.  It happens all the time.  Very true.  And so when we see people out here in the parking lot.  Mm-hmm.  We come to see if they need help.  That's cool.  That was the first thing that we asked you, is if you needed help.  But the thing that's... You need our assistance with anything.  Okay.  Okay?  That's why we're contacting you.  Okay.  You said you do not need our help with anything.  Correct.  So you guys are dismissed and you guys can leave and help someone who needs to be helped.  Because I don't need it.  Because also, this department doesn't need it because I'm not trespassing.  And you guys know that.  Honestly.  I understand the rules behind trespassing once you get past the gates.  Thank you.  Once I get past the gates.  You heard what he said?  So that sign, it does not apply to me until I cross the gate.  Correct?  Do you think it's unusual that someone just stands there?  Ah, very true.  Very true.  But we can't go just off suspicion of it's unusual.  We still have to figure out the facts and we still have to have our ticket.  Which is what we're talking about.  Very true, very true.  But to say that I'm trespassing because of the sign that's on there for the gate, that is not talking, that's antagonizing, and you guys are trying to get me off your property.  Yes, the gate is trespassing.  Thank you, but right here, yes, but right here isn't.  You said I was trespassing right here.  If you guys say I'm trespassing right here, that's just being antagonistic very much.  Listen, it's not my intention to be antagonistic to you.  I don't think it is.  I just want to find out what you're doing here.  That's fine, that's fine.  Clearly, your purpose for being here... To document, to document, no, I never met you, so I didn't think, let me go record Pierce.  I can't, I never met you, so my purpose, I'm just saying, my purpose couldn't be to let me go find Mr.  Pierce today and record him, because I never met you.  So I came out to see if my First Amendment... It's protected by you guys, sworn oath takers.  And that's why I'm here.  It wasn't to meet you.  I could have met anyone.  It wasn't to meet you also.  I'm glad I did meet you too.  Because it could be somebody who's not like you guys.  And literally say that that's illegal.  And try to arrest me.  And it's going to go through a whole... Thank you.  And I'm glad to hear you guys say that.  Thank you.  Thank you.  You guys have a lovely day.  Or the BMW motorcycle.  That's pretty sweet.  That is nice.  So you guys carrying semi-automatics?  It is a semi-automatic.  Semi-automatic.  How you get that hosted up there, man?  That's pretty sweet.  How you get that hosted up there like that?  That's pretty sweet.  Couldn't get his car too much.  That's Sergeant right there.  So you like riding a motorcycle?  I do.  That's nice.  That's nice.  There's no potholes or anything out here, so you should have a good time.  Sorry, I couldn't hear you.  What?  There's no potholes or anything out here, so you guys should have a good time on this.  It's nice.  Hey, man, thank you for respecting my constitutional rights, and you have a good day.  Thank you.  Thank you. ",
