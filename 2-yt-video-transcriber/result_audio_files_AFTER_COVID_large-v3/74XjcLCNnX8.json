Like this little room right here?  Yeah.  Okay.  So that would be a secret room.  All right.  So if you guys are gutting a house or building a new house, you could frame in a NATO safe so you don't get hit by the bullets or the tornadoes.  okay i've got a five by seven right here.  it's about uh seven feet tall and it's five feet wide seven feet long.  it's got the submarine door on it of course and it's got the port hole so you could always open it from the outside.  and uh so i got this one.  okay that's all i have.  all i got to do is uh blast it and paint it and put a set of beds in there for you and you could either pick it up or I could arrange to have it delivered.  I had them.  blast your NATO safe.  See the vault holes around the edges?  Get it nice and clean.  Got to put the tubing on the wall for the bed brackets.  Oh, you got the tubings on the wall? ",

He doesn't want an air system in this because he's going to use it just as a safe room and for some guns.  It's going to be framed into the house, like in the drawing we did.  Thank you.  Now you see why we put lifting eyes on the corners.  So it comes in handy.  It's gonna go right there.  Hey, I'm going to pick it up, pick it up and clear the trailer and pull this tailgate out so he can pull out from under it. ",

All right, it's moving.  That's all right.  How's that?  Roll it out about here.  That's good.  Okay, go ahead and let her down, Brandon.  Once this one pops out, we'll throw that.  You got another pipe over there we can throw up front?  Okay, keep going, keep going.  Now, you can raise it up, that pry bar, or put up some blocks, push down on the pry bar, or you raise it up enough to get the dollies out.  Whoa.  You got lucky.  This thing fits perfect, don't it?
