But for some reason, not even understood by himself, he thinks that the plane is moving in the direction of that green arrow at 1,200 miles per hour.  Now in reality, when the plane is traveling in the direction indicated by that red arrow, it will have a horizontal and vertical component.  And both of those speeds will be less than 300 miles per hour.  And in fact, it's actually relatively simple high school trigonometry that will allow us to calculate what both of those x and y components are.

So, you know, when you get down here and you're trying to line up with the runway, you're still, you're going 300 miles per hour towards it.  Make that look a little better.  And you've got VP prime here, but you also have VPE prime.  Well, there's a real problem there because the airport, the ground over here, is moving, you can see that, at 900 miles per hour.
