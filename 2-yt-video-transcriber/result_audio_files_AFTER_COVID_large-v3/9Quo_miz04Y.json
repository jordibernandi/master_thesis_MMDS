While it's almost funny watching all of this delusional insanity, these people are spreading a tremendous amount of misinformation to millions of people and it's tearing this nation apart.

Because if I can break free from over two decades of this dogma, then maybe I can help expose the problems of it to others.  Me and my team do this full-time with support from viewers like you.
