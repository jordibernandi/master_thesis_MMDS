Sheep, wolves, and sheepdogs.  Most of us are sheep, in a good way.  We just want to get on with our lives.  We want to live in peace, and we don't want to hurt nor disturb the pasture.  And then there are the wolves, who prey upon the sheep without mercy, the violent criminals, the murderers, who have no interest in peace, but instead, destruction and savagery.  Luckily for the flock, there are the sheepdog.  Those who have dedicated their lives to defending the herd, to maintaining order and harmony.  And for a long time, that's what's happened.  Yes, there have been sheepdog who have gone rogue, who have stepped out of line and done the unthinkable.  But almost always, they were immediately removed from the pack.  But what happens when the sheep start to feel the sheepdogs are indistinguishable from the wolves, writing them off entirely with their shaggy hides, sharp teeth, low growl, and vicious bite?  What happens when the relationship between our citizenry and those we have entrusted to keep us safe collapses?  It's undeniable.  our world is at a crossroads. ",

And what does the data actually tell us about these issues we are debating?  From the heart of broken communities who demand change, to the violent activists raging in the streets, to the nightly patrols with officers risking their lives and the deadly consequences.
