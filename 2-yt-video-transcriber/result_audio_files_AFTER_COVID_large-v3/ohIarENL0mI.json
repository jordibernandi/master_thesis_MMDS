            "text": "What is up, everybody?  A quick breaking boom right now, where we now have a definite connection with Bill Clinton and Epstein Island.  This was just unsealed, and this is a conversation that Virginia Roberts, now Virginia Giffrey, had with her lawyers, Brad Edwards and Jack Scarola.  And this is back in 2011.  And in the bottom here.  Jack tells Virginia that he has just a few other follow-up things that I want to ask you.  And again, if these questions are questions that you're uncomfortable responding to, then don't hesitate to tell me that.  Do you have any recollection of Jeffrey Epstein specifically telling you that Bill Clinton owes me favors?  Virginia, yes, I do.  All right, so they had stuff on Clinton then.  It was a laugh, though.  He would laugh it off.  You know, I remember asking Jeffrey, what's Bill Clinton doing here, kind of thing.  And he laughed it off and said, well, he owes me a favor.  He never told me what the favors were.  I never knew.  I didn't know if he was serious.  It was just a joke.  Where was here?  He told me a long time ago that everyone owes him favors.  They're all in each other's pockets.  When you say you asked him, why is Bill Clinton here?  Where was here?  On the island.  Bill Clinton on the island.  It gets better.  You ready?  When you were present with Jeffrey Epstein and Bill Clinton on the island, who else was there?  galane emmy and there was two young girls that i could identify.  i never really knew them well anyway.  i guess maybe she meant i couldn't identify.  it was just two girls from new york and all of you were staying at jeffrey's house on the island including bill clinton.  that's correct.  he had about four or five different villas on his island separate from the main house and we all stayed in.  the villas were sexual orgies a regular occurrence on the island at jeffrey's house yes.  So Bill Clinton on the island and not with a whole bunch of people, just with a few where it seems like they were about to have orgies with two young girls.  Wow.  That is some damning stuff.  And if you remember Bill Clinton, he never said anything until finally in 2019, just like all of them.  And that is something I'm going to go over in a video that I'm premiering at two o'clock today that I hope you guys won't miss.  I've been working on it for a couple of weeks.  As a lot of you know, is a quick little peek at all the tracks.  And this is why sometimes it takes me three weeks to make a video.  But, yeah, there's a lot of stuff packed into this one.  And you're not going to miss it.  And that's at 2 o'clock.  I just wanted to jump on really quick to show you this.  And, of course, this comes out right as I finish this video.  This would have been perfect to put in it.  But Bill Clinton, he cannot be a happy guy today.  See you guys at 2. ",
