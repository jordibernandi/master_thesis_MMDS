            "text": "Morgan's own church leaders could also use that Bible verse against her.  They could watch her YouTube videos and say, Hey girl, a woman is meek and gentle in spirit.  You need to lower your voice.  Women in my church were told this and it was hurtful because they were made to be something different.  Hi, beautiful people.  First and foremost, I want to address the most obvious fact.  We are all shooting up.  I'm outside shooting just to give my family a little space and to be out in the fresh air.  And I want to know, how are you feeling?  Because on my healthiest best days, I'm like, wow, what a privilege and honor to have all this undivided time and attention to put into my newborn baby.  And other times I'm like, This is fine.  And I have to thank the God is Gray community from the bottom of my heart.  Many of you know that YouTube is not really a sustainable income for a lot of us, especially when we're talking about sex and all these salacious subjects.  All of you that are supporting God is Gray on Patreon, I cannot thank you enough.  I honestly have no idea where I'd be without you.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  I'm doing my best to shop at local restaurants, to get coffee from local places, anything I can do to support my community.  I know that a lot of us are experiencing this macro level trauma where we're worried about people losing homes, people losing livelihoods and businesses, people losing family members or getting sick.  Those are the things touching us universally on this global scale.  Then there's also loss on a micro level for each of us.  Maybe you were looking forward to prom your entire high school career and all of a sudden that's no longer happening.  The humility to look at other people's pain and realize, you know what, they have it worse than me.  I don't have it so bad.  That is a positive thing and that is a beautiful attitude to take.  However, I want to remind you that you're not only allowed to, but it is important to address whatever it is you may be feeling.  Maybe the prom is not a big deal.  Maybe it was a really big deal to you.  In Christianity, we're often taught to pray away our fears and our disappointment.  And then if the pain or fear doesn't flee, Then it's because of our lack of faith.  We didn't pray hard enough.  We didn't trust God enough.  This is not the way God sees our emotional well-being and our lives.  Ecclesiastes 3, 1-11 says, For everything.  there is a season, and a time for every matter under heaven, a time to be born and a time to die, a time to break down and a time to build up, a time to weep and a time to laugh, a time to mourn and a time to dance.  In Ecclesiastes, the author is acknowledging that life is a roller coaster.  If you shove those things down, those things that are hurting you, that you do have to mourn, they will sit in there.  They'll continue to hurt you.  So let them out there.  That'll be the excavation of your spirit.  And from there, I encourage embodiment.  This is realizing.  your body is going to be feeling everything in this moment as well.  Whatever happens to you emotionally, feeling that claustrophobia, feeling tired of the people you're around or exhausted by not working, that's the moment to bring your body into it.  Go out and run around the block.  Go and have a dance party in your bedroom all by yourself.  God calls us to honor our bodies and this is an opportunity to do so.  And the honoring of our bodies includes recognizing our emotions and working through them as they come up.  All that said, I do want to talk about something quite heavy today.  So when I first caught wind of this Jacqueline Glenn, Paul and Morgan drama, my initial thought was, no, I am not touching that with a 40 foot pole.  All of them can talk about this.  I am staying out of it.  But as I watched the back and forth, I realized that this is actually a good opportunity to address this thing that's been weighing so heavily on me.  And that is the subject of abuse.  There is abuse, both physical and emotional in secular homes, of course, right?  But when abuse is religiously motivated or biblically justified, that can be so, so difficult because the abuser is not saying, Hey, I'm doing this to you.  The abuser is saying, I'm doing this to you.  because god permits me to there are two particular forms of abuse that are religiously motivated religiously justified that i want to talk about today.  the first of course is lgbtq children teens young adults trapped in non-affirming households.  so today i have a very important podcast for any of you in that situation.  as a preteen nate postal weight was manipulated into a relationship with a much older predator and his church's response was that he had to repent for his quote sin of homosexuality.  From there, Nate endured over a decade of gay conversion therapy, which led to extreme overeating, self-hatred and suicidal ideation.  But now Nate is a life coach and survivor walking alongside others towards their healing.  If you are an LGBTQ person trapped in a household with people that tell you you are a sinner, that you are inherently wrong for the way that you are, the way God made you, I want to make sure that God is Gray is providing resources for you.  I love you.  The God is Great community loves you and I affirm you as an LGBTQ person.  Please search the God is Great podcast on Apple, Google, Spotify, and more for this touching conversation with Nate Postaway.  I will also link below information on how to contact the Trevor Project, Freed Hearts, Kevin Garcia, and more.  in case you need to reach out to people who will help you through this time.  That said, our focus today is going to be on the second form of abuse.  Wives or girlfriends being manipulated or abused due to Ephesians 5.22.  Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands as you do to the Lord.  My brother actually brought up a great point to me today, which is that 50 years ago, even 20 years ago, people would raise a hand to their child, backhand them, and it was socially acceptable.  In religious communities, that sort of behavior was justified, again, by Bible verses.  Proverbs 13, 24, he who spares the rod hates his son, but the one who loves their children is careful to discipline them.  Marital rape wasn't even criminalized until 1993.  Nowadays, we recognize the clear harm of physical abuse.  But there are still Christians out there that are promoting these ideas and letting these abusive behaviors linger, like the transformed wife.  One woman wrote me and asked me if her husband had raped her because she had told him she didn't want to have sex.  She woke up in the middle of night, he was having sex with her, so she wanted to know if that was marital rape.  Through rape, is when you're assaulted against your will by some stranger.  And biblical gender roles, which is so off base, it's not even worth my breath.  Moving on.  Thank God that our society, and for the most part, our churches, no longer accept this.  That's called the Holy Spirit moving the church forward.  But the next beast to slay is our inaccurate representations of male-female dynamics and the way we're still misinterpreting Ephesians 5.22.  And this all ties in to the Jacqueline Glenn, Paul and Morgan drama.  Here is the tea.  Jacqueline released a video called Morgan Needs Help, Why Paul is Toxic.  And Morgan released a response.  Watching both these videos gave me anxiety, to be honest.  I was kind of absentmindedly making dinner, watching Jacqueline's video, and I thought, okay, that's interesting.  She's making a pretty interesting case for her point. ",

Wait, this is all online and now it looks like Morgan is hurt.  Hey guys, it's Morgan.  I love Jacqueline.  Y'all know we are friends.  But the question became, should she have put her suspicions on blast for everyone to see?  Or should she have reached out to Morgan one-on-one?  My first thought was, yes, definitely.  She should have just reached out to Morgan.  But Jacqueline made a final video to explain why she said this publicly. ",

I was defensive.  I was like, how dare someone that doesn't know me judge my relationship.  But my neighbor was right.  And that part I said about Morgan being strong and tenacious was not to imply that you're weak.  if you end up in an abusive situation.  I too was strong and tenacious, but there I was, being gaslit, being hurt.  Abusers do not slap you across the face on a first date.  My ex had built up to his level of abuse so slowly that I didn't even recognize it until I was out of it.  All said, this is my personal story.

And y'all, Morgan is a brilliant singer.  She's vibrant and captivating.  I love these old videos of her.  In certain churches, people are steered away from secular careers and told that if they have a talent that's creative, they need to just pour all of that into a spiritual career.  Hollywood is vilified as demonic and I truly don't know if that is what's happened here or if Morgan genuinely wanted to wash her hands clean and no longer pursue a career in secular music.

When human beings in their finite minds pluck Bible verses out of context and use them to subjugate or manipulate others.  Morgan's own church leaders could also use that Bible verse against her.  They could watch her YouTube videos and say, Hey girl, a woman is meek and gentle in spirit.  You need to lower your voice.  Women in my church were told this.
