            "text": "Hi everyone, Lisa Haven here, and I've got an emergency alert to share with you guys.  Well, Nancy Pelosi has just made the statement that she is going to use continuity of government martial law to remove President Trump from office and put herself as the new president of the United States of America, no joke.  And I'm going to prove it to you here in a moment.  But as a quick reminder, please don't forget to check out my partner at glowwithlisa.com.

            "text": "Whether he knows it yet or not, he will be leaving.  Just because he might not want to move out of the White House doesn't mean we won't have an inauguration ceremony to inaugurate a duly elected president of the United States.  I'm second in line to the presidency, and just last week I had my... regular continuation of government briefing.  This might interest you because I say to them, this is never going to happen.  God willing, it never will.  But there is a process.  It has nothing to do with it.  The certain occupant of the White House doesn't feel like moving and has to be fumigated out of there because the presidency is the presidency.  It's not geography or location. ",

            "text": "The audacity of that woman and the things that are coming out of her mouth.  You can really see how happy she was when she was talking about it.  She's all smiles.  And then she has the audacity to say, I'm second in line, so I will become president.  Was that just like, you know, some kind of oopsie slip?  I get.  maybe she meant... Second, first the VP, then her.  But I don't think she meant that.  I think she meant President Trump and then her.  That would be second in line.  But in reality, she's not second in line.  That would be the vice president, Mike Pence.  But did you see how giddy and how happy she was talking about, will we move the president whether he knows it or not?  And we'll use continuity of government martial law to do it.  And I know she's talking about the fact that removing him if he refuses to leave, but then she added the continuity of government part.  That's removing a sitting president.  This is a little bit sheepish here, what she's doing.  Let me show you what continuity of government is if you haven't seen it.  And this is on whitehouse.gov and it's under continuity of government 2020.  And here's what it says right under the words.  This is on whitehouse.gov, the shadow government, it states, Following a catastrophic national emergency, the president or his successors can authorize the establishment of a temporary shadow government to maintain control of the essential functions of the federal government.  Bush activated this shadow government on September 11, 2001, shortly after the second attack on the World Trade Centers.  Every federal agency was designated key individuals to be part of an emergency relocation group.  The ERGs are assigned to an alternative secure location on a rotating basis and are ready to take over the duty of supporting the national essential functions of this nation in an emergency.  In other words, when they implement continuity of government in the short run, right, you reallocate who is in charge of what and the president goes underground or vice president goes underground, they go into command centers, but as they state, a shadow government is ruling the country and that would include Nancy Pelosi, right?  The audacity of that woman.  to say something like that.  They tried with Russia, they tried with Ukraine, they tried with Stormy Daniels, and now they're trying with the freaking pandemic.  And if the pandemic doesn't work, they're going to say, well, continuity of government, we're gonna declare that under this pandemic and take out the president.  Somebody needs to arrest her.  You know what's terrifying?  She's already starting to talk about voter fraud from the election, and they're gonna do it.  That's why they're all for mail-in ballots, because masses amount of fraud can happen.  So unless President Trump wins by, I don't know, five, six, maybe even 10% more than the Democrat candidate.  It's hard to win because there's literally that much fraud going on.  But I think we may have it.  Here it is, npr.org, Pelosi Democrats cite election interference and request from info from the FBI.  Why not?  It's the cliche go-to thing by the Democrats.  When this doesn't work, this doesn't work, this doesn't work, release the pandemic, release the riots, and hey, continuity of government and voter fraud.  I'm so tired of all these dealings.  I'm so tired, not to mention of the censorship.  Anyone who is pro-President Trump gets labeled a xenophobic, bigot, racist, Nazi.  Why?  When we're not any of the following.  But because of our political stance, we're gonna resort to name calling and false accusations?  And then organizations like your Twitter and your Facebook and your social media giants are removing us from their platforms?  Silencing us so we can't talk?  That's mass voter fraud on a scale that we have never seen before.  And Google is involved along with many others on the internet.  And I know I sidetracked just a little bit, but that's what we're faced with.  Is America going to wake up anytime soon?  Today?  Now is the day.  Now is the day.  Not tomorrow.  This is an emergency alert.  And Trump needs to start doing more.  I'm just going to say he needs to grow some balls, if you will, and start doing something.
