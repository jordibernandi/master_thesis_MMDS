            "text": "So for a while now, Donald Trump has been questioning the mental acuity of his opponent, Joe Biden.  He's called him sleepy, he said he's forgetful, and he said that he's not up for the job.  The thing is that Biden is old.  He's 77, which means that if he won, he'd be the oldest president ever to be inaugurated.  The current oldest?  Well, that's Trump.  So if he wins in November, Trump will be the oldest person to ever win a presidential election.  So we have two older gentlemen, And while we don't have many older viewers, I'm not looking to insult everyone over the age of 65 because we all know older people who are perfectly with it and more than capable of holding high office.  The thing is that Trump's jumped on this argument hard and is really selling himself as the only person capable of actually doing the job.  In an attempt to prove this, the president has recently taken to boasting about a test he took.  A test which he says proves he's capable of running the country. ",

            "text": "So we thought we'd put it to the test.  How well can the TLDR team do at this test?  So yesterday I put two of our employees to the test.  If they pass, I'll give them a rather lovely t-shirt proclaiming their victory.  If they don't, they're fired and we'll have to try and hire Trump instead.  By the way, if you want to pick up one of these t-shirts or any of our other designs, they're all linked in the store below.  Before we get to the test itself, let's discuss the wider issue.  Because while this might have all become a bit of a circus, it's a very real question.  The president clearly holds vast amounts of power, not only diplomatically and militarily, but also as the leader of 328 million people.  So while it might not feel very serious when two old guys argue about it on Fox News, this is a really important issue.  We all need our leaders to be capable and competent.  Were it true that Trump or Biden was lacking in mental faculties, it would genuinely be a problem.  After all, the presidency is not an easy job.  It's often described as the most stressful job in the world.  And there's a reason for that.  The president has to be able to make quick decisions on matters that could alter the lives of thousands, if not millions of people.  In a time of international crisis like we're living through right now, this is even more important.  One wrong step could result in countless deaths.  As such, Trump has made a central part of his campaign strategy attacking Biden's mental acuity and his ability to handle the duties of president.  And to be fair, Biden does have a tendency of tripping over his words and go on rambling stories which don't exactly help his case.  But of course, the presidency is about a lot more than just giving speeches, and Biden's eight years as vice president certainly gives some degree of credit to his sanity.  But really, at this point, most speculation about each candidate's mental capacity is just that, speculation.  And that's because there's no universally accepted method of determining a candidate's intellectual capacity.  This, it seems, was a problem Trump seemed determined to remedy, which brings us back to the test itself.  The test itself is the MOCA or Montreal Cognitive Assessment.  The purpose of the test is to screen for potential mental illnesses usually brought on by old age.  The website claims that the test is an effective tool for identifying diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, ALS and various other ailments which could result in cognitive decline.  it measures things like language comprehension spatial and temporal orientation and of course short-term memory the final of those leading to the now famous or arguably infamous person woman camera tv moment.  and while the president may have somewhat overstated what an accomplishment passing the test is he is fully correct in his assertion that passing the test is good.  No matter your political orientation, I think we can all agree that the last thing 2020 needs is a president with early signs of dementia.  So basically, the test is meant to screen for cognitive decline, not analyze the specific intellectual capacity of the person taking it.  Still, it is good for a president to be able to pass it.  So, now we know what the test is and why it's important, we have three very serious caveats to make before proceeding.  Firstly, the website and the test itself repeatedly state that the test is only meant to be conducted by medical professionals, which, spoiler alert, I'm not.  Secondly, the test isn't really meant for people like Trump, Biden, and that reporter, so it's certainly not intended for our staff who are in their early 20s.  Thirdly, this test isn't a game, and failing it isn't like failing a quiz show.  And like any other medical test or screening, it's designed to diagnose medical conditions, and not passing the test isn't funny or a failure in any way.  Regardless, I thought it'd be interesting to spring this test on them, see how they did, and if nothing else, it's a more interesting way of walking you through the format than just reading through it in a video.  Oh, and the TLDI US team were just waking up when we recorded this, so I'm testing it with TLDI UK, and I've merged together the two tests into one. ",
