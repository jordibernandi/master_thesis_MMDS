You can either go on stage or not go on stage.  You could only fail or succeed.  And I say, I would tell him to take To not have failure be an option and just don't look back, look forward and just keep digging.  In the late 90s, I get a message from somebody saying, hey, I have this idea, me and my producing partner, and we'd like to come and see you.  And they finally got the producing partner to come and see me.  It was Sandra Bullock.  So Sandra Bullock came to see me at an improv out here.  Then afterwards she came backstage and she said, you know, I had an idea for a show, but it was more about the teenagers.  But after seeing you, I kind of want to kind of go down that road.  You know, your grandmother sounds crazy or, you know, the way you grew up sounds wild.  And, uh, um, So I met with her and then we went down the road.  She had just been doing Miss Congeniality and she had lost her mother.  So she was in a place where she was a little bit disillusioned by Hollywood after losing somebody so close to her.  And when she saw me, she said that, She saw somebody who just had so much spirit and was so willing to do anything that was required to show somebody.  they were funny.  So she kind of became like my fairy godmother and somebody can only take you so far and then you have to take yourself the rest of the way.  But, you know, she gave me an opportunity and I was always ready when the opportunity presented itself.  And I've never told anybody this, but at the end of the first season, uh, they do like a retrospective of the whole year and then they put all the, like the people who have been on the show and all the, wow, all the guest stars in the clip.  and the last clip is her and I standing next to each other and I look at her and she looks at me and I just, Just went like that.  And you could see the appreciation.  You could see the respect and the love in just that one moment.  You could see how much I appreciated her and how much I loved her for believing in me. ",
