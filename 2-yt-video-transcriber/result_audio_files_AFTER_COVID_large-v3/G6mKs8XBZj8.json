            "text": "Follow the locals.  This guy's crossing.  I'm going to cross.  Follow the local people.  He's not scared at all.  He's not scared at all.  This guy's a ballsy.  That's how you cross the Xinjiang.  That's how you cross the damn street.  Up ahead I see a security guard or a police officer.  I think they're just chatting.  I don't think there's any problems here.  Just a little chat.  They're all over here though.  They're all over here.  so as you can see guys not really an open air prison as the western media likes to say.  it's more of a of a nice city with beautiful women walking around and people wearing their traditional clothes in a modern city, so it's pretty amazing.  And kids going to school.  This is a work day.  So today's Wednesday, May 7th or 6th, May 6th, I think.  I'm not sure.  I can't remember the exact day.  But that's why there's so many people walking around on the street right now.  Yeah.  It's a work day, so everyone's finishing up work right now.  And yeah, wow, it's like all Uyghur people right now.  There's like no Han Chinese people in this area.  Not sure why.  And I have my cameras in Osmo Pocket.  It's super small.  And I'm angling it.  I'm angling it in such a way that it kind of looks like a phone right now.  It kind of looks like I'm looking down at my phone.  But my camera is actually pointing out.  That's why no one has any idea that I'm filming them right now.  So you're getting this amazing secret view of Urumqi because no one has any idea that I'm recording.  Again, I'm going to show you a bus stop in Ulumichi, Xinjiang, how they do it to protect themselves.  It's not a real protection, I'm going to be honest.  I mean, they don't really check my bag.  They look at my face.  They think, you know, I look like a Han Chinese.  I'm not going to terrorize anyone.  I'm not going to cause an attack.  So they don't scan my bag.  I've only had one person open my bag.  I think she was just doing it for fun.  But otherwise, they don't... They don't really care that much.  They're just standing there getting paid their nice government salary.  Look at these people wearing their beautiful traditional clothes.  So nice.  So yeah, they don't really check anything.  Oh, there's one Han Chinese person here.  And again, as you can see, there's a guard.  She's like a security guard, I think.  They're usually... Yeah, they're usually Uyghurs and stuff.  Yeah, usually the police and the guards are Uyghurs.  Like this one right here.  Coming up on the right-hand side.  And no one really cared.  I mean, I think one security guard saw that this was a camera and she didn't really care.  Yeah.  What a nice day.  It's a beautiful day today.  It's about 12 degrees outside.  It's a little bit cloudy.  But what a beautiful tree-lined area.  I mean, you find this in so many Chinese cities.  That's what I love about Chinese cities.  Tree-lined streets.  And when you ride a bicycle through it or just walk through it, it's so comfortable.  And you just can't get this in a lot of cities.  You do not get this in Toronto at all.  There are no areas... There are no areas like this in Toronto.  I can't think of one.  Okay, if you go to the suburbs, yeah, if you go to the suburbs... A little bit?  Not really, no.  Because the trees are on people's property, so you don't get... It's not as covered as this.  The foliage isn't as intense as this.  There are a lot of trees in the suburbs where I grew up.  So it is pretty pleasant to walk around.  But look at the street.  This is a major street.  This is a major city street with buses and tons of traffic.  This is not a suburb, okay?  But it's totally tree-lined, and I love it.  So as I'm filming all these beautiful Uyghur people, because that's what you guys want to see, I'm also getting this beautiful street.  Wow.  Beautiful traditional Uyghur clothing there.  And here's another Uyghur man coming up.  Maybe I can stop someone for a quick interview.  I don't know, it feels kind of weird.  just stopping random people on the street and shoving a camera in their face.  It's pretty uncomfortable.  It's better just to film them walking around like this.  As you can see, with those two women, they look like Greek or something.  You know what I mean?  Like, they look very European.  So that's the coolest thing about Xinjiang.  It's the old Silk Road.  It's where people have lived for thousands of years, trading.  They came here to trade, trade goods and to offer hospitality to all the people that were trading along the route.  Just so much business and commerce flowing over this vast area of Central Asia, Western China.  And what drove.  it was the silk trade.  China was the only country in the world to have silk.  for probably thousands of years.  They didn't figure out the secret until much later.  When did you lose weight?  When did you lose weight?  Today?  How much is a kilo?  How old are you?  63.  How old are you?  63.  63.  Oh, 63.  Yes.  How old are you?  1.5 years old.  1.5 years old.  Okay.  Let me see.  And that is the Uyghur way to butcher a lamb.  That is the Uyghur way of doing it.  And it only costs 62 yuan for one kilogram.  That is so cheap.  That's $10, about $12 Canadian for a kilogram of fresh lamb.  Right there.  So that's the price.  I think it's pretty good, right?  $10 for fresh.  They just slaughtered that lamb.  Or the goat, or whatever.  So here are some women crossing the street.  Of course, weaker women, you can tell.  They look like Europeans.  And the cool thing about China is you can walk on the street.  Like I'm walking on the street right now, no one cares.  It's such a casual... Okay, well, he cares a little bit.  He honked at me.  But no one really cares.  It's like getting a VPN in China.  Nobody really cares.  You're not supposed to have a VPN, but if you have one, you're not hurting anybody.  You're not spreading massive gossip around.  Because spreading misinformation is against the law. ",
