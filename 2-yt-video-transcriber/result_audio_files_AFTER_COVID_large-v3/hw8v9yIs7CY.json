            "text": "In deep sadness, because, you know, I've been trying to bear witness for over 53 years, telling the truth and trying to say something about the least of these.  But I think we are witnessing this.  America as a failed social experiment.  And what I mean by that is that the history of black people for over 200 and some years in America has been looking at America's failure.  Its capitalist economy could not generate and deliver in such a way that people could live lives of decency.  The nation state, its criminal justice system, its legal system could not generate protection of rights and liberties.  And now our culture, of course, is so market-driven, everybody for sale, everything for sale, it can't deliver the kind of really real nourishment for soul, for meaning, for purpose.  And so when you get this perfect storm of all of these multiple failures at these different levels of the American empire, and Martin King already told us about that.  When I saw those pictures there in Atlanta, You can see Martin right there in Atlanta saying, I told you about militarism.  I told you about poverty.  I told you about materialism.  I told you about racism and all of its forms, whatever forms it takes.  I told you about xenophobia.  And what we've seen in America is now these chickens coming home to roost.  You're reaping what you sow.  And in this instant, you have Brother George.  where it is so clear.  it is a lynching process.  at the highest level.  Nobody can deny it.  And I thank God that we have people in the streets.  Can you imagine this kind of lynching taking place?  and people are indifferent?  People don't care.  People are callous.  You have just a few people out there with signs.  I recall the moments in which during the Reagan years, there was a few of us out there.  In the 60s, you had masses out there.  Now you've got a younger generation of all of these different colors and genders and sexual orientations saying, we won't take it any longer.  But you know what's sad about it though, brother, at the deepest level?  It looks as if the system cannot reform itself.  We've tried black faces in high places.  Too often, our black politicians, professional class, middle class, become too accommodated to the capitalist economy, too accommodated to the militarized nation state, too accommodated to the market-driven culture tied with celebrity status, power, fame, all of that superficial stuff that means so much to so many fellow citizens.  And what happens?  What happens is we got a neo-fascist gangster in the White House who really doesn't care for the most part.  You got a neoliberal wing of the Democratic Party that is now in the driver's seat with the collapse of Brother Bernie, and they don't really know what to do, because all they want is show more black faces, show more black faces.  But oftentimes, these black faces are losing legitimacy too, because the Black Lives Matter movement emerged under a black president, black attorney general, and black Homeland Security, and they couldn't deliver, you see?  So that when you talk about the masses of black people, the precious poor and working class black people, poor and working class, brown, red, yellow, whatever color, they're the ones who are left out and they feel so thoroughly powerless, helpless, hopeless.  Then you get rebellion.  and we've reached the point.  now it's a choice between non-violent revolution and by revolution what i mean is the democratic sharing of power resources wealth and respect.  if we don't get that kind of sharing you're going to get more violent explosions.  now the sad thing is in this neofascist moment in the white house you've got some neofascist brothers and sisters out there who are already armed.  they show up there at the u.s capitol and they don't get arrested they don't get put down.

            "text": "You're probably never going to hear these words come out of my mouth ever again.  But here we go.  Credit to CNN for having on Cornel West because that was brilliant.  Very well said.  So let's go through it here.  I like when he said our system doesn't nourish the soul and give us purpose.  I think that.  There's got to be.  one of the main reasons why people are out there is because they're really mad about what happened with George Floyd.  They want to address police brutality.  But it also goes beyond that in that our system does keep us atomized and fractured.  And... you see people coming together for something greater than them.  So it's... Our system doesn't give us purpose.  People are creating their own purpose now and caring about something bigger than them.  And it also is a manifestation of the pain and the misery and the degradation and the poverty that's out there.  And Cornel West says... Militaryism, poverty, materialism, racism, like the way our system is built.  This was the logical conclusion.  And then the thing that sets him apart from other commentators is that he's not nobody spared.  Everybody's indicted.  The whole system is indicted.  And he's not, you know, playing a game where he puts the blame all on the Republicans, which is, you know, one of the things that's most common in standard Democratic circles.  He says the system cannot reform itself, which means... And he laid this out beautifully.  He said Black Lives Matter started under... a black president with a black attorney general, and they couldn't deliver.  And when he says the system can't reform itself, that's him saying direct action is the only way, which led to, I think, his most important point, which is we're put in a situation now where it appears like it's either going to be nonviolent revolution... or endless violence.  So you need to set up a system that has a more democratic structure, democratic power sharing, a more democratic economy, ameliorate the extreme ills of capitalism or corporatism, and give people a fair shot, give people more equal power, give people a piece of the pie.  some wealth, or you're going to see, you know, continuous violence.  So, he's really making an argument here for left-wing values.  And, I mean, I just, I think it's an amazing breakdown.  I think it's a brilliant breakdown.  And the thing that, you know, I keep coming back to, because... I see no way around it, is that, yes, the spark that led to this was George Floyd and the clear instance of police brutality.  And so police brutality, in many ways, is at the center of this.  But at the same time, you can't tell me that everything else isn't also feeding into the moment.  Like, somebody said on Twitter... The way that they're describing this in British newspapers is interesting because they just they're saying it's like it's only about George Floyd, like the stuff that's happening all across the country in all these major cities like that's about George Floyd, period.  And it's like that doesn't really capture it.  You know, that doesn't.  that's not it.  That that's a big part of it.  Yes.  Reforming police departments, ending police brutality, bringing about justice, not just arresting these police officers or prosecuting them, finding them guilty.  Like, that's all part of it.  But... Don't tell me that the current state of our country doesn't also weigh into this.  Don't tell me that the fact that we're in a Great Depression as we have a pandemic, don't tell me that doesn't play into it.  It absolutely plays into it.  It absolutely plays into it that... We're going to have a mass eviction and foreclosure crisis as soon as the pandemic is officially declared over and we get back to business as usual.  People can't pay the bills right now.  So we have a Great Depression.  We have a total economic collapse.  And we don't have UBI.  We don't have universal health care.  Again, in a pandemic, 43 million people, up to that many are going to lose their health care now in a pandemic.  Don't tell me that that doesn't play a role here.  Don't tell me it doesn't play a role when you have the pandemic and an economic depression hit, but the government steps up to bail out the stock market and corporations.  A $5 trillion bailout package for the wealthy with no strings attached and no oversight.  At the same time, the people got crumbs, a one-time $1,200 payment, and now they're assed out.  Now they're screwed.  What now?  What are they going to do?  That's how you get, you know, the pent up anger, aggression, misery, frustration.  People see how disgusting and unfair and lopsided this system is.  The deep income and wealth inequality.  The fact that people feel like they have no chance at anything.  And on top of that, police wantonly murder people.  What did you think was going to happen?  What did you think was going to happen?  Of course there was going to be a backlash.  Of course there was.  I'm not defending the most egregious actions of rioters or looters.  I'm not okay with, you know, ransacking a small business.  That's not right.  But what I'm trying to explain to people is that it's like a math problem.  It doesn't matter what you try to do to obfuscate 3 plus 2 equals 5, right?  So what just happened is a clear example of this is what happens when you do what's been done.  This is gonna happen.  And here we are.  So Cornel West, as usual, brilliant, breaks it down perfectly.  And I hope he's allowed on mainstream media more.  But more importantly, more importantly, I think he's one of very few voices who has the moral legitimacy and standing to lead.  these protests and harness it towards positive ends.  See, I've always told you guys on this show, I've always maintained, I'm not a fan of the kinds of protests where it's just like, we're just blowing off steam.  We're just angry, and so we're going to get out there.  What are our goals?  Don't know.  We're just mad.  It's an amorphous show of rage.  I get it.  I get where it comes from.  But that will be defeated.  That's not a question.  It will be defeated.  Especially when the government steps up their crackdown.  It'll be defeated.  So what you need is the kind of integrity, honor, and moral vision and leadership to harness this energy and harness this will towards positive change.  I mean, imagine you had Cornel West and Killer Mike, and we'll get to his speech in a second.  It's brilliant.  But imagine we had them leading it and harnessing the energy towards the solutions laid out in Campaign Zero.  End broken windows policing, community oversight boards, limit use of force, independently investigate and prosecute, community representations, body cameras on the cops, no exceptions, training for de-escalation, end for-profit policing, demilitarization, fair police union contracts.  Imagine the energy was harnessed towards that.  Imagine the energy was harnessed towards UBI and a living wage and Medicare for all.  But you need that kind of leadership.  You need the leadership.  I know some people are very much in favor of a decentralized thing, and there are reasons for that.  But the only way you get the real change... By having a vision, being consistent, being persistent, and being unapologetic.  So, I hope that, you know, he kind of takes the reins of this because I think he's one of the few voices who's equipped to lead in this moment.  Who's equipped to lead in this moment.  You know, I'm not a big believer in hardcore identity politics, but... I don't think a white kid from the suburbs like myself is fit and equipped to lead in a moment like this.  You need somebody with the standing and moral clarity and legitimacy to lead.  Cornell West, Killer Mike, Nina Turner, you know, somebody needs to take the reins of what's happening here and bring it the kind of stability, leadership, and clear defined goals that it deserves, that we all deserve.
