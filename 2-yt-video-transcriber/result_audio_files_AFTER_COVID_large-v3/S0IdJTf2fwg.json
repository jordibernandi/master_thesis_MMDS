            "text": "Stop it!  I'm Gerry Barnett.  I'm a campaigner for free expression and sexual freedom and a writer on science, sex, censorship and identity politics.  I'm the author of a book called Porn Panic which looks at the history of feminism as an authoritarian pro-censorship movement.  So here I am at a men's conference with a talk entitled Too Many Men.  I accept that this isn't a good way to win friends and influence people But in many ways this statement is true.  I'm going to look at how sexual strategy is first evolved in humans and how these led to the various gender gaps we see today.  Finally, I'll look at whether there's a way forward that can help close gender gaps and lead us to a happier place.  So when I talk about gender gaps, I'm talking about some things that disadvantage men and others that disadvantage women.  It's undeniable that women suffer much higher levels of sexual violence than men, and equally true that men suffer higher murder rates, are more likely to commit suicide, are more likely to end up in prison, or get shot by police, and so on.  These differences are all rooted in human biology, but this doesn't mean they can't be resolved.  However, we can't begin to improve things for either men or women if we buy into junk explanations.  It would be nice to think that male and female behaviour differences are socially constructed, so all we have to do is learn to think differently and shazam, everything is fixed.  But this isn't true.  The essence of male and female behavioural differences is rooted in millions of years of evolution, as well as thousands of years of civilisation.  We need to understand our origins as a species if we're going to make life better for our sons and daughters.  I'll point out that I'm very much a progressive and an optimist in my thinking.  History shows us that whenever society has hit bumps in the road, it has evolved to find workarounds and move forward again.  This means that I don't generally buy conservative viewpoints that rely on trying to turn back the clock to a better time.  This is for two reasons.  First, the old solutions often don't work a second time around.  And second, because generally we look back with rose-tinted glasses and tend to imagine that the past was better than it actually was.  The past always contains valuable lessons, but the conservative instinct to go back is generally misguided.  At the root of everything is the sex trade.  Everyone instinctively understands that the trade of sex is not and can never be an equal thing.  The fact that female sex is clearly a more valuable commodity than male.  sex is fixed by our biology, not by social trends.  To explain this, I'm going to take a look into science and look at how sex evolved and how it shaped humans. ",
