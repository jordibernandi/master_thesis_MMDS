            "text": "Hello and welcome to Philosophy Vibe the channel where we discuss and debate different philosophical ideas.  Today we're going to be looking into a major problem within the divine command theory and that is the Euthyphro Dilemma.  Interesting Now to give a brief summary of the divine command theory.  Ultimately, it is the idea that morality comes from God.  What is good is that which is commanded by God and what is evil is that which God forbids.  We learn about morality through the divine or the religious texts such as the Bible, the Torah, the Quran etc.  By reading and understanding the religious texts, a moral person is the one who follows the rules of God.

            "text": "However, within the divine command theory there arises a dilemma known as the Euthyphro Dilemma.  Originally written by Plato as a dialogue between Socrates and Euthyphro, it was then studied by many religious and ethical scholars.  To put it simply, the Euthyphro Dilemma questions the nature of the divine command theory and leads to two fundamental points about morality coming from the divine.  Point 1.  Is that which is morally good, good because God commands it?  Or point 2.  Does God command it because it is morally good? ",

Morality is in fact something God has discovered, something God is bound to.  God recommends good not because he has decided this but because this is the right and moral way to live. ",
