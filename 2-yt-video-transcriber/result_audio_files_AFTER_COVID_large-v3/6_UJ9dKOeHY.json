            "text": "All right, ladies and gentlemen, my name is Justin from The Unboxing Authority watching the epic, awesome, amazing episode.  Today, we're going to show you the easy way to get rid of the carbon buildup inside your engine if you have an internal combustion engine and also to clean out your fuel injectors.  Make sure to consult the manufacturer of your car or your mechanic before you try anything like this.  Starting out, I wanna tell you that to decarbonize your car, you're gonna need some seafoam oil, okay?  And so that seafoam oil is what we're putting into the vacuum line in the engine on the left-hand side.  When you're doing this, the engine needs to be at full temperature first before you start. ",

            "text": "So we are decarbonizing over here.  And going into the vacuum line and over here we are cleaning the injectors by disabling the fuel pump and going through the fuel rail up there.  And so we've got an injector cleaner going in there.  It's being pushed by shop air from air compressor since there's no fuel pump. ",

            "text": "This tool that we're using allows the sea foam to just drip gradually into the engine because if you pour too much in at once it's not so great for it running over a duration and getting it in there.  The old-fashioned way was to use the spray version or a funnel or something and pretty much choke the car.  And so that's why someone would be sitting inside the car pushing their pedal down on the accelerator.  Because we have this system and it's dripping, we control the flow of the seat foam going into the vacuum line.  We no longer have to worry about that.  However, just before you shut the car off, after at least 10 minutes of the engine being at full temperature, okay, when you're doing this, the engine needs to be at full temperature first before you start.  And so that usually means the fan's going to come on when it's at full temperature.  And so then what you're going to do is right before 10 minutes after you've started the process, you're going to want to open up your seafoam all the way into the vacuum line.  so it's almost going to stop the car.  And then you should have smoke coming out the tailpipe if there's enough.  seafoam going in and then you shut the car off and you let it set for another 10 minutes.  so first you get the car to temperature then you run the cleaner and the seafoam into the vacuum line for 10 minutes after the cars running temperature.  then you shut it off for 10 minutes.  Then after that, you take the car out on a steep hill where you're going up the hill or out on the highway at highway speed.  And you're wanting to see lots of smoke come out of the back of the car.  You're wanting to burn all the carbon buildup out of the car. ",

            "text": "Yeah.  Now, of course, before you do that, you want to make sure that you've disconnected all of these tools from the car, that you don't have any tools under your hood of your car or an engine compartment.  You also want to make sure that you replace any caps and reconnect your vacuum line.  You do not want to leave the vacuum line disconnected.  This is going to give you more power in your engine and probably help you with mileage as well.  You can get everything you've seen in the video from your local NAPA Auto Parts.  A car manufacturer's goal is to try to keep carbon from going out the exhaust pipe.  That's how they meet emission standards.  That's how they pass quality control.  But that doesn't mean that the carbon exits the engine.  It means that it builds up inside the engine, and that's why you have to decarbonize the engine is to get that carbon out.  So despite environmentalists and car manufacturers having an attempt to keep the carbon all bottled up inside the engine, it does have to come out at some point.  And so regardless of environmentalism, that carbon will get out into the atmosphere one way or another.  Some people think that electric cars have less of an impact on the environment.  However, they're heavier, so they do more damage to the roads, which means the roads have to be maintained and rebuilt much more often.  Also, the amount of energy that it takes to go into those batteries, to pull those heavy batteries around, because the car is much heavier.  Anytime you're moving something that's heavier, it's going to require more energy.  The most efficient transfer of energy for moving an automobile is by combusting gasoline or diesel.  The only way to make electric cars more efficient is to make the batteries smaller, make them weigh less, and still have the same amount of energy or more than they do now.  The other big issue with electric cars is that they have to be recharged.  There's a distance they have to go.  Some people talked about replacing the batteries at the recharging stations.  Instead of recharging the car you just replace the battery with another used battery.  So don't let decarbonizing your car discourage you and make you think that you're harming the environment any worse than someone with an electric car or another type of car that's out there.  Carbureted cars.  Thankfully, you don't need to have their injectors cleaned, but you may need to clean your carburetor from time to time.  If cleaning your injectors with this method does not work and you don't do it often enough, you may need to take it into a Napa repair shop.  in order to have them cleaned correctly.  Thanks so much for watching the video.  May God bless you, your family, and all God has for you to do. ",
