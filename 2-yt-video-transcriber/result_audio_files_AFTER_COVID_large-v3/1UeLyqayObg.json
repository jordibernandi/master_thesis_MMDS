            "text": "Oh, that's just something that's been floating around in my mind for years.  I started thinking that way back in the early 1970s, I think, or the late 1960s.  And I said, California is sort of like an incubator for experimentation, particularly when it comes to matters of sex.  Sex is very important.  Sex is extremely powerful.  It's the greatest motivating force among the people of the planet next to the system of white supremacy itself.  It motivates, you know, everything is sexual, everything.  You know, but it's secondary to the system of white supremacy.  System of white supremacy, in my opinion, is the most powerful motivating force among the people of the entire planet Earth.  and sex is the second most powerful.  So I started noticing, particularly around San Francisco and places like that, that the white supremacists were, you know, engaging in new experimentation of everything sexual, all right?  And then all during the 1960s, there was a lot of experimentation everywhere, all right?  But I mean, but it wasn't so much gender experimentation.  It was just male with female doing all sorts of things, with the porn magazines and all this.  I mean... The Playboy Mansion.  I mean, everything's sex, all during the 1960s.  The miniskirts and all that.  And people just sex, sex, sex, sex, sex.  All kinds of books about sex.  Sex started matching the books about murder mysteries, which that's a weird thing.  You go into a bookstore, most of the books are about murdering somebody or it's about engaging in various forms of sexual activity.  That's what the books in there are about.  I mean, how to run a locomotive, you go back to the back of the bookstore for that.  I mean, back there in the dustbin.  how to grow asparagus, or how to put up a building and whatnot.  I mean, you might find those books back there in a special section, but most of the books are going to be about killing somebody, war, murder, or it's going to be about sex.  I mean, women with their legs gaffed open, I mean, sitting up in the middle of the window in the bookstore and whatnot, and So a lot of the 1960s was made up of that.  But by the 1970s, they started saying, we need new sexualities.  I mean, this thing about male and female, that's old-fashioned.  I mean, we need to invigorate this thing.  We need to pump it up, all right?  And say, well, pump it up by doing what?  Well, we need some people who male with male.  And not only that, we need different varieties of that.  Not just one variety, not just male with a male.  I mean, you know, we've always had plenty of that.  That's kind of old hat.  Everybody understands that.  Or female with a female.  But we need to break that down into, you know, little bits and pieces of this and that and the other.  Well, like what?  Well, we need to come up with something called trans.  Well, trans what?  Well, it might mean anything.  Trans this, trans that, maybe polygamy.  15, 20, 30, 40 different types of trans, transsexuality.  Well, what does that mean?  And is it an improvement over what we have had before?  Oh, it'll be a great improvement.  Well, improvement how?  What is it improving?  Oh, well, you know, as part of the liberation package.  What do you mean by liberation package?  Oh, well, you figure that out as we go along.  And so they were doing this mostly in Northern California at the time, all right, and started jumping all over people who were questioning.  Yeah.  All right.  Hey, they backlash real quick.  They say you're homophobic and whatnot or something.  without explaining exactly what that means.  All right?  I looked it up in the dictionary.  Homophobic?  You know, they say being afraid of someone who is homosexual.  Well, let's break that down.  Afraid how?  What are you doing to show fear?  Say, well, a lot of people kill people.  In some parts of the world, it's legal to kill them.  You know, Adolf Hitler was doing it and whatnot.  And they say, no, well, you don't want nobody killing nobody and all like that.  But now, are there any other types of fear?  Well, yeah, there are other types of fear.  Well, other types of fear that make people do what?  Well, just fear.  Just fear in the abstract.  You know, well, wait a minute.  No, we need some details here.  We're going to make all these wonderful changes that you're talking about.  So... In answer to the question, I started noticing it.  It was mostly happening in Northern California and then spread to Southern California and then started spreading everywhere.  And then I understand that there was a huge drumbeat at that same time in a place called Brazil for the same thing.  Now I understand that a lot of people who are in Brazil are beginning to say, wait a minute, who thought all this up?  particularly among all us dark-skinned people.  Where is this coming from?  And is it an improvement?  Now, I understand Brazil, particularly at Mardi Gras time, had always been what you call a real, real what you call liberated, as far back as anybody can remember, when it came to naked women and all this type of thing for raiding in the street.  Yes, sir.  But this thing called, you know, trans this and trans that, and we need about 40 or 50 different types of sexuality among people to improve ourselves, then I start saying, wait a minute, in a lot of this, it seems like they are putting the black people right in the forefront of it.  And then I really became suspicious of it then.  When it was all white people, I wasn't paying much attention.  But when they started putting black people in the front of it, I said, this is a white supremacist thing.  And that's the conclusion I've come to right to this day. ",
