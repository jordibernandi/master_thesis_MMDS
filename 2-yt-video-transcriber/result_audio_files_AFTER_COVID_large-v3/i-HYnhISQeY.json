About 38 million people rely on SNAP benefits to feed their families, and last month the USDA announced it would increase overall benefits 40% to give families more money to buy food.  Unfortunately, many food stamp households were left out of the benefit expansion because they were already receiving the maximum amount.  Now, while Democrats are trying to raise benefits by 15%, Republicans are attempting to block that change.  Just for context, the maximum benefit for a family of four is only $646 per month.  For Republicans, giving hungry families an extra hundred bucks during a worldwide pandemic is too big of an ask.  both because they deeply passionately don't give a about poor people and because steve mnuchin needs it to fashion sheets for his bed.
