Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel.  Born is the King of Israel the son of god.  in kindness he came as a friend to the hopeless the lost and the lame Since he bore, yet his name we despised, and the hands that brought healing were pierced as he died.  Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel.  Born is the King of Israel.  Oh, He is born.  The author of life.  Their lifeless healing As the grave cast its shadow and darkness reigned.  Then out of death broke forth the great light.  As he rose up in victory, the glorious Christ.  Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel born is the King of Israel.  Now let us all in one accord bring praises to our King.  O glory, power, and honor be forever unto him.  now let us all with one accord bring praises to our king.  All glory, power, and honor be forever unto Him. ",
