            "text": "Okay.  It says that Messiah came into the world to destroy the works of the enemy.  And therefore, therefore we have the power of Messiah to destroy the works of the enemy.  You are here to destroy the works of the enemy.  You are in the world.  That's a good thing.  It's not a negative thing.  It's a positive thing.  You're here to destroy the works of addiction, of anger, of abuse, of, of immorality, of sin, of all those things, of hatred.  You are in the world.  You have the power to destroy works of the enemy.  To, to heal the broken.  The works of the enemy.  But it says, I saw the enemy, I saw Satan falling, in Hebrew, hasatan, the enemy.  That says something.  The nature of the enemy, you might not think about it this way, but the nature of the enemy is to fall.  He's the first one to fall when he rebelled.  But yet Revelation, that's the beginning of the Bible, the end of the Bible, what happens, it speaks of the fall again of the, the, of the, of the enemy in the same way.  The nature of the enemy is to fall.  I remember when I first came to the Lord and I was still listening to a lot of the music that I listened to before I knew the Lord.  A lot of dark music or, you know, not overtly but, you know, a lot.  And I'm listening to one song.  I'm, I'm, I'm in the Lord now.  I'm still listening to the song and the radio's on and I never heard the song before.  And there was nothing about it that didn't seem like it was especially hard or dark.  It just, it wouldn't sound particularly pagan or anything like that.  And I'm listening to it and, and it's, I don't even know why I said it.  I said, this is devil music.  And I don't know why I even said it.  I don't even talk like that.  And it turned out, then this, then the words came and the song was called Dancing with the Devil.  But I didn't know that.  I didn't know that.  It was the Spirit.  I didn't know that.  My friend had recently come to the Lord at the same time and he had a similar revelation, very different.  He was very much into Led Zeppelin.  Remember Led Zeppelin?  On their record label, he was praying, Lord, should I be listening to this or not?  He just came to the Lord.  And it had this winged figure on the record, you know.  Could be like it's Icarus, that myth, but not quite.  And he's looking at it, and it's twirling and twirling.  And then all of a sudden, it's like he said, that's the fallen angel.  It's an angel falling, falling, falling, falling.  And the record label was called Swan Song, like the last song of the angel.  who falls.  The nature of Satan, the enemy, is to fall.  No matter what.  The nature of evil is to pull you down.  The, to make you fall, to try to make you fall.  It, you know, it may look at a short time it's lifting you up, but it's always pulling you down.  The enemy and all his hosts, they follow him.  And so his children are always fallen.  It ends up.  the way of the enemy, the way of sin always ends up down.  And the way people who are into the occult always, always rips apart their life.  They may, you know, for a while they may seem like they have power and in the end it destroys their life.  Hitler, child of following the enemy, rose to incredible power.  And what happened?  Fell.  Killed by his own hand at the end.  The Nazis had a fall.  Communism had a fall.  I mean, no matter how long it goes it's going to fall because it's darkness.  In the end God is on the throne, not the enemy.  So all the works of the enemy have to fall.  So every temptation that you're tempted with, it has a fall at the end of it.  You may not see it.  It may look good.  But at the end there's a fall.  There's something to mess up your life.  To, to, to pull you down.  To tear you apart.  If you listen to any, any, behind any temptations the voice of the enemy, the fallen one, you'll see the nature of the enemy is to fall, but the nature of God is to rise.  Think about that.  Even if he, even if he dies on the cross, he rises.  The nature of God and godliness and righteousness is to always rise.  And it may be hard.  It may be like, it may involve something like giving up.  It may, it may do things that are hard for your flesh.  But it always ends up making you rise.  Humble yourself and what?  You shall be lifted up.  The nature of the more you follow the will of God, the more all things are going to lift you up in some way.  You're going to be lifted up.  It doesn't matter what's happening in the world.  It's going to be a force that's moving you to lift you up.  To make things come together in your life.  Doesn't matter if the circumstance is easy or hard.  You're going to be lifted up.  And so I saw, he said, I saw the enemy falling.  It's holy to see that because he's Messiah.  He's holy.  He's got to see what he does.  So, so we are also supposed to see that meaning.  God wants you to see through every temptation.  Then he wants you to see the fall of it.  So you're not going to, so you won't fall.  He wants you to see.  every time you're being intimidated by evil, by something dark, he doesn't, or overwhelmed, he doesn't want you to be overwhelmed.  He doesn't want you to, to despair.  He wants you to see through it and say that is going to fall.  That is not going to last.  When you see things in the world and you see the evil, like, like David says, why did the evil prosper?  Just know it's not forever.  It's going to fall.  Whatever is wrong.  Don't get, don't, don't fear evil.  Know that it's going to fall no matter what.  I will fear no evil.  Because if you fear evil, you're going to give into it in some way.  You're going to react to it.  But know, you know the end of it.  I saw the end of it.  It says, it says in the Bible.  See through the end.  The end is that evil falls.  At the end good is going to rise no matter what.  May take time, but it's going to go.  It's going to rise. ",
