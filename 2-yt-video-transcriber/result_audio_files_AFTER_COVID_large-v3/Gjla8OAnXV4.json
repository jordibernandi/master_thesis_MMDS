I would probably say that one experiment that everyone could do where you get a boat onto a body of water and shine a powerful laser pointer onto a flag attached to it, and then sail out a bit and you see that the laser dot has moved upwards.

Just because the balls of the tables are round does not mean the table itself is, because ultimately flat earthers think that the earth is entirely a different thing compared to all the other planets.  The argument Dr.  Tyson made would only work if we start with the premise that the earth is a planet just like all the other planets in the solar system, and that is something flat earthers already reject to begin with.

You can see them together pretty often without even turning your head, so it shouldn't be a surprise that the Moon is visible on the other side when you're sort of sitting in position of the Earth to be in between them.

But anyway, this type of eclipse does happen when the moon's eclipse is visible during the daylight.  This type of eclipse is called a selenelion.  Wait, why does it feel like I made a video on this before?  Whatever, I don't remember.  Selenelions are possible due to Earth's atmospheric refraction.  Oh no, the scary two words that flat earthers can't stand.  So, basically, he's claiming that this means the Sun, Earth, and Moon are not aligned in a 180 degree fashion.  Well, sorry to burst your bubble, but they still are.  The only difference is that the light is bending through the atmosphere enough for you to still see light in the sky from the Sun.  I won't go into too much detail.  Basically, there's moisture, air, and dust in the sky.  The combination of these substances can cause a discrepancy in the indexes of refraction of the air.  It is generally denser near the surface and less dense the higher up you go.  It's a gradient.  So when light passes through it in a horizontal fashion, it curves towards the Earth.  This makes it so that even if the Sun is set behind the horizon, you can still see it, or at least the light coming from it.  That's how it can still technically be partially daytime when you see the lunar eclipse.  Of course, refraction would be less intense if the Sun is directly overhead.  So yeah, that's the story.  No tricks, just refraction.  If you don't believe in refraction, it's actually pretty easy to conduct an experiment.  Just get a glass of water or something. ",

Using sextants and plane trigonometry, by measuring the sun's angle at two points on Earth simultaneously and factoring their distance from each other, the Pythagorean theorem reveals both the height and dimensions of the sun.

Quite dishonest for Eric Dub\u00e9 to use it as flat earth evidence here, but you know we have plenty of other ways to determine the size of the earth and the size of the sun.  For example, you can measure it using solar telescopes.  For distance, you can determine it using parallax calculations with Mars.  And these aren't the only methods.
