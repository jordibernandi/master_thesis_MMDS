            "text": "Well, now I'll give you the contrary view first.  A lot of critics think, yes, the Christians said on the first day of the week or the third day, however you want to count it.  but they think that in the Old Testament the third day is sometimes used as a day of redemption.  So maybe that was a theological conclusion, not a historical conclusion.  Now, one thing to note, that view that this was not a historical conclusion, came during the day in the influence of Rudolf Bultmann and those who didn't find very much history.  And he was quite skeptical.  He's famous for a one-liner where he says basically all we can know about Jesus is that he was a first-century itinerant Jewish preacher who preached the kingdom of God, died for it, and then later he said, oh yeah, his disciples thought they saw him later.  And he said that's basically all we can do.  He was very, very skeptical.  And this came during that age.  But when you look at the data, The sources over and over, early sources, these same early ones we're talking about, out-of-the-gate sources, say third day, first day of the week, it shows up in the earliest proclamations, For example, very early in the New Testament, they're worshiping on Sunday.  Now, if the third day slash first day, same day, if that was the third day we will be blessed by God, if it's a blessed kind of conclusion from the Old Testament, why are they actually physically worshiping on Sunday?  That definitely favors the view that this was an historical event.  that said, like Jesus, so are we.  And, you know, one interesting point, the book of John, when Thomas, the famous story that Doubting Thomas wasn't there, it says eight days later, because you go, I thought that was a week after Easter.  Well, on the Jewish calculation, that is any part of a day counts a whole day.  It's the next Sunday.  But even when Thomas gets together, that's still the next Sunday.  That's how early it was.  So we've got pretty good data.  that that third day slash first day equals that Sunday, and the people who were doing it were Orthodox Jewish believers.  who, you know, accepted Jesus as the Messiah.
