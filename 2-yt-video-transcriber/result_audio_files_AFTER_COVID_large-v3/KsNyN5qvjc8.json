We popped off the door panels of the truck.  I'm trying really hard to see if there's any drugs inside.  Checking the tailgate for any hollow compartments.  Man, I wasn't here for the canine walk around, but these officers believe that there's some drugs somewhere.  Doesn't look like they're giving up on a search either.  And this is why, ladies and gentlemen, we do not want a consent to search.  You see that officer, He's trying to pop that center console back in.  You know, these cops are not mechanics.  And if you don't want any damages to your vehicle, then I would strongly advise that you don't consent to searches.  What's that?  I'm not.  No.  Yeah, I'm just making sure everything's good, everything, you know, they're not going to plant any drugs or no one gets hurt, things of that nature, you know.  I have a YouTube channel that I run.  And, yeah, I give you a business card before you take off.  It's in my car.  Oh, you about to take off?  Yeah.  Oh, no.  I just was driving down the highway and saw the traffic stop and had to pull the U-turn just to get back in here, but it doesn't look like the officers found anything.  I can tell you right now I'm about a good maybe 15 feet from these officers reporting.  And so far they've been respectful of my rights to record.  Except for the bloody officer who wants to immediately give me a directive as soon as I start walking near the scene.  And of course, you click on the county.  Looks like he's free to go.  And no drugs were found.  And you see he's trying to push in the console, looks like he's trying to fix what they messed up.  So you know he's upset.  You don't want your car ramble through like that and taken apart.  Citation.  I honestly wonder what the probable cause is to search the car.  Hey, how you doing?  Hey, I got a question for you.  Can I grab your mask, brother?  I can back up six feet.  Do you know what the probable cause was to search?  Yeah, man. ",
