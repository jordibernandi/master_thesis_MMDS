            "text": "Hey guys, welcome back to Strong Successful Male.  So for today, I'm going to be going over this great comeback story about this guy who is a subscriber and emailed me his story the other day, where basically his girlfriend of eight years, eight years, he finds out that she was cheating on him.  And then obviously she breaks up with him.  And as you can probably understand, he was devastated, went through some hard times, licking his wounds and all that.  But then eventually pulled out of it, started going back to the gym, getting himself into great shape, better shape than he was before.  He started really doing a lot of reading and researching materials about women and dating and human nature and all that.  the red pill stuff found my channel and all that put together has really given him a second chance.  he's got a clean slate and he's doing great because now he's completely focused on himself his career what he wants to do with his life being in great shape and not to mention he's now having a blast dating multiple women.  and because this guy now has developed this because this guy has basically seen the light so to speak and he has this really indifferent, take-or-leave-it attitude when it comes to women.  As you can imagine, the women are banging down his doors.  And so he's dating multiple women, having a great time, and no surprise, guess who came crawling back later on once this guy really got himself back together?  The ex.  So I'm doing this because many of you guys either have been in situations like this, or maybe you're going through this right now, or one day I guarantee you some of you guys may be in this situation, and this can show you what can happen when you then... You pick up the pieces and restart your life and how things can be so much better.  It's really great to hear a story like this.  So he starts off saying, Dear SSM, I'm a huge fan of your videos and recently got into them following a particularly rough time in my life.  I thought it may be a good opportunity to share my story and allow you to do a video with some analysis on it.  I know that if I had personally heard this story a couple months ago, it would have helped me get through things easier, and if this assists even one person going forward, I count that as a success.  I apologize for the length, but I thought that all portions were relevant to setting things up.  No problem.  This is a little long, but it will definitely help guys out there in this situation.  And, yeah, if he can help one person out by hearing this story, then it's a win.  And it makes some good with some of the shit he went through.  But, again, this guy comes out on top, and it's pretty awesome.  His story starts out saying, I met my girlfriend in my first year of university when we were living in a residence on campus.  I was instantly attracted to her due to her good looks, dedication to fitness, and career ambition.  And he says in parentheses, she was committed to becoming a doctor like her parents.  I too was quite ambitious and always wanted to go to law school so we seemed like the perfect power couple.  For the first five years that we dated, we lived apart and things were great.  So he thought.  We both worked hard to achieve our goals, but were still able to spend quality time together.  When we both got accepted into our degree of choice, her into medical school, and myself into a combined law MBA program at the same school, I thought it was the universe's sign that we were meant to be together forever.  We ended up moving into a condo together, and I couldn't have been happier.  But our story didn't have a fairytale ending, and things all changed three years later when she started her residency program.  I hate to break it to you, and I'm sure this guy knows, but to the rest of you guys, there's no such thing as the fairytale story or the fairytale ending.  That's all bullshit.  That's all movies and television trying to sell that idea.  Okay?  Don't blame me.  I'm just sharing my life experience in that department.  And there's plenty of guys watching this right now that can comment below saying, yeah, the fairy tale romance and marriage and love, that's horse shit.  Leave it in the fucking movies.  Goes on.  She spent insane hours at the hospital working and developing a relationship with one of her co-residents.  She ended up sleeping with him, and he says in parentheses, for who knows how long, but I found out about it and confronted her as she would never have told me.  Of course she wouldn't have told you.  The only way she would have told you is if she was ready to go at that point.  Her only response was to me, I just didn't see a future with you.  No apology, no explanation for losing interest, or continuing to string me along, nothing.  Well, that's real loving of her.  Eh, I just lost interest.  I didn't see a future with you.  Well, if she didn't see a future with him, why'd she stay with him?  I'll tell you why.  Because they were living together in the condo.  And this guy obviously was helping, if not taking care of all the bills, he doesn't say.  And so, takes care of her expenses.  And I'm willing to bet you when she got done, then she would have moved on.  It's really sad, but that type of shit happens.  And I know a lot of you guys have been in situations like that.  He says... We dated for eight years, starting when we were teenagers.  I was in a super competitive dual degree program, worked out religiously, played a ton of intramural sports, had a large social circle, and still made time for her.  We never fought, but despite all that, I loved her unconditionally, and I believe that's why she got bored or thought that the grass may be greener somewhere else.  So after all we had been through and the life we started to build for ourselves, and he says in parentheses, we discussed marriage, kids,  etc.,  all I got in return was her bailing on me at the drop of a hat without a hint of remorse.  That's how they operate, okay?  They fall in love slowly over time, and they fall out of love slowly over time, okay?  And I'm willing to bet you there was a time and place in the beginning that she probably, you know, felt that way towards you and meant that at the time, but then things changed, and she probably got bored.  You know, who knows?  I don't know the whole story here.  I don't know if the guy completely gave up all the things that he enjoyed and and focus all his attention on her.  i don't think that's the case.  but a lot of a lot of guys do that.  they stop they stop hanging out with their buddies they stop doing all the things they enjoy to spend all the time with the girl because she says that's what she wants and then they do that and she gets bored of them thinking hey you're not the same guy that you always were and says oh you changed and cheats on him or just ends it like that.  and the guy's like hey i i did everything you wanted what what gives women don't know what the they want but And see how she's completely remorseless here.  But he gets even in the end.  Or shall I say, simply getting his life better, he gets even.  He goes on to say... I recalled all the opportunities in the past that I had to cheat, where in some cases women threw themselves at me, but I never caved, so it was incredibly tough to comprehend that the first chance she got, she jumped on it.  Obviously, I valued myself too much to try to fight for her, so I left.  Good for you, dude.  After that bullshit, she's cheating on you, and God knows how long that was going on, and God knows if there was other flings going on in the past.  Good for you, man.  Get the hell out of there.  I'm glad you weren't crying like a little baby.  I'm glad you weren't trying to plead or any of that bullshit because that would have made it worse.  So good for you for getting out of there because, guys, if you have a girlfriend and she's cheating on you, I guarantee you she's going to do it again.  Just cut your losses and move the hell on.  Get on with your life and use that hard experience to teach you, give you that tough lesson so that you don't get caught in that situation again and get your heart broken and embarrassed and made a fool of.  And by the way, he said he had lots of opportunities to obviously cheat if he wanted to.  I definitely believe that.  But contrary to what is sold in movies and television and songs, really a lot in songs, because in music they try to make the guy be the bad guy.  The guy's the bad guy and the woman's the good girl.  The reality is men have, let's be honest here, guys really have a heart.  More guys have hearts than women do.  And I know some women can get on here and be like, no, that's not true.  Yes, it's true.  And there's been lots of times in my life when I was younger that I had girlfriends and I could have cheated and I didn't because I felt bad.  I felt it was the wrong thing to do.  But guess what?  Do you think women in the same situation would avoid cheating?  It doesn't happen that way.  I'm not saying all, but a hell of a lot of women cheat.  And there are far less, they'll cheat much quicker than a guy will.  Because women are very, very good at covering their tracks and making guys not even realize it.  Like this guy, he didn't know until like God knows how long it was going on.  All right, it goes on to say, for the next couple of months, I was crushed.  Dude, that's totally understandable.  I couldn't believe it.  My friends and family couldn't either.  Not only had the love of my life abandoned me on a whim, but due to the pandemic, I could not fall back on my usual crutches of watching sports or drowning my sorrows and booze with my friends.  I blamed myself for her cheating.  What did or didn't I do that would cause her to do this?  I was truly in a dark place, back living with my parents, not eating and losing a bunch of weight, and in general, just being stripped of all confidence that I once had.  Bro, that's completely normal.  Eight years with this woman, since you were a teenager, and she pulled this shit with no remorse, I feel like shit too.  But you had to go through this.  You had to go through this period of time, and then now, which you're going to see in a second, guys, he starts rebuilding his life, and that's awesome.  But you got to go through this bullshit.  You got to mourn and all that crap.  Again, those that do relationships, I don't do relationships anymore.  I'm not going to deal with this horse shit anymore, but I've been there, and I get it.  Trust me.  Let's see here.  My life felt like... My life felt as if I went from cruising down the freeway in a sports car to the road ending up being blocked, forcing me to turn down an exit ramp into a sketchy neighborhood that I'd never driven before.  I was so content with my life, and it was completely flipped upside down.  It would never be the same, and that was terrifying to me.  Guys, if you're ever in a situation like this, you feel always hopeless, please understand... Tomorrow is a new day.  You always have the chance to start over.  You always have a chance to have a clean slate.  So if you're watching this and you're like 50 years old, 60 years old, fuck it, 70 years old, and you've had hard times or whatever it happens to be, tomorrow's a new day.  You can do a clean slate, okay?  It's never too late to improve your life.  It's never too late to start over fresh, okay?  You got to go for it.  And this guy does.  But despite the pandemic shutting things down and forcing me to be myself, it allowed me to be super introspective of my life and what I wanted out of it.  My ex's parents called me crying and saying that they loved me and it was okay with it when I continued to send them updates on my life.  This was a tough call because after eight years, I considered them my family as well and cared about them deeply.  That's tough for a lot of guys.  They're with a woman for a long time, and for whatever reason it ends, but they have a connection with the family, and they really like you.  I mean, it's like a divorce, first of all, and it's like you lose, you know, another family.  It's a tough situation.  I consider them my family as well and cared about them deeply.  But although the call was emotional, it made me realize that the breakup was not my fault.  It wasn't your fault, dude.  You did everything you could.  I did everything that I could to make the relationship work, and I was burned all the same.  I started watching your videos and others, read Rolo's Rational Male books, and learned all about hypergamy and the red pill.  I'm sure that changed your life.  You'll never be the same after all this.  I began working out again, even more than I did before, and got into the best shape of my life.  I downloaded dating apps for the first time and tried them out.  Since I was so emotionally empty, my I don't care about you attitude when I went out with girls was like catnip to them.  I couldn't believe that the worse and more indifferent that I treated them, the more they were into me.  It's the absolute truth.  It's unbelievable.  I did a video yesterday about how women find nice guys repelling and basically goes into all this stuff.  based on the article and the things I tell you about that the nice guys that put the girls on a pedestal, that are totally concerned about how they feel about them, treat them like the queen, kiss their ass, all these things, get treated like shit and are dumped.  But the guys that don't give a shit, that are completely indifferent, could take them or leave them, Women are chasing after him.  The same thing's happened to this guy.  And guys, I promise you, for those of you who do dating and relationships and all that, the day that comes that you truly, truly, in your heart and soul, can absolutely give a shit whether a woman is into you or not or whether she returns your text or returns your call or whether you may ever see her again, that is the day that you have reached a point that you can pretty much have your way.  They're going to be chasing after you just like with this guy, okay?  Because you don't give a shit.  And that bad boy, indifferent attitude is like a magnet to women.  It's unbelievable, but it works, okay?  And this guy, obviously, because he was hurt, as he said he was empty, there was no problem doing this.  But now, after all the knowledge he's gained and the hard life experience, he may be on this path for a while.  He goes on.  I focus solely on myself as the prize, and the results more than spoke for themselves.  Always see yourself as the prize, guys.  You come first, no matter what.  Nobody else comes before your wants and needs.  You put yourself first always.  Nobody else, and certainly not women.  And always see yourself as the prize, not them.  That's the way to go about it, and that's what this guy's doing, and he's getting these results.  I got with girls I never thought I'd have a chance with previously.  In addition to the new ones, I also started spinning plates and had a rotation of four FWBs that I would cycle through when the mood struck.  It allowed me to have my fun while not sacrificing my freedom and allowed me to focus on myself and what I wanted without someone else influencing me negatively.  With all this fun, I don't see why I would ever go back to an anonymous long-term relationship anytime soon.  Oh, and guess who contacted me recently trying to crawl her way back?  Gee, I wonder.  See, guys, this guy, he went through being depressed and licking his wounds, so to speak, healing himself.  Then he got back up, started going to the gym, training himself, getting in good shape, immersing himself in YouTube videos and books, learning about female nature, hypergamy, going the red pill way.  And with all that knowledge and him being indifferent, not giving a crap, he's got plenty of women, he's got rotations, he's having a blast, getting way hotter women.  they didn't think he'd ever get again.  Right?  And like he said right there, I can't imagine going back to being a monogamous relationship.  This guy may or he may not, but this is the way I live and it's great.  And I don't ever see myself going back to anything.  I'm never going to say never, but I guarantee you it would be a very, very long time.  I'd probably be an old man in a nursing home to ever do anything exclusive ever again, but who the hell knows.  I would just need someone to push the button when I fall to alert the nurses, but by then, I can just have the button with me.  But anyhow, and of course, this guy's working on himself, and guess who comes crawling back, right?  Because basically, he found out she was cheating and all that, and then walked away.  This guy's improving himself.  He's got plenty of women, and she comes crawling back.  Guys, You do this, for those of you you've been broken up with or cheated upon, and you walk away.  and that's it.  She's out of your life.  She's toast.  And you improve yourself.  You get back on track and you're better than you were before.  I guarantee you, she's going to find out.  And I guarantee you, she's going to come after you.  At that point then, you can decide whether you tell her basically to fuck off or have a little fun with her and then tell her to fuck off.  But don't take her back because I guarantee the same bullshit will happen all over again.  He goes on to say, none of the above was meant to be bragging in the slightest.  I'm simply pointing out that it can happen to the Will Smith of the world.  If it can happen to me, excuse me, if it can to me and all the work I put into being a high-value guy in the first place, then it can happen to anyone.  Exactly.  It can happen to anybody, guys.  I've realized since then that sometimes life beats you down in order for you to build yourself back up and recognize your full potential.  I've never been happier in my life than I am now.  Don't ever let a girl define you.  Focus on yourself and becoming the best version of you that you can be and the results will follow.  Keep up the great work, SSM, and you guys got this.  Cheers, Stronger Single.  That's awesome.  He's happier than he's ever been.  He's in great shape.  He's focusing on himself, his purpose, obviously, you know, his law degree and all that.  This guy's going to do great in life.  And I'm guessing, obviously, he's in his, let's see, probably... upper 20s, I'm going to guess.  So he has all this knowledge now.  And imagine the fun life he's going to have because he's going to be an attorney and he's obviously going to make good money doing that.  And with all this knowledge, it's going to be a good time.  Again, I wish I knew this stuff back in my mid to late 20s.  But hey, what I learned the hard way, I can try to help you guys out.  So guys, if you're in a situation like this, just like this guy, You can always turn it around.  It's never too late.  And you can also have the added bonus that the girl that screwed you over, one day you're doing well for yourself and better than before, she'll come crawling back.  And then you can then have the opportunity to handle it in whatever way you see fit.  So great job to this guy.  I'm really proud of him.  All right, guys, that's it for today.
