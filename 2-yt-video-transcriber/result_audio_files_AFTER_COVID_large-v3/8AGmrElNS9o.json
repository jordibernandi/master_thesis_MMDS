            "text": "For those who are currently struggling with addiction, I want to say that you are not alone and that there's hope.  You are so much stronger than you think you are.  I know you may feel alone and you may feel depressed, but you know what you need to do to continue in recovery or to start recovery.  Life has been very chaotic since I left high school, in good ways and in bad.  I definitely miss the RHS family every day, but, you know, I still have the support from all of the staff and all of my friends that I've made here, so it's been pretty good.  Since I graduated, I have been working full time as a housekeeper and I've been going to school full time to get my associate's degree as a human service practitioner.  After I graduate, I'm going to go back to school for two separate things.  I'm going back to get my degree as an art therapist and as a cosmetologist.  Since I graduated, I talked to Michelle and Mikayla and my friends from this school almost on a daily basis.  Keeping in touch with the staff and my friends has definitely helped through this experience of COVID.  I celebrated my three years and Michelle sent me my three-year medallion in the mail, which was very amazing and astounding and surprising, but also very sad that I couldn't be with my people.  But because this is a family, it's like, Talking to them is my normal, so I don't really, I don't know.  I have a very strong relationship with Michelle.  She is like another parent to me.  She's helped me through a lot of emotional trauma, whether that's personal, family, you know, professional with work or whatever.  But the way Michelle approaches recovery and the recovery community is so strong and welcoming.  You know, coming to the school and then maintaining my relationship with her, she has definitely created and helped me pave a road to success.  Because if I used, she did not yell at me.  She did not, you know, say, get out of my school.  She said, hey, let's look at this and what's the best approach for you?  Do you think you need to be drug tested more often?  Do you think you need to be put in a detox or do you think long-term treatment would benefit you more?  And I honestly think that not being turned away when you relapse or have a slip or anything, that makes somebody want to stay sober.  My life before recovery high school was a disaster.  It was a dumpster fire.  It really was.  This school and the way that the school has supported my mother through my drug addiction has... You know, I owe my life to Michelle, and to Mikayla, and to Jonah, and to Ellen, and to Mary Ellen, and to Jake, and then the other Jake, and Devin, and Chris.  It's like, I... And Angel, and Tara, and everybody else.  I... Honestly, the support that you have not just given me, but my mother, like, that... Oh my God, it just makes me so grateful, because before I came here, she had no support.  whatsoever for how to deal with a child with an addiction, but my life has changed for the better since I've been here.  Since filming the documentary, I am most proud of the fact that I've been able to do this for those out there who are struggling with recovery and who are young.  My goals and dreams for the future are to hopefully have this documentary impacts people in the best way possible to know that those struggling with addiction and those who know someone who struggles with addiction that you are not alone and you have people out there and you know this world is a crazy scary place but you will get through it.  it may be hard it may be tedious and it may suck but it's worth it.  Anything else you want to say?  I miss my RHS family.  I hate COVID.  I want hugs. ",
