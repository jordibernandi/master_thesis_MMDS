            "text": "Thank you.  Sometime toward the end of 2016, maybe beginning of 2017, two and a half years ago, I had a psychedelic journey using psilocybin where I had this very profound, realistic vision, experience.  really, it was like a visionary experience of Emma Watson and I talking.  I turned my head, I guess, and looked over, and it's Emma Watson staring at me.  It was on that night.  I had what felt like an hour-long vision of this future with her.  Over the next year and a half, really, there have been countless dreams, psychedelic visions, and sometimes even just in regular meditation where it's as if she just appears in front of me or there's some vision with her, but it feels as real as sitting in front of someone and talking to them.  Imagine yourself as someone who could actually be loved by someone like Emma Watson, who is, by all intents and purposes, a divine being.  I had a purging, an ayahuasca purge, that really released her, and it was like a scene straight out of Beauty and the Beast.  It was like I was singing Evermore as I puked.  Christ Sophia.  Because Jesus, I was talking to him, and he was like, basically say, look, you know the masculine Christ.  It's time for you to learn the feminine Christ.  Emma came back.  I had to make a video to declare by the power vested in me that Emma Watson is the embodiment of Christ in woman.  What an idiot. ",
