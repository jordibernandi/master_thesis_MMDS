            "text": "Hi.  So recently, Friendly Geordies and other affiliates and supporters of the Labor Party have started a big ol' pile-on on the Australian Unemployed Workers Union.  This apparently started as a Twitter spat between Geordies and people from that union.  And then he made a video on the topic where he tried to scrounge up whatever dirty laundry he could on them.  This video is not a defense of the AUWU.  I don't know anyone from the union, I don't know anyone who's had trouble with them.  I can't comment on those aspects.  What it is about is the fact that there is far more to this than that.  You see, Geordies is a federal Labor Party guy through and through.  Whatever personal principles the guy may have, he's happy to keep them under wraps if that'd be inconvenient for Labor.  This has been especially obvious since the 2019 election, when Bill Shorten went in with a fairly ambitious, for Australia centre-left program.  And you know, Geordies was all in on advocating for it.  Then, after the election loss, he was replaced with Anthony Albanese, who immediately took a sharp turn to the right, collaborating with the Liberals a whole bunch too.  Yet Geordies is still just as much of a Labor Party guy.  He may occasionally express some minor disagreement with them, but he's never going to actually advocate against them, especially not on the federal level.  There is a big reason why a Labor Party guy like him is attacking the AUWU, or at least why other Labor surrogates like Van Battam are piling on.  It's certainly not out of a genuine concern for wrongs committed by the AUWU, or because it's wrong for there to be a union for unemployed workers.  It's because their legal structure and non-participation in the official compulsory arbitration system could represent a threat to the Labor Party if others pick up on it.  You might have noticed that in Jordy's video, he focuses a whole lot on the fact that the AUWU are not an officially registered union, and not part of the ACTU, as if that's some sort of huge smoking gun point against them.

            "text": "As a matter of law, the AUWU is an incorporated association.  Ye shall be judged on the AUWU's very own guiding principles, which are as follows.  One.  Solidarity.  Solidarity with who exactly, comrades?  Actual unions that, unlike the little revolutionary cosplay convention you've got going on, secured both job seeker and job keeper?  The Labor Party that's doing everything it can to clean up the robo-debt fiasco?  Two bodies that, in tandem, have given us some of the lowest unemployment rates in the developed world? ",

            "text": "but those are actually good things.  You see, Geordies nor anyone else who's way too deep into the Labor Party will ever talk about this, but back in the 80s and early 90s under Hawking Keating, Labor made a series of deals with the ACTU and corporate representatives that created the compulsory bargaining system that we have today.  in exchange for allegiance from those corporations, the ACTU and the unions that are under them.  The present system that we have of officially registered unions, the vast majority of them under the umbrella of the ACTU with strong government regulation and control over union activity to ensure that unions do not become too inconvenient for businesses is a result of those accords.  Of course, the Liberals took this system and made it even harsher in the Howard years.  But Labor are the ones who set it up, enabling that in the first place, and it benefits them the most.  Thanks to this, union power has been absolutely demolished.  Membership is abysmal at about 15% of all workers, when before it was about 50%.  because most unions primary purpose is now to keep workers under control.  And well, that's just not very appealing to them, is it?  That is why Geordie's and his mates focus so much on the fact that the AUWU is not an officially registered union.  They don't want you to think about the fact that a union does not get power from being officially registered, rather that they get that power from their membership.  and this is what allows them to take action.  They only want you to strike or take industrial action on the Labor Party's terms, which by extension are the very terms of the employers that they collaborate with.  It's not unionism, it's corporatism.  Strikes that you have to apply for permission to engage in.  that must be for reasons that the government deems acceptable, and only during enterprise bargaining periods.  It's an utterly ridiculous level of control, and it even violates international agreements on union rights.  It wasn't always like this.  Unions used to be far more independent.  They were strong, they were bold, they were much bigger.  They would take technically illegal actions and win all the time.  And that is why Labor wanted to bring them under control.  That is why they want to delegitimize any organization that operates outside of this system, which through the ACTU, they have a lot of control over.  Most unions now serve the Labor Party and the bosses.  That doesn't mean that people in unions or the people who run them are guilty here.  There is no shortage of genuine people in these unions who do everything they can to help.  It's just the way that the system is set up.  It's far bigger than any individual involved in it.  The many, many good people within it would be able to do far more without these corporatist limitations.  Any union that operates within the system is pretty much doomed to be consumed by it.  And as long as we don't challenge the system, it's gonna stay the same.  So how could we challenge it then?  Well, the simplest thing to do would be to preference labor further down in seats that have better challenges, or much better, by organizing and taking action outside of it, including in ways that may be technically illegal, like the utter Chad unions from 40 to 50 years ago used to.  That is exactly what Labor and their die-hard supporters want to keep us from thinking about.  Now, I'm not actually sure if Jordies is smart enough to have thought about it this deeply.  He probably just thinks, AC2U equals Labor equals good, and was motivated to make his video on the matter because his honor was being besmirched on Twitter more than anything else.  But he serves the Labor Party's interests all the same, either way.  The pile-on from smarter Labor operators and supporters, who do actually understand what is at stake here, shows that.  For further information, I have a much longer and more detailed video on the topic that goes into the history of it all, which should be on the screen right now.  Like there.  You should click it and watch it.  That's about it.  Bye. ",
