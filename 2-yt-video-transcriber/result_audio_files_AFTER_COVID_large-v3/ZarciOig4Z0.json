I mean, for sure we'll be respectful, but I'm not sure that's a lawful sign.  Hey, John.  You're a sworn officer?  No, sir.  We were... doing a tour of Marietta, so in the government facilities today.  And what we're going to be doing is going to all kind of public government buildings and just talking with the employees and maybe officers.  So we saw that this building is here and we walked up to it and I noticed you have signs on the door that say no recording.  without express permission?  That's not up to me to decide.  No, I know, but is this a public area?  Like, would a member of the public go in here?  I honestly don't know.  I can ask the sergeant if he wants to speak with you, but I can't actually answer that.  Yeah, that'd be great.  Okay.  Because I don't want to be disrespectful and just walk in when I see that sign.  So, anyway, that'd be great.  Thank you.  One second, okay?  Uh-huh.  Hey, how you doing, sir?  All right.  Yeah, we are doing a tour, really, of all the facilities.  And Marietta right here is like government building row, it seems.  And so obviously we saw this building.  I had looked it up on the map.  I thought this was a regional youth detention center.  That's up the street.  That's up the street.  OK, so we'll check that out.  But while we were just walking around here, we noticed the visitor center.  So we want to come and visit, see what kind of services are offered, that kind of thing.  And I see that right here.  It says public entry.  Yep.  But if we close this door, it says you need express permission to video or audio record.  That is correct.  Do you know 42 USC and what happened?  I'm not going to discuss the merits of that statement.  I'm only here to enforce it.  So you're welcome to video out here.  Yeah.  Record out here.  But you're not allowed to do it inside.  If you do, you'll be arrested for criminal trespass, and then you can argue the merits with the judge.  So instead of enforcing the law, you... Do you have any other questions about our policy?  I'm not arguing the law.  I wasn't.  I was just asking a question.  So if you want me to ask a question, please don't interrupt me when I'm doing something.  Have a nice day, sir.  Okay.  So the visitor center wasn't very friendly.  Hey, how you doing?  We're just in Marietta today on like government building row here.  I guess there's tons of stuff.  How you doing, sir?

And sometimes just the fact that you bring a camera, that you go into places like this, and people who are... sworn by oath to protect those rights will tell you that you can't do something that the constitution affords all of us the right to do okay and so sometimes it's just an education thing that what we do we do this all over georgia and we have no ill will to government.  part of this will be used as a social studies project for my daughter uh her class project.  and so usually you know like The government staff will have you go to a DDS and somebody behind the counter will say, hey, you can't do this.  And sometimes they'll have to, somebody over them will have to say, hey, actually, this is the First Amendment.  right.  They can do this.  This is kind of like when we were in school and the principal would slip into the class and, like, stand at the back.  Right.  You know what I mean?  The whole point was they didn't call the teacher and be like, hey, you got your best, you know, lesson plan, you know, for this tomorrow.  That's what... the first amendment freedom of press gives responsibility to civilians to do.  Do you know what I'm saying?  There's no other public job that the ball, I say boss, like it's a adversarial thing, but like somebody who was tasked for oversight, isn't showing up so that you get most prepared out in the warehouse when you're smoking and you shouldn't have been, or, or you're doing a great job and that's what you should have been doing.  This is, that's what this is about.  Um, some of the, sometimes we go in buildings, we, you know, document what county services you can do.  Like you can file a complaint here.  You can do tax assessor stuff here.  And so it's educational.  But a lot of times what happens is people.  Who don't know the law and want to act like they do will come out and really have a hard time understanding that this is the responsibility of citizens.  Now, in our daily course of life, not a lot of people have the time to go do this.  But in order for us, the same laws that keep me in check, keep you guys in check.  Right.  So it's a quid pro quo.  Right.  You have to be out here overseeing all of us.  You're overseeing us and the public.  by right and duty per.  the first amendment is supposed to be out here doing this kind of stuff.  right you know and some people have a real problem with it.  and we don't.  we love law enforcement.  we just don't want people to be accosted when they come into a government facility where it's owned by the public.  right.  and and the people who work for the public are like hey get off my property.  you know what i mean.  it's not really supposed to be that way.

Because I like to do that for folks who have... a policy to do it to see if they have a problem with it or okay nice to meet you.  what about you sir?  yes sir it is cold but it's good to be moving around when it's cold.  it absolutely is.  my question was knowing uh our rights that are protected by the first amendment freedom of press anywhere that is public access on a government building because it's public property.  the 11th Circuit, 42 USC, Smith vs.  Cumming, George has already said, if the public can go in there, you can go in there with a camera and it also can't be deemed suspicious activity for just having a camera because night circuits already said any anybody with a camera is part of free press.  so i went up to the visitor center.  there's a ton of government buildings around here so we were just going to go and document for our own purposes.  uh while also using this for a social studies project for my daughter who's in school.  um but there's a sign.  but all signs on on the visitor center says public entry but then it also has do not audio video record.  That's a violation of the First Amendment.  to have somewhere posted as public entry and then say that you can't go in and video and record.  It's not lawful.  So I'm wondering why there are instructions.  to trample that right and to ask people our demand because you come up to a center like this you guys all have guns.  last thing i want to do is like piss you guys off right.  so so by threat of just the very nature of what you guys equip yourself with in public it's a threat so that somebody can't exercise their right.  i'm wondering why that happens here at these buildings.  I think in these bills, as far as the jail, this is a security issue.  Can I come closer so I can hear what you're saying?  It's a security issue.  This is the jail.  Yeah, no, I figured.  And it doesn't say public entry here.  I'm just saying that.  Visitor center is a public lobby where you could go in and I could ask about somebody that I knew here.  I could potentially get them out of jail.  So that's a public place.  So to have whoever the sergeant or person in control up there meet me at the door and not want to even engage with a good citizen who's wondering why this violation is occurring, that was disappointing.  And what did they tell you?  They said they had no comment to whether it was public.  I asked that since it says public, why can't I go in a video record when the courts say that we can?  And they said, well, if you come in here, then I'm going to.  I don't know if you say to take me to jail, but he would trespass me.  And that when I get to court, I could argue the merits of the law with the judge.  So when you're supposed to be enforcing the law and you don't know the law.  Or even worse, you know the law and don't care about the law.  That seems obtuse.  You know, that seems overreaching and just not how this is supposed to work.  We do it for many reasons.  Sometimes stories get picked up.  Yeah, some of this will be edited in a way that she can use it for a class project.  But there are many things that I do this for and being a member of the press, such as yourself, when you're not in uniform, you want to walk around just for your own purposes.  You can go anywhere in public.  Just like if somebody was in public juggling, you couldn't really walk up to him and be like, Hey man, why are you juggling?  What you here for?  It should be the same thing when you walk on a public grounds in a public accessible place with a camera, it shouldn't be like, Oh shit, here's, here's, there's another camera, you know?  Oh, yeah.  I don't respond like that.  No, not you necessarily, but it garners that type of aggression.  I mean, you know, it's on camera.  The guy didn't cost me or threaten me physically or anything like that.  He just wasn't very helpful.  His answer wasn't good enough for you?  Or what you needed for him?  No, his answer wasn't lawful.  And he's a law enforcement.  That's the disconnect.  Right?  So you're telling people things that are unlawful when you're wearing a badge and you're supposed to be enforcing law.  You know what I'm saying?  But we're not here to make a scene or be ugly or have any ill will.  I love officers, and I'm thankful.  I just want to see when people don't know the law and they've sworn oath to uphold the law, that's kind of your job, right?  It shouldn't be like the citizen is now like, hey, let's walk up on him or her or whoever and treat them like, Anything other than a consensual contact, you know, it's not like, oh, you're under suspicion because you have a kid.  That's not how it works, man.  We were in the mall and I was shopping or something.  You wouldn't come up to me and be like, hey, man.  size shirt you wearing?  you got your id.  you know what i mean like.  it just doesn't work like that.  it's the same thing.  sorry this mask sucks.  anyway you guys have been super cool.  i would ask you if you guys have uh someone here in authority that could walk me up to that building and let me in the public access.  because last thing i want to do is i would never try to force my way when i got a guy who's giving me unlawful orders.  but maybe somebody could go up there and say hey look you know it's it's totally lawful for these guys to be in here and record.  So we're going to escort this gentleman in and just let him take a look around because that's what the Constitution allows.  Well, generally how that works, even when we have our news media and everything, what we do is you get permission from the court, the magistrate judge, and if they give permission, they'll send it back to us, to our admin, and then we'll let you go.  Now, I understand that that's the rules that you guys like to go by, right?  but it doesn't trump the law.  You know what I mean?  Like I could make, you can make a rule that you don't like chewing gum in there, but if it was a law that you could chew gum in there, it wouldn't matter.  Somebody could just walk in and chew gum.  And if you're just enforcing the law, you couldn't be like, man, I'm going to give them a hard time because they broke our rule.  They're actually legal law abiding citizens that shouldn't be infringed on.  You should just let, you know what I mean?  Just like if I was, Wearing a dress.  You know what I mean?  It's the same thing.  Unfortunately, right now, we have to go by our policies and procedures.  If you get... What's your name?  I'm sorry.  Lieutenant Gordon.  Lieutenant Gordon.  Okay, thanks.  And we just have to follow the policy and procedures we were given.  Okay, so if somebody walked in, not there because it doesn't say public, but there where it says public and started recording, how... how far would you take the violation of their rights like?  would you?  would you handcuff them like they were a criminal?  would you try to treat them like that like they were actually breaking a law when they weren't breaking a law?  yeah we're pretty much answering all your questions so we're done.  okay come on you have a good day.  okay i have a good one.  okay I mean, sir, do you think that I was being unreasonable?  I mean, that's how you lose your liberties.  You just allow it to happen.  You don't question it.  There's a way to question it so that lawful remediation can take place and hopefully citizens see.
