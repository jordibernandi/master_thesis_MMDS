Most of the cases were thrown out for lack of standing, which is a procedural way of not actually hearing the question.  There were several states in which the law was changed by the Secretary of State and not the state legislature.  To me, those are clearly unconstitutional.  And I think there's still a chance that those actually do finally work their way up to the Supreme Court.  Courts traditionally and historically don't like to hear election questions.  But yes, were there people who voted twice?  Were there dead people who voted?  Were there illegal aliens who voted?  Yes, and we should get to the bottom of it.  I'll give you an example.  In my state, when we had a Democrat secretary of state, she refused, even under federal order, to purge the rolls of illegal voters.  We got a Republican secretary of state, and he purged the rolls.
