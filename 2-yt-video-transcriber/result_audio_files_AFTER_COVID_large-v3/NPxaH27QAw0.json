            "text": "shall not be unpunished.  The wicked shall not be unpunished.  So now even though they're talking about we want to make good, we want to get reparation, the Mosai is still going to bring judgment on the earth.  It's too late.  It's too late for America to ready.  It's too late for America to ready.  It's too late for America.  The book of Job, chapter 9, verse 24.  The earth.  The what?  The earth.  The whole entire planet earth.  Come on.  It's given into the hand of the wicked.  It's given into the hand of the wicked.  That's why they pass these laws.  Come on.  Look at my back.  Give me the ABC.  Read that again.  The earth is given into the hand of the wicked.  The whole entire planet earth is given into the hand of the wicked.  Come on.  He covereth the faces of the judges thereof.  Because you realize in America, the vibration of America is throughout the whole planet earth.  Everybody wants to come from different cultures.  They want to come where?  They want to come to America.  It's not only that.  It's how people, like when they say the N-word, N-here, N-there, they really... they don't really understand what the meaning of when they say that.  Like when a white person says the N-word, they don't know the meaning of it.  Until they look back at what really goes on and really did happen, and they're bringing it back to a new century, which is 2020, which is now.  It doesn't make any sense.  Do you realize that the disciples were born niggers in the past?  The disciples that fall apart?  Okay, we can bring that into the Bible.  Read that.  The book of Acts, chapter 13, verse 1.  Now there were in the church that was in Antioch certain prophets and teachers as Barnabas and Simeon.  that was called nigger.  That was called what?  Neither.  Neither, which means what?  It means black.  Okay, so the disciples, it's proven also that the disciples were men of color.  So what you're going to find out?  if you've been lied to, look what they're teaching for little children.  I know, I know.  So how can America be blessed by God?  Exactly, exactly.  If you don't like color people, you shouldn't be here.  This land is full of people.  If you're discouraged by that, you shouldn't be here.  You should go back where you came from.  Because you understand that even though you're in a biracial relationship, the heavenly call is not good.  I love you guys.  Huh?  I love Chocolate Man.  You what?  I love Chocolate Man.  The most I don't like, the most I don't like.  You know who your beautiful name is?  You know?  Might not, but.  Let me just put it back.  Because the most high never intended for interracial relationship.  Because why?  Your people have a different understanding.  You serve a different God.  When they say God bless America, you're not talking about the God of the Bible.  You're talking about Satan.  Okay, 2521.  The book of Genesis 2521.  And Isaac entreated the most high for his wife because she was buried.  What does it mean when a woman is bound?  She can't get pregnant.  Okay, so she was buried.  Come on.  And the Mosai was entreated of him.  So the Mosai asked the prayers and allowed her to get pregnant.  Come on.  Rebecca, his wife, conceived.  She conceived.  She got pregnant.  Come on.  And the children struggled together within her.  Not only did the Mosai allow her to get pregnant, but she had two babies in her womb.  Okay, come on.  And she said, if it be so, why am I dust?  Did she say what?  If it be so, why am I thus?  So she went to the Most High.  If you allow me to get pregnant, why is this thing happening?  What's going on?  Come on.  And she went to inquire of the Most High.  And the Most High said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb.  So these two children are going to be the fathers, the possessors of two separate nations.  Okay, come on.  And two manner of people.  Two what?  Two manner of people.  And that manner is some of what?  Characteristics.  okay mannerism we have different.  mannerism means what.  that's how you carry yourself right.  so read that again.  and two two nations are in thy womb and two manner of people shall be separated.  what shall be separated together?  separated And ivory.  Separated.  Chocolate swirl.  Separated.  He said they're going to be separated, come on.  From thy bowels.  Right.  And the one people shall be stronger than thee.  Shall be what?  Shall be stronger.  He says one people shall be stronger.  So in society they teach them what?  That all people are created equal.  But that's not true, of course, the Bible.  Right.  The white people are going to be stronger.  Showing that, come on.  Look at some of the things that happened to so-called black men and black women.  It's better men, it's better women in this country.  And we're still able to survive.  Okay?  When a white man loses money, what does he do?  He jumps off the building.  Okay?  He takes his life.  We shall be stronger than the other people.  And the elder shall serve the younger.  And the elder shall serve the younger.  That's a future prophecy.  And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.  There were twins in her womb.  There were twins in her womb.  They're not going to be identical twins.  And the first came out red.  Red.  came out.  what?  Red.  So what color are you?  Red.  And the first came out red.  The first came out.  what?  Red.  So listen, this is something that we got to teach you the truth in these last days.  Right.  Because you can lie to just like we would lie to.  We were taught that we were African.  We were Negroes.  We were black people.  Black lives matter.  What is that?  Okay, that's a Bible and a proverb.  So now you've got to be talking truth as well.  Okay, read that again.  And the first came out red all over like a hairy garment.  Like a what?  Like a hairy garment.  But the baby was red and hairy.  Okay, come on.  And they called his name Esau.  His name what?  Esau.  Your forefather's name is Esau.  Okay, he's the father of the Edomites.  Okay, come on.  And after that, came his brother out, and his head took hold on Esau's heel, and his name was called Jacob.  So now, Jacob came out, the natural color.  Now, why did they mention his color?  okay i'm a thank you.  i think you can look at that.  but you said you look like you know.  i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i. Because America's about to be destroyed.  So now you got to understand to yourself, there's going to be a new kingdom, a new ruling power on the earth.  Okay?  So you are looking at the one that's going to rule when the kingdom of God comes.  Okay?  Read that.  The book of Isaiah, chapter 49, verse 23.  And kings shall be thy nursing fathers.  Now the kings of the earth are considered.  who today?  You're Bill Gates.  Okay?  You're Donald Trump.  Okay.  But I mean, but these are the, these are the, but these are the people that represent your nation, right?  Even though you try to separate yourself, right?  Because now if you walk down the street Okay?  And if police stop you, what kind of description?  I'm going to run.  I'm going to run.  No, I'm saying your description.  You're not going to say, you know, on the radio we can see there's a Negro woman.  No, they're going to say a Caucasian woman, right?  That's what they're going to say, right?  Say that again.  And kings shall be thy nursing fathers.  Come on.  And their queens.  And what?  And their queens.  And their queens because it's something for privileges.  Right.  Right?  You have that privilege of your skin color.  That even though that you are ashamed of your people, you still reap the benefits of it.  Okay?  Do that again.  And their queens, thy nursing mothers, they shall bow down.  They shall what?  Bow down.  The Bible says that in these last days that you are supposed to bow down to the true service of God.  And you say you acknowledge that, right?  Are you willing to bow down before the service of the most high?  Bow down.  And queens shall be thy nursing mothers.  They shall bow down to thee with their face toward the earth.  Right, so all praise be to God and Abraham and Jacob for his mercy truly and good forever.  So this is what we talked about, putting things back in perspective of the true saints and the children of the Mosiah.  Okay.  So now you don't have to be worried about people looking down because that's going to be the future.  Right.  That's going to be the future.  All nations are going to have to bow down to our nation.  Okay.  Give me Revelation 13 verse 9.  Revelation 13 verse 9. book of revelation chapter 13 verse 9. even though joe biden said there's no way i'm going to pay these people back for slavery but guess what they're going to pay out of their heart?  if any man have an ear what if any man have an ear?  the bible says that any man have an ear come on let him hear him here.  come on he that leadeth into captivity that what leadeth into captivity?  you got movies like roots Made dingo, 12 years of the slave.  So what do you think that, because they talk about peace, that the Mosai forgot about 14 years of slavery?  Okay, the Mosai did not forget about that.  Read that again.  He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity.  Shall what?  Shall go into captivity.  Right, so the whole nation is going into slavery.  Thus saith the Mosai, thus saith the Bible.  Okay, we're not mad.  A lot of people say, oh, you guys are preaching hate.  All we're doing is bringing up the truth according to the Bible.  Bring out the truth, of course, as it is written verbatim.  We're not sugarcoating.  You're not.  Okay?  We're saying as it is written.  So we got to warn your people.  Let them know that, listen, they can't get you suspected.  Most times show the people.  Now you put your children of the father, okay?  Because the seed of the man carries the seed, determines the identity of the children.  Give me that in numbers 1 and 18.  Is that correct?  The book of Numbers, chapter 1, verse 18.  And they assembled all the congregation together on the first day of the second month.  And they declared their pedigrees.  Their pedigrees.  A lot of people hear the term pedigree used during what?  Like for ant or dog, right?  Pedigree.  A man is a different class, okay, than the identity.  Okay, read that again.  And they declared their pedigrees after their families.  After their what?  After their families.  After their families, come on.  By the house of their fathers.  The house of who?  Of their fathers.  The house of their fathers.  That's why when a woman gets married, what happens?  She takes on the man's last name.  What about the children?  They take on the father's last name.  So it's determined by the father.  So your children are okay.  You want another hand?  You might have some submission.  But the show of your faith today, I will remember you.  The more I spare my life to be in the kingdom, I will remember it.  Now, don't do that.  I will remember your faith today.  Okay, I will remember your faith today.  That's right.  Okay?  That's right.  Because the Mosiah gave us 12 tribes.  We got 12 tribes in Israel.  Okay?  We got more flavors than Baskin-Robbins in the nation of Israel.  Right, right.  We don't have to go to the other nations.  Give me Deuteronomy 7, verse 1.  Okay?  All right, I'll see you in captivity. ",
