And so we have to beseech God and beg God and just stay after him until God moves.  But the truth is God has already done everything.  And I use creation as an example, Adam and Eve, When he created them, he had anticipated every need that they had ever had.  He had already created their food.  He had already created their air to breathe.  I believe it's the same for the whole human race.  And especially for us in Christ, when you get born again, everything you will ever need was placed inside of you in the new birth.  You literally have the fullness of the Godhead dwelling in you bodily.  Colossians chapter 2, verses 9 and 10. ",

This is Bill Johnson's favorite writer, favorite pastor of all time.  His collected writings were published by Kenneth Copeland Publications.  But the truth is, this guy was actually a fraud.  He was a heretic, a false teacher, and an absolute fraud who lied pathologically.  Let's look at a book that was published by Kenneth Copeland and just read a little bit of what he said.  There is a touch there that I have always blessed God for.  The Word says it took place while he prayed.  While he was praying, he was transfigured.  It reveals the power of prayer.  It reveals the quality in the nature of man to become identified in oneness with God, so that the glories of God are not shining upon him from heaven, but radiation out of him.  God resident in man, shining forth.  It reveals again that man is the divinest instrument in all God's creation for revelation of God, that the living Spirit of God energizes him, leaps from him as the lightnings.  Dear brother, dear sister, let me encourage your heart.  Everything in the Word of God that ever was possible to the Lord Jesus Christ is likewise possible to the Christian.  God never meant to establish Christians on one plane and Christ on another.  He purposed by God's grace and by the Holy Ghost to come into our heart to lift us up, to develop us, and bring us up into God until we stand together on Christ's plane.  Not Christ coming down to our debased state, but our debased condition giving way to the divine operation of the Holy Ghost in our life until we stand exalted in the Lord Jesus Christ, Christ conquerors, Christ revealers.  Basta!  You may be wondering, where did these false teachers like John G. Lake or like Todd White or Chris Vallotton or Andrew Womack, all these guys seem to be saying the same thing, that we will be like God.  Where did they get this from?  Well, let's give credit where credit is due, shall we?  But the serpent said to the woman, you will surely not die, for God knows that when you eat of it, your eyes will be opened and you will be like God. ",
