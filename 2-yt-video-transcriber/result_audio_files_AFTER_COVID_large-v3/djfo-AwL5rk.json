            "text": "This is a video that I have filmed and edited and scrapped at least twice by now.  But I knew I wanted to speak on this topic.  I don't have a script in front of me so this is all coming from the heart so I apologize if any of it is messy.  I have loved Harry Potter since I was a kid.  As you can see by my Luna Lovegood poster, my wand from Ollivanders, and you can't see but behind all of this is a Slytherin house edition of the Philosopher's Stone.  I have loved harry potter for so long.  it was one of my first fandoms.  it was one of the first.  you know draco hermione was one of my first problematic ships.  i i read the smut with every ounce of my being and i have spent a lot of my adult years dissecting harry potter thinking about what it says about race and culture and dealing with the problematic nature of a lot of things in the text.  however considering all that jk rowling has been saying and what she has been doing i have decided that i'm quitting harry potter.  and when i say i'm quitting harry potter i mean that i have decided to financially creatively and basically anything that could be giving Harry Potter any attention to take that out of my day-to-day life unless I'm covering it for like a journalistic reason on the Mary Sue simply because I do not want to support a woman who is using her power, her clout, and her authority as a children's writer to propagate this transphobic language and drivel into the internet.  And as much as I love Harry Potter, I love trans people more.  And if I'm gonna say that I'm an ally to trans people, it cannot just be when it's convenient, when it is, Easy.  It has to be what I don't give my money to, what I don't give my time to.  And the fact of the matter is, is that as Lindsay Ellis put it in her video about Death of the Author and J.K.  Rowling, there is no way to separate J.K.  Rowling from Harry Potter at this point.  I mean, Harry Potter and her have the same birthday.  Hermione Granger is her favorite character, and there's almost no way to read Hermione, especially when you get to the storyline about spew and that maternalistic way that she talks and belittles the house elves while trying to elevate them, to separate that from Rowling's ideology that she's been spewing online.  And as difficult as it may be for a lot of us, I think that if we say that we are allies to trans people, and I'm not, what trans and non-binary folk decide to do in their own way is their own business since they are the ones being targeted.  I'm not going to dictate to them what they should do.  For those of us who are cis allies, however, I think it is important that we show economic and social, you know, solidarity.  Don't go to Harry Potter World.  Don't buy any more Harry Potter books.  Don't do the fanfiction.  I mean, Harry Potter fanfic has been so successful and prolific over the years.  I mean, it is still, I believe, if not the top, one of the top book fandoms on fanfiction.net.  It is beautiful.  And I totally get why people want to reclaim it, why people want to say that it belongs to us, the fans.  And that is a sentiment that I would co-sign.  if JK Rowling were less popular, if she were less powerful, if she were like a smaller, more niche author, I'd be like, you know what?  Like you're problematic.  If she were like a Laurel K. Hamilton.  So, you know, if you want to problematically read the new Anita Blake, do that.  But Harry Potter is hard to ethically consume.  and i know that puts a lot of queer fans and fans period and fans of color who have done the work who have done the work in trying to dissect and salvage as much of this fandom as they could.  and that's work that we did that we took on because we loved this story we loved this world we supported it we believed in it and i think that that was good work.  i don't think anything that she has done has invalidated that work.  but top of every fanfic what is the disclaimer?  this does not belong to me.  this belongs to jk rowling warner brothers.  i have friends who have harry potter tattoos.  i mean if nyako takahashi came out the other day and said some transphobic i would be in a titty because i would have to like laser this sailor moon tattoo off of my arm because it's just like it's.  it's terrible.  this is what that what we're dealing with right now.  but i think that It's important to make a stand with your politics and that when we say trans lives matter, it has to be political.  It cannot just be something that you say for social media.  And that's difficult and that's hard.  And I personally am not going to judge what other people choose to do.  that's not what i see as my place but i think that as a fan as a deep fan who loves the series.  i don't even want to discuss it on this platform anymore right now.  to be quite honest i had a whole video that i was planning to do about hermione and how she's not the feminist icon some people think she is at times.  but honestly there is no way for me to make that video and rowling's transphobic fingers wouldn't be all over it.  so it's just not worth it to me to even do that and i know people write about it like trope.  anatomy just did a really good video about cat block harry.  i'm not going to criticize what other people do but i know that for myself.  for myself There are a lot of things that I as, you know, an ordinary person am complicit in that I have no control over.  What my tax dollars go to, the fact that I live, you know, on colonized territory.  There's so many things that I can't control in this political system.  There's a finite amount of money that I can give.  There are so many things that I'm able to do.  There is only so much I can do.  But when you can do something, it is important to try.  And the least I can do is not support a writer who spreads transphobic ideology and paints it as wanting to protect trans people and children and women in this disgusting way.  And the thing you said about people with autism, it's just, it truly is disgusting.  I don't know what to do.  And it hurts to say this on a shallow level because I remember as a kid, I like wrote to one of those JK Rowling fan sites and I said I loved her because I did.  I loved her.  She was a role model to me.  She's one of the people that made me want to become a writer.  I'll never be able to completely detach my love of Harry Potter from her, but I can tell you, every time I look up in my living room and see my copy of The Beetle and the Bard, I wanna throw it across the room.  The other day I was working, after I worked out, after I showered, I went to go get a t-shirt and it was my Slytherin t-shirt, I didn't wanna put it on.  I didn't want to put on my Slytherin t-shirt.  I have Ravenclaw hair right now and I was so disgusted.  There are so many writers that do the work that are supportive of our communities that I just do not see the point in supporting one who doesn't.  I'm not interested in doing it and as long as she holds the IP rights.  And the thing about it too is that there's been racism issues in Harry Potter for a minute.  And I am very aware of that.  And I've been on this boat of saying that J.K.  Rowling ain't shit because she ain't been shit for a while.  This is the last straw.  I think that's okay.  I don't regret the money I've spent on Harry Potter.  I don't regret loving Harry Potter.  I don't regret any single moment of joy that I got from.  Harry Potter is mine and I keep that and that belongs to me and she can't take that away from me, but she's not getting my money ever again.  Period.  If every single one of us who believes that trans lives matter stop buying harry potter merchandise.  don't support the future.  you know fantastic beast movies that we make those choices that will matter.  i do believe that maybe i'm just too much of a superman fangirl but i believe that i believe that if we really believe in this issue, then we have to be political about it and make these choices.  And this is my choice.  Again, not gonna speak, as I said probably four times already, not gonna judge what anyone else does, but I am quitting Harry Potter.  And I'm okay with that.  I've made my peace with it.  I got my Tamora Pierce.  And I think anyone else who wants to quit it, you will be okay.  There are plenty of problematic faves for you to have that are not transphobic.  We will be okay.  Our memories are still precious.  One day I will absolutely wear that Slytherin t-shirt again, but I will not be spending another red cent on Harry Potter.  Thank you. ",
