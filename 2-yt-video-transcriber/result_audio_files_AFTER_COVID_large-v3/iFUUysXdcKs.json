Okay.  So she was saying the N word all day long.  She wanted to hit these young men.  for simply because of the color of their skin.  They have these kinds of people out here in society.  Now this is in Oregon, Ohio.  Uh, just so people can know exactly what it said.  Now this woman's, you know, real name is Angela Baker.  Oh, she's 42 years old, but we've seen more and more people like this crawl up from underneath their rocks and act this way.  Because this society is just really having a, um, awakening.  And also at the same time, people that feel like this particular Karen here, um, they got to show out as well because they do not like the changes happening in America.  They don't.  They wanted to go back to the old America.  They want the status quo.  They want people to know their place.  They want, you know, people to say, well, it's just the way it is.  And we got to deal with that.  And, and things are slowly changing and they're not liking that.  And some people, um, like this particular one is acting out and she got herself arrested, which is a good thing.  The cop that was in this video, Can't say nothing bad about this particular cop.  That's how cops supposed to act.  This is good police work.  Now, if all the police in America will follow this example, we wouldn't be having any conversations about defunding the police or anything like that.  Um, but outside of maybe these particular cops or what they're doing here to arrest this one, um, unfortunately the rest, a lot of them, you know, like I said, they are, we wouldn't even call them police.  We would call them race soldiers.  So, maybe, you know, this particular woman, they definitely carries a, uh, potential prison sentence, uh, these particular charges and she needs to go to jail because you trying to hit people with a car because you don't like them because they're black.  Okay.  No one says that you have to like black people.  And listen, I'm cool with that.  If you don't like me, you say, listen, I don't like you because you're black.  Okay.  There's a lot of people that's not going to like me outside of even this.  They go, people are not going to like my personality.  I mean, I like the way I talk, I look, whatever the case may be.  And I'm good with that.  But just because you don't like someone by the color of their skin doesn't mean you go and harm them.  Listen, if anything, I'm staying away from you.  I mean a true person to actually have a hatred for somebody, they will say, I'm going to move myself from wherever these people congregate.  Okay, I'm going to move to a town or a state.  that's maybe 90 plus percent people that look like me.  I'm going to be there and it's going to be once in a blue moon.  I run into those kinds of people.  We have cities and States in this country where a person like this one, um, can actually go to, like you go to places like Idaho and Wyoming and you know, those, those kinds of States.  Maine is another state.  I mean, just based off of what I've researched, she can go up there and she would probably hardly ever see a black person.  It'd be like once in a blue moon.  But instead of doing that, because then, you know, trying to remove yourself from the situation, no, you'd rather do something like this.  So it's not that you just don't like black people.  Thing is you want to be violent and when you're being violent, well now you're going to jail and I don't feel bad for you and I hope you can't get commissary or bail.  But let me a comment guys.  I don't know what you think about, you know, this particular Karen that we see here that wants to try to, you know, hit people for no other reason than the color of their skin.  mean. ",
