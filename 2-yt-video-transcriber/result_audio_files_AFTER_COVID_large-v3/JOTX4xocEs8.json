I just kept hearing about it and I I've never seen the video.  I finally just saw it.  someone emailed me a link and Wow I just want to say I've never been a fan of hers even though she claims to be conservative and fighting for conservative issues.  I never was a fan of hers at all.  I stopped listening to her after she defended abortion a couple years back and stated she was pro-choice.  So that's why I didn't see the video that she posted.  But now I've seen it and I'm going to comment on it after a message from my sponsor. ",

Bank of America says it'll get to $3,000 in 18 months.  Thomas Kaplan predicts a 10-year bull run could push gold past $5,000 an ounce.  If you're sick of low returns and volatility, it's time to look at gold and silver.  Choose precious metals with Noble Gold and move to an IRA or 401k this month. ",

            "text": "So Tommy Loren is, it appears that she is either brokenhearted.  It looked like maybe someone dumped her recently or it may be all the birth control.  I don't know what's going on.  if it's, She's getting older now, and she's having one of those getting older kind of crises.  I don't know what it is, but she's very upset about something, and it looks like she wants to blame all of her bad choices on men.  She rants and goes on and on about how men are not living up to the responsibility that men are supposed to live up to, basically serving and pleasing her and her friends.  she states that her and her friends are attractive successful ambitious go-getters and they all have the same problems with men.  she states that her friends are from all over the country ranging in ages of early 20s to mid 30s.  none of them can seem to find a good man.  they all have the same exact relationship problems regardless of race body size or you know what city and state they reside.  and She actually says that, and this is her words, you have to look at this and wonder, it might not be us.  It might be you talking about men.  I thought the opposite.  I thought if you continue to have the same problems with men, at what point do you say it might be me?  What am I doing wrong?  Where's the self-reflection?  But anyway, she goes on and says that men are trash.  She uses that term quite a bit throughout the rant.  And she also states that I am not a feminist.  Don't take this as another feminist rant.  I love men.  I think men are great.  I think men have failed themselves and they failed us, but I think they're great.  just want to help you out.  so I don't think you're helping men out.  I think you're being a giant.  see she says that she's tired of her and her friends dealing with trashy men and they're not gonna put up with it and she has a very special list of things that all men need to do to be with a woman like her and her friends high-value successful women with standards and She states that her and her friends will never, ever chase any man.  Now, this is my thoughts on it.  Folks, Tommy Loren has been with a lot of different men in a lot of different cities, and still she cannot find a man that wants to stick it out with her, marry her.  You know, be with her forever.  There's always some kind of problem and they break up.  You know, it never works out.  At what point is Tommy going to say, maybe it's not men.  Maybe it's me.  Maybe I need to fix me.  You know, so, you know, I think there needs to be more self-reflection, more personal responsibility.  um you know if all these women are having the same problems they're obviously making some bad choices and they can't sit there and blame men.  that's what these feminists do they they believe in feminism.  they live the lifestyle and when it doesn't work out the way it was promised which it never does they they end up old and bitter and blaming men for all their problems instead of blaming themselves.  it's all about personal responsibility.  I think also that her thinking that she and her friends are better than every other woman out there and too good for men, not very attractive.  That's not an attractive quality at all.  And that's the, you know, that's what I got out the video.  She kept going on and on about how her, her and her friends are better than every other woman out there.  They're the only successful ones.  They're the most attractive ones.  they're the most deserving of a good man, but yet they, none of them can find a good man.  You know, I found a good man and I've been having my good man for over 15 years.  And we've been married for 13 years coming up next month.  My mom, my grandmother that raised me has a good man coming up on 50 years of marriage.  All my aunts on that side, found good men and they've been married for decades and decades as well.  my sisters have a good man.  both of them are settled down and married long-term.  so why is it that these attractive young girls like Tommy Lauren can't seem to find a good man?  well they need to look at themselves.  if they fix themselves and take responsibility for their poor choices and decisions then the whole dynamic will change.  you can't blame men for all your problems.  I mean, I don't even know what else to say about it.  This is typically what happens to women when they buy into feminism.  She can sit there and say all day that she's not a feminist, she's conservative, but everything that she does says different.  You know, your actions is what counts.  It's not your words.  You can say things all day long.  It's your actions that speak louder.  So, that's my opinion on it.  I think Tommy needs to fix herself.  I think she has a mighty big head.  She's getting older now and the cute little Barbie doll and the surgery is not going to hang around forever.  At some point, you're going to have to bring something good to the table.  besides, you know, blonde hair and a tan.  So... That's my opinion on it.  Like the video if you did.  Subscribe if you want to hear more.  And I'll catch y'all back on my next video.  Bye. ",
