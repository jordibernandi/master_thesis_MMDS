            "text": "And another one of my predictions comes to utter fulfillment.  It is the middle of the night in Virginia, and my phone begins blowing up a couple of people messaging me about a dirtbag by the name of Matthew Heimbach who apparently has joined an anti-white organization called parallel networks darkness upon darkness.  of course they call it light upon light but we never give them the names of their taking because they always name their endeavors the opposite of their true intentions.  Well, who is this Matthew Heimbach?  This is a story of a shameless self-promoter who put himself ahead of our people's well-being, who never cared about white well-being, who never cared about recapturing our destiny, who never cared about the weakest members of our community, our children.  our elderly and our sick.  he never cared about these people though he paid plenty of lip service to it over the years didn't he?  this anti-white porpoise scumbag ten years ago decided to start something called the white students union at towson university in maryland And that is when I met him for the first time.  And I could tell from our first interaction that this person was not putting the well-being of our people first, that he was putting himself first.  He wanted in all ways to animate the ne'er-do-well, the bad guy himself.  the antagonist in the anti-white narrative.  He wanted in all ways to be that so that he could get the attention of the media, so that he could get the attention of the school's media, the greater media, the faculty, the teachers.  He wanted nothing more than attention.  If he cared about white people at all, it was ancillary, it was distant.  I could tell that he had no character, that he was deeply disturbed, that he was immoral, that he was unethical, that he was selfish.  Many people in the white positive sphere have said over the years that we need somebody who is selfish because they will push all of us forward.  They will push our cause forward by pushing themselves forward.  Well, Matthew Heimbach and plenty of others are great examples of why we don't need selfish people.  We need selfless people.  We need, ladies and gentlemen, to reject people like Matthew Heimbach when they show up.  And that is why i got up out of bed to do a brief video to teach you all about the likes of matthew heimbach and those like him who are more concerned about themselves and getting attention for themselves than they are for the well-being of our people run from such individuals.  he didn't like anything I had to say about white well-being.  he knew the way he knew how to handle this and of course he didn't like what I had to say about advocating for white well-being because that was not going to get him the attention that he wanted.  no he was only going to get attention from the media if he played the media's bad guy if he played that bad guy in the anti-white narrative.  So many other people saw something wrong with this character as well, different reasons.  I predicted at that time, after that first meeting, that he was going to, at a minimum, embarrass us, that he was going to harm the white positive sphere and those genuine advocates for white well-being with his antics by playing the bad guy in their narrative.  And that, possibly more, that he would or potentially could engender violence, now I don't know if that came about or not, but certainly the anti-whites could use his video and audio of him speaking and say this is how they speak and that is why violence is done.  But most importantly and the reason why I had to speak with you all briefly in this video is that I said after that first meeting that since this individual is a self-promoter as soon as he is not able to garner himself attention from the establishment media by way of being the bad guy in the anti-white narrative, he will turn against us to garner attention from the regime's media.  And that is exactly what he has done.  He has joined this anti-white network.  He called himself in this video that I put at double speed because I'm getting back in bed in a moment.  He called himself right at the beginning.  He said that he was the face of organized hate.  And now he is fighting for anti-whitism.  He is fighting for all the races.  He is going to tell the world the truth about the white positive sphere and how awful it is now.  That is how this fat, repulsive, sickening bastard is going to get himself attention now.  He then went on to say that he was kicked out of some... organization and they called him a communist and then he quipped that if the red star fits saying now that he is a communist he is an anti-white.  he went on after the white student union to create the traditionalist workers party or something like this and then some national socialist group where he made a fool of himself again and again and the media put a microphone in his face and a recorder in his face again and again so they could get the audio the real life evidence of their anti-white narrative the bad guy from their story.  well i came across this bastard several more times and since i knew what kind of person he was or i'd formed my assessment in the beginning i knew that i didn't want to be alone in a room with him because somebody with no character some shameless self-promoter would say that conversations took place or that they didn't take place that events took place or that they didn't take place whatever it took to get attention for himself.  so i never allowed myself to be alone with him in those couple other times that I was at an event that he showed up at.  I never went to an event that he held because I wanted nothing to do with him.  But he showed up at events that I was at.  And each time he showed up, he rejected white well-being, my arguments for advocacy, for our people, the recapture of our destiny.  And every single time he had a new prescription, a new formula for affronting the masses more.  that's all it was.  he said it was for our people to do x y or z. for us that would be good but it was always a lie.  it was always to aggrandize him.  and so what do we have here with the dirtbag matthew.  You have somebody who is only thinking about himself, only thinking about himself when he started that student union, only thinking about himself when he started that other organization, Traditional Workers Party, only thinking about himself.  all of those times he stepped in front of those cameras, stepped in front of that reporter from the local newspaper, stepped in front of another movie maker.  He was thinking about himself.  All that it was was thinking about himself when he cheated with his friend's wife, his right-hand man's friend's wife.  It was always about Matthew Heimbach.  It had nothing to do with our people.  And now he has finally proven himself nothing but the dregs of society.  The gavel has fallen on him, and he has landed in the place where the dregs of society always end up, and that is anti-whiteism. ",
