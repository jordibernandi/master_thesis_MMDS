            "text": "In the age of social distancing, the Karen meme is enjoying a massive resurgence.  Karen, an annoying, interfering female adult who complains about everything.  You there?  Not social distancing.  Okay, Karen.  You there?  Not social distancing.  Who is it?  With who?  Stupid bitch, shut up.  Shut up, bitch.  Stupid bitch, shut up.  That's not social distancing.  She's literally sticking her arm out, putting herself closer to him.  That's not social distancing.  And yeah, I get the sanity of not congregating in huge groups of people, but this is two people in a field in the middle of nowhere.  The dude on the bike is sticking to the path.  He's the one traveling much faster.  If you're that paranoid about Corona, Karen, move out of the friggin' way.  Stupid bitch, shut up.  Karens all over the world are milking the opportunity to inflict their petty enforcement of personal behaviour on other people.  Hey, it's Corona time right now.  It's Corona time.  It's Corona time.  Hey, it's Corona time right now.  Okay, Karen.  Also, imagine how cooked her boyfriend has to be to encourage this.  Somebody wants the corona!  Oh, somebody wants the corona!  Yeah, and no doubt when you're getting pegged by your girlfriend, your face looks like this.  Oh, somebody wants the strap-on!  It's not six foot when convenient, it's six foot at all times!  Okay, Karen.  Yesterday in the park, I saw a kid with a stick doing exactly the same thing with the approval of his mother.  Karen.  Oh, hey, Ted.  Oh, hey, Marcus.  How are you?  Good.  Were you out for a little run?  Yeah, yeah.  Just did seven.  I might do another seven, you know?  Wow.  Yeah.  I don't want to hold you up.  Hey, let's grab dinner sometime.  I would love that.  All right.  You, me, Karen.  Good seeing you.  Absolutely.  I mean... 911, what's your emergency?  Hi, yeah.  I got a couple handshakers right in front of me.  Okay, sir, are they still in the vicinity?  Yeah, I'm staring at them right now.  Run.  I asked her to wear a fucking mask.  Like, seriously, woman.  Who won't wear your mask?  Who don't wear your gloves?  Who don't wear practice social distancing?  Wear your fucking mask.  Wear your gloves.  Yeah, okay, Karen.  I would like to speak to the manager of the coronavirus.  You gotta love these mask freaks.  Every day I'm out in the park, I haven't seen one elderly person wearing a face mask, which if they did would be totally understandable.  But the main demographic of mask wearers appears to be women aged 40 to 50.  And there's a name for that demographic.  Karen.  And if you're so paranoid about COVID, why are you throwing away the masks on the ground like trash?  Which then litter the fields and paths, potentially exposing other people to COVID.  Almost like you don't really care about COVID and you're just wearing the mask as a status symbol of obedience, which you can then use to lecture everybody else.  Wear your fucking mask, you impotent piece of shit!  I hope your kids get cancer!  Okay, Karen, a dude's neighbor, let's call her... Karen, called the police on him because he was exercising in his own front yard.  Your ass is grass.  Do you understand?  I'm done with this shit.  So, who are you looking out for?  this cop?  All right, I will.  I'll be looking over those cars.  You're supposed to be sheltered in place.  Go ahead, put me on social media.  You're a little punk.  Seriously?  Seriously, I called the cops.  Okay, Karen.  What happens when they, your neighbors, start breaking lockdown rules with the police receiving 200,000 tip-offs?  And I get it.  You don't have to be a Karen to recognize that hordes of drunk, idiotic teenagers having mass parties during the height of a global pandemic is pretty stupid.  But Karen isn't too concerned with that.  Karen's main concern is controlling your individual behavior, because it allows her to exercise petty authority and gives her otherwise meaningless existence a sliver of self-importance.  Get off this beach, it's unsafe.  You see that Walmart over there?  Go there.  You know the type.  Karen is just an adult hall monitor.  Her anxiety-ridden, red, puffy face looks like it's about to explode as she becomes righteously indignant while explaining the rules to you in an imperious, condescending tone.  And don't you dare call her Karen.  The Karen meme is everywhere, and it has become mired in sexism.  Okay, Karen.  This was the moment things climaxed Friday at the Norton Commons Amphitheater.  WLKY News confirmed that the man in the video is a local physician.  Witnesses say he and the woman he was with started cursing at them for improperly social distancing.  It's being investigated as a first-degree strangulation case.  Yeah, because a great way of educating teenage girls about social distancing is to strangle them.  Okay, Karen, two of my immediate neighbors had visitors this weekend.  Wanna party?  Okay, Karen.  The name of the principal running this school is Karen.  One boater passing by this weekend, though, said she was appalled at what she saw there.  Pamela Reid took these pictures while on a boat ride with her brother this weekend.  What she saw was a disregard for social distancing.  I don't like being the bad guy, but I felt that somebody had to step up.  Okay, Karen.  So, this guy in Michigan came up with this idea.  Check it out.  He and his wife, Karen, built a barrier.  You know, it gets the point across.  I'm Dr.  Karen.  Practice social distancing.  One of the side effects of lockdown is that many women are upset about not getting attention for five whole minutes.  Which is why some of them have tried to get on the news by wearing stupid, cumbersome costumes while shopping.  Karen in a bubble.  Extreme measures of self-isolation.  This one?  No, it's alright.  You're coming towards me.  No, it's alright.  Don't worry.  If I had it, you can't get it.  You're pretty safe in there.  No, no, no.  Honestly, she's really germaphobe.  Karen in a shark outfit.  Being called Karen.  Karen in a T-Rex outfit.  She's literally grabbing on that guy.  That's not social distancing, Karen.  Not social distancing.  But you know who wins in the end?  Karen, because just like in starzy East Germany, she has the authorities on her side.  Snitch hotlines to report your neighbours for not social distancing.  Robot dogs to enforce social distancing.  Face scanning cameras to enforce social distancing.  Tracking apps to alert the government if you've socialised with an unauthorised person.  Meanwhile, look at public transport in London and any major city.  It's never not going to be overcrowded.  The CEO of Heathrow Airport saying if social distancing was adhered to, the queue for large passenger planes would be one kilometer long.  Top chefs saying social distancing in kitchens is impossible, as it is in countless other professions.  Supermarket staff saying social distancing is virtually non-existent.  For a properly functioning society, social distancing is practically impossible.  Let's all stay inside until people never die again.  We were told social distancing was necessary for a limited time to flatten the curve and get back to normal.  And I supported it on that basis.  Now we're being told that social distancing is the new normal.  Forever.  Even though it can only ever be selectively enforced because it's totally unfeasible in the real world.  But you know who's going to enthusiastically take on the role of enforcing it against you?  Karen.  Not social distancing.
