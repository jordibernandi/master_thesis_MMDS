Unless you're gonna try to argue that there's a series of works one must have to abide by in order to be a Christian, but then you wouldn't be a Baptist Christian because that's not what that brand of Christianity teaches.  Jesus said in the Bible that works are dead, so why are you trying to judge Christians on their works?  Moreover, I think judge not lest ye be judged also ends up coming into play here.  Like, I'm not Christian, obviously.  The branding on my channel has demonstrated that pretty well.  But I was a Christian for a very long time.

The issue is that it's a matter of personal choice.  He's not going to try to intervene on that.  Because, like he rightfully said, he doesn't know what someone's personal story is.  I don't know if someone's using abortion as a method of birth control because they don't like using condoms, or if the abortion would be otherwise life-saving, if they're in poverty, or if being forced to have the child of an abuser would lock them into a relationship that they have no way out of.  These are all variables that I do not know where any individual is concerned, and neither do you.  The correct stance to take on that is to say it's not your business, and if you're empathetic enough, then maybe offer assistance where you can.  That is, in fact, a stance.

When talking about homosexuality in the Bible where the New Testament is concerned, most of the time you end up finding writings from Paul, but Paul is referencing writings from back in Leviticus.  His stance is informed by the older literature, but the literature in Leviticus doesn't necessarily mean homosexuality.  The language that was used in Leviticus can mean homosexuality, but it can also mean not abusing a woman's bed.  It can also be a passage against pedastry.  The fact of the matter is, there are at least six different interpretations of Leviticus, and we do not know which one the original author intended.  Jesus didn't apparently speak about homosexuality, and when Paul speaks about homosexuality, he is directly referencing those older scriptures, and all of us are fully divorced from the context of them, and to try to argue that you can put your thumb on any one meaning of Leviticus would be to pretend that you knew the author's thoughts.  And unless you've got a time machine, you don't have that.  But I noticed in your channel tags that you're a KJV-only Christian, so I can actually see where the confusion is.  When you use a version of the Bible based on manuscripts, which they themselves are removed about a thousand years from the events that they depict in their chapters, I can at least get why you have such a sloppy understanding of the Bible.

Because you've got two options.  You either have.  it's the proper thing to do to convert them to Christianity, or converting them is the improper thing to do, which would mean that the proper thing to do is let them burn in hell.  But given what I've seen thus far, I think that you would probably argue that the proper thing to do would be for them to burn in hell.  I don't actually have evidence of this, it's just a hunch that I'm gonna go on based on what I've seen so far.  But you remember how earlier I said that that controlling other people would come up again?  This is that.  Because there's a third option.  them converting to Christianity, but fundamentally changing who they are so that they can better fit your Christian paradigm.  Given that the first option, letting people into the church, isn't the one that you're going for, then the only options you have are conformity, specifically to your viewpoint of what Christianity is or should be, or eternal hellfire.  And if physical violence or conformity are the only options you're willing to give anybody, those aren't choices.  Those are ultimatums.  It's a double bind that can be a very efficient tool for an abuser.  Maybe, just maybe, you shouldn't use them. ",

So irreverence is showing a lack of respect for people or things that are generally taken very seriously.  But here's the thing.  Within Christian literature, a relationship with God should be just that, right?  A relationship.  And if in your personal relationship with God, you, and God in this case, are comfortable with language like that, then just like in standard human interaction, there should be nothing wrong with that.  Again, I am not a Christian, so I don't personally hold that this relationship is even a thing that I would be able to do, but if I did feel like I had a relationship with a god, I think that being able to use friendly terms that I use amongst other people that I love and care about would kind of be the norm.  Just because you think you have to speak about God in terms of awe and inspiration, because elsewise he'll spank you just a little too hard and not in the fun way, doesn't mean that other people can have a completely different type of relationship with their perception of God.

They are in fact Bible-believing Christians, they hold the Bible as true and authoritative on matters of faith, but yeah, they are Pentecostal, which comes with a shit ton of other problems that we can get into in a different video.  I didn't want to use this entire video standing their church.  I still think that this is an open door for abuse.  My issues come from when people take, well, issue with a particular brand of Christianity, but strawman it.  If you want to say that they're not Bible-believing Christians, well, they do believe the Bible.  They do hold it as an authority.  Their interpretation may be different than yours, and I have no way of saying which one of yours is more accurate.  I mean, I know that many of yours aren't.  King James is a shitty translation.  But as I don't know enough about their particular Bible beliefs, I can't speak any further past that.  You say that Christians need to wake up, but really all you're showing is that different brands of Christianity exist.  You've said that they're a bunch of pejorative terms without justifying any of those terms.  You've shown examples of things that seem to only showcase that all you're trying to preserve is bigotry.  And I'm gonna let you know right now, if the Christian faith wants to survive in the next few hundred years, that's probably something that needs to be dropped out of their belief system.  One does not need to hate the gay to be a Christian. ",

At the end of the day, what this seems to be is that things around you are changing, and that makes you incredibly uncomfortable.  People around you that you don't like are being accepted by society, and that's something that you're not a huge fan of.  You want to hide behind your Christianity in order to justify that level of bigotry.  But unfortunately for you and the rest of Christians like your ilk, people are starting to see through it.  They're starting to see that in some cases the homophobia comes first, and then the Christianity is used as a shield to hold on to it.
