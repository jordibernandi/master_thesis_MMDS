            "text": "First on your announcement about the WHO, I understand your grievances with them, but can you address why it is the correct time to do this now in the middle of the pandemic?  SECRETARY KERRY, Well, we're going to be dealing with countries and we're going to be dealing with leaders of different parts of the world.  We spend $500 million a year \u2013 we have for many years, far more than anybody else, including China.  I mean, look, I read off a long list of problems that we have, and we've had problems with them for years.  It doesn't matter.  We're looking at a term of 60 to 90 days.  We're doing a very thorough investigation right now as we speak.  But this should have been done by previous administrations a long time ago.  And when you look at the mistakes that were made, all of the mistakes that were made, it's just something we have to look at.  And it is very China-centric.  I told that to President Xi.  I said, the world Health Organization is very China-centric, meaning whatever it is, China was always right.  You can't do that.  You can't do that.  Not right.  And we spend it.  Again, it's not a question of money, but when we're spending $500 million and China's spending $38 million, $34 million, $40 million, $42 million in a case, it's, again, not money, but it's not right.  So we'll see.  This is an evaluation period.  But in the meantime, we're putting a hold on all funds going to World Health.  We will be able to take that money and channel it to the areas that most need it.  And that's another way of doing it.  But we have not been treated properly.  Mr.  President, you mentioned that you're going to be speaking with the all the governors.  Yes.  Make recommendations on probably Thursday, Thursday.  What if they don't listen to you or take your advice or obey you?  Will you consider taking away their federal funding?  I don't want to say that.  They'll listen.  They'll be fine.  I think we're going to have a good relationship.  They need the federal government not only for funding, and I'm not saying take it away, but they need it for advice.  They'll need maybe equipment that we have.  We have a tremendous stockpile that we're in the process of completing.  We're in a very good position.  Again, the cupboard was bare when I got here.  Nobody ever thought a thing, in all fairness, to previous administrations.  Nobody ever thought anything like this was going to happen.  But it did happen.  No, the governors will be very, very respectful of the presidency.  Again, this isn't me.  This is the presidency.  The presidency has such great importance in terms of what we're doing.  And you can talk about Constitution.  You can talk about federalism.  You can talk about whatever you want.  The best way I'm talking now from a managerial standpoint is to let individual governors run individual states and come to us if they have difficulty and we will help them.  Yeah, John.  You talked about having testing and tracing equipment and the facility for that in place to open up the government.  Dr.  Fauci said this morning that that critical testing and tracing ability does not currently exist.  Well, I don't know.  Look, I don't know.  I don't know what he said.  My question is, will it exist by May 1st?  The individual governors have testing.  The individual governors, we have many forms of testing, and new testing is being developed.  Our country has to get open.  And it will get open, and it'll get open safely and hopefully quickly.  Some areas quicker than other areas.  But there is tremendous testing, and the governors will use whatever testing is necessary.  And if they're not satisfied with their testing, they shouldn't open.  But they'll use whatever testing is necessary.  Go ahead, please.  Thank you, Mr.  President.  Back to the WHO.  Will you support the organization again if Tedros is immediately replaced?  Or do you want to see him step down as possible?  Well, we're doing an investigation.  I don't know the gentleman, but I know there have been problems.  And it's been very unfair to the United States, just like the World Trade Organization has been very, very unfair.  And now they're coming into line.  when they consider China a developing nation?  And because China is a developing nation, they take massive advantage of the United States?  Why didn't other presidents stop this?  I've been talking about it from the day I got in, and we're looking at that very, very strongly.  World trade, W. So I have a problem with world health and world trade, both of them.  I'm not sure which is worse, you want to know the truth.  But we'll figure it out, okay?  Go ahead, Chris.  The Press.  Thank you, Mr.  President.  You were just criticizing the WHO for, praising China as transparent, but you were saying many of the same things about China just a couple of months ago.  So, I mean, how do you square your decision to... Well, I did a trade deal with China, where China's supposed to be spending $250 billion in our country.  We're going to be watching very much to see.  Now, we've got a little bit waylaid by the virus.  But, look, I'd love to have a good relationship with China.  But if you look, and we made a phenomenal deal.  China has paid, because of me, China has paid us Tens of billions of dollars over the course of a very short period of time.  Billions of it.  Some of that money has been spent to farmers where they were targeted by China.  We cannot let that happen.  We can't let that happen.  So we ended up signing a very good trade deal.  Now I want to see if China lives up to it.  I know President Xi.  I think he will live up to it.  If he doesn't live up to it, that will be okay, too, because we have very, very good alternatives.  Go ahead.  Yeah, thank you.  Today, 600,000 cases, 25,000 deaths.  I know you want to blame the WHO, but I've spoken to hundreds of people across the country in the last few weeks who say they still can't get tested and that they aren't social distancing.  So the governors, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Excuse me, excuse me.  I know your question.  You ready?  The governors, the governors are supposed to do testing.  It's up to the governors.  Go ahead, please.  Quiet.  Quiet.  Quiet.  The question is, they say that they are following your lead, that they are not social distancing.  The governors are doing the testing.  It's now not up, and it hasn't been up to the federal government.  Go ahead.  The question is about social distancing, sir.  I told them when they put this guy here, it's nothing but trouble.  He's a showboat.  If you keep talking, I'll leave and you can have it out with the rest of these people.  If you keep talking, I'm going to leave and you can have it out with them.  Just a loud mouth.  Go ahead.  If you could kind of clarify, are you basically lifting your slow the spread before the May 1 deadline?  No, I'm not at all.  The governors are going to be running their individual states.  Some of them will say, no, I can't open now.  And some of them may... last longer than we even would think.  Others will say, I can.  You can go.  I don't want to mention states, but there are numerous states that are in great shape right now.  They're viewing the rest of the country like we don't even believe this is happening.  We have a lot of those states.  They're set to open practically now.  I mean, they would be open now.  We're going to let them open sooner than the date.  We're going to pick a date.  We're going to get a date.  that's good, but it's going to be very, very soon.  Sooner than the end of the month.  But there are many states out there that are looking at this and they're reviewing it and they're saying, we shouldn't be even included in this.  You know, there are some that want to open up almost now.  Now, if we disagree with it, we're not going to let them open.  We're not going to let them open.  If some governor said, you know, has a lot of problems, a lot of cases, a lot of death, and they want to open early, we're not going to let it happen.  So we're there to watch.  We're there to help.  But we're also there to be critics.  And on testing, very important, we've always wanted the states to do the testing.  We're now providing great testing, but the state has to provide the great testing.  The state has to provide the ventilators, but they didn't do that.  So we ended up going into the ventilator business, essentially, and we've made tens of thousands of ventilators, and we solved a big problem for the states.  But we want them to do the testing, and we are there to help.  Yeah, please.  I have two questions, or I have a question on the ground.  One question, just one.  One question.  Go ahead.  Can I follow up on Jordan's question?  Go ahead.  Do you want to walk back where you did praise China in January for being transparent about the coronavirus?  I'm always respectful of China.  I'm respectful of other countries.  Why wouldn't I be respectful of China?  In the meantime, China's paid us.  Nothing in your last administration, nothing in any previous administration.  They paid us tens of billions of dollars because of what we've done.  And the trade deal we have, they have to give us $250 billion in purchases.  Let's see if they do that.  And they're also paying us 25% of $250 billion in tariffs.  So we're taking in, wait a minute, we're taking in billions of dollars for China from China.  They never paid us 10 cents.  That's a great thing.  If they don't produce or if we find out bad things, we're not going to be happy.  But right now, and we're doing that.  That's what we're doing.  Look, we have an investigation underway.  We're paying almost $500 million.  We have an investigation underway on the World Health Organization.  We will find out exactly what went on.  And we may be satisfied that it could be remedied, and we may be satisfied that it's so bad that it can't be remedied.  And if it can't, we're going to go a different route.  I don't talk about China's transparency.  Well, you know, if I'm so good to China, how come I was the only person, the only leader of a country that closed our borders tightly against China?  And by the way, when I closed our border, that was long ahead of what anybody, you can ask anybody that was in the room, 21 people.  I was the one person that wanted to do it.  Deborah can tell you that better than anybody.  I was the one person that wanted to do it.  You know why?  Because I don't believe everything I hear.  And I close.  And if we didn't close our border early, very early, long before the kind of dates you're talking about, we would have had thousands and probably hundreds of thousands more deaths.  Please.  Please.  That's enough.  Thank you.  The Press.  Yes, that's being worked on very strongly.  When will we have that?  The President I would say within two weeks, and it's being worked on, Deborah.  We're working on that very strongly.  Okay, CDC is working, but we're getting reports on that.  Yeah, please, go ahead.  No, in the back.  Yeah.  The Press.  Mr.  President, you're talking about reopening parts of the country by the end of the month.  And if you do that, and as a result, you see a spike in cases in those areas.  We may not, but we may not.  You know, some countries haven't.  Some countries haven't.  I'm watching other countries.  I'm studying other countries as they open.  I mean, I don't want to go into names because for some it would be a little bit embarrassing.  But I'm studying other countries as we go along.  So on that, we have looked at every country that's opened, some successfully, some OK.  No total disaster, but some okay.  And some have to go back to the hot spot and fix the hot spot.  We think we're going to do it very successfully.  Again, we have one country, but we have lots of different pieces.  It's a puzzle.  We have beautiful pieces, beautiful states with capable governors.  They know when it's time to open.  And we don't want to put pressure on anybody.  I'm not going to put any pressure on any governor to open.  I'm not going to say to Governor Cuomo, you've got to open within seven days.  I want him to take his time, do it right, and then open New York.  I'm not putting any pressure on the governors.  Some of them don't need pressure or not pressure.  I mean, they're ready to go.  And that's a good thing.  So we'll open it up in beautiful little pieces as it comes along.  Please, go ahead, behind you.  Just a quick question.  You spoke about Governor Cuomo.  Just wondering if you have any thoughts on some of his remarks from earlier today where he basically said that were New York to be pressured to be open, it would cause a constitutional crisis.  And he basically said that you declared yourself King Trump.  So I'm wondering if you've heard those thoughts.  Yeah, I've declared myself as king.  You know, I heard he said that, but I didn't see the remarks.  But he understands how we helped him.  He needed help.  We gave him 2,900 hospital beds.  He didn't use them.  We gave him a ship.  He didn't use them.  And I'm not saying \u2014 but I'm saying that's good, because you know what?  That means he didn't need them.  But we said it was too much, but we wanted to err.  We said, err on the side of caution, as I said.  We said, look, We don't think you need it, but if you do, we're going to have them built.  And the Army Corps of Engineers did a fantastic job, and the U.S.  Navy did a fantastic job.  when we moved the ship that was not meant for COVID, and we had it redesigned for COVID, but they still didn't have very many people going in.  Now, we are \u2014 we'll get along just fine.  He understands.  We'll get along just fine.  Please.  Talk up, please, louder.  What's your assurance to workers who are asked to go back to work but are fearful of doing so?  Well, that's going to be up to the governors.  The governors are going to want to make sure everything's safe.  Now, I think that companies can do testing on a maybe weekly basis.  You don't have to do it every day with the same worker.  But they can do testing.  They can do temperature gauges.  They can do a lot of different things.  And, you know, we're only talking about for a period of time.  You know, eventually, we want to get back to where we were.  We want people actually sitting next to each other in ballgames eventually.  You know, we're not going to rip out every other seat in baseball stadiums and football stadiums.  We want to go back to where we were.  I want people to understand that.  We're not going to be like the way you are.  We have 300 reporters in the back that want to sit.  Look at this, the way this looks.  I don't even like the way it looks, although I have a lot fewer reporters.  That's okay with me.  But look at the way this looks.  I've never seen anything, John.  I've never seen anything quite like it.  But there are a lot of people.  We don't want this.  I don't want this.  I don't want this.  Eventually, we're going back where restaurants that had 150 seats are going to have 150 seats, not 50 seats, because they can't make it at 50 seats.  But more importantly, the atmosphere is even better.  We have to get used to it.  We have to get used to it.  I don't know that people are going to be shaking hands as readily.  Some will.  I said to some of the hospital people today, so will people be shaking hands again?  And I must say, I was a little surprised.  Most of them said probably.  Because there is some kind of a thing to it.  I was never a big handshaker, but when I ran for politics, I said, I think I better start shaking people's hands.  Go ahead, John.  The President.  Mr.  President, a couple of financial questions, if I could.  Larry Kudlow said this morning that at the current run rate, the paycheck protection money will run out very soon.  The plan to re-up it is stalled in Congress.  What can you do as President to try to move that forward?  Well, we're trying to get it done.  The problem is the Democrats want to put all sorts of things.  Last time they put Kennedy Center in.  I hated putting Kennedy Center in.  I have great respect for Kennedy Center.  But I hated putting it in the bill because it's just not appropriate, right?  But they wanted it in.  for whatever reason.  They had their own political reason.  And, John, I said, watch the way that blows up.  And it blew up.  I think it blew up in their face.  We want to take care of our workers.  We'll worry about other things and other pet projects of Democrats and also Republicans later.  But it's been a tremendously successful program.  I think you see it.  The banks have stepped up.  Hundreds of thousands of loan applications approved.  Money is going out.  It's been a tremendous program.  Really, it's been.  Obviously, it was at a point where we're almost, you know, we're almost.  the money will be expired and we could use a refill for the workers.  We want to be able to make sure that small businesses stay open, John.  And I think that'll happen.  Yeah, go ahead.  The Press Today, California's governor set out a list of six criteria for reopening the economy there.  Did he consult with you on that?  And also, you said earlier that there were as many as 20 states that could reopen their economies as early as May 1st.  Could you list some of those?  The President.  No, I didn't say all of them by May 1st, but there are 20 states.  Actually, I was given a number.  Twenty-nine states are in very, very good shape.  I don't want to say whether or not the governor spoke with me about that, but we've had a very good relationship.  Gavin Newsom, and very, very good relationship.  Yeah, in the back.  Go ahead, please.  The Press.  Thank you very much.  I have two questions.  One is for Mr.  President.  The President.  One question.  The Press But a person who can't be here, and so I \u2014 The President Who cares?  If he can't be here, that's too bad.  You know, right?  The Press All right.  one question that i have is about the uh from the united nations and economist uh maximo torero.  uh says that uh that there is.  there's a danger that there that the food supply could be interrupted during this pandemic and i want to know what you're going to do about.  well i think the farmers are incredible.  they're producing levels of food like uh just unbelievable.  Our transportation, that's one of the reasons I have the transportation people on the line tomorrow for the delivery of the food.  No, we're doing phenomenally with the food.  And I will say the stores, Kroger and Walmart, which has a lot of the food, and many of the stores, they seem to be in very good shape, but I haven't heard that at all.  We're going to be very strong on food supply.  Okay, how about one more question?  Go ahead, please.  Yes, the death projections that you mentioned earlier are based on full social distancing until the end.  Yeah.  So if you ease up on these guidelines now, how many more Americans do you think?  Well, I'm not easing up.  First of all, we'll have guidelines even for the states that open and there'll be.  guidelines.  But we will not have any problem with that.  Your question is a very interesting question.  But the states that are opening are not states which will have a problem with that.  Plus, they will have to adhere to guidelines until a certain point into the future when the enemy is vanquished.  The reason they don't have a problem now is because of social distancing.  No, the reason they don't have is partially and some of that will stay in effect.  Much of it will stay in effect for a period of time.  But the reason also is that different kinds of states, they have lots of room.  They have fewer people and they have lots of room.  And that's one of the primary reasons.  I want to thank you all very much.  So a lot of positive things are happening.  We're going to have some very strong recommendations for the governors.  We're going to work with the governors.  The governors are going to do a good job.  And if they don't do a good job, we're going to come down on them very hard.  We'll have no other choice.  Thank you all very much.  Thank you.  Thank you.
