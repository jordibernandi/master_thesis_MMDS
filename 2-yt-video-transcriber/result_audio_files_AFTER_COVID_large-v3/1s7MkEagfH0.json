            "text": "The mob that stormed the Capitol on January 6th to try to stop Congress from carrying out its constitutional responsibilities were behaving like domestic enemies of our country.  But let's be clear, the John Brennans, Adam Schiff's and the oligarchs in big tech who are trying to undermine our constitutionally protected rights and turn our country into a police state with KGB style surveillance are also domestic enemies and much more powerful and therefore dangerous than the mob that stormed the Capitol.  President Biden, I call upon you and all members of Congress from both parties to denounce these efforts by the likes of Brennan and others to take away our civil liberties that are endowed to us by our Creator and guaranteed in our Constitution.  If you don't stand up to these people now, then our country will be in great peril. ",

            "text": "Very valid points made by Tulsi Gabbard and as someone ... whose family went through KGB surveillance and oppression.  Can we please make sure it doesn't happen here in the ... United States welcome back beautiful and amazing human ... beings.  this is Ukradowski of wearechange.org.  a lot of important ... issues to get in today as Davos 2020 has just ... officially started and oh boy.  Is there a full frontal push for of course the great reset ... which we are going to be talking about in great detail ... on this independent media channel as well as all the ... latest news.  an independent media organization that ... wants to remind you just like politicians scientists or ... corruptible as well and many times the professionals have ... lied to you for the benefit of special interest.  why am I ... saying that specifically at this time.  No reason at all just an interesting tidbit that I ... think you should know about.  absolutely no reason at all as ... of course very large and powerful secretive ... institutions remain unaccountable in the United ... States now jumping in the news.  that looks like President ... Joe Biden is definitely on an executive order signing spree.  as he has already signed over 30 executive orders as we speak ... right now the number is quickly rising.  also an ... interesting thing to note in American politics is that US ... Senator Ted Cruz just introduced an amendment that ... would impose term limits to members of the House of ... Congress.  and even though I don't agree with Ted Cruz on a ... lot of things I think this is an absolutely smart ... brilliant idea that needs to be implemented to actually ... drain some of that nasty corroded disgusting waste ... Washington DC in other parts of the world that they are ... almost as chaotic as in the United States.  this as even ... local politicians in Holland or warning that the country is ... headed towards a civil war following many massive protest ... against of course of the lockdowns that have been ... implemented in that country.  for the first time since ... World War 2 the Netherlands has actually set up a curfew ... as they are warning about days or even weeks of unrest as ... protesters have taken to the streets and even burned down ... testing facilities in of course their anger at the ... state for shutting down all normal life.  now the Dutch ... Prime Minister even came out and warned the writers that ... they will be quote treated like criminals and insisted.  that quote.  ninety nine per cent of the country is allegedly supporting the curfews a statement of course not backed by any evidence since it looks like a large majority of the country is out in the middle of the streets rioting against the government.  very interestingly i'm not seeing any coverage of this in the american mainstream media but we have to acknowledge what we're ... seeing in Holland is absolutely significant and ... soon may be coming to many places around the world ... especially in places that lock down their citizens the most.  bureaucrats thinking they know what's best for the people ... news.  we of course have new news surrounding the quote ... great reset a very generalized term.  but before ... we get into all of that we have to pay the bills here to ... keep this operation up and running and that's why I would ... like to tell you about one company that I am personally ... working with.  I just set up an affiliate account with them ... because I use their services.  I liked it.  I'm recommending ... It is VPN City.  the link to it is down below and if you're ... looking for an extra layer of privacy and security and ... content that your government could be banning from you or ... corporations or even entertainment content.  check ... out VPN City.  it's an excellent way to spoof your location and ... to travel all over the world through the internet.  so yeah ... they have plans as low as $2.99 per month.  they have a 30 day back money guarantee ... check them out.  I like them I use them and I think you will too.  Now the World Economic Forum did something very ... interesting.  they're pretty much a conglomerate of ... bankers billionaires corporate heads and a lot of the other ... quote influencers in mainstream media ... entertainment Society and they just released the latest ... propaganda video about their idea of the crate reset.  now ... what's interesting is not the talking points it's not the ... vague language it's not the generalizations of how they ... help you it's the fact that they actually left to the ... comment section and the like to dislike ratio public so ... people could actually get a transparent accountable look ... to their ideas being contested by everyone out ... there and surprisingly.  boom people hate the idea of centralization and more ... government while giving up their personal freedoms to ... individuals who created a problem that they're now ... claiming to solve G. who would have thought?  and when you look ... at the absolute ratio here and the comments I mean ... goodness gracious they are overwhelmingly doubtful and ... distrustful of this proposed great reset agenda and this ... latest video that was just released.  the first comment by ... the way that has the most likes so far says quote the ... only thing that needs a reset are these traitors of ... humanity.  that's of course a public comment by Matt Ren ... here on this platform.  the second is by a user named KV ... who says quote people disenfranchised by a broken system.  that these people put into place to begin with the ... hubris of these people will result in great atrocities ... guaranteed the next comment.  so basically give the leaders ... who brought us to this mess need more power so they can be ... the solution.  no thank you.  the next one.  Yeah pretty much that's called communism.  pick up a history ... book folks another one.  you could take this communism ... and not so kindly shove it where the sun doesn't shine.  I ... mean I could just keep reading these comments all ... day.  they are very entertaining and if you want a good laugh ... People do bring up some interesting points because ... when you look at the idea of the Great Reset the World ... Economic Forum even described it themselves as ... people owning nothing having no privacy.  and quote ... living a life better than ever.  and if you look at the ... individuals promoting these ideas individuals like ... Bill Gates one of the world's richest people in ... history who by the way also just became the number one ... owner of farmland in the United States.  when you have ... those individuals lecturing you about how you don't need ... nothing.  I'm sorry but.  You're not convincing me there at all.  Now Naomi Klein describes the great reset and I think of a very fair way in which she says quote in short the great recess encompasses some good stuff that won't happen and some bad stuff that certainly will and frankly nothing out of the ordinary in our era of green billionaires.  Rockets for Mars.  and she's right.  when you look at the ... term great reset again it's extremely generalized.  it's ... sort of like a Northern Star for billionaires and ... globalist and technocrats who want to see an opportunity in ... every crisis that they could exploit for their own ... personal benefit.  and it's not really a concrete plan or ... manual set up there.  it's it's literally essentially a set of ... ideas pushing for more globalization.  and and Davos ... and the World Economic Forum have been pushing for these ... a long time.  in 2009 their big idea was quote shaping the ... post-crisis world.  in 2010 it was rethink redesign rebuild.  in ... 2012 they said the great transformation.  and in 2018 ... they set out a plan to quote creating a shared future in a fractured world.  And I think Naomi Klein made a very fair point when she said ... if Davos wasn't seeking a better form of capitalism to ... solve the spiraling crisis.  Davos itself systematically ... deepened.  it wouldn't be Davos.  and she absolutely makes a ... very fair point that people should hear especially during ... the 2021 Davos meeting which is being held right now ... virtually and the theme of it is quote a crucial year to ... holy crap these people are believing us we're getting ... ratioed and totally obliterated in the comment ... section because people are finding out we created the ... problems that now we're trying to give them the ... solution for.  but but I guess maybe they didn't have enough ... space on the cover board to write all that.  I don't know ... but to me that that's more fair of a theme.  there then ... rebuilding trust about the ideas of the great reset and ... now the event is being held right now in 430 cities ... across the world were just very vague language used by ... extremely powerful individuals pushing an agenda ... to gain them more power and that's that's let's be honest ... here that that's essentially what it was.  these people are ... some of the most powerful people in the world because ... they got there through similar means and ways.  now for me ... personally this is something that that should be taken ... there is a threat of these people getting their way and essentially pushing a society that is exemplified by modern-day communist china.  as of course we are seeing china become more and more influential at the davos conference as even the wall street journal released an opinion piece that is titled Xi Jinping the president of China wows them at Davos with ... their byline.  Chinese president sweet talks ... liberal leaders as he threatens Taiwan.  but let's ... let's be honest here many of these liberal leaders many ... of these globalists are envious at the total ... technocratic authoritarian state that the Chinese ... government was able to achieve in their country.  ... keeping their citizens under control with a social credit ... score organ harvesting.  and you know genocide.  you can ... You would think if Davos or the World Economic Forum wanted a better world, they would deal with the genocide of one of their speakers, you know, the Uyghur Muslim population.  But no, we're all going to work together to create a better world as China is becoming more and more influential in shaping it.  Specifically, what China is calling for here and during this World Economic Forum Davos meeting is a greater role for economic development.  governance aka the government more involved in the economy ... which historically is absolutely disastrous.  central ... controlling and central planning by governments has ... led to tremendous economic suffering and instability ... and calling for more of it is absolutely naive from a ... historical perspective and the Chinese president was ... very clear that he not only wants central control of ... of the Chinese economy but also the global economy as he ... called for global economic government.  now this is of ... course efforts put together by China that are building the ... Belt and Road initiative that are becoming more and more ... engaged internationally as of course they're looking for ... global hegemony and global supremacy in the world.  now ... what would the world look like with China as the world ... well a very frightful one where of course any dissent any ... critiques would be utterly wiped out.  of course this is ... not the first time that the Chinese president has ... outlined his plans for global economic governance or just ... global governance in itself and we have to understand ... China is as powerful as they are.  mainly because of the support of many billionaires and ... multinational corporations that have established it to be ... as powerful as it is right now whether it's Nike Apple you ... name it.  many of the companies that you buy from that you depend on.  are literally financing and bankrolling the Chinese ... state and depending on slaves to produce a lot of ... those goods.  so to have a lot of these heads of these ... multinational corporations these billionaires along ... with the politicians that they own fawn over the Chinese ... government and their plans makes absolutely more sense ... as they're even new articles talking about how China is ... going to take more responsibility in global government.  Now if we're talking about a global government led by China ... oh boy does this signal some troubling times ahead and of ... course a lot of this is being done all in the name of ... globalization multilateralism and they're ... going to be doing it in a way where it hasn't been done ... As the China Daily even points out globalization has arrived ... at a historical tipping point and I think that is certainly ... true with the latest technological advancements ... which of course the World Economic Forum also sees as a ... perfect opportunity for quote.  globalization 4.0 or as they are calling it the fourth industrial revolution ... the redefining of capitalism AKA more central planning ... more direct government involvement in the free ... market eliminating it.  so you have less choices less ... control less power over yourself which the great ... globalist multinational corporations billionaires ... along with their buddies from China who commit genocide ... tell you is good for you.  it's going to be great.  not to have any privacy and not to own anything because ... life will be never better under the control of ... genocidal megalomaniacs.  this agenda is mainly going to ... work if people believe in it.  if the mainstream media ... convinces you that giving up your power might be ... something good for you again.  just another ridiculous idea that is.  there's going to be a lot of opportunists trying to take ... advantage of this situation trying to push for this.  we've ... seen politicians in India call for this and politicians in ... Brazil saying no way specifically saying no to the ... Great Reset which they say quote totalitarian social ... control is not the remedy for any crisis.  those are the ... comments by Brazil's Minister of Foreign Affairs and I ... think this might be one of the few times that a politician.  actually makes sense.  what do you think?  does this make ... sense to you?  if so share this video with your friends and ... family members strangers people walking down the ... street.  I don't care.  if you bump into someone in the ... supermarket you're like hey.  Here let me double click here and send you this link ... because you need to watch this more than ever since ... of course there are major efforts and algorithms and ... incentives to make sure our voices aren't heard ... meanwhile promoting of course CNN that will sell out ... and do anything for a buck.  you don't even want to know ... what they'll do for two bucks or some nasty nasty ... disgust but of course they get preferential treatment ... there there in the searches there in the recommended ... there in the playing next video.  We're not we're never going to be because again we're ... not CNN and we rely predominantly on your support ... to help get this video out there to the general public.  if ... it wasn't for you I would not be here and this is why I love ... you guys stay tuned for more here on.  we are change.
