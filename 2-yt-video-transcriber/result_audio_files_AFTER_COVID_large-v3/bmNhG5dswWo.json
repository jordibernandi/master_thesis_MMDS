            "text": "So I only have a couple of minutes left.  So let me tell you, first of all, this is my home I'm shooting in.  That was a backdrop in the first part.  I could have danced better, but I have a balance issue because I'm still recovering.  And the most important message is what Dr.  Gant has told you and what I have told you all along, which is that human beings, although we're very ordinary and I'm just a human being like everyone else, We have immortal souls and we're in a new reality.  And the way that I know that we're going to be victorious and we're going to get rid of this corruption is because of what I did.  And the reason I'm allowed to speak for everyone else, it's because I was in the World Bank legal department and many, many years ago, exactly a hundred years, no, fifty years ago.  The World Bank was created in 1944 and I wrote a paper when I was in law school in 1976 about how important it was that the World Bank was representing all of the people of the world and that the World Bank is a co-op.  And I was explaining what Ferdinand Marcos was doing.  I wrote a paper between my third and fourth year at Yale Law School.  And actually, in retrospect, I was hired into the World Bank just for this very important job, which is to preserve the world's wealth, because that's what the World Bank was created to do.  And Ferdinand Marcus is the lawyer and the one who who deposited the wealth of the world in the World Bank was Jose Rizal.  Jose Rizal, he was from the Philippines.  The world's wealth was buried in the Philippines between the second, sorry, at the end of World War II.  And you can see that I'm being attacked because every single moment that I'm with you, the world's, what are they, the black nobility, they're trying to prevent me from getting through to you.  And I'm able to talk to you.  I was able to turn my cell phone on with the music.  So you see, although there's a lot of interference, I'm still able to function.  And that's the case of everybody in the world.  They're all being attacked.  And some of us are able to function even though we're being attacked because we can't be hypnotized.  And those people who are able to function, we're working for everybody else because you're hypnotized, you've been duped.  But as time goes by, we're going to become more and more credible.  And as I started out by saying, the military powers of the world.  They're along with us.  They're part of the critical mass.  And so I'm going to sign off for now.  And I'm going to do another video, which I'm going to publish.  I'll publish it today, but I'm going to put it on DC TV in the next couple of weeks. ",
