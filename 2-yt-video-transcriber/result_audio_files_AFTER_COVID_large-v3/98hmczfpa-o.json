            "text": "When I was little, my father was famous.  He was the greatest samurai in the empire.  Hey everybody, remember last week I had a couple videos about the globe denier that said light doesn't reflect off a sphere and then claimed that light can't reflect 180 degrees off a sphere.  so the moon isn't reflecting sunlight?  Remember that?  Yeah.  Well, one thing I brought up is how these science deniers always make these claims and challenges saying, if you do X, you'll see that it doesn't work.  And then they're 100% wrong about the result because they never bothered to try it themselves.  Today's example is William here.  Apparently, William posted a comment on my first moon reflection video that I didn't see, so when I put out the second video, he was a bit taken aback by the fact that I didn't address his issue in my response.  And he points out that the moon isn't a polished ball bearing, even though in the video he was commenting on, my moon was a dirty ball of clay.  While William here agrees that light obviously can reflect off a sphere, he believes what Show Me the Evidence was really trying to say was that light doesn't reflect off a round object that is covered in a thick layer of dust, soil, and rock.  Is William making any more sense than Show Me the Evidence?  No.  Because it's been established that if you can see an object, that means the light has reflected towards you.  So since a dusty, soily rock is visible, we must conclude that it reflects light, right?  But then he takes it a step further.  challenging.  Point a powerful light at a bunch of sand, rocks, or dirt, and the dirt will not illuminate anything near it.  Only something fairly polished or lightly colored will reflect enough for illumination.  Does he really believe that?  Has he ever tried it?  Because it's a really simple test to do.  Just Go out at night with no moon in the sky.  Set your camera manually so it doesn't try to compensate in the dark.  Shine a high-powered flashlight at the dirt and see if dirt reflects enough light to illuminate something.  Well, there you go.  Apparently, dark soil does reflect enough light to illuminate another object.  And this is a dinky flashlight and really dark soil, which a quick lookup says has an albedo of about 8% to 10%.  Now, the moon, as globe deniers will quickly tell you, has an albedo of about 12%, more reflective than this dark soil.  Now, given that the sun is so bright that if you were able to stare at it unfiltered, you would permanently damage your eyes, do you think that 12% of that would be bright enough to illuminate other objects?  Of course you do.  After all, this flashlight bounced off the soil enough and... Oh, by the way, I recorded this narration part before going out at night and doing the demo.  Why did I feel comfortable enough doing that?  Because unlike globe deniers like William, I've used a flashlight in the dark before.  I mean, what is it about people that makes them speak with confidence about things they obviously never tested before?  And this isn't the type of challenge that's a big ask, like go to the South Pole and record 24 hours of sunlight.  No, it's shine a flashlight at dirt.  And for some reason, They've never done it.  But make claims about it with confidence.  It's freaking pathetic.  That's my job.  That's what I do.  If I don't lose, I win.  I win.  Is there no one on this planet to even challenge me?  Maybe you came by to congratulate me on last night's victory. ",
