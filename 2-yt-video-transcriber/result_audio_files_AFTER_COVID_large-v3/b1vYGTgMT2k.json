            "text": "The late great man-woman myth famously coined the phrase, women are human beings and men are human doings.  And in as much as it's an observation about the state of society and the state of men in society, it's pretty much as axiomatic as you can get.  We see this reflected all the time, on a constant basis.  Men are as valuable as their contributions are, and as visible as their contributions are.  and when they cease to make useful contributions as deemed useful by society at large and more specifically by women they once again skulk into the obscurity of invisibility and that is again as axiomatic as it can come.  women on the other hand are famously as in the quote human beings their accord to humanity their needs are listened to their desires are taken into account And on the surface, this seems like a very, very poor circumstance indeed to be in, in case you're a man.  There are many, many social issues affecting men in disproportionate numbers, sometimes vastly disproportionate numbers as compared to women.  And the ignorance and lack of attention paid to these things, they're all consequences of this social axiom.  But today I wanted to take the time to not just focus on that.  We all know the negative sides of being the invisible man, of being somebody who just does.  But one benefit is that inevitably, inexorably, it brings you to a state of reflection.  Think about all of us, everyone, myself included.  All the things that we have been conditioned to believe, all the things we were told we should believe about ourselves, about women, about society, about the world at large, we absorbed these lessons, assuming they were true, and yet they were in constant conflict with observable reality as we knew it.  And we were told, just do, don't think.  Keep your nose to the grindstone.  Keep on moving forward.  Get back into line.  That's what we heard all the time.  Still hear this.  And as a consequence of that, it was only a matter of time until some of us, many of us woke up.  We woke up from this very, very odd dream, a dream that had been placed in our heads to reality that we now understand to be as real as it gets.  And the benefit to being a thing, the benefit to being disregarded in the world, the benefit to being somebody who nobody gives a shit about on a macro scale unless you're doing something important, is that really, really gives you the opportunity to think about things because they could never have constructed a lie big enough to fool men at large.  It's just so obvious when you live your life, when you get older, that you notice these things and you pick up on these things.  And this huge benefit I'm talking about is the power of self-reflection.  By telling us just to do and not think, they inevitably forced us to think.  They inevitably forced us to really, really take in reality in a way that they had never dreamt of.  And conversely, by offering a tale of incontrovertible progress to women, of social advancements, of all the opportunities they now have and still need to get, right, because it's never enough, it's had the opposite effect.  You see, I've been around the block for a while now, as many of you know, and I've noticed a number of things.  One of the most prominent being, inasmuch as there are many, many portals open, it's almost exclusively, with a few exceptions, men who are waking up.  Almost every day I'll encounter some guy in the far-flung corners of the Internet saying, That will reveal to me, without any affiliation with the Manosphere, mind you, that he's suspicious of marriage, or that he thinks the institutions are unfair, or there's just something rigged about the whole game.  They know what's up.  The portals have been open.  Sure, you'll get a few who don't.  And as I stated in a recent video, there's some guys that the best case scenario is literally to become the cuckolded husband in their case.  But they are a minority ultimately.  And women, looking at the opposite end of things, I never encounter any of them who are aware of the level of social dysfunction that exists in the sexual market these days.  They're completely oblivious to the sexual dynamics, and they always come back with the same thing, the same retort.  It's either some sort of new alt, when you're talking about generalized theories about female behavior and male behavior, or it's some derivative of that.  So for example, you're making the wrong choices and you need to go for girls who are X or Y. And mind you, I'm out of the game.  I'm just an observer.  I observe the mating market from afar.  I talk to people who participate, but I'm not a participant myself.  It's always the same thing coming from women.  They simply don't get it.  And this, I think, is in part a consequence, not exclusively, but in part a consequence of the fact that they were, quote-unquote, liberated.  And men were told to keep to their business as usual and just do and not to think.  That brought about, in many ways, a revolution of thought at the level of individuals and at the macro scale to some degree.  The manosphere in some way, shape, or form is that revolution of thought, however imperfect it might be.  There's nothing on the opposite end of the coin with regards to women or feminism.  Everyone I encounter, without fail, as if they were almost all clones of each other, just repeats the same thing.  Some version of Noir, some version of men looking in the wrong places, or one I heard more recently, that the institution of marriage is so sacred that no value should be assigned to it.  It shouldn't even be put under the microscope of analysis.  It should just be accepted blatantly for what it is, hallowed, refined, impenetrable.  It's always some variant of this.  And all this reaction, it's pure emotion.  And I think there's some real consequences to this gentleman.  I really do.  Because think about it.  We know what the consequences are for men, and specifically young men these days.  Devastating in many ways.  There's not many opportunities anywhere in the world.  But the women don't pick up on it for a number of reasons.  For one, the gravy train of youth and looks, which they will ride as long as possible.  but also because of all the things they hear.  There's no self-reflection whatsoever.  You see, when you're an underdog, something about that state makes you acutely aware of that status as an underdog.  When you're told to simply do unthinkingly and just act and follow a protocol and don't question, inevitably that leads you to question, to not follow the protocol.  And women have been accorded as much freedom as possible.  more so than they ever have been in history.  and yet they're more enslaved to their instincts and desires than you could possibly imagine right now.  many of them don't have an inkling of awareness of what's happening.  they simply don't understand themselves or the world at large.  And I sometimes wonder if there ever can be or could be a red pill awakening for women at large.  I don't know.  I have my doubts.  But I can tell you one thing.  As much as there are many outliers, as much as there are problems within the I think ultimately it's been very beneficial.  And I also think it was inevitability.  You cannot exclude half of humanity and relegate them to a state of obscurity by simply telling them to follow orders and expect no disobedience, expect no rebellion, expect no thought, no reflection whatsoever.  It simply doesn't work that way.  And going forward, it's going to be very interesting, especially with the emergence of these technologies such as melody and similar things.  Are women going to have the same degree of self-reflection that men had to have?  It was essentially foisted upon men.  They had to reflect about these things.  And I'm leaning towards no.  Although maybe they will.  Maybe when the competition is great enough, they'll realize these things, but it remains to be seen.  And so the moral of the story here is as bad as it is to be a human doing, the human doing forces you to become human thinking.  When you're virtually unconditionally accepted as a human being, you're much less likely to reflect upon your situation.  Self-reflection is of benefit to both men and women.  I just don't see a whole lot of it on the female side these days.  Anyway, gentlemen, thanks for tuning in.  And if I'm still alive, I'll check you out later.  As always, may the gods watch over you.  Bye-bye.  If you liked this video, please like, share, and subscribe.  And if you enjoy my content, please consider making a donation or becoming a patron.
