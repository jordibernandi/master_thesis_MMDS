            "text": "We always knew Donald Trump would contest the election results.  President Donald Trump launching an assault on the integrity of the election.  He's spreading wilder and wilder conspiracy theories about nonexistent voter fraud.  Of course, these claims haven't held up in court because there's zero evidence.  But the integrity of thousands of people responsible for maintaining American democracy is being tested as never before.  Tragically, most Senate and House Republicans are failing the test by refusing to stand up to Trump.  Their cowardice is a devastating betrayal of public trust and will have lasting consequences.  They worry that speaking out could invite a primary challenge.  But democracy depends on moral courage.  These Republicans are profiles in cowardice.  Fortunately for our democracy, many lower-level Republican officeholders are passing the test.  Take, for example, Brad Raffensperger, Georgia's Republican Secretary of State, who oversaw the election there and describes himself as a Republican through and through, never voted for a Democrat.  Raffensperger is defending George's vote for Biden, rejecting Trump's accusations of fraud.  He spurned overtures from Senator Lindsey Graham, who asked Raffensperger if he could toss out all mail-in votes from counties with so-called high rates of questionable signatures.  And Raffensperger dismissed demands from George's two incumbent Republican senators, Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue.  both of them facing tougher-than-anticipated runoffs, that he resign.  This office runs on integrity, Raffensperger says, and that's what voters want to know, that this person is going to do his job.  Raffensperger has also received death threats from Republican voters inflamed by Trump's allegations.  Election officials in Nevada, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Arizona are also reporting threats.  If you pull some crap and unregister me to vote, I will hunt you down.  You have no right!  No right!  But they're not giving in to them.  While we're at it, let's not forget other public officials in the Trump administration who have stood up for democracy and against Trump.  Public health officials unwilling to lie about COVID-19.  Military leaders unwilling to back Trump's attacks on Black Lives Matter protesters.  Inspectors General unwilling to cover up Trump corruption.  U.S.  Foreign Service officers unwilling to lie about Trump's overtures to Ukraine.  Intelligence officials unwilling to bend their reports to sue Trump.  And Justice Department attorneys refusing to participate in Trump's obstructions of justice.  Some of them lost their jobs.  Some quit.  Many were demoted.  A few have been threatened with violence.  That's the price they had to pay to do what's morally right under Trump, who has no idea what it means to do what's morally right.  The question after January 20th, when Trump is gone from the White House, is how many Senate and House Republicans will do what's morally right?  How many of them will find the integrity to stand up for America rather than bend to the conspiracy theories and hatefulness that will be the legacies of Trumpism. ",
