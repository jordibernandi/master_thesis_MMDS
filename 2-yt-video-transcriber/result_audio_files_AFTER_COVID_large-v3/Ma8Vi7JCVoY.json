            "text": "If you have too many messages, you have no messages.  That ad from the Trump campaign was in one word, bad.  And let me explain why.  I'm Dan Pfeiffer, co-host of Pod Save America, and I was Barack Obama's communications director and senior advisor.  I worked on a number of campaigns for many, many years.  I have seen many ads, most of them bad, and even some good ones.  And we're going to get here together today to talk about the ads being run in the 2020 election, what the strategy is, what are the good ones, what are the bad ones, and what voters are supposed to take away from what Donald Trump, Joe Biden, and everyone else is paying to put on their television and in their social feeds.  Campaigns have two ways of communicating with voters, earned communications and paid communications.  Earned communications is the press coverage, like the interviews and the speeches and the rallies and their social posts, like everything they put on Instagram and Twitter, things that are free.  And earned communications are limited only by time and creativity.  Paid communications are the things that, lo and behold, campaigns pay to show voters.  And so those are television ads, digital ads, promoted tweets, the direct mail pieces that would arrive in your mailbox if you could go check your mail.  And the reason why paid communications are important is because in every campaign, even Republican ones, Money is at a premium.  And so if you decide to put money behind something, it means the campaign believes that it is a very important message they want to see voters.  So when you look at ads in particular, it gives you a window into how the candidate in the campaign see the race, what they see as the strengths of their candidate, the weaknesses of their opponent, and how they plan to win.  Over the last several days, the issue of coronavirus in China has come to dominate the campaign airwaves.  So we're going to look at a bunch of ads from Trump and his allies and Biden and his allies about China and the coronavirus.  Let's start with an ad from the Trump campaign itself. ",

            "text": "That ad from the Trump campaign wasn't one word.  Bad.  And let me explain why.  In an ad that is 60 seconds long like that ad, you really only have time to give one message.  And this ad gives a gazillion messages.  It is Biden is incompetent.  Biden is soft on China.  Biden is corrupt.  Trump is smart.  Trump is tough on China.  Anthony Fauci is smart.  If you have too many messages, you have no messages.  So this ad does not communicate one thing clearly.  And it's trying to do too much.  Second, the ad takes Washington governor and former Obama comment secretary Gary Locke and portrays him as a Chinese official, which he is most certainly not.  It is very on brand with the xenophobia that pulses through all of Trump's ads and tweets and communications.  And it's easy to assume that they are just idiots because that's EDC is often the answer to why they do certain things.  But it's very clear that Trump and his campaigns see the xenophobic parts of their ads as a feature, not a bug, because they know that Democrats will get outraged about it, as they should be.  And it helps the ad go viral on social media, which gets it more free views that they don't have to pay for.  It is very unusual for a president to go on the attack in the middle of a national crisis.  But the reason Trump is doing it is because he has seen a very steady and significant erosion in his support over the last several weeks.  A month ago in the Navigator daily tracking poll, the coronavirus, Donald Trump's approval ratings for handling the coronavirus were 52 approved, 42 disapproved.  As of this week, they fall into 44 approved, 52 disapproved.  So he's eight points underwater on his hand under the coronavirus.  And that trajectory has been even steeper over the last week.  So what has become clear is he is on the defensive and he's looking for someone to blame.  And so he has picked China.  There's a reason he picked China other than just his natural reflexive xenophobia is that polling shows that the American people overwhelmingly hold China responsible for how the coronavirus has been handled.  There's a Harris poll, which is a nonpartisan polling firm, which found north of 70% of voters thought China had lied about the coronavirus.  And a majority of voters in that poll believe that China should compensate the United States for some of the costs that we've suffered from the coronavirus.  So China is a very easy scapegoat for Trump, and he's trying to shift blame from himself.  to someone else.  But I think ultimately the problem with this ad is it was not designed with persuadable voters in mind.  If Donald Trump was to win this election, he's going to have to persuade some number of people who voted for him in 2016, but currently disapprove of him.  And he's going to have to persuade some people who voted for Mitt Romney in 2012, but Hillary Clinton in 2016.  So there's a bunch of people who there's not a ton of voters, but there are certainly a number of voters, particularly in the Midwestern battleground states like Michigan and Wisconsin, that are up for grabs.  And they are people who Donald Trump currently does not have in his column.  It's why he's losing in national polls by seven points this week.  But he's going to have to get them.  And this ad does not seem designed to do that.  Now let's look at some ads from Joe Biden and his allies.  First, an ad from the Biden campaign. ",

            "text": "Okay, a couple things about that ad in the Biden campaign.  It's running exclusively on digital.  Two, it's a very long ad.  A television ad is almost never more than 60 seconds long, and a digital ad is usually about 15 to 30 seconds.  So it's much longer than your average ad.  But what it's trying to accomplish are the following things.  One, respond to the attacks from Trump.  It has the very\u2014 Typical political response tactic where it says, my opponent is making these attacks get the truth.  And it provides voters with facts to push back on the idea that Joe Biden is soft on China.  Second, Trump has touted his response to the coronavirus by talking about the ban that Trump put in place for travelers from China.  So he's trying to undermine Trump's best argument.  And the broader strategic thing that Biden is trying to do with this ad, I believe, is to undermine Donald Trump's America first message.  America first.  America first.  We have seen in polling that Donald Trump's positioning as someone who puts America first is incredibly powerful with a lot of those same quote unquote, persuadable voters in the Midwest that I was talking about.  And Biden is trying to use Trump's failed response to the coronavirus, the fact that he repeatedly took China's word over the opinions of scientists in his own government as a way to turn that strength into a weakness.  Some have characterized Biden's ad as xenophobic and potentially stirring up hate against Chinese Americans.  And this is something as the China debate continues that Biden and other Democratic campaigns are going to have to watch because it'll be morally wrong and a losing political proposition if we get into a race to the bottom with Trump on anti-China rhetoric.  And the last ad we're going to look at today is from American Bridge, which is a Democratic super PAC. ",

            "text": "Here's why I think it's a good ad.  Because we have seen in a lot of the polling that Crooked Media has done with change research and data for progress over the last couple of years, what we have found is the most effective ads are the ones that give people very specific information they did not otherwise know.  We live in this very polarized country.  People have made broad assessments of the candidates.  But in the Trumpian 24-7 hyperactive media environment, a lot of very specific information does not break through.  This ad is telling people not that Trump is quote unquote bad on China or soft on China.  It's telling them that Trump did this very specific thing.  which is in the midst of the coronavirus, because he was not taking it seriously, he helped send millions of masks and other forms of equipment to China, the very masks and equipment that we currently do not have in this country, in a world in which our doctors and nurses are wearing garbage bags and reusing disposable masks.  Trump sent that equipment to China.  We actually tested this attack in the poll that we did with Data for Progress that John and I discussed on a recent episode of Pod Save America with Charlotte Swayze.  The specific question we asked was, the Trump administration sent 2 million masks and other medical equipment to China in February, and now American doctors and nurses don't have enough equipment to care for the skyrocketing number of coronavirus patients.  In that poll, 69% of voters found that information either very or somewhat concerning.  In our polarized political environment, the idea that you would find something that 69% of voters would be concerned about is a devastating political attack.  American Bridge has found a real political vulnerability here because it undermines Trump on China and provides people with a very specific piece of information that makes them question their understanding of Trump's response to coronavirus.  Thank you for joining our first episode where we break down the political ads of the 2020 cycle.  If you see other ads or political media out there you'd like us to look at, please let us know.  Thanks again, and we'll see you guys soon. ",
