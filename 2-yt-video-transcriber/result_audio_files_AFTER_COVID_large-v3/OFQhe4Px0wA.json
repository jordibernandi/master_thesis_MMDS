            "text": "This is the United States of America.  The USA is a settler colonial state.  What this means, in short, is that it was founded by people who moved from elsewhere to live on land that they'd stolen from the indigenous inhabitants who already live there.  In the case of the USA, many of these white European settlers came to form a social, economic, and political elite.  In the process of this, they enslaved many people, predominantly Africans.  They justified this slavery and the theft of native land with the idea that they were superior.  Today, the US population is made up of people from many different backgrounds.  That someone is American does not automatically imply that they are a part of any particular racial or ethnic group or that they have much in common with one another in terms of economic or political interests.  For example, they might be a black descendant of slaves.  They might be native and descended from people who were mass murdered for their land.  On average, those people still endure many disadvantages from the atrocities that were committed against their ancestors.  they might be white and literally be descended from the people who owned said slaves and stole said land.  On average, these people inherited many advantages from their ancestors and today they're still dominant socially, economically, and politically.  Many of them also still believe themselves to be superior.  There's of course other groups into which Americans are commonly. ",
