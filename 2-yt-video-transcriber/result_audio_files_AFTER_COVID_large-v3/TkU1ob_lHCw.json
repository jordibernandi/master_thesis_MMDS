Vote him away!  in the white house the mighty white house.  the liar tweets tonight.  in the west wing the self-obsessed wing.  the liar tweets tonight.  Push you doctors, push reporters, push you science nerds.  Look, my ratings are through the roof when I just say happy words.  Push you doctors.  Thank you.  Everyone can get a test.  It's just the flu.  It's a hoax like all the rest.  A left-wing coup.  We've got lots of PPE.  The cupboard's bare.  It's Obama's fault, you see.  The buck stops there.
