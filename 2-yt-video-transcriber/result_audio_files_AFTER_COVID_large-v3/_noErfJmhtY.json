We're having a conversation that is... Okay.  Okay, so the camera... Well, magically, right when the cameras show up, the suspect leaves.  Isn't that weird?  Isn't that weird timing?  Isn't that... Well, they just moved them down.  No, they didn't.  Hold on a minute.  So this was the call for the guy that they were calling for the supervisor and the airship.

I started narrating to the camera, and she was like, are you talking to me?  No.  No, I'm never talking.  I'm never talking to the police.  Or very rarely.  Very little upside.  It's... Oh, she just turned her body camera on now.  No, there's somebody in this vehicle right here.  There's somebody in this Chevy pickup truck.  Illuminus, that would probably be her.  036813, Surgeon April Phillips.  How much does she make a year?  168,000?  That's my guess.  Officer Droopy Pants.  Yeah, you think they could get a tailor or something?  I don't know, I mean.  Yeah, exactly, Johnny.  Does she usually investigate without her body camera on?  I don't know.  I would think, listen, I'm here to do an investigation and I have one, two, three, four, five, six, I have six cameras running because I'm doing an investigation.  So I would think that if police, that the police would definitely have cameras on if they were doing an investigation.  No, no, she's totally eyeballed.  She can totally hear what I'm saying.  I'm talking loudly on purpose.  How much does she make a year?  168?  Well, no, exactly about, but I mean, there's somebody supposedly.  I don't know.  I didn't see anybody, but... Listen, you can... You can cheat on your sergeant's exam.  I mean, that, you know... Oh, my God.  Angel was like, I heard a leaf blower.  Is that her?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, what's her... Somebody go on transparentcalifornia.com.  And look for Sergeant April Phillips, LAPD.  Well, she didn't even have the body camera on either, so she's been doing an investigation without a body cam.  So there's a... There's a thumbs up for transparency right there.  I'm sorry?  I'm talking to my chat.  Can you be quiet, please, for a minute?  I'm talking to my chat.  Can you be quiet, please?  You're interrupting my investigation.  What's your name, sir?  I don't have to... What?  Am I under arrest right now?  Am I detained?  I'm trying to have a conversation with you.  Trying to talk to you, trying to just ask what's going on, how your day is, but you don't even want to answer any of my questions.  Gentlemen, how are you?  Will you please answer my questions and just say hello back?  That's all I'm asking.  Having a conversation that is... You interrupted my... I've got a live stream.  You just came up and interrupted and you're calling me rude?  Seriously.  I'm talking to my chat.  It's not about you, Phillips.  You came up... I don't want to be engaged in a conversation.  I would be engaging you in a conversation.  if I wanted to be engaged in a conversation.  Seriously.  Seriously, you should turn your body camera on if you're doing an investigation too, so... Just a tip, but... My God.  What is... She makes $90,000 a year?  Wow, there's... Talk about women... I love when cops call you rude.  They come up and interrupt you.  You're talking to 500 people in a chat.  They walk up to you and say you're being rude.  Like, for interrupting.  Like, what is the rationale there?  This is delusional. ",

She was worried about what I was saying about her, so she thought I was, you know... Do you have a question?  Yeah.  How about you stop talking?  Sir, you're being rude right now.  I love how they try to turn it around on you, man, like you're the asshole.  You know what I mean?  Listen to me.  I'm trying to talk to you.  Yeah.  I'm going to come and interrupt your 500-person live stream, but you're being a rude guy.  Exactly, Data Cooke.  65% of a man's salary.  She'd be making at least a buck and a half.  That salary doesn't sound right.  No.  No, there's no way she's making under six figures.  No.  Steve-O says her dog is kicked tonight.  They're white.  Yeah, listen, there's no way you're making 90... Listen, there's regular beat cops making 90 grand a year.  If you're a sergeant, even if you're a new sergeant, you're making a buck and a quarter.  That was golden.  You know what?  If you just... We went from a mediocre interaction where I shushed her to gold, to comedy gold, where she came up for part two, for act two.  She had to come up and talk more.  The last time.  Oh, okay.  $153,000 with benefits?  That sounds more.  Yeah, that's definitely more.  Well, she's female also, so, I mean.  So, 95 plus 153 with OT and benefits.  Thank you.  Roscon.  Roscon, you're being rude right now, Roscon.  Okay, you interrupted me and you typed in the chat.  As you were thinking.  I know.  Roscon, do you not know how chats work?  You are to speak when spoken to, Roscon.  Anytime you want me to pick up, just tell me.  Right by his cab.  This is gold.  This is absolute gold.  Lightfighter, we're watching... Watching a train wreck is what we're watching.  He's out of cuffs.  He's out of cuffs, though.  Look, so they closed the sidewalks.  So look, so now people have to walk in the street and risk their lives.  I've been preparing for this moment my entire life.  Because LAPD is doing an investigation.  Look, they're going to walk into the center lane now.  Watch.  Yep, they don't want to get shot.  They don't want to keep walking on the sidewalk because they were watching the live stream.  They don't want to be called rude.  Exactly, Denise.  What's your name?  Am I under arrest?  Is this your first date?  What is... No, I just want to have a conversation with you.  Well, I don't want to have one with you, so... Look how that works.  I think these guys are leaving.  They're leaving.  It looks like these guys are free to go here.  And your fan club.  Well, Sergeant.  What's up, man?  I don't know if this guy's free to go yet.  He's out of handcuffs, though.  No, no nugs were harmed in the filming of this video.  None.  Zero.  Zero nugs.  This guy yelled something at me when I came up saying that I was late.  The guy in the LA hat.  I thought this was going to be a really slow night, and it was a slow night.  And then Sergeant Phillips made it amazing.  Okay, sorry, Hank.  What's the highest paid police?  Go on transparentcalifornia.com.  And I think the chief of police makes like a million three or something like that.  Who's the highest paid sergeant?  We're live on YouTube, man.  You good?  You safe?  Okay, dude, they were calling in an air... Yeah?  Okay.  They were calling an airship and shit, man.  So we came over and then there was another call.  Okay.  Okay, so the camera helped?  Okay, cool.  Cool, cool, cool.  Alright, man.  Alright, be good, dude.  Always film the police, dude.  All right, I got that on my body camera.  He just said if the camera wasn't here, he said.  the only reason he is going right now is because the camera showed up.  He is a subscriber to the channel.  He's seen my videos.  He has seen my videos.  And he is 100% convinced.  the only reason he is leaving right now is because of the camera.  And people say that what we do doesn't make a difference.  It certainly made a big difference to him, didn't it?  Yep.  See, the problem is a lot of people, when they see a camera in a situation like this, they get embarrassed because they're about to be arrested and they're not, you know, I get it.  That guy was not embarrassed at all.  He said, dude, you're late.  He said something about, dude, you're late.  So he's like, yeah, man, I've seen your videos.  You are the reason that I am leaving tonight.  Whoa, look at that.  A white car.  Denise just hit her wet head. ",
