            "text": "Now you wouldn't want nothing to do with the cow.  But look at what having a cow and being a thinker allows man to do from the earth.  From the brain of the cow, you get anti-aging cream and medicines.  From the blood of the cow, they make pasta.  Imitation eggs, cake mixes, dyes and inks, adhesives, minerals, medicines, laboratory research materials.  just from the brain.  From the bones, refined sugar, charcoal, fertilizer, glass.  From a cow.  See, when you call her your earth, you're saying it everything you need.  To make life what life should be is right sitting up in a woman that we are mistreating.  So when you call her earth, then honor and respect her as earth.  And don't spit on the earth.  Don't mistreat the earth.  Take care of the earth and the earth will take care of you and me.  Now look at this.  From the heavens, Of the cow, air filters, brushes, felt, insulation, plaster, textiles.  From the skin, gelatin, flavorings, emery boards, sheetrock, wallpaper, adhesives, medicines, candies, and confectionery.  This is from a cow.  From the fat, chewing gum.  candles, detergent, fabric softener, deodorant, shaving cream, perfume, pet food, cosmetics, creams and lotions, crayons, paint, oils and lubricants, biodiesel, plastics, waterproofing agents, cement, ceramic, chalk, explosives.  That's why you can't mess with this earth, man.  When she explode on us, brother, we in trouble.  Fireworks, we got a lot of that coming out of the cow.  Fertilizer, that's what that boy used to blow up the building in Oklahoma.  Antifreeze, insulation.  Linoleum, rubber, textiles, medicine.  Now let's look at the manure.  You ain't through with that cow yet?  From the manure, you get fertilizer, nitrogen, and phosphorus.  From the milk, adhesives, plastics, cosmetics, and medicines.  Now you know Queen Elizabeth, I read today, drinks raw milk.  She understands.  How old is the woman?  She up there, right?  Drinking raw milk.  Don't let nobody pasteurize your milk.  So you're dying now, but you don't know it because somebody is feeding you the wrong type of food.  Now, the internal organs, and if you play guitar, play the violin, you get instrument strings from the organs.  Tennis racket strings.  from the internal organs, hormones, enzymes, vitamins, and other medical materials.  From the hooves and the horns, you get adhesives, plastic, pet food, plant food, photo film, shampoo and conditioner, lamination, wallpaper, plywood.  So when you say you are vegan, You better be careful how you talk.  I don't have nothing to do with the cow.  Yeah, right. ",
