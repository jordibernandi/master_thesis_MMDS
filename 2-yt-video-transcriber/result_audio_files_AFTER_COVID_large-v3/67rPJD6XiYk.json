But this is, first of all, I love her.  She said here's, she said the vast majority of legal scholars have indicated he cannot pardon himself.  What he could do is step down and allow Pence to pardon him.  I suspect he will pardon his family members, his children, his son-in-law and individuals in his administration, as well as some of his close associates.  And then I suspect at some point in time he will step down and allow the vice president to pardon him.  It's important to understand.  he is pardoned from federal crimes.  He is not pardoned from state crimes.  Last year I introduced a bill in the state legislature which would close the pardon loophole.  so that individuals such as the President of the United States would not evade justice.  It's important we have this check on presidential powers.  The state legislature, I'm so happy they passed the bill.  It is now the law of the state of New York.  President Trump cannot avoid justice in the great state of New York.  Yeah, it's, I mean, I can't, what we're watching, I just said yesterday, Jim Clyburn called insurrection or sedition or whatever you want to call it, right?

I don't doubt for a minute that he's going to have his own counter-inauguration rally going.

Look at what's happening in Arizona.  The Arizona Republican Party just asked its supporters if it's willing to die for Trump's election fraud lies.  This is why there's no, I just said earlier, there's no difference now between the lunatic fringe and the Republican Party.  They fired off a pair of tweets that appeared to encourage Trump supporters to give their lives as part of an effort to overturn the election.  The group retweeted Ali Alexander, leader of Stop the Steal.  He said, I'm willing to give my life for this fight.  The Arizona GOP shared that with however many Twitter followers he is.  They said in the retweet, are you?  About an hour later, they used a clip from Rambo in which he says, this is what we do, who we are, live for nothing or die for something.  And as the Philadelphia Inquirer said, Malcolm, where you're from, if some random yahoo in Arizona kills someone in the name of Trump staying in office, will Arizona GOP Chair Kelly Ward be charged as an accessory?

No.  Throughout the campaign season.  and culminating in October, it became very clear to me that these people were not going to take this lightly.  If Trump had won, they would have considered themselves a paramilitary, like the brown shirts.  If Trump loses, which he has, they are planning insurgency.  And these sort of statements that you hear from the Republican Party, which amp up the eliminationist rhetoric, amp up the belief that you have to fight for something.  You know, this is what the period between 1855 and 1860 was like, right?  Everybody just one step further.  Maybe we should fight them.  Maybe we should leave.  You know, this is seditious.  In fact, it is calling essentially for rebellion against the legitimate government of the United States.  Donald Trump is the only factor that this has not exploded.  And there has been this merger and will be a solid merger within the next year of the Trump campaign out of power, the Republican base, including the party, and the QAnon conspiracy theory.  Right.
