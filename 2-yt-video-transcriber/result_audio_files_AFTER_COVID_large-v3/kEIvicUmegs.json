But I think grappling because in most self-defense situations, it usually winds up with grappling.  You're definitely better off, though, knowing some striking because there's nothing more terrifying than when you go to take someone down.  They actually have takedown skills, but they can fight.  And so they have takedown defense, and they know how to fight, and then you don't know how to stand up.  The worst thing in the world is seeing someone reaching who doesn't know how to do striking, and someone cracks you. ",

In general, the people that say that suck.  yeah that's anybody who thinks like someone's like you know hey man i'll just bite you.  i'm like are you gonna bite me?  okay do you think i'm gonna bite you too?  what do you think of that?  what if i punch you in your fucking face you think you're still gonna bite me when you can't even see?  yeah when you you're you barely even know you're alive and i choke you unconscious.  if someone's really good at jujitsu good luck.  stabbing them with your keys.  you know you don't have a chance.  You don't have a chance.  If someone's much better at you and they trip you and get you on your back and then they fucking elbow you in your face and get a head and arm choke on you, all that Krav Maga shit's out the window, son.  You're way better off learning what works on trained killers.  Like this whole idea that you're going to poke someone in the eye and then you're going to kick them in the nuts.  Like you're going through these drills that, yeah, it's good to know what to do if you run into someone who doesn't know how to fight.  It's way better to know what to do to someone who knows how to fight.  That's the best thing.  Learn how to fight against people who know how to fight.  Like all that practice self-defense.  And they're going to come at you with a knife.  You're going to grab the wrist and do that.  Like it's good to know self-defense.  But it's much more important to understand martial arts comprehensively.  When you understand martial arts comprehensively, like there's no Krav \u2013 I shouldn't say there's no Krav Maga guys, but it would be shocking if a Krav Maga guy and a mixed martial arts guy had a fight and the mixed martial arts guy who's a trained killer all around didn't fuck that guy up.  That's what I would expect would happen.  I would not think that some guy who has a little bit of this and a little bit of that and prepares for the streets is going to be able to handle a person who trains with killers on a day-to-day basis, who rolls with jiu-jitsu black belts, who trains with Muay Thai champions.  The best martial arts are the martial arts that work on martial artists, not the martial arts that work on untrained people. ",
