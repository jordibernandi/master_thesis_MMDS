            "text": "So tonight, Donald Trump goes on with ABC News, George Stephanopoulos in a town hall, 90 minutes.  Trump can easily parry that.  Stephanopoulos is not.  Stephanopoulos will hit him on a COVID Woodward stuff.  He'll hit him on that.  But Trump should easily be able to swat that away.  And then the questions by the people... You know, they're not pros.  A lot of them will be softballs.  A lot of them, no follow-ups.  So this is like 90 minutes of free publicity for Donald Trump, courtesy of ABC News.  So ABC asked the Biden campaign, hey, we're going to give Trump 90 minutes in a town hall.  We'd like to have Joe come on in.  And the Biden campaign goes, we can't find a date.  Now, I'm sorry.  I don't want to be cruel.  And I certainly don't want to be unfair.  I really, really don't.  But I'm a pro.  I've been doing this a long time.  I mean, I've been covering presidential politics since 1976.  Okay?  You are running for president.  A network offers you 90 minutes of cupcake time.  Cupcake time.  And you say you can't find a date?  Come on.  So this proves to me there's something wrong with Mr.  Biden.  I had a little bit of doubt before this that he might just be in and out like Ronald Reagan was after he was shot, which I write about extensively in Killing Reagan.  Ronald Reagan was up and down.  And I said, maybe that's Biden and maybe he'll come back.  But if his campaign won't take 90 minutes of free airtime six weeks before an election, you know there's something wrong. ",
