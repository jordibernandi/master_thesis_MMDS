            "text": "hey what's up everybody?  this is Dante Fortson here with go ask your pastor episode 4 black Jews deported to West Africa.  this is gonna come back to haunt the UA community soon but first before we get into that today's episode is brought to you by ministry gone wrong.  if your ministry needs to raise money for extra security measures as a birthday gift your ministry has gone terribly wrong.  now I'm no expert here but I'm assuming it has something to do with him dressing up like Muhammad because it offends about.  you know a little over a billion people on the planet and they think it's an offense worthy of death and then he goes out on the corner dressed like Muhammad to harass black people about needing to squat when they pee.  So if you would like to see a Sicilian guy make one bad life decision after another, pop on over to Vocab Malone's channel and check out what he has over there.  All right.  So Go Ask Your Pastor.  is a new series on the channel where I try to get you kicked out of church for asking stuff you probably shouldn't ask your pastor.  but you really should ask your pastor this stuff because it's based in factual history.  all right so today's evidence.  we're gonna be talking about the black Jews that were kicked out of Portugal and deported to West Africa.  I'm gonna come back to this in a deeper study very soon sooner than you probably think but I'm gonna go ahead and read this for you.  for those who do not believe that there were Jews in West Africa at all I'm gonna start at the the top here at the word.  thus since this other sentence is cut off the discovery and hold on before I start reading this just notice that the F and then the S is like right here.  on Portuguese they look very similar.  so I'm gonna try not to mess this up as I read because the F and the F's and the S's start to look the same after a while going through this.  all right the discovery of the Gold Coast served indeed yet more to enlarge the sphere of the navigation of the Portuguese than their slave trade but it forced them also to extend themselves on the coast and to settle colonies in Congo Angola and other places which they had till then neglected.  Prince Henry's colonies were enlarged by his successors.  King John II in 1492 expelled all the Jews to the island of St.  Thomas or Sao Tome, as it's called on many maps, which had been discovered in 1471 and to other Portuguese settlements on the continent of Africa.  and from these banished jews the black portuguese as they were called or as they are called and the jews and leongo that's also on the western coast of africa who are despised even by the very negroes are descended by these colonies.  let me yeah by these colin.  i think there's colonists let me make sure by these yeah by these colonists.  st.  Thomas soon became a considerable place of trade and valuable for its sugar plantations 30 years after their settlement not less than 165 thousand Arabs of 30 pounds weight each.  I think this maybe this air robes maybe that's a measurement of 30 pounds weight each of sugar were exported and the engines of 60 sugar works turned by Flavie slaves.  there we go these Negroes were purchased in Guinea Congo.  many Let me see.  Manny Congo and the colonists had plantations furnished with one hundred and fifty to three hundred thousand Negro slaves.  In the beginning of the 16th century, the Spanish Spaniards and Portuguese began to transport Negroes for familiar for familiar labors to the West Indies and Brazil's.  Now, real quick.  So they deported these black Portuguese from Spain and are black Jews from Spain and Portugal.  Now, it says in the beginning of the 16th century, that's the 1500s.  Spanish and the Portuguese began to transport Negroes for familiar labors to the West Indies and Brazil.  now the term the West Indies is America.  remember they were looking for the Indies when they found the place to America.  the West Indies and Brazil the South America and North America the islands all of that area by which the Negro trade was wrapped rapidly increased.  the Spaniards were their first settling in the West Indies.  immediately treated the natives of that part of the globe according let me see let me make sure that's right.  yeah immediately treated the natives of that part of the globe.  according to the Pope's instruction.  they divided them by families or districts among themselves as slaves.  the poor Indians were now forced to die for pearls to wash gold.  to wash gold wanted for their exigencies I think that's the word but soon found them too weak to support long and hard labors.  so those that believe we are Native Americans notice they're differentiating.  they're saying the natives were weaker than the Negroes.  this is why they're transporting Negroes in and it's gonna explain it.  Bishop Lascafas in generally is generally thought to have been the first to advise The Spaniards to import slaves from Africa in order to spare the Indians.  But our author shows that before that time, Moorish and even Negro slaves were sent to America.  Las Caffas merits.  Let me see.  Consisted in saving South America from an entire depopulation.  What before him had already been done by private Spanish individuals.  He procured to be done by a general royal order or he proposed Negroes instead of the few Moorish slaves who had till then been sent to America.  So he's saying the Moors were sent to America first because see one of the.  one of the narratives is that the first the first slaves owners here were blacker and it's only really one guy.  but it's telling us here that the Moors were sent first.  and I know the Moors and the and the Israelites overlap in some cases but they're telling us that they differentiated between the Moors and the Negroes.  so me before that time Moorish and even Negro slaves were sent to America lost coffers.  merits consisted in saving the South oh goodness these letters and saving this saving South America from an entire depopulation.  what before him had been already done by private Spanish individuals he procured to be done by general royal order or he he proposed Negroes instead of the more slaves who had till then been sent to America.  he also deserved well of the commerce of America by procuring his.  let me see.  Yeah, we're going to click that.  Let me see.  I think that's that.  the Negro slaves by procuring by his Ramon.  I don't know what that word is like.  Those two letters are kind of stuck together.  that the Negro slaves who before, like all other necessaries, had been sent from that word right there is kind of messed up.  Seville or other Spanish harbors were to be directly transported from Guinea to the West Indies and that of.  I think that's that.  Of course, America was more expeditiously furnished with the laborers wanted.  Lascafa's proposal was executed in 1517.  The quarter traded Seville appointed 4000 Negroes to be annually transported to the islands of St.  St.  Domingo.  ford fernandina puerto rico and jamaica and charles v granted the monopoly of this slave trade to the counselor and major domo de la breffa for eight years who in his turn sold his grant for that time to former.  anyways is basically it goes on to see the trade of choice farmers probably created let me see created with the term of the eight years as wow it's a whole lot of solar slaves too.  yeah so anyway it goes on.  but basically what happened was the slave trade kicks off and it was the black Jews that were deported from Spain and Portugal to the West Indies I'm sorry the West Africa that were then taken over to the Americas and the islands and South America And this tells you that these were the same people.  Now, we're going to come back to this later, but there's a link to this in the description.  If you want to try to go through and read this for yourself, the font is hard on the eyes and the S's and F's start to look alike after a while.  So it's kind of hard to like.  read directly through.  But the link is there for those who want to go through this, take their time and read it.  It does provide all the evidence you're looking for that there were indeed Israelites in West Africa when the slave trade started.  So go ask your pastor.  your pastor owes you some answers.  if they are not telling you about this if they don't know it's not a problem.  help them get educated on it.  but if they do know and they're not telling you it should be a problem for you.  so make sure you grab your copy of undeniable full-color evidence of black Israelites in the Bible if you don't already have it and grab your copy of the black Hebrew awakening if you want the history of our people broken down.  so with that said until next time I'm out.
