            "text": "Hello everyone, this is TurflingyMonkey.  Welcome to a new sex toy review.  Today's product is Britney, the 29.67 pound sexy f-cup big breast sister with nice booty by Tantally.  So I have two cameras going.  One of them is my scissor mic stand.  1080p camera.  the other one is my cell phone on a tripod because this really doesn't fit on my desk.  so a little bit awkward.  hopefully you go with me anyway.  this is you know it's a hobbit torso.  I reviewed these before.  these tend to be smaller scaled down torsos.  they're a lot cheaper than a full-size doll as you can see.  no arms no head no legs but it's got all the other things.  something I was very surprised with with this is it actually has a skeleton.  So previously, when I've reviewed Hobbit torsos, they're just solid TPE.  There's no skeleton.  So they flop around a lot, which can be an issue.  But with this one, I mean, I'll try to show you.  I don't know how I can really demonstrate it.  There's a skeleton in here.  It is bendable.  It takes a little bit of work, but there is a skeleton in this toy.  It obviously has breasts, vagina, anus.  The booty looks good.  The measurements.  So is this life-size?  So, is this life-size?  Uh, yes and no, it depends on what you're looking at.  So, the breasts are the same size as Celestina's, the hips are the same size as Celestina's, however, the waist is kind of truncated.  So, I'll do a side-by-side.  Celestina's waist from, you know, basically where her chin ends, that part of her neck, down to her clitoris, is 24 inches.  and for this toy it's only 17 inches.  and the main difference is there should be a lot more space on the waist.  so they basically cut out like her ribs.  she has no ribs like it goes from her breasts directly to her stomach and there's like no ribs where celestina.  she has a more realistic torso length.  however.  celestina weighs 70 pounds and brittany she weighs less than 30 pounds.  So she's, it's less than half, less than half.  30 pounds is still pretty heavy.  So trying to use this doll in different positions can get pretty hard.  Now it is shorter, again, 17 inches for this doll versus 24 inches for the same approximate body measurement for Celestina, who's about 5'6\".  So certain positions work better than others.  Cowgirl, reverse cowgirl worked fine.  But missionary was awkward because the doll is on the smaller side.  So you're not going to get that face-to-face contact even though there is in the head.  So that could be awkward.  So just be aware of the positions you're into.  Girl on top works fine.  Doggy style works fine.  The reason why the legs are in this weird kind of position is so you can flip it over for doggy style.  So I'll show you that.  So you can see there's the booty.  So there's the booty.  When it's in this position, the legs basically act as a base.  You can use this for doggy style.  Not much else to say.  Everything worked.  Everything felt good.  I can't really complain about that.  All right, let's do some, I guess, jiggle tests.  So here's the titties jiggling.  Brittany's breasts are a little bit bigger than Celestina.  Celestina is a D cup or a double D cup, I think.  Might be an E cup.  But Brittany is an F cup.  She's one cup size bigger.  But you can't really tell.  The breasts feel real, so no complaints there.  The vagina feels real.  Let me see if I can get that in frame.  All right, so there's the vagina and there's the anus.  Very, very realistic.  I was very impressed with the realism of the vagina and the anus.  It does come with two drying rods, so it is a fixed vagina.  There's no removable insert, but it's a lot easier to clean than you think because it has the drying rods.  But you will have to manually clean this.  But if you're used to fixed vagina dolls, it's no different.  Okay, so here's the thing about this doll.  It's heavy.  It's less than 30 pounds, but it's a compact 30 pounds.  However, I will say this.  They make bigger dolls.  They have one called Aurora.  that's probably, like, life-size.  It costs, like, 500 bucks, though.  However, however, Aurora's, like, too big to probably do for cowgirl or reverse cowgirl.  I found that Brittany was about as heavy as you could reasonably have.  If Britney were heavier, it would make cowgirl reverse cowgirl too awkward.  But 30 pounds is about the limit for a comfortable session.  So Aurora weighs like almost 60 pounds, which is only like 10 pounds less than Celestina.  And that is way too heavy.  So if you use VR and you want reverse cowgirl or cowgirl or any kind of girl on top... This is probably as heavy as you want to go.  The fact that it has a skeleton and the fact that it's less than $300 is a really, really good deal.  You are getting less doll because you're paying less money.  As long as you're aware of that, as long as you're okay with that, just understand what you're getting.  30 pounds is a good thing for a VR doll.  If you ordered the ass that I reviewed like a month ago for VR, this is kind of the same thing, except this one also has breasts.  So you can do additional things other than just use the vagina slash ass.  There's other positions, other ways to interact if you use VR.  These torsos work very well with VR.  This is more or less life-size.  If they stretched out the waist a bit, this would be life-size.  But it's kind of squished down.  This would be like a short stack torso.  So she has adult proportions in the hips and the breasts, but the waist is squished down to make the overall doll smaller.  But it's not smaller as if it's scaled down like a Barbie doll.  It's just smushed down in the waist area to make the doll, you know, more compact.  So it's a midget.  It's a short stack.  It's a hobbit.  So if you're into that, if you're into short stacks, this might just be the doll for you.  If you're into VR, this is probably the doll for you because this is a lot cheaper.  You're not going to be worried as much about breaking it.  The fact that it has a skeleton is very impressive.  Everything feels real.  As a doll owner, as a doll lover, I approve of the quality of this doll.  It has a skeleton, which I've never seen in a Hobbit torso before.  So these dolls are legit.  The detail is good.  The weight is good.  The price is good.  Even their most expensive doll, the Aurora doll, is less than $600, which is pretty good.  It doesn't have a head, so that's an issue.  But if you use VR or something like that, you should be okay.  So that is Brittany.  It's a good doll.  And you're going to know if you're going to be into this.  Now, maybe Brittany isn't for you.  I'll put a picture up of Tantally's entire line of dolls.  So maybe Brittany's on the small side and you want to go a little bit bigger.  You want to go with Aurora.  You could check her out on the Tantally website.  Or maybe you want to go smaller.  Maybe 30 pounds is too much.  You want to go a little bit smaller.  You could do that.  I do have a 15% off coupon code for Britney.  So use the code to say 15% if you want to buy this doll.  And then 15% off, so it's already $270.  Minus 15%, it's a pretty good deal.  And this is a legit sex doll.  This isn't just a piece of TP, it has a skeleton.  I don't know if I can demonstrate that, but... It's hard to demonstrate the skeleton.  You can tell it's there, I can feel it.  Like here, actually, let me see.  See how I'm holding with one arm?  If this didn't have a skeleton, this would basically floppily go down, but it's not.  I'm holding it up with one arm because the skeleton is supporting it.  So this does have a skeleton, which no other Hobbit torso I've ever seen has.  Anyway, these lights are hot.  This doll is heavy.  I'm done.  Say 15% with the code.  This is TurflingMonkey.  Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time. ",
