            "text": "What my research is telling me is that we should not write Neanderthals out of the human race.  There has been a major... shift in scientific opinion among paleoanthropologists about the cognitive capacities and humanity of Neanderthal man.  He is not some sort of brutish, primitive ape man.  Rather he had a brain capacity comparable to Homo sapiens, even larger than Homo sapiens, and he exhibited modern behaviors comparable to those exhibited by Homo sapiens.  Just a couple weeks ago, they found a piece of string in France in a cave that is associated with Neanderthal remains, which is made out of the fibers of the inner lining of bark from a gymnosperm tree, The fibers were twisted in a clockwise direction, then three of the strands were twisted in a counterclockwise direction to make this piece of string.  The excavators of this dig said that this exhibits the kind of complexity that is required for mathematical thinking and language ability.  So I think it is utterly prejudicial to say that Neanderthals were not human beings.  Now if that's right, that means that Adam and Eve need to be the ancestors not only of Homo sapiens but also of Neanderthals.  And that's going to put them back somewhere around 750,000 to 500,000 years ago.  And so I think putting Adam and Eve that far back is perfectly consonant with scientific evidence, in particular with the much ballyhooed evidence of population genetics.  Population genetics is entirely consistent with the origin of the entire human race who has ever lived on the face of this planet from a founding pair who lived sometime prior to 500,000 years ago.
