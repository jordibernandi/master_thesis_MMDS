I could not have imagined that when I started the campaign.  I'm a fairly normal guy, and so you don't expect to show up someplace and have a bunch of people holding up posters with your face on it.  You're like, whoa.  Very unanticipated.  And the other thing I'd say, and this is something you're intimately familiar with, is really the role of the media.  Like oftentimes the media had a particular narrative they wanted to push and then they would kind of make the candidates fit the narrative.  And I thought that was unjust to some of the candidates that never really got a chance to.  You know, like there were 24 candidates that ran or even more.  And some of them I thought never got any kind of hearing.  And I thought that was really unfortunate. ",

And so I said to them, wouldn't my staying in longer help the movement more?  And then they convinced me that actually, if you drop out earlier when the numbers are clear, then it will help the movement grow, and here is why.  Some breaking news right now from Zareen Shah at Andrew Yang's headquarters there in New Hampshire.  He's dropping out.  His campaign just told us that he is dropping out tonight.
