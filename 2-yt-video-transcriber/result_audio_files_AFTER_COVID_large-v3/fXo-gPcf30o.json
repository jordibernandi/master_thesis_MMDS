            "text": "Hi, I'm Liam Neeson.  Human trafficking is the fastest growing illegal global business, generating 150 billion US dollars each year.  It is the second largest criminal industry in the world.  Almost 25 million people are trafficked each year, and one in four victims are under the age of 18.  Most of us would imagine that human trafficking involves someone being kidnapped, trafficked within their own countries and cities, and coerced into exploitation often by people they know.  During high-profile events and major sporting events, with the influx of hundreds and thousands of people into the hosting cities, exploitation can increase.  People are trafficked for forced labor and sexual exploitation, regardless of age, background, or location.  Traffickers may threaten their victims with violence or blackmail, take advantage of their vulnerability, or promise an opportunity for a better life in order to control them.  Here are some of the signs to look out for.  Victims may be easily startled, agitated, or afraid, unsure of where they are or lack official ID, unable to explain injuries or possessions, may have strange markings, brownings, tattoos, have unexplained hotel use, be accompanied by a suspicious companion.  Children can be dressed up to look older than they are.  If you're watching this and you are being exploited or you think you have seen something, then say something.  Join our campaign.  Together we can end exploitation and human trafficking.  Thank you. ",
