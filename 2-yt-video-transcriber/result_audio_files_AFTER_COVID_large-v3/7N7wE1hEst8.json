            "text": "Blacksit family, Blacksit family, Blacksit family.  Now, I've got no cameraman, my husband's not here, it's late at night, and I've come here to give an unusual message, actually.  So Blacksit family, for anyone who hasn't tuned into the Blacksit channel before, I'm Juliet and I'm the CEO and founder of Blacksit, just to make my position clear.  And also to give you a bit of background into who I am and what I do.  I am an African of African descent who has traversed through time Unfortunately, being a descendant of our ancestors who were enslaved by the wicked and evil people that embarked on centuries and centuries of murderous and evil tirades on us Africans across the continent and dispersed us across the world.  Now, why am I talking today?  I'm talking because I live in Africa and it's the best move I ever made.  I need to make this clear.  I need to make this transparently clear to everybody that's watching.  I love living in Africa.  I love being African.  I love my skin, my natural skin.  I love my natural hair.  I love everything about my African identity.  And today I've been to like various locations.  And, you know, I've been mixing with my beautiful, beautiful African family here.  And my beautiful, beautiful Blacksit family here.  And I've read some of the comments about our previous video and I just wanted to set the record straight.  Me being African is my birthright.  A piece of paper given to me by any government will never erase my history.  It will never erase the fact that my great-great-grandparents are African and are from West Africa, be it Gambia, be it Sierra Leone, be it Nigeria, be they Ebu or Yoruba.  Be it Gabon.  Be it Burkina Faso.  Be it Tongo.  It could be Mali.  It could be Senegal.  Being African is our birthright.  It is our birthright.  I live here and I wake up happy.  I have a family, an extended family here.  like I've never had.  I've got support here like I've never had.  I have a life here like I never had.  So I don't want to see negative comments and things.  Let me tell you something, when I sit down on the beach and I watch the sea and I see our families on beach day, family day, family day, I celebrate, I enjoy it.  I love to be a part of it.  I wasn't involved in any of that in the UK.  In fact, we were isolated.  We were discriminated against.  Most of the women friends that I had who were black like me were depressed, unhappy.  We were having issues around our careers, issues around our workplaces, issues around our relationships, issues around our finances, issues around the relationships that we were having with people in our day-to-day lives.  It wasn't a happy existence.  So, you know, I just want to say that, you know, I'm living happy and I want everybody else to live happy.  I saw a comment telling me that I should return to the UK.  Are you mad?  Are you totally insane?  Why would I ever want to do that?  It's an absolute absurd statement to make.  And that leads me into really what I came to talk about probably five minutes into the video, as I always do.  But the fact is that I want to talk about saviour syndrome and saviour complex.  And it's something that we need to really address, brothers and sisters.  Only we can be our own saviours.  Stop waiting for the white man or any other man or woman to do it for us.  Only we can save ourselves.  I'm sick and tired of hearing statements that refer to anybody but us being the solution to our issues.  Only we can be the solution, black solutions for black issues.  Black challenges mean black action.  That's what it means.  It's just as simple as that.  We have to, we have to take charge of our own destiny.  We have to take charge of our own future.  We have a responsibility, not only to ourselves, but to future generations.  I will not be a black apathetic.  I will not be a black pathetic.  And I will not be a black... I don't even know what to say.  I'm not going to be... What's the word?  I know what the word is.  Impartial.  I'm not gonna be impartial anymore, I've had enough.  I'm not gonna be apathetic anymore, I've had enough.  I'm not gonna be stagnated by anybody anymore, I've had enough.  Now, I had dreams, prophetic dreams before I came here.  And in those dreams, I had an urgent call to get out.  To get out.  Juliet, get out.  Juliet, get out.  Get out.  Get out.  And do you know what?  I heeded those dreams.  Be they from my ancestors, but I heeded them to get out.  And now with what I'm seeing, borders closing and stuff happening around the world with coronavirus, I can sit in my house happy.  I'm not even stressed about it.  Because the lifestyle you live here is different.  You live in your own compound.  You don't even have to see people if you don't want to.  You don't have to mix with people if you don't want to.  You don't have to live in a block of flats where you have to worry about who's standing next to you in the lift and whether they're affected or not.  You can go and buy your beans from a farm in a remote area and bring all your food back to your house.  without having to be in contact with a lot of people.  What I'm trying to say is that there's a solution.  I was also told that viruses find it hard to live in very hot conditions.  Now, where is it very hot?  It's very hot in Africa.  Also, your herbs and your cures are here.  So, I didn't really want to have a rant, but I just wanted the people to know that the issue about citizenship, yeah, it's an ongoing one.  However, it doesn't prevent me from living here.  It doesn't prevent me from living a better life.  And it certainly doesn't prevent me from living in my home.  It doesn't prevent me from educating my son.  It doesn't prevent me.  And I don't want to think that any politicians or anyone that I'm having a dick is.  I'm not.  What I am saying is that This situation has to be addressed anyway because we are coming home.  And we need to be accommodated in a way in which we will not be offended.  And that's why I'm asking you to take out your sensibilities, your sensitivity and understanding and know where we're coming from.  We are descendants of the enslaved which were forcibly taken from here.  We were forcibly taken from Africa and we are Africans.  An orange tree because it is grown in China or grown in England or grown in France does not make it not an orange tree.  Regardless of where it was grown, it's still an orange tree.  And as the old saying goes here in Gambia, no matter how long a log will lay in the river, it will never be a crocodile.  And we are the crocodiles coming back home and we need to be respected as such.  Now I'm asking everybody, We need to be our own saviour.  The saviour complex syndrome where we look for the answers everywhere outside of ourselves and people telling me that, you know, this issue with citizenship.  Listen, I am home.  I am in my own house, in my own compound in Africa.  I am home.  And I want you to know that.  I'm not looking over my shoulder at any white policeman wanting to arrest me for something that I didn't do.  I'm not looking over my shoulder at a racist who might want to attack me for nothing else other than being black.  I'm not worried about when I take my son to school that he's going to be attacked because he's black.  I am not worried when I walk down the street that I am going to be attacked because I'm black.  However, there is a serious issue of the rise in racism around the world and how it is affecting us as a people.  And there needs to be a discussion about that.  So I'm asking you all, club, together, find a way and come home.  Even if you have to build a sanctuary, but come home.  It's time.  I don't want anyone to be caught in countries because of coronavirus and then they never get to get out.  I'm not scaremongering.  I'm just saying that, you know, I was having an inner voice calling me to get out.  And I listened to my inner voice and I got out.  And I'm saying to you, if you have that inner calling, then it's time for you to leave too.  It's time for you to leave too.  This is a heartfelt plea.  I'm telling you that sometimes, sometimes you have to visualize the future in your own heart and your own mind.  And so I'm asking you to do that.  I'm not going against anyone's personal beliefs, but what I am saying is that savior syndrome has to be us.  We have to save ourselves.  I don't know what's going on completely with this coronavirus, but I know one thing, viruses don't like heat.  So Black Zip family, listen, that was like my kind of rants in a way Just to say, and I want to assure you that coming home has been the best solution for me, still and always will be.  The issue of an ID card is really a misnomer.  Yes, I have to pay.  Yes, it annoys me.  Yes, I'm not so happy about the fact that they haven't rolled out the red carpet as yet across the whole of Africa.  But, you know, like I said, Africa's had its fair share of damage and colonialism.  We all have and we're all damaged.  We are all damaged.  What I have to say is this.  The future is going to change.  And we have to be the change that we want to see.  So with that said, I'm going to say goodbye.  It was just a little shout out.  This is like no intro, no outro, no anything.  But I just wanted to appeal.  And I also want you to know that yes, I survive on donations.  I've been asked about YouTube.  No, we still haven't had any money from YouTube.  And yes, we're still surviving on donations from Blacksit subscribers via PayPal.  So if you'd like to support us, you can via PayPal by using the bopcollective at yahoo.com email address.  That's bopcollective.com.  At yahoo.com.  Email address.  Or you can become a long term supporter.  Via Patreon.  Or you can send us a donation.  By Western Union or APS.  By emailing us at.  Blacksit.com.  So I am urging everybody.  To please try.  And make a plan B. Please try.  And have a plan B. Blacksit family.  I sense something is going on.  So this is like an emergency call, okay?  This is like an emergency call out to you.  Please get your house in order and see if you can come to Africa.  I'm not saying to come to Gambia or, you know, I love Gambia.  I really, really do.  But I'm saying to you there are so many, you know, houses in this beautiful mansion called Africa to choose from.  I'm in Gambia.  I'd say, you know, come here if you like.  The charm, the people, the sun, the sand, and all the beautiful things that go with it.  But, you know, you can also explore so many other parts of Africa.  So please do.  Please, you know, try and make some plans to get out. ",
