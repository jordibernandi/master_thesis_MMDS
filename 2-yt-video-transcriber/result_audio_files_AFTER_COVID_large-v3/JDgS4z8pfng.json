So there's no museum here, there's nothing really, I mean, obviously, your idea of something of photogenic value, something that's valuable to you photogenically, you may want to think this is a nice sign.  may not be what I would consider something of photogenic value.  However, if it's important to you and you want to take a picture of it, that's fine.  But on the other hand, if you want to just be a little tourist and just enjoy some good Air Force stuff and see some air power, the Air Power Museum is actually on the other side of the installation.
