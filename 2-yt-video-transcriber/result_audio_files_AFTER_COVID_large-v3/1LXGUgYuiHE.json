How many people have passed away?  How many people have died as of this moment?  You could multiply that by a factor of many, many, many.  So when you say that I wasn't prepared, I was the first one to do the ban.  Now other countries are following what I did.  But the media doesn't acknowledge that.  They know it's true.
