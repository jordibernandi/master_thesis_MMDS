            "text": "good morning everybody.  god just gave me a word this morning 2020 regardless man of what is going on is a year to celebrate and to just be grateful to god for everything that he's gonna do.  you see here on the money it says in God we trust and I know that's flipped for some of you guys but it says in God we trust.  I trust God for my future.  I trust God for my family.  I trust that God is going to take care of me.  I trust that God is going to cover me.  I trust that God is going to protect me.  I trust that God is going to look out for me.  I trust that God will never leave me nor forsake me.  I trust that God has got me.  It's God that wakes me up in the morning.  It's God that puts breath in my lungs.  It's God who allows my eyes to see and my ears to hear.  It's God and God I trust.  I trust him in 1999.  I trust him in the year 2000.  I trust him in 2020.  I trust him in 2021.  No matter what comes, no matter what the news says, no matter who the president is, in God, in God, in God, in God we trust.  All right, so this is the word trust.  that the Lord gave me and it will change your perspective on everything.  Number one, we're literally living in a Bible story.  I've showed you guys many times about Isaiah 45 and King Cyrus, but God has just revealed something else to me early this morning when I was studying in the Bible and I said, my goodness, it just, it blew my mind.  If people could really realize, you know, the Pope just sat there and said, same sex marriage and all that kind of stuff is okay.  We're literally living in the end times.  But guess what?  Do not be discouraged.  Now, if you've been following me since about 2014, 2015, when I was in the military, one of the words God gave me about the Donald Trump presidency was this.  If they build it in this season, I will bless it.  If they build it in this season, I will bless it.  And many of us have been building and God has been blessing.  And I want to let you know, it's not too late for you to start building something for the kingdom, for the glory of God.  And then two or three days ago, the Lord told me the time is now.  now for some of you that are watching this video that's gonna mean a lot of different things.  the time is now for you to get right.  the time is now for you to start looking for your next blessing.  the time is now for you to look for promotion.  the time is now for you to cut some people off.  the time is now for you to push for.  the time is now for For you to write the book.  The time is now for you to make the commitment.  The time is now for you to get serious about your relationship with God.  The time is now for you to go back to church.  The time is now for you to worship by your bedside.  The time is now for you to open up the Bible.  The time is now for you to forgive some people.  The time is now for you to make peace with some people.  The time is now.  now but the word that God gave me this morning that I'm so excited about he said going into 2021 everything that the enemy said you couldn't have.  I'm about to give it to my people.  there's some of you that you have wrote yourself off.  you think oh man I'm never gonna be blessed.  I'm never gonna have this.  I'm never gonna be able to do that.  I'm never gonna be able to overcome.  I'm never going to be able to beat this giant.  I'm never going to be able to experience this.  I'm never going to get to travel.  I'm never going to have a relationship.  I'm never going to have a marriage.  I'm never going to have no friends.  And the Lord says, that is not so.  Everything that the enemy has been telling you that you can't have, I'm about to give it to you just to show you who I am for my glory so you can have a testimony.  And the other day, the Lord whispered, now some of you need to get this.  Some of you need to get this.  And it's not no prosperity preaching.  He said, the wealth.  of the wicked is laid up for the righteous.  I'm going to tell you exactly what God is about to do in 2021.  You guys know I don't agree with all these doomsday preachers that are prophesying.  it's the end of the world.  Yes, I believe Donald Trump's going to win again.  And yes, I believe some people are going to protest and all of that stuff, but that's something that they can contain.  That's something that they can handle.  If you know anything about the military, they could deal with that.  So this is what the Lord is showing me.  He's going to give wealth all right, to people that can handle it.  Everybody can't handle that kind of blessing.  He's going to give a blessing to be a blessing.  He's about to unlock the wealth of the world.  All right.  And he's going to.  it's going to be like a transfer.  All right.  And he's going to put some money in some people's bank accounts.  He's going to put some money in some people's hands so they can go out and make a difference.  He said, I'm raising up difference makers.  He's not giving you money so you can sit there and buy a boat.  He's not giving you money so you can sit there and live.  you know this pretty laid-back life.  he's gonna give some money to some people that are gonna feed the homeless.  there's gonna be some people that open up some kitchens.  there's gonna be some people that open up some schools.  there's gonna be some people that open up some community centers and we're gonna literally see the kingdom of God on this earth making a difference.  not these little churches where you got churches on every block in every corner but there's nothing changing in the community.  he said I'm raising up difference makers.  they're gonna make a difference in the community.  They're going to make a difference in the neighborhood.  There's going to be people that come around and they're going to find their position.  Okay.  They're going to, because a lot of times we go to church and it's just about the pastor.  It's just about the pastor.  But what God is about to do going into 2021 is people are going to see where they fit in.  They're going to find their tribe and they're going to find their spot where they seem to just kind of flow.  And you've tried a lot of other things and you've tried a lot of other places, but it didn't flow.  God made you unique.  God made you wonderful.  God made you with specific talents and abilities and everybody doesn't need to be behind the microphone to make a difference in the kingdom.  And so what God is showing me, there's going to be kingdom resources that are unlocked.  He's going to give it to people that can manage it.  He's going to give it to people who can oversee and see what's going on.  where people need to be placed and where people need to go.  And then there's just going to be a flow.  There's going to be an outbreak of the greatest revival that we've ever seen.  It's not going to just be preaching behind the mic.  It's not just going to be signs, wonders, and miracles.  It's going to be practical things.  It's going to be loving your neighbor.  It's going to be out in the community, making a difference.  There's going to be millions of pounds of food being given out.  We're where people have dirty clothes and nowhere to wash them and the church is going to wash them.  we're going to send people out who are going to visit the widows going to visit the elderly woman going to take care of the orphan children.  there's going to be men's shelters and women's shelters and people are going to break free from drug addiction.  god says in 2021 he's unlocking kingdom finances for his children so that they can do the work of god.  they will be difference makers.  some of you are going to be the difference between people going to heaven or hell because of your obedience.  but he says look i don't need no watered down people i don't want no gummy bear christianity.  i want people that are going to preach the truth.  stand for the truth.  you know we're living in bible times right now.  politics is what made daniel get thrown in the lines.  then politics is what made shadrach meshach and abednego get thrown in the fire.  he says i'm looking for somebody with the spirit of elijah the spirit of elisha who will stand against jezebel.  they're not going to compromise for the money.  look at this.  it says in god we trust i don't have to water down the gospel message because i want the money.  i don't have to water down the uh.  gospel message and give you a business friendly jesus Because I don't want to lose the tides and offerings.  In God I trust.  God is the source of my resources.  I can preach it how he told me to preach it.  I can teach it how he told me to teach it.  I can say it how he told me to say it.  And I don't got to water it down because of people's feelings.  Because in God I trust.  God is the one that gives promotion.  God is the one that gives me breath in my body.  God is the one that gives me a job.  God is the one that opens doors.  God is the one that will lead me to the spouse that he has for me.  God is the one that will lead me to the promised land.  So I don't have to be bound to people's opinions.  It's not in this brother I trust, this sister I trust.  In God, in God, in Jesus Christ, that's the one that I trust.  And when I truly trust him, I can move in no fear.  When I truly trust him, I can step out and walk in water.  When I truly trust him, I don't have to bow.  down and I can be thrown in the lion's den around the lions and not be afraid.  when I truly trust him I can walk out and face Goliath and stop avoiding it and stop not confronting it.  I can confront the Giants in my life and say I'm gonna slay him because in God I trust not man and God not in myself but in God.  when I truly trust them I can take a stand even though the whole world is bowing down to the gold statue of the LGBTQ.  why?  because nine in man not in my job.  in God I trust.  not in money.  no in God I trust.  not in family.  no in God I trust there's too many people that are watering it down because they're so worried about provision.  they don't want to say the wrong thing.  they don't want to offend anybody because they're worried about provision God is going to provide to those that trust him because he's raising up the difference makers.  So I'm going to end this video and I'm going to string together every prophetic word that God has given me over the last couple of years.  Number one, if they build it in this season, I'm going to bless it.  Then he told me the time is now.  Recently, the time is now.  Then he told me everything that the enemy has been telling you, me and you, that we can't have.  He's going to give it to us.  He's going to lead us to the green pastures.  He's going to prepare a table before us in the presence of our enemies and in the presence of the people who said you couldn't overcome and the presence of the people who said you would never change and the presence of the people that said you wouldn't make it.  He's preparing a table for you.  Then he told me the wealth of the wicked is laid up for the righteous.  I'm going to give wealth to difference makers so they can bless my people, so they can make a difference in the community, so they can be a reflection of me.  because it takes money to feed the homeless.  Jesus had a treasurer and it was Judas.  It takes money to advance the kingdom.  Bottom line, people get funny when you talk about money, but the Bible talks about money a whole lot.  It says what you sow, you will reap.  God is going to give it to people that he can trust.  Everybody cannot handle that blessing because they're going to misuse it.  And they're going to misrepresent God when he gives it to them.  And the last thing, 2020 is a year to celebrate.  Personally, 2020 has been one of the best years of my life.  And I'm used to that happening.  When I went to South Korea, I thought that was one of the worst years of my life, but it ended up being one of the best years of my life.  When you have a kingdom perspective, When you're not looking at this world through the lens of, you know, what the world has got going on, I promise you this, 2020 has been one of the best years of my whole life.  But your perspective and your mentality has to change.  If you allow God to open your eyes and show you that he's still in control, you have nothing to fear.  You have nothing to be afraid of.  You have nothing to worry about.  God has never, ever lost control, my brothers and sisters.  So he told me to tell you.  2020 is a year to celebrate.  I don't care what everybody else is saying.  They taking on the mind of CNN.  They taking on the mind of Fox News.  Let me tell you, I feel this in the spirit strong.  God is about to bring the backsliders home.  You've been running from God.  You haven't been listening.  You have not been obeying.  God called you.  He chose you.  You know, before you was in your mother's womb, he had a plan for you.  And in 2021, he's calling some of you back Because we are about to see the greatest revival.  We're going to see an outpouring of finances to fund this kingdom movement.  But we are going to see something, and it's not to say anything bad about the past, okay?  The past was a good foundation.  The past was appropriate for the time.  But God is about to do a new thing.  I'm telling you, people are going to invade Hollywood.  They're going to invade the music industry.  They're going to be put in positions of influence.  And guess what?  Everything that Brother Marcus is telling you, God is already doing it in my life.  I'm talking to NBA players, NFL players, people in the music industry.  God is raising up some people.  But here's the thing.  Here's the requirement.  You need to live a holy life.  You need to be bold.  Remember what I said.  Think about this.  In God, in God we trust.  In God, you need to get that in your spirit right now and I'm going to end this video.  In God we trust.  No matter what's going on in the world, in God I trust.  No matter what my bank account looks like, in God I trust.  No matter who's supporting me, who's being there for me, in God I trust.  No matter what my past look like, in God I trust.  No matter what the devil is talking about, in God I trust.  No matter what 2021 or 2020 is looking like, In God I trust.  No matter what they talking about with the coronavirus, in God I trust.  No matter what my church is doing, in God I trust.  No matter what my family is doing, in God I trust.  If I get divorced, in God I trust.  If I get thrown in the lion's den, in God I trust.  If I gotta face a battle, a Goliath that's bigger than me, in God I trust.  If everybody leaves me and forsakes me, in God I trust.  If I look at my bank account and it's looking funny, in God I trust.  If my car break down, in God I trust.  If I feel fear, if I feel anxiety, in God I trust.  If he called me to walk out in the water, in God I trust.  If I get betrayed and thrown in the pit like Joseph, in God I trust.  If I find myself in a strange land like the children of Israel, in God I trust.  If I've got Pharaoh's army chasing after me, in God I trust.  Get that in your spirit.  You need to be saying that everywhere you go, everywhere you drive, everything that you're looking at.  In God I trust.  I declare it no matter what it looks like.  In God I trust.  And say it till you believe it.  And when you really start believing that, you're going to look at 2020 and you're going to say, man, I see what God is doing.  and it's amazing.  i see what god is doing and i want to celebrate.  i see what god is doing and it just makes me want to shout because the kingdom is rising up.  i really want to show you guys what god showed me in the bible man.  it blew my mind but i'm gonna tell you this i've been saying i will share this with you daniel was thrown in the lion's den because of politics.  They went to the king and they got some legislation passed.  Same thing with Shavuot, Meshach, and Abednego.  They went to the king and they got some legislation passed.  And there's people in America that are doing that, but it gets so deep, but I don't want to jump the gun.  I'm going to study this thing.  I'm going to develop it, but I'm going to tell you what, you better get right with God.  Because that's the only way you're going to make it.  Love you guys.  Be blessed.  Feel free to share this video.  If you've got a prayer request, put it in the comments.  If you haven't listened to Heavenly Places, go listen.  It's still trending on Apple Music.

You're calling them out, Father, to be part of the kingdom, to be used by the kingdom, not to be a spectator, but to participate, Father.  You're going to open doors for them.  You're going to make a way for them, Lord.  You said, excuse me, we're the head and not the tail, Father.  Help us to walk in that boldness.  Help us to walk in that revelation.
