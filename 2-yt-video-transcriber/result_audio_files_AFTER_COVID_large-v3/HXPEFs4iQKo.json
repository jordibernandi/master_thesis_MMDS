These people, most of the people here behind me have less than a year left to go.  And they're getting paid to do work release, although the government is still taking most of it.  However, I want to say a very special thank you and shout out to Live and Direct On The Air.  go to live and direct on the air on youtube and live and direct on the air.com.  my boy avi has been getting people that are illegally locked up out of prison.  he's done it once.  he's continued to do it.  we've got more in the future.  we've got some big name interviews coming up so somebody that's really doing great work is avi.  live and direct on the air.com and live and direct on the air on youtube.  go give him a like share and subscribe because he's doing what the the people The judges should be doing.  He's doing what the lawyers should be doing, what these nonprofits are doing.  He's doing it by himself.  So Avi, live and direct on the air.com and YouTube, live and direct on the air.  He's doing God's work right now.  We need you guys to share, like, and subscribe to him because we have so many people that are locked up that we need to get them out because most of them are there for... things that they didn't do.  And most of these people here, according to Mr.  America and what I've found, these people are nonviolent offenders here.  So most of these people, no victim, no crime, they shouldn't even be locked up.  But they're here slaving away for the government.  Slavery wasn't abolished.  They just changed around a little bit.  See if they respect our rights.  Live and direct on the air.com.  Live and direct on the air on YouTube.  See if they'll give it to us.  We'll check in as a visitor, see the procedures for treating the inmates.  Yep.  Hey, how are you?  I'd like to do a public records request about the procedures here. ",
