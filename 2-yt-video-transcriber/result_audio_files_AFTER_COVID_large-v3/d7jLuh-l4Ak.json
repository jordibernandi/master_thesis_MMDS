But the simple text of the speech has been missed.  What President Trump did at Mount Rushmore was to give the nation a history lesson, a much needed history lesson about the fact that the men carved into the mountain behind him were not, as a CNN presenter had said earlier that day, just slavers.  that the reputation, the life, the legacy of George Washington, of Thomas Jefferson, and of Abraham Lincoln, just for starters, is not some horrible history, which has to be attacked and derided, but rather a subject of great pride for the American people, the American Republic.  And, and that simple fact that just reiteration of the stories of these men and then of President Roosevelt, the first President Roosevelt was was ignored, almost totally ignored by the media.  The Washington Post said that it's no secret anymore.  What this is is about white supremacy.  One of the candidates possibly going to be chosen as his running mate for vice president of Joe Biden said that Trump had spent the entire speech talking about what she called dead traitors.  She said he talked about Confederates the whole speech.  He'd done no such thing.  And so this is.  this is the thing.  It's not just the details that are being missed.  The president gives an incredibly important speech on the eve of one of the most important days, the most important day, the founding day in the American calendar.  And it's just completely ignored.

            "text": "Well, this is a very, very interesting story that's been happening for a long time, but it's reached a fever pitch clearly in the Trump presidency.  It seems to have been the case that rather than just sort of, you know, opposing the sort of woke and revisionist history types, Trump has in some ways actually managed to make these people yell louder and in larger numbers.  But what I'm describing is a very interesting thing that's happened throughout our lifetimes, which is a basic unweaving of the fabric of the root of American society.  That is everything to do with the founding story.  Instead of, for instance, celebrating Christopher Columbus, for discovering America to use the terrible term.  Everything about Columbus is meant to be embarrassing, as if it would have been better for everyone if Columbus had sailed in the wrong direction.  And then we get to the founding of the Republic.  Now, today, the New York Times has won a Pulitzer for an ongoing project started last year, which shifts the date of the founding of America to one half centuries earlier and says the founding of the Republic.  actually basically we just talk about the founding of America from the time that the first slaves are brought in.  from Africa.  So that fundamentally alters the story.  Then you have the assault on the founding fathers.  And that isn't.  that isn't a sort of academic debate anymore.  I mean, we've seen people pulling down and defacing the statues of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson and others.  And again, one of the likely candidates for vice president for the Democratic Party on the on the Biden ticket asked a couple of days ago whether statutes of George Washington should come down or not.  duck to the question.  So the founding fathers are controversial.  And then we have a poll that just came out a couple of weeks ago that shows 70 percent, 70 percent of self-identified liberals believe the American Constitution should be rewritten.  So my suggestion is.  If the founding fathers are just slavers, it would be better if Columbus had never found America and slavery is the only story of America and white supremacy and the Constitution should be what exactly is left.  And that's the question that Donald Trump, whatever you think of him, and God knows there are criticisms to make, whatever you think of him, what he did Mount Rushmore on Friday was to say, we have a story.  It's a unifying story.  It's a story that has encompassed people of every race and background by now.  I mean, the list of people, great Americans who the president reeled off, including Martin Luther King, including, you know, the great moral figures, great writers, great sportsmen.  He mentioned, you know, Louis Armstrong, you know, and as he said.  the this list the great people could only have been produced by America.  is he?  what he's trying to do?  there is to give a unifying story back to America because what is being offered to Americans otherwise is everything in your history is rotten.  everything is for the bad better that we've never started this thing.  so I think yes it's a very important thing that the president is doing and as I say in the piece this week's spectator probably about the best chance he has of re-election is if his enemies his opponents continue not just to oppose him but to oppose everything in the founding of the republic onwards.

            "text": "Well, I don't know about that.  I think that... The relatively modern desire to think ill of your country, to think badly of your forebears and to judge yourself in a worse light than anyone else is a really very strange, very modern perversion.  It's historically very unusual.  It's a modern perversion taught from the academy outwards, which says to be sort of smart.  You know, to be a sort of clever person, you must basically hate everything about your own origins, hate everything about your own society and and rather over admire every other society.  That's a that's a pretty unusual thing.  And by the way, even in the modern age, it's characterized only in the modern West and primarily in English speaking countries.  It's a modern Australian, American, Canadian, British problem primarily.  And I think this is a sort of.  this is a period we're going through.  It'll it'll finish or at least come to less of a less prominence because it's such an unnatural position to hold.  I think that most Americans think that America is a pretty good place.  Of course, it has its faults.  But as Jean Kirkpatrick famously said in the Vietnam era, nobody doubted that America could improve.  But to improve, it had to survive.  And it's the same with Britain.  I mean, we do have people now who think that, you know, the absolutely smart thing to be is to sort of pretend you're an expert on the colonial period, say that we only did bad things and look smart at parties.  Actually, these people who are currently telling everyone else to read more tend, in my experience, to know less than almost anybody.  Most of the British public, like the American public, have a very important instinct, which is All people in history, all people, including our own history, have made mistakes and we can judge them.  But by and large, if you look at the ledger historically, we've been a force for good more than we have a force for ill.  And the American people know that.  they know that the era of the American hegemony.  has been better than it would have been if it had been an era of Chinese hegemony or North Korean hegemony or any other.  And it's the same with the British.  You know, we know that we've had a complex history like everyone else.  But we also know that, broadly speaking, we've been a force for good in the world or at least more of a force for good than for ill.  That's a perfectly reasonable insight.  It's totally justifiable.  There's no reason to feel ashamed of it.  And I think that the people who think that the sort of smarty pants thing to do is to be a sort of self lover should just realize that they are a sort of weird, weird masochist in an international marketplace of very willing and eager sadists.

And again, I think it's been missed by the mainstream media, actually.  But there's a real fury that they would challenge the Commonwealth, which has been the Queen's life work.

By having a prince and princess lecturing us on privilege.  I can never quite get that one out of my head.  But the main thing is, yeah, look, a new ethic has been arriving.  It's what I write about in The Madness of Crowds.  A new ethic has been arriving for some time.  Opportunistic people, slightly cowardly people and a lot of others are at the moment shifting and trying to make everyone else shift to take account of this change and to try to make sure they're on the right side of it.  I strongly urge people not to do this.  I strongly urge people in countries like Britain and America not to hate on their history and be solely judgmental of their forebears.  I strongly urge people not to play the privilege game.  Strongly urge people not to play the race-baiting, race hierarchy, every race against each other game.  Strongly urge against that and much more.  And it's perfectly possible to say, you know what?  Everything you're inviting us to do will lead us to much worse hells than we've been through in the past.  even So don't play these games.  work out what they are in advance of playing them and say, you know, I listen to Prince Harry and and and his wife and I don't think they know what they're talking about and I don't think I particularly want to hear from them.  and We have plenty of very good examples of how people should behave and how people might think and act in their lives better.  And it's a rather uncomfortable but true thing.  that it happens that Prince Harry's grandmother is about the best example we've got going certainly in Britain at the moment, or perhaps ever, of how a life of actual service should be led of how real devotion to country and to improving people's lives can be led.  And it's not in lecturing people.  And it's not in berating people.  And it's not in playing weird zero sum games of history.  but in showing people how to feel a very reasonable and deserved pride in things that they should feel pride in.  And so, as I say, I think there's a very strange thing happening in our era, but it's perfectly possible for people to say, I'm opting out of it.  I do, and I strongly urge other people to do the same. ",
