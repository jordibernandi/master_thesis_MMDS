            "text": "Hi, I'm Dr.  Dave Chanda.  Welcome back to Dave versus the MSM.  The title of today's presentation is President Trump's speech, the State of the Union speech, versus Nancy Pelosi, the deep state puppet, her temper tantrum.  Before we start on that, a couple of house cleaning chores.  Number one, I hope you'll join us for our radio show every Sunday.  It's free.  2 to 5 Eastern.  Great guests, great analysis.  This week will be no different.  You stream it live, free, at DaveJanda.com.  Go to DaveJanda.com, right toward the top, listen live, hit that.  It'll take you to the Wham Talk 1600 streaming site.  Hit play and you're on board.  Great guest this week.  We're going to talk about what happened in Iowa with an IT expert extraordinaire about that goat rodeo.  Isn't it interesting?  The Sanders crowd, the Mayor Pete, let's just call him Mayor Cheat.  after when you get into the situation of what really happened in Iowa with that app.  Mayor Pete happened to have a financial interest in.  Yeah, I know.  Chris Matthews isn't talking about it.  CNN isn't talking about it.  But we will.  These are the same people that can't count 200,000 votes that want to continue to run this country and health care and the economy.  Right.  Sorry.  We're going to go into it in depth.  So I hope you'll join us on Sunday.  In addition to this YouTube channel, because of the issues I have outlined before, we have set up a channel at dailymotion.com forward slash Operation Freedom, where we're putting up many of the interviews we have here up there, but we're also going to be putting some other content there that we know would be censored here on this platform.  That's what it has come to.  Now, yesterday we uploaded an interview I did on the radio show with Dave from the X22 Report.  We also uploaded it on dailymotion.com because we don't know how long it's going to last on this platform.  In addition, on Monday, we recently did an interview on our Insider Insight subscription series with Charles Woods, the father of Ty Woods.  This is an interview you need to hear and see.  This is information the fake media will never touch.  The last time we did an interview that involved Charles, it was taken down.  So we're uploading it on this channel, but also uploading it full length on dailymotion.com forward slash Operation Freedom.  We hope you'll join us there.  It will be there.  They don't have the censorship issues.  that appears to be the situation on this platform.  Now, President Trump's State of the Union speech.  When you boil it all down, he painted a mosaic, if you will, a portrait of our country and what makes our country great, the people of this country.  And as he spoke about the economic achievements over the past three years, notice the word he used, we did this.  We.  Because you can cut regulations all you want, but if folks like you and me are not out on the streets doing our jobs, there is no economy.  Which is why he used the word we.  But he highlighted what makes our country great across the board.  And he outlined several individuals.  And look at who he brought forward to highlight what really makes America great.  A woman who was giving her life to helping others in foreign countries.  President Trump had her parents there because she could not attend because she was murdered there.  by the terrorist al-Baghdadi who recently met his own demise at the hands of our government.  A woman who was giving her life to help others, who was then captured by al-Baghdadi, serially raped by Baghdadi, and then murdered.  He honored, President Trump honored her in that speech and her parents.  He also brought forward a little girl who was born at 21 weeks, 21 weeks.  Remember this governor from Northam wants to do abortions after the child's even brought through the birth canal.  A little 21 month old girl and her mom who has cared for her was highlighted about the importance of life, the importance of children.  A little girl was also highlighted who received a scholarship for her academic future.  The future of this country.  A young boy who is, again, the future of our country, who dreams of exploring space.  And the young boy's grandfather, who's an American hero, who was one of the original Tuskegee Airmen, who was 100 years of age.  who earlier that day President Trump promoted to Brigadier General.  A woman and her son whose husband could not be there that night because he had been killed in a foreign land serving for our country.  He died at the hands of the butcher, Soleimani, who recently was wiped off the face of the earth.  As I've outlined before, Soleimani just did not wear the hat of the head of the Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps out of Iran, but he wore the hat of the head of terror operations for the deep state.  He is no longer.  He highlighted a man who changed his life around after he had served in the military, suffered post-traumatic stress syndrome, and then became a drug addict.  Changed his life around and became a businessman and has become successful.  He highlighted a family who in front of our very eyes was reunited, the dad who had been serving overseas in the Middle East, and the little boy and the little girl being reunited with their dad.  And he highlighted a radio icon who has touched millions, some in a positive light, some, well, maybe they see it as a negative light.  But he opened the eyes of a lot of different people over the last 30 to 40 years.  Rush Limbaugh.  If it were not for Rush Limbaugh, the truth is that AM radio would probably have died.  And what also would have died was potentially our country.  There are many things I disagree with Rush Limbaugh on.  Over the years, he kept painting this right-left narrative and those of us that were painting an up-down narrative, up being freedom and down being oppression, and that there was a deep state in a globalist syndicate.  For many years, he discounted.  In the past year and a half, I would say, he has embraced that, that many of us had been speaking about years before.  But he is an icon.  And without him, talk radio would not exist, and I believe our freedoms would be drastically diminished.  And what was the reaction to that portrait, that mosaic, that President Trump created?  Well, at the end you saw it.  It's what's been described as the rip heard around the world, what Nancy Pelosi did.  This was reported in Zero Hedge.  Pelosi tears up Trump's State of the Union speech after handshake snub.  Oh, by the way, you'll notice President Trump did not shake Vice President Pence's hand either that night.  He handed Pelosi his speech, he handed Pence his speech, and he got down to business.  This is what was said, Pelosi, as expected, after the handshake thing, issue, snubbed Trump right back, introducing him only as, quote, the President of the United States, end quote, whereas traditionally the speaker has used the language, quote, I have the high privilege and distinct honor of presenting to you the President of the United States, end quote.  And during the entire speech, it looked as though she was peering at a menu and was getting mad that, why hasn't the waiter come to take my drink order yet?  She was mumbling and muttering to herself.  And then she was bringing the papers to the side and then bringing them back up.  And I understand from someone who was there, who I spoke to that night, and also it has been since reported, she was actually making little preliminary tears.  So that when she pulled her stunt, her temper tantrum at the end where she tore, she wanted to make sure they actually tore so that they tore rather than just have her wailing on the papers without them tearing.  From the very beginning, this was what she was going to do.  This was not an extemporaneous act of, no.  It was premeditated.  Zero doubt.  And then when asked afterwards, why did you tear up the speech?  She responded, quote, because it was the courteous thing to do.  It was the courteous thing to do considering the alternative, end quote.  Many people have stated that Donald Trump has overstated the opposition he has been against.  That these opposition is truly not vile, truly that it's all him.  in living color, in front of hundreds of millions of individuals.  It was on display that night.  He painted a portrait and a mosaic of what makes our country great, the people.  And then Nancy Pelosi, who was representing the deep state, showed you what they believed.  about our country and its people, that we should be ripped to shreds.  Many people found it surprising.  she did that.  Really?  Because she and the other deep state puppets have been ripping the Constitution to shreds in that same chamber for years, if not decades.  It was just put on display.  I have a prediction.  That stunt she pulled is going to lead to a backlash that she and the deep state never could have anticipated.  They should have, but they didn't.  And they didn't because they don't know the heart and soul of our country and the people that make up our country, you and me and the other 320 million people.  It's pride in our country.  It's pride in our accomplishments.  It's pride in our past.  And it's pride in what we're going to do in the future of making a positive difference for the world.  Donald Trump, because of what was done that night by Pelosi and what he said in his speech.  will win a landslide reelection in November.  And the House will flip, hopefully, back to not just the Republicans.  No.  We want freedom-loving, non-globalist individuals elected.  And right now, there's nobody that has a D after their name that fit that bill.  And there are many R's that don't fit that bill that have an R after their name.  A good example of that is Mitt Romney.  It's time.  It's time that we all stand up and network the facts to anyone and everyone you know.  about those that support freedom, and that those that oppose freedom and work for the deep state.  I hope you'll join us this Sunday, 2 to 5 Eastern.  The show is free, Operation Freedom.  Go to DaveJanda.com and stream it.  I hope you'll join us at DaveJanda.com.
