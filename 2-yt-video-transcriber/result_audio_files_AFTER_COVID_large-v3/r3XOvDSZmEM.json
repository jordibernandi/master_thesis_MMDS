And until the moment the Wright brothers made airplanes fly, they were leading scientists saying it would never happen, literally the week before it happened.  So, I mean, we're not going to prove that some new technology is going to come about to the satisfaction of skeptics.  But one thing I do want to clarify, though, is my best... guess of how the future will turn out.  is not that all humans will be annihilated and will not exist any further.  And I think that there can be superhuman superminds that are far beyond anything we can conceive.  And there can also be AIs of roughly human-level intelligence that exist in the human world and that help people.  So the way I conceive the opportunities that will be open to humans in the future is they're just very rich and diverse.  I mean, one opportunity, you can plug your brain into the superhuman mind matrix and in effect become part of some transhuman god mind, thus losing yourself and individuality and humanity.  But I'm sorry.  Let me finish, because we keep getting hung up on this point.  But I think there will also be an opportunity to continue living a human life in much the same form as now, except with a whole AI-driven infrastructure that will 3D print any physical object that you want, that will cure any disease that you may get, and that will regulate things so that people don't blow each other up and such.

So, I mean, if there's something extreme happening, then the more intelligent being overlooking the situation will intervene, because we don't care that much about whether one squirrel lives or dies, but we do want that species and population to continue, right?

But the thing about the angels was that they had nothing to do with the moral or spiritual life of human beings.  They were simply a higher class of entities with more direct access to the Godhead.
