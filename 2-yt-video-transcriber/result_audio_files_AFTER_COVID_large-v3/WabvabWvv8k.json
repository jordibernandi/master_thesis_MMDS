Senator Harris says she's proud of her record as a prosecutor and that she'll be a prosecutor president, but I'm deeply concerned about this record.  There are too many examples to cite, but she put over 1,500 people in jail for marijuana violations and then laughed about it when she was asked if she ever smoked marijuana.  She blocked evidence that would have freed an innocent man from death row until the courts forced her to do so.  She kept people in prison beyond their sentences to use them as cheap labor for the state of California.  And she fought to keep cash bail system in place that impacts poor people in the worst kind of way. ",
