That as people who are much smarter than me have explored and learned and looked at the fossil record, that... The life forms now share common ancestors, right?  We can look at the phylogenetic tree of life and see, and that is where we're looking at evolution.  And we can kind of trace that back to the proto-creatures that first inhabited this place.  And those proto-creatures weren't always here.  And so we call the beginning, the spot from not a living thing to a living thing, abiogenesis.  But in the same way, you know, when we talk about something like dark matter, we're talking about what we have understood, but we're not saying that we know everything about it.  We're saying this is to the best of our knowledge what we've been able to come up with and show, you know, definitively, hey, here's how we got from A to B to C. You can check my work.  So I want to take that, that whole thing around abiogenesis, and I want to set that on the shelf for a second.  Because I gave you a decent rundown of something that you can check out yourself.  It's not just my claim.  And say, okay, there's that.  Now let's look at your competing hypothesis.  What do you have?  that shows your claim about a God creating all life?
