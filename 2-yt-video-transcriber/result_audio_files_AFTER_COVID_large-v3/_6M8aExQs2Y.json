Aren't they racist though?  Aren't you calling the cops on a black man?  She's calling the racist police on my black security officer.  Yes, vote, vote, vote.  It's Biden's day.  Sir, can I ask you a real question?  Florida blue.  Can I ask you a real question?  Vote, vote.  Can you stop screaming?  Miami-Dade, Broward County, Hillsborough County.  Can I ask you a real question?  We're voting.  We're flipping.  We are flipping Florida.  Republicans are leading early voting.  We stayed home 2016 from listening to polls.  Not this year.  Republicans are leading in early voting.  Hi guys, go to patreon.com slash Caitlin.  Put your phone back up.  Okay, she will record it.  You will go to patreon.com slash Caitlin Bennett to keep you coming out here.  Yes, the election is just in a few days, but the work does not stop there.  They are going to go hard with censorship.  They're going to go hard with trying to stop our second amendment.  We have to be activists and be able to make sure that after Trump, after these next four years, We're still spreading his message and spreading the message.  Please don't touch me.  Social distancing.  Social distancing.  Look at her.  Look at that cute little muffin top she's got.  She just purposely went by and touched me.  I got to get tested.  What do you guys think?  Why are you coming by me?  I don't want to talk to you.  Why did you run into me on purpose?  You were social distancing.  Why did you run into me on purpose?  It's six feet, so back up.  Don't touch me.  Get the out of here.  Stop, stop.  Go, go, go.  You put your hands on her, step back.  No, they're not.  For some context, she went through my security, went around them to push into me over there, which we have on camera, I think.  And then when I confront her about why she's being aggressive, she, again, gets aggressive.  Why can't Democrats control their anger?  You know why they're even out here?  It's all feelings for them.  It's all feelings.  They sit there and they preach the virus to you.  You have to wear a mask.  You can't see your family at church.  You can't go over there and have Thanksgiving with your family.  You have to do what they say.  But when it benefits them because they can't control their emotions, they act out.  They don't social distance.  They don't wear a mask.  They don't care.  They'll hurt you.  I don't know.  Take away from that what you want.  Hi, how are you?  Hi.  Why do you need security?  I'm sorry?  Why do you need security?  I'm not going to be on your program.  Oh, are you media?  Yeah.  Who are you with?  Well, I don't want to be on your program.  But you want people to be on your program.  I need security.  I think your camera just got it.  She was pushing me, putting her hands on me.  And there's a pandemic right now where we're supposed to be social distancing.  But yeah, no, you came up to me.  Hi, guys.  You can go to libertyhangout.org.  You can get this shirt right here.  Oh, come on.  Come on.  You want to film me?  Come on.  I just took a picture of you because I found it interesting.  you brought security.  That's all.  Yeah, yeah.  It's interesting that Republicans have to bring security to Joe Biden events.  That's really funny, isn't it?  Are you there to keep her in check?  Because she's quite aggressive.  I don't want to get these people from hurting her.  She put her hands on me.  They also have it on video that it was the exact opposite.  And I'm not speaking to you.  We're waiting for the police officer.  That's amazing.  Thank you so much for getting them.  Aren't they racist, though?  Aren't the cops, aren't we supposed to be defunding the police?  Okay, so now we're calling racist cops.  I have a black security.  No one's talking to you.  Let's bring up another topic.  Calling cops on black security.  Yeah, aren't you calling the cops on a black man?  I just want to point out they closed the border over there.  That's racist.  She's calling the racist police on my black security officer.  And I know he could pass for Hispanic.  I don't know if he is.  But hi, how are you?  So she has her phone out recording me.  Were you recording your friend assaulting me?  reporter, my friend, you and your bodyguards assaulting her.  Oh, really?  Did I see that footage?  Oh, yeah.  Can you put that up? ",

When I signed up to be a law enforcement officer, this is not what I wanted to deal with.  God, I've missed this so much.  Guys, I am having a freaking blast.  This is so fun.
