Once the birth that cursed the earth to Leavenworth has gone.  The tax you owe, Donnie.  Your last hoe, Donnie.  All the lies that we despise at last will end.  You're locked up, sucker.  I can just hear your butt.  Pucker.  Donnie, you're done.  We're free at last.  Pack up the clan and make it fast.  We never want to see your big fat ass again. ",
