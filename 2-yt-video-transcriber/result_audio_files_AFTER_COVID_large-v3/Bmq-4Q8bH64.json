The officer could be seen repeatedly punching the man in the head as the eyewitness recorded the encounter from across the street.  Initially, the LAPD said it considered this a minimal use of force, but after the video was seen, And after body-worn video from the officers was reviewed, the case was elevated.  Prosecutors began reviewing the evidence last week, and L.A.  County District Attorney Jackie Lacy tells us they filed the felony charge within days. ",
