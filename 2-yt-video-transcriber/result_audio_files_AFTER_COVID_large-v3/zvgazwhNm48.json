I'm going to link that video in the description and I highly encourage you to watch it after this video so you get a whole scope because today's video is actually going to be highlighting the opposite end of the spectrum.  i have wanted to do this video for so long but no one ever wants to come on my channel.  today we're actually talking with a young woman who transitioned at the age of 10 from male to female.  now look kids transitioning and detransitioning remains a highly contentious issue remains an issue that in my opinion is full of gray areas.  it's really not as black and white as people want to believe and as of recently the uk is actually moving to ban children transitioning.  This is coming off the heels of an unprecedented spike in children seeking out transitional surgeries and treatments, which has caused a ton of backlash.  And my intention with interviewing this happy teen transitioner is the same as it was with interviewing the detransitioner, right?  It's to help give you guys a full scope on exactly what is going on here and allowing you to make up your own minds.  So same disclaimer as I had when I interviewed Elle, please reserve any and all hate comments that you might send to this girl.  Keep in mind we are interviewing a teenager, a literal senior in high school.  And personally, I have a very maternal feeling over all the young trans people who come on my channel, as well as all the young detransitioners that come on my channel.  So definitely keep that in mind.  And without further ado, here is Emily's story. ",

I think that you're an important voice in this conversation, which like I said, both sides definitely need to be presented because you know, it's just a, it's a topic that is still developing, you know, and I definitely appreciate you coming on.

            "text": "Yes, of course.  So final thoughts.  I think it was really amazing to see someone who transitioned at a young age who was successful and happy.  I've always known these cases exist.  Obviously, you have people like Kim Petras, Josh Jennings, who, for all intents and purposes from the outside looking in, seem to be happy with their choice.  And I don't really foresee them being unhappy with it in the future.  However, as I discussed with Emily, I really don't feel like the positive cases necessarily negate the negative and vice versa.  And I also think that considering Emily started her transition technically eight years ago, it was actually a different time when it came to trans issues and how trans is treated in the medical field.  It was actually medicalized, which of course activists are trying to get rid of now.  So there actually was a better way to vet people who would benefit from transition.  Whereas now, the definition has become so expanded that there are, as we've discussed and as we've interviewed, a lot of people falling into that category that don't need to be there.  i mean eight years ago in terms of trans and lgbt.  discourse might as well have been a century ago and honestly there was just more precision with diagnosing people and kids specifically with gender dysphoria than there is now.  back then you actually needed to have gender dysphoria to be diagnosed as trans and given hormones and given surgery.  Now you don't, which is why around the time that Emily transitioned, you only had 77 trans kids seeking treatment.  at the UK's most popular gender clinic.  as of 2019 that number raised from 77 to 2,000 plus with 3,000 plus on the waiting list.  so something is clearly up and it's clearly the broadening of the definition of trans.  so I really do hold true to my convictions and my opinions that I previously had on children transitioning, but I obviously of course think that it was the right move for Emily just based on our conversation.  and so I wish her all the success and happiness in the world and I'm sure she's gonna get it.  she seems like an amazing young woman.
