What I was best known for in the New Age was called angel cards, and they were based on tarot.  Tarot scared me.  It had the devil on it.  It had pentagrams.  I didn't like any of those things.  So I created a deck of cards that didn't have any kind of evil symbolism, but still was used for divination.  After a while, I think I had about 25 different decks of cards for sale.  And I would give workshops around the world and on videos where I'd be demonstrating the cards or teaching other people how to use them.  You know, everyone has guardian angels.  I'm speaking as a lifelong clairvoyant.  I didn't think anything I was doing was wrong.  I hadn't read the whole Bible.  There's no one in the sky with a clipboard judging you.  That's all dumbed-down religion stuff.  that is not true.  I thought that Jesus approved of everything we did as long as we were happy and positive.  That's what we were told.  We were also told there was no such thing as sin. ",

But after hearing his talk, it pointed me to go to church, which ultimately pointed me to the Bible.  And when I got to reading Deuteronomy 18, 10 through 12, that's when I saw a list of things that I was doing.  Fortune telling, divination, mediumship, interpreting omens, and the passage says that God sees people who do those things as an abomination.  Not the actions, but the people.  I was blown away by reading this.  I thought before then I was, I know it sounds ridiculous, but I thought that I was helping God in the new age.  A lot of false teachers think they're helping God because we seem to be comforting people, making them happy.  We seem to be bringing healing to them, but it's all demonic and we are blind to that truth.  So when I read Deuteronomy 18, 10 through 12, that's when I finally realized that I was a absolute wretched sinner who'd been spreading lies, destructive lies that could send people to hell for 22 years in the new age that I'd been teaching.  And it just broke me.  And I just got on my knees and started crying Probably did for about three days.  I just kept saying to God, I didn't know, I didn't know, I'm so sorry.  I had no idea that I was defying you.  I had no idea that I was breaking your law, that I was sinning.  And I just kept saying, I don't know what I'm doing.
