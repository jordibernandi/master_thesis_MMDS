So why do you think many countries don't trust President Trump right now?  Look, this President has led the greatest response to COVID.  I've already walked through how well we're doing vis-a-vis the rest of the world.  Also worth noting,  U.S.,  we had the smallest economic contraction of any major Western country in the first half of the year.  Also want to note that in 2019, real median household income grew by more \u2013 this is last year alone \u2013 real median household income grew by more than all eight years of Obama-Biden.  And in 2019, so last year, real median household income for African Americans rose 8 percent, and that is more than double the gains of Obama-Biden in eight years.  So this President has led economically.  He's led on COVID.  And when you look at what he did just yesterday with these landmark peace agreements that haven't been done in a quarter of a century, but President Trump made it happen.  He is a great diplomat, a great peacemaker, and I think him being nominated for two Nobel Prizes says it all.  On September 3rd, you said the herd immunity so-called theory was something made up by the fanciful minds of the media.  That was never something that was ever considered here at the White House.  But last night, the President said that the country would eventually achieve herd mentality.  I believe he meant immunity, to explain how the virus would, quote, go away.  So did the White House shift its position about this in the past two weeks since you made those comments?  And what is the position about using it as a strategy?  Heart immunity has never been a strategy here at the White House.  The President last night was noting herd immunity is over a period of time, a country, a society can reach herd immunity.  It's a fact, it was not a strategy ever presented here at the White House.  And in fact, he went on in that very same exchange to say with the vaccine, this will go away very quickly.  Noting our strategy is to get a vaccine and we will do so at the fastest rate for a novel pathogen.  He doesn't agree with Dr.  Atlas's view that everyone should just catch it and then we'll move on.  That's not Dr.  Atlas's view.  Dr.  Atlas, I'm with him every day.  He's never proposed herd immunity as a strategy, nor has the president.  John. ",
