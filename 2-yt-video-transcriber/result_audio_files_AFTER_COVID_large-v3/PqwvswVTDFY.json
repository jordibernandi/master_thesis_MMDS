            "text": "Hello and welcome back to No BS.  Today we turn to talking about a very controversial and strange figure in the entertainment business.  I'm of course talking about Mia Khalifa.  Mia Khalifa is known for having some interesting acting abilities to say the least.  I'm going to have to tiptoe around this subject a little bit today, but for those of you who don't know, basically Mia has acted in some adult films.  She's done some very interesting performances on the internet and the.  That's just the beginning of the story, though.  Basically, she came out a few years back.  She started this career path, and she got a little famous at one point.  She became a meme because of her background and how she's from a certain area in the Middle East.  that's just not normally around this kind of behavior.  They're not really for any kind of sexuality or any kind of even just freedom for the women.  They're more conservative in these areas.  So the fact that Mia came from a place like that and a place that had a dominating religion that was against this stuff.  That was kind of her gimmick.  That was kind of what got her famous back in the day a few years ago because she was from this different background and she was doing these naughty movies.  And then from there, what happened later was, and what we're talking about today is, She eventually retired from that business and tried to spin off her career into something a little more, or let's say a little less revealing.  She tried to do sports commentary.  She went on a few interviews.  And basically, ever since she retired from that business, she's been trash talking it a lot too, which is pretty amazing.  I would say pretty unfair and messed up.  It was the reason that she got famous, and it was the reason that everyone knows her name.  Mia Khalifa is her adult actress name.  It's not even her real name, and she still uses that name, which is kind of interesting, and it shows how she got all her fame from there.  and in a new report and what we're talking about today is one of her former employers came out with an exposed video basically just breaking down why mia was wrong about everything.  she said she constantly complained about this business and she said a lot of things that are not true and they're proven to be false in this video we're about to go over so we're going to get to that soon.  we're going to talk more about this story.  go over that video and get into all this good stuff very soon but first Let's take a quick moment to check out our sponsor.

This comes from her former employer's Instagram page.  It's called This Is You Part Two, and basically it's exposing Mia for misleading people about her former career.  She said she only worked for a couple months when in fact she was at it for a couple years.  She also says she only made a small amount of money.  I believe she says she made $12,000 when in fact she made like over $100,000 and had a lot of benefits from this system too.  Not only did she make more money and get like perks like her house and utilities paid for, but in addition, all the... fame and stuff that she's getting now comes from this career.  So she got famous in these adult films and now she's trying to bash it and act like she's better than this, but it's just not true.  And she's also proven to be a liar.  So that's why we're going over today and trying to get more of this exposed out there.  So let's go and check it out. ",

            "text": "Mia Khalifa has decided to appear in another interview to further bash the adult industry.  Instead of going with someone that would come prepared with hard-hitting questions and actually get the truth out of her, she chose to interview with a guy known for content such as Making Bed vs.  Messy Bed and I Ate a Lube Sandwich and This Is What Happened.  In this interview, she continued her lies and manipulation tactics. ",

            "text": "So we'll get to some of those lies and tactics soon, but first let's talk about what they just said about the interview.  She did this interview with Anthony Padilla.  This guy used to be part of the Smosh team on YouTube.  They're a comedy channel, and now he has his own spinoff channel, which is fine, like whichever.  I've never really followed them.  I saw some Smosh comedy videos back in the day, but Yeah, it seems like Anthony's new spinoff channel is very cringe, as she just pointed out in this video.  And it's just kind of giving you a baseline, showing you that she's doing this interview, these low-ball, low-effort interviews to try and spread misinformation.  She's not trying to be challenged or try to get the truth out there.  She's just doing easy press circuits to kind of spread these lies that are about to be exposed. ",

Like she just has this new website with like lewd and nude photography sites.  believe it's similar to like an OnlyFans situation.  you know OnlyFans is a big craze.  right now.  girls post scandalous pictures on there.  sometimes they're just cute or sexy sometimes they're fully naked or whichever.  and the point is yeah Mia is still capitalizing off of her sexuality and her body and her nudes and it's just.
