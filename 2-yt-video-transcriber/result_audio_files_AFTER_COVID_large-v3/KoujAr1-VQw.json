            "text": "Some people are saying the rapture will happen in 2020, but could this be a deception that leads to the great falling away?  It's time to unlearn the lies.  Hey, welcome to UNLEARN.  My name is Lex, and I'd like to invite you to join us each week as we UNLEARN the lies and dig deeper into the truth of God's Word.  Now let's get started.  Paul gave an interesting statement about the coming of the Lord, and he warned us not to be deceived into thinking Christ will come before the great falling away.  And the Antichrist sits in the temple claiming to be God.  Now brethren, concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to him, we ask you not to be soon shaken in mind or troubled, either by spirit or by word or by letter, as if from us, as though the day of Christ had come.  Let no one deceive you by any means, for that day will not come unless the falling away comes first and the man of sin is revealed, the son of perdition, who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God or that is worshipped, so that he sits as God in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God.  Most rapture preachers say believers will be taken out of the earth before the tribulation.  This means believers won't see the antichrist come to power.  Nor will they have to worry about the mark of the beast.  But what if they're wrong?  I'm concerned that people are being led astray into believing they won't face tribulation.  And when the tribulation happens and they aren't raptured, will they remain in the faith?  Or will they fall away?  Could this be the great falling away that Paul warned about?  Remember the parable of the sower and the people who will fall away when tribulation comes?  But he who received the seed on stony places, this is he who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy.  Yet he has no root in himself, but endures only for a while.  For when tribulation or persecution arises because of the word, immediately he stumbles.  Why would believers fall away or stumble in their faith when tribulation comes?  This could easily happen for someone who put their faith in the rapture and is not expecting to face tribulation.  Those who believe Yeshua will rapture His people before the tribulation are not trusting in the word of God.  Listen to what Yeshua said about when He will gather His people.  Immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light.  The stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of heaven will be shaken.  Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.  And He will send His angels with the great sound of a trumpet.  and they will gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the  other.\".  He gathers his people after the tribulation, not before.  The pre-tribulation rapture is a dangerous deception being taught by false prophets who don't believe the word of God.  It's dangerous because when the tribulation begins and the rapture hasn't happened, many Christians will fall away.
