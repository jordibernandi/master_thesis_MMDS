            "text": "i'd believe.  so i think that that uh... my record and the reason why i think so is.  i remember a conversation about this back in the seventies when nixon resigned where uh... the reporting was that had he been impeached he would have lost his pension.  But because he resigned instead of being impeached, he didn't lose his pension.  Whether, you know, when Trump leaves office, he's going to have this pension for life.  He's going to have health care for life.  He's going to have Secret Service protection for life.  And I don't think that any of those benefits go away if he's convicted of a state crime.  He may be, you know, it may be that the feds will go after him.  I would be surprised, frankly, because I don't think that... Joe Biden or the Democrats are going to want to start a precedent of presidents putting former presidents in jail.  But it wouldn't surprise me at all if he faces serious criminal charges in New York State where Letitia James is going after him like there's no tomorrow, or Cy Vance in New York City, you know, the DA there.  And I don't think that... his being convicted in state court would blow up his federal pension.  I may be wrong on that, but I'm pretty sure I'm not. ",

Isn't it amazing that we're sitting here having actual thoughtful conversations about the president of the United States going to prison?  uh... you know it's for the second time in my lifetime.  you know that's the richard nixon the first uh... well and also there was the conversation about george w bush and dick cheney going going to prison if the uh... international criminal court in the hague went after them for lying about you know lying into the war in iraq that led to hundreds of thousands of human deaths but they just pulled us out of the court so that never happened.
