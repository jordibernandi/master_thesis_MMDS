And it will certainly raise a lot of questions, raising a lot of questions about the future of the presidential debate between these two candidates.  I wouldn't be surprised, by the way, if this is the last presidential debate between the president of the United States and the former vice president of the United States.  But we shall see fairly soon.  That was a hot mess inside a dumpster fire inside a train wreck.  That was the worst debate I have ever seen.  In fact, it wasn't even a debate.  It was a disgrace.  And it's primarily because of President Trump.  We'll talk about who won the debate, who lost the debate, but I can tell you one thing for sure.  The American people lost tonight because that was horrific.  You just took the words out of my mouth.  You used some high-minded language.  I'm just going to say it like it is.  That was a shit show.  Shit show doesn't even begin to describe it.  and you know we're on cable.  we can say that.  apologies for being um maybe a little bit crude but that is really the the phrase that i'm getting more you know from people on both sides of the aisle on text and it's the only phrase that i can think of to really describe it and i couldn't agree with you.  more jake i think we need to just pause for a moment and say that was crazy.  what was that?  It was a train wreck, but it was a train wreck of the making of one person.  I mean, we know who did it.  President Trump did this.  And in some ways, it's the only way he knows what to do.  He bulldozed over the moderator, bulldozed over Chris Wallace, bulldozed and at times flustered Joe Biden.  But I don't know if anybody wouldn't have been flustered by the president's behavior and the president's performance.  Should there be?  I mean, they're supposed they're supposed to be.  their vice presidential debate is next.  And then, you know, and then there's supposed to be two more presidential debates.  I must say, I don't think the country is going to be yearning for another one of these.  I think that Biden has a decision to make.  You know, it'll happen if he says, I don't want to I'm not going to I'm not going to dignify this with with another debate that the president will attack him for running away from debates.  But I'm not sure the country will feel that way, having watched this spectacle. ",

In any case, why you holding the big rallies?  Why you not?  You go first, sir.  Because people want to hear what I have to say.  I mean, you've done a great job as the president.  And I'll have 25,000, 35,000 people show up at airports.  We use airports.  Are you not worried about the disease issues, sir?  Well, so far, we have had no problem whatsoever.  It's outside.
