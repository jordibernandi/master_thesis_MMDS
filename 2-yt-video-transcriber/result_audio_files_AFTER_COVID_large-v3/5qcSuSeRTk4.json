So I just wanted to tell you about something that's coming up, something that I have made that will be released into the wild very soon.  Yeah, so I kind of made a short film.  had no plans to do anything of the sort, just kind of happened.  And then it felt like really important, if just to me, to finish it.  And so I did.  And now it's going into the world, which is wild.  So I'm not gonna, like, I could ramble on about context and background and like, a bunch of other stuff and try and describe it and all this.  but I'm not gonna do that, I'm just gonna say that this project was filmed entirely in the span of five days in August of this year, 2020 and it's been in various stages of post-production which feels very fancy to say in the months since then and Now it's finally coming out.  It is a film about heartbreak and catharsis and the art that gets you through those things.  And it's called The Modern Leper.  I am very excited and terrified for you to see it.  As I'm recording this, I don't have the release date yet because I'm waiting on some information from some people, but I will put the release date when you can watch it here.  This is when it's premiering.  This is when you can see it.  And yeah, I'll just say I hope you watch it.  I hope it resonates.  And I think that's it.  Okay.  I'll see you there, I guess.  Bye. ",
