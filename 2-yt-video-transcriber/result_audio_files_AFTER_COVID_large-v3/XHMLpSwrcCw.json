            "text": "Is going clubbing a waste of time and money for men?  In the video that we're gonna go into is going to break down, in my opinion, why going clubbing these days is a waste or a total inefficient use of your time and money as a man.  And this is something that personally I wish I was told more of when I was younger because I did spend many years doing the whole club scene.  And I remember not having all of that much fun.  I would kind of trick myself into like, oh yeah, clubbing is fun.  I would kind of trick myself into it.  But that just seemed like the thing to do.  If you're a guy, it's like, oh, how do you go out and dance around, flirt with women?  How do you meet women if that's your goal?  Clubbing was kind of one of those things that came up and I wish somebody would have broke down just how much it's an inefficient use of time and money for me.  So hopefully that's something you can take away from this one.  Here's four reasons, in my opinion, men should not go to clubs.  Again, I've been through all the whole thing on the clubs and all that stuff.  My recommendation is there's just really no reason to go to a club.  First thing is a waste of money.  Second thing is a waste of time.  Third is fights, false allegations.  And the fourth is bad ROI, bad return on investment.  And as a side note, I don't know if any of you guys were alive back in the days when clubs actually seemed kind of cool.  I was watching the Marvelous Miss Maisel.  I believe that's, excuse me, what it's called.  It's like the old... It like takes place in the older time.  It's like the female comic.  And they have clubs in those scenes and those look fun to like go to have like nice like jazz band playing or like the comedy clubs like that.  But you guys know the clubs we're talking about where you're going and girls are twerking all over the place.  Music's just like beating on the inside of your drum where you can't hear for the next like 17 days after going there.  Yeah, that's the type of clubs that I just like, nah, it doesn't sound appealing anymore.  All right, so here's the first reason.  Waste of money.  All right, a waste of money.  So there's gonna be a lot, and in fact, guys, if you guys see any that I miss on any of these specific categories, just put them in the chat.  So, waste of money for cover charges, right?  Going in, you know, there's some bars you can find, some clubs you can find that don't have cover charges.  Yeah, but a lot of times if you're going out in the night, at least you're hopping around from different clubs, you're gonna hit at least a few that you have to pay money just to get in.  All right, overpriced drinks and then watered down drinks at that.  Um, especially going to Vegas, man, I can't believe how much it costs at Vegas at any place to get drinks, but some places are just insane.  It's like $16.  Actually, you know what?  The only place it's ever been worth me spending 16 or $20 for a beer was when I went to the world series a couple of years back.  And that's cause my, um, uh, I got the ticket for free.  So I was just there paying for beers and I was getting the guy who brought me free beers and all that stuff.  That was the only time I was worth it for paying $16 or $20 for a beer.  I can't believe the prices at some of these clubs that you have to pay for a drink.  It's like... Man, one of these beers that cost me when I get it from the grocery store or the gas station, it's like two bucks or less for a beer.  That's how it should be.  16, 20 bucks for a beer.  That's insane.  All right, how about this?  Paying for an Uber or a Lyft, because at least in my days, when I was going clubbing a bunch, if you're smart about it, you're gonna drink as much of your own alcohol before you go there, so you're gonna have to get an Uber or a Lyft to make it there.  Or if you have somebody that's gonna drive, you're gonna have to pay for parking.  If you're one of those guys who go, well, I don't take an Uber or Lyft, and I don't pay for parking.  I drive myself.  Well, if you drink there, then the chance, if you get a DUI, the cost of that is going to be even worse.  So you're going to be hit with some of these charges for going out for a night at the clubs.  And then another one, it's hard for me to escape this one.  When you're out at the clubs... and you've been dancing or whatever, you're going to pay for some drunk munchies.  When you're walking home, you're walking around the corner, you're waiting for your Uber, you're going to stop and get your Euro.  You're going to get something there.  And this is all, when I'm calculating the own thing, it's because I don't buy women drinks and all that stuff.  When I'm calculating all this out, I'm like, man, that's a waste of money.  Now think of the guys that are with women, who the women expect them to pay for their cover charges.  They expect, you know, the women expect the men to pay for their overpriced drinks.  The women expect men to pay for the Uber and the Lyft and all that stuff.  And to pay for her drunk munchies too.  So big one right there, waste of money.  So much more you could do with your money than go to a club.  All right, now here's the other one.  Number two here, inefficient use of time.  And I'm not gonna say it's a waste of time because there are gonna be guys that go, well, it was a lot of fun or that I got laid.  So it wasn't a waste of time, they'll say.  I'm saying it's an inefficient use of time.  And I'll preface this in two ways.  The first way I'll say this is if you're a guy that is successful at the clubs, and you can game women and score and bring them home and do all that stuff, I'm gonna say it's an inefficient use of time because if you're able to do that, club game is pretty hard.  If you're able to do that, then I promise you, for far less effort, I could teach you how to online date and you'll have a pool of better women.  because Yeah, online dating, we know that it's not the best crop of women, but I know women that are on online dating that won't go to clubs.  But all club women are like, yeah, I'm gonna try online dating.  So you even get a small sliver of better women, so much less time, effort, and energy.  So it's an inefficient use of time.  If you know how to game women at clubs, you're more socially adept at doing that, you can learn online dating, you can learn text game, you can learn how to do it at other places.  So I just think it's an inefficient use of time.  uh for that sense now think about getting ready.  all right getting ready includes not only like getting done up or whatever you're gonna do but also um actually i'd be rolling in the club with something like this like a baseball jersey or whatever.  uh but getting ready also counts like i mentioned before.  um when you don't want to pay for these insane club price drinks getting ready is like going out pre-funking pre-partying with your buddies.  that whole thing.  it's like going to a club.  there's like you're like setting aside a night for it typically prowling the dance floor, and I use that word specifically, prowling, because you guys know how it is, man.  You guys know how it is, man.  Prowling the dance floor, just take your average night at the club, and it's like a bunch of zookeeper men on the outside.  prowling, looking at the dance floor where there's like these zoo animal women just dancing in front of all these zookeeper men.  There's usually a couple guys in there doing their thing dancing.  But you guys know the typical night, right?  We can trick ourself all we want.  The typical club night is a bunch of dudes standing around.  It's all sweaty.  It's all hot.  You can't talk to each other.  Music's blasting, prowling around, hoping that some woman just like turns on you and just starts grinding on you.  And she's just like, I'm in love with you.  That's just the hope, and it never happens, right?  Very rarely ever happens.  And then here's the other one, man.  Waiting in line for drinks.  That one is annoying because if you know the right tricks, and yeah, you give the bartender a nice tip the first time they get your drink so they know to serve you faster next time.  Well, now it bleeds into, number one, wasting more money because you're having to put a better tip out there just to get service, to get your drink when... I got my own fridge right here.  Look at this.  Look how easy this is for me to get a drink.  I don't have a wait line.  Got my Vikings little cooler here.  Boom.  Pop it out.  I got my next beer ready.  That's how it is.  You don't have to wait in lines at the club.  And then the whole thing, like I mentioned, gaming the girl.  Guys, gaming the girl.  Best case scenario.  Best case scenario.  If you're going out and you're trying to meet a woman.  Best case.  You're going to have to do all of this thing.  You're going to have to dance with her multiple times.  Probably buy her drinks.  I would get around it.  I would do the whole thing.  I got to go to the bathroom.  I go get my own drink.  And I'd randomly stumble back into her later, whatever.  And she would have bought her own drink or got a drink from a different guy.  Yeah, there's ways around it.  But if you're going to actually game the girl, guys, there's so many things you got to take into account.  You got to figure out what friends she's with.  How are you going to get those friends to trust you enough that they give you the okay and don't try to cockblock you?  then you got to figure out, well, you know, where's her car out?  How's she getting home?  Where does she live after this?  If she comes to your place, how are you going to get her home?  There's so many things that actually like, other than just, okay, meet a girl that a lot of guys don't think about, but if you're actually going to do it, All of this stuff, inefficient use of time.  It's taking all of this stuff to get the girl.  And again, I don't know a lot of guys that would go to a club other than to meet women or to dance on women, right?  It's not a place you go to bond.  Hey guys, hey buddies, guys, get all out.  It's guys night out.  We're going to go to the club and we're going to dance all night.  How often is that really true?  I mean, let's be honest.  How often is that really true?  Bunch of dudes get together to go dance at the club and live it up.  It's like, nah, you would do a lot of other things with your buddies.  I would much rather play beer pong in a garage at one of my buddies place than go clubbing.  So many other things you could do with your time than do that.  And as I say this, there will be some guys.  There are some guys, and I've seen it with my own eyes, right?  I've learned club game.  I'm not the best at club game.  I've learned it, but I know some buddies that are really good.  Now, if you're really good, I get it.  Why would you change?  And especially because guys like me and a lot of other guys are just like, nah, I'm good.  I'm not going to go to the club.  So your competition diminishes.  I understand that.  I understand that.  I still think if you have that type of game, it's ineffective or inefficient because you can learn how to do it in so many other ways, low effort wise, like online dating.  It's so easy if you have game.  What if you are young and attractive?  Well, see again, when I say club thing, it's like even between a club and going out, I don't say to guys like you can't have fun, right?  You can't spend some free time and just do whatever.  It's not even that.  It's like, You could go to a bar that has pool, that has darts, that has something where you can actually sit down, hang out with your buddies, chat with them, actually have a nice social night.  There's other ways than the club specifically.  To me, the club, I don't go anymore unless... unless we're going for like a buddy's bachelor party, you know, it's his last free night and he's going to be around women, that's, you know, his way to do it.  I get it, right?  I get it.  I'll do those sometimes.  Maybe if we go to Vegas, people want to go out to a club or something.  Yeah, I'll do that.  But if around town here, for probably the last five years, what I've done is if I'm with people and we're out at the bar hanging out with some buddies and they want to go to a club after or we're with women and they want to go to a club after, That's when, and I don't recommend you do this until you get girls in your rotation, but that is when I will simply go, okay, everyone's going to go to the club in an hour or something.  I just pull out my phone.  I text two or three girls.  Hey, what are you up to tonight?  And I'll get one of them to respond.  Oh, I'm not doing anything.  You want to hang out?  And then I'll just say, hey, yeah, can you go pick me up at whatever, blah, blah, blah, downtown.  And so as we finally get to the club, I don't have to spend any time in the club now.  It's like, as we're on our way there, I just get a girl to pick me up and we go back to my place.  That's how much I just realized.  clubs are a waste of time.  And yeah, it's just, to me, waste of time.  But again, you know, do what you want to do here.  All right, now back to this question.  Is going clubbing a waste of time and money if you're a man?  What do you think?  What's your personal opinion on that?  Let us know below.  And yeah, I mean, if you are a guy that still goes clubbing or you think it's an efficient use of your time, I would love to know that.  I'm very curious about your perspective.  So tell us why then if you do believe so.  And of course, if you don't believe so, let us know why too.  because again, When guys that are a little uncertain or guys that are kind of going, hey, I don't know, all my friends go clubbing, should I do it?  The more guys that can kind of just say, hey, I've been through that, I've done that thing, you're going to more often than not waste your time and money.  I think that will help a lot of guys from blowing a lot of their time and money at clubs, especially if you're a guy in college or in your 20s, that seems to be something that know a lot of guys end up doing.  don't forget subscribe like comment share the video but definitely subscribe.
