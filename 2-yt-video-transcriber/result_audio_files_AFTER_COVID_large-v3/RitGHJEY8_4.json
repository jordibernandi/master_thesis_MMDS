            "text": "Hello and welcome back to No Bullshit.  Today we return to talking about the Young Turks, the least reliable, most biased, and partisan name in internet news.  If you can even call these guys news to begin with.  I mean, come on.  Sure, they present themselves as if they're the sort of CNN of YouTube, but at the same time, TYT isn't actually reporting on anything at all.  All they do is read articles other reporters researched and wrote for them.  and other companies and websites made outside of their purview.  Regardless, it's undeniable that The Young Turks has become a major channel and big player in the web and its news gathering, for better or for worse.  Actually, you know what?  It's for worse.  For sure.  For worse.  In fact, TYT's growing internet presence has even gone so far, and it's gone to their leaders' heads so much, they thought they could spin this racket off into a successful political campaign.  As we discussed a few months ago, at the end of last year, the leader of The Young Turks, Cenk Uygur, He's been making an attempt at a run for Congress.  That's right.  And now, after our latest round of voting took place earlier this week on what we call Super Tuesday here in America, well, you're never going to guess how this turned out for the Young Turks.  Actually, you really can guess because, as expected, Cenk suffered a terrible loss, barely scraping together 500 votes from his district.  This happened for a variety of reasons.  First and foremost, Cenk Uygur and TYT are just insufferable.  Their message is terrible and their personalities are off-putting.  And the only reason anyone related to this project is popular or noteworthy is because they've had massive donors over the years, particularly from the Middle East, and they're supported by Al Jazeera.  And in addition, the mainstream media and liberal legacy politicians and the new progressives all support TYT.  Well, at least they provide lip service to them as they rise in relevance online.  But that kind of support certainly doesn't translate into political votes, especially in a more obscure district in California, one which Cenk doesn't live in nor has he hardly ever visited.  Then to top all that off, Cenk is facing a bigger and much better name in politics.  Christy Smith is his political competition, and if you've ever seen her or him speak and campaign in the slightest, you could tell why this race wasn't even close.  Christy Smith is a likable, well-put-together, and decent-looking individual who would be a respectable leader for that district, but Cenk?  He's a garish, bloviating, terrible kind of person who no one could get along with.  But the hows and whys as to why Cenk lost his election are all so obvious, and it's such a played out and easy subject to tackle, I think we already went over all we need to say for that.  Cenk was a horrible candidate, and no one likes him, and he's not from that district, and Also, his competition, Christy Smith, was far superior.  But in addition to all of that, what's most fun to consider here is the sheer and pure and absolute hubris that's been put on display in light of all of this situation.  Cenk and TYT's pride and vanity and conceitedness have all been exposed fully because only some stark liberals living in a very sheltered and claustrophobic bubble like California, well, only a very out-of-touch and full-of-themselves group like this would ever go this far with this election stuff.  So moving forward, we're going to go over Cenk and the Young Turks breakdown here, and how they've shown their lost and out of touch.  And get ready for a wild ride today guys, because this latest meltdown really rivals their last epic failure, which was caught live on the air on their own show back in 2016. when the Young Turks just couldn't believe that Donald J. Trump won the presidency in the United States.  Yep, looks like now, four years later, and not only have the Young Turks not learned their lessons, they've actually doubled down and gotten far, far worse.  So, for our first example of this, I want you all to check out a clip from the live TYT show that was going on the day of the Super Tuesday elections.  Here, Cenk pretty much already knows he's losing at this point, so he gets all red-faced and huffing and puffing and basically storms off of his own show, promising to Skype in later.  Take a look at the clip for yourself and let's see how this goes. ",

Well, if not, I might not actually be enjoying this as much, but keep all that in mind.  Cenk and TYT are some of the worst, if not the worst, when it comes to liberals and pushing of progressive politics.  These guys helped bolster groups like BLM and Antifa, and in addition, they also helped create the group the Justice Democrats, for Christ's sake.  Justice Democrats are the ones who made AOC a thing, by the way.  And then to top that off, TYT has been supporting communists like Bernie Sanders and shilling for him since all the way back in 2016.  And that section of their portfolio will bring us more lulls here later too, soon, since Bernie also lost pretty big on Super Tuesday as well.  But before we get to that, let's first wrap up this hilarious scene of Cenk, who's obviously getting choked up.  He can barely wrap up his livestream here and it's only getting started.  Things get worse and more cringy as Cenk doubles down and asks for more donations in this clip.  as he's exiting his own show in shame after losing his congressional bid by a very large margin. ",

            "text": "The guy is literally choking on his own words as he asks his audience for yet another round of donations.  Dude, you just took their money and wasted it all on this bogus campaign for Congress.  Probably should have put that money into your dying show.  And if you had asked any rational person about this beforehand, they would have told you that this congressional bid to be a politician, well, it's a complete waste of time for you.  But again, Cenk and TYT are far too deep in the rabbit hole.  And they're too far into their bubble and used to their safe spaces which have coddled them for far too long.  And now they can't see the truth anymore.  But this does raise another more important point.  TYT is literally about to go bankrupt too.  Sure they could get saved and they could get corporate funding again like they do all the time.  And that's not even mentioning the fact that Cenk's dad owns a billion-dollar company and Anna Kasparian, his co-host, well, she comes from a wealthy multi-million-dollar family as well.  But despite TYT being run by a bunch of rich kids, it's really failed at becoming a successful long-term moneymaker.  Of course, Cenk and Anna have made themselves millions and whoever gets employed by TYT makes a wage at that time.  But as far as long-term and a going-forward model, well, this show has no future going forward.  They've overexpanded and squandered their goodwill with the public so much that the show has passed the point of being sustainable.  That's why recently they've had to cut corners, like when they cancelled a few of their ancillary shows and channels last year and let go of people like Hannah Cranston.  And just recently, Cenk even fired his own nephew, Hasan Piker, who's now gone on to become a Twitch streamer who shit-talks his uncle online regularly, actually.  But That's a whole other story.  The point here today is, in addition to losing this election, Cenk is also probably going to lose his whole news company soon too, and his career and platform in the process.  Now, before we move back to talking about the breakdown in Super Tuesday losses, it is important to further discuss this breaking down of TYT for just another moment.  You see, this is all running together and going hand in hand.  And although Cenk's election loss is more concrete and official, his loss of the Young Turks is also seeming more and more imminent.  Or at the very least, TYT will have to restructure and reform and revamp their entire system in order to survive going forward.  Because in addition to having a failing leader and an overexpanded and outdated business model, well also, TYT has recently faced the challenge of having its workers attempt to unionize.  Now, this is supposed to be a good thing for liberals, especially for these kinds of extreme socialist left-wingers who always preach about being pro-union, pro the people, and supporting of workers and their rights.  But that's easy for these hack communist political types to say in theory, but when they actually have to face unionization of their own companies and employees and political projects, well, these types of people, when they actually face it in reality, they of course resist.  Because unionizing, while good for the individual worker, It is rather challenging for the business overall, especially when you're already in a precarious situation like TYT, remember that.  And well, a union forming within them could be the problem that tears their whole operation down to the ground.  Now you gotta pay your employees more and give them higher rates, and you have to choose people within their union and you have to also modernize and rebuild all your spaces to specific codes now.  Breaks in time off are now heavily regulated, and you can't fire people at will anymore, nor can you hire whoever you want anymore either.  Lots of complications and red tape arise in union operations, so with TYT already struggling to survive, well, them resisting here does make sense, but at the same time, keep in mind, these are the same kinds of people who claim to be pro-union socialists.  and of the people communists all the time, so Cenk now being anti-union is rather hypocritical to say the least.  It's kind of like how his preferred presidential candidate Bernie Sanders claims to be anti-capitalist and socialist too, but also at the same time, he makes millions of dollars by selling books in a capitalist system here in America.  And also Bernie of course owns three houses, two of which he could easily give away if he was a true socialist.  Yes, Cenk is just as two-faced as Bernie Sanders, or quite possibly and more likely, Cenk is markedly worse.  Speaking of Cenk and Bernie, well, Cenk's loss wasn't the only blow to the TYT show this week.  Bernie, of course, did very poorly at the Super Tuesday elections as well.  Sure, he managed to get more than the 500 or so votes that Cenk got, but even so, Bernie lost big to Joe Biden on Tuesday.  And as mentioned earlier with the TYT going all in behind Bernie again in this election, well, that means that technically they lost twice this week now.  Cenk and Anna just keep taking L after L right now, huh?  I can't say I'm surprised, but also, I'm happy to see it and I'm ecstatic we all get to watch this meltdown again.  And with all that said, let's check out another clip where this time Cenk tries to cope with Bernie losing.  This happened a bit before he stormed off his own show that day too.  So we're going a little out of order in the timeline here, but I think it all makes sense as we spell it all out.  So without further ado, let's check out this next clip. ",

And on top of that, loose cannons like Cenk Uygur here, they're constantly speaking in over-the-top militaristic and physical fighting type ways, literally saying they want to kick their opponent's asses and then slightly saying, oh, I'm just saying that, that's just me talking, but we know what the truth is.  This guy is clearly losing his shit, and this breakdown is just getting started too.  Also, keep in mind, this is what happened right before Cenk left the air earlier, so now we're getting to the context of that, and what led to that eventual meltdown and walk away.

The likes of CNN and MSNBC are obviously inspirations here.  Really, TYT is just a poor man's online version of those cable news networks.  So I don't see how Cenk can argue they know better than them at all.  The only difference is the mainstream media is currently lying for Biden and Cenk is trying to lie for Bernie.  And now we can see Biden is winning and Bernie is failing and it's causing TYT and Cenk to lose their shit once again.  And seeing all this liberal infighting is fun to watch too.  And the worse it gets for them, the better it gets for us and Trump in the election.  If the Democrats keep attacking and dividing themselves further, only half of their party is going to end up showing up and voting in the presidential election in November.  And this will leave the floor wide open for us Republicans and conservative leaners to take over and win again with our boy, President Trump. ",

Really, watching these guys laugh and crack wise and try and play it cool and smile and joke about this, it just goes to show a few other things.  First of all, they're obviously stuck in this liberal Hollywood bubble.  Then there's a separate TYT bubble going on here too, where these jokers hang with each other all week all the time, thinking they're actually significant reporters when really they're not.  And as stated earlier, if Cenk had anyone talking sense around him, well he's clearly not listening to them because they would have said this campaign is a waste of time and money.  Not to mention, Cenk is wasting away what political clout and goodwill with the people he might have had before.  That's all going down the drain, all so the man could stroke his own ego and run for some random election in a district of California he could hardly locate on a map.  In the end, we've clearly seen Cenk Uygur and TYT break down immensely this week.  And it's a good sign.  our pro-Trump conservative side is still winning greatly in modern times.  These losers and their failed progressive and liberal ideologies They're going by the wayside, even in starkly liberal areas like Southern California.  And also, fortunately, this year is only just beginning.  2020 still holds a lot more in store for us, now and in the immediate future.  We got more primary, small local elections, campaigns, and the final presidential election in November, all to be ready for soon.  So with all that in mind, I think we got plenty of more TYT and liberal meltdown stories coming for us soon, in our near future, which I just can't wait for.  What do you guys think?  Is TYT and Cenk Uygur breaking down?  Is anyone besides Cenk's crew surprised he lost his election?  And do you think TYT will be going bankrupt in the near future too?
