            "text": "Hi everyone, Saint Mayne here.  This video is brought to you by a donation from Mr.  Anonymous, and he didn't give me a specific topic.  So what I'd like to do is cover a Reddit post that I've put in the description called, Does the Wall No Longer Exist?  by someone named IndianPunjabiGoth, and here's what he has to say.  In a recent podcast, Sandman Head with a Blackpill content maker, they were discussing how tall, muscular men with square jaws are now dating ugly 50-year-old women.  Sandman says that he sees this way too often these days.  Even 10 out of 10 men are dating twos because now 90% of women go for the top 1%.  He said women have admitted that they don't care about ending up as cat ladies but won't go any lower.  They would risk going to the grave as a spinster.  Is it really that bad now?  Unquote.  Well, Mr.  Anonymous, thanks for the donation and thank you, Mr.  Indian, for asking that particular question.  I'll get to my answer in just a moment, but let me first tell everyone about today's sponsor, Lindsey Transmission.  Kit Lindsey owns and operates his tranny shop in Missouri.  No, not these types of trannies, but these types.  He fixes vintage transmissions in many of the cars that you see here.  So if you've got a classic car in the United States or Canada, you can ship him the parts through UPS.  He accomplishes the repair and then sends it back.  He's also a fellow MGTOW and one of the few men in the country who works on antique and classic car transmissions.  So give him a call.  His contact information is in the description below.  Anyways, now back to the video.  I used to think that the wall existed and that women after a certain age and single mothers could no longer get to the top tier guys, but I was wrong.  All it takes is for a handful of women to do this and it gives hope to the remaining women.  That they too can watch the years go by while holding out for hope for some rich high status patsy to swoop right in, in like a simp to save their lives.  I've seen older women in their 50s and 60s to learn how to keep their mouths shut to attract the highest quality men out there.  with lots of wealth.  And they can do much better simply through silence.  One guy I spoke to was shocked that there was a quiet woman out there.  Even Dave Chappelle has spoken about how silence is one of the four things a woman can do to make a man happy.  But you'd be surprised how many women have never tried it.  Many of the older women I've seen that get the tall and financially well-to-do guys are obviously post-ball.  But they take care of themselves for their age with good hygiene and exercise.  So it's not overweight women that I've seen pull this off or those with mom bots.  Plus, they've also had very pleasant personalities when their mouths weren't shut.  For women like that, the wall didn't matter because they were easygoing enough to make men's lives nice.  Ask yourself this particular question if you're a high-end demand man in his early 30s and doesn't care about having kids and is looking for a marriage or long-term relationship.  Would you rather be with a bitchy and narcissistic 20-something-year-old woman that won't give you a moment's peace?  Or would you rather be with a woman in her early 40s that is pleasant to be around and makes you feel appreciated?  Well, Mr.  Indian, I wasn't talking about ugly 50-year-old women getting such men.  I was talking about average or above-average women looking that age.  Also, the 10 out of 10 guys are certainly not dating the twos.  Traditionally, they would date the eights, nines, and tens.  Now it's more likely that they're banging the six, sevens, and eights, because it's less drama and also because there's less competition.  As I've said in other videos, women are becoming increasingly spiteful.  Plus, the younger generations are smaller than the older ones, and the younger guys have to compete with older guys with much more money and resources for the same exact women.  So it's inevitable, for example, that in Western countries that if a Caucasian male wants a Caucasian female, there are less of those being born.  So he's going to have to be more open to dating and marrying women from a minority.  Or as I've stated, an older woman.  That part about women not caring if they end up as cat ladies was from the Insulmatics documentary.  It ties in perfectly with me seeing women in their 50s and 60s staying single for a decade or longer, looking for the right man, and when they find him, settling down with him.  Obviously, if they were interested in sex and companionship, then why would they wait 10 years to get into a serious relationship or marriage?  I remember while I was growing up, I went over to a friend's house and his mother was sleeping with a 25-year-old guy.  For her, it was about sex and she was messing with my friend's self-esteem and feminizing him as a result.  I've heard other women say that they don't want children because they want to save the environment and not add to the problems of overpopulation.  Some of these women were ones that would make great mothers.  Something I also noticed with many of the younger guys getting together with older post-war women is that they aren't having children either because they can't have them or because they made that choice.  Some of the men that are the best specimens aren't reproducing because they're putting their sperm stick inside of an antique pie hole.  Other women are seeing that they don't have to give a guy kids.  They don't have to settle for an older guy with resources because younger guys with resources are willing to chase them too.  And they would rather wait decades of their lives, if not forever, instead of settling down for an old man.  The wall exists in countries like China, where there's social pressure from parents on their sons to marry younger women at, say, the age of 27.  So they could have kids with them.  But even Chinese post-war women are looking for foremen that don't have such ancient ideas in their head like family and fertility.  They too are busy being thirsty to care about having one.  I should know because at one point I was in the exact same position.  Just not with an older woman.  Just with one.  that was my age.  On that Reddit post, someone mentioned that there were women over the age of 40 that wanted a guy to be tall, handsome, and make over $100,000 a year.  She won't settle for less, and if she's not good enough, she won't have to.  Other guys below that comment agree with me that she might find one because the dating scene is so messed up.  Some guys say that older women have been riding the carousel more than the younger ones, and therefore are gross.  But that hasn't been what I've experienced and seen.  As I mentioned earlier, I've seen women in their 50s stay single an entire decade before Mr.  Right ended up showing up.  Some people say that men should actually have higher standards, but a thirsty and starving man that needs to crack open a cooch will do so and call it caviar.  Some guys out there also say that all men are looking for looks and fertility, but I beg to differ.  Many men are willing to forego both to a massive extent for the peace of mind that comes from a quiet woman.  The quiet ones are the sneakiest because to play the game of love, they don't have to do anything.  Just sit quietly and I fell for this trick because of the joy that I received from being able to hear my own thoughts instead of hearing some thoughts' complaints.  Most guys want what appears to be a quiet, mentally stable woman that they can have sex with on a regular basis with and have a peaceful life with.  The middle-aged spinsters that figure this out have hit the jackpot.  You've never seen the joy on a man's face when his wife or girlfriend acts like a non-person.  when she appears as though the lights are on in her body, but the lights in her brain are not functioning.  There are tons of surveys that say that men are more interested in less educated or less intelligent women.  The purpose of love for myself and many guys is to shut our minds down and enjoy it.  Not to be playing a game of 4D chess with some chick.  Another guy under your post, Mr.  Indian, says that what I'm observing is pumping and dumping, and that sex is easily available from the 35-plus crowd of crumpet out there, but that it doesn't translate into relationships.  Well, from my experience, I've seen it not only translate into relationships, but also marriages.  I've seen simps with rich daddies marry much older women and then get tricked into having kids with them.  Then the rich parents die and the inheritance money comes into the marriage, they get divorced, and the woman takes the guy to the cleaners.  You have to wonder about these older women that have just one kid with younger and much wealthier guys.  I've seen these sorts of things in Canada, but maybe it just hasn't gotten that bad in the United States yet.  Maybe guys in the comment section can share where they live and if they've seen anything like this what I'm describing.  Another guy says that there's no chance that a younger guy is going to date an older woman unless there's money involved.  And I'm assuming he means that the older women are sugar mamas.  Wrong again from my observations.  Here's a man that can't believe that men are getting that thirsty.  I think of it like this.  The younger guys want a relationship and love that men from older generations got.  They see they can't get that from women their own generation or younger... So they figure.  since the boomers took their money and futures through the unfair financial system, they might as well take the boomers' babes away from them too.  Obviously, that's not the real situation, but many of these older women with younger guys I met weren't on Tinder as much as the younger women.  They probably didn't get the same doses of attention that younger women got online.  The experiences I'm sharing happened between two and six years ago.  For all I know, maybe they've discovered Tinder by now.  Who knows?  But what I know is that many guys in their 20s and 30s would have been with a woman like Karen Strawn, even though she's a single mother of three in her early 40s, when she was at her peak popularity.  There's a deep part of a young man's psyche that wants to respect a woman and find a woman that's his equal.  That's a myth that many smarter, older women also play into.  Men's desire for the wise, sexy mother he never had.  That could also be another reason for this sort of behavior in younger men.  They might be looking for a relationship to repair the relationship they had with their parental unit of the opposite sex.  It could also be that the younger man doesn't value his sexual marketplace value correctly and chooses the first woman that comes along.  I've known guys that got married and had kids with the first woman that gave them some attention.  But I'm not saying that that's what happened to these younger Chad guys getting together with soccer moms.  They did get attention from women before, but what I saw was super bitchy and abusive.  Near the end of my dating adventures in 2015, I dated a couple of older women.  One of them was about seven or eight years older because I was tired of the attitude from the younger ones.  She didn't have an attitude, but she was way too politically correct.  All the women I dated back in 2015 ended up getting married and most of them had only one child to seal the deal with the guy.  That one that was seven or eight years older than me was already barren, but she still got a man.  She was Indian and she married a white Caucasian guy.  He looks a bit older than her, but he looks like there's mega pain in his eyes in his wedding photos.  I wish I could share them with everyone, but that would give me away.  The wall certainly didn't exist for her if I was willing to date her even after I'd been red-pilled for three years up to that point.  And no, I wasn't looking for a pump-and-dump.  I was looking for a relationship with someone that didn't have baby rabies in their mid-30s that was trying to trick me into getting them pregnant.  I got sick of women my own age at that time because of the need to squeeze out some crotch fruit smoothies.  To end this video, I just want to read a poem someone posted on Reddit from the 19th century called The Bachelor Problem.  And it goes something like this, and I quote, Who'd wish to wed?  Unquote.  While men seemed to be eager to go their own way in the 19th century, I still don't think they had it that bad to chase after a quiet hag that didn't set off any red flags, because she was depending on the resources in a younger man's loot bag.
