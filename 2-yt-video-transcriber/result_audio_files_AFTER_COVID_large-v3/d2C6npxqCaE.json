            "text": "okay youtubers this is the angry prepper.  so today's video is going to be on.  are you ready for civil war now?  the short answer is no.  no one is no one's ready for civil war on american soil at least not again.  there are a lot of guys online talking about getting some killing these dudes beating up these guys.  now listen beating up people that's fine i get it.  you know we most of us have been in a fist fight in our life so we understand the ramifications of a fist fight.  but for those of us who've never killed anybody uh civil war on american soil in 2020 or 2021 or 2022 whatever happens is going to be uh something we are not ready for now.  the subject came up uh the other day my buddy who i was talking to.  he states that uh a combat vet and i'm pretty sure a lot of your combat vets will agree that we are not ready for civil war.  we're not ready to do that kind of damage to one another Though it seems to be happening and though there are a few people out there who are absolutely ready to do it.  It's Normandy to the left.  The left is ready to do some sick shit, as we've already seen.  With the exception of, again, Kyle Rittenhouse, who is self-defense.  So, therein lies the problem.  You're going to have psychopaths that are looking to kick it off.  Okay?  But those are psychopaths.  Those are not reasonable people.  They're people that just want to get their gun off.  A lot of people seem to think the right or Trump supporters or Proud Boys or whatever it is, they want to get their gun off.  No.  A lot of right-wing guys, especially guys I know, they're not looking to start any kind of war.  They're hoping this shit dies off on its own.  But it doesn't seem to be the case.  So, With this combat veteran saying what he said, as I'm talking with my buddy, it dawned on me we're not ready.  It dawned on me that this is something that we're going to have to adapt to and adapt fast if it happens.  There's too much at stake here in American soil.  There's way too much at stake with fighting a civil war in 2020 in America because there's not going to be a set location.  Civil war is going to happen where it happens, whether that's Seattle, whether that's California, New York, Florida, Detroit, some Midwest town.  That's where it's going to happen.  It's going to happen in an urban environment.  There's just too much at stake.  With today's technology, you get into a fight with somebody, they're going to look your name up.  Like we looked up the guy that shot the Trump supporter.  and found everything they needed to know about him.  We could do the same thing.  And both sides, I mean, not just the right, not just the left, both sides are gonna look up and find who this person is, where he lives, where he's about, where his family lives.  So now you have to worry about your family during a civil war like this, right?  Now, there were points in time in the civil war, in the old, where yes, the Union burned down Confederate homes, Confederate burned down, some Northern homes or Union homes, if you will, that went back and forth and there was probably some killing.  But at the rate here, at least you knew where the battleground was in the old Civil War.  The new Civil War, there won't be any battle lines.  There won't be a field.  There won't be a state.  It'll be all over.  And that's the problem.  Again, guys, along with tracking uh yourself down you the person who's in battle whatever it is your family and friends obviously going to be tracked down.  they could be hurt they could be killed and that's a lot of responsibility when it comes to getting in a battle.  now when getting in a battle at least in american history battles always been somewhere else after the civil war right and it was in other countries And you didn't have to worry about your family much being in other countries.  Being that the war was in other countries.  Sorry.  So now you have civil war here.  Now you have a lot to worry about.  You're not going to have the weapon depot, the ammo guy, the mechanic to fix your shit.  You're not going to have all that like the military has.  Therein lies a lot of different problems with civil warring in the United States, especially in 2020.  Because this civil war is not going to be sanctioned.  It's not going to be two governments fighting it out.  It's going to be the people fighting it out, left and the right.  Are you going to be able to handle the death?  the horror that comes with wars.  Most likely not.  If you've never seen blood, or seen little blood, you're definitely not going to handle the fucking injuries and shit you see behind that.  That's going to be a fucking problem in itself.  Then, there's the dying of your friends, your buddies, right?  Maybe a family member.  Are you going to be able to deal with that?  And once you guys get into that realm of fighting, are you going to be able to handle the family member, the friend dying, and then second guessing every move you made in that battle of skirmish.  It's a lot of shit to think about, guys, when it comes to the Civil War, especially now.  That being said, the mental tolls are going to be something a lot of us cannot handle.  And I say yes because I'm included in that.  Yes, I've seen my shared traumas.  I've seen the Trade Center.  I've seen a lot of death and gore.  nonetheless i don't think i'm ready to see friends die and not an abundance of friends die.  the physical toll.  forget it guys.  i mean some of you have seen documentaries on war and they start following the kid who just signs up and by the end of the war or the end of his uh his time out there He looks like a tattered old man.  because of the stress, because of watching his friends die, because of worrying about family at home, even though they're safe.  There's still that stress.  So all of these stresses build up and it becomes harsh on the body.  PTSD.  Are you ready to deal with that?  PTSD, guys, doesn't mean you go into battle and boom, you're fucked up.  PTSD could rear its ugly head years later.  It could rear its head right after the battle.  It could rear its ugly head years later.  I had the situation of dealing with the Trade Center PTSD a year later.  So I thought because nothing was happening and, you know, I wasn't having these nightmares, I was good.  And then the fucking bottom dropped out onto me.  And I started having all these little problems.  Nothing bad and nothing close to what military veterans suffer.  But nonetheless, if you're going to have a civil war in this country, you better believe there's going to be an abundance of PTSD patients, if you will.  Alright guys, so now, I'm gonna call some of you guys out.  And this is a general call out.  It's not pointing fingers at one person.  But this shit isn't a movie, guys.  This shit is real life.  And this, you know, I'm gonna kill the first dude that, you know, comes in my store.  And a lot of you guys are like, I'm gonna shoot these looters.  You don't know what the fuck you're gonna do until you're in that situation.  You're speaking out of, again, fucking emotions.  You're speaking out of anger.  You're speaking out of your ass.  You do not know what you're going to do until you're in that situation.  Growing up, when I was a kid, I used to be like, I'm going to kill that dude.  He fucks with me again.  He steps foot on this block.  Yeah, I used to be that kid.  He steps on this block.  We're going at it.  Now, yes, we'd go at it.  But I never killed a motherfucker.  Because... That is the ultimate responsibility, killing another human.  It's not the movies.  It's not bang, bang, bang, and then the next scene, you're eating in a diner, fucking waffles and toast and shit.  That is not how it works.  The real world has real consequences.  Emotionally, physically, real consequences.  Here's another possibly unforeseen problem.  You're going to have monsters that are going to be created out of this, but you're also going to have heroes that are created out of this.  So, monsters are the guys who are going to do the ugly shit, guys.  I'm going to tell you right now, for a lot of you guys that think you know about violence and all this other bullshit because you read it in a book or you might have seen it in movies, Military guys, EMT firemen, cops, correction officers.  These are people who have seen true monsters, true violence.  If you've ever seen what cartel does to people, those are monsters.  And Civil War can create that kind of a monster.  The Second World War, the Nazis created a ton of monsters.  A ton.  You could get that kind of drawback in a civil war and you do not want that.  and here's the kicker guys.  shit cannot be undone once it's in motion.  if civil war kicks off there is shit that cannot be pulled back.  there are things that cannot be undone.  there are things that cannot be unseen.  and this is why I tell everyone, tread lightly with this Civil War shit and wanting to kill people.  Because there's a lot of shit you cannot undo once it's done.  Alright guys, so this is The Angry Pepper.  Thank you for watching.  You can like and subscribe to this channel.
