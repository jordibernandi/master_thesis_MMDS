            "text": "What's up beautiful family?  I hope that you guys are having a great morning.  I wanted to just come on here and chat with you guys this morning.  I hope everybody had a good weekend.  I know that we did.  We just got away.  I went back to my hometown and we stayed at the... Sorry, I was getting a message.  We stayed at the Omni.  I used to be in the business, so we get really good deals whenever we go back home to my hometown.  And I could probably stay with family, but everybody likes their privacy.  So it was just really good to not only get away, my son always talks about the beach.  And the last time we took him to the beach, he was too little.  but he really really enjoyed himself this time.  it was just really like that's the most rewarding part to see.  um you know my son like really happy and just running around and just super excited.  um but yeah we took him to the beach or whatever and it was really good to just get away and also see family.  I got to have dinner with my aunt and her boyfriend and my dad and a few friends and it was just really, it was nice to get away.  Like we work really hard.  I say I work really hard but my husband works harder than any person that I know.  So he deserves it too.  But I hope everybody had a good weekend.  I wanted to come on here because I just want people to just kind of understand the times that we're living in.  And sometimes we just need to ask the Lord to give us clarity on that.  There's a lot of people who are Christians that believe in the Lord.  But they are a little oblivious to the times that we're living in.  And that could be for a number of different reasons.  You know, a lot of people are just scared and it really just.  you know, you have to get into the word and realize who you are in Christ.  And you have to understand that there is no reason for any born again Christian to fear The end times, you know, when we see all of these things happen, they're actually good.  It's good news for the believer because it shows the times that we're living in and it goes to show that we're almost up out of here.  So if you're struggling right now and you just don't really... think that you fully grasp like the times that we're living in.  just ask the Lord.  you know what it comes down to anything.  just ask the Lord say Lord if we really are in the final moments of the end of days then please show me and he's done it for me multiple times over and over and over again confirmation after confirmation and I feel like us as children of God like have to be.  you know he has to confirm things for us over and over again because I just know I'm that way and I'm sure you guys are too.  But as I was sitting there, um, last night, no night before watching the ocean, it was dark outside and I was sitting there and it was just this overwhelming, like understanding, um, just came into my spirit.  And I know it was the Lord just like speaking to me.  I could see like, it was so peaceful and it was so calm out there at night at the beach.  And, um, it was just.  i could sense the restrainer.  if that makes sense to you guys i'm trying to explain it as best as i could i could.  it was so peaceful out there and there were like no waves and you could just hear the crashing of the ocean.  it was just there was like um uh heat lightning happening in the back and it was just beautiful and it was calming and i could just sense like it was the lord.  i felt the lord speaking to me saying that know we're still in the dispensation of grace like people.  and what that means is jesus did it all on the cross for you almost 2 000 years ago.  he said it is finished.  he was that final sacrifice and the gospel is good news.  that's that's why we people always say if the gospel is good news because it is.  you know jesus doesn't ask anything from you other than to put.  to put your your trust and your faith in jesus christ to um put your belief in him.  repentance means metanoia.  um it.  it means to go from unbelief to belief.  and so we're in the dispensation of grace right now.  where all people have to do is make that decision whether they're going to believe or not.  and you know the reason why people who are preaching the true gospel the reason why they get railed day in and day out is because of satan.  satan hates the truth.  there's only one truth.  jesus says there's only or god says there's only one way to him.  there's only one way to the father.  it's through jesus.  it's through putting your trust in faith in him to be your savior and that's the reason why you know us as as human beings.  we have been taught so many lies in the church and it's not your fault sometimes um having to unlearn that stuff.  you have to unlearn a lot of stuff That simply just wasn't true.  And, like, I was raised always thinking that, like, the path to heaven was narrow.  And you find it because it's all about being perfect or whoever.  Like, nobody really can know if they have eternal salvation.  You know, you just have to see at the end.  And you just got to be as good as you can be.  And, like, I never understood where holiness came from, where our righteousness came from.  I just never truly understood the full picture.  Like the gospel, the fullness of it.  I was saved as a little girl, but I never truly had that clarity.  And so, you know, the reason why the Lord says that the path to heaven is narrow and few find it and the road to hell or destruction is broad and many are on it is because there are so many people that are making... different ways to heaven.  They have their own way to get to heaven.  When Jesus says there's only one way to the Father, it's through jesus and his son and what he did on the cross for you.  and so there's a lot of people that are putting their trust in themselves.  um there's people that are out there preaching another gospel and you see it everywhere.  um you know the lord says that.  um he said if if you preach if you hear any other gospel other than i one other than the one that was preached to you it's to be a curse because there's literally only one way to the father.  and so i know i kind of went on like a little rabbit trail there with the gospel.  but you know how can you know that you're saved?  you know i just posted.  you know i was i was trying to make light of it on my community tab.  i posted a meme and i posted all of the scripture that talks about eternal security.  um being sealed with the holy spirit.  there's nothing you can do to lose your salvation.  okay and even when we we are faithless the lord remains faithful.  the bible tells us that.  so even though i was making light of it and if if you guys want to go back on my community tab and look at those verses um to uplift you you know the gospel is good news because we are in the dispensation of grace and it's it's when the Holy Spirit comes into you, he seals you and he starts a good work in you.  And so your desires will start to change.  You won't want to, um, a lot of people, you know, you won't want to live, you know, the way that you used to live.  And now you feel conviction from the Holy Spirit when you sin.  But, um, So anyways, if you guys want to go back and just look on my community tab and look at those scriptures, they are uplifting.  The gospel is good news because of everything that the Lord did for us.  You know, now we just have to put our trust and faith in him.  And so anyways, the Lord was just speaking to me like I could see, I could sense, like I could just sense the restrainer there, the Holy Spirit.  is still here upon the earth.  we as the body of christ.  um or we are we.  yeah we as the church the body of christ.  we are still here and i could just sense that peace and i just know that in the twinkling of an eye know things are going to change drastically.  there's going to be.  you think guys you think there's civil unrest.  now wait till the rapture happens.  people think there's only going to be a few taken.  i'm sure there's millions of christians out there who have put their trust and faith in jesus for their salvation.  um and so think about the chaos that's going to be here happening when the rapture happens.  you know loved ones gone um children gone just taken from their home and you know like the car crashes that happen and just there's going to be so much civil unrest that it's going to be very very chaotic.  um and so like.  not only that but just seeing how peaceful and calm the ocean was and the waves were and you could just see god's mercy still here um still in the world and his grace and his love and and not that that will ever go away.  but there's going to come a time during these seven years of tribulation that are upon us or upon the world.  you know if you're going to re you read revelations like revelations always as you say revelations it's revelation.  when you go and you read revelation you know it says um something like a mountain was thrown into the sea and i've seen that in my in my dream my dream of the second coming that the lord showed me.  if you guys are interested in seeing that um it's a few months back.  but um i saw like the tsunamis that were flooding into these big cities.  and um it's just.  i just want you guys to understand that we are in the end times we are in the final moments of the end of days and we are the fig tree generation.  and if you're struggling right right now like understanding that, then just seek the Lord on it and he'll give you full clarity.  And if you have turned your cheek to it because of fear, we'll just remember that fear comes from the enemy.  fear is not from the Lord.  there is no reason as a child of god why you should fear.  um if you have put your trust and faith in jesus christ that makes you worthy that makes you righteous.  okay because it's not our righteousness in the flesh that that gets us anything or anywhere.  jesus says that we are righteous through our faith in jesus christ and the.  the rapture of the church is called the blessed hope for all of those that believe.  because um it's not.  it's not about your good behavior it's not about what you do or what you don't do.  um you are going to escape you are not appointed to his wrath and you will get to go in the rapture when we when the trumpet blows and when it's time to go home okay so we're not.  we're not appointed to his wrath and there's no reason that you should fear.  um all of these things around us no matter how bad they seem to be and now no matter how bad they seem to be getting okay our trust and faith is in jesus alone and he's the only one that we should be trusting right now.  i was getting my uh vehicle on friday.  friday no sat.  saturday morning i was getting an oil change at one of the dealerships here and i was in the service department and there was.  they had a tv on and it was showing like just a civil unrest.  that was happening and the rioting and it's getting really really bad.  like it's not is a new normal.  but martin luther king iii came on and he said something that completely shocked me.  it shouldn't shock me it shouldn't come to us it shouldn't come to me as a surprise.  but he said if you're looking it look he literally.  this came out of his mouth and it even.  they even put the text up on the bottom.  he said if you're looking for a savior just look in the mirror.  okay um there is nothing that we can do to save ourselves.  and i know he wasn't talking about this.  okay but he was basically saying that if you're looking for a savior look to yourself like i know that change.  you know they say change starts with us.  but guys like that just it's.  it didn't sit well with me with the way that the world is going.  okay if you're looking for a savior you need to look to jesus christ because as things continue to progressively get even worse the only person that we can trust is jesus not ourselves not our own self-righteousness not our good behavior not our good works.  all those things are wonderful things and those things will naturally come when you.  because the bible says when you believe in the gospel of your salvation when you hear that truth when you receive it into your heart the holy spirit comes in in inside of you and seals you and makes you new and so everyone's works will look different.  okay so all those things are great things and will happen.  they're great but none of those things save you.  the only thing that saves you the only way is jesus christ.  um not politicians not ourselves not our president.  um not anybody but jesus all right.  well i love you guys.  it is starting to rain i'm probably going to pull up a little closer to the store but um i love you all so much.  um keep looking up.  um keep your focus on what's most important.  and when the fear and the anxiety starts to set in and the doubt and the confusion and um all of that just remember that that comes from the enemy that does not come from Jesus.  and if you're fearing the rapture right now if you're fearing if you have any fear right now ask jesus to replace that with joy and peace.  because i used to fear the rapture a a whole lot and i just simply leaned on the lord and i i rested in him and i just asked him to give me joy and give me peace.  and despite everything that's happening despite all the attacks against me i put my trust in jesus and i know that everybody always throws that around like let the the joy of the lord be your strength but seriously let the joy of the lord be your strength because when you're in him and you're in truth and you believe in the jesus and you You believe in the Jesus.  When you believe in Jesus and you put your trust and faith in him and you rest in him, there is nothing like the joy of the Lord, that true inner peace, that true inner joy that nobody can steal.  So anyways, I love you guys.  It is really starting to pour here.  I'm going to pull up closer and make a run for it.  All right.  Love you all.  Talk to you soon. ",
