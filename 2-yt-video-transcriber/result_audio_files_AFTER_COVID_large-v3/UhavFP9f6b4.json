And they're gonna roast the pigs alive in this sauna.  You can look in the barn and see the horrible conditions that they live in.  You see it and this is normal.  This is the industry that we have.  This is the industry that I've grown up around.  Iowa Falls, Hardin County, Hampton, Grundy County, everything around here that is Iowa Select, that is big pork.  Employee shutdowns caused massive backup.  No places to put these pigs.  Early talks kind of scared me about massive pig kill-offs of healthy pigs.  Pigs that now are being killed for no reason.  And the method to do that was through ventilation shutdown. ",
