            "text": "Reading people is the stuff that you thought your psychology class would teach you.  The ability to read, influence or persuade people at will.  Instead you found out that in class there were no real strong people reading techniques.  Let's be honest, world governments don't want to train their population to be more observant or cunning.  Reading people is the weapon of choice of the powerful and the elite.  You won't be able to easily lie to or manipulate a person who is good at reading people.  They can easily see you through everyone's intentions.  Being able to read a person is a must if you want to gain any significant power, as making a deal with the wrong person will significantly reduce your power.  Reading a person isn't as simple as looking at eye contact or body posture.  It runs much deeper than that.  If you want to be able to read, persuade, or even manipulate people successfully, you must nurture these six skill sets.  The first skill set is to master subtextual communication.  Your mind's perception for the unseen must be sharp.  You must understand people's words and actions on multiple levels.  Communication is multi-layered.  You should always understand what is being said, what is truly meant and what may possibly be implied.  To practice this, try and analyze the people around you.  This can be your friends, family or whoever.  You're just going to observe them.  Take notice of their words and much closer to their actions.  Try to figure out what their values are and what drives them.  Then predict their future moves.  Just like a poker player studies his opponent's every move, Every bluff he gets a sense of how that player thinks, to a point where he can accurately predict his opponent's next move.  Write down your targets and specify what they value.  For example, a very kind-hearted person may value honesty and integrity and inspires manipulators.  a loud extroverted person may value an introverted person who listens to him and despise other extroverts who talk over him.  when you understand what makes people tick you can manipulate them.  when you understand what makes you tick.  you know how you can be manipulated.

The average person is largely unaware of the underlying dynamics present in their environment, which is why the power hungry king appreciates the sleeping pawn.  Heightened powers of observation are deemed threatening despite being inherently passive in nature.  You may not wish to threaten another's interest.  But if the other person is aware of your strong observational power, they will find it hard to trust you, fearful in their paranoia that your skill could somehow expose them.  This is one of the many reasons the ability to appear unintelligent is useful and necessary, for it serves as the most effective form of concealment. ",

People who are good at reading people possess a high degree of self-control and do not easily become emotional.  They are open-minded to facts, logic and reasoning but close-minded to opinions.  Therefore, they are not easily manipulated by charm.  Their reasoning comes from analyzing data and facts.  To practice this, whenever you feel angry or irritated at someone, instead of lashing out, calm yourself down and do not act impulsively.  This might be hard to do at first, but with practice you can master your emotions.  Emotional reasoning leads to incorrect deductions, poor judgment and a loss of self-control. ",

To practice this, you can get into lighthearted banter with your friends, or you can just get into more debates with people.  Experience is key.  The fourth skill set, emotional intelligence.  Empathy is very important to develop emotional intelligence.  You must be able to put yourself in the other person's shoes.  You must be able to feel what they feel, think like they think.  To be able to fully become that person in a split second and embrace all their views.  People with low empathy cannot do this as they can only think from their own viewpoint.  When you are able to do this, you have immense power because you know exactly how the people who stand in your way think.  To quote Orson Scott, In the moment when I truly understand my enemy.  Then, in that very moment, I also love him.  It's impossible to really understand someone, what they want, what they believe, and not love them the way they love themselves.  And then, in that very moment when I love them, I destroy them.  The fifth skill set is cold reading.  You must develop the ability to cold read.  You can practice this ability by gathering data on a person and then making a theory as to what you have rationalized.  You can then find out by the person if what you have rationalized is true or not.  It's okay to make mistakes.  You learn by making mistakes. ",

            "text": "It is important to first gather enough data before you make a theory, because when you first make a theory without enough data your deduction will be unreliable.  For example, when you see a person wearing a sports jersey, you can rationalize that this person must like sports.  Instead the person could just like the jersey or someone got it for him at the present.  Therefore you must first gather enough data to make sure you make an accurate deduction.  Having the ability to make accurate generalizations about a person without even psychologically probing them gives you a massive advantage over those untrained in the reading of non-verbal cues.  A good book to learn cold reading is What Everybody's Saying, an ex-FBI's agent's guide to speed reading people.  The last skill set is superficial charm.  Reading people requires constant infield analysis and calibration.  Every interaction you have should have meaning to it.  In your conversations, you should be summing people up and collecting information on them so that you may better understand their nature.  If you can do this, you can calibrate your demeanor to their tastes and successfully socialize with a diverse range of characters.  Charm is necessary for comfort and comfort is necessary for trust.  And without trust, your options are limited.  To practice this, when you are meeting someone, mirror their behaviors.  Remember the fastest way to get trust from someone is to mirror them. ",
