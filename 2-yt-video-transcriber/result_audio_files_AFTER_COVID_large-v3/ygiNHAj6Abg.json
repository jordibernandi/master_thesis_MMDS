            "text": "Hello there and welcome to The Bunker.  I'm Lloyd Evans and in this video we absolutely must talk about the JW.org FAQ section.  Now this is a part of the JW.org website that I have already devoted an entire video to back in February of 2019.  I had the honour of being joined by Cliff Henderson, aka Fifth, a dear friend of mine.  Together, myself and Cliff went through the JW.org FAQ section and came up with 14 clear examples of lies and dishonesty.  Now, this was by no means an exhaustive list, I think in order to fact-check everything on JW.org's FAQ section, you would need more than just one video.  Nevertheless, we made a start.  And in this video, well, you can consider this video to be an addendum to that list.  We have... Example number 15, and credit for this must go to Reddit user DarkDesertOars.  I think that's how you pronounce the name.  Very menacing name there.  But DarkDesertOars came up with a beauty on the XJW subreddit, which you should all check out and be members of if you can.  The title was, I think I just caught them red-handed.  The first image is from the Watchtower Study article for this weekend.  And the second image is from the Frequently Asked Questions article made for the public.  The contradictions never end.  Let's first of all take a look at the JW.org FAQ section.  Am I expected to become one of Jehovah's Witnesses if I study the Bible with them?  You're contacted by one of Jehovah's Witnesses.  They start leaving you literature and visiting regularly.  In their minds, where they're trying to take this, where they're trying to steer you is towards a Bible study.  And really the whole point of a Bible study is to turn you into, surprise, surprise, a Jehovah's Witness.  But that's not the impression you get from reading this FAQ section.  Am I expected to become a JW?  No.  You are not obligated.  Notice how they've changed from expected to obligated.  Those are two different words, clearly.  You are not obligated in any way.  Millions enjoy our Bible study program without becoming Jehovah's Witnesses.  The purpose of the program is to show you what the Bible teaches.  What you decide to do with that knowledge is up to you.  We recognise that faith is a personal matter.  So the answer there to the question, am I expected to become a Jehovah's Witness if I have a Bible study, is no.  They then give an evasory response, or they expand on it in an evasory way by changing expected to obligated, And then they say that the purpose of having a Bible study is just to learn more about the Bible.  It's just to learn more about what the Bible teaches.  With all that in mind, let's go to this Watchtower paragraph, which Dark Desertors has brought to our attention.  Notice the question for the paragraph is, why should we talk about Christian dedication and baptism with our student?  So student being person who is studying the Bible with us.  Answer, talk openly about Christian dedication and baptism.  After all, our goal in conducting a Bible study is to help a person become a baptised disciple.  So notice how in the FAQ section it said, well, the aim is just to, I don't know, help people learn more about the Bible.  Here it's saying our goal is to help a person become a baptised disciple.  Our goal is to turn them into a Jehovah's Witness.  Within a few months of having a regular Bible study, and especially after beginning to attend meetings, the student should understand that the purpose of the Bible study is to help him start serving Jehovah as one of his witnesses.  Completely different explanation given to rank and file witnesses than what's being given to non-witnesses who go on JW.org wanting to know what's what.  It's hoodwinking, isn't it?  It's just flat-out deceiving people.  And notice how even in the paragraph, even if we take this paragraph in the Watchtower at face value, it's still describing deception.  Within a few months of having the study, the student should know what the purpose is.  Shouldn't they know what the purpose of the Bible study is when they agree to it?  When they start it?  Wouldn't that be... A good point at which someone understands what it is they're doing.  But here, very clearly, witnesses are being told, no, it's, don't let them know straight away, give it a few months.  At least by the point they start attending meetings, the penny should drop that this is all about converting them into the religion.  So I just found that a brilliant find by DarkDesertAws there on Reddit.  Again, if you're not already on the XJW subreddit, I highly recommend it.  You will find plenty of brilliant finds like this and people sharing their stories.  It's just a great community, really, for people who really want to see what the true nature... of Jehovah's Witnesses is all about.  But that's all I have for you in this video.  Don't forget to subscribe to the Lloyd Evans channel for more such videos.  And as always, thank you for watching.  Oh, it's a love I found from the top of the world But it's finally over, finally over.  I've got a last one minute just to get our lives.  So I keep it together, thinking it's not forever. ",
