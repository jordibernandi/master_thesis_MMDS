            "text": "the degree to which a woman exhibits negative qualities to her mate both in long-term relationships and more importantly marriage varies though all will partake in some capacity.  these displays factor in many variables from upbringing and the relationship of her parents sexual marketplace value and partner count to the culture at large and the specific values of her local community that she engages with.  All of these quantifiable values coalesce into a convenient package shrouded in sexual appeal, relying on man's lust to blind him to the realities that govern her future potential.  Masculine men with the hunter mentality often see the act of their domestication by women as a triumph on her part that she was good enough to tame him, to change his ways.  instead he has offered himself up as prey slowly but surely being drained over time by the real domesticated predator.  man in all his hubris becomes a withered shell of his former self not to the passing of time but the company he surrounds himself with.  only once he realizes this can he awaken from his slumber and only then can he exist within his waking nightmare aware of the fact and yet helpless to change it powerless to get back the time he lost living a lie.  Women can exhibit some of these negative qualities consciously or unconsciously.  A good woman would minimize these negatives to the best of her ability, but they will always be present.  A bad woman would not only not work to minimize these negative qualities, she would also work to capitalize on them for her own gain.  It is often these bad women that leave such a scar on the impressionable man's heart, but a deeper and more well-rounded understanding of female nature will create the infinitely deeper impression of knowing that even well-intentioned women are unable to fully restrain their own nature for it is something far-reaching beyond any of their capabilities.  a prime example of a negative quality that is demonstrated over a length of time is the reshaping of the man either against the man's will with his cooperation or a gradual change that goes unnoticed for so long that once he has been made aware, it is too late.  You can see this in the man's physical form for a visual representation.  Think to any man of great physical stature that you know, or perhaps even think to yourself in a previous relationship.  men who would toil away building their bodies as single men slowly but surely lose their gains and recede into a less disciplined state.  this is especially true for men without such discipline to begin with this physical reshaping through lethargy distraction or additional burdens can be exhibited both consciously and unconsciously.  Women who find themselves threatened by their mate's sexual marketplace value will work to lower it to provide additional security in their eyes in the relationship and to elevate her in the power dynamic.  Unconsciously, the simple act of female neediness can wear a man down over time if he is not vigilant of his priorities.  This physical reshaping is but a surface level assessment as the much more damaging and lasting changes are occurring beneath the body.  The man's values and character defining qualities begin to shift over time to accommodate her values and characteristics.  what once would be hard boundaries for him begin to erode and morph into simple preferences as his time and investment into the relationship begins to shackle him to it.  old friends become third wheels exploration and growth become liabilities hobbies and crafts become luxuries.  Career mobility becomes a distant oasis on the horizon, just out of reach thanks to its ball and chain.  Intimacy is used as a primary weapon and this is a constant conscious effort because it is her one and only means of securing what her femininity demands of her.  While men can lose attraction to a woman over time from the familiarity or to the passing of time and the production of children, a great deal of men connect on a deeper spiritual level and can maintain their intimate desires for their partner.  For many men, the great bait and switch has left them damaged and slow to recover.  A woman entertains their wildest fantasies, but once the marriage has been secured, her personality changes, her body changes from weight gain, and the intimacy they once enjoyed now becomes stagnant and creates the dead bedroom, where the man has all of the responsibilities and none of the perks.  a well versed man may be able to tangle with a feminine predator but just like those who would seek to tame natural predators from the wild eventually they get bit.  what then is the answer to this age-old question?  what should a man do with himself if not offer himself up to his domesticated predator on a silver platter?  if we were to consider the resilience of a man set on his ways he may say that these negative repercussions discussed and others are simply the cost of doing business with women that there are more important things in life namely children and the creation of a genetic legacy than worrying about his own wants and desires.  To that I would say good luck and godspeed.  Take what you can about our discussions and observations on female nature and use that to help you in your quest.  Make no mistake that undertaking is fundamentally, at its core, a lifelong quest, because you will be tasked with sorting through the depraved and ravenous hordes of corrupted feminine predators for a woman with a decent background, goals, and temperament with which you could even consider building something.  After which you have to constantly remain vigilant against the corrupting nature of the decadent culture, not only for the woman, but for any children you might have.  What good are the sacrifices you would make if it all falls apart in under a decade and your children end up being raised by a single mother?  if that is his goal i won't deny him the possibility of success.  i would say to that man to examine how he would permanently change and morph into something that would be unrecognizable to him today but a reality tomorrow if he underestimates his mission.  And what about the pragmatic man?  The man who looks around at his society, his neighbors, his potential mates, and honestly reflects at the state of things and either wishes to save his energy or simply can't find anything that can fit his standards that aren't debased creatures from the bowels of hell, birthed from the jaws of feminism that have clamped its jaws on the civilized world.  To that man, I would say to acknowledge that you face something relatively uncommon throughout history.  towards the end of every great civilization in its twilight years the individual rises above the family unit and prospers because cultures become engorged in their own success and lose sight of traditions that built those same empires to begin with.  Where before men fought with purpose, you may now find yourself without the same clear purpose that your ancestors had.  Instead of focusing on what you may have lost, come to terms with the severity of the danger you've saved yourself from and use that newfound gift of perspective to reshape your path. ",
