Part one, strong conflict of interest rules so that government officials are not profiting from taxpayer bailout money.  Part two, a ban on political spending by any corporation that is receiving bailout money from the federal government.  Part three, strengthen the Congressional Oversight Board and give it subpoena power so it can truly do its work.  And part four, Any giant corporation that wants to take federal bailout money needs to be willing to put workers on the board of directors.  There's going to be another stimulus package, and I'll be fighting for more accountability.  Join us at ElizabethWarren.com. ",
