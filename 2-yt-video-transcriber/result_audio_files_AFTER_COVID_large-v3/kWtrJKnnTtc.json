            "text": "Hello Scaredy Cats, it's me, Scaredy Matt.  I would like to talk about the 2019 Spanish film The Platform, which I think is a great movie that you should watch because I'm going to drop some big ol' spoilers here, but some content warnings if you decide you do want to watch it.  There is some implied sexual assault, there's a really cute dog that gets brutally killed, and the whole movie is violent as hell, which honestly I personally enjoyed because I'm a depraved goblin, but you might find it distasteful.  Also, one dude gets his face pooped on, you've been warned.  From this description, you might think that this movie is a senseless gore fest, but it's actually a nuanced critique of punitive justice and the way that the poor are incentivized to work against their best interests under capita- Ooh, okay.  I'm trying not to get too political here.  Look, this is my goofy horror movie channel.  I got a whole other YouTube channel to alienate people with my politics.  I try to make this channel a place where we can just kind of cut loose and have a little bit of fun, you know?  It's all about fun.  Silly movies.  But I want to talk about a particular fun silly movie, and this particular fun silly movie is very political.  There's always a temptation when looking at media to ignore the political dimension, to pretend as though it's a surface-level fun idea that doesn't have anything to say or isn't trying to put forth a real-world message.  That would be doing this film, and probably any film, a disservice.  All art is political, and while you can enjoy a movie despite its politics, that doesn't mean they aren't there or that I shouldn't talk about them here on Scaredy Cats.  But also I'm a great big stinky commie and I want to have a YouTube channel where I talk about horror movies and like.  I don't want to alienate the people that don't agree with me politically because the people that do agree with me politically make up like a percent of a percent of the population.  So I don't know what I'm gonna do.  The Platform is a movie with a deceptively simple premise.  What did I read?  Why did I emphasize the fact that it's a movie?  Why did I read the sentence like that?  The Platform is a movie with a deceptively simple premise.  It's about a prison that's hundreds of stories tall with a hole descending down the entire way.  A platform loaded with all sorts of tasty food is lowered from the top to the bottom, and each person can eat as much as they want, which means that the people at the bottom naturally get less food than the people at the top.  Once a month, the prisoners are gassed and transferred to a new random floor of the prison.  It's not quite clear why the prison is designed this way.  Perhaps it's some sort of cube.  But the movie heavily implies that it's a social experiment, designed to find out if people at the top can develop a spontaneous solidarity with the people at the bottom.  Will they stop their overconsumption in order to share with the people who have nothing?  Could they ever be expected to do that?  Like, say, if you were a very rich country and there was a lot of really poor countries.  Or maybe you're just a very rich person.  Like, as a hypothetical example here, just off the top of my head, maybe one person had like a hundred billion dollars and many other people, like a lot of people, like millions of people, had less than that, had like no dollars.  Could you be expected to spontaneously develop compassion for them and act outside of your immediate self-interest to help them?  A pure hypothetical.  Not at all analogous to the real world whatsoever.  It's all just a science fiction flight of fancy.  And boy, it sure seems like?  the answer to that question within this movie is nope.  The people at the top act hostile towards the people on the bottom, spitting on the platform as it descends, and in one memorable instance, pooping on a guy's face.  Those far below are driven to extreme acts of brutality to survive.  Murder, cannibalism, auto-cannibalism, really just murder and cannibalism.  Even after experiencing life at the lower levels where no food is available, once they're moved to the top, people remain unsympathetic to the needs of the people below them, and resist any attempts by goody-two-shoes meddlers to get them to act in solidarity.  They're at the top now, and it's their right to eat as much as they want.  Nobody saved food for them when they were at the bottom, so why should they save food for people now?  The same people who used to be at the top and treated them like garbage.  as far as they know, f*** you, got mine.  There are some people that try to help.  One lady worked for the company that designed the prison and decides she wants to enter the prison to get people to see reason because, oh yeah, I just Plot device.  also, you don't have to be charged with a crime to get into the prison.  You can also volunteer in exchange for payment or college credit.  Anyway, she volunteers and she tries to tell people to ration food, but the thing is, she's, you know, kind of condescending to people beneath her.  Do you think, Karen, that nobody thought of that?  Do you think it never occurred to anyone that you could just ration food so everybody got some?  Do you think you're going to outsmart this whole operation on day one of you being here when nobody else managed to do that?  for however many years this prison has been going?  Another guy tries to climb all the way to the top so he can deliver a message to the people running the prison, or I don't know, kill them or whatever.  I don't know exactly what his plan is.  He believes God chose him to do it.  I don't know what he wants to do.  Anyway, some people help him, but inevitably, each month he runs into some people who decide they don't give a shit and stop him from progressing.  Eventually, some characters decide to stage a revolt where they descend on the platform to hand out food to make sure everybody only takes what they need, but their brutal punitive approach makes them not much better than the people who made the prison in the first place.  And they can only really achieve success when they reach out to people in true solidarity rather than a solidarity imposed from above through the threat of violent retribution.  The only real salvation can be achieved from the bottom up by lifting up the powerless rather than submitting to the benevolently intentioned rule of those at the top.  There's a reason that there is no spontaneous solidarity.  It's because the system of the prison incentivizes everyone to only care about their own needs.  In the movie The Platform, I am not talking about real life, I am talking about the fictional scenario in the film The Platform, and nothing else.  The people at the top are only secure temporarily.  Once the next month rolls around, who knows where they're gonna be?  Who knows if they'll be able to eat?  Once the platform descends, they can't see the people below them.  They don't have to look people in the eye when they take food from them.  Nobody knows how far down the prison even goes, nobody knows how many people are trapped inside, so nobody knows if there's even enough food to go around anyway.  It might be that you could go hungry trying to protect the people at the bottom from starving, but there's not enough for everyone to eat, so no matter what, you end up with some hungry people.  Besides, you don't even know the people on other levels.  You have the same cellmate every month unless they die or you kill them.  And everyone else, all the people on either side of you, are switched out once a month.  You don't get a chance to build community.  You never have to put a face to the people below you, or above you for that matter.  You're completely atomized and put into a survival scenario where your interests seem to conflict with people.  you are kept from getting to know.  That's the mistake that the people above make when they try to condescend downwards.  It's not that it hasn't occurred to anyone to be selfless.  It's that they don't know if they can afford to be selfless, and they don't even know that if they could, it would work anyway.  The material conditions of their lives, which have been designed by an untouchable and undemocratic force, have created a system whereby people are incentivized to screw each other over once again.  This is all a discussion about the movie The Platform, and that's all it's a discussion about.  The entire experiment sets forth from a faulty premise.  It isn't testing whether spontaneous solidarity will emerge.  It's testing to see if people's natural solidarity is powerful enough to overcome a system engineered to counter it.  Can people still be generous when their lives are on the line?  Will people care about one another when they're kept from ever seeing or knowing about one another's suffering?  Within a system like that, it would appear that people are naturally cruel and selfish.  But every character we actually follow in the story, every single one we actually spend any time with and understand the motivations of, seems at least partially inclined to help others.  Even the villainous old man who ties up the main character to eat bits of him chooses not to kill him, partially because that means the guy would rot and he would lose his food, but partially, you know, because he doesn't want to be a murderer.  If he were truly selfish, if he were truly uncaring, he'd do whatever it took to protect himself, even if it meant killing his cellmate.  He's driven to the cruelty of cutting off bits of his cellmate by starvation and paranoia, both of which are cultivated by the system he lives within.  But even he, a standoffish and selfish jerk who seemed like a real asshole even before he wound up in the prison, even he tempers his cruelty and self-interest ever so slightly for the common good.  It's easy to assume the prison is full of erstwhile cruel people, that the few good characters we meet are the exceptions that prove the rule that people are naturally cruel and self-interested.  But, if we looked at the main characters from the outside, we might conclude the same things about them.  It isn't a question of whether or not people are naturally kind or cruel.  That's the wrong thing to ask.  People aren't naturally anything.  We're shaped by our environment.  If our environment promotes kindness, we will be kind.  If it promotes cruelty, we will be cruel.  That's why we have to be careful about cultivating the correct environment, an environment that allows each person to flourish, to self-actualize, to be the best versions of themselves.  Solidarity doesn't emerge spontaneously.  Solidarity is built.  It is built by hard work and dismantling systems of oppression.  I guess what I'm saying is, workers of the world unite.  We have nothing to lose but our chains.  Now is the time to-. ",
