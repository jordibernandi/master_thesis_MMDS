Joe Biden does not know what he's saying.  All right.  Now, so some reporters, not many.  What about that?  And the Biden camp says the former vice president accidentally cited the number of confirmed cases and deaths from Michigan.  So he mixed up Michigan with the military.  How can you do that?  How can you say that 6,114 military people died from COVID?  Do you not know anything?  He doesn't know what he's saying.  So while the corrupt anti-Trump press is parsing, parsing, playing it down, parsing it, okay?  The other presidential contender, Joe Biden, is spouting 30 seconds of absolute gibberish in a press conference.  And he doesn't even know it's gibberish.  He doesn't know.  It's not like he says, oh, I just made a mistake or maybe I'm misspeaking.  He uses the word 1,189,506.  What does that mean?  1,189,000.  He doesn't know the words that are coming out of his mouth.  Now, I'm not saying this to disparage Joe Biden.  Okay, I don't play that game.  I'm stunned that he could be the next president of the United States.  It's inconceivable that that a guy who literally does not know what he is saying in a press conference could become the most powerful man in the world.  I have never seen anything close to this in politics. ",
