            "text": "Forrest Johnson ends the benefits for migrants, the Brexit trade deal goes through parliament, and anti-CCP hackers infiltrate the Chinese government.  hello everyone and welcome to today's show.  after a whole season of doom and gloom and negativity we have some good news for you guys towards the end of the year so we can start 2021 with a more of an optimistic perspective.  and so brexit is almost done well officially.  uh leaving the transition period Now we're going to have to wait and see how this new relationship is going to work out.  But the good news that we have is that as Boris Johnson, the Department for Working Pensions and the Home Office promised, free movement is going to be finished on the 31st of December.  But one of the biggest manifesto pledges was also to end the benefits that economic migrants receive.  And that is finally going to happen as well.  According to the Mail, the government have now fully announced that as of the 1st of January, migrants that are coming to the UK after New Year's Day won't actually receive benefits for five years which is the most logical view that we could have on this because you want people to actually be able to come here.  firstly good quality migrants with their talents and something that they could actually contribute to the society and contribute first and then if they want to receive any support from the state, just like any other normal citizen in this country, then fine.  But you don't want to attract a certain type of people who just come here to take advantage of the system.  Now, workers won't receive child benefits for children living outside of the UK either.  Now, this has been one of the weirdest things that we had in our system as a policy, where migrants were able to receive benefits for relatives, people who are not actually in this country, which defeats the whole purpose of If you're moving here, you're moving here.  You're going to embrace the new system, the new country, the new culture, but that hasn't really been the case.  Now, this is going to be changing a lot of things.  So, at this point, considering the free movement is going to be finished in a couple of days, well, tomorrow, all migrants will be treated equally, whether they're from Europe or not, or the EU, essentially.  And Theresa Coffey, who's the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, has confirmed that the child benefits rules.  it was actually the most unfair policy that we had because you know again we have people in this country who are suffering people who are in need of support and you know we still have problems with homelessness and food banks are still rising.  and then we were just giving out free benefits to everybody else who just randomly come into this country and so that has to obviously change.  now Tracer Coffee has said that Newersday will see the end of re-movement and fairer benefits rules coming into force for the new EU migrants.  A point-based immigration system will come into effect.  Migrants from the continent will have to speak English and have a job offer.  Low-skilled immigration will become virtually impossible.  I think that's always been the other problem that we had.  It wasn't just those who were coming here simply to seek benefit.  It was also the low-skilled migration that had a massive impact on certain communities in this country.  So that also is going to be, according to Tracer Coffee, virtually impossible to do because they have to be able to speak English properly, they need to have a proper job offer and the point-based system will force them to have proper jobs, not just a random job that we could just give to our own people in this country.  Now, If this situation is resolved, we still have one more problem, and that's the illegal migrants that are coming to this country, especially from France on the boats.  Now, Priti Patel has also confirmed that she's changing the international arrangements on that at the same time.  Again, if this comes to effect as well, then we're going to see a situation where we fix the problem with the legal side of migration, but also the illegal side.  This will, I'm guessing, still take some time because the Home Office are so bureaucratic and incompetent.  But at the same time, at least the policy is now in place.  So we'll have to judge Priti Patel's department when it's fully approved.  So we'll have to kind of wait for that.  But the good news is that that's also changing.  But as you guys always say in the comment section, we'll leave it when we see it.  So that's the latest update on this issue.  Brexit and the trade deal went through Parliament today.  At the time of me making this video, they're still voting, but it should be finished by now.  The Labour Party can't even manage themselves.  Zakir Starmer wanted to be a strong manager for his MPs, but nope, he's still got a bunch of Labour MPs, Remainers, who are rebelling against the trade deal in favour of no dual Brexit.  In the last couple of days, we've talked a lot about Brexit.  the Remainers in Parliament who are suddenly pro-no-deal Brexit.  So I'm not going to talk too much about that.  I'm just going to point out a number of issues with certain Labour MPs, people who are, you know, so-called credible MPs with good reputation for the left.  People like Ben Bradshaw, who, you know, on the 1st of May 2019, he said, I've never abstained on Brexit and never shall.  So, you know, whether he was going to be voting for or against Theresa May's deal back then, and then the new withdrawal agreement with Boris Johnson, and then the trade deal, you know, at least he always has a position.  He's not like Sir Keir Starmer sitting on the fence.  But is it true?  Because last night, yesterday, he tweeted, I'm abstaining.  This is the problem we have.  The reason I'm mentioning this, a lot of people might say, well, who cares?  The constituents of Ben Bradshaw should care.  People who elect these people should care.  And, you know, a lot of ex-MPs have these weird views, like Lord Adonis and others, or ex-politicos like Alistair Campbell, but the existing public servants You're holding public office.  You've been elected by people in this country.  Have some respect.  Now, speaking of respect, Ian Blackford, the leader of the Scottish Nationalist Party in Westminster, or as he's obsessed with correcting everyone, is the Scottish National Party.  He had a massive row with Boris Johnson today about the name of his party, considering we don't have enough time today to debate and scrutinise the actual bill and vote on it.  He spent a bunch of the time to actually just waste it by discussing the name of his party.  Why don't you point out to the Prime Minister that the name of my party is the Scottish National Party?  In fairness, I have pointed it out in the past.  It is the Scottish Nationalist Party.  Prime Minister.  Mr Speaker, I wish the right honourable gentleman would know that I'm using the word nationalist with a small n. And I don't think that he would disagree with that, which is semantically justifiable, I think, under the circumstances.  I'm really not sure if that was necessary in terms of the timing of Parliament.  to actually just rant about that, but that's Ian Blackpool, we don't really care.  Let's talk about the negative impact of Brexit, how it's going to be bringing everything down, the housing market is going to crash, you know, since 2016, or has it?  Oh, apparently not, because the BBC reported today that UK house prices see the highest growth in six years this year in 2020.  So the housing market crashed.  that remain as predicted in 2016.  Initially they said the crash will happen immediately after the vote in 2016.  Then they said when we leave the EU last year, and then now they said, you know, the end of the transition period, none of it has actually happened.  And I'm going to explain why, because we've got the facts and figures in this video.  Firstly, it actually reports that the prices have now climbed 7.5% in 2020.  This is the highest growth rate for six years, according to Nationwide.  And prices ended the year 5.3% above the level.  I mean, especially back in the beginning of the year, in March, when the lockdown started, was a lot of uncertainty.  a lot of it's affected the rent prices especially in london.  but when you look at the long-term effect of brexit because we have the actual graph that nationwide has produced uh over the last 12 to 14 years you can see that after the 20 2008 crash the prices massively collapsed and then it came back up and it already came into government and it's been quite a uncertain and not really stable.  2016.  And when the Brexit vote happened, the prices slowly started going down.  And, you know, tried to come back up just a bit.  But generally speaking, they were in decline.  And remainers always said that this is going to be the effect of Brexit.  Just UK being independent, being outside the EU, that's always going to be happening.  Everything's going to crash.  In reality, this is proving them wrong because 2020, beginning of 2020, when we left the EU officially, and now that we have the transition period, the prices are coming up again.  And that just proves that the reason the decline happened wasn't because of independence.  It was simply because of the uncertainty of the negotiations between 2016 and 2019 or 2020.  The market just didn't know what was happening.  And that's all thanks to Theresa May and the European Union messing up the Brexit talks.  So don't blame the concept of Brexit.  And obviously prices going up is bad and good.  It's bad because young people, first-time buyers are going to struggle.  The good news is it's a sign of a healthy economy at this point.  We just need to sort out the stocks when it comes to housing.  So that's a whole different problem that the government should fix and they haven't in the last few decades.  Now, moving on from this, the European Union, speaking of Brexit, yesterday we reported that China and the EU are signing a new alliance, an investment pact to trade and to start cooperating on security and technology and be best friends.  Today, they had a Zoom video call, the EU officials and leaders with the Chinese president and the Chinese government.  So Ursula von der Leyen had the Chinese flag and the EU flag in the background.  And you had Merkel doing the same thing, Charles Michel.  The one person that didn't do that was Emmanuel Macron.  He refused to have the Chinese flag in the background next to the French flag and the EU flag.  He also actually had the French flag because Angela Merkel didn't have the German flag.  And obviously, Charles Michel and President Macron Rwanda and don't really have flags, so they just go with the EU one.  Macron actually put the French flag and the EU flag and said, no, not doing this.  According to the palace in Paris, they're saying that Macron is not happy about this, but because he's passionate about keeping Europe together and he's a federalist, he still wants to have a seat at the table to make sure that this deal doesn't get worse than it currently is.  So he's not going to actually salt and not turn up.  A lot of people were asking about this, saying, well, he hasn't put the flag up, but he's still at the meeting.  It's because he still wants to have control.  Otherwise, it will be Merkel and von der Leyen taking charge of the whole thing.  But that was his protest to this... zoom meeting with the flags so the flag gates.  macron wins uh.  and speaking about of uh.  the chinese communist party.  anti-chinese hackers have managed to infiltrate their um the app that they have the data center.  so they got this system where they started doing this um essentially an id centralized system where they want to collect all the data because of what happened in 2020, but that was just an excuse.  Obviously, they want to have control over people's personal information.  Apparently, this HealthKit, which is kind of like the NHS app, but slightly scarier and more authoritarian, Their security is not the best, because hundreds of millions of citizens, their data have been compromised after hackers found that the information could be accessed with only the victim's name and their national ID number, which is easy to find.  Now, this security flaw is going to cause a lot of troubles.  Now, I'm going to explain why what the hackers did is good and bad, because the incidents as underlined here, the lack of data security in China.  The company that developed the app told the state media that they weren't even aware of the loophole.  So this is the biggest problem that we have.  And I think I'm quite concerned because I'm glad that they did this to expose and to fight against it.  But my fear is, knowing the CCP and how authoritarian they are, they're going to make it worse now.  They're going to increase the security and actually become even more authoritarian as a result of this.  So, slightly concerning, but we'll probably have to keep an eye on this situation and report on this channel.  You guys, don't forget, tomorrow night, New Year's Eve, we have a special episode.  I'm going to look back at the year that we had with Laurence Fox, Isabella Oakshott and Brendan O'Neill.  They're going to join me and Lacey tomorrow.  So make sure to tune in then.  And I'm just going to go get ready for the second video, but also our daily video.  well currently daily zoom video calls with the members of the channel.  we are going to make this the video calls sessions with the members more regular but also i've received a lot of comments again about from people who have been unsubscribed by youtube.  So you have to double check every now and then when you watch the videos to make sure that you are subscribed.  And also click on the notification bell next to it and click on all.  Because if you click on the notification bell and if one day you don't get the notification, that means you've been unsubscribed.  So that's the best way to double check to see if you have been.  So always double check because YouTube have unsubscribed a lot of accounts randomly.  Not even sure why they're doing it, but that's happened.  Let's just say it's accidental.  Thanks again for watching.  I'm MyATC and I'll see you guys in the next video.  Thank you. ",
