            "text": "Hey everyone, welcome to the Lockdown Q&A with Diana Deveson, where I answer questions and discuss topics suggested in the comments of yesterday's video.  There were quite a few good ones, and I don't want to be rambling for too long, so I tried to group a few together.  If I don't answer your question, keep putting it in the comments below and I'll try to get to it tomorrow.  Dr.  Steve Brule asked about the Joe Biden Me Too accusation that came out this week.  Obviously, that's a hot topic given Biden's public position of believing all women in the past.  I'll put a link in the description to an article in Reason that covers the details of the accusation.  for those who haven't seen it yet.  Of course, this is not the first problem that Biden's encountered.  There's a parody website full of videos of him touching and smelling the hair of females, both adult and child.  But this time he's being accused of a full-blown sexual assault.  Notably, there has been practically zero mainstream coverage of the allegation.  I think this is the most important aspect to demand answers.  The media should not be permitted to pick and choose whose lives they want to destroy.  That hypocrisy needs to end.  Most hypocritical is that these character assassins calling themselves journalists usually claim to be champions of equality.  My position on historic allegations is that they're a few decades too late.  I don't think any historic allegations should be tried either in real courts or in the court of public opinion.  No accused person can answer to allegations after so many years have passed, and we need to put statutes of limitations back into all of our courts.  But from what I've seen in the past, the purpose of these allegations in places where the limitations have passed is that they'll try to launch a civil suit if they're called a liar, saying that it's defamation to call them liars.  That leads to the next question from Steve PXS about what sort of legal action can be taken against false accusers.  Every case is unique.  To have any chance at success, you have to look at the quality of your evidence that the accusation is a lie.  In civil court, you're looking at a balance of probabilities, and she'll likely counter sue defending against the defamation claim by insisting that the allegation is true.  This is still the case for someone who's been acquitted in a criminal trial.  As we know, acquittals are denounced by the public as a failure of the justice system, having too high a burden of proof.  If you go to civil court, the allegation will be revived and assessed on a lower standard.  Additionally, most judges would be looking for actual evidence of malice in a defamation suit.  The most important thing to consider, really though, is that a civil suit can take many years during which it's very difficult to move on and put the trauma of the false accusation behind you.  The choice to take legal action is also a decision to extend the trauma and continue to sink money into the legal system.  And in the end, even if you win, it's unlikely you'd get any significant money out of it, and we'll end up wondering what all that time and money was wasted on.  So that brings us to David Eliezer's question about Amber Heard.  Johnny Depp actually had audio recordings of Heard admitting to assaulting him and complaining that he always runs away from her.  He also has evidence that one of those assaults caused him bodily harm.  Mainly, one of his fingers was severed.  Because he's a celebrity, he also has witnesses that can verify parts of his story, as he had personal assistants and bodyguards.  Undepp is now suing Amber Heard for $50 million.  and, as the Daily Mail reports, a judge just dismissed her attempt to have the lawsuit thrown out.  I'll put a link to that article, and note that it also links to audiophiles of Heard admitting to being violent.  This will take a long time to go through the courts, but Heard seems to be maintaining that her allegations are true.  Because of how high profile the two of them are, I expect that even more damning evidence would come out at trial and that it'll be plastered across the media as the story evolves.  The question is whether or not this will help start national conversations about female violence.  Mainstream media doesn't seem to care about that issue, so it will likely fall to alternative media and legal activists to try to get the courts to finally start recognizing the gender bias that they unfairly hold against men in accusations of domestic violence.  So this case may be an opportunity at some point in the future.  There was a very popular question from someone calling himself constant incel who just can't get laid, asking what predatory women are going to do now that they can't use men for free food and drinks or cheat on their husbands.  This was similar to a question by Planet Frog about whether or not the pandemic will have an effect on issues like sex workers and dating apps, but I also want to connect it to a comment from Lloyd Gush about men being locked up with abusive women during the shutdown.  One of the first things that occurred to me when people were told to stay home and everyone is on lockdown is that there may be a surge in domestic violence accusations.  Some may be real and some not.  The courts are currently shut down, but are processing charges and doing bail hearings.  So accusations would still be processed through the courts right now.  It's very unfortunate that a lot of people stay in toxic relationships for a long time.  Quite often it's because of financial trouble or lack of resources.  Financial abuse was actually added to the list of forms of domestic violence, but of course only looking at when women claim that they're being abused in that way.  And with so many people losing their jobs, that financial stress, the cause of a massive number of domestic arguments, is going to be intensified.  For some people, the lockdown has given an opportunity to spend time with their families in a way that may have really positive long-term effects.  But for those who are in abusive relationships, both men and women, this pandemic could end up being disastrous.  The question of what predatory women are going to do now that they can't go out on dates is likely that they're going to just find another way to get their hands on other people's resources.  This shutdown will just make them more aggressive.  But to finish on a positive note... Sig Erther mentioned a graphic novel by artist Scott Beezer called Quantum Vibe.  Indeed, there is a character in that series that is loosely based on me, and Scott has done some of my channel art.  So go check out his website and get a copy of the print edition from last season.  Leave your questions and comments below, and I'll upload a new video tomorrow.  Stay well. ",
