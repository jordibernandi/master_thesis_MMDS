            "text": "There are three types of cultures.  One is based on law and guilt.  Another is based on honor and shame.  And the third is based on power and fear.  Law and guilt is very much descriptive of Western culture.  This is why the strongest institution in our culture are legal institutions.  You know, very highly paid people are lawyers.  We speak a lot about the rule of law.  And again, if you're from the West, you would think there's no other way to build a society, and this is the supreme way, this is the best way.  And that's where racial or cultural arrogance creeps in.  Because we ignore what two-thirds of the world, probably more than two-thirds, because the Western world is the smallest in population.  But let's just call it, suppose it's evenly divided.  It's not.  The rest of the world doesn't even follow this kind of society.  We care very much in the Western world about written policies.  So, again, if people say, you know, it's not in my job description, it's not written here, what are they saying?  I don't have to do anything for you.  Get out of here.  It's not written on this piece of paper, so stuff you.  Get out of my face.  This is the kind of thing that happens a lot in the West.  Because we're built on law and guilt.  We exert influence on people by guilt and by law.  The control comes that way.  And the rewards, I guess, come that way as well.  There's a whole different way to build society and life, and this would be, by population, the majority of the world.  By population, by far, the majority of the world.  It's called honor-shame culture.  Honor-shame culture describes all of Asian culture, Eastern culture, Middle Eastern culture, Arab culture.  It's called honor-shame culture.  In this kind of culture, it doesn't matter really what is written.  That isn't the issue.  What people value is politeness.  Politeness goes a long way in Asia.  Let's say that something is written that you can't have and you can't do, but you're very polite.  They say, just for you, it's okay, I'll take care of it.  You see?  In Asian culture, everybody here that's Asian here is nodding and smiling.  You know it's true.  Now, the West says that's lacking rule of law.  That's terrible.  You're not following the rules.  But you also are more relaxed and more relational and able to get things done because sometimes written law is too strict or too inhumane.  Life cannot be led just by strict, tight, rigid rules.  You will become pharisaical.  So Eastern culture has honor and shame, and that means that they value politeness.  Another thing they value a lot is hospitality.  Hospitality is unwritten, isn't it?  There's no law that says, I have to be hospitable to you.  It says, I must serve you three cups of tea.  It doesn't say that, does it?  Plus a biscuit.  Make that three.  No, it's unwritten hospitality.  But it's more important than what is written.  If you act hospitable, you will get the business deal.  Whereas a Westerner will come into an Arab country, Asian country, and start laying down the rules and the laws, and this is what you're going to get, and this is what I'm going to do for you, and then in the end they don't get the deal.  And they say they don't understand these Asians, these Easterners.  but you were not even hospitable.  So I think Western business people have learned to acclimate to this and change to this, and they realize, hey, you have business with an Asian, you're going to have to have a lunch or a dinner together and not talk about money right away.  It's a hospitable thing.  In honor-shame culture, relational credit matters.  It's not just the law.  It's not just that you're right, so you get your way.  You must have some relational credit with people.  This is honor-shame culture.  And the converse is, you know, if you want to get along with people, you have to really be careful about shaming people.  You must try to save face, protect their face.  So people unfortunately don't understand this.  Western culture, I'll give you an example.  Aussie is law-based culture.  And unfortunately, Western society always thinks that they're superior, they're better.  And so one time, there was a group of people, I think there was more than 10 people caught doing drugs.  And one of them was Aussie, Andrew Chan.  So the Aussies, the Aussie leaders, who are as thick as a brick, I must say, because if they had just come to Discover Church, I could have told them that this is wrong.  What they did was they put out a public statement against capital punishment.  Capital punishment is wrong.  Capital punishment is not right.  See how Westerners are?  It's all about right and wrong.  How dare you take an Aussie citizen and incarcerate him, judge him, and now you're going to execute him.  How dare you?  Now, they never think, even if you know nothing about different cultures, if you just think, let's just suppose that we caught a drug dealer in Springvale, and we put him to trial, and Indonesia sends a worldwide global announcement.  How stupid are the Australians that they're not killing this drug dealer?  In our country, we would execute this guy and we would stop the drug.  How stupid of Australians to not do that.  Imagine if Indonesians do that.  We would say, mind your own business.  We're not Indonesia.  Who are you?  We're Australia, mate.  So we're going to run our country the way we want to run our country.  So shut up!  That's exactly how Australians would treat an Asian imposing their value on Australia.  And yet they think nothing of imposing our Western value on another culture.  So not only is it so rude and so undiplomatic, it causes shame.  So we shame another culture that is based on honor and shame.  which meant Andrew Chan was going to get executed for sure.  Even if there was a plan to just honor Australia and say, everyone's been judged, everyone's going to be executed, but we want to honor you, Australia, as our partner, and say, Andrew Chan can be judged by you.  Asians would be very amendable to that.  But because you shamed the Indonesians, Andrew Chan was dead.  We Australians killed him.  And I know that's true because out of that group there was another foreigner, Filipino.  And the Filipino government said nothing publicly to anybody.  I'm sure it was a private call.  Sorry, huh?  Sorry, huh?  Can you do something for us?  We're so sorry.  It's okay.  We sent him back quietly.  And that's exactly what happened.  One of the Filipinos, I don't know male or female, if I recall correctly, I think it was a female, life was spared because the national leaders in the Philippines had the common sense to understand honor.  Honor will save your life.  Dishonor will kill you.  Dishonor will cause you to lose everything near and dear to you.  It matters so much in honor.  culture.  People care about protocol and etiquette.  Stuff that is not written down.  I'm not saying that this is a perfect culture.  There can be a lot of corruption in this culture.  There can be a lot of things that you may not understand and think is unfair.  And you would be right.  But then again, your culture is not superior just because you didn't grow up in this kind of society.  Because we are obsessed with the law, we are losing our sense of hospitality, our connection with people, what we owe each other.  that is unwritten.  We're losing relationship.  People feel lonely in Western culture, and it is a mental disorder.  in Western culture, that people are depressed, and yet they want more rules and more laws and more programs, not realizing that was the very thing that undercut the relationship.  Christians shame each other not only publicly, not only online, they do it to each other in court.  They throw false accusations against each other.  And there's a whole chapter in the Bible, in the New Testament, about this in 1 Corinthians 6.  Dare you do this.  Dare you bring each other to court.  But pastors today that I know in the Western world say, get lawyered up.  Get legal advice.  Do what the lawyers tell you.  The only way to resolve it in our Western society is by law.  We are trapped to one mode of doing culture.  And most people cannot think outside the box, so we are trapped in a legalistic culture.  And you're going to come across legal problems at some point in a Western world.  You can live all your life, even get married, get divorced, have a business breakup, and never once appear in court in the Asian world.  Isn't that right?  A lot of Asians know.  They're so surprised that... Westerners routinely, regularly waste their money on expensive lawyers and waste their time in court. ",
