But police are now fining her for not showing the exemption that she didn't have to show.  They think we're stupid.  They've just tracked her down, not even at her house, by the way, at her ex-partner's home to harass and intimidate the single mother after the footage of her unlawful arrest went viral.  This is not about mask compliance.  They obviously don't care about that.  Heck, you saw, he didn't even wear a mask when he initially went to apologize, let alone now to find her.  Understand what's really happening here.  They are now trying to justify unlawfully arresting and assaulting her in front of their children.  You see, apologizing was an admission of guilt, meaning he was admitting to having no reason to place her under arrest and searching her, which technically means he had assaulted her.  Now they're just back to cover his ass.  Finding her, they think, suddenly justifies his assault.  It doesn't.

I did note that at the time of her arrest and also at the time when they served the fine, they did not or were not wearing protective gear, masks, gloves, etc.  And, you know, it's one of those situations where she was very cooperative.  She'd given them what her excuse actually is.  And there was absolutely no reason whatsoever for her to be detained or fined.
