One is the impact on our health, the way the epidemic changes our lives, the isolation, the setting, normal activities, the fear of illness.  But at the same time there is the epidemic that is spreading in the political economy of global capitalism.  Undoubtedly, the coronavirus will accelerate the crisis after 2008.  Don't let anyone tell you that this crisis has come to an end and we now have a new one.  The 2008 crisis never ended.  It has changed in different forms.  It spread from one continent to another and took on different forms.  But still it was always there.  The world has never returned to a kind of balance after 2008.  Capitalism has become a completely different thing since the time before 2008.  What the coronavirus has done is the deepening and acceleration of the non-ending, uninterrupted crisis that began in 2008.  If you think about it, the reason for this was that after 2010 and 2011 there seemed to be a normalization, a relaxation, that the central banks and the governments took it upon themselves to restart the financial markets and rebuild the cycles of financed capital by printing billions and billions of money and throwing it to companies that already had a lot of money, to 0.1%.  Take Apple, Google and so on.  They borrow, for example, free money from the Federal Reserve in the United States to buy back their own shares.  The only thing that comes out of it is that it massively increases inequality, stabilizes the financial markets, but at the same time decimates all serious investments in high-quality jobs, in the labor market, health, education, in the green change that this planet urgently needs.  So when COVID-19 arrived in the city, When Covid-19 emerged, it hit a global capitalism, which depended on a gigantic bubble of private debt, which had been shaped by the central banks in the name of financial capital.  The problem is that the stock exchange goes up and down.  Every catastrophic collapse of the stock exchange can easily lead to a remarkable uptrend, the indices go through the roof.  But even if the central banks of the world, the Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan, The Bank of England, the European Central Bank, even if they manage to restart capitalism as they did in 2008 and 2009, that will not bring us back to where we were before Covid-19.  And that for a very, very simple reason.  Covid-19 has crushed the bubble on which financial capitalism has so far rested.  Even if the financial markets have recovered, the level of investment will be even lower than it was a few months ago. ",

            "text": "let's not forget that the level of investment a few months ago, especially in important things, in things that humanity needs, in raw materials, in green energy and so on, so that the level of investment in relation to available liquidity in the form of savings was never lower than before the coronavirus.  Imagine what it will be like afterwards.  Now, what protection mechanisms does financial capitalism have today compared to 2008?  This comparison between 2008 and 2020 is quite comprehensive.  In 2008, two things saved global capitalism.  The Federal Reserve, the Central Bank of the United States, and China.  Of course, the governments in Europe, the International Monetary Fund and so on, did a lot later to complete the work that the FED and China had started, by carrying gigantic amounts of losses from the private banks on the shoulders of the weakest taxpayers.  We at DiEM25 believe with socialism that not the mass of many citizens carries the hard savings plans, but also all the few, the bankers, who should have their share of it.  But it was China and the FED who, as supporting pillars, kept the financial capitalism alive.  These two pillars are broken today.  The coronavirus has its origin in China.  It damaged the ability of the Chinese political economy to generate excesses.  It came to the closure of factories, to the reduction of the growth rate below zero, and it has caused exactly the opposite of what happened in the 2008 financial crisis.  China is not able today to do what has to be done to meet the overall demand in Germany, in the Netherlands, in Japan and in the United States.  China is now a patient, not a doctor anymore.  The US Notenbank could repeat this great achievement of the year 2009, because the US Notenbank in 2009, without many knowing it, expanded the interest rates on exchanges with the dollar, so-called swaps, on the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan, as well as the Bank of England and many other central banks.  In a sense, the Federal Reserve assured them that it would give them as much money as they needed to cover their expenses for the broken bets on the dollar. ",

They could do this again now.  But there are two problems.  First, as I said, this will not restore capitalism's ability to invest in important things and high-quality jobs.  This ability will even go down compared to the ridiculously low level that we had before the coronavirus.  But there is another problem, namely Donald Trump in the White House.  Will Mr.  Trump look like the Federal Reserve, Germany, the European Central Bank, Japan and China, if necessary, offers new interest rates for dollar swaps?  I am very afraid that he will try to link the conditions to it.  It sounds like a technical issue.  It's not a technical issue. ",

We will experience an even deeper crisis, an even deeper recession with noticeable effects on the lives of people from Hong Kong and Shanghai to Finland, Portugal and Iceland.  Everywhere.  That is why this epidemic is of great importance for the lives of people all over the world.  If one can draw lessons from this latest development in the global political economy, then in two ways.  First, the importance of public health systems, and second, how important it is to use public finances for the benefit of many, not the few.  I will start with the health care system.
