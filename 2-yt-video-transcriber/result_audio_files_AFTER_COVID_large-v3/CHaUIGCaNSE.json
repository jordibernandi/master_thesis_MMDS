            "text": "Hey everyone and welcome.  Well, I've been looking through the old Twitter and I've found some interesting information about Ofcom, Diversity, Alicia Keys and ITV.  Oh, and Britain's Got No Talent.  Well, it turns out that their political stance, or should I say dance, on behalf of Black Lives Matter and Alicia Keys' absolutely disgusting attack on the fans of the same programme has cost them 450,000 viewers each week for two weeks.  So all I can say at this point is well done diversity, well done Alicia Keys, well done Britain's Got Talent and well done ITV.  You got woke, you went broke, the people have spoken, your ideology is not accepted, end of.  Personally it serves them right for hiring back a man that got drunk, went for a drive and nearly killed someone.  Yeah, I'm talking about you, Ant.  Absolutely disgusting that he gets away with that, but no one else would, would they?  But we'll keep quiet about that one.  Seems like the people have figured out what BLM is really about, and that's Marxist ideology.  You want to get rid of the nuclear family, do you, Black Lives Matter?  Well, you won't get any support from the British people, I tell you that much for nothing.  And the numbers on your latest protests prove me right.  I actually think this political stunt on Britain's Got Talent has done ITV, Diversity, Alicia Keys and BLM a huge disservice and I'll tell you why.  A lot of the normies, the people that don't pay attention to what's going on around them and just listen to the media, i.e.  the TV watchers, probably didn't know what was hidden behind the slogan Black Lives Matter, as we all do, and that is a trained Marxist movement.  We do now though, don't we, because they've been on Britain's Got Talent.  Yep, that's 450,000 viewers that they lost each week and you can guarantee nearly all of them, if not all, will have been families that just wanted to be entertained, not party politically danced at.  Which is what the main problem is.  On top of that, you also had Alicia Keys coming out and saying everyone that complained is a racist.  Well, looks like we've got one million racists have told you that they're not racists and you're a racist for even thinking it.  Am I wrong on that one?  Watch this space as well, everyone.  Watch Alicia Dixon's career disappear now.  How dare she call people racist with no proof whatsoever.  We will not be falsely accused by jumped-up B-stars.  To everyone that didn't watch, well done, everyone.  I appreciate that.  And so do the rest of the people.  Family entertainment should not be interspersed with scenes of violence and political messaging.  Doesn't matter what political messaging is, in my opinion.  There's a time and a place for that, and it isn't on a family show.  So you deserve everything you get, ITV, for doing that, and I hope it continues forever until you lose everybody.  Am I wrong, everyone?  Don't forget, like and subscribe, everyone.  Share it out.  See you on the next one. ",
