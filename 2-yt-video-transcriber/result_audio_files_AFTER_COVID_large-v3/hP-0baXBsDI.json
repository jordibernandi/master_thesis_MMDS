            "text": "at one point or another in our lives.  We all have prayed and asked God to do something for us, but it didn't happen as quickly as we wanted it to happen.  Over the years in my life, I have learned that God's delays are not God's denials.  The spiritual realm is vastly bigger than the natural world.  We don't know what is going on in the spiritual realm unless God reveals it to us.  We don't know what is going on behind the scenes on our behalf.  In the Old Testament, there is a captivating story about Daniel's prayer being heard in heaven.  Daniel is visited by an angel whose name is not disclosed.  This angel explains that he would have come sooner, but he was engaged in battle for 21 days by the prince of the kingdom of Persia.  and he required the assistance of Michael the Archangel to overcome this prince.  The angel spent three weeks earnestly attempting to visit Daniel, but he lacked the power to overcome the prince of Persia.  You see, the spirit realm is a realm of great conflict.  The prayer of Daniel went to heaven.  His prayer was heard, and his prayer was answered, and an angel was dispatched with the answer.  But the angel was unable to get through to Daniel because of this apparently high-ranking demon power that stopped him.  What can we learn from this?  is that demon powers have different ranks and powers, just like the angels that belong to the kingdom of God have different ranks and powers.  In Ephesians 6.12 we are told, For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.  The Bible refers to Michael the Archangel.  We know from the scriptures that he plays a unique role in God's plan and appears to be a high-ranking angel.  Then we have Gabriel, who also must have been a high-ranking angel.  He was sent with a specific message for Joseph and Mary concerning the arrival of the Messiah.  In fact, there are only three angels who are named in the Bible, Michael the Archangel, Gabriel, and Lucifer.  who of course is a fallen angel.  Now back to the story of Daniel.  What we need to realize is that Daniel's prayer had such powerful effects in the spiritual realm, so much so it helped one angel call for reinforcements.  We also need to realize it's no accident that the messenger said that his struggle with the prince of Persia lasted exactly the same amount of time that Daniel's fasting and prayer did, 21 days.  The reason for this is that the warfare in the spirit realm was being fought in a real sense by Daniel in the prayer realm.  Now imagine, if Daniel had given up on the tenth day, or had given up on the nineteenth day, Daniel would have blocked his angel from reaching him.  So I have a question for you today.  Are you blocking your angel?  Let me ask you again, are you blocking your angel?  Why do we give up on prayer?  Is it discouragement?  We ask for something and don't see results.  Or we don't like what happens and assume God isn't listening or at least not giving a favorable answer.  We all want our prayers to get answered right away.  When we don't see the answer immediately, we can be tempted to stop praying.  I've had people ask, how do I know when I should give up on a prayer?  My answer is always the same.  Never!  We can never quit turning to God.  Remember the things that are impossible with men are possible with God.  Our problem is that we now live in the age of the instant and some things just don't happen that way.  The Bible says that God is pleased with the passionate prayer of the righteous.  It's not about the length of your prayer.  It's the strength of your faith, your passion.  I want to encourage you to keep knocking and don't give up.  Prayer is the answer to your problem today.  Not a human, not the doctor, not your lawyer, not a psychologist.  Your prayer to the God of heaven is the answer.  Just because we don't see a change doesn't mean our words are not heard, but rather that there is a fight going on and it's up to you to engage and fight with your prayers.  Prayer opens up the gates of heaven.  Prayer brings God onto the scene.  Prayer lifts you higher to places you cannot go yourself.  The things that are impossible with men are possible with God.  Be the type of person who is passionate about prayer because that is the kind of person who will also be effective in prayer.  Be the type of person who does not give up on their prayer because that kind of person does not block their angel.  Be the type of person who does not give up on their prayer because that kind of person can touch heaven with their prayers.  Luke 11.9.  And so I tell you, keep on asking, and you will receive what you ask for.  Keep on seeking, and you will find.  Keep on knocking, and the door will be opened to you.  Then Jesus told his disciples a parable to show them that they should always pray and not give up.  Luke 18.1.  In the parable of the persistent widow, Jesus teaches us that prayer is not just a one-off ticking a box matter.  Although he encourages us that our Heavenly Father will hear our prayer, he also leaves no doubt that we may need to pray repeatedly and persistently until we receive our answer.  If you have been praying for something and are still waiting for God to answer, this is for you.  Do not lose heart.  Do not be discouraged.  Persist just as the widow persisted.  Persistent prayer.  is perhaps the weapon our enemy Satan fears the most.  This is why he will try and discourage us to not keep praying if we don't see a breakthrough right away.  The Bible is a book that teaches persistence, and you and I need to persist with our prayer life.  Persistence is worth the cost.  The payoff is exceedingly abundantly above all you could ever imagine.  But most believers don't do that.  That's why there are so many faith failures around. ",

He said if we'd continue, we would know the truth, and that the truth would make us free, John 8, 31 through 32.

And you have to stand up and fight back no matter what is happening to you, no matter how hard the fight is.  As long as you keep fighting, you will win.  The devil only wins if you let him.  Life will only win If you let it, fight on, fight on, fight on.  Don't tell me you can't fight anymore.  Don't tell me you can't fight anymore.  Don't tell me I'm tired and alone.  After all you have been through, you've got to take a stand.  You've got to take a stand.  Stand in the middle of heartache.  Stand in the middle of calamity.  Stand in the middle of the storm.  Stand in the middle of chaos.  Stand in the middle of failure.  Stand firm in the name of Jesus Christ.  Whatever it is, it will not defeat you.  If it is an illness, fight back against it.  It will not win.  It will not win.  The devil and his army cannot stop what God has ordained for you in 2020.  You will experience the blessings of the Lord this year.  The crown of favor is upon your head.  God will open doors for you.  But your duty, your responsibility is to be bold like a lion.  Look at the ones who have gone before you.  Moses, described in the Bible as the meekest man ever.  Yet Moses had the boldness to go face to face with the most powerful man on earth at that time.  And told him, let my people go.  Boldness.  The great soldier Joshua who took the sword and led the children of Israel to conquer kingdom after kingdom after kingdom after kingdom.  Boldness.  King David who slayed a lion, a bear and a giant as a small boy. ",
