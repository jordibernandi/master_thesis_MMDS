            "text": "Hey, yo, what up, YouTube?  Y'all know who it is.  I'm pretty sure, once again, y'all like your homeboy.  You're always on the go.  Yeah, I'm always on the go, plus I always got something to say.  So, I mean, since I'm always on the go and always got something to say, why not combine them two and give y'all this little hot video real quick?  But before I hit y'all with this video, I mean, I want to send all my prayers and condolences to the people out in California.  I got a lot of good friends and followers that follow me from Cali.  And they always hit me in the air box showing me these breast fires and these fires going on out in Cali.  And I want y'all to be careful, man.  Be careful and be safe, yo.  See what I'm saying?  I'm really not smoky to bed, so I don't know how to tell y'all how to prevent forest fires and how to stop it or what to do.  Because, see, one thing about the East Coast, we don't really have to deal with that really over here.  You know what I'm saying?  I'm saying like forest fires and all that, what y'all go through, we don't go through.  So the only thing I can do is send y'all my condolence, man, and my prayers and prayers.  Y'all stay prayed up and y'all going to be all right, man.  One thing about it, everything you lose, you can gain back by the light.  If you understand what I'm saying, man, the material stuff, we can all gain back.  But just try not to lose a life trying to gain what you already got, trying to save your worldly possessions.  I mean, and that's not trying to be funny.  I'm being genuine as I can.  I want all my people to be safe out there.  It's just not the melanated ones.  Because when it comes to saving human life, if you're human, man, that goes for all races too.  You feel what I'm saying?  So it's just not for my melanated people.  Everybody out in California, man, y'all be careful, man.  Now back to the regular schedule programming.  I did this video.  Oh, before I even start that, before I even start that, I want to also shout out to the people that donate to my channel.  I mean, I love y'all.  I always end these videos off.  I have started recently by telling y'all I love y'all, which is I don't be trying to be funny.  It be genuine.  The love come from me be genuine.  So when I end my videos by telling my subscribers and everybody that mess with me, I love them.  That's genuine.  I really do.  Thanks for the support.  Thanks for everything y'all do for me.  And I'm glad I'm on your side.  I'm glad we on this team together, man.  We're going to fight this war together.  Now back to the regular schedule program.  I did this video on this note alone.  You got to understand something black people.  You know I did a video, I think I dropped the video day before yesterday and I told y'all I had this conversation with this older guy.  And you know he wasn't down with NFAC and all that.  So I did a video.  I wasn't knocking the older generation.  That is why I'm partly doing this video.  I'm doing this video to let y'all know it is our elders.  That's standing up on the front line more than these young soldiers, man.  And I want to send my love out to y'all.  I get more positive email coming from the elders that want to stand on the front line with NFAC and do the right thing.  It's because they feel this is the right time.  But now we go talk to these Jets out here, these young bucks.  Yo, they still stuck up on trying to find out what Tekashi69 doing.  They asking me, like, yo, Drop, the only thing you want to talk about is NFAC now.  And then I tell them, like, yo, Scooby, right now, NFAC is what we need.  Tekashi69 and who Will Smith and Jada Smith sleeping with, that ain't helping our movement, man.  That ain't helping our movement.  Me pushing these videos and trying to get people in order is more what we need.  I mean, if you ain't got to be, if you, hey, man, I'm not trying to push, in fact, down nobody's throat.  I ain't trying to push NFAC down nobody's throat.  But you got to stand something besides this nonsense, man.  See, young boys, y'all letting these older people outdo y'all, man.  I mean, and it's crazy.  The older women, my older queens is hitting me up on a regular basis.  I'm proud of what you're doing.  I wish it was more people like you and Grandmaster J. I mean, only thing I do is I do what I do for my community and hit y'all with these videos.  Grandmaster J, I could don't, I mean, I give all props to that dude.  I mean, it's just crazy how the young people don't want to stand behind this movement.  I mean, it's like the young people want to do everything but stand up for what's real.  And what we are going through right now, people, is real.  This ain't going nowhere until we make it go somewhere.  And that's all I'm saying.  I'm proud of my elders, man.  Keep showing me the love, keep sending me the emails.  I'm proud of y'all.  I mean, and I would never think I wouldn't.  And then I think people kind of got a twisted when I did a little video about the other dude.  But man, hey, everybody, of course, everybody not going to be down with.  In fact, I mean, I just felt some kind of way is because he was trying to get me to stop doing what I'm doing.  I look at it like this.  I don't have to be down with your movement.  But I'm not going to stop you from promoting your movement if that's what you feel is right for you.  I mean, so I didn't crucify a dude.  I mean, I respected him because everybody's entitled to their own opinion.  Yes, that's why I didn't respect.  People said I shouldn't have kept calling him old man.  I didn't know the older guy fellow.  I didn't even know his name.  If I had known his name, I would have used his name.  That was the only reason I kept saying the old guy.  It was no disrespect because some of these real soldiers Are coming from the elder generation.  The older generation.  My elders.  So yeah man.  I did this video to big them up.  Give them some love.  Because I swear to God.  It seem like the young ones just don't get it.  I don't know if it's the drugs that's taking over y'all minds or whatever the case may be, but Scooby, it gotta be a better way than what we doing.  I mean, y'all wanna fight and argue and beef about everything but the real thing.  That's what's real.  In fact, it's what's real.  Police brutality is what's real.  Tekashi69 is not real.  I mean, yeah, granted, he a real person, but what is he doing to try to better us as black people, man?  I mean, granted, I do got a channel where I upload all the ignorance you want to see.  But it's not going to be on this channel.  I'm not using this channel for the ignorance, man.  I mean, it's the older people that's keeping me here.  They keeping me focused because it's not coming from the younger generation on this channel.  You understand what I'm saying?  So I fight for my older people.  Yes, I do.  I'm going to continue to fight.  My elders, I'm standing by y'all.  I don't care what they sit and say about.  I should upload different material on this channel.  This is my channel.  I'm going to continue to upload what I want to upload.  You understand what I'm saying?  It's just sad.  It's sad.  But then y'all be the main ones.  And this is to the young guys.  That when things don't go your way with the police, all of a sudden, then y'all want to scream, well, why ain't nobody doing nothing?  But when you got somebody out here, when you got people out here trying to do something, y'all ain't rocking with them.  You ain't down with them.  Y'all doing everything to tear people down besides rocking with them.  You want to call in the op here, agent?  Come on, man.  I mean, come on, man.  Your best friend tell on you every day.  He the agent.  He the op.  Grandmaster J ain't asking for none of y'all money.  None of y'all money.  So y'all can kill it with the agent.  He's an agent of who he working for.  How about he working for black people?  You ain't never thought about that.  That man ain't ask for a dime.  I ain't never seen him get on here and ask for a dime.  Until he start asking for money, man, y'all stop calling that dude an agent like he out here for something other than helping black people.  And to my elders, man, I love y'all, man.  That's out of respect because y'all have been holding it down.  Y'all have been holding it down better than these young boys have.  So I continue to see y'all in my inbox, man, and I love y'all.  Once again, and this is to my elders, and this is drop down, man.  That was my rebuttal, and I'm out. ",
