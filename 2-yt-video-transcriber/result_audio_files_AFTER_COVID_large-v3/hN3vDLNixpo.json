            "text": "Gentlemen, welcome back to MGTOW Money.  Today's topic, your dad didn't tell you this.  Before I get to that, thanks to the Patreon supporters on this channel.  Thank you guys for your continuing support.  And Thomas, call out to you.  I hope I answered your question.  I know that it was a lengthy response to your question.  But you know what?  It was an extremely thought-provoking, terrific question that you asked me.  Brother, let me just tell you in 10 words or less.  Look, this is a marathon.  It's not a sprint.  So I hope those actionable ideas helped you.  And I didn't want to give you just some glib two-sentence response.  So anyway, I really sincerely hope that helped you.  All right.  On to today's topic, your dad didn't tell you this.  Gentlemen, I don't know about you, I grew up in a, relatively speaking, let's just say a fatherless environment.  My... father was around, let's just say sometimes, mentally, physically.  I'm not going to get into the details, but I know that a lot of men, especially today in today's world, grow up in a similar environment where maybe they don't even know who their father is or they might have known him years ago.  and they have no contact with them, etc.  And I've done videos about the curse, and it is literally a curse of single motherhood, of women attempting, and I stress that word, attempting to raise boys, I think is an absolute atrocity.  and is causing tremendous issues throughout Western society.  So needless to say, I'm extremely concerned about men growing up without fathers or without a real father figure.  And let me just say clearly, I sincerely feel for you.  As a man in his 50s, I understand how extremely difficult it probably is.  And even as you get older, you don't necessarily get over it, to be frank with you.  So I want to give you some of what I wish my father would have told me.  Now.  Before I get into that, let me specifically call out a word to our sponsor.  Our sponsor today, gentlemen, is guess who?  It's Webull.  Webull offers free, commission-free stock trading, crypto trading, and most importantly, if you haven't already, go right now and grab your two free shares of stock from Webull.  I said free.  You go open an account with Webull and they will give you two free shares of stock.  Furthermore, if you put in $100 into your account after opening, you'll end up with two additional shares of stock.  So you'll end up with four shares of stock after you put your $100 in.  You can take it out And you can keep your four shares of stock.  You can get stock like in Starbucks, Facebook.  I've mentioned before I got NVIDIA.  NVIDIA, by the way, has approximately tripled since they gave it to me about a year and a half ago.  Yeah, you heard me.  It's gone up about 300% since they gave me a share of NVIDIA.  The point is, men, go right now.  Go to the video description right now.  Click on the link.  At the very least, open up your free account, emphasize the word.  Free account with Webull.  Grab your two shares of stock.  Back on topic.  What I wish my dad would have given me was just some negative advice.  In other words, what I'm talking about, men, is some things that, hey, look, son, you need to avoid some things.  Not go do some things.  You need to avoid some things.  So let me go over some things that I wish he would have told me to avoid.  One.  Avoid complications.  What do you mean complications, Dad?  What I'm talking about are complications like women.  Yeah, I'm not going to go into that.  Thousands of hours have been discussed about women.  Lots of much brighter MGTOW than me have discussed women.  Go listen to their stuff.  Two, avoid debt.  Again, I've done lots of stuff on this.  I know lots of men have differing opinions, but let me tell you, there is nothing like living a debt-free lifestyle, especially over the past 12 months after we've been through.  Three, stay away from expensive cars, sports cars, that type of thing.  They are a very serious complication that will, yeah, in the short run they feel good, they are great, but in the long run they are a financial problem.  it's kind of like having a boat.  you know it's just an endless amount of money that you're going to keep pouring into it.  let me mention a couple of other quick complications.  next avoid pets.  i've mentioned this one before.  i know some guys get all hung about this.  let me speak from my own experience.  i love dogs.  i've been around dogs my entire life.  i have owned multiple dogs.  i'm speaking from experience.  pets can be a major drag.  they can be a major complication on your life men.  I can promise you I can assure you in the long run you'll be better without them.  and let me finish up with the last thing.  another complication forget buying a house before about age 40. in my opinion again It's going to be another significant complication that especially for young men, you don't want to bring into your house.  You buy a house, you're deciding not only on a particular city, you're deciding on a particular neighborhood, you're deciding on a particular street, you're deciding on a particular lot.  Look, you don't need that type of hassle in your life.  You don't need that type of complication in your life.  Next, don't settle for any old job.  Don't just say, I'll just take a job being a waiter or working in a warehouse or whatever.  I get it.  I one time actually had a family member, a woman, of course, who was telling me, when I was unemployed, by the way, oh, you should just get a job as a waiter.  No, no.  Let me be clear.  I got nothing.  I have nothing against waiters or being in a service staff position, but that's not where I wanted to be in the short run or long run.  My point is you need to be picky.  You need to be particular.  You need to be looking at jobs, at employment differently.  that has upside.  Upside with money.  Upside with benefits.  Upside with advancement.  Maybe it has stock options.  The point is that you don't want to get locked into a role.  Okay, I'm making $12 an hour.  I'm making $20 an hour.  But that's all that I can make.  Period.  End of story.  And I've got no real career advancement.  And they're not going to help me with my education.  And there's no type of pension, 401k, whatever.  The point is, is that you want to be looking at a job as being a springboard to get you into something stronger in your life.  I'm not saying necessarily to change jobs, although you might want to do so within the same organization as I did numerous times.  But the point is that you want to have this be sort of a starting point.  Okay, this is going to be step one getting into this company.  And then there's going to be all these other steps that are going to get me even more forward to my life goal, which presumably is FU money, as I've discussed numerous times here.  Three, the next thing that I wish my dad would have told me, again, told me to avoid, avoid distractions.  Yeah, women are a huge distraction.  I've already discussed complications, but let me give you a couple of other distractions.  One of my worst distractions for a good portion of my life, fortunately I broke the habit many decades ago, was watching TV.  I think television used to be what video games are today, especially for a lot of young people.  Frankly, they are toxic.  There's nothing wrong with playing video games.  There's nothing wrong with watching TV.  But you've got to do it in, frankly, small doses.  And whatever a small dose for you is, it can't be beyond a couple of hours a day.  If you're getting beyond a couple of hours a day doing different stuff like that, that's toxic.  That is not moving you forward in your life.  And believe you me, again, I'm speaking from experience as a person who wasted, absolutely wasted hours on such stupid stuff like that.  Furthermore, talk about distractions, getting involved in politics and arguing on social media, etc.  Fortunately, I never got into that, but I have heard a lot of people do.  Again, believe me, that is a total waste of time.  One thousand percent.  You are wasting your life doing that.  You need to get focused daily.  Focus obsessively.  Focus on your goals daily.  frankly, for FU money.  Remember, you're going to be, I've discussed this in prior videos, writing down your goals, thinking about your goals.  You're going to become a fanatic about your goals.  Let me give you some specific things that I used to do when I was in the corporate world, when I was working towards my FU money.  For example, I had sitting on my desk for years, and I emphasize years, I had a photograph of a place, a beautiful scenery shot of a place that I knew in the future, and this was decades into the future when it ultimately happened, where I wanted to own additional property, where I wanted to spend part of the year, if not the entire year.  So I had a photo, and I was always looking at it every single day.  Yeah, it works.  I know it sounds goofy.  But guess what?  It works.  Also, you know what else I was doing basically on a daily basis?  I was looking at my net worth.  Now, it would fluctuate daily, of course, unfortunately.  But the point is, I knew in the long term, over the weekly, monthly, yearly basis, it would increase.  I was also on a regular basis, a consistent basis, again, and I've talked about this in the past, looked at doing lots and lots of small hustles, lots of little things.  I mentioned this before.  Look, if somebody put a dollar in my hand, you know what I did?  I closed my hand and I said, thank you.  That was it.  I was moving forward.  I realized a dollar, what difference does that make?  You know what though?  That got me a little bit closer to where I wanted to go.  It was a dollar more than I had the day before.  And the point is, is that you're going to be moving.  You might be moving at a glacial pace, at a very slow pace, but you can do this, but you got to get started.  Another thing that I used to do, again, I used to have an old, anybody remember the Nokia phones?  Yeah, I had a Nokia phone.  I had a Nokia phone where you could like adjust the customized like a little message or something.  You know what I had on that?  I customized that message with a date that was I think was probably 15 years into the future.  This is obviously years ago.  15 years into the future and a specific dollar amount that I was shooting for as being my FU money goal.  That's how long I was at this.  And I did it.  Like a fanatic.  Like I was in a cult.  But the cult was about me and moving forward to my FDU money to achieve my goals.  And you can do the same thing.  Let me finish by saying, again, I get it.  It's tough growing up.  without a father.  A lot of us are there.  A lot of us have been there.  And you are going to build yourself up without one.  And you can do so.  If you put some of these actionable ideas into place right now, you will be so far ahead of your peers that their envy that they're snickering, that they're talking behind your back about, man, you're acting weird.  You know what?  That's going to be fuel to your fire because you're going to get the FU money and they're going to be working until they're 70.  Gentlemen, as always, I hope you found this profitable.  Only if you did, hit the like button.  Otherwise, John Galt. ",
