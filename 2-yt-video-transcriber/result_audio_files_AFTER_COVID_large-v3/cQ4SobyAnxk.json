            "text": "Just talking like Hitler and using the same rhetorical and xenophobic manipulative themes to gain power and foment fear doesn't necessarily mean anything.  And we want to be fair and balanced, T-M-C-R, at Cody Schody, right out of the gate, all right?  It's fair.  to say that Donald Trump is not a totalitarian, which Hitler was.  Totalitarianism is when a regime has full control over every aspect of life, and fascism generally is authoritarian, a lesser version of totalitarianism, in which a dictator or committee or an otherwise small group of political elites maintain full political power, but they're not totalitarian.  Authoritarians are only concerned with political power, and as long as that is not contested, it gives society a certain degree of liberty.  Historians of fascism also recognize Trump's authoritarianism, but again, we'll get into that.  Trump is not Hitler.  He is racist.  But he's not so severely and specifically racist that he has a plan to put people in camps and exterminate them.  It doesn't seem.  Nazism, from the get-go, was explicitly racist and had a specific program and ideology.  But fascism, on the whole, is actually more fluid than that.  Mussolini and fascist movements in general are often described as being ideologically inconsistent, marked by unprincipled opportunism, making alliances and compromises for the goal of gaining more power and progressing the movement.  So it's unfair to say that Trump has a bunch of Hitler plans, but it's balanced to say that doesn't mean he's not a fascist.  Fascism is fluid and takes on qualities of its nation and leader.  Mussolini liked to claim that he was the definition of fascism.  Some historians believe that it's more apt to just call German fascism Hitlerism, Italian fascism Mussoliniism, and like, maybe like American fascism would be like Trumpism.  But when people today say, you're a Nazi, or Trump is Hitler, it's exaggerated shorthand for American fascism, which is a shorthand for... Well, we'll get to that.  And sure, there are actual neo-Nazis out there, which we'll get into, and actual white nationalists out there, which we'll get into.  But American fascism won't look like that.  We wouldn't use symbols like the swastika or the Italian fascis, seen here behind Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen, as she lies about separating children from their parents and putting them in camps.  As historian of fascism Robert Paxson explains in his book, The Anatomy of Fascism, no swastikas in an American fascism, but stars and stripes, or stars and bars, and Christian crosses, no fascist salute, but mass recitations of the Pledge of Allegiance, like maybe how detained migrant children are reciting the Pledge of Allegiance every morning in their camps.  Paxton goes on to say, American fascism wouldn't have a bunch of people wearing the same uniform for their dear leader.  American fascism symbology would have to be as familiar and reassuring to loyal Americans as the language and symbols of the original fascisms were familiar and reassuring to many Italians and Germans.  Like, maybe instead of everyone wearing the same uniform, they'd wear something that represents, like, a national pastime that everybody already wears to promote their collective passions and inclusion in a group without sacrificing their individualism.  And fascism isn't about antisemitism specifically. ",
