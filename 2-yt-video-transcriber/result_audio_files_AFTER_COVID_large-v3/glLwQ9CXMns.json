            "text": "One of the most remarkable facts about London is that its primary financial district is actually a city in itself.  Known as the City of London, it was established a few years after the Roman invasion in 50 AD on the north bank of the River Thames.  William the Conqueror gave sovereign status to the City of Londoners in 1694, allowing them to continue enjoying separate rights and privileges as long as they recognised him as king.  The kings that succeeded William built a new capital and called it Westminster.  Westminster then joined up with surrounding towns and villages and became the bustling metropolis that we know as London today.  Since then, however, the City of London, one square mile in the heart of London, has remained semi-independent.  While it's not an independent nation like the Vatican, laws passed by the British Parliament do not in fact apply to the City of London.  The city in fact elects its own mayor, who negotiates both with the British state and overseas heads of state, and is supported by a committee of so-called aldermen, nearly all of whom are representatives of financial firms located in the city.  The Lord Mayor, the Committee of Aldermen and the entire political structure of the city are unashamedly the representatives of corporate financial interests.  The City of London is effectively a state run by international financial elites in their own interest, and has become the centre of an international web of power spun by these elites.  How did this happen?  Well, in the 18th century London succeeded Amsterdam as the centre of international finance, and in the 19th century the British Empire became the dominant force in the world, to the point that by the middle of the century half of all of the world's manufacturing was based in Britain.  This led to the rise of the City of London as the centre of international finance and trade.  A huge number of foreign-born merchants moved their business to London by the middle of the 18th century.  These merchants established guilds and wielded great influence and power.  They were able to secure autonomy and special freedoms and rights for the residents that businesses in the area enjoy to this day.  This group of alien residents included the Dutch Jews who came over as London succeeded Amsterdam as a centre for international exchanges, and played a major role in London banking and insurance, and as investors in government stocks.  A number of other merchant families migrated to London in this period.  The cities from which they were drawn, principally Frankfurt, Hamburg and Constantinople, were international trading ports.  Their prosperity was derived from their location at the focus of a mosaic of small states and at the meeting point of different ethnic and religious traditions.  so that over the centuries each evolved an elite of mercantile families drawn from various races and creeds.  Their situation then was broadly favourable to the development of an aristocracy of international financiers, with no loyalty to any nation or project beyond their own enrichment and power.  As the British Empire became an empire on which the sun never set, in the City of London there emerged all sorts of middle and small sized commercial institutions that were really specialists on different countries.  And this became the bedrock of the city's success, highly specialised knowledge of various areas in the world.  After the Second World War, the British Empire began to withdraw from its former colonies, to the point that by the 1980s the largest empire the world had ever seen shrank down to contain just remnants and debris, including the United Kingdom, three adjacent Crown Territories, Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man, and dependent overseas territories which included some small Caribbean islands, the Falkland Islands and Gibraltar.  But the remarkable fact about the British Empire is that while it disappeared completely from most contemporary maps of the world, it never went away on one map, the map of contemporary international finance.  On the face of it, New York is the largest international financial centre, followed by London.  But this data treats British jurisdictions like Jersey, Guernsey, the Cayman Islands and so on as entirely separate, independent territories.  they are in fact part of the British state.  If added together, you find that roughly one-third of all international deposits and investments are going through these jurisdictions, which are remnants of the British Empire and which remain part of the British state.  And if you add ex-colonies whose independence was relatively recent, like Singapore, then you reach a figure of 40%, that compared to roughly 10% going through the US.  To understand how this new British empire, the colossal financial empire, formed, we have to go back to 1956, the Suez Canal crisis.  This was a time when Britain's global dominance was in steep decline.  Egypt nationalised the Suez Canal Company and took control of the canal, displacing the international consortium that had run it for nearly a century.  France, Israel and the United Kingdom almost immediately began planning a joint military action to retake control, while seeking to win international support for a diplomatic solution.  Israel invaded the Sinai and France and the United Kingdom used Egypt's counterattack as an excuse to attack it by air.  One week later, however, Britain undercut the operation by accepting a United Nations resolution for a ceasefire, primarily due to intense pressure from the US.  This has come to be seen as Britain's last throw of the imperial dice, and led to a political crisis that eventually led to the resignation of its Prime Minister, Anthony Eden.  More significantly though, the Suez was also a financial crisis.  Throughout 1956 and 57, the United Kingdom had a current account surplus despite the disruptions to its international trade, but the value of its currency came under speculative pressure.  The currency crisis was partly engineered by the US, which was unhappy about the British role in the invasion.  In response to the run on the pound, the Treasury raised interest rates and imposed a moratorium on lending to non-British borrowers.  These policies were intended to strengthen the pound, but it cut many commercial banks, which specialised in lending to ex-colonies or the informal empire of Latin America, off from their business.  Many city banks, which had evolved over more than a century as specialists in international lending to British imperial outposts, saw their core business disappear overnight.  At this point, representatives of the city banks approached the Governor of the Bank of England.  Without consulting the British Treasury, the Bank of England decided that they could continue lending as long as they used dollars or other non-sterling currency, and intermediated between non-British clients.  The agreement meant that such transactions were deemed by the bank not to be taking place in London.  This liberated them from the regulatory regime not only of the UK, but of any country.  As these transactions were taking place in London, they could not be regulated by any other regulatory authority, and ended up therefore in a regulatory vacuum.  This led to the growth of what is called the Euromarket, or as we know it, the offshore financial market.  This is the origin of the now well-known practice of offshoring.  Today, almost the entire wholesale global financial market is effectively an expansion of the Euro-market, offshore and mostly subject to voluntary regulation.  American banks, increasingly constrained by a series of New Deal financial legislation, discovered the opportunities that London offered them to escape their own financial regulations and began to set up branches in London specialising in Euro-market operations.  However, despite London's lax financial regulation, it still had relatively high tax rates.  So London financiers began to develop British islands as offshore financial enclaves for tax purposes.  The financial elite followed a clear geographical path, beginning from those islands nearest to the UK, such as the Channel Islands, soon followed by the British-held Caribbean jurisdictions, then Asia and lastly British-held Pacific Islands.  Within a decade, a complex web of offshoring had developed that was effectively an extension of the City of London.  The result today is a London-centred, integrated global financial centre that covers all of the major time zones, tries on lack of regulation and taxation, is a specialist in incorporeal and increasingly risk assets, and uses English common law which encourages so-called financial innovation.  So the British Empire, in fact, never really went away.  While independence has been granted to former British colonies, the London financial elite, who always profited most from empire, responded to the decline of empire by using backroom deals and their political influence to create a new, financial empire which spans the globe and grants them more power than ever.  Due to offshoring, some calculate that as much as half of the world's wealth is now hidden in these so-called treasure islands, totally untaxed.  While the means of their influence has changed, the same class of super-rich, unaccountable financial elite of the City of London continues to dominate the globe financially. ",
