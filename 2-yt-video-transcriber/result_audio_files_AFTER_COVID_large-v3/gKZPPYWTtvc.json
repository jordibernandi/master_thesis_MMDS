            "text": "Right, but he did not need to rise from nothing to get that job.  In fact, he reminds me of a lot of other leaders, of Frederick the Great, for example.  in prussia.  these are people who inherited the greatest army of their day.  alexander unless he was an imbecile was going to be great no matter what because i mean if you inherit the wehrmacht you're going to be able to do something with it right?  uh alexander's father may have been greater philip.  uh he philip ii was the guy who who literally did create uh a a strong kingdom from a disjointed group of people that were continually beset by their neighbors.  He's the one that reformed that army, took things that he had learned from other Greek leaders like the Theban leader at Pamanondas, and then laboriously over his lifetime stabilized the frontiers built this system.  he lost an eye doing it.  he he he his leg was made lame.  i mean he.  this was a man who looked like.  he built the empire and led from from the front ranks.  i mean um so and then and then who may have been killed by his son?  we don't know who assassinated philip um but then handed the greatest army the world had ever seen to his son who then did great things with it.  uh you see this this pattern many times.  so in my mind I'm not sure Alexander really can be that great when you compare him to people who arose from nothing.  So the difference between what we would call in the United States, the self-made man or the one who inherits a fortune.  There's an old line that, you know, it's a slur, but it's about rich people.  And it's like, he was born on third base and thought he hit a triple, right?  Philip was born... at home plate and he had to hit, Alexander started on third base.  And so I try to draw a distinction between them.  Genghis Khan is tough because there's two traditions.  The tradition that we grew up with here in the United States and that I grew up learning was that he was a self-made man.  But there is a tradition, and it may be one of those things that's put after the fact, because a long time ago, whether or not you had blue blood in your veins was an important distinction.  And so the distinction that you'll often hear from Mongolian history is that this was a nobleman who had been deprived of his inheritance, so he was a blue blood anyway.  I don't know which is true.  There's certainly, I mean, when you look at a Genghis Khan, though, you have to go, That is a wicked amount of things to have achieved.  He's very impressive as a figure.  Attila is very impressive as a figure.  Hitler's an interesting figure.  He's one of those people \u2013 you know, the more you study about Hitler, the more you wonder where the defining moment was.  Because if you look at his life, I mean, Hitler was a relatively \u2013 common soldier in the first world war.  i mean he was brave.  he got uh he got some decorations.  in fact the highest decoration he got in the first world war was given to him by a jewish officer and it was uh he often didn't talk about that decoration even though it was the more prestigious one because it would open up a whole can of worms you didn't want to get into but hitler's.  i mean if you said who was hitler today one of the top things you're going to say is he was an anti-semite.  Well, then you have to draw a distinction between general, regular anti-Semitism that was pretty common in the era and something that was a rabid level of anti-Semitism.  But Hitler didn't seem to show a rabid level of anti-Semitism until after or at the very end of the First World War.  So if this is a defining part of this person's character and much of what we consider to be his evil stems from that \u2013 What happened to this guy when he's an adult, right?  He's already fought in the war to change him so.  I mean, it's almost like the old, there was always a movie theme.  Somebody gets hit by something on the head and their whole personality changes, right?  I mean, it almost seems something like that.  So I don't think I call that necessarily a great leader.  To me, the interesting thing about Hitler is what the hell happened to a nondescript person who didn't really impress anybody with his skills.  and And then in the 1920s, it's all of a sudden, as you said, sort of the man of the hour, right?  So that to me is kind of fast.  I have this feeling that Genghis Khan, and we don't really know, was an impressive human being from the get-go.  And then he was raised in this environment with pressure on all sides.  You start with this diamond and then you polish it and you harden it his whole life.  Hitler seems to be a very unimpressive gemstone most of his life.  And then all of a sudden, so I mean- I don't think I can label great leaders.  And I'm always fascinated by that idea that \u2013 and I'm trying to remember who the quote was by \u2013 that great men \u2013 oh, Lord Acton.  So great men are often not good men.  And that in order to be great, you would have to jettison many of the moral qualities that we normally would consider \u2013 a jesus or a gandhi or you know martin.  these these qualities that one looks at as as the good upstanding moral qualities that we should all aspire to as examples.  right the buddha whatever it might be.  um those people wouldn't make good leaders because what you need to be a good leader often requires the kind of choices that a true philosophical diogenes moral man wouldn't make.  yeah um so i don't have an answer to your question.  how about that?  that's a very long way of saying i don't know.
