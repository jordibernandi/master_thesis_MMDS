            "text": "My name is Richard and this is If You Only Knew.  Today's episode is titled Think Optics, Think Awakening the People, Justice is Coming.  But as usual, first let's get into the headlines.  Maxwell's date in court will be postponed until Monday.  The Manhattan federal judge on Wednesday evening agreed to postpone the unsealing depositions related to the sex life of Elaine Maxwell until... The alleged madam can file an appeal.  The order by Judge Loretta Preska will, for two business days, block the release of documents that relate to a deposition of accuser Virginia Gufri.  Preska ordered the documents unsealed in a court hearing last week, but gave Maxwell's team a week to file an appeal with the Second Circuit Court.  If the court does not order them to remain sealed, the documents will be made public on Monday, according to Preska's order.  Over 100 police agencies pull out of agreements to guard the DNC conventions on top of the restriction that the Dems have placed on the police.  This comes another week after the police formally endorsed President Trump.  So even if it were not intended as a message to Biden, it would certainly seem like a message.  Also regarding Biden, we know that a running mate is going to be announced in the coming week or early August.  However, as we all know, Biden will not be the final candidate.  But before we get to that Biden will select a running mate.  Politico prematurely announced that Kamala Harris was selected, but we know that Kamala's numbers were poor at best.  She barely had 1% before dropping out, and I'm sure the Dems know that they need someone with more pull to go up against Donald Trump.  My impression is that this was a side for clicks and part of an effort to create and build up interest or excitement leading up to the decision, but that's not going to be Kamala.  By the way, it's hard not to notice what looks like plastic surgery on Kamala Harris, like she's getting ready for something.  I do think Biden would appoint Kamala as a cabinet position, but not as VP.  Here's an article you won't read in the mainstream media of a company standing up to the woke mob.  Trader Joe's in Red State is standing up their ground.  and not changing their product names to reflect the relentless cancel culture's ethos.  With all the corporations bowing down to the mob, it's actually impressive to see one company standing up.  Here's another interesting article from Philadelphia's Inquirer suggesting that the rate of registration for Republicans right now is five times higher than Democrats.  Mind you, the Democrats actually outnumber registered Republicans within the state.  Is this a silent majority?  I do believe so.  Check out this article from News Bunch.  John Kerry warns of revolution in November if Trump wins while he lays the foundation for it.  Given some of the warnings we've heard of a potential cyber attack, it's hard to ignore this.  Is it a message to somebody or foreshadowing?  Remember optics.  Chicago had another weekend of violence, and it was also discovered that the majority of stolen guns are coming from Illinois.  This follows just a week after Chicago Mayor Lightfoot reluctantly allowed federal officers to the city in order to investigate claims that the local authorities had everything under control.  The silver lining here, however, is that Americans are taking notes.  Actually, this week, Americans took a lot of notes.  In Minneapolis, residents have been patrolling their own neighborhoods as the city moves to defund the police.  By the way, who do you think these people are going to vote for come November?  Now, needless to say, people who have been affected in cities across the United States, they've already seen how the government has responded.  While the media claims the majority of protests are peaceful, with 183 statues defaced, as I reported last week, here is the of the Federalist Party.  And businesses and lives destroyed naturally result of the movement to defund the police crime, as the word.  This week, we all heard about the reporter who did a complete 180 from claiming the protests were peaceful into going into shock after seeing the Starbucks downstairs from his apartment destroyed and tweeted considering buying a firearms to protect himself.  Well, whatever the original plan was, it certainly has backfired.  We know that they expected Trump to send in lots of troops to overwhelm the protesters, and, well, he didn't.  And yet another plan to ensnare the president has failed.  As patriots knew the playbook, after the nine minutes of footage that ran during Barr's hearing showing how the media falsely portrayed the riots as peaceful, This damaged the dam's narrative, and many more new people are now connecting the dots.  People who only saw the media's false narrative showing the riots as mostly peaceful, well, that fell apart now also. ",

In fact, for the first time, many Americans were made aware that the riots in Portland had been going on for over 60 days, never mind a long list of riots that are going on across the country that they didn't even know about.  We saw the footage of Nadler calling Antifa a myth, which Jim Jordan called out, despite the mockery of a hearing where Barr wasn't allowed to answer.  Barr still did an incredible job countering the claims with statements such as, since when is it okay to burn down a federal courthouse?  Now, for the average person, that makes a lot of sense and is probably painful to watch, seeing how all the Dems would not allow Barr the opportunity to speak.  But this only further exposes them to the public.  Even if you were against Barr, at some point you would still be annoyed that he wasn't allowed to answer.  Barr was patient for five hours as the charade continued until McGregor Powell finally got to what this was really all about.  This was really all about asking Barr if Durham investigation would be released before the election.  This was all about panic the entire time.  However, Barr remained calm and also revealed that there's another member of the team, John Bash, who is investigating the unmasking of Michael Flynn.  So not only are the Dems already panicking about Durham, they're learning about another investigation happening as well.  On top of this, the DOJ agreed to release FBI texts from Andrew McCabe, which we all know are going to be revealing, and potentially expose he as well as Comey.  Also, according to tweets from Adam Huesley in the community's digital news, Peter Strzok has been working with the investigators.  Just imagine the level of panic that the Dems, the Deep State, and the mainstream media are experiencing knowing that all these investigations were coming before the election.  but it really is going to get worse.  The Frontline Doctors video that Breitbart posted was seen by, what, 16 million people before.  it was censored by big tech, namely Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Squarespace, which refused now to host the website of the Frontline Doctors.  Naturally, of course, digital patriots shared the video for the next couple of days as it was deleted, then re-uploaded, then deleted, then re-uploaded to more and millions more all over social media networks.  But media outlets also noticed the censorship as well.  More notably, the president discussed this incident.  Now, imagine the number of Americans who are now aware of this as a result of this level of exposure.  But more importantly, Americans also saw how the censorship took place in plain view.  They saw big tech censure a cure which could have saved potentially tens of thousands.  For anyone who hasn't seen the relentless censorship from the media, this would be a massive rude awakening.  Remember that just a few weeks back, the media presented a very different perspective and Yale became one of the respected voices championing HCQ.  which was echoed by later on CNN.  However, all of a sudden there's a complete reversal.  Look at this meme from Jordan Sather.  Them, listen to doctors.  Us, okay.  Them, not her.  Them, elevate black voices.  Us, okay.  Them, not her.  Them, we need a cure.  Us, here's one.  Them, not that one.  While Barr hearing exposed the Dems, this was the topic of the week in the public's eyes.  No matter how hard this was censored, people were talking about this.  They're taking note.  In this episode, I also want to discuss the massive nothing burger of the big tech hearing on Capitol Hill on July 29th.  Jack Dorsey was a no show and everything seems scripted.  Google denied blacklisting or shadow banning, which we know they do.  And there's even an alleged God mode.  Mark Zuckerberg defended censoring Don  Jr.,  and Jim Jordan listed 15 examples of censorship being done by big tech, some of which I think were better than others.  Representative Greg Stube grilled the CEO of Google on why they were hiding Gateway Pundit and demanded evidence within two weeks.  One noteworthy moment was Zuckerberg calling out China on theft of intellectual property, but this could also be a diversionary tactic as well.  Overall, however, there wasn't any major breakthroughs, and I have to agree with Tucker's assessment that this was a failed opportunity to put big tech on the spot.  Fortunately, President Trump is taking greater measures.  Earlier this week, President Trump implemented an order to discourage further censorship by preventing the altering of free speech of users and limited protection from lawsuits under Section 230.  After the disappointing hearings, the president tweeted that additional measures can be made through executive orders.  Speaking of controversial executive orders from the president.  Will the president delay elections?  I don't believe so, but I expect to hear plenty of uproar on this, and I'm sure you'll see within the media on full blast about power grabs and anything they can use to establish a totalitarian narrative.  Now, I want to get to today's topic and explain the title.  Think optics.  Think awakening the people.  Justice is coming.  Remember that everything you're watching is a movie and that this is very slowly unfolding.  The movie is being directed by the patriots who are in control.  and who started investigations a long time ago so they would be concluded before the election, just so that the people could see the truth for themselves.  This was a plan to make sure that some discoveries come to light at the right time and create the largest impact.  This was about waking up the people through timed events.  Did you notice how Trump endorsed mask wearing first before the video?  We know that this tactic removes the need for mail-in voting and requires the use of voter ID.  But why was this done before the release of the frontline doctor video?  While the video was definitely created to inform the public and testify doctors using HCQ, I do believe that the patriots were expecting censorship from the MSN.  Many already knew about HCQ from day one of the president's announcement of the drug for treatment for the virus, and many have awoken from the mize of the media which discouraged the use of the drug through mass dissemination of false information through the Lancet and phony VA observational study, but not the majority of those still controlled by the mainstream media.  I do believe that this wasn't just about telling the truth.  I believe it was to expose the censorship and show the average person following the story how this coordinated cabal of the deep state, big pharma, and corrupt doctors knowingly deceived the people, resulting in mass deaths, the loss of businesses, the halting of the economy, loss of jobs.  Remember that you have to show the people, and now that fuse has been lit.  This has been a nightmare week for the Dems altogether because the Barr hearing had almost the same effect.  Nadler was also left exposed earlier in the week for publicly calling Antifa a myth.  But at the hearing, Nadler wasn't able to as easily dodge the facts.  I believe that exposing... of the riots to america is the lighting of the second fuse.  look at this post from dc jano rogan o'hanley.  for some reason dems think if they keep us all locked down surrounded by rights and wearing masks until november 3rd that we won't swarm the polls to vote for trump.  in reality all you're doing is pissing us off and creating thousands of new trump voters every day.  you'll see.  Think about the effect that the DNC supporting rioters has also had to the party.  Many already see the party as having gone way too left and becoming too extreme.  Everything that the Dems are doing is backfiring, exposing them.  On Monday, we will have the release of more potentially damning information from the Maxwell case that could implicate high-level politicians.  This is like a third fuse being lit to that same gunpowder keg that's sitting on top of a dam, and with each event, more fuses are lit on top of that.  In just a matter of weeks, we'll see the conclusion of the Durham and multiple other investigations, and then indictments will begin.  Justice is coming.  Now, before I wrap this video, I want to talk about something that started a few weeks back called Flags Out and the Silent Majority.  As you probably saw on Twitter and other platforms, there's been a movement to display flags in front of your home as a show of solidarity.  I think this is great, but I think we should take it further.  I think we should start a movement to encourage patriots to adorn the flag in any way they can, in their house, their car, wearing a hat, a pin.  I've got to go to work every day wearing a mask and I choose to wear the American flag for thousands of people to see.  Then tweet it, post it, and let's do this until the election and show how united we really are.  I'll do my part and post this and try to reach out to as many YouTubers as I can.  Thank you again for watching.  You guys are the reason I do this.  If you do want to show support, please like, please share, please subscribe.  And you can also follow the channel on Twitter, Parler, or add me on Facebook.  I'll also be setting up a BitTube account this week as a backup, and I'll announce it on Saturday.  I'll post it on every platform so you know, and hopefully they'll subscribe.  I want to end this on a light note with a video shared by Dan Scavino on Twitter highlighting some of Barr's testimony.  Thank you for watching.  My name is Richard, and this is If You Only Knew. ",
