            "text": "Gang!  Gang!  Game over for you devil rappers.  Prostitute rappers, all y'all be straight cappers.  I fell asleep up in y'all albums, they was straight nappers.  Y'all pittin' money over God, so y'all gotta back us.  We don't listen to Lecrae, cause he a fake Christian.  I'm just keepin' it a hundred, dog, I ain't dissin'.  How you claim to be a God, but support abortion?  But you quiet when you look on TV and two gays kissin'.  Your boys talk.  a good talk, but y'all face missin'.  God is love, but his rap's true, you can't say different.  They say I'm brassy, calm down, they think my break's missin'.  If people won't try brassy, he brought a thing with him.  How you making Christian raps, but ain't talking scripture?  Cardi B gots, he's on TikTok wanting to be strippers.  Future got all y'all sons wanting to be addicts.  The baby got all y'all sons wanting to be killers.  Lil Uzi got all the kids wanting to be depressed.  Y'all about to be young, there's a grown man wearing a dress.  Lil Yachty too, but it's for the money, I guess.  And I said what I said, so just say less.  Fat.  Man, it's time to rap about keeping your legs closed.  Say that for marriage.  Don't ask me why, cause God said so.  Pac said keep your head up.  Y'all got your head low.  Only fans.  Y'all do anything for bread, though.  I'm sorry, but a lot of things I see is I. Women want your Beyonce more than they want your guy.  Rihanna, too, but they all demons just in disguise.  God wins in the end, though, so I'm not surprised.  I hype Melissa up knowing she need to lose weight.  Obesity ain't cool, dawg.  That ain't up for debate.  And I'm a Christian American male and I'm straight.  Everybody try to cancel me, but they can't.  Game over for you devil rappers.  Prostitute rappers.  All y'all be straight cappers.  I fell asleep up in y'all albums.  They was straight nappers.  Y'all putting money over God.  So y'all got to bounce.  We don't listen to.  look great to see a fake Christian.  I'm just keeping it a hundred dog.  I ain't dissing.  How do you claim to be a guy by support abortion?  But you quiet when you look on TV and two gays kissing.  Yo, shout out to everybody that support me.  A lot of y'all requested merch for me, and I finally have merch at BrysonCreates.com.  Thank y'all so much for 100,000 subscribers on YouTube.  I love y'all.  Trump 2020, God first. ",
