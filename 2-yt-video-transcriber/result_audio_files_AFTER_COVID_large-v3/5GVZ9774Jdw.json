            "text": "let's get right into it and we'll start with number one which is basically if we kind of like you then we're going to share everything that we can about you with our girlfriends with our closest girlfriends.  anyway we will obsess about you.  we will share way too much information not specifically intimate details necessarily but we will definitely talk about you a lot and we'll even think about potential future with you and what that might look like.  So, that's the first tidbit.  Now, stay tuned because some of these are going to get pretty juicy.  Number two, I'm going to skip number two because that's a juicy one.  Let's go to number three.  I'll share number two later on in the video if you stick with me.  Number three, we evaluate everything you say, do, post, don't do, don't post, like.  So, we are super hyper vigilant about paying attention to what you're doing in the world when we kind of like you.  So, if you put a like on Ashley's photo of her at the gym or at the beach we're going to wonder if you like Ashley.  Now, that doesn't mean you should change.  your behavior necessarily depends on where you are in a courtship or relationship.  But just know that even though we might pretend not to be paying attention.  we are hyper, hyper paying attention to whatever you're doing.  Number four, okay this one's a little bit juicy.  But if a girl has been with a lot of guys which is subjective I suppose.  But whatever she thinks you'll think is a lot of guys she's not going to want to share that with you.  She's not going to want you to know that she's been with as many guys as she maybe has been especially if that number is something she can count on her hand.  more than once etc, etc.  So, the reality is that even though with feminism there's a lot more freedom for women to be open about sexuality with their bodies and everything else biologically the reality is that men still prefer women who haven't been as promiscuous.  You know if you're looking for someone well if you want to just hook up you do but if you're looking for someone for a long-term relationship you prefer a woman who's actually been a little bit selective which shows that she has high standards.  So, definitely if she has gone through a period of her life where she's been more promiscuous she's going to be hesitant to want to share that with you.  Number five along those lines is she will not want to share with you anything that might turn you off.  So, she's going to play her cards pretty close until she gets to know you better.  And she might even not share some of these things ever and you'll have to discover them.  So, some of the things that might turn you off would be if she's got medical conditions or she's got mental conditions or if she's got bad friendships or has had bad relationships especially if it's her fault.  If she doesn't have a job or if she's in debt or she has a terrible relationship with her family.  So, anything where you might negatively judge her she's going to hold back on sharing that information with you.  Number six, now this one's going to be a bit of a surprise but women don't want you to know that even though they are hypergamous, we are hypergamous to some degree which means that we are attracted to money, power, status, good looks, intelligence, the whole you know Chad Tyrone qualities.  we will compromise on many of those if you make us happy.  And I'm going to do a separate video on how to keep a woman happy without compromising yourself.  So, if you're interested in that definitely put a comment below.  And by the way if you like this video like, share, subscribe and click notifications so you don't miss any of my Just the Tip Tuesday videos.  And as well with this one is that if you meet her standards which aren't necessarily all of those hypergamous things they could be very specific things.  If you meet her say top five which you should know about which is in my wake up to love program and if you haven't taken that yet you definitely have to take that.  Well, you don't have to take that but you'd benefit by taking it for sure.  Anyways, so if you meet her standards which might not be what you think they are then she can be content with you.  Now, the reason why she doesn't want you to know this is because she doesn't want you to slack.  She doesn't want you to just get lazy in every area and not even try.  Okay, next one.  Okay, number seven you're going to love this one.  Well, you might not love it but you're going to appreciate the information in it.  So, number seven is that women keep track of points differently than men do.  So, for example, you plan a romantic dinner, you buy a new suit, you get your hair cut, you put on the cologne she likes, you pick her up you take her to the restaurant you make sure that she's seated comfortably.  you even arrange for the restaurant to create a special dessert for her and you take her home.  there's candles and you know you go the whole nine yards right.  So, you're thinking dude I have accumulated like nine or ten points tonight for sure for every single thing that I did right wrong unfortunately.  So, for a woman that evening counts as one point.  Maybe if it's really spectacular it'll be one really, really strong point but she counts points differently.  So, that whole evening is counted as an amazing point but that doesn't mean you can rob the piggy bank tomorrow and start getting lazy because you think you're ahead of the game.  So, better to know because then you know.  Okay, number eight.  This is especially important if you're in a long-term relationship.  Women typically require higher amounts of stimulation just physical mental emotional.  the works than men do after they're in a relationship.  Then some yes there are exceptions but here's the reality of what usually happens.  Once you get comfortable in a relationship whether you're just dating or you've been seeing each other for a while or you're living together or you're married men slack off.  you're like you're the hunter.  you've got your game and now you can just sit back chill and relax.  and you forget to continue to do the things that turned her on in the beginning.  You forget to continue to do the things that made her happy in the beginning and that will need to continue to make her happy now and in the future.  So, you need to keep that in mind that she doesn't want you to think that she's higher maintenance than she is by nagging, but eventually she will get to nagging.  That reminds me of like a little saying, you know why women outlive men?  Because we nag you to death.  Okay, well, anyways.  So, that's the thing.  and it's not that we don't want you to know that we need higher amounts of stimulation and variety and all the rest, but we just don't want to come off as high maintenance.  And really if you have to compare that men to women in this department we are kind of high maintenance but that's across the board.  So, you're just going to have to get used to that one.  And this is especially important if you've slacked in an area that was originally a selling feature for her.  So, here's a typical one.  that happens is that I'll go, I'll do the reverse.  actually because this happens also in the reverse like, so when men slack then women start to slack you don't get the thing you really want which is often physical intimacy.  So, she will sometimes gain weight.  maybe you lose a job and you don't start looking for one again.  It's a little bit challenging to do you know during the pandemic but these are generalities.  you have to look at what was a real selling feature for her at the beginning and you need to be able to step up and keep up with that without her asking you.  Because if you don't and it continues for any length of time she will start to unconsciously.  usually it starts with unconscious wonder what else is available on the market.  If the product that she bought isn't meeting her needs.  If the warranty has run out then she is going to wonder what else is available.  Be very careful if she starts losing weight working out and cuts her hair.  Yeah, that's for another video as well.  So, that brings us to number nine.  If your warranty is running out because you're not doing the things that you used to do that were really important to her in the relationship that's when her eye will wander.  She will consider cheating even if it's not conscious.  she will look around at what's available.  She doesn't want you to know this.  she just hopes that you will actually step up your game.  And she will ask you in many different ways usually by nagging which is ineffective but you need to pay attention to that anyways because even if she can't communicate effectively with you you need to pay attention to the signs that something needs to change or it's not going to be a happy ending if you know what I mean.  So, pay attention to her requests and she may not be requesting something specifically that she wants but if she's generally upset then you kind of need to look at yourself and say okay, where have I kind of slacked in the relationship?  Am I keeping up?  And again, I'll do another video on how to keep a woman happy so that you can keep your woman happy and then you'll be happy because then there'll be more happy endings in your world.  Everybody likes a happy ending and because she might not even know what her real needs are you should watch my understand women playlist.  I'll put a link below.  Okay, number 10. and then don't forget we're going to go back to number two the juicy one.  So, number 10 is We don't want you to know or we don't want to have to tell you.  We just want you to do this.  We want men to seduce us.  Amen.  We want our man to seduce us.  We want a man who is good at seduction.  We want a man who's had some experience or who at least seems like he's had some experience because just like you, we also enjoy physical intimacy and want to be seduced.  happy just know that.  to keep her happy then it's good for you to learn the art of seduction.  And the other part of this is that when you're good at seduction it gives her permission to be seduced.  She can go into her feminine and relax and allow you to lead and she trusts that you're going to lead in the right direction to your mutual satisfaction and pleasure.  There is a reason why the Fifty Shades of Grey movie and books are very popular.  If you look at the theme there it's basically the dominant male and that allows her to submit safely.  And this is whether you're in a long-term or short-term relationship.  Okay, so what was number two?  This leads us to number two.  Number two is no matter how hot, I'm going to give you a bonus tip on the word hot at the end here.  But no matter how hot, beautiful, sexy, attractive a woman is almost all women are insecure about their bodies or particular parts of their bodies or particular intimate parts of their bodies.  So, definitely once you get physically intimate with a woman you want to make her feel secure and comfortable being in her birthday suit with you by complimenting specific parts of her body that you like.  And I can't go into how to do that because I'll get punished here.  on YouTube.  But it's important to know that you want to make sure that she feels comfortable.  And definitely don't forget to get my wake up to love program where you will learn more about how to be your best self.  that works for you but that also works for women.  I'll put a link below.  Now, here's my little extra tip on just the tip on the word hot.  More women prefer to be called beautiful than hot when you were in the courting stage or sexy, sexy is okay too.  But if you go to hot, hot is more objectifying and definitely overtly sexual.  Hot means you're turned on which is great once you've already got to that point with her.  But if you haven't then it feels less intimate emotionally than if you call her beautiful or if you call her even sexy.  If she's wearing something particularly sexy sexy is great.  unless she's under 25 or very insecure then she's going to love the word hot.  But if she's pretty insecure about herself you're better off to wait to use hot.  and this is individual.  so you want to ask her about this word.  Personally, I don't like it at all.  but if you're not sure use sexy and then you can even ask her gosh you look hot or whatever but do you prefer sexy like?  so just ask her once you get to that stage.  but if you use beautiful or sexy especially beautiful almost all women want to be called beautiful.  if they're naked they definitely want to be called beautiful.  so there you go.  those are the 10 secrets women.
