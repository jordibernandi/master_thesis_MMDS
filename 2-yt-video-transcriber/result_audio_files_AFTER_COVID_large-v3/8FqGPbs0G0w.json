I got this the day after I talked to Joe.  I'm sure that's not the result he was going for.  My name is Jerry Wayne, and all I wanted to do is ask a presidential candidate a question.  I didn't intend to start a fight.  All I did was ask Joe how he was going to win over the union vote when he's planning on coming after our guns with Beto O'Rourke.  Hell yes, we're gonna take your AR-15, your AK-47.  I watched a video where he wanted to make assault weapons, or America's most popular rifle, illegal.  So I asked him about it.  Instead of answering me honestly, he acted like he never said it at all.  You are actively trying to diminish our Second Amendment right and take away our guns.  You're full of shit. ",

Americans should be able to ask candidates seeking the highest office what's going to happen to their rights.  If they vote them into office, Joe Biden can call me all the names he wants.

I am sick and tired of having to defend the fact that we need guns to defend our homes and hunt wildlife.  I don't need an excuse to have a hundred rounds.  I've got the Constitution of the United States.  My goal is to actually bring this country together, not further divide us.  Many brave men, like my grandfather, who's a 96-year-old World War II veteran, bought so we could have these rights, not so politicians could stomp all over them.  For every gun-grabbing politician out there, I've got four words for you.  Don't tread on us.  I'm calling on all patriots to stand up to career politicians who have forgotten who they work for and whose rights they swore to protect.  We are in a different era now.  Challenging this opposition is not the way to win this battle, but rather opening our arms to the misinformed.  We will win this battle not by belittlement, but by education.  My name is Jerry Wayne, and I'm a proud member of the National Rifle Association. ",
