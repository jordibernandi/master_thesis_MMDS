            "text": "hello and welcome back to redirecting.  recently i covered a story where 19 black families purchased some land down in georgia and the plan is for them to turn this land into a safe haven city for black people.  now apparently they are experiencing some backlash from you know who People who don't like the idea, who are speaking out very verbally and very aggressively against the whole idea.  Now, I think there is a big misunderstanding on the parts of these people who are speaking out against the efforts of this group.  Or should I say, it's not really a misunderstanding.  It is what you call playing dumb.  pretending like they don't know what's going on or why these people have made the choices that they are making or that they have made, should I say.  Now, we read some of the comments and I'm not gonna provide any advertising for this particular website because it is a website that is geared towards racial division, okay?  They don't like people with certain skin color.  And when you read through the comments, it is very clear that they don't.  They totally just mixed up the whole story.  Now you have these 19 black families who talked about the danger, the oppression, the discrimination, and just all of the things that so-called black people have had to endure for hundreds of years.  We're not talking about a brief moment in time where we've had to endure certain things, but we're talking about centuries, right?  And so what they are saying is that we are tired of it, right?  One of the commenters said they were talking about the women's images and how they were overweight and different things like this, saying this chick looks like she's 400 years old.  Yeah, I guess she looks like she's 400 years old because she referenced one of the people who bought the land.  She referenced the fact that our people have been oppressed in America for 400 years.  And so they're talking about, you know, trying to affix that as if, if you're not actually 400 years old, then how can you attest to what your ancestors went through?  That is one of the most idiotic statements.  We know what our ancestors have gone through, you see, and they know too.  But there is this thing where they like to try to play dumb and pretend, pretend like they don't know.  what we've gone through, what we experienced.  There were some more harsh comments as well.  Comments that are, in my opinion, some of them are kind of threatening, you see.  But they have been allowed to get away with just saying anything threatening to us and no one's gonna do anything about it.  And even sometimes when you attempt to try to protect yourself against the possibility of these threats then some kind of way their system figures a way to put it all on you.  you see even though for the past four hundred years who's been the threat to whom?  i'll let y'all answer that in the comment section who has been the greatest threat to whom in this country, okay?  These are the kinds of conversations that many have been having for years.  We get gaslighted, we get ignored, we get the old get over it statement thrown at us many times over.  This family, or these families, should I say, these 19 families that have come together.  They wanted to create something.  And one of the commenters made reference.  They said, what if they tried to do the same thing?  Then it would be all kinds of backlash and all of this.  But what they don't realize is you do have the same thing already.  You just don't call it that.  You redline communities.  You keep people out of communities.  You see people.  they don't understand that we know, it's almost as if they don't think that we know that we have doors slammed in our faces or that opportunities are blocked.  And they act as if we don't know because they will put it in the ad, equal opportunity employer, or they'll say fair housing authority.  They'll say all these things in the ad, but they know that in their mind, there's no fair housing, there's no equal opportunity.  They know that that article doesn't make the decision or those words don't make the decision, but it is made by them.  And so they want to keep you out of a place.  they do.  Simple as that.  They do.  If they want to keep you out, that is exactly what they do.  And so to try to pretend like you don't know that there is oppression, that is a form of manipulation or they figure if they don't own up to it, no one can accuse them of it.  Now, some of you, you get frustrated when you hear us talk about these things.  But when we go to websites, you all are constantly telling us to be quiet, get over it, stop talking about these things, stop stirring the pot.  But when we go to websites such as this particular one, All I'll tell you is it starts with a B. That's all I'm going to say, okay?  I'm not going to provide any advertising for them, but many of them, you go to their websites and they have it right on their pages and they just spill it all out.  You look in the comment section, thousands of comments, not one positive.  All of the comments are geared towards the perpetual hatred of calling us all kinds of names, doing all kinds of things because the purpose is and the environment on that website is to create exactly what we're looking at, you see?  And yet, you all want us to be quiet, but you're not going over there and telling them to be quiet.  See, many of us, we are responding to that or, get this, in my case, I don't go over there and respond.  I don't even deal with their websites.  Someone else shared it and I was reading the comments, but what I do is I like to wake up my people concerning these things, those who are asleep thinking that the world is fair and honest now.  some of our people are really that simple-minded to where they think that the world is fair and honest and my job and the jobs of many others is to give them that wake-up call.  this is why or one of the reasons why we call this channel redirecting because we need to help to redirect our minds and our focus to reality because many of our people have been swooped up in la la land and that's where they dwell.  They don't understand that there is a real world out here with real consequences and real situations that we must deal with on a daily basis.  And so that is my job here at redirecting to wake up those who are sleepers concerning this world and society and just so many other things that are happening.  Right.  But anyway, I just wanted to talk about the backlash, of course, There's a lot more, and you can all just imagine what is being said in the comments section on these websites.  These people have made it clear that they can't stand us, okay?  And my message is not for those of you who already know this, so you don't have to keep telling me in the comments section.  I'm not surprised by these things.  I know this is nothing new.  again my message is not for you.  it is for those who are not in the know.  just because you are in the know doesn't mean that sally or bob or tyrone.  sally is not a good name for one of us is it?  um let's go with brenda.  okay it doesn't mean that brenda is in the know because you are okay.  tyrone might still be in the twilight zone so it is our job to wake them up to reality.  They are receiving backlash over this black community because people really don't like to see us come together.  They can't stand it.  They don't like to see us prosper.  I mean, we've shared stories about things that have happened to us in the past when we lived in Michigan.  I mean, some tripped out things that a lot of people would, I mean, a lot of them would shake their heads.  You know, as a matter of fact, we had a neighbor in Michigan, a white neighbor who was really shocked at some of the things that we told them.  They couldn't believe it.  We were like, this is our reality.  But for them, they're like, oh my word.  Are you serious?  Yes, we are serious.  Yes, we are serious and people think that we're supposed to just shove this stuff out of our mind, get over it and move on.  Guess what?  Some of us do move on, but we still remember.  Okay.  We move on, but we do remember because we have to understand who we are dealing with at all times.  It doesn't matter if you're black or white because enemies come in black and white.  Okay.  With that, I am out. ",
