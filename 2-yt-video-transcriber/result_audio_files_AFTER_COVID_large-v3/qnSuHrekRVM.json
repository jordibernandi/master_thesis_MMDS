So let's take another look at this video Jehovah's Witnesses released about the LGBT community.  Let's get into it.  This video was released a few years back.  Actually, it came out around the time Trump was first being elected.  Of course, political involvement is strictly forbidden in the Jehovah's Witnesses religion, but they keep up with politics sometimes because they are convinced that Armageddon is coming any five minutes now, and they want to be ready for it when it happens.  This clip was released in full, and it wasn't 100% about LGBT issues.  The beginning part is about political involvement, but of course, it all routes back to the same ideas.  Anyways, let's watch the clip and see what they have to say. ",

People who were inside the religion at some point, like me, might not even notice it at first.  But everything is very slow.  They all have a similar personality.  It's all very strange and hard to put a finger on.  At any rate, this is how a lot of Jehovah's Witnesses act.  It's the defining feature of a cult.  Do they modify your personality to make you behave in a specific way?  That's really what makes a cult a cult.  This is the personification of how they want their members to act.  Also, I don't know if anybody else noticed, but there are no women sitting in this room of leadership.  That's because women are viewed as inferior, or at the very least, separate but equal, which is inferior in practice.  Women aren't allowed to have any part in leadership or teaching.  As 2 Timothy 2.12 says, I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man.  She must be quiet.  I guess they take that verse pretty seriously.  Anyways, let's continue. ",

The reality of this is nobody really gives a shit about what you believe.  Leave them alone and they'll leave you alone.  That's all LGBT people want anyways.  It's an inclusionary philosophy.  They want to try to counteract and reverse the damage religion does to people's lives.  More specifically, they want to reverse and counteract the damage that religion does to LGBT lives.  For centuries, even millennia, Christians have been an oppressive force against all kinds of minorities.  It's never leading the way in morality.  When the US was dealing with slavery, what was happening in the church?  The default position was that slavery was generally good and endorsed by the Bible.  They even made up a myth about how it started, something the Mormon church believes today, or at least something they believed until recently.  It's hard to get any information about it out of them, so I'm led to believe they're ashamed of it.  The reason they didn't let African Americans in the church as full members for almost 150 years is because of something they called the Curse of Cain.  This is a fabricated doctrine that Baptists in the 1800s subscribed to too.  Genesis 4 talks about how Cain was marked by God as a result of him killing Abel, and nobody really knows what the mark was exactly.  but the Mormon and Baptist churches believed that it was dark skin.  It was passed down through the generations and they used it to justify their mistreatment because their ancestors committed the first sin.  Eventually the Baptist church split into the Southern Baptists and the Northern Baptists, eventually just called Baptists, over the doctrinal disagreements.  But the point is that hatred and bigotry within the church go back a long way.  The church has never been the moral leader.  They have always been the institution holding society back.  We have to drag them kicking and screaming into a new age every single time.  And every time they're dragged into the new age, kicking and screaming, they cry that they're being persecuted.  They say people are being mean to them.  The biggest institution in the  U.S.,  maybe even the world, with more power and wealth than any other group.  And they're being persecuted by people because they aren't allowed to mistreat people anymore.  It's honestly a disgusting fucking joke.  Anyways, let's continue watching. ",

Some people are obsessed with living in the past.  I honestly don't get it.  Morality is subjective.  But there are certain moral precepts that we all agree on.  Murder is wrong.  Lying is wrong.  That kind of thing.  We've come up with moral precepts that we need to live in a society.  Like the idea that your right to swing your fist ends at the tip of my nose.  You can swing your fist wherever you want.  But the moment it reaches my nose, you're violating my rights.  Preventing you from swinging your fist around would be violating your rights.  But your rights don't extend past mine.  That's what society is based on.  Think of it this way.  Gay marriage doesn't affect you in any way, shape, or form, right?  But preventing gay marriage does affect other people.  So when politicians try to eliminate gay marriage, they're imposing their moral values onto other people.  They're effectively swinging their fists at people's faces.  They're violating their rights.  I don't care what your religious moral beliefs are.  If it doesn't hurt anybody, then you don't have a right to prevent me from doing it.  That's the moral framework that the United States was built upon.  Wearing a seatbelt not only protects you, but it makes car accidents potentially less severe.  You're risking other people's lives by not wearing a seatbelt.  Not just your own.  Wearing a mask doesn't just affect you.  It affects the people around you.  Going into a store and refusing to wear a mask is you swinging your fist at the tip of my nose.  According to the U.S.  Constitution, I have a right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  You're infringing on my right to life by refusing to make the smallest concession, wearing a mask.  and you're infringing on everybody else's rights by standing against gay marriage.  That doesn't even require a concession.  All you have to do is nothing.  Instead, Jehovah's Witnesses and other religious organizations are determined to drag society down with them.  They're determined to force people to live like they do.  As I said, it's honestly fucking disgusting.  And every battle we've won against people who were determined to keep everything exactly the same as it was 6,000 years ago in Bible times has been paid for in blood.  We will get there.  We've been making slow progress toward a better society.  One where consenting adults can get married if they want.  But people like Jehovah's Witnesses will prevent it at all costs.  And it's almost like the moment we feel secure, like we've won the battle, it all comes back into focus all over again.  Anyways, that's all I've got for you.  Don't forget, if you like what I do and you want to see me continue to do it, you can support me in a few ways.  First, there's Patreon.  That's probably the best way.  But if you want to get something back for your support, you can check out my Etsy store.  As I said, I designed these Christmas tree toppers the other day.  They're Mario Star, the 3-Up Moon, and the Fire Flower.  More designs might be coming in the future, so keep a lookout.  All links can be found in the description and the pinned comment, as always.
