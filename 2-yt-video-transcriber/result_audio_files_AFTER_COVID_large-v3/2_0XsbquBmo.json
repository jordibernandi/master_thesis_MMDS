            "text": "Probably the most important one.  Scenario seven.  The marriage contract.  A woman says, if you really care about me, you'll sign a contract giving me legal rights to half of all your things if we ever have a falling out.  Or in parentheses, you know, or if I ever decide I want out.  Now this one I'm obviously being a little, she would never be this blunt with it.  But the whole idea with the marriage contract where a lot of guys that, when I say guys that even are like kind of against marriage and then they eventually got married.  And that really is interesting to me because I'm always kind of like, okay, what made you finally do it?  And a lot of guys say like, well, hey, you know, I knew it was really important to her.  I knew that getting married was something that she really wanted to do.  So I did this to make her happy because that's all she wanted.  And she's been a good girlfriend or whatever it is.  But if you think logically about this and you step back and you go, okay, well, why do you want to get married?  Well, a lot of women will say, well, marriage shows that you're committed to me.  It will make me feel better knowing that you're actually committed.  Your love, you're telling the world that you love me.  So again, and then a lot of guys fall into that.  They kind of are like, okay, it makes sense.  I know she really wants to be married.  Everyone asks her, when are you going to get married?  So I'm going to do that.  But if you really stopped it back and asked a logical question, and if you're like, hey, if you truly love me, if you truly love me, then getting married or just having it on paper really shouldn't matter, should it?  If you truly love me as a person, then the most important thing is that we spend every day together or we have this committed relationship.  But if you truly love me, why do you need a marriage paper to signify that?  Okay.  If you thought logically that would be the train of route you would go.  But again, a lot of guys go in a lot.  And I understand why guys get pressured from both sides.  Guys get pressured from guys, from women.  Um, they get pressured about.  why haven't you proposed yet?  Why haven't you asked her?  Oh, you're so lucky to be with her.  But if you really start and thought about it.  If we were rock solid as a person, if she's so rock solid that I have no qualms about marrying her, well, think about that in a different perspective.  If you were so rock solid that you have no worries that she's going to screw you over in divorce court, if you're that rock solid, then why do you even need to get married?  If you're that rock solid, then not getting married, you should be totally fine and she shouldn't have to worry.  Because you guys are rock solid, right?  But a lot of guys don't think and ask that logical question.  So now, think of scenario seven, the marriage contract.  Now think about this, all right?  A business contract.  Just imagine this, guys, with a man.  Okay, imagine a guy says to you, hey, if you really care about me, you'll sign a contract, you'll sign a business contract with me, give me legal rights to half of all of your things, half of everything you've worked for your entire life, if we ever have a falling out, or if I just decide I want out, and if you knew and you were about to sign a business contract with a guy, and you knew that if you guys had a falling out and you wanted to end the business, that that guy could go to court and that he would have a majority of people on his side just from the start.  Again, in marriage court, and a lot of guys will say after they've been through it, it's a lot more obvious.  I've never been through it, so it wasn't obvious to me until I dug in more.  But in marriage court, it's like with the woman, if you guys ever have a falling out, And know that also when you go into that court that everyone's going to take her side.  Think about that.  Would you ever get in a business contract with a guy and he's just like, hey, by the way, hey, dude, let's just decide, hey, let's just sign a little contract.  Let's sign a friend agreement here that if anything ever happens and we decide we're not friends anymore, I can take half of all your things and most people in court are going to back me up.  But if you sign this business contract, what you're doing is you're making me feel better.  You're showing that you're committed to me.  Would you ever logically be like, okay, yeah, okay, cool, yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, let's sign this contract.  Let's do that.  Yeah, guy to guy, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, I trust you, we'll be fine.  Why not?  Why not?  No, no guy would do that.  Logically, no guy would do that.  Yet, that is the same type of scenario that so many guys fall into that know, a lot of Not a great deal for men.  A lot of guys know this, even if they don't know, know this, even if they haven't looked into it, even if they don't know the stats, even if they don't understand like Duluth law and all of that stuff, like how they don't understand how biased the courts are.  They just know from hearing stories and marriage is risky because you get divorced me and take half my things.  A lot of guys know kind of deep down, but they're willing to do it anyway because they They just get talked into it versus if you looked at this other scenario, you would never do it.  You would never sign that up as a business contract because you would think logically about it.  You'd think smart about it.  But with women, we throw logic and reason out the window because she's a girl.  And that has to do with putting her on a pedestal.  You're treating her differently simply because she's a woman.  No other thing could explain it.  Getting married for a woman is like winning the lottery.  Marriage for a man is like a prison sentence.  And you know what is important to also understand about this is that if you read female dating strategies, what you'll find is a lot of married women talk about it like it's a prison sentence for her.  Like, oh, marriage was so rough for me.  It was so bad for me.  Oh, I had to be with this guy my whole life.  I could have been out with all these other men that wanted me.  This guy's lucky to have me.  So she almost talks about it like it's a prison sentence for her, but in reality, just like this, it's winning the lottery.  She has no losses that can come from that because if she wants out, she can get out and leave with a lot of assets that were not hers beforehand.  And if it's good or even if it's not good, but she wants to stay in, she can stay in because the guy knows if he leaves, she's gonna come away with a lot of assets.  But the crazy thing is that when women are going into marriage with all the benefits and they're talking on female dating strategies about it's like a prison sentence for her, then you have so many more women that are in marriage and then they're going, oh, it is a prison sentence for me.  And they're thinking more and more, they're giving themselves an excuse to divorce the guy because they buy into it being a prison sentence for her.  And the guy gets double whammied because not only does he get treated like crap, but then at the end of it, he gets screwed over.  See, I hear certain guys that will \u2013 or just certain people that will dis on MGTOW or Red Pill or whatever in the big \u2013 especially if they say MGTOW.  Men go in their own way and they go, well, you guys sure talk about women a lot.  Well, it's because if you don't understand this stuff \u2013 If you then social conditioning is so heavily influenced in all the women's favor that even if you're a guy that has been a lifelong bachelor and you have no one else that you see that has a like mind as you eventually you start to think that you're the crazy one.  You're like, well, everyone else is doing it and you can see why guys dip into it and do that stuff.  So the reason why it's so important that MGTOW or Red Pill talks about women specifically is because if you don't hear this before it's too late, then you'll hear this after it's too late.  And by that time, a lot of damage has already been done.  You've already been through the meat grinder.  Oprah didn't marry.  Yeah.  Guys, I think Oprah's going to go down.  Go down as in arrested.  I'm going to put on my tinfoil hat here and just say I believe that she is one of the biggest child traffickers, human traffickers, and accomplice of that of people that we have heard of.  And I know that might sound crazy to some of you guys, but just watch.  I bet you Oprah is going to go down as well with a lot of other people, man.  Not what they seem.  A lot of the celebrities are not what they seem.  Oh yeah, I love the fact that Adele got screwed about Tom.  Yeah guys, I really think that the only way that things will ever change again is women getting screwed in court system.  And then them being like, wow, this is so unfair.  Because you guys know, there could be.  There could be 100 suicides by men, and there could be one suicide by a woman, and that one suicide by a woman is going to get aired all over the mainstream media.  There's going to be articles about it, about we need to watch out for women with mental health problems.  So there could be 100 guys getting screwed in child court, family court.  If one woman gets screwed, you're gonna hear about it.  But again, we have to have more women get screwed over before laws change because that, I mean, we all know this at this point, right?  That's the only time that you're gonna get, that there's gonna be publicity and notice about it.  Adele getting screwed.  Stuff like that.  Was it Tom Arnold and who did he marry?  Not Roseanne.  What's her name?  Rosie O'Donnell.  Is that who it was?  I think that he came out ahead in that one as well, but there's so few that you can actually... Think about it.  Yeah, Queen of the New Age Movement.  Yeah, Oprah.  Yeah, man, I read a couple books.  I read a book by Oprah, Things I Know For Sure.  I read it like two or three times years ago.  I used to think she was a cool person.  I thought she was a good role model.  I was bought into the Kool-Aid, especially when I was a teacher, right?  She seemed like, oh yeah, she wants to help teachers.  Yeah, I learned a lot of stuff about her.  Okay, so guys, in conclusion here, in conclusion, Treat her like an equal.  Use this filter, other than when you're actually having sex with her, no homo, use this filter of.  if she were a guy, would I still be doing this?  Would I still be putting up with this?  Would I still be bending over backwards?  Would I still be complying to this if this was just a guy?  And if you ask that question and you answer that self going, no, I wouldn't do that, then don't do that with women.  And I'm telling you guys, not only is that a message for sanity, a message for safety, but that's also a message for success with women.  And the more you dig into basically anything... whether that's health, nutrition, whether that's dating, relationships, whatever in life you dig into, what you typically find is that whatever the mainstream narrative that most people talk about is, what you typically find is the best way to do things is pretty much counterintuitive to what everyone else tells you to do.  Whatever the mainstream narrative it is, Typically, the best thing is counterintuitive to whatever you think it is.  That's how much brainwashing that happens in all fields of things.  So when we talk about this filter of if she were a guy, would I still be doing this?  When I tell you guys what Chad and Tyrone do to get women to do things for them that women won't do for anyone else, Chad and Tyrone mindset would be this and it would even be more tilted.  It would be because if you look at equality, that's a step in the right direction for blue-pilled simp men.  beta mon men step in the right direction is to go.  okay if this were a guy you know i was just going to think completely equal would i do this for him?  would i would?  i do this.  that's like the the first right step.  but then when you look into actual like biology and dynamics about what women actually find attractive then you find it actually tips even farther in the skill scale where um men know that they're the leaders and that women are the ones that should be working for them.  So even when I go equality, that's like the first step.  Well, really, when you really think about the actual relationship dynamic, it should be woman working for man's attention because he's the prize and all that.  And I know we talk about that in different kind of senses.  But yeah, Chad and Dairones will not only do this.  Was this an equal?  I wouldn't do that for them.  But they even go even further and go.  But also, I understand that women should be working for my attention.  I'm the leader.  She's the follower.  So it even goes a step further.  But to get that baseline set for sure is like, would I be doing this if this was a guy?  No, then I should not do this if it's a woman.
