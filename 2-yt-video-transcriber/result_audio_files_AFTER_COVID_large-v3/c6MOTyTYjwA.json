            "text": "Hey all, so you may have noticed that I've been on a bit of a hiatus for a while.  I kind of just needed some time off to try some new things, to kind of invest some energy into some other projects.  But I feel like I'm at a point now where I want to get back into making more Needs More Gay episodes.  And especially with everything going on right now with the Black Lives Matter protests and with the truly heinous police brutality we've been seeing going on in the US, I just really felt like I needed to do something to help out.  So on Saturday, June 13th at 7 p.m.  Eastern Time, I'm going to be hosting a charity stream on Twitch.  I'm going to be raising money for The Bail Project, which is a national nonprofit that provides free bail assistance and pretrial support to low-income people in the U.S.  This is one of the bail funds that benefits the Black Lives Matter protesters who have been arrested while speaking out against white supremacy.  This will be the first live stream that I have ever done in my life.  It is very exciting.  I'm going to finally finish playing Dream Daddy.  We're basically going to go until I have finished the game, and if there's time I might play some other games too.  I think it's going to be a really fun time.  I hope I see all of you there.  My Twitch channel is here, so be sure to go there Saturday, July 13th at 7 p.m.  Eastern.  I'll also be posting a reminder on my YouTube channel the day of.  So yeah, I'll see you then and stay safe.
