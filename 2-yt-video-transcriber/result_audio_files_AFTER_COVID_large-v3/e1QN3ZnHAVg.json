When we set up a code, when I have a moral code within me, which is something that I've spent a great deal of time thinking about, it's not an answer to everything.  So it's not just like a list of things.  It is a list of some things that are the result of a process, and it's the process that matters.  What I'm looking for?  there is an ideal.  The fact that I don't always meet that ideal says nothing more than I am an imperfect being, that occasionally I'm going to do something that isn't ideal.  There's no force required to do this.  It's already part of who I am.  If we were perfect, we wouldn't have needed a moral code in the first place because we would never make mistakes.
