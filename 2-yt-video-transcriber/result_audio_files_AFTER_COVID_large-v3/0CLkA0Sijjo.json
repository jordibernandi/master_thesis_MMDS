But he said, quote, there are people that don't think masks are good.  That's clearly not what the CDC director thinks since he said today that masks are important, powerful public health tool we have.  They could be even more protective against COVID than a vaccine.  So have any medical experts told the president that masks aren't good?  Or is he only citing non medical experts like he did last month? ",

It's recommended.  The president's continually recommended it from this podium, but he was just pointing out some of the unintended consequences, if not used appropriately. ",

Unfortunately, a bunch of you are very keen on doing selective editing of the president's quotes and not referring to the second half directly under that statement.  He talked about a waiter touching the mask, then touching a plate, and that being an unintended effect of wearing a mask.  That is an example of a mask not being used appropriately.

There's more that will be forthcoming.  And in aggregate, it's going to be a very comprehensive strategy, one where we're saving healthcare while Democrats are trying to take healthcare away, where we're making healthcare better and cheaper, guaranteeing protections for people with pre-existing conditions, stopping surprise medical billing, increasing transparency, defending the right to keep your doctor in your plan, fighting lobbyists and special interests, and making healthier and finding cures to diseases.  And those are the principles that will animate multiple stakeholders here at the White House who work on policy.  So our Domestic Policy Council and others are working on a health care plan.  Not the CDC director, not Bob Padlock, not Admiral Giroir.  None of them have any idea about the health care plan.  I'm not going to give you a readout of what our health care plan looks like and who's working on it.  If you want to know, come work here at the White House. ",
