            "text": "Charlotte, go ahead.  I wanted to ask about Section 230.  Is President Trump willing to allow a government shutdown over that in the National Defense Bill?  MS.  The President has made clear the importance of 230, and he \u2013 I would point you to his tweet about how that pertains to the NDAA.  One thing I would say, when you look at 230, just to explain for the American public exactly what that is, it's essentially a shield that is given to social media networks because they claim to be uh the public square.  but in the case of twitter twitter has become a publisher choosing to fact check certain content and when you're a publisher there are certain responsibilities with that.  you should not be immune from liability.  and when you look at what twitter has done on the ayatollah khomeini we were just looking at his twitter account before coming out here and just a few weeks ago the ayatollah khomeini of iran tweeted quote why is it a crime to raise doubts about the holocaust something not worthy of a flag by Twitter, which is despicable when you think about it.  Also, the Ayatollah has tweeted that Israel is a deadly cancerous growth that should be uprooted and destroyed, something that Twitter did not deem worthy of flagging or blocking in its entirety.  And in fact, Twitter executives defended that move in front of the Knesset.  This is a very important issue, one that there's even bipartisan agreement that something needs to be done.  So the president will be unashamed in fighting against that kind of vitriol that we see in very hateful language that Twitter is publishing.  Kristen.  Thank you, Kayleigh. ",

And I noted when you have other world leaders that are making calls for genocide and Twitter not finding that worthy of flagging or blocking.  Beyond that, you look at China, who's putting out disinformation.  China tweeted out, I believe it was six days ago, I think it was November 25th, that COVID-19 did not originate in Wuhan, something that was not deemed worthy of flagging by Twitter.  There are real grave concerns here, and the president stands by that.  And it also is worth noting that the president will always defend our military, ensure that we get adequate defense funding, as he's gotten $2.9 trillion so far.  But he is going to put the pressure on Congress to step up on this.  Christian.  Yeah, thanks, Kayleigh. ",
