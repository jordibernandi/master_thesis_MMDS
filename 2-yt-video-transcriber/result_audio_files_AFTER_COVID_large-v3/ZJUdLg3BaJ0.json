She is a nurse and her and her husband, Timothy Rohn live in a gated community.  He is a maintenance supervisor.  So Catherine was at the community pool, you know, with her children and some nieces.  But what happens when they show up, only them, The two Karens, yes, there's two Karens that showed up, Karen Belair and Karen Amisi.  Yes, both of them are named Karen, literally.  Karen is coming after you, double team Karens.  And they was questioning them about their resident car, but they didn't question none of the Mzungus about it, just the Hispanic woman and her black children, basically, that's who they questioned.  But I want you to see exactly what happened, because a Mzungu woman actually saw what was going on And she said, wait a minute, it's not right.  And she recorded it.

            "text": "So I understand why the brother was very upset.  He rightfully.  So you paying your mortgage, you're paying your homeowner association fees and those facilities are open to you and you have, you know, these, you know, bad built.  Oh my God.  Nasty looking Karen come up to you.  Literally her name is Karen coming up to you, bothering you about an ID.  Would you not seeing her, uh, bring whole Oompa Loompa self to other people and ask them for it.  Like leave people alone.  My God, man.  It's like people just trying to enjoy themselves.  You know, definitely a nurse.  She, she dealing with COVID and all of that.  And yet y'all just won't leave people alone.  Now, of course the brother's pissing.  You know, you see, you see that old security guard.  He's armed security actually.  So they will calm down, calm down, like calm down for what?  Like you sitting up there starting jump.  People just trying to just enjoy their day on a Sunday.  Right.  And, I always tell people this, you know, never get brand new to think those folks are on your side.  I'm talking about now, this is what I'm going to mention people outside of the black community.  Cause some, some people think that because they're not black, they don't, they're not going to deal with those folks.  Those folks don't like you at all.  And you think, and they just targeting us.  Trust me.  They, Oh, they, they coming back around.  You better believe they coming back around.  Because you a threat too.  You can go along and get along with everything else, but trust me, it don't work.  The black community can tell you it don't work.  But what ended up happening, they sent a letter to the homeowner association and the board wrote them back and said how they greatly apologized and they should not have happened.  They said they have disciplined the two Karens for what they'd done.  But discipline to me is fired.  They should have been fired for discrimination.  not disciplined because you're pointing out only the Hispanic and black people.  You're not pointing out the, the, the Muslim girls like yourself.  I mean you had a whole video pointing that out and they didn't get fired.  See right there, it's just not cool whatsoever.  But, you know, before you move in any neighborhood, I would tell you to do your research.  Make sure you do your research.  Find out, you know, what you can about that particular neighborhood and see if that's a good place for you.  I always say that because me, I don't want to live in no area where you got that kind of situation going on.  I just don't because it never turns out good for you.  You need to move somewhere where you definitely have a lot of brothers and sisters around and they got those neighborhoods.  or even if it's a neighborhood, there's a bunch of us and it's everybody, but you still have a good chunk of us there.  Then that's cool.  You know, cause I understand where they're at.  he got in certain pockets where we had in those States, but leave me a comment.  Let me know what you think about this particular story, uh, with these two Karens, you know, just being discriminatory.  Like I said, everybody in the whole world now know about Karen and, um, you know, we got to keep pointing them out. ",
