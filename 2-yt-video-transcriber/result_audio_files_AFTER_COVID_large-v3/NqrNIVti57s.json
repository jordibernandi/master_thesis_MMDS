            "text": "The contents of this video are going to be very difficult for most of you to watch.  If you are a person that gets easily creeped out by stuff like this, you probably should go on to another video at this time.  But for the rest of you who feel like you want to take a shot at watching this, I want to warn you, this is not easy to watch.  I promise you that.  And so I'm going to give you the top five creepiest Kenneth Copeland clips of 2020. here in this video.  Hey guys, your friend Spencer here.  Kenneth Copeland has been known for many years as a man who really, for the atheistic crowd and for people that have rejected Christianity altogether, Kenneth Copeland is the guy that they kind of look to for all of their sound clips, and there is a number of different spoof videos and satire involving Kenneth Copeland, much of it from the anti-Christian world, some of it from the Christian world.  the Lord knows that I have done my fair share of satire with many of these outrageous charismatic leaders and and it's it's.  of course it's funny to do all that stuff but but the things I want to show you in this video bring me no joy I kind of thought about.  could I maybe take a satire angle with the things that I'm about to talk about and in this video I decided not to because of just to me.  it's a serious thing.  this is a serious nature.  now.  I like satire.  I like having fun.  Nobody likes having fun more than I do.  But in this video, I want to just show you the things that this man is saying and try to expose the truth about what he is to the world.  I want the non-Christian crowd to know that Kenneth Copeland does not represent Christianity whatsoever.  Please do not think that he does.  He is not an accurate representation of Christianity.  His views are so outside of what has been called Orthodox Christianity, so far out of that, that he really doesn't represent it.  I think Kenneth Copeland is a mystic.  He is a spiritist.  And I do not think he is a Christian at all.  So I want to play with you one clip real fast that he was famous for.  And this was when Inside Edition kind of ambushed him and interviewed him.  And he got aggravated real quick.  And I want you to just see that it's almost as if you can see demons coming out of this man as he deals with these things.  So just watch this video with me.  I'll give some commentary along the way. ",

And I think her question was completely reasonable.  And to his credit, I think... his answer was fine.  But I want you just to see how he acts towards this woman.

I declare it in typical word of faith fashion.  And I want you just to see the things that he said during this time.  In the name of Jesus.  Oh, thank you, Jesus.  And I just want to stop right there.  I love how he cut off that guy.  That was very entertaining to watch.  But just notice the things that he's saying.  And this was earlier in 2020.

And so we'll see after that that his first declaration, his first demand as he stood in the office of the prophet of God, I'm saying that with quotations around it, it never came to being.  And so he did the same thing again just a few months later just to kind of take a second shot at declaring this whole thing to be over and see how it goes.  Almighty!  Almighty!  Strong!  Strong!  Southwind!  Southwind!  You see his eyes.  Heat.  He just acts crazy.  Burn this thing.  Burn this thing.  In the name of Jesus.  In the name of Jesus.  Satan, you bow your knee.

But I think this man has something going on spiritually of a demonic nature that has so warped his own mind that he's not even coherent.  I mean, this is the ramblings of a man who's lost touch with reality.  And now I understand we walk by faith, not by sight.  I understand that the Christian people operate by different principles than the world does.

And there comes a point where this is just demonic.  And this is not real laughter.  There's something in the spirit world going on in these people's lives.  It's very demonic.  Holy laughter and things of that nature is an obvious sign of the Kundalini spirit.  You can look at Third Adam, our documentary.  that we dealt with that, and just how they act so irrational, irate, and just do goofy stuff like this when they get filled with this false spirit called the Kundalini Spirit.  So let's just continue to watch.  And the whole church is on their feet laughing with him.  This is another one that just came up recently about him saying that if you've got a bald spot on your head, just declare your hair to grow and your hair will grow.

If somebody has a serious illness and they want to come and ask the church to pray for them, I am all for that.  Let's do it.  Let's all have a word of prayer for this man.  But to just put your hands on your head and declare... your bald spots to be gone and just say, hair grow.  That is not Bible Christianity.  That is more of a Hindu Eastern mystic type stuff.  The law of attraction, decree and declare.  If you speak it, then the words will become flesh.  That's all Eastern mystic talk.  And that's exactly what he's doing here in this video.  And so this is very troubling.  what he's into.  I want to just point this out to you guys.  I did send that to a few bald people, just in full disclosure.  Now, this is the one we made a video of just the other day about him mixing his blood with the blood of Jesus, and he actually will cut his hand in this video.  And it's very troubling.

Someone pointed out to me, it's almost like he acted like a vampire that just got a new fresh dose of blood in his system.  It's really spooky stuff what he's about to do. ",

            "text": "Okay, and so that is the top five creepiest Kenneth Copeland clips of 2020.  I want to say that this video brings me no joy.  I am not sitting here with some, you know, yeah, I told you so attitude.  But I want to point out to you that there are people in this world that Satan has risen up as his ministers, his preachers.  You see, God has preachers.  Satan has preachers too.  And it says there in 2 Corinthians 11, 13, the Apostle Paul warned us about people like this.  He says, And so if you'll notice there that Satan has what the Bible calls his ministers, his ministers.  And guys, I want to admonish you.  I want to encourage you.  This is a dangerous man.  This man, if you believe what he teaches, I have a tremendous amount of fear for your soul.  And I don't say that lightly.  I say that knowing that God is listening and knowing that I'll be held accountable for every word that I say.  In the end day, I understand that.  Kenneth Copeland is going to be a man that you do not want to follow.  And in many other videos I've done before, I have made the plea, you know, I'm not trying to get you to agree with everything on me.  And I'm not even trying to really make everybody in the world a Baptist because I know that may not be true.  A lot of people may not want to go that way, and that's fine.  I just want to point you towards Bible truth as much as I possibly can.  And guys like Kenneth Copeland are extremely, extremely dangerous.  You do not want to put your family into a church that has him to come preach.  You do not want to sit under a pastor that reads his books and follows his ministry.  You do not want to be around men like this.  If you are associated with a ministry that endorses him or supports him, you need to get your family out of that church.  People who follow Todd White.  Todd White says that Kenneth Copeland is one of the greatest men of God he's ever known, and he's fully endorsed him.  You do not want to be a part of that.  Also, at that meeting that I just showed you where Kenneth Copeland was cutting his own hand, Bill Johnson of Bethel Church was preaching at that meeting.  And so Bill Johnson is a part of this.  Everything that you just saw in these videos, Bill Johnson is linked to that.  and I know it gets to be.  it's kind of like a big spider's web of all these people connected to each other, and that can be very complicated and very hard to process all that information.  I get that.  But please, I'm begging you, get away from guys like Kenneth Copeland.  These people are modernist.  These people are dangerous.  And we've tried to put many good videos on our channel explaining all these ins and outs of theology and why these terms are meaningful and why these things should be talked about in our churches today.  So... I'm telling you, these people are ministers of Satan.  Kenneth Copeland is not just some guy that I disagree with.  Kenneth Copeland is a horribly, extremely dangerous man that will wreck you.  He will wreck you and wreck your children spiritually.  and poison their minds with this false teachings that he has.  Guys, please get away from these folks.  And if we can help you in any way, we want to.  But guys, subscribe to our channel.  We've got a lot of good videos like this coming out in the near future.  Please stick with us.  We're going to expose all of these people.  There's a number of them.  Benny Hinn, we're going to talk about Paula Whitemore, talk about Copeland.  There's another guy that's been going around the streets of the United States having all these revivals and stuff like that.  He's connected to Bethel.  We're going to deal more with Todd White, Copeland.  I've got a lot of Stephen Furtick videos coming out.  Listen, anything that is connected to Copeland and anything that is celebrated on platforms like TBN and things like that needs to be very skeptical.  You need to be very skeptical of them.  And so I want to throw that out there for you guys.  So guys, God bless you.  We love you.  And subscribe to our channel and we'll do many more videos like this in the near future.  But in the meantime, please stay away from Copeland.  He's a dangerous guy.  And we'll talk to you soon.  Thank you. ",
