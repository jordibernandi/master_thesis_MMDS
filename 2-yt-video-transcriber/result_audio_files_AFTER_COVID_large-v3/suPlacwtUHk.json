That was Trump lawyer Sidney Powell saying she's going to quote unquote release the Kraken in the looming case around the supposed stolen election where Joe Biden, the media, all of America's enemies, foreign and domestic, have stolen this election from Donald Trump.  And you have Lou Dobbs, a host on a major Fox business, you know, Fox News Network umbrella show, egging her on, saying that, oh, this is an awful moment.  I'm scared for the country.  Democrats will wake up and realize that they are Americans first and that this election is being stolen from them, too. ",

Biden won, sad Biden won, indifferent Biden won, but Biden won.  He's going to win 306 electoral college votes, the exact same Donald Trump won.  And rather than lose by three million, he's going to win by five and who knows, maybe even six million when every single vote is finally counted in all 50 states.  This election's over.  And Donald Trump and his cronies and his family and his most sycophantic supporters continue to try and effectively launch a coup against the American people.  And again, I don't want to sound like a broken record, but even if the coup fails, and I believe it will... It's still poisoning democracy because this sort of discourse isn't going to stop the second Trump is confirmed to have lost.  It's not like on inauguration day or when the electoral college officially votes and basically crowns Biden the next president that all of this will go away.  It's not.  Even if Fox tries to tamp it down, it's too late.  Trump supporters all over the United States by the millions will forever think incorrectly that this election was stolen and that will poison democracy.  And people like Fox News, companies like Fox News, people on Fox News have played a role in that.  They have nothing.  They have nothing.  I went over it this morning.  They have nothing.  Trump's lawyers and Trump's sycophants in the media, when they go onto Fox News, can say whatever they want.  But when they get into courtrooms, all of Trump's lawyers admit they have nothing.  Because you can't lie in court like you can lie on a Fox News Network stage.  You can't do it.  They have this Kraken, supposedly.  They would have released it already.  There is nothing here.  All you're seeing here is a desperate, anti-democratic, autocratic, flailing about by Trump, his family, and his goddamn shill lawyers.  They deserve nothing less than to be defeated at the polls, and they already have, but now, given their utter distaste for democracy, should be thrown into the dustbin of history forever.  And that includes people like Lou Dobbs that not only enable this, but encourage it on international television.  These people deserve nothing less than utter irrelevance. ",
