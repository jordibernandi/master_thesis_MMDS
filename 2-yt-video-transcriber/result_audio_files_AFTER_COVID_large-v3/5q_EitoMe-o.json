So we shouldn't be opening new discriminatory faith schools like this one.  that's unfortunately been given permission. ",

You're choosing pupils, in this case, on grounds of religion.  But we know from evidence across the country that when you're choosing on grounds of religion, you also end up sorting on grounds of ethnicity, on grounds of socio-economic advantage.  When admissions procedures are complicated or rely on parents taking some sort of positive action like church attendance to get their children in, you end up with the children of wealthier, better educated parents, better able to play the system, you end up excluding poorer children.  So selection in any proportion, on any ground, whether it's religion or anything else, creates discrimination in the system. ",

I mean, religion is something that divides people very often.  Sometimes it brings people together, but very often it divides people, and if you add that into our school system at a time when our society is more diverse than ever before, we'll be exacerbating that division rather than trying to heal it and bring people together.  So selection's bad, but that doesn't mean that more selection should just be OK. ",

            "text": "Faith School's examination performance is sometimes good, but as your report just then indicated, that's often because of the sort of covert selection that I talked about a moment ago, where if you introduce any sort of selection, you end up advantaging parents who are better off, more able to navigate the system.  It's true that some parents want religious schools, not many, only 8% of parents say that religion is a factor in their school choice.  But I think on balance, the aims of wider society in achieving integration and inclusion in diverse schools should outweigh the wishes of some parents for religious schools, especially as in this case in Peterborough, If they're a tiny, tiny minority, I mean, most people who responded to the consultation in Peterborough who were from the local area and who were parents didn't want religious schools.  And that's actually the mainstream view.  Even religious parents, the vast majority of them, say they want their children not to go to a religious school but to go to a diverse and inclusive school.

            "text": "That doesn't reassure me at all because this is the first discriminatory faith school on this scale to open in over a decade.  We know that once schools do open, they tend to continue to discriminate and things tend to get worse over time.  They open with promises of inclusion.  Councils promise to review the policies.  The reality is that councils often don't have the power to do so once the school is in religious hands.  Although it's 100% state-funded in its ongoing costs by taxpayers and by central government, government has relatively little control, and the power of many religious lobbies within our education system means that that's unlikely to change.  So I don't believe the council, even if it wanted to, would be able to fulfil those sorts of commitments. ",
