What's wrong?  My God!  That's my handkerchief!  Uh-huh.  Oh, boy.  You look crap.  At North Shore Recovery High School, we work with some of the most vulnerable children, I believe, in America.  Students who are most likely to succumb to the opioid crisis.  We're not going to mimic what happens in traditional education because we already know that that didn't work for the population of students that we're working with.  Most high schools don't have a relapse policy and mandatory drug testing in their code of conduct.  Fellas, where are you supposed to be?  Juan, where are you supposed to be?  The environment of adolescent addiction, it's so unpredictable.  In a typical day, it could be the most disparaging news you've ever heard in your life.  And then, pure freaking joy, man. ",
