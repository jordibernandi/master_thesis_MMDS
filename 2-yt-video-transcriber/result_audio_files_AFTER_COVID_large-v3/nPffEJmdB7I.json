You compress air inside a plastic bottle, pop open the top and see the result.  Water vapour.  This is what is happening when the jet engines are in cruise mode.  They are running purely on compressed air and the contrails are water vapor being ejected out from the engines.  While small amounts of fuel are needed to get the jet engine up to speed, when in cruise mode the engines use very little to no fuel whatsoever.  We are being charged huge amounts for fuel that doesn't exist. ",

Now this information is so easy to find online, it's absolutely mind-blowing that there are people who think like this dingbat.  because I found an example online and I'm going to read the example to you.  Basically, it states that the average cost of a flight from New York to DC costs $80 and they break that $80 down because anybody who's self-employed will completely understand this.  There's a bit more to it than the average consumer sees.  So it starts off with crew costs, and all this is being taken out of that $80 flight charge for one passenger.  So out of the $80, there's $1.50 in crew costs.  So the pilot, co-pilot, flight attendants, they all want to get paid, yeah?  Airport fees, because aeroplanes can't just land and take off from any airport they choose.  They have to pay for the privilege, and the airport fees are $13.50.  Kind of like a parking fee, if you like, because airports have got operating costs as well, oddly enough.  Miscellaneous taxes and fees, which are $15.60, security fees and other taxes.  Aeroplane costs.  Oddly enough, again, because it's an aeroplane, is $11.50.  And this covers things like the purchase of the plane, which the passengers are paying for out of their own pocket, flight by flight.  And these planes aren't $250 on eBay.  They cost a bit more than that.  Maintenance costs, $14.  Airplanes are far more complicated to maintain than cars.  It's a much more highly skilled job being an aircraft technician than it is being a motor vehicle technician.  non-flying part of the ticket price, which is $10.  And this covers things like how much it actually takes to run an aeroplane company, staffing, again, insurances, buildings.  It all has to be paid for.  Aeroplane insurance.  Even the airlines have to pay an insurance premium.  So if there's any accidents, if anything untoward was to happen, they're insured to cover their liability.  $25 again.  So that gives you a rough grand total of $70.  So on that one ticket, if I was to jump on a plane in New York and pay the $80 to fly to DC, the airline I fly on is actually making about $10 profit.  But I think what this guy is trying to get at and what he's trying to say is that airplanes don't actually run on jet fuel.  They run on compressed air.  I think that's what he's trying to say. ",

What I'm saying is that it's a fraction of what we're being charged for and a minor part of flight technology. ",
