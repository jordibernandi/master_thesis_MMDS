The second auditor caught it, and she said, no, this is Trump.  That's just while I'm standing there.  So does the second checker catch it every time?  But this lady, in three times in three minutes, from 2.09 to 2.12, she got three wrongs.  That's just in the short time that you were... That I was standing there.  And does it get corrected every time?  Because the next table I went to right after that, the only reason I left that table was because there was one where the first person was reading it off, handing it to her.  She's not even looking at it.  She's just putting it in.  Putting it in which set?  Whatever one the first person said.  So table 17 was the first one where the woman got it wrong three times.  Table 18... was where the first person would call out Biden or Trump.  She'd pass it across the table.  The other person did not even look at it and just put it wherever the first person sat.  That person was supposed to be auditing it, checking the second one.  And so here's what happened after that.  So I go and report it.  They say, oh, we'll talk to the election officials, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  They tell her, hey, I guess they talked to her.  And so I come back by again in a few minutes.  She's not doing that after they've talked to her.  So I come and stand next to her, and she goes like this.  Like being all cutesy about it, being exact.  Being snarky.  Yeah, so I keep walking.  I turn around, I look, and she's looking at me walking away as she's getting handed more ballots because she's watching me.  That's when things start getting real shady, like really tense and complex.  because no matter where I was standing in the room, her and a couple other people started, you know, they were looking, they were calling their boss over there pointing at me.  I haven't touched anybody.  I haven't talked to anybody.  I haven't done anything.  All I'm doing is writing down, observing, telling what happened.  So I see they're all talking to her, and they keep pointing over here.  Well, I make another slow lap around the room, and as I come back behind her, she says, I'm paid by the taxpayer, and these fucking assholes want to come in here and watch me. ",
