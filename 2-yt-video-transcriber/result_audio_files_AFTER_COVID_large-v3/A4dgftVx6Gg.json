            "text": "Well, because one of the elders said, what about Jesus?  He was pure, perfect, without sin.  He was the Lamb of God.  And so Jesus walks up to God the Father, who is seated on the throne, takes the sealed book out of His hand.  God the Father gives Him this sealed book.  It's the title deed to the earth, and he's got a brain again, as I've said, the earth under submission, the earth dwellers under submission.  And that is what is going to take place in that time.  And so this title deed to the earth that God has given His Son, And by the way, in that third heaven, which is the view that we have there in chapter 5, there are the four heavenly angelic creatures that are there.  They weren't asked to open the book.  You've got the 24 elders.  They were not asked or given the task of opening the book.  Only God the Father would give that book to Jesus Christ, the one worthy, the only one worthy of opening that book.  For example, here's a wonderful depiction of that scroll with seven seals on it.  He would break the first one, and then the Antichrist would come forth.  Break the second one, a man on a red horse would come forth.  Break the third one and the fourth one.  That fourth one, one-fourth of the earth would be killed.  And then the fifth judgment, which is basically persecution of believers during that tribulation period.  The sixth seal would be broken, and the heavenlies would shout forth, hey, things are beginning to happen.  Judgment is coming.  And the sun would go black, and the moon would go red, that red moon that so many people talk about.  And the earthquakes are going to increase and intensify around the earth.  And then, of course, that seventh seal, chapter 8 and verse 1, That's going to be where there's silence in the heavens for about a space of a half an hour.  I think what the Lord is talking about here, it's going to be so bad.  Even with these beginning sealed judgments, which are not as bad as the next set, trumpet judgments, and the final set, the vial judgments, even at this time there's going to be some bad things happening.  But listen, silence indicates it's getting worse from here, and we'll see that. ",
