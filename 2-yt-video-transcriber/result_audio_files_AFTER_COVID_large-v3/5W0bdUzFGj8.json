In this particular argument, you have no way of separating God from nature or the natural world.  There is just no need for a conscious being to exist for reality to exist.  It can just naturally exist like other things just naturally exist without the supernatural intervention of God.  Well, if you want to know this guy's complete argument and why he's wrong, then please stay tuned.  So, this young man starts out by reading a Reddit post that puts forth the divine hiddenness argument.  Basically, if God does exist, then why don't we have evidence already?  Why doesn't God undeniably prove his existence to us?  Why does God use ambiguous and vague ways in which to reveal himself to us?  These are all great questions to ask that a religious person would have to answer if they were trying to convince you that God exists.  Let's see how this guy answers these questions. ",

The only thing that we differ on is why reality remains consistent and has structure.  You think a conscious being is needed in order to give it those attributes, and I think that reality just has those attributes naturally. ",

Your entire argument in this video relies on God, specifically the Christian version of God, being the only thing that can give this reality structure and consistency.  You just baselessly assert this without establishing why this entity is needed to give structure to reality.  You also failed to distinguish God from just the nature of reality.  You rely on a God of the Gaps argument to establish that God is needed.  Then, you provided a false dichotomy where you baselessly assert that it can only ever be one God.  You then anthropomorphize reality in order to make it seem like we need a being to govern reality.  And finally, yes, I have considered all of these arguments.  And yes, I still remain unconvinced by these shitty arguments that require fallacious reasoning in order to support their conclusions.  Thank you, heathens, for joining me today.  I hope that you guys will go down below, let me know what you think about his argument for God's existence.  Do you think that he's on the right track, or do you agree with me and think that this entire argument does not support his conclusion?  Hey, while you're down there, why don't you smash that like button and subscribe if you want more content like this.  Don't forget to stand up and use your voice.  Bye, heathens! ",
