            "text": "Ms.  Thomas-Greenfield, congratulations.  Welcome.  I for a long time believed that the single greatest geopolitical threat facing the United States is China and the communist government in China is a profoundly malign influence.  I am also growing increasingly concerned over the last two weeks by a pattern among Biden administration nominees.  of consistently moving towards and embracing the Chinese Communist Party.  That pattern became even worse this morning in an article that broke in the Washington Post that described a speech you gave just a little over a year ago in October of 2019 to a Confucius Institute.  Confucius Institutes are paid for by the Chinese Communist government.  We have had repeated problems of espionage and propaganda.  That's why the Chinese Communist government funds Confucius Institutes.  Congress has passed bipartisan legislation cracking down on Confucius Institutes, legislation I authored that passed Congress with overwhelming bipartisan support.  At the same time that the United States Congress and the United States government is acting to combat the spying, the espionage, the propaganda coming from Confucius Institutes, run and controlled by the Chinese Communist government, according to the Washington Post, you were apparently going to a Confucius Institute, giving a paid speech, and praising China.  How do you reconcile those two? ",

            "text": "Senator, thank you for asking that question again, and I have addressed some of these issues earlier on in this hearing.  I went to Savannah State University at the request of Savannah State, a historical black college that I have had a long-term relationship with, to give a speech on Africa and US and China policy toward Africa.  I got a $1,500 honorarium from the university for spending several days engaging with their students, talking to their students about careers in the Foreign Service, talking about issues related to Africa.  I expressed to this committee early on my strong and, frankly, unacceptable what I saw in terms of what the Confucius Institute was doing in Georgia.  I saw them engaging in poor black communities with the poorest of people.  It is the same thing that I've seen in Africa, and I was appalled by it.  and I've expressed my strong regret for having given that particular speech at Savannah University, and if I had it to do all over again, I would not have accepted.  I have spoken about China for 35 years of my career working across the continent.  In 2005, I raised the concern about the Chinese sending back North Korean defectors to certain death.  I have raised concerns about how the Chinese engage in Africa and how their malign influences and their efforts have undermined the prosperity of the African people.  And I see what they're doing at the United Nations as undermining our values, undermining what we believe in, They're undermining our security.  They're undermining our people.  And we need to work against that.  So I appreciate you raising that for me again.  And I want to say in no uncertain terms that I look forward to working with this body to address these issues.  You've taken some incredible steps such as and seeing some of the reports that this body has taken related to China.  And I support all of those steps.  and I will be working aggressively against Chinese malign efforts in New York. ",
