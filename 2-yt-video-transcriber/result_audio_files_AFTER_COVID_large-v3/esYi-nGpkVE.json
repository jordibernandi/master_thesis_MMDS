But as I saw the different reactions, and if you actually took time, most people would advise you to not go online and see all these different reactions.  But if you did that, it just kind of hit me, man.  Like if things are like this, and this is how things end, how quickly would people jump on the side of somebody who just automatically showed up and could solve it like that?  Or all you had to do is just worship this, or all you had to do is just receive this cure.  And it just got me like, wow.  Yeah.  Things can change in a heartbeat.  Yeah.  You know, and then you mentioned that idea of get our attention.  And then I was listening to a podcast the other weekend and they use this words that just, I just love the way they phrase it.

And I really think that's an opportunity that we have now as smaller communities and really discuss these questions and really kind of flesh out those personal experiences as to how this works with the goal, obviously, of... You know, submitting to the word, you know, what role do we have to play in their lives?  or what role do we have to shine a light in this just kind of time when people kind of see it as just nothing but darkness?  Yeah.  Well, thank you for your word.  We're going to see how this pans out.  I think the other part that you kind of touched on that really is.  we've probably seen people maybe for the first time express panic, really.  And I think that really can have an effect too.  It reminded me of reading a series of books that I got from my son.  And I just thought it was really well, the story's been told.  I can't finish the story because I haven't finished the book yet.  But I'm getting there.  But it was just, they were in a situation and they were given the advice from this godlike figure who said, you know, just it's careful, be careful what lens you view the world through.  And so it's a kid's story, and so they get in this situation, and in the first level of the challenge that they're in, they find these glasses, and they have the gold rim, and it allows them to see things clearly.  They don't see the size of the monster or the danger that they're in.  And so they pass that one, and they get into the next level, and they try to apply the same thing, but they pull up a different lens.  They pull up these glasses that have these black frames, and all of a sudden, everything just becomes magnified.  Now the danger looks so much bigger and things like that.

How do you talk about whether something is a fact or a fiction, or whether it's a reality or a fantasy, or whether it's right or wrong?  You go on the Internet and you'll find arguments about everything that you can think of with people taking various sides of the argument claiming that they have the only true representation of that issue.  And what's led to is that we begin to have exaggerated fears to the point of hysteria and paranoia.  I mean, think about it for a moment.  Why would people fill shopping carts full of toilet paper?  because somehow in their mind they think that the supply chain is going to be cut off.  And all the experts saying, all you're doing is creating a false shortage, because they don't produce that much toilet paper, because generally people don't use that much toilet paper.  And I see a big dip afterwards when... People get over this few weeks of this pandemic and they have all this toilet paper.  Then they're going to have to readjust their production because so many people really don't need that much toilet paper.  it's kind of being blown so far out of proportion.  But what also it does, it tends to reinforce our biases even to the point of bigotry.  We begin to see people as singular entities, and we see them as being either good or evil, right or wrong, falsehood or liar.  We begin to categorize people into these ways.  that destroys human relationship.  And at some point, we begin to waver between apathy and panic so that the push and pull of all of this begins to drive people so crazy that what happens is our view of reality actually becomes distorted.  I don't want to cast stones, but I feel like the way that so many people are responding, one physician put it really well.  He said, the problem isn't just the pandemic, it's the panic-demic that's coming as a result.  And I think it's a true observation.  Well, the lack of clarity creates this confusion.  And so I think that that's what we all struggle with.  There's just so many things that aren't clear.  What exactly does it mean?  And it leads to erratic behaviors.  If everybody's rushing to buy toilet paper, what's my conclusion?  Toilet paper must be critical.  And so people like Lemmings chase after the toilet paper and rarely, like you say, they're reacting, they're not stepping back and going, okay, what's the deeper lesson here?  But I find that for people who are just living for their place in this world, anything that threatens that progress is the enemy that needs to be destroyed.  And that's where you end up with this very predatorial, vicious culture that tramples people under its feet in order to save its own.  So it's scary times. ",
