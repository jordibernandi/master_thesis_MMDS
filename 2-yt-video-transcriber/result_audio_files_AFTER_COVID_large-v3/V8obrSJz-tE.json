Welcome to this education.  welcome to another sjw episode.  and as always on these episodes if you cringe you win because you know that none of this behavior none of this stuff none of this from the media.  this is our media.  this is the media that is informing the public.  none of this helps anything.  it doesn't help anyone.  it actually causes a further divide.  that's all it does.  so if you cringe you win.  Also see these episodes as more of a history, a detailing of what is happening today.  So if you are watching this years from now, hopefully years from now if this channel is still around, this is really happening.  This is the world we live in.  This 1984-style censorship, this shaming into censoring, this left-wing fascism, this social justice fascism. ",

You know what disgusts me even more so than this?  How come we haven't had cries of this over french fries, over pizza, over sushi, okay?  That's what disgusts me more than anything.  Now we're just diving into cultural appropriation with jerk chicken?  This should have happened a long time ago.  The greatest black man to ever live.  I just want to fact check that.  That's not true.  But I also want to point out the fact that you're paying homage to old George Floyd here.  And you have the biggest piece of crap shirt ever.  Look at this.  You got holes in the thing.  That's what you think about old George?  If you think that much about him, that you're going to put him on this piece of crap t-shirt.  Disgusting.  This was my 8th graders homework assignment tonight.  Uniting for Black Lives.  What does the phrase, I can't breathe, reference?  Well, if we're looking at the case objectively, he was saying this before the cops even touched him.  So the phrase, I can't breathe, is likely referencing the three to four times the lethal amount of fentanyl in his blood, among other drugs.  That's what I can't breathe is referencing.  And again, 99.9% of us agree that we probably shouldn't be putting knees on necks as cops, but the chances of that being the thing that actually killed him are very, very low.  And that's not what I can't breathe is referencing.  It's the fluid in his lungs, the three to four times amount of the fentanyl.  So I hope that's what your kid put on the homework.  More importantly here, this is what is being taught in our schools... Kind of disgusting.  Gender studies professor.  Time is racist.  It is.  It's racist.  Every morning I grab an iced coffee and I talk to the president.  You didn't fucking lose because of voter fraud.  You lost because of black women, Latinx women, indigenous women.  They all did voter drives.  They got millions of people that never cared about politics in their entire fucking life to come out and fucking vote against you.  You lost because you're a white supremacist piece of shit.  And you're protecting a white supremacist piece of shit right now.  Lose like a fucking adult, not a fucking baby.  I never thought I'd be drinking iced coffee after last week, but I'm still drinking iced coffee.  110% completely normal behavior.  That's just amazing stuff there.  Amazing stuff, really. ",
