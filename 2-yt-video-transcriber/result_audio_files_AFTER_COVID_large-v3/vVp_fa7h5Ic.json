Look at me, the center of attention.  Black Messiah coming with a business.  Coming with a business.  Black Messiah coming with a business.  They scream at peace, there ain't no peace.  We prophesied in the streets, we seekin' peace in the streets of Babylon.  Brandis and Glock Ford is tuckin' heat like a carry-on.  Sittin' against the fathers, gotta sleep, you're not nappin' on.
