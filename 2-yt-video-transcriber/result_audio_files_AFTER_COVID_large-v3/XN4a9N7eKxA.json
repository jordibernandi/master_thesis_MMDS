I asked you for some fucking medical information!  I'm terribly sorry, ladies and gentlemen, we seem to have accidentally invited someone from the World Hope Organization!  Shut up!  From the World Hope Organization!  The world, oh fuck, I hope this isn't really happening, organization.  You're a doctor, for fuck's sake.  Treatment, damage reduction, drugs, anything.  Throw me a fucking bone here. ",
