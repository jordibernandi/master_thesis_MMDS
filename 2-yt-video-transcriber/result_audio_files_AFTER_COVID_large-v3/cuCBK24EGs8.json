            "text": "Hello, everyone.  Happy Tuesday.  I love you.  Sending you a massively huge virtual hug wherever you are on the earth plane.  in this powerful now moment.  So wow, this is what it looks like to shift an entire human collective.  It's quite a magical and miraculous show right now.  I want to jump on and, you know, to be completely honest, I feel like a lot of my messages right now are reiterating the same thing.  But the reason I feel like it's so important to reiterate this message is I need it And if I need it, I'm sure many of you need it, which is this reminder that this is exactly what it's designed to look like.  Ascension.  You know, if you've been in this community for a while, you've had this idea of like new earth, 5D consciousness.  Oh my God, this is going to be so great.  Here we go.  And if you are not in that community and just sort of navigating this, you're like, what the hell are we going through?  What is this?  Why are we doing this?  What's happening here?  However you are seeing these now moments, this is what it looks like.  When an entire human collective, which is an energetic consciousness, it's energy, it's vibrating, it's holding a frequency.  When it is being pulled, into higher frequencies or higher states of consciousness, not only can your body feel it, not only can the planet feel it, but the entire human collective and the systems that have been in place can feel it.  And it is pulling us out of the comfortable.  It's pulling us out of what we are used to.  It's pulling us into something that may feel a little bit more uncomfortable, unsure of, how do I know?  What if this isn't gonna work out, right?  All of these questions that many of us may have and many of us may not have.  But there isn't anything necessarily comfortable around an entire human collective shifting.  but it is very safe to shift with the human collective.  What I want to talk about right now is the feelings and the emotions, the behaviors, the beliefs around it right now.  It's getting very loud out there.  It's getting very, like it's getting worse almost, right?  Quote unquote.  worse, perhaps for some of us, depends on how you look at it.  So this is where we start to focus on coming back to ourselves.  There's a lot of fear.  Let's pay attention.  Let's just talk about the consciousnesses that are really coming up right now.  A lot of censorship, a lot of censorship.  And when censorship gets louder, it's a fear and a control.  So those that are censoring are afraid of losing control.  They don't want information getting out, whether it is for the highest good or for the worst for humanity.  We have never seen censorship the way it is right now.  There's a reason for that.  We are being asked to look at fear, control, and manipulation.  And one of the first places we can look is censorship.  Wow, we're censored.  Look at how much louder censorship is.  It's manipulation, it's fear, and it's control.  There's a lot more control coming down on the human collective right now.  Why?  Because control is what we are stepping out of and collapsing.  It's gonna get louder.  Manipulation.  Crap ton of manipulation right now.  We don't know what to believe, right?  What do I believe?  What's true?  What's not true?  That's called manipulation, meaning We are being shown that we have been lied to or coerced or programmed for a very long time.  And when you start to step out of that control, you're like, holy SHIT, what do I believe now?  How do I know anything's true, right?  There's a confusion.  Fear is off the charts right now.  Why?  Because it's the largest consciousness that we're shifting.  This isn't to say that this is comfortable, easy, and fun to go through, but it is to say that this is exactly how we go into a 5D field or a 5D consciousness, which is inevitably exactly what we're doing because it is the design that Earth intended millions of years ago.  There is nothing stopping where we are going and what we're going through.  So everything that we are navigating right now is perfect, which I keep saying, but it doesn't necessarily mean that it's easy.  So as you are watching people belittling and name calling and throwing people under the bus, right?  As you are watching large, media moguls or internet companies or social media companies censoring in a way they never have before as you are watching a political system literally dismantle in front of your face.  As you're watching all of these things happen, it's not bad.  It's not good.  It's the evolution of consciousness.  So pay attention with that lens.  When you're looking out at the external, you can see it through the third dimensional human lens, which is, Oh my God, how are we going to get through this?  This is insane.  Am I safe?  Am I okay?  Am I free?  Do I have choice?  Right?  That's the human aspect.  The higher dimensional aspect that you are knows that this is perfect and divine and that you are safe and that you are free and that you do have choice and a voice.  And when you engage with others that are also navigating this huge evolution in consciousness, and they might not see it the same way you do, pay attention to how you are connecting with them, responding to them, reacting to them.  Pay attention to the consciousnesses that they are holding.  Pay attention to the consciousnesses that you are holding.  And always, always, always, if this resonates, practice coming back here.  We are learning sovereignty in a playing field that requires it in order to be able to move through your nows.  And sovereignty is, I'm safe, I'm free, I am light, I'm frequency.  I am safe to speak.  I am safe to be.  I am whole.  I am complete.  I am embodied.  I am right here, right now.  Over and over and over again.  I am light.  I am safe.  I am free.  I am light.  Whatever you need to say.  And when you find yourself getting caught up into fear or manipulation control all these consciousnesses that are being thrown at you.  Great.  Go ahead and get caught up if you need to or feel whatever you're feeling.  But then wait a second.  Let me come back home.  I've talked about this before because it is so important right now.  Otherwise you will get caught up in the hamster wheel of the external that we are shifting.  You will get caught up in it.  We want to be the eye of the storm.  Remember the eye of the storm.  We're in the storm.  It's going.  And it's gonna look like a movie that you have never seen before.  That you can't push pause on.  You can't exit out of the movie theater.  You're in.  By the way, you chose to be here.  Don't forget, you incarnated to be here at this time, the most magical time.  You know, I did a guided journey a couple of days ago on my Patreon community and Prince came through and he said, you guys, this is a gift.  This is a gift.  Devour it.  Devour every now moment in everything you're experiencing.  But he says, I promise you, if you were to exit out of your body right now and become and move back into that higher dimensional consciousness that you are, you would regret it.  You would want to be right back in at the biggest show consciousness has ever seen.  It's the most miraculous, greatest show consciousness has ever seen and experienced.  This isn't about politics, it's not about vaccines, it's not about right and wrong, it's not about these things that we're seeing physically in the external.  It is and it isn't.  It is in the sense that we're standing in this, we're physically seeing that stuff, but it is all about a massive energetic shift And so what we are battling is energy.  It's an energetic pull of lower consciousness or darkness, whatever you want to call it.  Darkness is only consciousness that is in a lower frequency that hasn't shifted into more light.  So it moves out of the shadow.  The battle that we're in right now is energetic.  It's consciousness pulling dark into light.  literally dragging dark into light.  So of course, what are we going to see?  The only way you drag darkness into light is grabbing the darkness.  And there are many humans that are playing out darkness.  Are you getting caught up in it?  Or are you staying in your sovereign field?  Are you perpetuating this consciousness that we're pulling?  Or are you staying in your sovereignty and your light, pulling it?  We pull it by staying in our light and by watching it staying in our light, not reacting, not responding in a frequency that's similar to that which we are pulling.  but in compassion and empathy and love, unity.  It's happening.  We're going to go kicking and screaming, and we're going to go jumping and hollering and hopping and skipping.  We got this.  It's beautiful and quite shocking how we're going through this.  Come back to you.  Everything that's happening out there is the consciousness we're shifting.  And pay attention to it.  Pay attention to what is getting louder.  Who is getting louder.  And you'll be able to navigate this a lot easier.  It's the greatest, greatest show.  And it's the most courageous, courageous moment that you could be in.  So be gentle with yourself.  Be compassionate with yourself and all the other humans that are navigating this.  I love you.  Thank you for being here. ",
