            "text": "Happy holidays, everyone.  I wanted to take a moment to send my warmest wishes to everyone celebrating Kwanzaa.  Like so many other holidays, we will be celebrating Kwanzaa a little differently this season in our home.  We'll be doing it over Zoom.  You know, my sister and I, we grew up celebrating Kwanzaa.  Every year, our family and our extended family, we would gather around across multiple generations, and we'd tell stories.  The kids would sit on the carpet, and the elders would sit in chairs, and we would light the candles and, of course, afterwards have a beautiful meal.  And, of course, there was always the discussion of the seven principles.  And my favorite, I have to tell you, was always the one about self-determination, Kujichagulia.  And, you know, essentially it's about, you know, it's about be.  Be and do.  Be the person you want to be and do the things you want to do and do the things that need to be done.  It's about not letting anyone write our future for us, but instead going out and writing it for ourselves.  And that principle motivates me today as we seek to confront the challenges facing our country and to build a brighter future for all Americans.  So to everyone who is celebrating, happy Kwanzaa from our family to yours. ",
