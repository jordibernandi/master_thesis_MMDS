Like, what if we bring all of our friends together, sing about the quarantine, and just have a good old time, as best as we can have right now?  Man, I am in.  I am ready.  Let me FaceTime Micah.  All right, call Micah.  Let's get it together.  Let's go.  All right.  went to the grocery store after the stampede. ",

Quarantine, quarantine, drinking whiskey like vaccine Waving at the neighbors, social distancing.  Quarantine, quarantine, wearing Lysol like sunscreen.  Quarantine, quarantine, oh lonesome quarantine.  All my anti-hunting buds are reaching out to me.  I know your freezer stays stocked up, can I get some fresh deer meat?  Well I hope your family's well, hope them hands are clean.  Any chance that you might have an extra AR-15.  Quarantine, quarantine, drinking whiskey like vaccine Waving at the neighbors.  Social distancing.  Quarantine, quarantine.  Wearing lights all like sunscreen.  Quarantine, quarantine.  Oh, lonesome quarantine.  Thank you.  Shout out to the heroes fighting this disease.  It's time to come together now.  There's one society.  Wait a minute. ",

Have a great day and let's all stay together and support the people that are taking care of us.  Cheers. ",
