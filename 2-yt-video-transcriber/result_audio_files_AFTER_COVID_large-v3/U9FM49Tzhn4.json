            "text": "Now, we're going to do something we haven't done in a while.  So over the last week or so, there's been a lot of attention paid to a music video.  It's called WAP.  okay, which we're going to get into in just one second.  And it seems to me that there's a segment that we have been remiss in ignoring for a long time now on the show.  We used to do it much more regularly.  It's called deconstructing the culture.  So it is time once again to deconstruct the culture where we take an important piece of popular culture and we break it down for its important aspect in American life.  So let's deconstruct a little bit of culture.  So there's this video that went out.  It is by a person named Cardi B who has a rather checkered past.  I mean, she's talked on video about how she used to drug men and steal their money after bringing them back as what, a quasi prostitute, something like that.  And then she became a rapper.  So American success story.  And there's another rapper whose name is Megan Thee Stallion.  I assume this is her given name.  Their last name is Stallion and her parents named her Megan Thee.  And I don't know why her middle name is Thee as opposed to Thee.  But apparently you are the stallion, not just the, the, the art of the stallion.  In any case, there's this new video.  And just as a preface to this video, let me note some of the headlines about this video from mainstream outlets.  The headline from Complex was, why Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion's empowering anthem, WAP, is so important.  It's very important, guys.  It's a very, very empowering, important anthem.  Grammy, Grammy.com, they put out a, like, people who do the Grammy Awards, they put out a headline, Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion deliver a juicy collaboration with WAP.  Wow.  I mean, it must be important.  Metro UK put out a headline, the backlash to Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion's WAP proves society still hates sexually powerful women.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Apparently, according to Billboard, Christina Aguilera is feeling some type of way about Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion's WAP.  This is a deeply important piece of art, guys.  And then Black Entertainment TV, BET, they put out a headline, Cardi B perfectly claps back at misogynistic criticism of WAP.  Because all criticism of WAP is misogynistic.  Like deeply misogynistic and sexist, as it turns out.  And this video, this music video, had 56 million views.  within 48 hours of release because it got all sorts of press, and it was deeply important.  This is a deeply important piece of American art that we should all pay attention to.  It is deeply empowering.  So we're going to play a little bit of the video, and then I'm going to read you some of the lyrics to WAP, which stands for a thing.  I can't say most of the words in this song.  I mean, I can pronounce them, but if I say them aloud, then we will be banned by the FCC.  So here is a little bit of this video.  So, as you can see, there's water pouring out from the front of a mansion.  Okay, here are these two ladies, and then there is just a giant golden butt.  Okay, and then there's golden boobs that apparently are spouting water.  Um... It's, um... Yeah, so this is all great.  And then there's some tigers, and... This is apparently the tackiest mansion that it's ever been.  And, um... And then there's them lying there with a bunch of snakes.  You know, kind of typical music video kind of stuff.  But it's very empowering.  This is deeply, deeply empowering stuff.  So if you can't hear the lyrics, because I don't know why you would hear the lyrics, frankly.  Here are some of the lyrics.  This is empowering stuff, guys.  This is like Susan B. Anthony.  This is like women fighting for the right to vote.  This right here is women fighting for the right to work.  Right here, what we are watching is women fighting for the equal right to talk about their wet ass P word.  That's what WAP stands for.  So here are the actual lyrics.  OK, and this is not demeaning to women in any way.  It's not demeaning to women in any way.  It doesn't turn women into sex objects.  It doesn't make men think of women in a in a purely sexual fashion.  It is women empowering themselves.  It is super empowerment.  Here's some of the lyrics.  You ready?  Whores in this house.  There's some whores in this house.  There's some whores in this house.  There's some whores in this house.  Hold up.  I said certified freak seven days a week.  Wet ass P word.  Make that pullout game week.  Yeah, you effing with some wet ass P word.  P word is female genitalia.  Bring a bucket and a mop for this wet ass P word.  Give me everything you got for this wet ass P word.  Beat it up, N-word.  Catch a charge.  Extra large and extra hard.  Put this P-word right in your face.  Swipe your nose like a credit card.  Hop on top.  I want a ride.  I do a kegel while it's inside.  Spit in my mouth.  Look in my eyes.  This P-word is wet.  Come take a dive.  It continues along these lines.  And it gets significantly, significantly more vulgar, like a lot more vulgar.  Talk your S word, bite your lip, ask for a call while you ride that D word.  You really ain't never going to F him for a thing.  He already made his mind up before he came.  And now get your boots and your coat for this wet ass P word.  Pay my tuition just to kiss me on this wet ass.  Right.  So this is deep, guys.  This is what feminists fought for.  This is what the feminist movement was all about.  It's not really about women being treated as independent, full, rounded human beings.  It's about wet-ass P-word.  And if you say anything differently, it's because you're a misogynist, you see.  It gets really, really, really, really, really vulgar.  But I will admit that when I first saw the lyrics to this song, my first concern as a sympathetic and empathetic human being, my first concern was, is that these women are describing a serious gynecological condition.  And, like, I'm serious.  These women are suffering from some sort of serious, I mean, a bucket and a mop?  This sounds like there's something that is going on here that is not biologically normal.  And, by the way, this song is so unsexy that it frankly sounds like somebody describing what amounts to a serious condition that requires the care of a doctor.  So, fortunately, I know a doctor who is my wife.  And so I asked her for her medical diagnosis.  And she looked at the lyrics herself.  And after being kind of appalled by them, obviously, she had a few sort of indicators here on how she could diagnose the vaginal condition that apparently these women are suffering from.  So there are a few sort of giveaways.  There are a few sort of giveaways here.  So first of all, a bucket and a mop for this wet ass P word.  So first of all, she had to clarify whether wet ass P word was a description of the P word or whether one of the clinical symptoms here was also diarrhea.  But... Bring a bucket and a mop.  So this suggests that there's an awful lot of not to be too graphic, but some sort of medical discharge.  that's happening here, like a lot too much and a lot too much, because that's a symptom of something that is not going great.  Apparently, there are signs of prolapse.  And I say that because hop on top.  I want to ride.  I do a kegel while it's inside.  So there's some signs of some actual clinical prolapse, which is which is a problem.  Also, there's some talk about where this person is putting their nose.  And there's some talk about smelling, right?  There's a line here about gagging and choking, which suggests that perhaps there's an odor issue here.  Also, at some point in here, there's a reference to diabetes about about a person who engages in particular activity and ends up diabetic, which suggests a serious pH imbalance.  So I asked my wife for a differential diagnosis for the sake of these ladies in case they need to go to the doctor.  I mean, like this is a problem.  I mean, like if if this is like there's water pouring out the front doors of this place, that ain't water, guys.  I mean, that's that's what I'm being told.  That ain't water.  So the medical diagnosis, here was her differential.  Her differential diagnosis, my wife, the doctor, was either these women are suffering from bacterial vaginosis or a yeast infection, or my wife suggested most probably they are suffering from trichomonas.  So just a bit of medical advice.  Put aside the empowerment.  I mean, I understand how empowering it is for women to sing about the moisture state of their genitals.  And I understand that anybody who criticizes this as reductive of female sexuality and or of putting out images of females as over sexualized in a way that is negative, that puts negative images in men and drives negative images toward women for men, treating them as sex objects.  I understand that that stuff is out of bounds.  Right.  I mean, if we mention any of that stuff, it's because we're misogynist.  I'm a sexist for saying that women are more than just, you know, they're wet ass P words.  But.  As a sympathetic human being, I just want to make sure these ladies get the care they need.  My wife's medical advice is that they go to a gynecologist ASAP and that they do whatever checks are necessary for bacterial vaginosis, yeast infection, or trichomonas. ",
