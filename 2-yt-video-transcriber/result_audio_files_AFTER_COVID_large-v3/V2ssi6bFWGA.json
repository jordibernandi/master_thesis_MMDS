            "text": "Hey, yo, what it do, YouTube?  Y'all know who it is, Drop Don.  Hey, I wasn't going to do a video tonight, to be honest, man, because as you see, the internet is all over the place with this situation.  But I did want to address a couple of things since I had a little bit of free time.  First of all, I'm going to address a couple of black people, and this is what makes this shit so unique, right?  I've been having black people email me talking about, how do you feel about your boy?  We told you he was an FBI agent.  We told you he was working for them.  I mean, in my response to that, man, if y'all ain't the most ridiculous motherfuckers I've ever seen or heard of in my life.  I mean, to the point I really wasn't going to address it.  But just for the simple fact, man, it seemed like when it comes to situations like this, it'd be black people.  That tear us down.  I mean, at the end of the day, man, if you ain't got nothing really positive to say, how about just not say nothing at all?  You ain't got to email me.  You ain't got to waste your time out your day to hit me up and tell me how you feel about the situation.  You're entitled to your own opinion, Scooby.  Ain't nobody holding you back for you feeling the way you want to feel.  I mean, so you and it's just not him.  I've been getting a lot of emails because at the end of the day, people know I put up these videos.  I push these videos.  So I expect the feedback.  I have no problem with it, but I will address them.  I mean, I have no problem doing that either.  So at the end of the day, you keep sending them and I might make a video about you one day.  You never know.  But it ain't no real big deal.  But what I did want to address, man, is everybody want to know why is Jay locked up?  You see this picture that's been floating around.  This is the incident, evidently, that everybody, this is what they talking about.  Evidently, it was, they had, like, police had some snipers on the roof.  You know, they had their little shit taped up, too.  They had people on the roof.  Evidently, Jay and his people spotted some people on the roof.  Jay shoots the gun, not even shoots the gun, but he aims the gun up there because it got a flashlight on it.  He aims the gun towards the roof, and lo and behold, whoever cop was up there, the two cops that was up there, they didn't know he had a gun because the light blinded them.  But do you see how ridiculous this story?  This story sounds crazy as hell.  Because at the end of the day, man, if that was the case, why not grab that man that day?  Why not get that man that day?  How y'all going to wait damn near two damn months to come scoop this man?  And then you talking about if that's the case, you're telling me he waited that long to press charges or he waited that long to even bring it up?  And this is what killed me with these situations, man.  I mean, ain't nobody stupid.  I mean, but if y'all talking about this situation, I mean, of course, they was going to have people on the roof.  But at the end of the day, he didn't know who was up there.  So when he pointed, just for the simple fact it was a light attached to it, when he pointed it up there to see what was up there, he found out it was them.  He didn't feel nothing about it because he never addressed the situation.  But at the end of the day, I guess dude felt it was a threat.  I mean, but come on, man.  I mean, with a good lawyer, I feel like anybody could beat that because they just grasping at anything right now.  It's like you grasping at air because that makes no sense.  I mean, if my flashlight is attached to my gun, if I'm trying to find out what's up there, when I aim the flashlight up there, guess what?  The gun is going with it.  So at the end of the day, you can't sit and try to buffoon people and try to make them believe what you want us to believe.  So at the end of the day, Scooby going to be free soon.  I mean, free that man.  That man ain't did nothing wrong.  Free that man.  That's going to be my hashtag from now on for the ones that want to know, man.  Free that man.  Until that man come home, free that man.  In my eyes, that dude ain't did nothing wrong.  And I understand the haters because, yo, he been had haters before he got locked up.  But, boy, these dudes is excited about the situation now.  Man, I'm seeing people doing videos that wasn't even doing YouTube videos.  This is their first.  I go look at their channel.  This is their first video ever.  Grandmaster J goes to jail.  Come on, school.  Like, if you ain't going to promote nothing negative, how dare your first video?  And then you black.  How dare you being black?  Your first video you put up talking about NFAC leader goes to come on.  Scooby, this is what's wrong with us now.  I mean, this is what's fucked up with us now.  This is why I sit on this YouTube shit and talk and talk my shit and y'all listen sometime and then sometime you don't.  Because at the end of the day, man, we got to do better than what we doing.  We got to do better.  And I'm not sitting on the end of this shit talking like I'm perfect because I'm far from perfect, man.  But when it comes to certain shit, you got to know right from wrong.  You got to know right from wrong.  Ain't nobody stupid.  I mean, come on, man.  They trying to push this agenda like this man is a terrorist out here.  This man ain't did nothing wrong.  Why y'all hate so much as he speak proudly?  I mean, you don't have a strong following.  And then watch the people that try to build up off this just because they feel this man don't went down.  Watch how many strong leaders that try to pop up out of the blue now with this.  It's not even your movement at all, man.  Y'all been quiet as duck grease every second.  From the beginning of time.  But now you're going to try to make a stand.  Or try to stand for something.  Most of y'all motherfuckers is fluky.  And I be trying to be humble about the situation man.  But most of y'all motherfuckers is fluky.  A lot of y'all YouTube people and shit.  That be putting up these videos.  Y'all people is fluky.  I mean it's like y'all opportunities.  Like y'all wait for certain opportunities.  To pop up on the scene.  If it ain't nothing to talk about.  There's something always to talk about.  When it comes to black people struggling.  So you should have been putting up these videos.  A long time ago school.  Don't wait until now.  You feel us to come up now because him going to jail is trending.  So you feel you want to put up a video and get on this bandwagon?  Yo, that shit is whack.  But who am I to judge?  I'm not judging, man.  But I'm just saying if you're going to stand for something, stand for something year-round.  Don't do it seasonally.  Because, bro, you look like one of them seasoned bros.  Like, come on, man.  Your very only video is talking down about this dude that you know absolutely nothing about.  Absolutely nothing about.  I mean, outside of us fighting everybody else, man, we got to fight in-house too.  And that's what makes this shit sick.  You'll never go nowhere when we can't get along in-house.  Bro, we tag the other day on day in and day out.  And we do that shit for fun, for like a sport.  I mean, at the end of the day, man, that dude going to jail, no matter how y'all feel about the situation, is sad.  I mean, you can make videos and feel good about that shit now until you go to jail and do 30 days in a box.  And I guess your whole attitude would change then.  But most of y'all ain't even that.  Never have been through the struggle enough to know, man.  Don't nobody need to go to jail.  So you putting up these videos good for him.  That's where he need to be.  Nah, man, how dare you?  I don't know who birthed half y'all motherfuckers, man, because I dare you.  Let that man be free, yo.  That man ain't did nothing to nobody.  Let that man be free.  Y'all casting this dude to prison for something.  I mean, y'all ridiculous, yo.  I mean, and not all of y'all, because I understand that people that rock with me on this channel see y'all got a brain.  Y'all know better.  But for the people that thumb down videos and shit all the time, man, y'all need a life, B. Y'all need a life, man.  I don't care nothing about the emails.  Continue to send me these little twisted-ass emails I care nothing about because I still stand for what I stand for.  Y'all blow me with them emails.  That's what you can do.  But at the end of the day, man, I'm still going to push this shit.  I don't care who like it or who don't.  I'm still going to push NFSC all day.  My hashtag is FreeThatManSteel.  Free that man.  That man ain't did nothing wrong, yo.  I mean, free that man.  Y'all got other people, your nephews and cousins and shit walking around here after they done killed somebody.  But y'all won't make no videos about that motherfucker, none.  But y'all will make a video about this dude when he ain't doing nothing but trying to better your black ass community, B. Free that man.  And I'm going to keep saying it.  Free that man.  I mean, if y'all can make it out there on that man court, by the time I come up with the information on his court date and all that, Whenever his court date is, they say he have no bond.  But whenever his court date come up, man, and if y'all in the local area, man, go out there, stand for something.  Support that man.  That man out there supporting y'all when y'all need him.  On that court date, man, go out there and support that man, yo.  It's drop down, man.  And once I get some more information, I'll let y'all know.  Love y'all. ",
