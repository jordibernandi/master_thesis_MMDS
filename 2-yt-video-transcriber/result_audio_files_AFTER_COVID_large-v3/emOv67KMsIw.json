            "text": "Which of these three situations best describes your life?  Number one, you're tied by a needle thread.  You're in the early stages of sin.  You haven't quite got this sin under control.  This sin has got a grip on you, but so far you've only been dabbling.  Number two, that thread has now turned to string.  Okay, now you're addicted.  Now it's not so easy to break the cords of this sin.  You've been toying around with this sin too much.  And now the fact is this, you're entangled.  Or number three, the string has turned to rope.  You now are like a puppet on strings.  And the puppet master is called the devil.  He's been controlling you for years and years.  And you're so bound up by this sin that you think I'll never be able to stop.  This is it for the rest of my life.  I'm bound and I'll never ever change.  So whether you're number one, number two or number three, I want you to know something.  There is no safe amount of sin.  It is impossible to play with sin and not get bound.  Sin will eventually entangle you to the point where you cannot move anymore.  Like a black widow spider, you in a web, sin is waiting to suck the life out of you, to wrap it into its web and keep you there forever and ever.  The Bible puts it like this, it says, his own iniquities entrap the wicked man and he is caught in the cords of his sin.  In a moment's time I'm going to ask you to pause the video and to write the answer to the question I'm going to ask you in the comment box right now.  Over to you now, who was the strongest man who ever lived?  His name was Samson.  Samson was so strong that he killed a lion with his bare hands.  Samson was so strong that he carried the city gates on his back up the top of a mountain.  Samson was so strong that he took on and murdered thousands and thousands of strong Philistine men with just the jawbone of a donkey.  But Samson had a weakness.  As strong as that man was, he had a problem.  And his issue was this.  He could not control his eyes.  It says about Samson, he was spending time with the unbelievers.  And he went down to a place called Timnah.  And he saw a woman.  And he said to his parents, I want you to get that woman for me.  For she is right in my eyes.  But his parents begged him.  They said, please, what about the daughters of Israel?  Why will you not go for one of them?  No, get her for me for she is right in my eyes.  Just like Adam and Eve, they saw that fruit and it was pleasing to the eye and they ate of it and sin entered the world.  So you and I have that same issue.  If you look at pretty much any sin, it often starts with the sin of the eyes.  And for those of you who have read the book of Judges, I wonder if you've noticed that verse which repeats itself over and over again.  You see, the people of Israel follow their leader, Samson.  That's what often happens in society, is we follow our leaders.  And if our leader is a mess, then the society is a mess.  But listen to this.  In those days, there was no king in Israel.  Everyone did what was right.  in his own eyes.  Now, I need you to do something for me.  I need you to write down these next few words because I do believe they will open your eyes.  Sin blinds, sin binds, and sin grinds.  Judges 16 verse 21 says this, and the Philistines seized him, that's Samson, and they gouged out his eyes and brought him down to Gaza and bound him with bronze shackles and he ground at the mill in the prison.  okay firstly sin blinds because samson could not control his eyes because he kept running after chasing after philistine women.  god allowed the philistines to tear out samson's eyes.  he allowed samson to go blind And some of you might be listening to that and thinking, isn't that rather cruel of the Lord?  Well, I plead with you, please stay with me to the end of this video because I'm going to show you something amazing that the Lord did in Samson's life.  And I don't think you'll have seen it before.  Jesus said this, if your right eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away.  For it is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.  Now, I don't believe that Jesus was literally saying that we should tear out our eyes.  But I do think he was saying this.  We need to have a ruthless type of repentance.  We need to take sin that seriously that we say, I want nothing to do with it because I want to live full out for the Lord God.  And between you and me, when I really understood what that verse was saying, I decided I'm not having any internet in my home.  And for five years, I lived like that.  Number two, sin binds.  You know, I believe one of the greatest myths in the Bible is, you know when you've seen in the cartoons those drawings of Samson and you see him and he's built like a truck, he's got huge muscles like Arnold Schwarzenegger or something like that.  I think, I could be wrong, but I think that is totally wrong.  I'll tell you why.  Because if his strength was muscles and sheer brute strength that is humanly speaking, Well, then why is it?  when he was bound in those bronze shackles, he couldn't break free like the other times?  I actually think he was probably a regular-sized guy.  He might even have been a dweeb like me.  And as soon as the Lord removed his strength from Samson, that was it.  He was just like any other man.  He was weak.  Let me let you into another secret.  I believe one of the most terrifying verses in the Bible is where it says Samson stood up But he did not realize the Lord had left him.  The Lord had departed his strength from him.  And I think many of us go our whole lives thinking we can live how we want.  Thinking we have our own strength, our own confidence.  But God will humble us.  He's patient.  He's so patient for such a long time.  but his patience does run out eventually.  And I plead with you all, let's all bear fruit that is bearing with repentance.  And thirdly, sin grinds.  There is a lie and it's come straight out of the pits of hell and it goes like this.  You can disobey God's commands and you'll escape all of the consequences.  My dear brother, my dear sister, never forget this.  If you go against the grain of God's laws, you will get splinters.  Sin will not solve all of your problems.  Sin will not offer relief from the pain you are feeling right now.  There is nothing more costly than your sin.  Your sin will rob you of everything.  Instead of promising you luxury, you will get misery.  Instead of riches, it will give you poverty.  Instead of success, you will get ruined.  Instead of a good reputation, you are tattooed with the name of your chosen passion.  Whether you're a gambler, you'll be called gambler.  Whether you're a drug addict, drug addict, prostitute, adulterer, liar, greedy, all of these things will bear on you for all of your life and you'll be stamped with that name.  My dear friends, I don't mean to sound harsh.  You do know that the man looking at you right now is a dreadful sinner.  And if it weren't for the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ, I have no hope either.  But I want to show you something so beautiful.  I want to give you a hope to cling on, despite the fact that we are all rotten, wicked sinners.  You see, one of the reasons why God allowed all of these dreadful things to happen to his anointed one, to the judge of Israel, Samson, is this.  It made Samson humble.  And right at the end of Samson's life is the first time we hear him praying to the Lord God.  And he says these words, Remember me.  Who else said remember me at the end of his life?  the thief on the cross.  and then just a few moments later after Samson praised the Lord quite humbly he also says this let me die with the Philistines.  so in other words Samson saying I've lived like an unbeliever I've spent time with the unbelievers I've slept with the unbelievers.  I'm nothing more than a Philistine I'm nothing more than an unbeliever And that's all that you would ever think of me, God.  But then, listen to this.  Then his brothers and all his family came down and took him and brought him up and buried him between Zorah and Eshteriel in the tomb of Manoah, his father.  So do you see what happened there?  Samson might have said, I deserve to die with the Philistines.  I deserve to be buried with the unbelievers.  But God says, no, no, no.  You're not being buried with the Philistines.  You're not an unbeliever.  You're one of my children and you're coming back to Israel to be buried alongside my sons and my daughters.  So how does this fit into our lives?  Well, we do fail.  We do make a mess.  But I do believe that God is merciful and we might look at our lives and think I'm nothing more than an unbeliever.  But there is hope because Jesus Christ died for sinners.  The Bible says this, he who commits sin is a slave to sin.  And if we keep going to these sins over and over again, we're nothing more than a slave.  But the Bible also says this, who the Son sets free shall be free indeed.  So know this, if you have put your faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, you can tap into a freedom that no one in the world has apart from the Christian.  Because Jesus is risen from the dead, Sin has no power over you.  The devil has no power over you anymore.  So when that temptation comes into your path, you do know you do not have to yield to it.  The Bible promises us that God will not put a temptation too big that we are not able to overcome.  We are more than conquerors in the Lord Jesus Christ.  And that's why I'm making this video today, that I'm asking every single one of us to live that victorious life.  I've made a mess at times, you've made a mess at times, but we have a Saviour who is merciful, loving and able to keep us from that hour of temptation.  One last thing before you go.  Do you remember at the beginning of the video where I showed you the three different types of people who were bound up in the different cords of sin?  Well, there is one type of cord which is the best of all, and that's the invisible cord, meaning you've never, ever dabbled in that sin.  If that's you and you're watching today, and perhaps as a curiosity, perhaps your friends at school or at college are saying, try this, try that.  I just want to say, don't try it at all, because I guarantee there will be thousands of people in this comment box who would say to you, I wish I never went to that sin.  I wish I never took that drug.  Because once you get into that web, it's very, very hard to get out of it.
