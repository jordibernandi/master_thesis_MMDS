Also, check out the join button for channel memberships.  And check out the merch.  Let's get into this, folks.  We're back to talking about Vanderbilt football.  I put up a video yesterday talking about how the players may actually quit the football team, opt out of the game against the university of Georgia.  And guess what votes it actually happened.  So the Georgia Vanderbilt game will not happen this Saturday.  And of course, you know, the Walt sports media will not actually tell you that players opting out is the reason why this game is canceled.  They're telling you folks that the, This game is canceled because of the virus.  COVID-19, a.k.a.  the Wuhan virus, that is their reasoning behind canceling this game.  Now, ESPN kind of throws you a little bit of a curveball on this.  They actually say Georgia's scheduled game against Vanderbilt on Saturday has been postponed to December 19th because of COVID-19 cases, contact tracing issues, injuries, and opt-outs within the Commodores football program.  So they told you just a little bit about that.  And folks, we know that the virus really does not affect world class athletes whatsoever.  I mean, guys that test positive for the virus, they don't usually get sick.  You know, maybe they have a runny nose.  That's about it.  And they're usually OK within four days.  OK, I mean, 69 year old Nick Saban tested positive for the virus in a couple of days.  He was good to go.  OK, so I'm not buying that the virus is the reason why this game is canceled.  I believe and I honestly do believe this, folks.  Sarah Fuller ripped that team at halftime of the previous game that she came in after that and made an awful kick.  And I believe that all the media attention that she was getting, the players were probably thinking, you know what?  We've been on this team, busting our ass the whole time.  We got zero attention.  Yeah, I know we're 0-8, but the media is acting like Sarah Fuller is some kind of a savior to this team.  And we know that is absolutely not the case.  And I believe, you know, that once Derek Mason was fired, The players just said, all right, enough is enough.  The WOTE sports needs to stop.  Sarah Fuller is not our savior.  But if you go to OutKick here, they're actually covering this as well.  And their headline is not about the virus.  They actually say, Vandy Georgia game canceled after Commodores can't meet roster requirements.  And overall, folks, that is the major reason why this game is actually canceled.  Now, there's a possibility that the game will be rescheduled for the 19th.  But that is only if Georgia is eliminated from the SEC championship game, I believe.  So if it's a game that doesn't mean anything, really, then they'll play the game.  But we will have to see what happens with that.  Now, here's the thing, folks.  This is why I'm not actually buying the virus excuse here.  Because we know that the virus is not going anywhere.  So what is actually going to happen between now and December 19th?  The virus is still going to be out there.  So I'm not buying this excuse whatsoever.  Now, like I said before, the world sports media, you know, they're going to try to make you think.  that the virus is the main issue.  No, it's not the Sarah Fuller issue.  I believe is the real deal.  I'm pretty sure that those players did not appreciate getting ripped by a woman that isn't even a football player that was never on the team before the last game.  And she ripped them.  I'm pretty sure that they felt very, very disrespected by her, by the team for doing this.  And probably even the university themselves, you know, To have the players get ripped by her is very, very disrespectful, man.  I really do believe that was very, very disrespectful to them.  Yeah, we know you guys are 0-8.  You guys are terrible.  And your coach just got fired.  But all this attention on Sarah Fuller, man.  She's the savior.  And there's some speculation out there, you know, that she may actually get some Heisman votes.  If she even gets one Heisman vote, folks... This will just prove my point, man, that Walt Sports is on another level.  If she gets one vote, then the Heisman is completely compromised.  It's went completely woke.  But would I be surprised if that actually happened?  No, I would not.  She will probably get one sympathetic Heisman vote.  You know, hell, they already made her the special teams player of the week in the SEC for making a terrible kick, a horrible, horrible kick.  But that's just my thoughts on this.  What do you guys think of this?  As I predicted, Vanderbilt will not have enough players to actually fill the team on December the 19th.  We'll actually do the game this Saturday, and it's probably going to actually be rescheduled for December the 19th.  This is all because of the wokeness, and it's not because of the virus whatsoever.  If you listen to the mainstream media, they're going to tell you this is COVID-19 related, and it 100% absolutely is not.  Players have opted out, and they're opting out because of the woke aspect of college football right now and the woke media just pushing Sarah Fuller like crazy.  A girl that isn't even a football player, a girl that was just on the field for social justice, and that was pretty much it.  Anyway, guys, let us know what you think about all this in the comments.
