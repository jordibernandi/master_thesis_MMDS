I did my whole teaching video on marriage and divorce and remarriage, and then I was going to tackle all your questions in a massive video.  But I realized if I separate this up into individual videos, it'll make these questions accessible through searching and people can find them when they need them instead of putting it in one long vid.  So this is the beginning of that.  I'm going to be answering, I don't know, 15 questions, approximately 16.  In short videos, this is the first one.  And here is the first question.  This question comes in from Nicole Modiotis, who says, okay, my question is this.  How does the Bible define marriage?  I've been with my partner for almost 12 years. ",
