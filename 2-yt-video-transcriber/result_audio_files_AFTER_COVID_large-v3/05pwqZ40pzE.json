We were barely able to hear a word from Joe Biden or moderator Chris Wallace thanks to Trump's incessant interruptions and nonstop insults.  Here are the most revealing moments from last night's debate.  Number one, Trump refused to disavow white supremacy.  He reiterated his baseless claims that anti-fascist groups and left-wing organizers were the ones causing violence, a narrative contradicted by multiple studies and his own national security officials.  The violence Trump claims is the greatest threat facing our country does not exist.  The latest draft of the Department of Homeland Security's threat assessment report characterizes white supremacy as the, quote, most persistent and lethal threat to national security.  Number two, both Biden and Trump showed us who they really are. ",
