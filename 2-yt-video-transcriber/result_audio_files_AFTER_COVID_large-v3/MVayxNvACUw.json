            "text": "It's a Gundam!  It's weird to talk about comic books on this channel.  Simply because I try to stay away from my feelings of what's happening in the comic book industry.  Because it would lead to the same sort of blind fury that you've seen me project into the world when it came to Star Wars.  But believe it or not, I guess I'm a comic book fan.  I mean, if you look at my computer room, you'll see comic books all over the walls.  In recent years, Marvel has been undergoing a lot of changes to the point of where... Long time comic book fans such as myself don't really support the company.  And for years, I know I've said it and many others have.  If you're going to try and push an agenda, at least make new characters.  Don't go screwing up the originals.  Don't make Spider-Man bisexual because it would make someone on Twitter feel special.  If they need Spider-Man to be bi to make them feel like their life is worth something... They're a lost cause.  It's over.  The fact that Wolverine and Cyclops are in a polyamorous relationship with Jean Grey now, and they're bisexual, also does not tickle my nuts with a feather.  But we're gonna let it go.  One of the stupidest ideas ever, dude.  One of the greatest rivalries.  You know, like, yeah, they're on the same team, but Wolverine and Cyclops do not see eye to eye.  Why in the name of God would you write this?  Because we're smoking.  crack is the only thing I can think of.  So, Let's just move on.  Marvel has now introduced some new characters for the New Warriors.  At first, when I heard this, I was, like, scratching my head, like, New Warriors.  Rings a bell.  Not sure.  I click into it, and it's the New Warriors I remember from being a kid.  The New Warriors used to be edgy as hell, dude.  Like, they had Night Thrasher.  They had Nighthawk.  Scarlet Spider was a member at one point.  Nova... Speedball, he's like more comic relief.  I never really cared for him as a character.  But during the 2000s when the Secret War, not the Secret War, the Civil War first launched, and it happened because of new warriors being irresponsible and Speedball leading to this big explosion that killed a lot of people.  Then it led to the Superhero Registration Act.  And now Marvel just did another Civil War to coincide with all the Marvel movies.  that made no sense because they're jackasses.  Then you got these Marvel writers.  now, we're on a tangent to Hellfit.  We got this one chick, I can't remember her name, and she came up with like this storyline where superheroes, like you can't be a superhero under the age of 21.  So it's basically the Superhero Registration Act again.  It's literally Civil War 3.  And we just did Civil War 2 a few years ago, but it's not called the Civil War.  But whatever, that leads to these douchebag characters.  And listen, I'm fine to exist because that way these people can write their shit stories and ruin something that isn't established.  You know, I don't want to see characters that are great get ruined.  So make your own new hyper woke characters and we'll all laugh when they fail.  Let's go with this.  Forgive me. ",

Your superheroes could kick ass in the 90s.  Punisher came around.  Let's just move on.  Long story short, it was a good time period.  Except for the fact that comic books then became like, they're worth more than stocks and bonds of gold.  And then it led to the comic book recession because everybody's buying comic books under the idea that they're going to be worth a lot of money.  And it's like, if you have one of Jim Lee's X-Men number one, which almost everybody who has comic books has at least one of those.  You know, it sold millions of copies.  Therefore, it's not worth more than dirt.  We're on a whole different tangent.  Sorry. ",

How long before New Warriors is dead like that comic book series Zoe Quinn was writing for Vertigo?  I give it a few episodes.  Now, if we go here on the webpage, right?  Teen living vampire exposed to Michael Morbis' blood as a child.  So, basically, that is canon.  Whatever.  Uh.  But life-saving medical procedure.  Still the same age as a regular kid.  But all the abilities of Morpheus.  Morbius, whatever.  He's also obsessed.  Do you know why they have this Morbius character?  Because they're doing a Morbius movie.  So that way it might drum up interest in this character.  And maybe people will buy the book because Jared Leto.  He also obsesses with all the music and attitude of a classic long past decades.  Like the 90s and the early 2000s.  The world is a vampire.  So am I. Oh my god.  It's a reference to a Smashing Pumpkin song.  Oh my god.  How old?  Jesus Christ.  They act like the kid is listening to something from like 1930.  It would have been weirder if they were like he was quoting The Wanderer or something.  B negative is a goth kid.  You don't even see those anymore.  Because Goth has now deteriorated to buying stuff from Hot Topic and wearing gas masks like a douchebag.  You know, it would have made more sense if this B negative kid was interested in The Cure.  That would have been at least decent writing.  You know, it would have been like, oh, B negative likes The Cure.  He's obsessed with Robert Smith.  Then you can see it.  You know, oh, he likes, what's that band called that wrote the song?  Bela Lugosi's Day.  Bauhaus music, too.  Not Smashing Pumpkins.  There's nothing goth about Smashing Pumpkins.  Just because Billy Corgan is pale doesn't make him goth.  Jesus Christ.  Ugh, this character art is trash.  Yeah, whatever.  If you ever needed more of a sign that the complicated industry is really killing itself with trying to be woke and all this other stuff, this is it.  Like, this is literally the clearest sign that, hey, we're out of touch.  We think you might buy this.  And the answer is no.  People who complain on the internet about like representation don't buy comic books.  They're not scouring the internet and websites trying to find stuff.  They literally get off on virtue signaling.  Now they virtue signaled your jackasses into making a book like this.  Get ready for it to be canceled because they're not going to buy it.  They never buy anything.  Except for like drag queen music.  That's it.  You better get this comic book on RuPaul's Drag Race.  It's the only way you get these assholes interested.  God, I don't even know.  How do you go from like the new warriors of old... The literally Night Thrasher's hanging out with the Punisher.  And now we got this.  Night Thrasher's teaching a non-binary kid.  What the hell's going on? ",
