Now not just the campaign, so it's not just the Trump campaign, but also individual citizen voters that feel like their election was diluted.  We've got a team now working in, and Andy and I have been working directly on this, in a situation in Georgia where a whole community of citizens apparently has had their votes they when they went to vote they said well you've already mailed in your ballot and this was hundreds of people.  and they did not mail in their ballots.  uh we've got.  I just got word of one in Georgia where there is a change of.  they said they denied him the right to vote.  the first time he went in saying he voted by ballot.  he went back in the second day to protest and they said oh you know what you're right you can go vote now.  Now, if that happened 1,300 times, there'd be no runoff for Senate if those votes were for the president.  That's an assumption.  There wouldn't be a runoff in Georgia for David Perdue's seat.  So, I mean, these numbers have real, real consequences. ",

            "text": "want to talk about specifically, folks, that I think is really important.  It's a lawsuit that was brought in the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan.  And this was brought by people themselves, electors, voters themselves.  When Pauline Monti, that was one of the plaintiffs, told an election worker that she was not able to see the monitor because they pushed it farther away from her, the election worker responded, quote, too bad.  Zachary Volpel, these are human beings, real people, folks, reported that an election supervisor called him an obscene name and told him not to ask questions about the balloting process and counting.  Kim Toko was personally intimidated and insulted by election workers, and this is a good one.  Quinn Schmidt was the target of a racist comment and asked, quote, what gives you the right to be here since you are not American?  Another election worker told a challenger, Jasmine Early, since, quote, English was not her first language, she should not be taking part in this process.  Now, this, folks, goes over and over and over in this complaint, which is over 30 pages long.  experience themselves. ",

            "text": "There seems to be from the government, the register of voters for the counties, a real disinterest in looking at the details.  We have a register of voter head, a guy named Joe Gloria, who says, I'm not capable of investigating all of these questions that are being raised about voters from outside of Nevada breaking the residency requirements or individuals who are voting who are clearly dead.  He has literally taken the position that he doesn't have the ability to investigate, that he has to keep to this timeline, and therefore he is pushing forward with processes that are reckless, knowing that they're reckless, but he's willing to say, I have to do it, I have no choice because I've got to meet this deadline.  We also, when we filed our court documents, asking the judge to look at this machine that is counting votes by comparing signatures and throwing certain signatures out if they don't match.  We have right now a judge who is saying that he also can't stop the counting because he's under the mandate from the Nevada legislature to finish counting by a certain date.  So literally what we have are government agencies and judges saying my hands are tied.  I know it's sloppy, but there's nothing I can do about it because I have to certify this election.  As somebody who has been on the ground in Nevada watching this, I think that people who vote legally should be really outraged that the system is sloppy.  We've known it's sloppy and government officials are just saying, oh, well, nothing we can do about it. ",
