            "text": "Ladies and gentlemen, there are many a people, there are many, many people who are hated on the internet by the reactionary community for more or less ridiculously absurd, contrived reasons.  Go to examples.  Anita Sarkeesian is probably a pretty big one, right?  AOC, pretty big one.  But there's another.  There is another.  Who is probably, as of late, the biggest, THE biggest target for these people.  And you guys already know it.  It's Brie Larson.  It's Brie Larson.  Okay, so Brie Larson is just, like, this actress.  She's apparently pretty good.  Apparently she won, like, an Oscar at some point for a movie called The Room.  I'm not, like, a super huge fan of Brie Larson as an actress.  I've only ever seen Captain Marvel.  But she seems like a fine person.  Like, you know, just like... I mean, she's rich.  I guess that's kind of bad.  But, I mean, other than that, she seems like... She seems like... Or Room.  Not The Room.  Room.  Like, just Room.  Not the Tommy Wiseau masterpiece, The Room.  Not that one.  Just Room.  So Brie Larson is just like an actress.  Like, she seems fine.  Like an okay person.  But these people... are so triggered by her for a variety of reasons.  One, she says things that are vaguely feminist at speeches and ceremonies and stuff like that.  She says vaguely feminist stuff.  She's a woman, and also she played... Captain Marvel, which is, like, a strong female character in, like, a nerdy, like, you know, in a superhero movie that's mostly, like, marketed towards nerdy white dudes, right?  So, whew.  That's, like, the trinity of things right there.  Being a woman, being vaguely feminist, and playing a character that is also, like, a feminist symbol, right?  That is the holy trinity to become, like, hated by these people on the internet.  So... You will be very happy to hear.  Brie Larson is now a YouTuber.  And I'm going to go ahead and drop a sub, because why not?  I'll even turn on the bell icon.  Brie Larson has made herself a YouTube channel.  Her first video has 1.4 million views.  Oh, look at that downvote ratio.  Ah, yeah.  I'm sure people aren't mad at all.  And she's already got about 231k subs, and she's verified.  Very nice.  Very cool.  Already eclipsing Vosh.  Vosh blown the fuck out.  So this is pretty neat, right?  Cool.  Yeah, not a big deal.  But... This is... Oh, God.  Look how many videos the quartering has made on Brie Larson.  Look at all... Look, these are all still... These are all still videos by the quartering about Brie Larson.  Oh, here's... Oof, look at all these ones by Geeks and Gamers.  Oh geez, that's a lot of videos by Geeks and Gamers about Brie Larson and Captain Marvel.  Oh geez, that's a lot of videos.  Oh look, we're still going?  Oh yeah, we're still going, we're still going.  We're, oh yeah, we're, oof, we're still going.  Nope, we're still going, it's not ended yet.  Nope, we're still going.  Are we- yep, we're still going.  Nope.  Nope, we're still going.  No, alright.  We're still going?  More?  Okay.  More.  More.  More.  More.  Are we finally getting to the end?  Oh, now we have Star Wars Girl, another reactionary YouTuber type ranting about Brie Larson.  Oh, nope, we got more!  Captain Marvel's box office numbers are a success, if they're true.  So, like, conspiracy theories about whether or not, like, there was, like, fake... They faked the box office numbers for Captain Marvel because Captain Marvel made, like, a billion dollars.  Because these people, like, ranted about how Captain Marvel would be a failure for, like, six months.  And then Captain Marvel made a billion dollars.  And now they're saying, well... See, they might be fake numbers.  Like, Disney might have artificially inflated them.  Like, okay, okay, dude, it's literally a Marvel movie.  They all get fucking... They all blow the fuck up and end up making, like, millions and, like, hundreds of millions and sometimes billions of dollars.  So.  So.  What does this mean?  What does the fact that Brie Larson has made a YouTube channel mean?  It means... this is now Brie Larson has cemented herself as more or less the second coming of GamerGate's Anita Sarkeesian because while there isn't really a name for it we are more or less in the second like the second wave of GamerGate.  like this is GamerGate 2. it's happening.  let me actually illustrate it for you guys.  um let me illustrate it for you guys really fast.  so Let's draw out like a timeline, right?  Like, like a timeline of events.  Okay.  So let's say this is 2014 right here.  We'll say this is 2015, 2016, 2017.  2018 2019 2020. ignore the insane spacing here.  to be fair 2014 to 2017 feels like a much longer amount of time than 2018 to 2020. so this is this kind of this kind of matches.  actually this does feel like a much longer amount of time than it.  well let's be honest here that it feels like 2014 to 2017 was like a lot longer than 2017 to 2020. it feels like it was a longer amount of time.  let's be completely honest here.  um It felt much longer than it really was.  So let's go over this here, right?  So in 20... Fuck, we'll go with this, right?  So in 2014... We had GamerGate, right?  GamerGate got reactionary, like, sentiment on the internet.  We'll imagine red means, like, how reactionary the internet is at that particular moment, right?  So GamerGate got the internet pretty reactionary, okay.  Then in 2015, we saw people like Sargon and whatnot start to really blow up, and okay, yeah, cool, cool.  Trump starts getting popular, right?  Trump's getting really popular.  The election comes around in 2016, reactionary shit peaks.  It fucking peaks in 2016, okay?  It gets massive.  massive in 2016, like, around the time Trump gets elected.  But then Trump wins the election, and he starts doing terrible shit.  And a lot of, like, the more liberal skeptic YouTubers that at least have, like, a little bit of decency, you know, like ShoeOnHead, ChrisRagan, they stop making reactionary content as much, and it starts to drop a little bit.  Then people like Sean and people like Contra and PhilosophyTube start to get popular.  And it starts to drop a little bit more.  Maybe something small happens that like, like the, like, yeah, we'll say we get a little jump when the PewDiePie N-word drama happens, you know, and people come out of the woodwork to defend PewDiePie saying the N-word.  But for the most part, we start dropping back down again.  We start dropping back down.  I would say that it like gets to its lowest it's ever been in 2018.  Here.  I would say that reactionary rhetoric on the internet gets the lowest it's been in a long fucking time in 2018.  This is when, like, BreadTube really started to blow up.  And then, in early 19, despite BreadTube getting really big, Christchurch shooting happens.  Reactionary YouTubers start getting popular again.  The Quartering, Tim Pool, Geeks and Gamers, all of those types, they're getting really big again.  And I'd say we're more or less around here in 2020 with like the Brie Larson, like ranting about Star Wars and Brie Larson and Last of Us being SJW, all of that.  I'd say we are more or less now rising up in the second, it's like the second wave.  We're hitting our second wave.  We're more or less at where we were as the, around the fall of the anti-SJW skeptic community back in like 2017 towards the ass end of 2016, right?  We're getting up there.  And if it keeps on rising in this direction with like Brie Larson as the new fucking Anita Sarkeesian with the Twitch deer girl as like the new Brianna Wu and with, um, uh, uh, what's her name?  Uh, who is it?  Who's what, who is it that I'm thinking of?  That's like the go-to thing or like, um, you know, the last of us two is there as they're rallying fit as a rallying cry of, of a game ruined by the SJW agenda, even though it's a perfectly fine game.  Um, Yeah.  It seems like we're on our way to a pretty- another big wave of reactionary thought on YouTube perpetuated instead by- instead of, like, having overtly political content like Sargon and, you know, Chris Reagan and Schwan had like it was back in the day and, like, you know, your Andy Worskies and all of that.  Instead... it's going to be by people like the quartering, by people like Tim Pool.  Tim Pool is more on the overtly political side, but the quartering and geeks and gamers claim not to be political, and that's where a lot of their power comes from.  As well as up-and-coming new YouTubers who have only been doing this for a while, like, um... God, I do want to cover one of these dudes' videos, uh, in a while.  But more or less people who, while may not be overtly political, do dip into somewhat reactionary rhetoric occasionally.  For example, this YouTuber, Bow Blacks, he's gotten pretty big as of recently.  He's like a drama channel, like a sort of, like a milquetoast, sort of approximating Keemstar type dude, right?  He does like Twitter drama and YouTuber drama.  And he definitely dips into the reactionary shit from time to time.  You know, Karen thinks cops in video games are racist.  Okay, I mean, that's his video from five days ago, almost 100,000 views.  So not overtly political, but more or less nothing different from the old reactionary shit of 2015, 2016, back in the peak of like the anti-SJW community.  This seems to be what the new wave of reactionary, skeptic, anti-SJW fervor on the internet is going to be like pushed by.  It's a new wave.  It's like the second wave of the corona coming in the United States.  That's what it's all about.  So more or less, if it does so happen that there's going to be a new wave of reactionary thought online since, you know, the old guard have sort of been banned or become irrelevant now besides like a few people like Sargon and Tim Pool.  And there's going to be a new generation of reactionary YouTubers that are going to mask their reactionary rhetoric and like humor and in not being political.  I'm going to be around to call them out.  I'm going to be here.  We're going to be doing it.  It's going to be a good time.  So stick along for that ride.  It's going to be a good time.  It's gonna be fun. ",
