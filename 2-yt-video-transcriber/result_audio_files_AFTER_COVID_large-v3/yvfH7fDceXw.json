Did you go into black neighborhoods and take polls?  So you know whether or not you're representing their views?  Uh, totally.  I was like, what do you want white America to know?  And they were like, the nuclear family is totally an oppressive social construct.  And gender is fluid.  Get used to it, cracker.  So they wanted to get rid of the nuclear family.  Of course, dude!  It causes cancer!  What a coincidence that their politics aligned exactly with those of a white upper-middle class liberal arts student.  I know, it's weird!  It's like they're the perfect tool, uh, I mean group of people for the left to care about in hell!  That is weird, considering they tend to be more conservative on social issues like gay marriage.  Chubby, now is the time for white people to be quiet and listen to black people repeat leftist talking points created by white people.  And what if a black person disagrees with BLM?  And you ain't black.  Seems circular.  No, it isn't!  Because our solutions will help black people.  Oh, wow.  Well, no one else is claiming that.  I know, right?  Psych!  Yeah!  Gone!  Psych!  Alright, well, my point is, a lot of people have different solutions to the problems black people are facing.  That doesn't make them immune from criticism.  And by the way, the most obvious solution based on the data is promoting two-parent homes.  But you refuse to do that.  Stop trying to hijack the movement with your religious rhetoric!  We hijacked it first with our commie rhetoric!  Ugh!  Fine.  You wanna talk about the part of BLM actually concerned with black lives?  You stand for actual victims like George Floyd, but then cheapen it by advocating for guys who got shot trying to kill cops, like Michael Brown.  You repeat, hands up, don't shoot, even though Eric Holder's Justice Department debunked that entire narrative.  You claim unarmed black men are constantly killed by the police, but it only happened eight times in 2019, and some of those were self-defense.  Ugh!  Shut up!  Your insolence enrages me!  Boys!  Attack!  Dang coronavirus! ",
