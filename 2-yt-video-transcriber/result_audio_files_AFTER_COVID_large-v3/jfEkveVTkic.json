            "text": "Hey, welcome to Viking Preparedness, I'm Pastor Joe Fox.  This is a video just for YouTube.  If any of y'all have been following me for a while, of late, my YouTube videos have been Patreon videos that are a couple weeks old that I post on YouTube, but I'm shooting this one just for y'all.  The reason I went to Patreon is because, you know, I was on YouTube and and doing well, and it was providing breakfast.  Okay, I mean, I'm just getting real.  And then they decided they didn't like people like me, and it ticked me off.  And if you're interested in all the drama, you can go back and look at old videos.  And so I went to Patreon.  And on Patreon, I do do a video pretty much every day, and I do written word and yada yada.  And I pour my heart and soul Out to the Vikings on Viking Preparedness on Patreon.  But I care about you too.  You stubborn you who don't want to spend three cents a day to come see PJ.  Right?  And I've been thinking lately.  I'm trying one more time to wake everybody up.  wake you up, if you're not already awake.  And if not, you can share this video.  You know, if you are, but you know others who aren't, you can maybe share this video.  We are fixing to go through some amazing changes in life.  And I want you to be ready.  I want you to do well with what's coming.  There's certain themes and certain things I hit over and over and over on Patreon.  The two biggest threats to you in a calamity, in a, you know, catastrophe that happens, starvation and people behaving badly.  And the best things you can do to mitigate those threats to you and yours is to move to a rural area and store a lot of food.  Wow, what a concept.  And then grow your own food and produce your own food and homestead and yada, yada, yada.  And I know this, a lot of y'all are waking up to that fact a bit late.  But you're waking up.  People, you know, semi-rural property around Minneapolis is just skyrocketing in price.  Because people are figuring out, oh, we don't want to be in the cities.  Come out of here, my people.  And they're moving out.  And so I thought I would just give you some things from my heart on what you really should do.  I know a lot of y'all don't like being told what you should do.  But you really should.  You need to store food.  Food right now is cheap.  No, prices are going up.  But food is cheap.  And you need to store up, stock up a lot of food.  Because think about it.  You know, preppers, right?  We like our guns.  We like our kit.  We like our stuff.  At the end of the day, you're going to eat.  You're going to have to eat.  You're going to want to eat.  You may not.  And ooh, this is probably uncool for a prepper channel.  You're probably not going to have to shoot anybody.  But you are going to have to eat.  And so y'all need to be stocking food.  And I tell the patrons this every day.  Well, you know, not every day.  You need to be stocking your food to the rafters.  Not just for you, but for other people who are going to join you.  And you're going to want people.  See, this is the thing we do on Patreon, on Viking Preparedness on Patreon.  We organize what I call Viking Meetups.  And it's where like-minded people come together, and then they all touch antennas, and then these four go off and form their own MAGRA crew, and these six go off and form their own MAGRA crew.  Mike Glover is doing something with, I don't even remember what he calls it, but he's doing something.  Yeah, go figure, because we all know you need people.  And so I'm trying to facilitate that.  And I tell the Vikings on Patreon, you don't have to be a Patreon member to come to these meetings.  But the only way you're going to find out about it is if a Viking member tells you about it.  You need people.  You need food.  And you need to get out of those damn cities.  Have you figured that out yet?  A lot of people, if you haven't figured that out yet, a lot of people have figured it out ahead of you, which is why property in the near rural areas to major metropolitan areas is getting very expensive.  Because people are buying it.  They want a hidey hole.  They want a bolt hole.  They want a bug out location.  A B-O-L.  What are you doing?  See, the people on Patreon are pretty serious.  80% of the people on Patreon are taking real steps towards preparedness.  And I think 50% of the people on YouTube are eating Doritos and drinking Diet Coke.  That's just entertainment, man.  But I'm telling you... You should quit looking at it as entertainment because I know you watch me you watch other people and that's cool.  But watching is one thing doing is another and you all need to start doing.  you need to start making the moves.  You don't have much time and I feel for you.  I mean literally my heart aches for you.  Food.  being away from people because what people you know?  on the one hand i say you need people you need a tribe you need a mag you need a crew.  on the other hand i say you need to get away from people.  yep yep because people are the problem.  if you're living on a deserted island with all your needs taken care of you know medical nutritional, whatever.  You don't have any problems.  But that's not the case.  And you're going to need people.  I talk about that on Viking Preparedness.  I'm not trying to make a commercial for that.  I'm being honest.  And I do not come on YouTube a whole lot anymore because it's just not worth my effort.  But I still care for you.  And so that's why I'm here.  People, the world is fixing to get cray cray.  What are you gonna do about it?  You know it's going to.  You can look around and see things and you know it's gonna go bad, like bad, bad.  What are you doing about it?  I am imploring you to get ready.  Something wicked this way comes.  You cannot have too much training.  You cannot have too much food.  You cannot have too much ammo.  You can't have too many guns.  You can't carry them all, right?  The best solution for what's coming is to move out to a rural area and become what we call ourselves a neopioneer.  Be a producer, not a consumer.  Produce your own food.  Produce your own utilities.  Produce your own, you know, services.  Learn how to deal with medical problems, issues.  Too many of y'all are watching videos of, yeah, man, whatever makes you say that.  Or, oh, that's so cute.  You're wasting time.  You need to unplug and you need to go do the things.  Meet people, create, form, join, tribe, stock food to the rafters.  I'm pleading, I'm imploring, I'm, you know, cajoling, whatever.  I want you all to be ready for what's coming.  I don't think we have much time.  And you know when I do videos on YouTube, because I have a much broader audience on YouTube than I do on Patreon.  But because of that, I get the stupidest, what do you think is going to happen, Pastor Joe?  What do you think is going to happen?  If you can't tell, if you can't come up with five scenarios of things that you think are going to happen that's going to significantly change your life, yeah, you're eating Doritos and sucking down Diet Coke.  You're not paying attention.  And I can't help you at that point.  I don't answer questions on YouTube.  I do it on Patreon.  I don't reply to most comments on YouTube.  I don't even read most comments on YouTube.  It's a time thing, people.  I get people on here on YouTube who say, you should give us this for free because you buy textbooks for free, right?  I feel for you guys.  My heart aches for you.  It really does.  To the extent that you can.  And don't make excuses for yourself.  Because you can.  Come out of her my people.  Come out of those built up areas.  They're just going to be.  Places of chaos.  come to a place where you can hear roosters, try to raise your own food to the extent that you can and meet the local people and decide.  this is our line and nonsense is not coming across this line.  If I say much more, YouTube will remove this video.  Wake up, smell the coffee, look around, and start doing the things.  You don't have much time.  I'll see you out there. ",
