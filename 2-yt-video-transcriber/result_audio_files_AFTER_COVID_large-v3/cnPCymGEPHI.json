And it's like after multiple losses, I don't know what more they want, but I do know that it's not helping a left or progressive effort.  If I could ask, I guess the only thing I'd ask you before we get to Ben, one, are you interested in this enormous opportunity?  And two, do you think that there is something, though, is there a lesson in the failure of her campaign about trying to triangulate between really trying to decommodify society to some extent and just the sort of same old democratic neoliberalism?  I mean, her campaign was kind of predicated on big change without real big change. ",

            "text": "The way I read it is, first of all, I would not give money because that kind of money that I set aside, I've already given to four televangelists.  So I'm just out of any extra to give anybody.  Because saving my soul is clearly a higher priority than saving the United States.  Look, here's how I read it.  The middle is collapsing because the consensus of the last 40, 50, 60 years that we're going to have a quote unquote booming capitalism with a big fat middle class that is going to go upward and onward, that isn't true anymore.  It's taken several decades for the reality of it to sink in.  It took that long because people could paper over the end of real wage increases by borrowing.  And they've run out.  They can't do that on the scale they once did.  And so it's over.  And if you want to get votes, you've got to be able to offer people the idea of change.  But the Republicans and Democrats, the Bushes, the Clintons, and all of that, that's not what they are.  They are the people who rode in on the consensus.  In the earlier phases, because it was real, in the later phases, like Bill Clinton, on the fakery of debt, a debt-driven reality instead of a growth-driven reality.  And so the smartest among them realized they've got to put forward a candidate of real change.  The first genius stroke in that was to put forward Barack Obama, because take one look at him, and you notice something.  He's a black person, and we never had that in this country before, and most Americans didn't think they'd ever see it.  And so you didn't have to make a big argument about change, because this was change.  The fact that he didn't have a program, that he hadn't been in long enough even to learn what exactly that meant, what difference does it make?  He could get advisors.  He would get advisors.  All the conventional Democrats would help him.  He was the symbol. ",

And if you look at some of the statistics of what happened to homeownership among African Americans, his time was a disaster.  There's a joke in the African American community I heard the other day.  The price of getting a black man in a white house was that the black people lost their houses.  But, you know, it has its grain of truth.  Right.  Okay, he's done.  In comes another change.  This time you know it's a change because it's this sleazy, narcissistic, weird hustler.  Right.  And he doesn't hide it.  He makes a virtue out of all of his uncouthness.  So he's different, and he can get the right wing to say, hey, He's going to give them the finger in this establishment.  So now we are four or five years, you know, four years of that or three and a half.  And it's becoming clear to more and more people. ",
