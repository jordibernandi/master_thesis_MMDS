            "text": "Good morning, people.  Watchwoman65, Lisa Boyce here.  I'm just coming on with a quick video this morning.  I saw this article.  Tim had hit about this about seven or eight hours ago.  And it was sent to me by Jay off of Facebook.  It's off of breaking Israeli news about the Israeli health minister saying that I'm sure their Messiah, which is the Antichrist... We'll arrive by Passover.  I'm going to read this.  This is a short article.  I'm going to read this to you.  It says in an interview on Shemel News on Thursday, Israelis Health Minister Yaakov Litzman was asked what he's doing to stop the growing coronavirus pandemic in Israel.  Lisman responded, reminding the Israeli people to wash their hands to ensure social distancing and not to congregate in places with more than 10 people.  Minister added that if people don't comply, it will be problematic.  And of course, people aren't applying, replying, complying to it.  Not too many people are.  He also added that God is watching over us.  OK, now keep in mind when they're talking about their Messiah returning, they're not talking about Jesus Christ, the Messiah.  They're talking about the Antichrist.  So I'm going to replace their word for Messiah for the Antichrist, which is who it really is.  Okay.  As the head of an ultra-Orthodox party, references to God are being expected.  But when asked about the chances of Israel continuing to be under complete shutdown until Passover holiday, his response was, God forbid.  He said that we are praying and hoping that the Antichrist will arrive, they're using the Messiah, but I'm saying the Antichrist, which is who it really is, will arrive before Passover.  And as it is a time of our redemption, I am sure the Messiah, the Antichrist, will come by Passover and save us the same way.  God saved us during the Exodus and we were freed.  The Mashiach The Antichrist will come and save us all.  That's what they're saying in that article.  That's a short article and I thought I would read it to you because, like I said, they're Messiah.  They're not looking for Jesus Christ.  They're looking for the Antichrist.  Now, I'm not giving a date of the rapture.  I'm not saying anything.  I'm just going by what this article is saying.  Could we be raptured by then?  Well, according to the word of God, the church is raptured before the Antichrist steps on the scene.  Like I said before, the Antichrist is alive and well.  He just don't know who he's representing right now.  But he is definitely alive.  I wanted to come on there and give you that little bit of information this morning.  And I also am going to come back later and I'm going to do something on martial law.  and give you the true meaning of martial law, and how they don't use martial law, the word martial law today, but they got it in other words, like national emergency and stuff like that.  So I'm going to, I found this off of, I found that article too, and I'm going to give you that.  But I'm going to link the description, this article in the description box in my blog.  comment section by all means comment on it.  i mean he's saying that their their messiah is going to arrive by passover.  now passover is between april 7th i think april 7th and april 16th.  i think that so.  could we be raptured by then?  i don't know we might.  we should.  i hope.  i hope we are.  i'm praying for it but i wanted to come on this morning and give you that.  um And I wanted to, like I said, I'll be back later to give you this article on martial law.  There was a little hiccup there because my screen changed from dark to light, from night to daylight.  But anyway, I'll be back on later.  Have a nice morning. ",
