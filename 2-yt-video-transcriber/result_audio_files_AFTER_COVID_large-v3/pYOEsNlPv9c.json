It is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.  The carnal natural mind of man is in a place of hostility towards God.  This is obvious when you hear people blaspheme the name of the God that gave them life.  There's a state of hostility, and when you address that carnal mind with apologetics, Noah's Ark, artifacts, hypocrites in the church, when you stay in the realm of apologetics, you are addressing the carnal mind, that place of enmity.  Now, I believe in apologetics.  I've got a Bible called the Evidence Bible that is packed full of apologetics.  I use apologetics, but I see them as bait and not the hook.  when you go fishing all you do is disguise the hook with a bait and so i bait the intellect with apologetics but i always move to the hook of god's law.  so if you want to reach someone for the gospel don't stay in the realm of the carnal mind.  you've got to go to the area of harmony and not enmity.  so where is that area of harmony?  well romans 2 verse 14 and 15 tells us the carnal mind is enmity against god But God has given us the conscience to address.  This is what Jesus addressed when he spoke to the rich young ruler.  This is what Paul addressed in Romans chapter 2 when he said, You who say you shall not steal, do you steal?  You who say you shall not commit adultery, do you commit adultery?  The Bible says the conscience is the work of the law written upon the heart.  Romans 2.15 says, which show the work of the law written upon the heart, the conscience bearing witness.  The thoughts of me might accusing or else excusing one another.  So the work of the law, the semblance of the law, the echo of the law is written upon the heart of every unsaved person.  Conscience means with knowledge.  So everyone affirms the truth of the commandments when you address the conscience, that impartial judge on the core of the mind.  So this is where you're going to see a deliberate swing from the carnal mind to addressing the conscience. ",

The Bible says if you repent, that is don't hang on to your sins, don't play the hypocrite and say I'm a Christian and lie and steal and blaspheme and lust.  If you truly repent, let go of your sins and trust in Christ like you trust a parachute, God will grant you forgiveness of sins and everlasting life as a free gift.  That's the promise of the Bible and it'll make sense to you if you acknowledge your sins.  I mean, if you told me someone's paid you fine and I says, I haven't broken the law, the fine paying is just ridiculous.  But if I say I've broken the law and you say someone's paid you fine, then it'll make sense.  So if you'll acknowledge your sins, listen to your conscience and say, boy, I've sinned against God.  I didn't think sin was serious, but God certainly does.  He gives the death sentence.  Then the gospel will make sense to you.  Viral, I'm not asking you to believe the Bible.  There's a lot of stories in there that are hard to swallow.  Jonah and the whale's hard to swallow.  Noah and the ark's hard to swallow.  But I don't want you to believe those.  I don't want to put the cart before the horse.  I just want you to believe the gospel.  And if you put the horse before the cart, believe the gospel, then you'll believe the Bible because it's God's instruction book.  He'll open the eyes of your understanding the moment you're born again.  So please just consider the gospel.  Think about your own sins.  Think about the secret ones you thought that no one has seen but God has seen.  Think about what Christ did on the cross.  Think about your soul and how valuable your life is. ",
