            "text": "Thank you.  One week from the election, and the courts can't keep up with Republicans pushing to disenfranchise voters.  Yesterday, it was nothing but an East Coast affair, and in two battleground states and the District of Columbia.  I don't know what to say, but I do have the intel on what went down and how it'll impact the general election on November 3rd.  I'm Attorney Adrienne Lawrence, and this is Overruled.  Welcome to TYT Overruled, where you get to be the judge.  Since the courts are blowing up right now and everybody is tired, let's just go ahead and jump into this.  I'll give you the three election voting-related rulings of this midweek, not even the beginning of the week, not the end of the week, but just midweek.  and how they're going to impact Election Day.  First, SCOTUS issued an L to North Carolina Republicans who wanted to limit the window of time that absentee ballots can be counted.  They wanted to restrict it to just three days, saying that November 6 would be the cutoff because that's what North Carolina law said.  But the State Board of Elections had unilaterally already decided to extend the window of time to November 12th, making it nine days.  And of course, the Republicans got super pissed.  They ran to Justice Thomas, hoping that he'd be able to help them out a bit.  Well, Thomas said he'd be happy to help him out, along with Gorsuch and Alito, but it was just the three of them.  Baird abstained because she had just gotten on the job.  Chief Justice Roberts and frat boy Brett decided to side with Breyer, Kagan, and Sotomayor.  That left a 5-3 vote against North Carolina Republicans.  And that means in North Carolina, they're going to enjoy that extra six days to count the absentee ballots.  That is a big win there.  Second, in Pennsylvania, Republicans ran to SCOTUS, demanding the court decide before election day whether Pennsylvania absentee ballots can be counted up to three days after the election.  No, this isn't an instant replay.  What happened was is that Pennsylvania Republicans had made this attempt just about last week.  They just did it in a different filing.  But they lost on a four to four party line vote.  So why did they come back this week?  Because they were hoping that Justice Amy Coney Barrett would be here to help them out.  But she just got on the job.  She couldn't vote in this one.  She opted not to.  So that meant that the Pennsylvania Republicans didn't get the win here again either.  SCOTUS said no, they're not going to decide the issue right now, and they won't be able to rule on it at least before Election Day.  But they may be able to look at it afterwards.  And that's not awesome because Coney Barrett could be fully on the job next week.  And with Pennsylvania being a battleground state, that could be kind of scary in the event that SCOTUS has enough votes to vote in favor of Pennsylvania Republicans and end up throwing out a sizable amount of absentee ballots.  But let's hope that doesn't happen.  We'll see.  And finally, at least we can close out on some good news in the District of Columbia, where federal Judge Emmett Sullivan is staying unapologetic in fighting the Trump administration.  If you recall, Judge Sullivan is the one who refused to dismiss the charges against Trumpster Michael Flynn, and Sullivan fought him in the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, and he won.  Well, yesterday, Sullivan granted an emergency motion against Trump.  Sullivan ordered the US Postal Service to remove the mail collection limits that Trump had imposed and to send Sullivan daily updates on the number of trips that the postal workers were making at national, regional, and local levels.  Yeah, Judge Sullivan isn't here for Trump's veiled efforts to interfere with mail-in voting.  This judge is single-handedly restoring faith in the judiciary, and I am here for it.  So there you go.  Those are the three big voter-related rulings just from midweek before Election Day.  And they all seem to be very anti-Republican party.  I can get behind that, but I would like to know your thoughts.  Chime in below and feel free to follow us.  I'm Adrienne Lawrence, and I'll catch you later. ",
