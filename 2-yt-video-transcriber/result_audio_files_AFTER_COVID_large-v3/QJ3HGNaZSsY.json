            "text": "Thank you.  Good afternoon, everyone.  Thank you for the warm welcome.  Michael, thanks for your leadership of this incredibly important institution.  And Bob, congratulations on returning to the helm of VOA.  I am truly happy to be here.  I'm honored to have been requested.  And it's always fun to be with a fellow tanker, too.  I want to acknowledge the other network chiefs who is with us today, Steve Yates of Radio Free Asia.  Steve, where you at?  Nice to see you.  And a note of appreciation, too, to the voice of American journalist staff and to all those watching and listening.  I've sat down for interviews with many of you in the far corners of the world.  They have always been a joy.  And speaking of which, too, I understand that this speech is being broadcast on TV, radio, on your website, social media, in more than 40 languages.  Hats off to the translators.  I have no idea how anyone can translate my talking into Uzbek this quickly.  That guy or gal deserves a bonus.  It's great to have this opportunity.  I've been following the work of Voice of America for decades.  And as Bob just mentioned, I started my career as an Army officer patrolling the Iron Curtain, Freedom's Frontier in the 1980s.  I couldn't cross into East Germany.  I was serving in a little town called Binloch.  West Germans couldn't cross either.  But your broadcast, Voice of America broadcast, could.  Millions of men and women.  whose names we'll never know, listen to you, often at their own peril.  Their governments dealt only in lies and propaganda, but VOA's listeners wanted the truth, and that's what you gave them.  VOA's very first broadcast in 1942 that Bob referred to began with the Battle Hymn of the Republic, along with this pledge, quote, The news may be good, the news may be bad, but we'll tell you the truth.  I love that.  I always told my son \u2013 I told this story before when he was growing up \u2013 I said, work hard, keep your faith, and tell the truth.  He mostly followed my advice.  And it has served him and many of you, I know, well.  Your mandate here at Voice of America is unambiguous \u2013 to be accurate, objective, and comprehensive, and to represent America.  The mission of USAGM is to inform, engage, and connect people around the world in support of freedom and democracy.  That's because expanding freedom and democracy are what America has always been about.  You're the voice of American exceptionalism.  We should be proud of that.  The world needs VOA's clarion call for freedom, now more than ever.  I hear it wherever I go.  That's what I wanted to talk about today.  I tell audiences about American exceptionalism wherever and whenever I can, because it's true and because it's important.  America is good and great, and everyone who truly grabs our founding understands this.  Michael and Bob have made studying this history their life's work.  Many of you have made it your life's mission too.  That's why you work here at Voice of America.  We were indeed the first nation founded on the central belief that all human beings are endowed with certain unalienable rights and that governments are instituted to secure those God-given rights.  We have always striven for a more perfect union.  And goodness knows we don't always get it right.  Therefore, we need both pride and humility about our past and our present.  We need the truth.  But it's very clear that when Americans have united around our founding values, be it in Philadelphia, at Gettysburg, at Seneca Falls, or during Martin Luther King's March on Washington, we've made good on our founding promise time and time again.  Now, our adversaries try and claim otherwise.  When the Chinese Communist Party attempted to exploit the tragic death of George Floyd to claim their authoritarian system was somehow superior to ours, I issued a statement which read in part, quote, During the best of times, the People's Republic of China ruthlessly imposes communism.  But amid the most difficult challenge, the United States secures freedom.  There is no moral equivalence.  This is a self-evident truth.  It is not fake news for you to broadcast that this is the greatest nation in the history of the world and the greatest nation that civilization has ever known.  Indeed, I'm not saying this to ignore our faults.  Indeed, just the opposite.  It is to acknowledge them.  But this isn't the vice of America focusing on everything that's wrong with our great nation.  It's the voice of America.  It certainly isn't the place to give authoritarian regimes in Beijing or Tehran a platform.  Your mission is to promote democracy, freedom, and American values all across the world.  The U.S.  taxpayer-funded institution aimed squarely at that.  Indeed, this is what sets VOA apart from MSNBC and Fox News and the like.  You can give voice to the voiceless in dark corners of the world.  You're the voice of American striving.  You're the voice of American exceptionalism.  You are indeed the tip of freedom's spear.  Now look, like many government agencies after the Cold War ended, our international broadcasters, well, they lost their way.  Many of you know this.  And there were, I'm sure, many reasons.  The Soviet Union had collapsed.  The wall had come down.  Names like bin Laden and Zarqawi and Baghdadi weren't widely known.  In fact, many wrote that history was over, we allowed security protocols to lapse, and VA lost its commitment to its founding mission.  Its broadcasts had become less about telling the truth about America and too often about demeaning America.  In 2013, one of my predecessors described the Broadcasting Board of Governors as, quote, practically defunct, end of quote.  Look, that's in part why Congress created the role of CEO of the USAGM on a bipartisan basis.  And it is again why I'm here today.  I read that some VIP employees didn't want me to speak here today.  I'm sure it was only a handful.  They didn't want the voice of American diplomacy to be broadcast on the Voice of America.  Think about that for just a moment.  Look, we're all part of institutions with duties and responsibilities higher and bigger and more important than any one of us individually.  But this kind of sensorial instinct is dangerous.  It's morally wrong.  Indeed, it's against your statutory mandate here at VOA.  Censorship, wokeness, political correctness, it all points in one direction.  Authoritarianism cloaked as moral righteousness.  Similar to what we're seeing at Twitter and Facebook and Apple and on too many university campuses today.  It's not who we are.  It's not who we are as Americans.  And it's not what Voice of America should be.  It's time that we simply put wokeism to sleep.  And you can lead the way.  You all know.  That's why you came here.  There's a new dawn here at Voice of America.  The American public doesn't know this, but when Michael took office, some 1,500 employees, almost 40% of the workforce, had been improperly vetted, including many with high-level security clearances.  VOA was rubber-stamping J-1 visas for foreign nationals, including some from communist China.  We shouldn't be doing that.  We have plenty of Mandarin language speakers here in America, and we are building, growing, teaching, educating more committed patriots, some of Chinese American descent who are amazing people.  The Trump administration team is working to fix these national security threats.  We want to vet employees properly.  We want to reorient VOA to its mission of truth and unbiased reporting.  We want to depoliticize what takes place here.  It's too important for the American people and for the world.  Returning this organization to its charter and its charge to spread the message of freedom, democracy, and American exceptionalism.  This isn't about politicizing these institutions.  We're trying to take politics out.  And that's a pretty good feature story for whoever wants to write it up.  As Secretary of State, I'm telling you all of this because I want the best for the people here and for this organization because you are vital to helping America shine light into the darkest places with the power that only America can muster.  Governments like those in China, Iran, North Korea, they don't have the respect for the universal dignity of every human being in the way that America does.  Indeed, that is what America was founded upon.  Those regimes are anathema to everything that our nation stands for.  We.  We know that government exists to serve people.  They.  They believe that people exist to serve government.  And VOA's work is vital.  As I said before, the tip of freedom's spear.  Every week, 278 million people listen to VOA in 47 languages.  There are Iranians who are listening to you, wondering if they'll ever be able to shed their Islamist shackles.  There are Moldovans and Ukrainians who want truthful reporting, not Russian disinformation and propaganda.  There are Chinese citizens who are tired of a regime that's done nothing but brutalize them since 1949.  There are Venezuelans who want to know the truth of the Maduro regime's corruption.  There are oppressed people all over the globe who still turn to America for hope.  Now, I know many of you, especially those of you overseas, continue and have done heroic work.  Thank you.  I want to commend VOA's Hong Kong reporting team, which faced political intimidation, harassment and attacks, but still got the job done.  My highest praise.  Well done.  You were behind the barricades of the freedom fighters telling their stories.  You're upholding VOA's finest traditions and continuing to be the voice of American exceptionalism.  I also want to pay tribute to members of the other radio services who are here and listening.  The only Uyghur language news service in the world is run by RFA.  You've told everyone who will listen, indeed some who didn't want to, the truth about the CCP's atrocities against its own people in Xinjiang, the stain of the century.  And you've done so despite the fact that the CCP has jailed the relatives of at least six RFA journalists.  in Xinjiang's internment camps and continues to threaten you and your families simply for doing your jobs.  Your work takes courage.  Please keep telling everyone who will listen what's happening in the toughest parts of the world.  The world expects it, and America will be better off for it.  I want to leave you with a quote that conveys why the VOA's mission is so critical before I take some questions from Bob.  This quote's from a ways back.  It's from George Washington.  He said, quote, truth will ultimately prevail where there is pains to bring it to light.  End of quote.  When America brings truth to the world, we bring light.  Don't forget that.  It's what you do.  May God bless you.  May God bless the voice of America and God bless these United States.  Thank you all. ",
