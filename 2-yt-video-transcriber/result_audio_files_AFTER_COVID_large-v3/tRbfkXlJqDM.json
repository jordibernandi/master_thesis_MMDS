And once again, we've got two idiots with badges, or two lying cops, which we see both quite often.  More often than not, but they are threatening him with the rest for not trespassing.  And we see it all the time.  How many times have we seen it?  You haven't gone on somebody's property.  They don't like you with a camera, even though you're on public property and they call the police to have you trespassed from a business you've never even been on.  And the two idiots with badges go ahead and do it.  Don't even investigate to see if he's been on property.  Just start threatening with the rest, trying the intimidation stuff.
