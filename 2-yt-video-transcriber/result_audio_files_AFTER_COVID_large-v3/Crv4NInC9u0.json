            "text": "One African leader or one African government minister owns more than his entire village.  And the tragedy is that that minister still goes to church on Sunday and says, Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.  Thy kingdom come and thy will be done on earth.  And he is a thief.  Many African leaders tell us on a daily basis that we have improved the education situation in our countries.  Oh, but ask them to take their children to those schools.  No.  Their children will go to the United States of America.  Their children will go to Australia.  Their children will go to France.  Their children will go to Portugal.  So it is you and me who are God forsaken.  Who take our children to schools which are local.  Talk of low self-esteem.  African leaders have also become hunters and gatherers.  Our ancestors gathered wild fruits.  In this country they must have gathered those fruits in the Namib and the Kalahari desert.  In Kenya they must have gathered them in the Chalbi desert.  But today our leaders are in the business of gathering cars and buildings and many things.  And yet I remember one great philosopher saying that there are people so poor in the world that the only thing they have is money.  And there is no shortage of such individuals in Africa.  People who engage in primitive accumulations.  Our leaders of this habit of accumulating things even had a bed of gold.  But the tragedy is that when you have a bed of gold even sleep will have deserted you and what you must do is to take sleeping pills to sleep but even then you cannot sleep.  I am submitting to us that the problem of Africa as Chinua Achebe said is simply and squarely a problem of leadership.  That is the problem in Africa.  And why do I say experience has demonstrated without number that where the leadership is good and sound, Greg Mills, the great South African, advising Paul Kagame and writing after the event, said that the problem of Africa and the reason why Africans are poor is because their leaders have made that choice.  He said that poverty is now optional, but the African leaders have made the choice that they are going to worship at the altar of the gods of poverty.  And I'm submitting to us that experience has demonstrated that poverty can be dealt with.  If you look at other civilizations, you remember at one time Turkey, which was then known as the Ottoman Empire, was called the sick man of Europe.  When Atat\u00fcrk came in Turkey, he became a dictator.  And when he was asked, why have you become a dictator?  He said, I've become a dictator, that there may be no other dictator in Turkey.  But that Turkey should rise up from the morass of poverty.  And today, when you go to your supermarkets, you get things called ramptons.  They even have Turkish schools in Africa.  That is Turkey built and midwifed by Atat\u00fcrk.  Leadership is the solution.  We are quick to point out Singapore.  When Singapore was being forced out of their union with Malaysia, many an obituary was written about Singapore.  It was said of Singapore that it would go nowhere, this backwater city-state.  But live when you recognize that when you muster your people and lead them into some direction, then they will realize their potential.  Today, Singapore has a per capita income of nearly 35,000 United States dollars, and it is properly distributed.  It is properly distributed.  But the problem of Africa, if you allow me to digress a little, is that the per capita income in Africa doesn't begin to tell the story.  The GDP of Africa doesn't begin to tell the story.  Because one African leader or one African government minister owns more than his entire village.  And the tragedy is that that minister still goes to church on Sunday and says, Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.  Thy kingdom come, and thy will be done on earth.  And he is a thief of gigantic proportions, stealing on an industrial scale.  I'm submitting to us that the problem of Africa is one of leadership.  We have seen in Dubai, in the middle of a desert, each one of us who is a middle class here will have gone to Dubai or your dream is that you go to Dubai or Abu Dhabi or Doha in Qatar.  When you are leaving Vinhoc to go to Europe and other places, you will... Take Qatar airline, Etihad airline or the Emirates.  These little Arab countries that are the might.  Why are they doing so?  well?  Leadership.  It all falls on and rises on leadership.  It all falls and rises on leadership.  If you have bad leaders, you only attained independence the other day and it doesn't come as instant coffee, but you can borrow from countries such as Denmark.  Countries such as Norway, countries such as Finland, countries such as Sweden, countries such as Singapore, so that by the time you are talking about your vision 2030, Namibia could actually have 80% employment.  It is achievable.  And with the discipline that I've seen here in Finnhock, where you obey traffic lights, where you have no garbage in your street, it is achievable because discipline is part of the solution.  You can achieve it.  But Namibia is an exception to the rule.  But that is not to say that many things cannot happen.  Many things can happen.  I'm still talking about resources.  Look at the Democratic Republic of Congo.  Each one of us here has a mobile phone.  And in each one of those mobile phones there is rare earths from the Democratic Republic of Congo.  It is said that in the rivers of Congo we can generate enough power to light the entire Africa.  The Democratic Republic of Congo has cobalt and gold and everything, and yet the Democratic Republic of Congo could not hold their elections last year because they have no money to hold elections.  Even Somalia, after 18 years of trouble, could hold an election.  The Democratic Republic of Congo cannot hold an election.  I'm a Kingo.  Yes, I'm a Kingo.  I think I'm a king, girl, a king. ",
