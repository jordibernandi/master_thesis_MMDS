            "text": "Alright, we're back.  So, we've already had our lesson in effective speech from the undisputed master of effective speaking, Carl Baugh.  And what a gift that was, but now we're gonna see how Carl applies that lesson on the cosmological scale.  I actually have no idea what that even means, cause his rules were about how to effectively communicate your ideas to other people.  It doesn't have a scale, cosmological or not, it's just basic interpersonal communication.  I guess you could say the scale of your speech increases if you yell really loud or broadcast it, but that's more about the reach of your speech, not the effectiveness of it.  The guidelines he proposed were about how to express yourself in a way that resonates with people, not about how to span the most distance.  Otherwise one of the rules would be, like, use a megaphone or upload to YouTube.  Enough recap, though.  Let's see if we can decipher what he's trying to say through his absurdly ineffective way of speaking. ",

When you say speech, do you mean the thing that I'm doing right now, moving my mouth to make sounds that you hear, that you interpret to understand what I'm saying to you?  Or even in a more general sense, just communication of ideas.  I mean, sign language, text, whatever, I'll accept all of that.  If what you're talking about is the heavens literally coming up with thoughts and trying to communicate them to people, then maybe we're talking about something more or less akin to what I'd recognize as speech.

Effective speech has for its ultimate end the winning of response.  Meaning that people are going to think about what you said and possibly even literally reply to you, right?  It's effective speech because it makes people go, hmm, that's a really good way to put that.  I've never heard it like that before.  But now you're saying that it affects the planet.  So what's going on here?  Are the angels, like, putting on a TED talk for planet Earth?  And planet Earth goes, what a compelling speech.  That changes everything about the way I think.  Point being, what are we talking about here, Carl?  It's the same problem I had in the previous video.  Are we talking about speech as being effective because it's compelling and convincing to people?  You know, it's phrased well and it makes them think?  Or are we talking about speech that's effective because it somehow does magic?  These are not the same thing.  Please don't conflate them. ",

So if the point of this video is, look how effective God's speech is, he can create a whole universe using it, why did you start us off talking about this other thing which is effectively putting your ideas into words?  I've always been a little bit curious how the production process of your TV show went, because it always feels like you're just winging it, like it feels like there's no planning, you have no interest in just taking a day, sitting down with your team and making sure it's cohesive, making sure that one thing follows from the next in some way.  Honestly, I get the impression the way this show always worked was that you just walked out in front of the plants and over to a board that's covered in pictures that one of your interns took out of the closet, totally at random, and you just start talking and hope you can tie them.
