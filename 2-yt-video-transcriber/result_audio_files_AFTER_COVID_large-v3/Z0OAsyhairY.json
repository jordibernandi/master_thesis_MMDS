            "text": "Hey guys, welcome to the Liberal Hive Mind, a channel solely focused on exposing the abundant hypocrisy of the left, the unconstitutional Democrats.  It's just a fact at this point that they disregard and disrespect the Constitution at every point in turn in their quest for absolute reigning power over the country and the American electorate.  That is the Democrat playbook.  If they can't win fair and square, They're going to change the rules.  And we've seen their attempts to do it basically since Hillary lost the election.  They have yet to get over the fact that they lost in 2016 to Donald Trump.  But what we're experiencing right now has to be the most egregious and unconstitutionally absurd plan of attack that the Democrats are enacting.  They want to pack the court.  They want to end the filibuster.  They want to make D.C.  and Puerto Rico states.  They want absolute supreme power.  They're not answering the question, but their lack of answer, in my opinion, answers the question.  They want to back the court, and many Democrats are even admitting it at this point.  Maybe not Joe and Harris, but the rest of the party is getting ready.  Chuck Schumer said it, nothing is off the table.  But get this, even CNN, or at least one guy on CNN, Jake Tapper, is holding them down.  to task, absolutely excoriating Kate Bedingfield, the Biden campaign communications director, on the issue, schooling her on what the constitution means.  The Democrats love to use the word.  Trump is unconstitutional, constitution this, constitution that, but it's all a distraction from the fact that they are the unconstitutional Dems.  So I gotta show you guys this little scenario with Jake Tapper.  It'll be short, it'll be quick, we'll cut up just the most important parts, and then I gotta show you guys exactly where the Democrats are.  We gotta talk about this, and frankly, we just gotta call out the Democrat Party right now for their crony political ways.

Now with that out of the way, Let's roll the tape.  All right, so let's set the baseline.  Let's watch CNN's Jake Tapper absolutely hand it to Joe Biden's communications director.  And you know what?  Before we play that clip, keep that title in mind.  Joe Biden's campaign communications director.  Notice how the way she's answering the question and communicating her point is basically exactly what's being said by the candidates themselves and disseminated by the campaign as a whole. ",

            "text": "And so there you have it.  Jake Tapper, I can't believe I'm saying this, is completely spot on the money.  Democrats.  don't understand what the Constitution is.  They see one poll from YouGov and think that's what the American people want.  But these polls don't represent the Constitution.  They don't represent the American electorate.  Not to mention, in a ton of them, Democrats are oversampled.  You might notice this in a lot of polls that show Joe Biden up by like 9 or 10 points.  There'll be 37% Democrats sampled and then like 31 or 32% Republican.  A 5% differential.  This is a trend I've noticed across hundreds of different polls.  I'm not even kidding.  And look at this.  Here's the YouGov poll for whether or not the Senate should confirm Amy Coney Barrett.  Notice how independents are flat 45-45.  So they're at a 50-50 split.  Theoretically, of course, not exactly 50-50, but you get what I mean.  If we take out the 10% who don't know, it's pretty much 50-50.  It shouldn't skew the numbers either way.  If we look at Democrats, 79% believe no and 16% believe yes.  If we look at Republicans, 86% believe yes and 8% believe no.  So just based off of those numbers, the majority should be yes that Amy Coney Barrett should be confirmed by the Senate.  But then if we look at the total tally, 48% say no and 45% say yes.  How do those numbers make sense?  They always... only make sense if more Democrats are being sampled.  This is how these pollsters skew the results.  And then Joe Biden's communication director can go on CNN and use these polls as a means to counter the Constitution.  But as far as I'm concerned, they have no argument.  Their argument is, give me my chicken tendies, I want my chicken tendies now.  You don't get to take the president's constitutional powers away because you don't like who he's going to nominate.  That is ridiculous.  The rules are the rules and the president has his right to nominate a SCOTUS pig.  And when Joe Biden comes out and says the Republicans are packing the court now, that is complete BS.  No, they're not.  The Senate is Republican, the presidency is Republican, and the American people's mandate lasts for four years, not three.  It's a very simple concept.  And they're total hypocrites.  Democrats only like the rules when it benefits them.  If they were in the president's position right now, and the GOP was trying to do the same thing to them, if the Democrats controlled the Senate, do you think that they would be coming up with these same talking points?  No, absolutely not.  And speaking of talking points, they're pretty much all pushing on these arguments.  Coons comes out and says, confirming Barrett constitutes court packing.  Don't you notice how Democrats are drones?  You know, the word that I mentioned earlier, disseminate, is really the key here.  Democrat media, Democrat pundits, talking heads, Democrat operatives, senators, representatives, they all get their talking point and say the exact same thing across the media sphere.  It happens every single time.  There's entire montages of them saying the exact same thing over and over again.  And some Democrats are even going as far as to say that court packing push is the reality.  Check this out. ",

And the reason he's answering the question the way that he is, is because that's how his puppet masters have guided him.  If he says that he wants to pack the Supreme Court, moderates, independents are going to reject him.  If he says that he doesn't want to pack the Supreme Court, then the far left is going to reject him.  So instead, they do what they always do.  Hillary Clinton's famous quote, a public and private policy.  Joe Biden will either say something or refuse to say something in public, but behind the scenes you know what they're working towards.  They're working towards rigging the electoral system for decades to come and indefinite Democrat leadership within the halls of Washington.  They are trying to drown out the quote, as they view it, flyover states.  As I view it, the backbone of America.  They want to stack the Supreme Court and end the historic legacy of the American political structure so Throw off the balance of the separation of power.  And what's even worse about it is they want you to elect them into office without even admitting it.  I guarantee you most Americans are not in favor for this.  Maybe in California they are.  But across the nation, independents don't want this.  But like Joe Biden said, you don't deserve to know.  And they don't care whether you want it or not.  They only care about rigging the system.  We've seen it on countless occasions.  The way.  they want to change the rules when it comes to elections.  They want to abolish the electoral system and have the outcome of every election decided by New York and California.  They want to stack the Supreme Court with liberal activist judges and stack the Senate with partisan actors for the Democrat Party.  They want to drown out your voice.  and become the supreme leaders of the United States of America.  It is a blatant, unconstitutional power grab and outside of all the Joe Biden gaffes and all of the, frankly, garbage policies, and of course the factor of Kamala Harris, the most important reason to not vote Joe Biden is due to his refusal to answer this very, very important, pertinent, and simple question.  such a blatant disrespect to the American electorate, to want to stack the system against half of the country and not even be transparent with where they stand on the issue.
