Not only a flatter of crayon muncher, But a Karen, of epic proportions.  This video will be a little bit different from the normal Flurf nonsense if we cover a meltdown from inside a Goodwill shop over wearing a mask during a global pandemic instead of someone denying gravity and saying, it's flat, bro.  But trust me, there's just as much stupid.  Welcome to episode 47 of Flurfs are Idiots.  We're living on a disk, floating through space with a tiny sun.  I'm a flat on.  Thank you for joining me once again as we look at the reason why aliens won't talk to us.  Stupid people.  And boy, is right the hand stupid.  So stupid, in fact, that he once made the claim that because 99% of men would beat 99% of women in a fight, it is irresponsible to teach a woman self-defense and said that even a pro female MMA fighter versus him would be 80% to 20% in his favor.  Pro female MMA star Tara LaRosa heard about what he said.  Before we start, shall we see how that meeting went?  You should, you should.  Hi.  Aww.  Aww.  I love you.  I could watch that all day.  I've created a timestamp that goes to the beginning of that and put it in the description so you can watch it over and over and over.  Feel free to spread the link to any Discord server that Left The Foot hangs out in.  Okay, let's have a look at his freakout in a Goodwill store of all places.  Facepalm warnings, some extra special stupid is coming your way. ",

I won't tell somebody to wear a seatbelt unless they are in my car because in a situation like that I am directly responsible for their safety and I could also get a ticket.
