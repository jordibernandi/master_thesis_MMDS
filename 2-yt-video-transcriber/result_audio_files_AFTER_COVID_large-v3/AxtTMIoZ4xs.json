            "text": "Basically, I've been thinking a lot about this.  Here we go.  This is a great piece.  I should say, friend of show, Cedric Michael Simmons, I'm black and I'm afraid of white fragility.  Although she had little medical training, Thanos founder Elizabeth Holmes claimed that she invented a foolproof way.  Theranos.  Theranos, excuse me.  Oh, Thanos.  Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes claimed she invented a foolproof way to test blood using a single drop.  Drawing on her connections to wealthy and powerful, Holmes was able to raise millions of dollars and track a lot of media hype.  Quote, Holmes isn't the only charlatan peddling cures.  Enter diversity trainer and education scholar Robert DiAngelo.  who's offering a simplistic remedy to racism via her book, White Fragility, Why It's So Hard to Talk to White People About Racism.  And he goes on to talk about how, you know, the book is number one in the New York Times bestseller list.  She was just on Jimmy Fallon.  This is the pop culture answer at the moment.  Can we just scroll down a little bit more?  There was a few more things I wanted to read before we launch into this.  What becomes clear getting past the introduction of white fragility is really an expression of D'Angelo's own guilt and fear about her contradictory role as a Euro-American racial dialogue manager.  She gets paid to be an expert on race and racism, despite the fact that she believes that white folks can never be an expert on race and racism.  Regardless of why D'Angelo wrote the book, our goal is to address racism and inequality in ways that serve the interests of poor and working people.  There are many reasons to be worried about white fragility's popularity.  To begin with, D'Angelo views racism as a problem to be combated with sensitivity training.  The premise of diversity and cultural competency training is that by educating European Americans on the consequences, on the persistence and consequences of Americans, consequences of racism, they can be transferred into non-racist or ideally anti-racist individuals, but diversity training has been largely shown to has been shown to be largely ineffective way of addressing racism in the workplace.  and he clicks on an article open it later that shows i mean this has been actually academically studied and the results as should be obvious are not that deep.  these lectures and workshops do little in the way of addressing the keep going the structural tensions that workers navigate on a daily basis.  As Frank Dobbs noted in his book, Inventing Equal Opportunity, such trainings often are merely a clever way of establishing legal protections for firms facing accusations of discrimination.  Now go on, and that these trainings can even reinforce bias.  All right, just there's a couple, there's a few other things that I want to read here.  Such a great piece.  Yeah, just, there's an essential problem at play here.  White fragility actually reinforces racist beliefs.  Sociologists generally root the notion that ethnicity can refer to an individual identity that individual communities assert, but races are labels that are ascribed to individuals.  Scholars such as Barbara E. Fields and Adolph Reed Jr.  And amusingly, D'Angelo's fellow traveler, Ibram Kendi, have repeatedly noted that racist beliefs and practices assume and reify the belief that nature produced different types of human beings with unique inborn attributes.  D'Angelo doesn't talk about, quote unquote, supposed racial differences in scholar intellectual capacity, but the book is filled with associations of race with physiological differences.  Anyways, and he goes on to basically say, if I'm a corporation, I don't want the conversation about my policies and how things are distributed.  I want the conversation about you as an employee.  And just as we were talking about with Joanna Viest, even, you know, great, like, as long as there's at-will employment in this country, you can be fired if you can hide the tracks because of your identity.  That's the bottom line.  Unite here is organizing at Starbucks right now because it cannot be legally proven.  And Starbucks loves to show itself as being socially progressive.  They say inside the company, I completely believe them, of course, that there's discriminatory practices against black employees and trans employees.  And so what we have right now is this enormous phenomenal uprising about racism, about brutality, about policing.  And it is getting funneled into an anemic democratic party policy response along with embarrassing cultural gestures, a massive boom in the corporate training circuit.  And which is, I mean, it's despicable.  I mean, the amount of money that D'Angelo is getting paid to do these things and plenty like her could be used to literally being saving people's jobs and Yeah.  Like actual things.  Like it's only enforcing wealth inequality.  And now, and of course a new way, and then embarrassing dumb shit, like taking off TV shows or whatever, ending satire.  And then another wave of people being disgusting, toxic, moralistic to each other on social media.  This, these are, I mean, how to see how these things, it's not just that they're wrong.  and they don't address the vital issues that the uprisings are pointing to.  They are a function of the same predator system that produced all these problems to begin with.  If you're on Twitter being an asshole and canceling and all this trash, not only are you just, that sucks, but you are feeding the algorithm.  You're there, you're serving the function of these companies.  That's what you're doing.  And this whole exporting that somehow people uprising against murder and everything associated with it in terms of race and class and power structure in this country has been funneled into the corporate training racket.  It, it, you really need to see how these things function.  You need to see that McDonald's is going to put out talking about amplifying black voices.  and it's not just, see, there's two big misinterpretations of it.  There's people on the right, they go, see, You're just part of the mainstream.  These uprisings aren't real bullshit because none of this stuff is about what was centered in those uprisings.  But then there's a lot of people on the left that just say like, oh, no, that doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter.  It's not what the protests about, not what the protests about.  Well, as Bill Fletcher Jr.  said, those who have power get to determine what demands are about.  And this several weeks in is what we're getting manifested.  a new wave of toxic social practices and absolute bullshit trainings that just even on an intellectual and, and, you know, personal level, like the fact that people aren't figuring out how to read Cabral or Malcolm X or, you know, or the field sisters.  I mean, it's, it's, it's even, even taken in its own terms, it's actually quite disgusting. ",
