            "text": "My main issue was that Paul and Morgan made what was essentially an anti-birth control video and the following week made an ill informed anti-choice video.  From my perspective, these videos were important to refute because family planning is a huge deal.  When Christians spread misinformation and shame around the issue of reproduction, it can result in what some women consider the most painful decision of their lives.  Over 70% of termination clients identified as Christian at that time.  Side note, I'm going to avoid the A word because YouTube demonetizes creators for using certain language.  I wish I didn't have to censor myself, but that is the state of sex ed on YouTube as of right now.  Anyway, people often accuse me of being pro-termination, but in reality, it is my heart and passion to prevent terminations.  When people are given fact-based, comprehensive sex education and access to birth control, termination rates drop drastically.  Also, the more I've grown in my understanding of intimacy and spirituality, I really have begun to see lovemaking as an act of worship.  It is literally procreative in that a baby can arrive, but it also creates deeper love, intimacy, and connection.  If you think about it, when the church calls birth control immoral, it actually risks turning lovemaking into an elitist pleasure.  This idea implies that Kim Kardashian and Kanye West can go off and have all the sex that they want because they have the financial provision to raise tons of children.  Whereas I, in my one bedroom apartment, would have to abstain from lovemaking much more frequently because I can't afford baby after baby after baby.  And yes, I know natural family planning is a great option, but if you are in a situation where having a baby would put you into poverty or cause a dire situation, another birth control option, though not foolproof, could make you more confident to enjoy that intimacy with your lover.  And we can get into all of this more deeply because this week I'm going to respond to Catholic YouTuber Lizzie Answers response to my response video.  But next week, her and I are going to have a one-on-one conversation.  I'm sure you all know how excited I am about this because I consistently ask people of different points of view to please have a conversation with me and I get turned down almost every single time.  But Lizzie said yes.  Before we dive in, today on the God is Great podcast, I brought back our number one most downloaded guest, Jamie Lee Finch.  In our last conversation, we talked politics, hell, and how to heal from religious trauma.  In this episode, we'll be discussing permission and agency.  In other words, when you've decided it is high time to heal from purity culture, from religious trauma, Jamie and I will walk you through the steps you can take to regain that personal autonomy and enjoy sex the way God intended it to be.  So search the God is Great podcast on Apple, Google, Spotify, and more.  Now back to Lizzie Answers.  Lizzie first called me out on being less than charitable in my approach towards Paul and Morgan.

After getting pregnant, I realized to my horror that my insurance policy required that I pay a minimum of $6,000 plus 40% of all services up to $120,000.  My checkups, my birth itself, were about to put me into some very serious debt.  Lizzie's solution to this takes the weight off the woman alone. ",

But if my partner goes into debt over our baby's birth, we are swimming in that debt together.  Story's not over.  Thank God I qualified for aid, and the baby's birth was covered.  However, almost immediately after Valentine was born, I disqualified for that aid, which meant I wouldn't be able to attend my follow-up appointments.  This means after I pushed out a baby, when I could barely walk, when I was bleeding profusely every single day, our system is set up so that my body, my health, became irrelevant as soon as I had the baby.  All politics aside, that is effed up.  And if you think women aren't weighing that reality when choosing whether or not to have a baby, you are wrong.  And if you're upset about government aid, if you believe people in need are lazy and unmotivated and just out to bleed our government dry, then consider my former insurance policy.  I worked like crazy, chose a policy I could afford, and was still liable for up to $120,000.  The stark reality is that a lot of people choose termination due to our failed healthcare system.  Until American healthcare is fixed, having a baby can be financially devastating.  Which brings us to another great point of Lizzie's.  Did those in poverty not pray hard enough?  If your child can't afford the school lunch, is it because you didn't believe in God's provision? ",

I will humbly admit that is a sad and pretty weird way of looking at having children.  But again, the reason I made that comparison is because I've heard the stories of women.  Even though babies themselves are epic and wonderful, if you're financially vulnerable, if you have an abusive partner, if you're a victim of assault, becoming pregnant can feel that dire.  I advocate for pregnancy prevention because I don't want people to suffer.  And I'd prop up abstinence as the go-to because yes, that is the only way to 100% prevent pregnancy unless you're Jesus' mom.  Statistically speaking, it is not a reality that people, even Christians, will abstain from sex.  Therefore, I do get upset when religious people call birth control outright immoral.

In my life, sexual ethics are not about lists of rules or even saving sex for marriage.  But in my process of honoring sex, as my sexual ethic grew, my dating life reflected that.  but they would be the kind of man to realize if I have sex, pregnancy is a possibility that they would be of a high enough caliber that they would take care of that child.  I can't wait to learn more from Lizzie about Catholicism because I'm in the dark on a lot of it, but I do know that they are against birth control.  Their belief is that sex is inherently procreative and therefore when we engage in sex, we should always be open to creating life.

And if you are in financial or relational turmoil, natural family planning or leaving it up to God, may not be suitable for you.  You may need to take extra precautions to make sure your finances and your family are safe.  And please watch my video on this because I do detail side effects and complications of birth control.  But again, my whole mission is to empower the God is Great community to make decisions from their own prayer life and to lean into education.  Education is empowering.  It empowers you to make wise decisions with your body, with your sexuality, with your health.  Because truly, the less terminations that people suffer, the happier I will be.  And that's it.  Lizzie's gonna watch this video, and then we're gonna talk it all out for you next week.  If anyone has any thoughts, questions, rebuttals, whatever, leave it kindly in the comment section.  Let's get some conversation going.  I will read all of those comments, and Lizzie and I will try to address them in next week's video.  Please like, subscribe, share with your friends, donate to my Patreon or Venmo if you can.  I love you all.  God bless. ",
