            "text": "Why hello my fellow apes, I hope you're well.  Until now I haven't publicly expressed a comprehensive account of what I consider religion to be, and more importantly, why it exists, but I have made commentary here and there that fits the view of religion being merely a social construct, created to control the masses and provide hope and order in a chaotic world.  There's not a lot of data on just how many people hold this view, I mean, why would there be?  But judging by what little evidence we do have, this view is not only the most commonly held among the irreligious, but also the religious.  The Christian, for instance, tends to think of other religions as at best as a corruption of their own, and at worst as a social construct born of ideological ambition.  The same, of course, is true of the Muslim, Hindu, Shintoist, and so on.  Further still, this is the sociological view of religion.  Whilst Weber, Durkheim, and Marx differ in their extended views, they are united in regarding religion as an evolutionary adaption.  After all, the essence of a social species is social cohesion, and where ants use pheromones and chimpanzees groom, humans have ritual.  Thus, the sociologist is typically indifferent to supernatural claims.  It is of little consequence if Jesus resurrected, Muhammad split the moon, or Thor defeated the frost giants.  So long as the belief offers the tribe utility, it's done its job.  In a nutshell, my view of religion is a more reductionist take than the aforementioned, placing additional emphasis on the evolutionary roots, and it's fair to say that Carl Jung and Jordan Peterson have partially inspired my perspective.  Because of this, where many see delusion worthy of nothing more than disdain, I see potential treasure worthy of both disdain and respect.  What's more, I've found that the theory that I subscribe to simply makes better sense of religion, and, because it acknowledges the intuitions of adherents but rejects their interpretation, it offers a unique middle ground.  Anyhow, let's begin at a surface level and build up from there.  Life in the state of nature is solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.  These are the words that Thomas Hobbes used to describe our natural nomadic circumstances, and whilst we've escaped many of the binds of nature, one shackle will forever remain.  We suffer, and then we die.  Yes, if we're lucky, as the vast majority of us alive today are, we'll experience a lot of joy and happiness along the way, but no matter our path, all roads lead to the lonesome city of demise.  I'd argue that this is the most inconvenient truth of our existence.  As Christopher Hitchens put it, evolution has meant that our prefrontal lobes are too small and our adrenal glands too big, and thus our irrelevance in the universe is so inconvenient, so at odds with our ego, so at odds with our evolution even, that in the absence of courageous scepticism we are perfectly primed to embrace comforting lies.  It's this rather disgusting credulity that urged Twain to write that religion was invented when the first conman met the first fool.  To get at the heart of the matter, let's switch down a gear.  We deeply desire to be part of something far greater than ourselves, to know that we are at the very least a pawn in the cosmic game at play, and religion offers this promise in abundance.  You're not just an important part of the universe, no, you're the creator's favourite toy, the pinnacle of all creation.  Indeed, both Abrahamic and Eastern religions elevate us far above our mammalian kin, the former by God's will and the latter by transmigration.  In either case, you are special.  Yes, you might be suffering here on Earth, but smile, sweet child, and wipe away your tears, for this life is but a test for the next, in which you'll be unimaginably rewarded for your faith.  You'll be given all the riches of the most wildest dreams, and justice will be enacted on those that have wronged you.  They'll burn in sulphur or come back as a slug.  What more could you possibly hope for?  Yeah, it's a little suspiciously convenient, isn't it?  Further still, religion offers great psychological utility.  As the ex-Muslim Hassan Radwan puts it, Being part of a group that has billions of subscribers that share beliefs and experiences gives you a sense of identity, comfort, security, and community.  You don't feel you are struggling alone in a vast universe.  You can have hope that God will look after you.  Human lives are littered with tragedies that cannot be prevented nor predicted.  Religion provides a blanket to wrap oneself in when tragedy strikes.  It promises that you will be compensated in an afterlife.  Your life and sufferings, no matter how trivial, are seen, noted, and acknowledged.  Again, Twain's harsh words come to mind, but perhaps more fitting is the following from Marx.  Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions.  It is the opium of the people.  So religion offers social cohesion by establishing authority and quenching existential anxiety, but as said earlier, in certain circumstances it has imperative utility.  I'll now give just two examples. ",

            "text": "It's always irked me that we call Christianity religion and Norse mythology, mythology, when the only relevant difference is subscription.  And so, let's take the Norse religion and specifically its notion of Valhalla.  On the surface, Valhalla is a very strange belief \u2013 it's a form of heaven reserved for only half of warriors who fall in combat.  More still, it's regarded as the greatest privilege, the highest heaven, and yet, if it's true, none of us today will break bread with Odin, for none of us will perish in combat.  That is, unless we fabricate a PhD in Odinology, and sophisticatedly argue that death in combat is not to be taken literally as the New Age atheists like Sam Harris do, but rather it's to be taken as a metaphor.  I'm having a revelation.  Just as Yahweh told the Pope that limbo is no longer a thing, Odin's telling me that Valhalla is for the intelligent.  I mean, he gave his eye for wisdom, not for strength.  Those who dedicate their lives to intellectually fighting for the Aesir will find themselves at Odin's table, as they died in intellectual combat against the evil forces that be.  And what of Odin inspiring Ivar the Boneless to annihilate his enemies, I hear you ask?  Well, that was Odin just working in mysterious ways, you see, just as Yahweh was working in mysterious ways when he commanded through Moses to kill every male among the little ones and kill every woman who have known a man by lying with him, but all the women children who have not known a man by lying with him.  Keep alive for yourselves.  Seriously, how shallow and pedantic is the atheism of today?  I mean, how can they possibly dismiss Yggdrasil without reading all of the works of Neil Gaiman?  There are thousands of accounts of giants roaming all... Digression aside, let's get back on track.  It's all too easy for us, the children of the Enlightenment, basking in privilege never before seen, to dismiss Valhalla as a bizarre belief, a peculiar fabrication spawned of one too many magic mushrooms, and indeed our culture largely encourages us to think this, courtesy of chiefly Christianity.  but I would argue that the reason we see Valhalla as a bizarre belief is simply because we judge it from our perspective.  If, instead, we judge it by the environment in which it emerged, Valhalla is every bit as understandable as the Heaven of the West and the Samsara of the East.  In a state of nature in which clans slaughter one another for the little resources available, which is precisely the conditions that the Norse religion just stated within, the belief that you'll be greatly rewarded should you perish honourably in combat offers obvious utility.  If your clan fights harder than your adversary, your chances of victory significantly rise.  And remember, for the Norse, it wasn't enough to embrace death as a warrior, you must embrace death as a hero, for only half of the fallen will dine in the great halls.  Thus, Valhalla not only has literary, historical, and anthropological value, but in the conditions in which it emerged, it had extraordinary utility value.  It's a variation of the strong warrior archetype that's found in almost every religion, and especially those that emerged in similar states of privation.  I would go so far as to argue that unless or until we alter our genes, this motif will always have an alluring appeal, no matter how irrelevant it is to the challenges of modernity.  I'll delve into motifs in just a moment, but first, let me give another example of a religious practice that at surface level appears bizarre.  Consider the Vajrayana Buddhist funeral practice of sky burial, in which the corpses of loved ones are placed on mountaintops to be eaten by carrion birds.  The Vajrayana believe that once a person is dead their spirit leaves their body as part of the process of reincarnation, and that by gifting their empty vessel, their body, to other beings, the birds, they are nurturing their karma.  Like Valhalla, this seems utterly bizarre to our Starbucks generation, to the extent that the average Westerner coils in disgust.  But again, this is because we judge it by our own light.  If we consider the environment in which sky burials emerged, then the belief makes as much sense as any burial or cremation.  In the high altitudes of Tibet and Shanghai, the ground consists of solid rock and permafrost, making burial near impossible, and the lack of fuel and timber similarly renders cremation unviable.  Exposing a deceased to nature is simply the most practical and, many would argue, respectful solution to alleviating a corpse.  Given this, you might not be all that surprised to learn that evidence of similar funeral practice in the region dates back at least 11,500 years.  Religious beliefs are hence not just carrots swung to enforce obedience, but some, at least, are also abstract embodiments of the challenges and environments of those that conjured them.  We could, of course, apply this reductionist approach to any religious or superstitious belief, and when corroborated with adequate anthropological, historical, and psychological evidence, we can potentially discover crucial facts about not only the challenges of our ancestors, but more importantly, who we are as a species \u2013 and this is especially likely when the same archetypes, motifs, and symbols emerge independently in vastly different cultures.  We must, however, and I can't stress this enough, be very careful as to avoid confirmation bias and the naturalistic fallacy.  If we are looking to justify the utility of a belief, then by vice of our lowly origin, we're going to do so, even when it's not actually justifiable.  For this reason, we must insist on having additional evidence from strong scientific disciplines.  And in regards to the naturalistic fallacy, we can never infer that because something is natural it follows that it's morally correct, ethically justifiable, or even relevant to the environment of today.  Misogyny, to take just one example, goes hand in hand with religion.  Faith is most certainly man-made.  Masculine dominance has emerged independently in so many cultures and religions that I, for one, am convinced that this constitutes strong evidence of it being a viable strategy in the state of nature.  Indeed, studies have shown that primates with intergroup competition tend to select masculine leadership, whereas primates with intergroup competition tend to select for feminine leadership.  I'd say that misogyny is most certainly natural, but that obviously doesn't make it right.  Burying an axe in someone's skull because they're of a different clan is natural, but that's not very nice.  And this brings me to the major challenge that we've been facing for quite some time.  Our intuitions, archetypes, and motifs evolved in an environment scarcely similar to the world of today.  We are a fish out of water, and we need to deeply analyse our evolutionary psychology to recognise which bits are vestigial and which bits are for keeps.  But the problem with religion, needless to say, is that it's dogmatic.  It's horrendously resistant to this necessary flexibility.  Whereas the non-believer can accept the Abrahamic motif of the loving father but reject the bigotry and false assertions, the believer has a significantly harder time doing the same.  Some can make progress, of course, as is the case with most Christians finally accepting evolution, but others are incredibly stagnant, such as Islam, which boasts to be the final word from God.  Religion is hence the appendix of our psyche.  Where it once greatly improved our chances of survival, it now largely hinders it.  Or to put this another way, aggression over affection may have been the optimal solution in the state of nature, but when the axe is replaced with the nuclear bomb, the optimal solution is affection over aggression.  Misogyny may have been the optimal solution in the state of nature, which is embodied by nearly every religion, but when the challenges we face are of an intergroup nature, such as nuclear proliferation, climate change, globalized economy, and extraterrestrial travel, the optimal solution is affection over aggression.  Now, I could happily speak on this matter for hours on end, covering the emergence and decline of Greco-Roman polytheism, the Crusades, and various religious positions on sexuality, but I don't want this video to go on forever.  Before I wrap up, however, I can't resist talking about our archenemies, snakes.  The symbolism of snakes can be found in just about every religion, and even among those that emerged in ecosystems absent deadly snakes, such as Celtic Britain.  Britain has only one native venomous snake, the European adder, and it's not considered especially dangerous, as in this fine land more people die of bee stings than they do of adder bites.  nevertheless druids revered and feared snakes and used them in medical rituals because like certain plants and fungi which have healing properties.  venom has conscious altering effects.  ecologists such as dr lane isbel have argued that the reason that snakes can be found in just about every religion is because they were our first and most persistent predators.  They might not be our archenemy today, but they were for tens of millions of years.  They were such a threat, Isbell continues, that they heavily contributed to the emergence and evolution of primates.  Our forward-facing eyes and cognitive capacity to identify camouflaged objects is largely courtesy of snakes.  Now the adders of England may be easy prey for us, but the Black Mamba of Africa, which is, after all, where we're all descended, is exceptionally dangerous.  With just two drops in 20 minutes, untreated Black Mamba venom has a fatality rate of nearly 95%.  Now that sounds like an archenemy to me.  Thor, the Norse god of thunder, storm, and strength, certainly seems to agree, for his archenemy is J\u00f6rgenmand, the world serpent that's destined to initiate Ragnarok.  Weird, isn't it, that in the frozen lands of Norway, snakes, an ectothermic species, is considered the nemesis.  The Buddhists and Hindus also accept ray snakes, through the monstrosity of naga, a race of half-human, half-serpents who guard temples and treasures.  And they're not alone.  Snakes are often depicted as guardians because they tend to raise up and stand their ground.  They are natural guardians.  If there's a snake in the camp, so says the tribe leader, we're moving camp.  And to give just one more example, in the Abrahamic religions, the enemy of man, the devil, takes the form of a talking snake in the Garden of Eden.  Why a snake and not a bumblebee, or at least an alligator?  Most don't ask this question because they either believe it outright or they're sick to death of religion.  But given our evolution, it's no surprise that a primate depicts its historically greatest predator as its antagonist.  Anyhow, as previously said, I could go on for hours, but for now at least I've said enough.  It's 3am and I should probably get some sleep.  But, in conclusion, we evolved to survive in the brutish state of nature, in which resources were scarce and ignorance was king, but we now inhabit a world far beyond our ancestors' wildest dreams.  This has created a seemingly irreparable conflict between our intuitions and our reason, as the former is born of evolution and the latter is the emancipation from it.  We have simply not evolved to confront the challenges of modernity, and our outdated hardware threatens, ironically, to end us.  no doubt some of the motifs in religion will always be relevant such as the depiction of light as good and dark as bad and i'd bet that this motif permeates in any species that we would cite as a primary sense.  but many of the motifs in religion are not only irrelevant but extremely dangerous.  Anyhow, food for thought.  I need that sleep.  I'm Stephen Woodford.
