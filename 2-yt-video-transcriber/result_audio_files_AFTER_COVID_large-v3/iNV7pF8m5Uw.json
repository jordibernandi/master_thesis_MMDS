            "text": "Hi, perhaps you are viewing this video because you are in fact looking for a last minute gift.  Perhaps you also know someone to whom you would like to give that gift who is familiar with my work.  You might also be aware that I have a new book coming out on March 3rd, 2021, Beyond Order, 12 More Rules for Life.  Beyond Order can be pre-ordered at many booksellers.  You can find a list of them by country and corporation on my website, jordanbpeterson.com.  The more precise URL is listed in the video's description.  If you would like to pre-order this book as a gift, you can download and print out a one-page purchase announcement PDF indicating that you have done so.  That could be slid inside an envelope and delivered to the person to whom the pre-order delivery has been scheduled.  The PDF can be found at jordanbpeterson.com as well, and a more precise URL for that is also in the video description.  So, to recapitulate, you need to buy a gift.  You know someone interested in my work.  You pre-order the book from a bookseller listed on my website and have it delivered as a gift.  You print out the purchase announcement on my website and send it to the gift's eventual recipient.  Here is a one-paragraph selection from Beyond Order.  This is from the first chapter, Rule 1.  Do not casually denigrate social institutions or creative achievement.  It's from a section called The Utility of the Fool.  It is useful to take your place at the bottom of a hierarchy.  It can aid in the development of gratitude and humility.  Gratitude There are people whose expertise exceeds your own and you should be wisely pleased about that.  There are many valuable niches to fill given the many complex and serious problems that we must solve.  The fact that there are people who fill those niches with trustworthy skill and experience is something for which to be truly thankful.  Humility It is better to presume ignorance and invite learning than to assume sufficient knowledge and risk the consequent blindness.  It is much better to make friends with what you do not know than with what you know, because there is an infinite supply of the former, but an all too finite stock of the latter.  When you are tightly boxed in or cornered all too often by your own stubborn and fixed adherence to some unconsciously worshipped assumptions, all there is to help you is what you have not yet learned.  So, that's a sample paragraph from Beyond Order, which can be pre-ordered now from the booksellers on my website, and if you like, given as a gift.  Thank you.  Happy holidays. ",
