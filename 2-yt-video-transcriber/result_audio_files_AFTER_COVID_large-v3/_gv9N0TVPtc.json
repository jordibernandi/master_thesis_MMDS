Hey, guys.  Surprise city court.  Ran us out.  They've got something to hide.  They clearly have something to hide in the Surprise City Court.  We all know these judges retain the bench when they run unopposed in their scam elections.  Okay, so it looks like we have some sort of special entrance right here.  This guy right here is a tyrant.  You can see they got their tight little funnel spot there with their metal detector.  Most of those metal detectors are nothing more than a funnel.  the funnel everybody through.  that's why they use the metal wand.  after that's why they use a metal wand.  after the fact because those metal detectors body scanners just aren't very sensitive they won't pick up most metals.  it's just a deterrent.  how are we doing?  don't video me.  what are you doing?  don't video you?  no I don't video you.  are you security?  yeah so what are you doing?  taking some pictures.  why?  Because I can, I'm on a public sidewalk.  Can you please back up from me?  Well, can you please put your camera down?  Well, don't walk in front of my camera and it won't be in your face.  But why are you doing this?  Walk away from me if you don't want to be on camera.  Have you ever thought of that?  But why are you doing that?  I notice you're covering your badge up.  You got something to hide, ma'am?  No, you're just... I'm guessing you've got something to hide.  You have a good day, ma'am.  Thank you.  Okay, we found some tyrants guys.  Didn't take long. ",

They asked me, I left.  That's why I'm outside right now.  You won't see me back in there.  Okay.  You're free to go.  Thanks.  I'm free to stay.  Okay.  Let's see what we're dealing with out here in Surprise, Arizona.  First Amendment protected activity.  You get surrounded by three hired guns.  Is that not considered public space in there?  No, it's a city building.  Just inside this area is public area as long as you don't go past the metal detectors.  Typically that's public area, but I'm staying out of there because he asked me to.  I'm not looking for any troubles here.  Okay guys, look at this.  They definitely have something to hide in there at the Surprise City Court.  They clearly have something to hide.  So, all you Arizona auditors out there, remember this.  The Surprise City Court Needs more attention.  Here comes the stripes.  Here comes the sergeant.  See the three stripes.  Okay, you just heard him.  He's saying we're a constitutionalist.  Anybody with a camera is a threat to police and public safety apparently.  because they have something to hide. ",
