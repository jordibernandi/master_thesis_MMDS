            "text": "This is part three to.  Oh, What a Beautiful Morning.  And the thing I wanted to start off with right now is to talk about the climate change.  And whenever we talk about the currency, sorry, whenever we talk about global warming, that's That's not happening.  What's happening is that we're about to enter another ice age because the distance from the sun is such that we've already gotten to the closest part of our orbit around the sun and we're now going to be.  there are different climate cycles.  one is every 7,000 years or so and then there's also every 60,000 years and we're.  What happens with the mini ice ages, which is every 7,000 years, is that when it gets to be very cold, that's when the, I say the network of global corporate control, these are actually the families that were there during the Crusades.  What they do is they They migrate so that the crops are there.  They're not going to be destabilized.  They use the... the Ice Ages to disrupt the business and the trade.  That's my dog again.  Sorry about that.  Joshua just cut it out.  Anyway, so they've been doing this for a long time.  And where we are on the climate is that if we don't realize what's actually going on, then we're going to be starving because the agriculture is going to be affected and the groups that capitalize on the changes in climate to disrupt trade, they're going to win again.  now that we know, we can start to prepare ourselves and to store the food that we need so that we're not going to be disrupted.  The other thing that I think is important to mention about the climate is The physicists, they understand that the sun is actually electromagnetic.  One of the scientists that's been trying to publish this information, he's the spouse of a very close friend of mine.  The people in DARPA are trying to prevent him from publishing this.  And finally, his family is going to take dictation so that he can publish this.  And of course, they're being hindered every which way from these bankers, and some of them don't even realize the weaponry that's involved.  But many of us do.  And so I would expect that as we transition to a kinder world, we're also going to go back and we're going to set the record straight and we're going to understand that our science is not, the universities and their tenure system, it's actually designed to keep us stupid.  And as I've also mentioned, the legal and accounting professions, they're there to help steal the money.  And not every single lawyer is a crook, but their legal systems don't explain to them that we have something called maritime law.  And it's the bankers who've been using this maritime law to... to make all the courts corrupt and the judges that are in the courts, they've been trained legally to be stupid and not to understand what's going on.  And some of the lawyers that actually did understand what was going on, like Anton Scalia, they get murdered.  Now, how is it that I'm not murdered?  Well, let me explain to you that I'm being protected a lot and I've been harmed.  But I'm rather stubborn and cantankerous, and it doesn't stop me in my tracks.  I just do whatever I can to keep going.  And so what happened with the last video, after I was slammed to the ground to try to prevent me from doing the video, is I just sort of limped, and I did it very slowly and very deliberately, things are not happening the way I want them to happen.  I'll just do the best I can to make them happen whichever which way I can.  And I'm being supported by friends and other people that are.  They're helping me because as I've mentioned to you, we're all in this together.  One of the other things that you'll see on the outline that I wanted to talk to you about is I wanted to talk to you about the number 666, because some people, you know, that's the number of the trust that has all the world's wealth.  It's TVMLSM666.  And TVM is Tiburcio Villarro Marcos, that's the initials of Marcos' son.  And LSM is Leo Marcos.  They were two of Marcos' sons.  And 666, well, people have looked at the number 666 and they think that that's somehow connected with Satan.  But don't forget also that the Bible was written after this corrupt group came into power.  That's Joshua again.  Sorry about that.  So let me explain to you what 666 actually is.  That means humanity.  That's the number of electrons that are circulating in carbon, which is the number that means humanity.  And for the people that wrote the Bible, which came after 666, after this corrupt group grabbed power, they were trying to confuse us, obviously.  Now, I don't want to get involved in the topic of religion, because that's a very contentious topic, and we can be distracted, and then the group that's responsible for this corruption likes to use... likes to use divide and conquer.  And so we're going to deal with spirituality and religion, but we're going to do that in a sequence so that we've gotten rid of the corrupt money first and the corruption, and then we can deal with our spirituality differently.  And I'm not saying that this is not important.  And just so people understand that.  I'm also not saying that the Bible is bad.  I'm saying that there are things that were put in the Bible to mislead us deliberately so that we would get... we would get off track.  And one of the other topics that seems to keep on coming up is whether I'm Jewish and whether that means that I'm a Zionist and what that all means.  And so let me just tell you that I'm.  I've been, as a child, I was raised in a Jewish household.  But then in my early 20s, I went on this spiritual trip and I saw Jesus Christ sitting on the throne.  That really, that impressed me, to put it mildly.  And so after I graduated from law school and I went to live in New York, I went across the street to a Lutheran church and I was baptized.  And then I sang in the choir for 10 years.  And because I love Bach, that's probably one of the reasons that I ended up where I did.  But after that, I just kept on developing, and I wasn't going to let people tell me how I was going to be spiritual, and that included the clergy.  I was very happy to learn a lot of things from the clergy, but I wasn't going to be limited by those things either, or bound by them.  So my job is not to be partial to spirituality and certainly not to be limited by it and certainly not to get into a fight over it.  So that's what I wanted to say when I was talking about 666.  And there's one other thing that came up that I wanted to stress, and that's the different ways that we're being asked to fight each other for bad reasons.  Racism, that's something that's.  It's something that comes from our very rudimentary, primitive part of our brains because the very first part of the brain is the reptilian part.  That's the one that cares about hierarchy.  And that's the one that's got built in racism.  But that's not our whole brain.  That's just the very rudimentary part of the brain.  And so what happens when you're dealing with the rudimentary part of the brain is that yes you you'll be racist but you have to rise above that and you shouldn't be racist.  you have to use your critical reasoning capabilities and empathy and human love not to be racist but um also when you when you realize the things that divide us.  let's talk about the gender issues And the bankers were trying to get women and men to hate each other.  Now, this is a losing proposition, obviously.  But let's not talk about our differences.  Let's talk about how we overcome those differences and how we're empathetic and how we want to function in our new beautiful reality which contains the wealth of the world and the people that are alive today.  it's a very.  it's a very meaningful thing.  we're not alive for no good reason.  this is a very important transitional moment and we're also all responsible for caring for each other and for coming up with a peaceful transition.  And I wasn't going to talk about reincarnation because, first of all, I don't have the final word on that in any event.  But I will mention to you something that I was talking about with somebody else who's part of the critical mass.  Some of us are able to communicate with people who have died.  I had that experience when I was active with the swim team and one of the girls who was a lifeguard at that community pool was in a freak kayak accident and she died.  suddenly, unexpectedly.  And at that moment I felt that I was in contact with her and that she was very unhappy to be dead.  And then Maybe three or four months after that, she was reconciled to the fact.  I knew her mother not that well, but since we were part of that community pool, I did have contact with her.  I couldn't really tell her what I knew that her daughter had told me because she wasn't open to that.  But anyway, so I was talking to one of the other people in the critical mass and she told me also that she's received messages from the other side.  Now I haven't received a lot of those messages.  There are people who can do that very clearly and I'm obviously not that good at it.  But I do know that We as spiritual beings are much more than we own up to.  And if you have an immortal soul, that means something.  So we have to.  We have to live up to our capabilities.  And when I say live up to, that means that we have to overcome our differences, which we have, but there's no reason to fight about them.  As they say in French, vive la diff\u00e9rence.  Well, I'm not going to drone on and on.  I think this is a very good time to end.  And I'm... One other thing I want to say is I'm looking forward to getting your feedback and we're just going to take it from here.  We're going to continue to communicate and we do have a relationship and hopefully we also have relationships with others and we're all going to sort ourselves out in a peaceful way.  Oh, what a beautiful morning.  You can see in many ways the evidence that I'm fencing with the black nobility.  My posts get removed.  The falsified counters are two examples.  Still, I can carry on.  This is because I get a lot of help. ",
