Spencer Smith did a video on this a couple of days ago, but if you don't follow Spencer, you may not have seen this yet.  At the 2020 Southwest Believers Convention, Kenneth Copeland gives a demonstration in understanding covenant.  They start off by mixing salt in a bag to demonstrate that when you mix two people's salt, it's impossible to know which is which or to separate them.  And then it gets just creepy. ",

Now at the communion table, he said, this is my blood of the new covenant.  All of you drink all of it.  Judas had to drink that.  So, and I want you to be this way every time you take communion and you ought to take it a lot, a lot.  Now his blood is in my body.  It's in there.  His blood is mixed with my blood.  Can you see it?  We've been, Western people don't know anything about covenant.  Eastern people do. ",

            "text": "So this is just a really strange way to explain this.  It resembles something more New Age than biblical.  Jesus' blood covenant was for the remission of sins because the blood of goats and bulls could never fully do this.  This new covenant was God's promise that when someone believed or committed to Jesus that our sins would be remitted or canceled and we would be born again as a new creation through Christ.  But as usual, Kenneth makes this just weird. ",
