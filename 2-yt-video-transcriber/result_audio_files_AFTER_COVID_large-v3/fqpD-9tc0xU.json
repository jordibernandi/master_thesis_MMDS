Rejected from the military for mental instability and petty crime, he ekes out a dismal existence.  Ronnie's only world is the one he makes online on his computer.  After creating a vlog channel on the downfall of real America, he derails from his video platform against those he perceives as enemies.  As Ronnie gains confidence from the online extremist community, his channel grows.  Meanwhile, sexual frustration leads him to a local swinger couple who pay him to play cuckold in their homemade amateur pornography.  Unaware that they are exploiting him, he accepts the role and its rewards.  Ronnie buys an unregistered handgun and strokes his ego at firing ranges.  he meets his online idol, a charismatic leader of the alt-right.  However, when his identity as cuck emerges, his macho persona shatters.  Facing online shaming, Ronnie takes solace in the one symbol of masculinity.  he has left.  He's gone.  It's literally about a dude trying to join the all right because he was radicalized on YouTube.  Wow.  I'm not surprised.  nobody saw it.  Nobody cared because that sounds like garbage. ",
