            "text": "Look at this guy.  He saw some black people on the stairs.  What's up, black people?  What you doing over here on the stairs?  Illegal.  Oh, boy, post it up.  Racism is over.  Oh, my God.  I'm sorry.  Y'all got to look up the ice cream song.  We was looking up the original version of the ice cream song and found out it was racist and it kind of blew our minds.  And then right after the song ended, this dude pulled up and it just put the icing on the cake.  Look at them urs.  I have no idea.  Can I talk to your friend here for a second?  You, what's your name, man?  Yeah, somebody just said that something happened and the person had red dreads.  What?  That's a pretty, that's a pretty, you know.  Are you serious right now?  Yeah, yeah, I'm serious.  Wow.  Spidey Jones.  That's a pretty unique thing.  I'm not saying.  You're serious right now.  But do you just have an ID on you really quick?  Yeah, I'm serious.  Not many people have red.  He doesn't have dreadlocks.  Those aren't even dreads.  I don't have dreads.  Those aren't even dreads.  Those aren't dreads.  I can't touch his hair, but show him those aren't even dreads.  Those aren't dreads.  They're not dreads.  Those are the tips of red.  Those aren't the tips.  That's the whole thing.  That's hilarious.  Do you have an idea on you really quick?  My boy's been here for mad hours.  You're accusing him of a crime.  Can he know what he's being accused of?  A robbery.  A robbery.  You're being accused of robbing somebody?  You're being accused of something?  You can't even hang out at your own house anymore?  He wants to see your ID because you're being accused of robbing someone.  If he sees your ID, he's going to know if you robbed somebody or not.  His ID is going to say I robbed someone or not.  So you want to see his ID to see if he just robbed someone because he fits the description of red dress.  Okay, I want to join this game.  That's really like messed up.  Okay, I'm a natural redhead.  My tips are red.  Which one of us robbed him?  I have red hair.  His is dyed.  Mine is natural.  What you're saying is not really making any sense.  I'm not talking to you.  I'm talking to you.  Who cares?  You're on my property.  I'm talking.  Yes, it is.  It's my property.  You own the apartment complex?  I actually own this apartment, yes.  And the property owner's name?  This one right here.  I own this one.  Yes, I actually do.  This isn't your property, right?  Oh, the whole thing though, but this right here, this is mine, yup.  Yeah, uh-huh.  Can I have your name, man, really quick?  He wants his name.  What do you mean by name?  Because you probably robbed someone, bro.  You have red hair.  You have red dreads.  You had to.  You have red dreads.  You fit the description of red dreads, bro, so you had to rob someone.  How?  Because you have red dreads, goddammit.  I don't have dreads, though.  Is it cool if I just get your name really quick?  Spidey Jones.  Spidey Jones, is that?  Is that really his hair color?  Like, are you serious right now?  I'm baffled right now.  I know, bro.  You fit the description, bro.  Is there any other description?  What color was the guy's skin?  It doesn't matter.  I'm talking out loud on my property.  Who cares?  I'm talking out loud.  Yeah, what color was the guy's skin?  Was it dark, fair, white?  He was black, Spidey.  With red dreads.  And he must have been having the rug rat outfit when he was robbing somebody.  On Valentine's Day, he was wearing a Rugrats thing robbing somebody.  Bro, this is really fucked up, bro.  Look, I know your friend is talking to you.  Like, no, bro, this is really fucked up.  I'm not talking.  I'm just talking.  This is funny as hell.  Like, is it okay if I get your name really quick?  Because right now, your friend's making all the decisions for you.  No, it sure doesn't matter, bro.  Like, I'm hilarious.  We actually are.  I gave my business card.  Oh, there it is.  That's my business card.  He wanted to look at it.  I'm going to talk to you really quick, man.  I don't know if... He thinks that somebody just robbed him.  I mean, he thinks Spidey just robbed somebody.  I know, this is hilarious.

It doesn't matter what my first name is.  I didn't rob anybody.  I don't have red dreads.  Why does he have to give you his first name?  Why does he have to give you his first name?
