You know, he said, you can drink any deadly thing.  It's not going to harm you.  The Bible constantly shows us we're not subject to this world.  So we shouldn't run around in fear, but we should be practical.  To your point again, Dr.  Glaze, we should be wise as serpents, but harmless as doves.  We still need to use wisdom.  Don't go around and breathing it all in.  But the same token, you don't need to be afraid and run away and buy up a bunch of beanie weenies and bottled water and worry that the world's coming to an end.  You have the blessing on your life.
