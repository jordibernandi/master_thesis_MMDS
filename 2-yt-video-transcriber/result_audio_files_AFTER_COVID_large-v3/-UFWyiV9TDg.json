            "text": "Good evening, everyone.  This is Steve Fletcher with the Trumpet for My People.  I want to get this information out for those who want to investigate.  This report that I'm sharing with you is the reason why, or according to this report, Donald Trump is no longer president.  This report says Donald Trump is no longer president.  Meet your new president, Pete Gaynor.  And here is the reason why, according to this report, this is the case.  Yesterday, the state of Wyoming became the 50th and final state to declare a state of emergency.  This is the first time in U.S.  history that all 50 states have declared a state of emergency.  This invokes the full powers of Executive Order 12148 signed by Jimmy Carter in 1979.  This executive order revokes presidential power in a time when all 50 states are in a state of emergency and transfers power from the President of the United States to FEMA Director Pete Gaynor.  I will leave the link to this article, which has the link to Executive Order 12148.  So the situation is, according to this report, and according to Executive Order 12148, that when all 50 states are under a state of emergency, this automatically will invoke Executive Order 12148, which will transfer power to FEMA and the standing president will no longer have the authority of the presidency.  The authority of the presidency has been transferred to FEMA based on all 50 states simultaneously being in a state of emergency.  So this is the information I want to share with you And this is not a complete report.  I don't have more information to add to this.  The best I can do right now is get this information out in this way and leave the link for you to be able to investigate this, to be able to understand this.  And this is maybe the answer to why over the last few days we've seen there's no presidential seal any longer.  This was exactly when Donald Trump declared a national emergency on March 13th, but simultaneously.  now each of the 50 states have all declared individually not just on a federal level but each state individually has declared a federal area a state of emergency.  okay so I just wanted to get this information out there for people who know more about internal government law can investigate this.  Be aware of the situation and be aware of the fact that Donald Trump may not be in the position of president any longer.  It may be under the direction that the whole country has been put under the direction of FEMA based on simultaneously all 50 states being in a state of emergency.  So I'll leave the link for you in the description box.  I pray you're blessed tonight.  This is Steve Fletcher with a trumpet for my people.  The sign of his coming revealed. ",
