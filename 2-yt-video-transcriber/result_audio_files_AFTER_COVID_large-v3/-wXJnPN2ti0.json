            "text": "Shalom, shalom, shalom to the 12 tribes of Yisrael that have been scattered to the four corners of the earth.  Shalom.  The purpose of this video is to make an announcement concerning Passover 2020.  As you all know, we have big plans for Passover this year.  And we always look forward to, you know, Hebrews, Israelites coming from all over the United States and other parts of the world to gather together for Pesach.  For sure, it's been one of the greatest events of the awakening to be able to keep Passover together.  And many thousands and thousands of people have got to know each other and have gotten closer together and become lifelong mishpachah, lifelong family as a result of our Passover gatherings.  But this year, of course, because of the coronavirus, We're not going to be able to do our large group Passover meeting.  As a matter of fact, with the new government restrictions on large crowds gathering, they have limited our area to 10 people, which is not a crowd at all.  And so therefore, unfortunately, we're not going to be able to have our gatherings.  I was, you know, trying to wait until the last minute to make sure that it would become, you know, that it would be government imposed before I made the video.  And of course, the news came out earlier this week that Fresno is not going to allow any large gatherings.  And of course, at this point, pretty much most of the city has been shut down.  So as much as I long to see you And as much as I look forward to us gathering together, unfortunately, we're just not going to be able to host the Passover celebration this year.  But we have made preparations and plans to make sure that every day of Passover we're gonna be recording and each day of Passover we're gonna record somewhere that we can get internet so that we can live stream the Passover.  So what does that mean?  Of course, it means several things.  First of all, it means that just because we're not going to have the large gathering does not mean that we all are not going to keep Passover.  No, we're going to keep Passover.  And we're going to, if you, no matter where you are, if you're at home with just you or if you're not under certain circumstances, restrictions and you want to gather together with a few friends, of course, we keep the Passover, we keep the feast, and we keep the feast for seven days.  We'll also use that time for Bible study, for prayer, and of course, as I mentioned earlier, every day we're going to try to live stream so that no matter where you're keeping the Passover, you will always, you'll have an opportunity to gather with the rest of the the world or those who are going to be working with the awakening remnant during that time are going to be, I should say, worshipping with the awakening remnant.  That way we can all worship together.  Also, for those of you who have already booked your airline tickets, this is a good time to call and make arrangements that will know that you're not going to be using those tickets.  You can also ask or request the airline.  maybe allow you to get a voucher so that those of you who are coming out for Passover, you can use that to come out to Sukkot because we are still planning to do Sukkot, and that would be something that you can do.  So you want to make sure you call them.  If you've already booked a hotel and you need to make an arrangement, please call the hotel directly, explain to them the situation.  Believe me, everybody in Fresno already knows about what's going on with the coronavirus, and therefore they are very accommodating right now.  I'm also going to ask that everybody please spread the spread the message because not everybody gets a chance to see these videos, especially if I don't live stream.  A lot of times the.  algorithm of the video doesn't post immediately on people's sites so make sure that you not only subscribe but like and share this particular video with everybody that you know that was going to come to our passover celebration or or who had even thought about coming.  let them know that this year you know based on the coronavirus we're not going to be able uh to gather.  Remember that Passover is eight days long, so we don't want to forget the fact that there is also the Feast of Unleavened Bread, where we remove all of the leaven from the house and we don't eat any leavened bread until the eight days are completed.  um yes so the registration is obviously uh have been closed.  if you have any further questions concerning passover accounts the constellation of the large group event or anything like that please feel free to contact the awakening remnant at awakening remnant dot info.  All right, awakeningremnant.info.  And of course, our administrators can definitely get more information concerning that.  And once again, I'm really going to miss everybody.  You know, we do these meetups all over the nation every year.  And then one of the highlights, of course, is, you know, some of the people that we get a chance to meet with as we travel.  To all be able to come together and spend that week together or even just a few days together is just something I'm really going to miss.  But continue to pray for us.  We'll pray for you according to Romans.  No, what's that?  According to Philippians.  chapter 1, around verse 9 and 10, it talks about the fact that we should pray one for another, that we would advance and grow in knowledge and wisdom, and that we would continue to abound in love one toward another and.
