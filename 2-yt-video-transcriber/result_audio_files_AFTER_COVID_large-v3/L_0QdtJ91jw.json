            "text": "A prophet is one who carries the future.  The prophet is also one that brings life and preservation.  Bible tells us quite clearly that the word of the Lord that came through the prophet, speaking of Moses, preserved Israel.  When the word of the Lord comes, there is preservation for you.  What you're gonna hear in these shows is God's plans for what he's gonna do, his next course of events, and possibly where you will be going in life, destiny and purpose.  I've traveled all over the world, and as a prophetic voice, I've managed to go to some of the difficult areas in the world, where there's conflict, there's war, anger, hatred, and done what a prophet's supposed to do.  Not only prophesy and bring the word of the Lord, but also to do good works.  And that's what we've done, and that's what I want you to experience as well. ",

            "text": "What is a crown?  Let me read to you out of Revelation 3, verse 11.  And I'm not taking it out of context.  I realize it's speaking to the church.  It's speaking to the future as well, but I'm going to apply it to the now.  How you can lose your crown.  Revelation 3, 11 says, I am coming soon.  That word soon also means suddenly.  Hold on to what you have.  Everybody watching me all over the world say, hold on to what you have.  There you go.  So that no one will take your crown.  This is the revelation of Jesus Christ.  As written down by John on the island of Patmos.  He says there, so that no one will take your crown.  In other words, if you don't hold on to what you have, your crown could be removed.  So to explain to you what the crown is, because somebody might be saying, well, crown doesn't speak of salvation.  The crown doesn't speak of healing.  That's in the covenant.  And I understand that.  So bear with me.  Because many of you are losing a grip on the authority that God's given you and you don't know why.  And you could be doing something very simple where everything's going chaotic.  Jonah was told to go to Nineveh.  That was God's instruction.  He did the exact opposite.  He went to Tarshish.  He went on a vacation from the presence of the Lord.  And as a result of it, what happened to him was, tell me now catastrophe and in in in and he had.  catastrophic event took place where the the storm rage and he ended up being thrown overboard at his will and swallowed by as you know a great fish which he again was.  he repented in the belly of the fish can you imagine the stench there?  just there alone all the gases and stuff and he got spat out and said now go to Nineveh.  So what I'm trying to show you is that you can disalign, if there's such a word, yourself with God's perfect light, His will, and what He wants in your life.  When you do that, catastrophic events take place.  side of the coin that you will also have attacks that will come which is spiritual warfare from your enemy when you do the right thing.  So you've got to discern whether you are out of the will of God and you have caused the shipwrecks or you are in the will of God and this is just an attack from your enemy.  You know Paul was on a shipwreck and what happened was there was a massive storm which he perceived was going to happen and he knew it was.  but he knew that he was in the perfect will of God even though he was on the storm.  amazing in the storm but he told them that they would all be saved but the ship would be wrecked.  that was not an act of God.  it was not because he was out of the will of God.  so then you have two different storms.  the one storm is a man that that gets out of alignment to the will of God and runs away from the presence of the Lord.  I'll explain that in a minute.  and then the other one who is in the will of God and has a storm he knows it's going to happen he knows the outcome and he is able to get them all to safety on an island.  okay so what is a crown?  There you go.  So a crown is a symbol of power.  Every Christian has an element of power.  Not only a symbol, but an actual event of power, which is given to you when the Holy Spirit came upon you.  So a crown is a symbol of power and a dominion of a sovereign.  Now you may be saying, well, I'm just a regular guy in the street.  No, you're not.  If you are a Christian, the Bible says in Revelation that you are priests and you are kings unto our God.  So what you possess is a kingly and a priestly anointing inside of you.  Sometimes the king speaks, sometimes the prophet speaks, sometimes the priest in you arises.  So you've got three specific spiritual expressions that arise from inside of you, that live inside of you.  Now, a symbol of power.  Let's talk about a sovereign.  What is a sovereign?  Well, a sovereign is one with rightful status.  He has independence and is a supreme and unrestricted power.  That's what a sovereign is.  So in your own world, there is an element of sovereignty that you have.  What?  I thought I was completely under the control of God.  No, you're not.  There is a sovereignty that you have when you are a king in God's kingdom.  You have unrestricted power in your own world so you can decide exactly what you like when you wake up tomorrow morning.  It could be a day wasted or it could be a day that is used for the kingdom of God.  You have that power.  God's not gonna twist your arm, He's not gonna punish you, but you have the power.  So that's what a crown is.  It gives you that sovereign power to rule and reign, whatever.  So the concept of the crown originates from a turban.  So, or more formally, if you wish, metallic crown that was decorated with jewels.  And when it was placed on someone's head, it basically indicated that the person was set apart for a particular task or calling.  Every one of you watching me, you have a particular task and calling, which means you have a kingly anointing, you have a crown.  The crown indicated the consecrated role of the person wearing it.  So since it could be profaned.  So if you're looking at history, you're looking at culture, the crown has a consecrated role of the person wearing it, but it could be profaned.  Kim, show me in the Bible where it says that.  Psalm 89 verse 39.  You have renounced the covenant with your servant and have defiled his crown in the dust.  So the renouncement of the covenant is the issue that I'm dealing with.  Not your salvation.  I'm not dealing with beyond this life.  I'm dealing with this life now.  You have renounced the covenant with your servant and have defiled his crown in the dust.  Just showing you that there's a denouncing of renouncing of the covenant and as a result, the defiling of the crown in the dust.  Dust speaks of flesh.  So the crown's still there, but it's on the head of flesh.  It's not on a spiritual man.  I'll show you later on or in the next session, we're gonna have a few sessions on this, how certain ones lost their crowns and why they lost their crowns, but they still were kings, but they had no authority.  So there was a crown on their head, but it was a crown that was on a flesh, not on a spiritual being.  That can happen.  Some people still think that they have the authority because they have this thing stuck on their head, but actually you've lost your authority because it's been profaned, it's been defiled.  Once you've earned the crown, can you actually lose it?  So I read to you Revelations, ",
