            "text": "Hey guys, I have a brief little anecdote that ties into one of the traits of the modern western woman.  So earlier today I went to the bank to cash a check.  I run into an old teacher and we catch up and have a great little conversation.  Then I go inside and I proceed to have some of the worst customer service I've had in recent memory from some dumb thought who's a five with the makeup that she has on.  Terrible eyebrows.  You know, she's cute enough, but she's absolutely rude.  And then I listen to her ranting to another customer in front of me.  And she's talking about how she's going to tell the husband today that she doesn't want to work anymore.  And if you can't support her, they're going to have a conversation.  And that got me thinking about just the average woman today in the West.  She's too dumb to play it safe.  She's too dumb to take what she has and go with it.  Now there's some women who grow up in a conservative, not patriarchal household, but semi-patriarchal.  And they value, you know, being content, settling in a way.  But nowadays, these women, they feel like they are entitled to... her entitlement knows no bounds and she feels that she can continue playing her hand and keep playing new hands and if you know any gamblers in your life it's very similar to how women operate on the sexual marketplace.  they think they can keep trading up and trading up until one day she realizes her looks aren't that good anymore.  she's overplayed her hand And she can't even manage to be decent as a bank teller at a bank.  And I just thought it was funny because if I saw that woman on Tinder or somewhere I was out where I was single or something.  I mean, this woman, maybe she'd be worth a cold approach at most for a casual encounter, but nothing beyond that.  You know, she doesn't have the looks.  You could tell she was cuter when she was younger, but that mental illness that comes with the liberation of women, which is very interesting.  to note that the most self-proclaimed liberated woman is oftentimes the most mentally ill, the most mentally disturbed.  The most destructive person that you could know.  And there's many signs that display this.  Oftentimes crazy fucking eyebrows.  They have terrible eyebrows.  They have nasty hair that's been destroyed with constant dying, mistreatment of the hair.  They're getting pudgy.  They're eating poorly.  Incredible.  How that displays itself.  How that liberation creates a destructive tendency within the Western woman.  And this woman had all of those traits.  And it was amusing to observe that poor husband she's going to go home to.  Who's going to think that she's entitled to something that she's not.  That she can't even handle... a little bit of work?  she can't handle sustaining herself doing a simple job.  and i know plenty of women who are like this who work for maybe five six years and they feel like they're ready to retire.  do you not understand as a woman that you've now signed up for um egalitarian principles so you are now going to pay your way through society?  that's what happened by getting yourself in the workplace by flooding the work market with additional women.  now the wages have been cut in half and now it requires two people to work to sustain themselves and you want to sit here and bitch and complain that you can't even work a basic job and you can't even do a decent job at it and you're going to go home to the husband and say that It pissed me off for a moment, but then I considered, you know, the husband, he needs to wake up, you know, he needs to learn that marriage is not a deal worth having today.  It has nothing to benefit a man.  And, you know, you need that family unit if you're going to be raising children, but it's not truly a family unit because you're held hostage.  You're held at gunpoint by the government.  And anytime she wants to pull that trigger, you're out of the picture.  And so now it's no longer a discussion.  This woman is not going to go home and have a discussion.  She's going to have an ultimatum.  She's already made her decision, and if he can't cope with it, he's expendable.  She has that piss poor attitude, that lack of loyalty, that disgusting expendable nature that she sees men with.  And it's going to reflect poorly on her.  Any relationship she has is doomed to fail.  And ironically enough, she's going to be stuck doing these menial jobs that she hates so much.  She's going to be stuck in this routine for the rest of her life because of her self-destructive tendencies that come from her liberated nature.  the western woman is not liberated.  she is enslaved to her sexual desires.  she is enslaved to the inability to settle and to constantly overplay her hand until she has no more assets to play.  She's going to be old.  She's going to be in her mid-30s.  Her looks have deteriorated.  She's cute enough for a casual bang, maybe a friend with benefits with some probably oftentimes younger guy.  She becomes what's known as a starter girlfriend.  And, you know, that is her destiny to remain like that.  Her lottery ticket becomes finding a simp.  Her lottery ticket becomes finding a weak man who has financial backing to sustain her lifestyle.  And that resentment that she has for settling for someone below her on the sexual marketplace scale, even though she's fallen herself, will drive that relationship to ruin and, you know, hopefully wake up that beta cucks guy.  But oftentimes those guys do the opposite of what she's doing where they underplay their hand.  They don't understand the value they have as a man.  And they worship and they are grateful for receiving sloppy seconds.  Not even sloppy seconds.  It's, you know, sloppy second hundreds.  So... She's destined to a life of servitude, enslaved to her biological imperatives.  And as single men, we can just sit back and laugh.  It's ironic when I go to these restaurants and fast food places, when I go to somewhere like Subway.  Subway kind of sucks, but it's near where I work, so I go there on weekends.  And it's so ironic because every time I'm in fucking Subway, it's some young girl making me a sandwich.  And, you know, it's that meme of women making sandwiches.  But you've now become a pawn for a corporation.  You're now making sandwiches for a hundred faceless men in a series of uneventful interactions where you could have been at home making a sandwich for your husband and your children.  but you've traded that in.  you were too dumb to play it safe and you traded that in for something infinitely worse.  and that's the state of the game we're in.  i don't have sympathy for these women.  um i feel bad that they destroy the family unit.  they destroyed any semblance of interaction meaningful interaction and and trust and Building something together beyond superficial sexual encounters.  But that is the state of the game.  And, you know, they played their hand.  They overplayed their hand.  And now they have to deal with the consequences. ",
