            "text": "I swear this story made me laugh so hard.  There are so many layers to it.  I will try to go in order to make sense of it all for you and me both.  I promise you, though, the buildup is worth it.  Let's say you're an infant who's getting baptized in the Catholic Church.  If you're not familiar with this ritual, getting baptized like this means you are officially a Catholic and you are declared free of original sin.  It's like a vaccination against your evil baby nature.  It's not just a random tradition either.  This is one of those things you are obligated to do if you're Catholic, or your parents are raising you as a Catholic.  It's a sacrament.  It's a big deal.  It's generally considered a requirement if you want salvation.  Though there are some exceptions to that.  And baptism is kind of like the gateway drug for Catholicism.  You gotta be baptized before you could try all the other Catholic things.  Now, during the ceremony, the priest is supposed to say, I baptize you in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.  But for many years, there was this informal movement to say it's not just the priest doing the baptism.  You know, who's welcoming you into the Catholic Church?  It's the parents and the godparents and the grandparents and friends.  I mean, everybody.  So some priests would baptize babies saying, We baptize you in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.  Now here's an interesting question.  Are priests allowed to use the phrase, We baptize you, instead of I baptize you?  This past August, the Vatican decided to weigh in on this.  Have you ever heard of the Inquisition?  It was actually a part of the Catholic Church created in the 16th century dedicated to rooting out heresy.  Famously, there was a Spanish Inquisition.  Nobody expected it.  Among other things, this was the branch of the Church that said Galileo was a heretic for saying the Earth revolved around the Sun.  Which is true.  And it forced him to take it back.  Anyway, because it's probably a bad idea to still call something the Inquisition arm of the Catholic Church, they've rebranded.  They're now called the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.  Their job, though, is still playing referee, deciding if something or someone violates Catholic doctrine.  So they decided to weigh in on the baptism controversy.  Specifically, they wanted to answer two questions, and I'll paraphrase.  One, is it okay to say we baptize you,  etc.?  And two, if you got baptized that way, did it count?  Their answers?  No, it's not okay to say we, and no, any baptisms that occurred that way don't count.  They spent some time explaining their decision, but basically they argued that when a priest baptizes someone, he's taking on the role of Christ.  One dude.  So you cannot baptize a baby in the name of the community, even if you mean well.  You must baptize babies in the name of Christ and Christ alone.  Now I should add, they've said this sort of thing before.  In 2012, people asked if they could baptize babies using non-masculine pronouns.  So instead of Father, Son and Holy Spirit, what about the Creator, the Redeemer and the Sanctifier?  And the Inquisition?  people said the same thing.  It's not okay.  Stick to the script we gave you.  But here's the takeaway for this part of the story.  The Catholic Church now says it does not count if a priest says, we baptize you.  When the Vatican announced all this over the summer, it was especially troubling for a priest named Matthew Hood, who works in the Archdiocese of Detroit in Michigan.  When the pandemic began, his father was going through their old things and stumbled upon a camcorder video of Matthew's infant baptism from 1990.  Seemed like a fun thing to share with him now that he's a priest himself.  And when Matthew watched it, he realized the priest who baptized him used the phrase, We baptize you.  And he knew from his own training that's not what you're supposed to say.  He realized at that moment that his baptism may not technically count.  But just to be sure, he asked his seminary professors and other priests for their opinion.  And it was this questioning that seems to have led the Inquisition people to issue their statement this past August.  Now, this should be an easy fix for Matthew.  He just needs to get re-baptized now, the right way.  And that's exactly what he did.  He actually received all the sacraments again to make sure he's on the church's good side.  So problem solved, right?  Silly story, easy fix.  Not a real issue, right?  Oh no.  The problems were just beginning.  here's what Father Matthew Hood figured out really quickly.  If he wasn't baptized as a baby, and he technically wasn't, then he was never really a Christian, according to the superstitious rules of the Catholic Church.  And if he wasn't a Christian, then he couldn't really be a Catholic priest, no matter what he did or learned in seminary.  And if he was never really a priest, then just about all the rituals he performed pretending to be a priest or cosplaying as a priest were completely invalid.  Just consider the confession booth.  If someone confessed their sins to him and he forgave them on behalf of God, No, he didn't.  Those people are technically still unrepentant sinners because they didn't confess to a real priest.  What about communion wafers?  If this priest, or should I say priest, conducted a Catholic Mass, which he did every week for years, and gave people the wafer and wine, which Catholics believe become the literal body and blood of Christ after a priest consecrates them, It turns out they were really just eating a crappy wafer and cheap wine.  No Jesus parts.  Because the priest never really had the power to transform the Eucharist.  What about Last Rites?  If he cleansed the sins of people on their deathbeds, supposedly preparing their souls for the afterlife, it was all for nothing, since he didn't cleanse them of anything.  By the way, that included his own grandmother.  Matthew Hood anointed her just before she died.  If that didn't count, where was Grandma's soul now?  Now, obviously, as an atheist, I think everything I just told you is silly.  I mean, a priest's magical words don't actually change anything.  I don't care if a baby is baptized.  And I don't think a wafer can actually become the body of anything.  But Catholics take this stuff seriously.  That's kind of the whole point.  So not only was Matthew Hood not really a priest that whole time, and not only was he not even a Catholic that whole time, all those religious rituals he performed were, spiritually speaking, worthless.  It's like shooting blanks after you've had a vasectomy.  You can go through the motions and it might feel the same, but there's nothing on the other side.  Once Matthew Hood realized that his entire Catholic life was a lie, the Archdiocese of Detroit, where he worked, did two things that were buck wild.  The first is that they began a kind of spiritual contact tracing.  trying to find anyone who received a sacrament from Reverend Hood or HIS old priest from as far back as 1986 when that guy started his job to warn them and say, hey, maybe you need to come back because there's been a gigantic mistake.  Can you imagine trying to get in touch with everyone this priest supposedly conferred sacraments on to let them know they're in spiritual danger because they're still technically dirty, rotten sinners?  They said if you were confirmed into the church by Matthew Hood, it doesn't count.  If you confessed your sins to him, it doesn't count.  If you got married by him, the state may recognize your marriage, but the church doesn't.  If someone you love was anointed on a deathbed by Father Hood, it doesn't count.  the entire Catholic cinematic universe started collapsing because of a two-letter word used on one guy three decades ago.  The only thing the Archdiocese said was okay were the infant baptisms performed by fatherhood, because the Catholic Church's rules don't say a priest has to do it.  Someone's just gotta follow the rules and procedures in order for it to count.  Which is why it's important to say the exact right words, like, I baptize you.  but everything else was a problem.  The second thing they did is try to play down the whole situation like it's not really a big deal, even though it was totally a big deal.  The Archdiocese argued that you're only guilty of a sin if you know you're committing a sin.  So if you spilled your heart out in a confessional booth to fatherhood in good faith, it's fine.  Kind of.  And if you took your first communion from Him and believed it, sure, that matters.  Sort of.  Same with getting married in a church, even if an actual priest didn't perform the ceremony.  What about the deathbed anointing?  The Archdiocese said God knew you wanted to receive the sacrament, so we're pretty confident He's cool with it.  Maybe.  Hey, grandchildren, don't look down because you might see someone you didn't expect to see.  When it comes down to it, though, the Catholic Church needs to figure out its own rules.  Either you have to get the sacraments the right way to be eligible for salvation, or you have to admit the sacraments don't really matter and that they're merely suggestions and that people who have faith will be fine no matter what.  Catholics are taught that there are some things you have to do.  You have to get baptized.  You have to confess your sins, etc.  There have always been some exceptions in some circumstances.  But generally speaking, those rules apply to everyone.  If the Church is suddenly going to say it's the thought that counts, then they're admitting the rules are just meaningless to begin with.  You can't have it both ways.  They are totally trying to have it both ways.  The Archdiocese even responded this way on their website to the question of, won't God just take care of this tiny little mistake?  In other words, are you seriously telling me God's going to punish me for a mistake I had nothing to do with?  As far as God taking care of it, we can trust that God will assist those whose hearts are open to Him.  However, we can have a much greater degree of confidence by strengthening ourselves with the sacraments He has entrusted to us.  So trust God.  But, you know, verify.  Faith only goes so far.  With God, you can't be too sure.  I think atheists win this round.  By the way, Matthew Hood seems like a perfectly decent guy.  But he is just one dude.  And yet his botched baptism had these huge ripple effects.  I mean, not really.  It's all just a mental game.  But if you're a believing Catholic, it's very consequential.  How many other priests right now are not technically priests because they're in the same situation without even realizing it.  How many Catholics were actually affected by this one-word change that may have gone unnoticed much of the time?  Is the Pope even really Catholic?  This whole thing is just a hilarious, yet very serious if you're a believer, example of how religious thinking hurts us.  Sometimes certain rules get taken so literally, the ripple effect of breaking the rule can get absurd, which is what we're seeing here.  Other times, it looks like God is sending ironclad rules.  Thou shalt not kill.  Thou shalt not covet.  Thou shalt not bear false witness, which turn out to be merely suggestions to many Christians.  I say you're better off ditching the whole thing.  Don't let your life get taken over by things.  These people are clearly making up as they go along.  By the way, this video was sponsored by Gurmania, and he has this video, Why I Don't Argue Against Classical Theism or Creationism, where he makes a case for why atheists may be missing the mark on what we think are intellectual debates.  It certainly gave me a lot to think about.  Be sure to check it out.  The link is in the description below. ",
