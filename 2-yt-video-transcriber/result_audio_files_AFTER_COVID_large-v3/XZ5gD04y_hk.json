            "text": "Hey folks.  Remember how back in November of 2019 there was a totally legitimate change of government in Bolivia?  And a new transitional government finally put an end to the evil Evo Morales dictatorship?  Well, that interim transitional government is still in power despite having never won an election.  And they've also used the present global situation to justify postponing the elections indefinitely.  Quite an interesting transition there.  And as you may have heard, they've committed a ton of massacres and have cracked down on dissent, arresting anyone they feel like on trumped up charges of sedition and terrorism.  Well, cancelling the elections was just the start of it.  They've also used the pandemic as an excuse to crack down even harder on the political opposition.  In late March, they pushed through a presidential decree and gave themselves the power to arrest pretty much anyone for whatever reason that they want.  and Human Rights Watch issued a statement denouncing it.  The interim government of Bolivia is taking advantage of the pandemic to give itself the power to criminally charge those who publish information that the authorities consider incorrect, and this violates freedom of expression.  On the 25th of March 2020, the interim president Janine \u00c1\u00f1ez passed Supreme Decree 4200, which widened the scope of the quarantine.  One of its dispositions, Article 13, stipulates that people who incite breaches of this supreme decree, or who disinform or generate uncertainty among the population, will be criminally charged for committing crimes against public health.  Government officials have mentioned specifically that political opposition are possible targets for these charges of disinformation.  The decree does not specify what actions or statements qualify as disinformation or as acts that generate uncertainty among the population.  This ambiguous language without any clear legal definition could be used to silence opinions or comments that are protected under the right to freedom of expression, said Human Rights Watch.  This is translated from the original publication in Spanish, which you can find down below in the description.  Well, guess what?  Yesterday, a citizen named Mauricio Jara was arrested and charged with sedition.  His crime?  Well, I'll let this pro-government news station tell you in their own words. ",

No nos olvidemos que de acuerdo a sus declaraciones emitidas por este se\u00f1or, es af\u00edn al partido de la anterior gesti\u00f3n de gobierno, m\u00e1s propiamente al MAS.  According to the investigations carried out by the Special Struggle Force Against Crime, El Aprendido handled a large number of WhatsApp groups and was a member of more than 40 of them, where he misinformed the population, sowing confrontation and fear, discrediting the current government party.

            "text": "Yep, that's a guy being paraded before the media, flanked by two men with rifles, wearing a vest that says, all because, in their own words, he committed the unspeakable crime of being associated with an opposition political party and ran some WhatsApp groups where he criticized the government.  Look, it doesn't even matter if what he said in those WhatsApp groups was true or not.  But I mean, it probably was because, let's be real, We're talking about an unelected dictatorship here.  People obviously shouldn't be arrested just for what they say about the government, whether it's true or not.  And in the government's almost hilarious quest to spread as much hysteria as possible, they're calling him a digital gorilla.  Like he's some sort of modern-day Che Guevara for running WhatsApp groups while having the wrong opinions.  And this isn't even the first time this has happened.  There's been thousands of these cases.  Back in January, a former executive of a Bolivian public transport company was arrested for being a so-called digital gorilla for her alleged support of Evo Morales and just a couple of weeks ago they arrested 67 people in one day for what they call waging virtual war.  Now, this is so stupid and ridiculous that it sounds like I'm making it up, but it's true.  All of this is from extremely pro-government news sources and they openly announce this stuff.  They're proud of it.  How can anyone say, oh, Eva Morales was a dictator?  and then watch his replacement just openly celebrate crushing any dissent and just be silent about it or even outright support it.  Everyone who supported this coup is guilty of helping to bring this dictatorship to power and is complicit in its crimes.  From the Organization of American States to its diplomatic allies to the journalists who supported the coup, and maybe even to you if you did.  People like them have helped to put Mauricio Jara and thousands of others in jail for the crime of being against the government.  They have helped to massacre dozens of people for the crime of protesting against the government.  I hope that anyone who was at all supportive of this coup for even a second will have the guts to take a long hard look at themselves.  Because make no mistake, this is absolutely going to happen again, whether it's in Bolivia or elsewhere.  Thanks for watching.  Special thanks to all of my patrons, and especially my $25 plus patrons.  Fer Tahon, Shub, Super Pancake Man, Tonga Purutu Neha, Jesse Hosik, and my $10 plus patrons.  See ya! ",
