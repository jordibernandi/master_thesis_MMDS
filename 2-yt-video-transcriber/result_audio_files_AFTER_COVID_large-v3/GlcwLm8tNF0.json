            "text": "Starting June 6, 2020, and every weekend since, shark investigators swept into rural Kentucky to infiltrate, document, expose, and stop illegal cockfighting.  This operation was undertaken with financial support from our partners at the Humane Farming Association.  The video we captured of illegal animal abuse is too strong for YouTube.  To see the extended, uncensored version of this video, please visit Shark's Facebook page.  A link is in the description.  Our targets were Shaker Hill in Butler County, Honest Abe's in McCreary County, and the Laurel Creek Game Club in Clay County.  We are proud to announce that, as of the release of this video, all three locations which were occurring every Saturday have been shut down by our efforts, saving thousands of lives.  We will continue to work to make sure all of these sites never reopen.  We not only captured brutal acts of cruelty, but also serious police misconduct and outright corruption.  These are actual law enforcement officers with the Clay County Sheriff's Department cavorting with cockfighters.  They are watching extreme animal abuse and illegal gambling, the very behavior they are supposed to stop.  These thugs have become the very criminals they are supposed to stand against.  Tragically, this type of police corruption is why cockfighting continues in Kentucky and beyond.  And they were not the only police to betray their oaths.  On June 13th, the Kentucky State Police Troop 11 were called on by Shark to shut down the Honest Abe's Cockfight, and yet when they arrived on the scene, they pulled over to the side of the road and allowed 33 vehicles and dozens of cockfighters to escape.  A week later, Shark flew drones over the cockfighting building and filmed live birds being brought in and dead and dying birds being brought out.  We relayed this clear evidence to the state police, but they did nothing.  These cockfights are not small backyard ventures.  They are highly organized criminal operations stationed in structures purpose-built for cockfighting, including fighting arenas, stadium seating, and even concession stands.  We are asking everyone to contact the governor of Kentucky.  Please politely demand that Kentucky's anti-cockfighting laws be strengthened and enforced, and for there to be a full investigation into the actions of the police officers we filmed.  If this is the brand of activism you want to see from the animal protection movement, then please support both Shark and HFA.  We are not here to waste time and money while the animals suffer.  We are here to save lives, and we will do the hard work to get that job done. ",
