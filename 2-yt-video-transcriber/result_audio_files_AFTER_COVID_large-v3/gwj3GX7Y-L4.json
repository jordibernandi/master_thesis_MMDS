            "text": "All right, top of the morning, gang.  We're doing something a little different today.  You know, it's coronavirus and we're all quarantined, so I figured we'd try to do something a little bit to help others.  And we're starting with what Freedom Foods, it's called Power Balls.  It's breakfast is one of the most important meals of the day.  We know from just studies and just, you know, it fully just, your mood and everything else just energizes you for the rest of the day.  Something really simple we came up with, we saw a recipe and we modified it.  Um, basically the primary ingredient is oatmeal and then the other ingredients, it varies.  There's a lot of things you can choose from here, but the main one is rolled oats, peanut butter, which we use the Kirkland organic peanut butter.  You can use almond butter, cashew butter, whatever you like.  Some people don't like peanuts too.  Yeah, I have allergies.  They can find something that's a substitute.  We've got a variety.  So like I said, the main ingredients is your rolled oats, your peanut butter.  You've got to have maple syrup, which we've already kind of pre-poured.  So there's three cups rolled oats, one full cup of peanut butter, almond butter.  And then half a cup of maple syrup.  And then all these other ingredients you can add.  We have flaxseed.  We got sliced almonds.  We got shredded coconut.  Oh, no, man.  We got raisins.  And this is the added surprise.  What are we doing?  that one on?  Chocolate.  Chocolate chips.  Yeah, so you can do chocolate chips, maybe mini M&Ms.  And what are these?  Do you remember?  No.  Walnuts.  Walnuts are really good for your brain.  So we'll take some walnuts, we'll crush them up and put them in there too.  The other things we have are hemp hearts, then we have chia seeds, and then, oh yeah, and then the other thing, you gotta add a little bit of salt.  So we do a quarter teaspoon of salt with the combination of the three oats.  Oh, yeah, we don't have lupinums, but you can use lupinums.  It takes the healthiness away from it.  But that's if you have it with a kid.  This is a group that you can do with your kids.  They like to keep their hands in there.  Did you wash your hands this morning?  I washed my hands.  Okay.  Okay, Noah, so let's go.  Three cups.  So in this combination here, you've got a couple different ways you can measure.  You don't have to have a measuring cup.  You can use a usual cup from your cupboard.  So three cups.  Go ahead, Noah.  Three cups of rolled oats.  I'm going to get a spoon for this.  That's two in there and one in there.  We're going to eyeball the peanut butter.  You're supposed to use a full cup, but I don't want to get this thing super dirty, so I'm just going to get a big spoon.  And then we'll use our little spatula.  So it's this much syrup in, a whole cup of syrup in.  It's actually a half a cup of syrup.  That's a lot of sugar.  And that's the big thing.  why we started doing this is because, you know, just all the different power bars and stuff you can buy out there.  There's so much added sugar and just preservatives.  This is a way you can know for sure what you're putting in there.  And supposedly all this stuff is super healthy.  I mean, that's what the media tells us and the bags tell us that they're healthy, right?  Okay.  Okay.  So what else are we going to add, Noah?  Just do a handful of the chia seed.  Let's do a tablespoon here.  I've got a tablespoon right here.  A tablespoon?  Okay.  And here's my salt, a quarter teaspoon of salt.  Sprinkle that in there.  It doesn't have to be perfect.  You can just grab a pinch of things too.  It doesn't really have to be exact.  A lot of these don't really have a lot of flavor.  You get most of your flavor from the peanut butter, the coconut, the raisins.  Okay, so the chia seed's done.  Now we'll grab the shredded coconut.  I'm going to break up a few walnuts.  I'm going to crush them in my hand.  Get some crunchy texture.  We already have a lot of walnuts.  They don't have to be perfect.  Walnuts, I'm making a mess here.  But that's the fun part for the kids.  What?  Okay.  Oh, you want to do some raisins?  What?  Oh, raisins.  And then I'm going to do a little bit of the flax seed.  A little bit in there.  A little bit.  There you go.  Like I said, it doesn't have to be perfect.  Just know your main ingredient.  Get the syrup ready.  You want to do a couple of the chocolate chips?  Okay.  We're not going to do almonds this time, but that's an option as well.  It's already kind of nutty.  The dark chocolate ones are really good too.  I think these are just regular.  Yeah, these are just the milk chocolate and that's it.  We're not promoting any brands.  As you can see, we have a lot of different brands here.  Get a shot of the money shot, babe.  The money shot.  Okay, this is the fun part.  Now you get to get your hands in there.  The kids love it.  They get to mix it all up.  You can use a spoon if you want, but I let the kids get in there and mix it up a little bit.  Now you get to mix it really good.  Try to keep it all in the bowl, okay, Noah?  Okay.  And then I'm going to get a tray to put them in.  You can obviously eat them right away.  You can obviously eat them right away.  I don't know.  Ideally, you want to put them in the fridge, let them solidify a little bit, and then they're just a little grab-and-go.  You keep them in a Tupperware in the fridge and grab a few in the morning, take some with you on a hike, take some with you prior to the workout, surf, whatever.  Keep it going.  There you go.  There's one.  Just start packing them together.  What?  You can even lick it.  Just lick your hands though.  This is the one time he can lick his hands.  You could obviously just scoop it out too.  I'm just trying to make it fun for the kids.  The hard part is keeping him from eating all the chocolate chips.  As you can see, It's fun, now I get to lick my fingers.  And how many did we get?  Five times, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, thirty, oh, thirty-five of them.  All different sizes, daddy sized bites and kid sized bites.  Thanks guys for watching.

Oh, and now we're going to go for a nice run, like, like a key, ghost town.  I'm sending you some video.  Take care. ",
