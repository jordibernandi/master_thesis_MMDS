            "text": "In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.  We're approaching the end of a calendar year.  And I'm sure that most, if not all of you, will look back on 2020... and say that was a year from hell.  And I mean that.  This is and has been a year from hell.  For whatever reason, divine providence seems to have allowed the unleashing of an unprecedented number of demons with great power upon the face of the earth.  It's unprecedented and a year ago unthinkable that an entire world would shut down, literally in modern times, shut down.  It would have been unthinkable a year ago that we would spend all of Holy Week and Easter having mass in a parking lot, in snow and rain and cold and winds.  And if this year has been the year from hell, and it has been, this past week has been the worst of the year, the worst week from hell.  As we have been forced to Stand by and watch the children of darkness steal away an election.  Steal an election right before our very eyes.  There's no doubt about that now.  But God allows... some things to happen.  Not by his active will, but his passive will.  That is, he will allow evil to act for some greater good.  And historically it seems that before God brings a corrective upon a people or the world, God allows evil to become more manifest for what it is.  A case in point would be the 10 plagues upon the Egyptians.  Over and over and over again, God punished them so that even the servants and the court officials said to Pharaoh, stop, give in.  This is the hand of God.  But Pharaoh became all the more hardened in his heart and wicked.  God sometimes says, allows evil to become more manifest for what it is I think so that people are forced to choose culpably between evil and good and they will have no excuse in the judgment.  and what we have become aware of in the past days weeks months and years is the presence and activity of what Archbishop Vigano calls the children of darkness, which means those who knowingly or unknowingly align themselves with the prince of this world, the evil one, Satan, who were at war with the children of light, who are allied with the king of the universe, Jesus Christ.  We have become painfully aware of the presence and activity of the children of darkness.  The children of darkness for the most part run the mainstream media.  The children of darkness we now know manipulate and control social media.  The children of darkness have infiltrated our government institutions at the highest level and most critical places.  We call that the deep state.  The children of darkness oversee our educational process.  The children of darkness pretty much comprise one major political party whose platform stands on the murder of unborn and newly born children.  And it is the children of darkness who are attempting to steal this election.  And it is the children of darkness who have already declared their candidate to be the victor.  And I do not accept that.  And neither should you.  So evil is being manifested today.  And people are forced to make a choice.  And the good news in this is it does appear, especially if ballots were honestly counted, that many people are starting to get it and moving towards the light, if not already fully in the light.  Statistically, it looks like more Catholics, practicing or not, have voted pro-life this year than has been the case in decades.  That's an example of what I mean between the choice between darkness and light.  Another reason God allows things such as this is that it deepens our own faith and commitment to truth and God.  Through the increased prayers in number and intensity, over a period of time, we are the better for it.  Even if we don't get, or especially if we don't get the answer that we would prefer.  We are the better for the prayer and the penances and whatever else we might have done as children of the light.  And our job as soldiers of Christ, as children of the light, is not over.  This election is not over.  And our prayers are not over, but we are the better for it.  And please do not discourage yourself and others by making statements to the effect, it's over.  The children of darkness have declared that it's over.  The children of darkness have declared for their candidate, it's not over.  for the children of light.  And don't discourage yourself and others by a concession like that to the children of darkness.  We'll know if and when, humanly speaking, this election is over.  And for all we know, God is continuing to test us for our endurance in prayer.  I spoke weeks ago on the occasion of the Feast of the Most Holy Rosary about the battle at Lepanto.  It was a battle in which the chief weapon was not merely ships and sailors, but the Rosary.  The Holy Father called the entire church to get on its knees, including the sailors, and pray the Rosary for victory against Moslem forces, enemies, of Western civilization and Christianity who were intending to invade Italy and conquer all of Europe, destroy Christianity and Western civilization and replace it with Islam.  The Christian forces were badly outnumbered in ships and sailors and seamanship.  But they prayed and they prayed and they prayed.  And even as the Christian forces were attempting to get into formation on the seas, they had a wind that was fighting them.  They were unable to form their lines, which would have meant certain defeat.  And they continued the rosary.  And the wind changed in their favor.  And they defeated the Moslems.  destroyed their ships and the others retreated.  We need a change of winds.  We need a miracle.  And God may grant that.  But if he doesn't, we will be the better for it as children of light for having done what we could do to beg God to have mercy on our nation.  and for justice to prevail.  We have a fighter, in the best sense of a word, in the White House.  He's one of those who is at its best when the enemies are at war with him.  And he's often at his best in the last hour.  And that's what we have now.  And as long as that man, God bless him, is willing to fight For the good of our nation, for our good, we must be willing to fight with him.  Not in the manner of the children of darkness who resort immediately to violence and destruction and murder.  Out of charity and justice, we fight principally with our prayers and by other legitimate means.  So by no means have we given up.  President Trump remains our president, in my mind, until he says, if he ever does, that he is not.  I want to read to you a letter, it's lengthy, but there's nothing that I will omit from this.  It's a letter written by Archbishop Vigano to American Catholics.  He's been a great ally and friend.  The Papal Nuncio to the United States for years, a top man in the Vatican before that, who came out of comfortable retirement to expose the deep church.  Yes, there is parallel to the deep state in our nation that seeks to destroy our country, a deep church that seeks to destroy the authentic Catholic Church.  And knowing full well the consequences, he came out publicly to expose it.  And ever since, he is now in hiding for his life.  Not out of fear, but so that he can continue the good work that he is doing to expose the open church and now to expose this deep state.  Deep church, deep state.  So he deserves it.  a hearing.  Dear brothers and sisters, as devout Christians and faithful citizens of the United States of America, you have intense and heartfelt concern for the fate of your beloved country, while the final results of the presidential election are still uncertain.  News of the electoral fraud is multiplying, despite the shameful attempts of the mainstream media to censor the truth of the facts in order to give their candidate the advantage.  There are states in which the number of votes is greater than the number of voters, others in which the mail-in vote seems to be exclusively in favor of Joe Biden, others in which the counting of ballots has been suspended for no reason, or where sensational tampering has been discovered.  Always and only against President Donald J. Trump, always and only in favor of Biden.  In truth, for months now, we have been witnessing a continuous trickle of staggered news, of manipulated or censored information, of crimes that have been silenced or covered up in the face of striking evidence and irrefutable testimony.  We have seen the deep state organize itself well in advance to carry out the most colossal electoral fraud in history, in order to ensure the defeat of the man who has strenuously opposed the establishment of the new world order that is wanted by the children of darkness.  In this battle you have not failed, as is your sacred duty, to make your own contribution by taking the side of the good.  Others, enslaved by vices or blinded by infernal hatred against our Lord, have taken the side of evil.  Do not think that the children of darkness act with honesty.  Do not be scandalized if they operate with deception.  Do you perhaps believe that Satan's followers are honest, sincere, and loyal?  The Lord has warned us against the devil.  He was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in truth because there is no truth in him.  When he tells a lie, he speaks in character.  because he is a liar and the father of lies.  In these hours, while the gates of hell seem to prevail, allow me to address myself to you with an appeal, which I trust that you will respond to promptly and with generosity.  I ask you to make an act of trust in God, an act of humility and filial devotion to the Lord of armies.  I ask that all of you pray the Holy Rosary, if possible, in your families, or with your dear ones, your friends, your brothers and sisters, your colleagues, your fellow soldiers.  Pray with the abandonment of children who know how to have recourse to their most holy mother, to ask her to intercede before the throne of the divine majesty.  Pray with a sincere soul, with a pure heart, in the certainty of being heard and answered.  Ask her, she who is the help of Christians, To defeat the forces of the enemy, ask her, she who is terrible as an army set in battle array, to grant the victory to the forces of good and to inflict a humiliating defeat on the forces of evil.  Have your children pray using the holy words that you have taught them.  Those confident prayers will rise to God and will not remain unheard.  Have the elderly and sick pray so that they may offer their sufferings in union with the sufferings that our Lord suffered on the cross when he shed his precious blood for our redemption.  Have young ladies and women pray so that they turn to her who is the model of purity and motherhood.  And you men must also pray.  Your courage, your honor, and your boldness will be refreshed and strengthened.  All of you.  take up this spiritual weapon before which Satan and his minions retreat furiously because they fear the most holy virgin, she who is almighty by grace.  Do not allow yourselves to be discouraged by the deceptions of the enemy, even more so in this terrible hour in which the impudence of lying and fraud dares to challenge heaven.  Our adversaries' hours are numbered.  if you will pray.  if we will all pray with faith and with the true ardor of charity.  May the Lord grant that one single devout and faithful voice rise from your homes, your churches, and your streets.  This voice will not remain unheard because it will be the voice of a people that cries out in the moment when the storm rages most fiercely, Save us, Lord, we are perishing.  The days that await us are a precious occasion for all of you.  and for those who unite themselves spiritually to you from every part of the world.  You have the honor and privilege of being able to participate in the victory of this spiritual battle, to wield the powerful weapon of the Holy Rosary, as our fathers did at Lepanto, to repel the enemy armies.  Pray with the certainty of our Lord's promise.  Ask and it shall be given unto you.  Seek and you shall find.  Knock and the door shall be opened unto you.  The King of Kings, from whom you ask the salvation of your nation, will reward your faith.  Your testimony, remember this, will touch the heart of our Lord, multiplying the heavenly graces, which are more than ever indispensable in order to achieve victory.  May my appeal, which I address to you and to all people who recognize the Lordship of God, find you to be generous apostles and courageous witnesses of the spiritual rebirth of your beloved country, and with it, the entire world.  They shall not prevail.  In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. ",
