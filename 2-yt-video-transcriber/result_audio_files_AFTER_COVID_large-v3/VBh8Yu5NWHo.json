            "text": "I wanted to ask you, how do you see the everyday racism, racism expressed on everyday level by, let's say, normal, average people?  Again, I'm not surprised by it, but I think this is a crucial question.  One thing is to speculate about, and we all agree, big causes of racism, international constellation, global geopolitics, and so on.  But what also fascinated me is how everyday racism functions.  It's usually some... What in my psychoanalytic jargon I would have called surplus enjoyment, some tiny feature that disturbs you.  I remember the most sacred object, my own mother.  Maybe you know the story if you read some of my work.  I write about it somewhere.  My mother had an old Jewish lady with whom she was married.  good friend.  And once they had some business and then the Jewish lady left and my mother turned to me and said, you know, this is a wonderful lady friend, but did you notice the strange intense way she was counting money and so on.  I think structurally this was the same moment as the one in all those wonderful paranoiac movies like Invasion of the Body Snatcher, you know, where aliens are among us and there is some tiny feature.  They have too much skin here or a strange glow in their eyes that you recognize that they are really aliens.  Counting money too intensely was my mother's identifying feature, that that lady may appear like one of us, but it's really a Jewish alien, and so on, you know.  And everyday racism, especially in our liberal societies, is always like this.  No, okay, there are neo... the new right.  But many of my liberal friends have this more complex attitude.  I love them, the other.  Jews, Arabs, Palestinians, blacks, whoever.  But, and then comes a but.  One, and it's interesting, it would be nice to make a list of these buts, what bothers you.  One standard excuse of my racist, subtly racist friends is their food smells bad.  I just cannot stand that.  I love them, but then their music is too loud.  This was the standard complaint of white liberals, anti-racist, of course, in the United States.  Yes, we should help blacks, only if they would not be carrying those big radio boxes.  You know, this is what bothers you.  But now comes my more problematic point.  I don't think that we should hear... shift the accent to too quickly culpabilizing ordinary people.  for example recently i followed a debate in the united states where a white woman was that was the problem walking on the street and She somehow, I don't know how, did she turn around or what, noticed that there is a big strong black guy walking behind her a couple of steps, and she automatically grabbed her purse more strong.  And the black guy complained.  this was an act of racism.  Yes, I agree.  But I think it's too simple to just blame her.  You know, to blame, she's a racist and so on and so on and so on.  Because... Maybe that was her experience.  Not that she was robbed by black people, but the society she lives in and so on and so on.  And what if she then comes with statistics claiming, yes, many robberies are made by black people and so on and so on.  So I'm always distressed when something that's part a systemic problem is turned into a Moral problem for individuals.  Okay, that woman was afraid.  What should she do?  Should she reason like, oh my God, yes, we whites oppress black people, so please come and rob me.  We are guilty and so on.  And I think that we shouldn't reason at this level, but precisely, to put it in very naive Marxist terms, we should ask, but why are many black people so excluded that the only way for them is to steal a little bit?  And the problem is there.  What is pushing black people towards this?  How to change things at this level?  Because you know what really worries me?  Okay, I will give you another example to provoke you.  I have in my next book all the data about it.  Something beautiful happened, beautiful in the horrible sense for me always, at an American rich campus.  There was a swimming pool, student girls were there in their bikinis swimming, and next to the swimming pool was a building where the facade was being remade, of course by half-illegal Mexican workers, and Mexican workers behaved a little bit, not aggressively, but nonetheless, like male chauvinists, and were throwing at women this kind of, no threat, but this kind of erotic, sexist remarks.  And the women complained, They felt threatened.  And then instead of confronting the problem, you can imagine what the university authorities did.  They built under plastic a special tunnel to that building and made a big plastic wall to separate totally the two groups.  And then there was an entire conflict.  Because the ladies claimed we were victims of male aggressivity, the men claimed no, it's class distinction.  That these were rich ladies, we were too low for them, and so on.  So I think that the sad lesson that I take from it, especially in the United States where Many upper middle class feminists, they don't say it, but implicitly, when they talk about male chauvinism, it has this subtle class and race dimension.  You know it's mostly Mexicans and so on who do this and so on and so on.  And to conclude, so that we don't lose time, you know, what is for me the worst kind of racism.  I say this to provoke you.  This patronizing celebration of the other.  in relatively affluent Western white societies, we like authentic others.  You know, the others who are not corrupted the way we are.  I remember when I was young, a friend from South Africa gave me a brochure.  It was still Apartheid.  South African brochure defending Apartheid.  And the reasoning was, in a perverted way, very... multicultural.  But if we just introduce democracy in South Africa, you know all those beautiful black minorities, Hottentot, Bushman, all these wonderful cultures will be drowned into our Western corruption.  The most subtle racism today is not direct racism of.  you are less.  No, you are more.  We may be rich, but you, sorry, not you, you, let's say you are some minority, but you live much more authentic, holistic life, and so on and so on.  I have some Native American, I don't like the name.  I prefer to call them Indian, and all my Indian friends prefer this name.  They're intelligent, my friends there.  They claim... The term Native American is more racist.  You know what was the reasoning?  I'm sorry if I repeat myself, maybe you know it.  They told me, Native Americans evokes the opposition nature culture.  So we have nature, what are you?  Cultured Americans or what?  White people.  And they told me... We much prefer to be called Indians, at least our name is a monument to white men's stupidity, you know, who thought they were in India and so on.  What I admire, my Native American friends, they hate these white liberals who come there, okay, you live your authentic life, Their message was, they told me, okay, then let's exchange our roles.  Give me your LA, Los Angeles, suburb, villa, and you come to live in our city, wooden house there, and so on.  You know, what I really, this is the most hated, this white attitude of... This underprivileged group has some kind of deeper holistic authenticity and so on and so on and so on.  All the minorities I know and that's why I love them.  No, they really want to succeed on our terms in our society.  To conclude my favorite example.  I was once in New Zealand and I... encountered some Maori painters.  And first, before they knew who I am, they gave me all that bullshit, you know, you white people manipulate nature and so on, while we, before we paint a mountain, we listen to the mountain, we ask the mountain for permission to paint it, all that stuff.  Then, when I become friendly with them, They told me that nonetheless they have an agent in New York who tells them what is the latest fashion.  And then they take good care that the mountain tells them this.  At that point, the fashion was old sacred objects in ruins and some naked body.  Usually women among them.  So this is what they were doing.  And I think this wasn't a manipulation.  Did you see, sorry, I improvised a little bit to the end.  Did you see, that was the biggest lesson against racism that I heard.  Did you see an excellent Inuit, to use the old term that now it's abandoned, Eskimo, film fast runner.  A Canadian Inuit film.  It tells an old story.  An old Inuit legend.  Conflict between two groups in a tribe.  But it changes the story.  In the old myth, it's a total catastrophe.  The tribe is destroyed.  They kill each other.  In the film version, they just threw out... Not kill.  Just threw out two evil members and... It's a, in some sense, happy ending.  And then a stupid white liberal attacked the film that it's not faithful to the old legend, but it makes a Hollywood compromise, happy ending, and so on and so on.  And the director of the film, an Inuit, who unfortunately was dying of cancer, gave him the perfect answer.  He told him, no, you are a racist here.  Because he told him, this obsession with authentic culture and so on is your Western notion.  He said, it's our notion.  Inuit tradition that you retell myths, ancient myths, always in a different way, appropriating it to a present situation and so on and so on.  They don't have this myth of authenticity. ",
