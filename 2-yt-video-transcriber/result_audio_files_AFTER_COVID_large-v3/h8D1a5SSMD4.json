            "text": "I was at a place that had cable last year, two years ago, and turned on the TV, and there was Joel Osteen.  And I listened to his sermon, and I was very convicted.  Just let that sink in for a moment.  I do believe that the things he was saying were out of context and wrong.  Because when he talked about all the great things that God had in store for the people, they were more material.  You know, houses and success and jobs and all this.  Where I was greatly rebuked was this.  He was greatly encouraging, with all his heart, He really was.  He was encouraging people in the things of God, all that God had for them, but he was wrong about what was important.  Totally wrong.  But I asked myself, how encouraging am I?  How it is such a blessing to me when someone comes up to me and encourages me.  I mean, says, man, you're doing well.  Man, that was great.  You're You're progressing.  How it just jump starts me.  And I have found out it jump starts everyone else.  To be encouraged, to encourage people by pointing out... Are you ready for this?  The good in them.  Yeah, that's biblical.  God has worked good in His people.  Paul was convinced of the goodness.  of the people he was writing to.  God's done something wonderful in you.  I can see good things in you.  Look at the church in Corinth.  They're having trouble with comprehending the resurrection.  Some of them are denying physical resurrection.  Every sort of other thing going on.  But how does Paul start that letter in 1 Corinthians, talking about all the good that he saw in them?  All that the Lord had done... I just don't think, by and large, as the people of God, at least for myself, I don't do that enough.  Wow!  Brother, sister, that was amazing.  I'm so proud of God's grace in you.  So happy.  Keep going.  Press on.  Go on.  To our children.  A lot of times the only time parents talk to their children is to tell them what they've done wrong.  But to encourage them, man, you're making progress.  You're doing well.  Keep going.  You see. ",
