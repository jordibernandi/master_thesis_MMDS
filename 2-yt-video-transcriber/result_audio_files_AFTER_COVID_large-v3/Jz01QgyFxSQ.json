            "text": "Shalom again, Zion.  The name of this message, Juneteenth is a sick, perverted joke.  I said Juneteenth is a sick, perverted joke.  It makes me, you know, I don't even know where to start.  Are we really, as a people, that destroyed?  I mean, we're destroyed.  Man, do we really want a holiday?  so bad that we'll just grab anything anybody throw at us and we'll just take it like... Like not going to do not one level of kindergarten research on it.  Just, oh, this is a day for us.  First of all, have you heard the name Juneteenth?  Don't that, isn't that embarrassing to you?  Don't that make you feel like sick in your stomach when they're trying to act like you can't talk?  Juneteenth.  Instead of saying June 19th, when I was young, I asked my mom and dad about Juneteenth.  And you know what?  They didn't have an answer.  They said, well, because they weren't exactly sure what... This is my mom and daddy's answer.  They said, they weren't exactly sure what day... The news came to the people in Texas, but they knew it was in the teens.  So they just said Juneteenth.  And I grew up believing it.  I said, oh, okay, well, okay.  They didn't know exactly what day, but they knew it was in the teens.  So they just said Juneteenth.  It's in one of the teens.  And then come find out later, that's not what happened.  It's a mockery.  Mom and dad had the information wrong.  That time is a mockery.  That title is a mockery.  trying to say black people couldn't say 19 till they just said Juneteenth.  You see that?  Children at one and two years old can say 19.  And here we go.  Lighten the barbecue, cooking swine flesh.  Abomination gonna get stirred up in the kitchen.  man gonna start marching and carrying on and making speeches.  nobody is spending that energy.  i shouldn't say nobody.  the masses of this of the slumber hebrew and slumber israelites that are still sleep in the deep slumber.  they uh they can't wait to go out and spend money and time and energy on all this man-made slavery, oppression stuff.  While when it comes to the feast days of the Most High Yahuwah, the law, statutes, and commandments, slow moving.  slow to spend any money, slow to go out and get all the necessary things to do the real celebrations of the book that they carry in their hand and say they believe.  That's number one, Juneteenth.  That's embarrassing.  Makes me sick now.  to the point where it make me wanna throw up when I think about how destroyed our people are.  Number two, this idea that all of a sudden they take this racist bigot and make him this white supremacist named Abraham Lincoln, and then they trying to turn Abraham Lincoln black, and he may have been mixed, but he was a complete and utter white supremacist.  His own words.  He didn't give a damn about no slave.  He said, I want y'all to understand something.  I'm never thinking about no black person, black nigger slave becoming on left same level as us good white folk.  That's not what this is about.  I'm trying to make sure that the North retains And that the South is defeated so that there will be no succession from the union.  But I never think that black and white people should live by each other together.  Why?  Because as a racist, he said, because they will end up getting together and having some mixed race bastards, right?  Y'all look that up and see if Morey is putting a 10 on a 2.  Or did he actually say it?  And then here we go.  Here we go.  Our people so destroyed.  You know, we have a one good president.  You ain't had no good presidents.  All the presidents been bad.  What are you talking about?  I ain't got time for that.  That's the second thing.  They perpetuate a lie.  Number three.  The date is wrong.  So you got three lies and one celebration that they still pushing on our people.  And it's wrong.  Abraham Lincoln, that dirty racist dog.  Sign that paper on January the 1st.  Look it up.  And the Emancipation Proclamation did not, did you hear more, Ray?  Did not, did not, did not, did not, did not end slavery, did not abolish slavery, did not end or abolish slavery, did not end or abolish white supremacy.  Matter of fact, in his own writing, he said we must ensure, that we stay supreme.  But here we go.  Celebrating a non-freedom day, saying this was the day we got our freedom.  The word is stupid.  You know, it's such word, Juneteenth.  And Negroes just fall up under that thing like it's the thing to do.  Israel.  Israel.  Second thing is, he was a terrible person.  He was a racist.  And third, you ain't been set free from nothing.  If you think that you free, that's going to be a different video.  It means you don't understand what the word freedom means.  Talk about that in another video.  Shall we? ",
