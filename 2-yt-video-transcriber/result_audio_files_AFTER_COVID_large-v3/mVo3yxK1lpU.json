            "text": "Welcome to the Thought News Network, where we expose thoughts one headline at a time.  I have an article here entitled.  Wife gets preggo with another man's baby while on a break and wants the husband to help raise it.  Here's the article, and I quote.  Marriages are eternally complicated things and they vary from couple to couple.  Each relationship handles rough patches differently.  And for one couple on Reddit, taking a break from their marriage felt like the right step.  The man explained that on their break, they were rather lawless and had agreed that it was OK for each other to be seeing other people.  Ultimately, the pair decided that they had spent their time apart and moved back together.  just before the shelter in place orders came down.  Now, as soon as we moved back together, we talked about our experience with other people.  He explained he had a fling and she had a one night stand.  Hmm.  Think about the type of fee fail that is.  I did a video about that on Patreon.  Check it out.  Anyway, back to the article.  Quote, unfortunately, her fling happened under intoxicated circumstances and her birth control failed.  Hmm.  Excuses, excuses, excuses.  Back to the article and quote, the couple had previously decided that they were going to be child free and should never, ever get preggo.  And if so, that they would go through a termination.  So when she discovered that she became preggo from her fling, the husband says the two scheduled an appointment for the day B. Only when the time family came, she couldn't go through with it.  She apologized to me for being so stupid, but is saying that she's 100 percent sure.  He says, I've been trying so hard to convince her that she should not keep it, but she's just not having it.  She said we can raise the kid as our own.  And he says that he's not having it.  It would be hard enough if I had a kid of my own, but at least it would be mine.  This kid belonging to another man has nothing to do with me.  Now, the man who had no interest in children ever, but doesn't want to divorce, doesn't know what to do.  Should he walk away and count his losses?  People assured the husband the best thing to do would be to walk away.  The sensible answer is the only right one.  One person bluntly explained.  I understand the urge, but you should not be trying to convince her to get rid of a baby.  She won'ts.  If she does that, she'll have a disdain for you forever and your relationship will end anyway.  The truth of the matter is that you have zero desire to be a parent and it would destroy your life.  If you had fathered this child, then you would have some responsibility regardless of how you felt.  But you aren't the child's father.  Unfortunately, it sounds like he has a hard but necessary choice to make.  The husband explained that this was a mutual decision to separate in January of 2020.  In quote from the article.  So my take on this.  It's good to know that this guy thought enough of himself to say, you know what?  I am going to part ways with you.  Because I do not want to be a parent, especially not a parent to a child that isn't mine.  However, I think that he shouldn't even have gotten to that point and just ended the relationship just because she got preggo, whether she wanted to terminate it or not.  He should have said, no, thank you.  You went out there and you were reckless with the badge.  You were irresponsible and you got preggo.  So regardless whether you want to keep it or rid yourself of it, he should be out the door, especially when she got preggo.  Craggle during a one night stand.  Typical.  Ray beats, no bunny, rotten Chiquita, banana and succubi behavior.  Demanding commitment from one guy for the badge.  But not demanding a commitment from another.  One is lame and one is not in her mind.  She'll do one thing for one guy, but won't do the same for the other.  Therefore, it is wise that he excuses her from the relationship.  However, he should have did that off GP.  And the nerve of this fee fail to actually want him to take care of another man's baby.  Now, this was a rabid snow bunny.  But your succubus always ask you to do the same thing.  No, it might not be in every case that she got preggled.  Speaking of the succubus, while she was with you.  But doesn't she ask you to take care of Thuggles kids, to accept Thuggles kids, to take care of little DeMarque, to take care of little Pookie J?  Doesn't she ask you to do that?  This guy has sense enough to say no, although he should have did it before off GP.  But many of us don't have the sense not to wife up the single mommy.  I guess most guys like the fact of wiping up something used with high miles who has procreated with others.  And in some cases procreated two, three, four, five times with another, but still wants to deal and even put a baby in a. So I won't ask you guys what you think.  I know you understand that he did the right thing by saying no to raising another man's baby from getting preggo on a one night stand.  You see how low some of these creatures can go.  Goodness gracious, irresponsible to the 10th power.  And that's the thing.  If a fee fail that you deal with goes away and deals with other guys, you shouldn't allow her back.  And if you do allow her back, you should not restore her to the same position that she's had before.  Because she's dealt with other guys.  and even if she hasn't dealt with other guys, she still shouldn't have the same position because she left.  When she leaves and comes back, she can't come back and have the same status.  Just like a company, she needs to start over from the bottom if she's ever to be restored.  And it should be impossible to be restored once she has monkey dance with others.  And I'm this type of guy.  it don't matter what you did it don't matter if you monkey danced with many.  if she monkey danced with one after leaving you that should be enough to either a never allow her to return and if she does return never return with the same position.  And remember what I said in videos before.  relationships for her are just carousel breaks.  Anyway, this is why we don't date.  We recreate.  We keep it casual and occasional.  We pump and let her dump.  We catch and release.  Like the video.  Subscribe to the channel.  Hit that notification button so that you will not miss a Black Ram 313 video.
