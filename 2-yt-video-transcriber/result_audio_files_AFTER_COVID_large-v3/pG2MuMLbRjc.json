            "text": "So I'm here at the nation's capital, right here at the Washington Monument.  The Lincoln Memorial is directly in front of me.  Over here is the White House, and the capital is right behind my shoulder here.  We're here at what many people see as the center place of our republic.  So much history is all around us.  And many of you are aware of the events that took place on the 6th of January, right behind my shoulder at the US Capitol building.  So we were here in Washington, DC to observe and provide commentary for the Save America March.  There were so many people.  I mean, to my right, this was just a sea of people all the way down there towards the White House.  It was really a sight to see.  It was really quite epic.  There were a lot of people here who were concerned about injustice.  They were concerned about fraud.  Many people just very sober-minded and people concerned about the future of their nation and their communities.  People concerned about injustices.  And this place was filled with people like that.  And there was a large variety of people who were here.  People from Many different walks of life and different world views.  Many people saying things about America and talking about 1776 and the founding of our nation.  And then as many of you know, things sort of erupted and went the direction towards chaos.  People went to the Capitol and there were people there who were very peaceful, just calling into the Capitol and voicing their concerns.  And of course, you're all aware of what we saw, and that is people began to actually break into the Capitol, destroy property, pull furniture out, and it was chaos.  We want to think about how, as Christians, we're going to respond to what's happening in our nation right now.  We need to think about foundations.  There's so much history here.  I mean, you can't avoid it.  You can't in any way be at awe of the history from the Vietnam War Memorial to the World War II Memorial to the Holocaust Museum to the White House and Lincoln Memorial and Capitol.  And there's just so much history here.  And that history means something.  It gave us something.  And many of the people here the other day would profess faith in Jesus Christ, and they have in their minds an understanding of where we came from and what we've lost in many ways.  And I want to speak directly to that.  What's the most important thing for us?  And I think it should be obvious to us all at this point right now in our history that we don't need a political savior, a political messiah.  There is no salvation in the state.  There never has been.  And many people who are here have valid concerns about where we're going as a nation and injustice and fraud and lies and all the things that are wrong that all of us can see.  But the question is, how do we actually get to a place where there's any meaning in our complaints?  And I want to say that the most important thing for us to consider right now, I think we should all be in agreement on as Christians, is that the hope of our nation is Jesus.  And I know that there were people who were here, they were saying that, and they believed that, and there's people who understand that.  And in many ways, my fear is that for some, it may be nothing more than a pithy slogan, that Jesus is the answer for our nation.  Because when we really dig into what that means, we need to think back to the history of this nation, the people that gave us all these things that were wonderful and blessings, and we think about things like the Declaration of Independence, and we talk about our rights that we have in the Bill of Rights and the Constitution.  That didn't just happen from nothing.  It wasn't suspended in midair.  The real history behind it all really goes farther back than even this great American experiment.  It goes back to people that actually believed in Jesus Christ and confessed Him as Lord and understood the law of God so well that they can understand what they were pointing to.  So the people that actually gave us this tradition that brought us all these blessings, we talk about the Huguenots and the Covenanters, those pilgrims and Puritans, all those people, they had a particular worldview.  Again, it wasn't suspended in midair.  You didn't get this history by accident.  It didn't come from nothing.  There was something below it that gave rise to it.  And that was a submission to Christ's Lordship and to the Word of God as the ultimate standard in our families, in our churches, in our communities, in our states, and in our governments.  And I want to say that that, I think, is the most important thing to focus on is that the answer for our nation is in a changed heart.  And that is truly something that only Jesus can do.  A political savior can't do that.  Political messiahs can't accomplish that.  They can't change the heart of a nation.  And the nation... that we live in today has the problem of fallen hearts and broken and separated relationship with God.  Again, you don't get the glorious history of this nation without the worldview that gave rise to it.  And the worldview that gave rise to it actually says at the very, very beginning, here's the fundamental problem we all have.  Sin.  We're sinners against the true God, the only God.  There is only one God.  And God in the person of Christ came into this world to chase down rebel sinners, people who hate Him.  They love their injustice.  They love the perversions.  They love it because their hearts are fallen.  And this one and only true and living God steps down, condescends into human history, takes on flesh, represents His people perfectly in the life of righteousness and justice that they could never accomplish, and dies a death that actually we all deserve.  and He conquered our greatest enemy, death, and He rose again, and He is seated on His throne, as He says, with all authority in heaven and on earth.  And I want to say that that actually is at the bottom of the worldview that gave rise to this glorious history, that Jesus is Lord, that He's the King of kings.  We're not looking as Christians, and they weren't then for a king.  in that house over there because they understood there only is one king they would say things like no king but christ and they understood that our salvation isn't going to be found in a political order any political order or any political saviors.  it was only going to come through people who are reconciled to god through faith in jesus christ and were submitted to his lordship And that gave blood to this body that was moving and thriving and living to the degree that you even have John Jay, our first Supreme Court justice, when we were creating the court, our case law system in our country, he's pointing back to that Mosaic legislation in the law of God and quoting from the law of God explicitly.  Like the Christian worldview had actually weaved its way throughout all these things to give rise to this beautiful history and blessing.  Now listen, it wasn't a utopia.  It wasn't a utopia.  This is a fallen world.  People were sinners then, people are sinners now.  But if you think about the great blessings of this experiment and what gave rise to all this history, it came from somewhere.  The Christian worldview.  It didn't come from a worldview where we blend political salvation and political messiahs together with the Christian worldview.  It didn't come from the kind of worldview that has pictures of Jesus with a MAGA hat on.  It came from a worldview that understood that there are spheres, a sphere of government, a sphere of the church, a sphere of the state, a sphere of the family.  And they understood that God was to be over all those fears.  Which God?  The true God, Jesus Christ, that he was the ultimate.  And if we love the history of this country, If we love the great blessings that God gave to us, I think we have to understand, and I hope now we understand, that our hope, our salvation, and the source of our peace as a nation is going to come first and foremost through a nation that is on their knees before Christ and trusts in Him and acknowledges Him as the sovereign and the ultimate reference point in all areas of life.  It's going to come from a Christian populace that actually isn't afraid or ashamed to say, because God says.  Things should be this way because God says, because Jesus is Lord.  What do we want in our communities, in our states, in our nation?  We want justice and righteousness and all these things.  So the question is, where does that come from?  The answer is God's word.  But a nation, listen, a nation does not love the law of God with a heart that hates his law.  That heart has to be changed.  It has to be turned from a heart of stone to a heart of flesh.  It has to be made soft and moldable by God.  And that only comes from repentance.  You see, the call of the good news is that there is salvation and reconciliation and peace with God.  Christ is ruling in his kingdom, and you could know God through faith in Jesus, be given the gift of eternal life through faith in him.  That only comes from turning from sin to God.  to trust in Jesus Christ, and that's what our nation needs.  is salvation in Christ, a new heart.  And we need to be a nation that understands that change truly comes first on the personal level.  And then it moves away from that level to the family and then outwardly to the church and then outwardly to the state.  And so hopefully we understand that our salvation isn't going to be from the man who sits over there.  In that building.  Our salvation is going to come only through Jesus Christ and submission to Him.  And ultimately the change that takes place is going to have to take place at the local level as Christians.  At the local level.  Being brave enough, courageous enough to speak the truth of God's Word to the communities around us and to demand the establishment of justice everywhere.  that are God's standards of justice in our communities around us.  That's where the change takes place.  And it doesn't take place through breaking into buildings like this and creating chaos and disorder.  The people that were involved in the history behind all of this actually had a pretty rigorous commitment to even how you resist tyranny down to defensive postures and those sorts of things.  But that's another subject for another day.  The real foundation of what's going to bring hope from now on out is where it always has been in the first place and where it's at right now as Christians go as missionaries to countries and nations and tribes that never heard of Jesus.  The real hope and foundation of peace is a nation that is repentant before God and trusts in Him.  You see, one of the things that has really impacted me as a Christian, as a pastor, is Isaiah chapter 1.  The people of God actually were engaged in a lot of religious ritual and profession, tons of it.  And in Isaiah chapter 1, God tells them to stop.  He doesn't want it.  He doesn't want their worship.  He doesn't want their prayers.  He doesn't want any of it.  He's actually weary.  from it all he says that they're guilty.  they've got bloodstained hands.  and he says to them cease to do evil learn to do good seek justice correct oppression.  he tells them to actually care about the plight of the fatherless and the widow.  and that's where he calls them in the midst of that to actually say come let us reason together says the Lord.  and he says though your sins are as scarlet they'll be white as snow.  The answer first for the people of God is to turn back to God in repentance first.  And the seeking of establishing justice and order only comes first with a reconciled relationship with God first.  It's not the other way around.  You can't establish justice and righteousness with a rebellious relationship.  against your Creator.  So first it is reconciliation and peace with God, and then the establishment of justice.  And it only makes sense when we understand what justice and righteousness truly are.  It only comes from the law of God.  And so my call to us as believers is to number one, trust God.  Number two, trust in Christ.  And number three, establish justice according to God's law, not man's.  Thank you. ",
