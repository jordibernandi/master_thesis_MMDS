He must be between 30 and 45, financially stable, no kids, 5'10 or taller, no hookups or flings, ready to settle down, no roommates, no smoking, must love dessert, and can't be anti-sugar.  Must be honest, reliable, sweet and kind, quick-witted, romantic, must love food, must pay on the first date, no flowers on the first date, must be a social drinker, and must never wear sweatpants.

            "text": "This is Heather, and she has a list of over 50 requirements that she expects her boyfriend to have.  Now, many of the women in the audience laugh at her during this segment, but I imagine that if they were asked about their requirements, they would have a list very similar in length.  Despite her low value, Heather expects to get her perfect 10 out of 10 guy who can meet all 50 or more of her requirements.  And she wonders why she's single.  Just for comparison, I bet I can sum up what most men want in just three things.  She must be attractive, she can't be a bitch, and she must be a good housewife.  By the way, there are guys out there who will date all types of physical appearances, so this is really mostly an issue of personality.  As for Heather, let's calculate some numbers.  She wants a 10 out of 10 guy, and for the sake of argument, let's start her off as if she were a 10.  Something that is immediately noticeable is that Heather has crazy eyes, and that takes off at least two points.  Now she's an 8.  I don't know her age, but she looks very close to 30, and that knocks another point off her score.  In her requirements, she says that a man cannot be against sweets because she owns a dessert business and he must love food.  Why are those requirements?  Because she needs an excuse to get fat.  She already looks like she's gained weight and is trying to hide it.  Her dress is not form-fitting and it has a seam at her belly button which forces the fat rules down so that she doesn't get a muffin top.  Be aware that women have all kinds of tricks to hide how fat they are.  The key giveaway is the size of her arms.  That right there knocks off a minimum of one point.  Probably more in the future.  And now she's a six.  Last, she has a frosting business, which means that either she is going to be gone all the time so the kids in the home aren't going to be taken care of, or she's going to expect you to dole out the cash and float her failing business.  That's minus two points.  So she wants a guy who is a ten out of ten, when she at best is a four. ",

I can't imagine working for a control freak like her where everything about a person needs to be to her liking down to the exact detail.  Look at this.  She has four different rules on dogs.  He has to be a dog lover, but he can only adopt shelter dogs?  Geez, you're like a vegan who attacks other vegans for not being vegan enough.  People who are being managed hate it when you give them 30 different things to do.  All that's going to assure is that nothing is going to get done.  By comparison, she has more rules specifically about dogs than most men do about the entire relationship.  Is this what women consider healthy?  The way you actually manage people, and this goes for everyone, is to keep rules simple, but to pick rules that are important enough to encompass multiple things.  So when a man says he wants a woman that's attractive, what does attractive mean?  I can tell you from me that it means she can't be fat, she can't have tattoos, she can't have any weird piercings.  What does it mean to be a good housewife?  It means she has to be home.  It means she has to be able to cook.  It means she has to be able to clean.  And it means she has to be good with kids.  Those two rules and the third cover a lot of areas.  And what they do is allow the details that are unsaid to be positively interpreted by the other person.  When you give them that freedom, they often think of something better than what you thought of.  And because they thought of it, they will own it and work harder to achieve that positive thing.  By giving someone an exhaustive list, you are just saying, I am always right and I don't trust your ability to think and make decisions.  So when you treat people like that, don't be surprised that they can't think or make good decisions.  People like to discover things for themselves, which is why most people hate it when you spoil a movie.  They want mystery in how a good interaction should occur with the person they are talking to.  When you give someone a list of 50 rules, there is no room to explore.  And that's bad for both parties.  If you are a man and you follow every asinine rule on that list, then she will get bored because there's nothing about you to discover and you will get dumped.  There needs to be some mystery in what you say to people so they can figure out what you mean on their own.  If you get that right and you have provided value to the person, then they will jump to figure out how to serve you in a positive way. ",

She knows that if she has those standards, all the guys are going to pass because she doesn't have very much value as a 40-year-old overweight tattooed single mother.  When you don't have a lot of value, you can't make demands.  Her having high standards is like a minimum wage employee saying to his boss, I don't like being paid minimum wage.  If I don't get paid $50 an hour, then I'm not going to work here.  Okay, you're fired.  You aren't worth $50 an hour.  That's what she wants.  She wants a six-figure salary Romeo when at best, all she can do is be a sugar mama for a 20-year-old guy who works at McDonald's.  And it's not like she was born that way.  From how she describes herself, she was probably born attractive and then became unattractive through bad decisions that she states she is not willing to change.  She's not willing to change her huge personality.  that turns people off, and very likely, she is not willing to lose weight.  The reality is that she probably had many chances to land a guy that she says she wants, but squandered it by being high maintenance and only offering sex as a point of value.  Women who do this, this is your future.  Notice how she didn't state that she could cook or she was willing to take care of kids or anything else.  men value outside of physical attractiveness.  Don't be surprised that men only want you for your looks when that's all you bring to the table.  However, she seems to just want to blame men instead of fixing her defects.  These two women from these segments aren't looking to change.  They are looking for someone to validate their bad behavior.

You don't have high standards.  You just know exactly what you want.  You have so much to offer.  You're a businesswoman.  You're strong and intelligent.  You can have any man you want.

Do you think she's going to make any positive changes when they just validated her bad behavior?  One thing I've noticed about people who are highly valuable is that they tend to have a sense of what other people want, which makes sense because you don't build wealth or value on your own without knowing what people want.  I imagine it's because they are constantly asking themselves, what do people find valuable?  The reality is that if you are properly asking that question and you are constantly working to be the best version of yourself, then you won't have a problem finding people to be around you.  People will naturally gravitate toward you when you are being desirable.  What these chicks are looking for instead is a trick to gain the system.  How can I trick these guys into liking me without working on myself?  That doesn't work.  That's called manipulation, and even if it does work, it will always backfire because eventually the person is going to realize that you have no value.  Oh wait, this shit cares more about her dog than she does about me?  Bye.  If people don't naturally want to engage with you, they don't want to be your friend, if they aren't jumping to trust you with certain tasks or give you opportunities or listen to your ideas, it's because you aren't compelling them.  Now a part of that could be that you haven't properly placed yourself in an area where you're valuable.  That happens.  It could be that you aren't a good communicator or it could legitimately be that you don't have any value.  But that's not a big deal because you can fix all those things.  There are so many people out there who put way more effort into dancing around the problem instead of actually solving it.  We have ways to solve these things.  Start working hard.  Start thinking about what's most important to you.  Start asking people what is most important to them, and start taking criticism.  When you do that over a period of a few years, magically, people will want to be around you.  Magically, they will start listening to you, and magically, you will start attracting better people who don't act like these women from the Steve Harvey show.
