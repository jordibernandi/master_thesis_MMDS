            "text": "And in the dream, I was overwhelmed with the impossibility of seeing America turn back to God.  But in the dream, that scroll rolled down before me and I read Luke 1.17 for January 17th.  And that scripture said, and he will go on before the Lord in the spirit and power of Elijah to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the rebellious to the wisdom of the righteous.  That's what I read in the scroll.  I woke up and I knew that God was speaking to me and identifying the calling on my life and the call.  And I woke up and the Lord spoke to me.  What I'm pouring out in America is stronger than the rebellion.  If the rebellion... 20 years ago that launched the Call DC 400,000, 21 years ago, if the rebellion was strong then, I'm thinking today, in this very weekend, how strong is the rebellion right now?  If the call was part of the answer to that rebellion at that time, 21 years ago, what kind of movement is coming that's stronger than this rebellion?  I have an expectation that God was sowing seeds way back then to a time with Jezebel and Ahab, the rebellion, the throwing off of divine fetters, of morality, of free speech, the pillars of society.  If that rebellion is so strong right now, I believe for a great awakening this year like we have never seen.  Today, pray with me that God would loose 117, Luke 117, something stronger than the rebellion.  That's how I'm praying.  Father, right now, as we lift up our eyes to you, it's overwhelming in the natural what we see going on in America.  the military and all over in the in DC and the silencing of voices the not even being able to use the words mom and mother in the House of Representatives.  where have we gone?  but living God?  you've said from the very beginning that you would pour out the spirit of Elijah to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the hearts of the children to their fathers, something stronger than the rebellion.  And so we call forth the spirit of Elijah over America, a great awakening like has never been seen.  God, this year, out of the COVID year, out of the year of riots and revolution, loose an Elijah revolution, in Jesus' name, turn back the rebellion.  We ask for 80 million souls, 200,000 laborers.  You're able.  In Jesus' name, amen. ",
