            "text": "Gonna have to see how deep.  Hands out your pockets for officer safety.  So where you coming from?  And what does it make you think that you have freedom?  Well, we're getting pulled over for doing absolutely nothing wrong.  Deputies pulling us over for not doing anything wrong.  Haven't broken any laws.  Coming to your side.  Well, you're going to see.  my back is all you're going to see.  How y'all doing?  Fine.  How are you doing?  I'm good.  What's happening?  Hey, Deputy Sergeant Thickman with the Sheriff's Office.  Okay.  We can see that.  Okay.  What's your badge number?  What's that?  What's your ID number?  332.  I'm sorry.  332.  All right.  Yes, sir.  Why did we pull over?  I don't know.  Why are you pulling us over?  The lady said you were taking a picture over.  Is that against the law?  No, sir.  Then why did you pull us over?  You actually broke the law.  pulling us over because we haven't broke a law.  I'm just conducting an investigation.  No, there's no investigation unless we had a crime committed.  We haven't committed a crime, but you just turned your red lights on.  Okay, then are you allowed to take that crosswalk and drive up the road to turn in there?  Yes, sir.  We can cut across those.  Regular?  And drive up this road.  Into oncoming traffic.  Into that other road there.  Well, yes, sir.  I've come up here to make contact with you.  No, coming from that direction, coming this way, that lady in that car, whoever it was, man, woman.  turned into that turning lane, came towards us.  We were parked on the side of the road taking pictures.  And she came towards us in the on-come traffic lane.  I got it on video.  I got it on video.  But either way, you pulled us over without a reason, man.  Yeah, but see, you don't get to just make contact because you feel like it.  You don't just get to pull people over with your blue lights on because you feel like it.  We have to have broken the law.  That's the disconnect between you and me right now.  How would I have gotten you to stop?  You don't get to pull people over unless they break laws, sir.  How would I have gotten you to stop?  What reason do you have us to stop?  If I needed to make contact.  For what legal reason?  What wall do we break?  Listen, we're in public.  We're on a public road.  Taking a picture of somebody is not illegal.  That's exactly what you should have told her.  So I need to file a complaint.  I need to file a complaint against you because you don't get to just ride around pulling people over because you want to.  That's all I needed.  You don't need to know that.  you don't need to know a damn thing.  This is up.  That's fucking problem because you guys think you could just get behind them and pull them over for no reason And that pisses me off.  No you violated our rights by pulling us over without us breaking the law.  You have no right to do that.  What's going on?  Don't you understand?  You have a badge.  You have a duty to bust people.  You don't have a right to pull people over.  that haven't broke a law.  How do you not get that?  Sir, have I asked you for ID?  It don't matter.  You don't get no ID from me.  You won't get ID from me.  You don't even get to ask.  It ain't part of your job.  I don't know who y'all are anyway.  It don't matter who we are.  My point is, you think you can just drive around and pull people over for no reason.  You really believe that?  For taking a picture of somebody in public.  What you should have done was you should have addressed her, not us.  You should have told her what we did.  I asked her what was going on.  She said it's a man in a gold truck that took a picture of her.  So what?  I said I'll go make contact and see what's going on, make sure everything's okay.  Wait a minute.  You have a right to pull somebody over because you just, somebody said that they took a picture of them in public.  You believe that in your mind?  Really?  Y'all have a great day, okay?  You too.  I'll have a great day when I file my complaint for you pulling us over illegally, man.  You just don't get to pull people over because you feel like it.  That's bullshit, man.  You know it and I know it.  No, I already know your shit.  I'm the one who he fucking told get the hell out of here.  Boy, get out.  the steps, remember, in the courthouse down here?  I didn't tell you that, sir.  No, your sheriff said that to me.  I'm that guy.  I'm the guy.  You're a sheriff.  Let me say it in English this time so you can understand.  That's you, sir.  You can say whatever you want.  It don't matter.  You don't get to just pull people over for no reason, dude.  What the fuck is wrong with you, man?  Don't you know your job?  Then get your ass back in your car.  What you need to do, you should have met with us to start with, man.  This is... You don't want to go over without a reason.  When the fuck will you understand this shit? ",
