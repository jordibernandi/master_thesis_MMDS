            "text": "Beijing is also taking steps to exploit its economic leverage and the allure of their large marketplace to advance its influence over American businesses.  Beijing now requires American joint ventures that operate in China to establish what they call party organizations within their company, giving the Communist Party a voice and perhaps a veto in hiring and investment decisions.  Chinese authorities have also threatened U.S.  companies that depict Taiwan as a distinct geographic entity or that stray from Chinese policy on Tibet.  Beijing compelled Delta Airlines to publicly apologize for not calling Taiwan a province of China on its website.  And it pressured Marriott to fire a U.S.  employee who merely liked a tweet about Tibet.  And Beijing routinely demands that Hollywood portray China in a strictly positive light.  It punishes studios and producers that don't.  Beijing censors are quick to edit or outlaw movies that criticize China even in minor ways.  For the movie World War Z, they had to cut the script's mention of a virus because it originated in China.  The movie Red Dawn was digitally edited to make the villains North Korean, not Chinese.  But beyond business and entertainment, the Chinese Communist Party is also spending billions of dollars on propaganda outlets in the United States and, frankly, around the world.  China Radio International now broadcasts Beijing-friendly programs on over 30 U.S.  outlets.  many in major American cities.  The China Global Television Network reaches more than 75 million Americans, and it gets its marching orders directly from its Communist Party masters.  As China's top leader put it during a visit to the network's headquarters, and I quote, the media run by the party and the government are propaganda fronts and must have the party as their surname.  It's for those reasons and that reality that last month the Department of Justice ordered that network to register as a foreign agent.  The Communist Party has also threatened and detained the Chinese family members of American journalists who pry too deep.  And it's blocked the websites of U.S.  media organizations and made it harder for our journalists to get visas.  This happened after the New York Times published investigative reports about the wealth of some of China's leaders.  But the media isn't the only place where the Chinese Communist Party seeks to foster a culture of censorship.  The same is true across academia.  I mean, look no further than the Chinese Students and Scholars Association, of which there are more than 150 branches across America's campuses.  These groups help organize social events for some of the more than 430,000 Chinese nationals studying in the United States.  They also alert Chinese consulates and embassies when Chinese students and American schools stray from the Communist Party line.  At the University of Maryland, a Chinese student recently spoke at her graduation of what she called and I quote, the fresh air of free speech in America.  The Communist Party's official newspaper swiftly chastised her.  She became the victim of a firestorm of criticism on China's tightly controlled social media, and her family back home was harassed.  As for the university itself, its exchange program with China, one of the nation's most extensive, suddenly turned from a flood to to a trickle.  China exerts academic pressure in other ways as well.  Beijing provides generous funding to universities, think tanks, and scholars with the understanding that they will avoid ideas that the Communist Party finds dangerous or offensive.  China experts in particular know that their visas will be delayed or denied if their research contradicts Beijing's talking points.  And even scholars and groups who avoid Chinese funding are targeted by that country, as the Hudson Institute found out firsthand.  After you offered to host a speaker Beijing didn't like, your website suffered a major cyber attack originating from Shanghai.  The Hudson Institute knows better than most that the Chinese Communist Party is trying to undermine academic freedom and the freedom of speech in America today.  These and other actions taken as a whole constitute an intensifying effort to shift American public opinion and policy away from the American first leadership of President Donald Trump.  But our message to China's rulers is this.  This president will not back down. ",
