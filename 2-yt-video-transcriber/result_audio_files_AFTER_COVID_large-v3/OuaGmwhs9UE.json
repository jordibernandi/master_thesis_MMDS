            "text": "Hello there.  The Chinese tech giant Huawei is warning the UK that we need their expertise to beat this global health crisis.  Firstly, as ever, please kick that YouTube algorithm up the jacksy by giving this video a big fat like and I'm always uploading new content so please do check my YouTube channel daily.  The UK arm of the Chinese technology company Huawei has issued a public warning letter that the only way we in Britain can beat this global health crisis is by working together with Huawei.  The letter from Huawei Vice President Victor Zhang says that the company is helping to keep the UK connected during these difficult times and that when we emerge from this crisis, we look forward to continuing to play our role as a key partner in improving the networks, benefiting the economy and ultimately everyone in the UK.  And for completeness, on Victor Zhang's LinkedIn page, it says that he is in charge of Huawei's public affairs and communications strategy in the UK, including government affairs, media affairs and ecosystem relations building.  Now the reason the company felt compelled to pen this missive is because of the intense pressure that the UK government is coming under to ditch Huawei's involvement in our future 5G communications infrastructure rollout.  In January this year, prior to the onset of this health crisis, the UK government agreed to allow Huawei to provide up to 35% of the non-sensitive parts of our new 5G infrastructure, meaning that they were not to be involved in the likes of military bases and nuclear power plants.  But this was roundly condemned by many, with concerns about the close connection between the Chinese state and the inner workings of Huawei.  And to say that it also upset the US administration of Donald Trump would be an understatement.  The last thing we need, said the hawkish critics of this government's decision, is the Chinese Communist Party inserting spyware into our comms network.  And do not underestimate this threat.  Huawei is considered a leader in this field of technology.  And in a country like China, where people can sometimes mysteriously, and it seems quite openly, disappear, then you can never say that a Chinese-based company is ever truly free of communist government control.  Can you?  And the concerns amongst the UK government's own MPs are so great that 38 of them rebelled against the government and voted to end Huawei's involvement.  This rebellion was defeated, but those MPs concerned have vowed to have another go in the summer when the telecommunications bill is brought before them.  And with Beijing being seen as the source of the crisis and its handling of it coming in for so much acrimonious criticism, then the rebels might well carry the day, unless the government makes a U-turn and ditches Huawei itself first.  Hence the letter from Zhang.  But there are doves out there too, saying that Huawei is already up to its armpits in our 4G systems, and that there are other Chinese firms operating in the UK.  So what difference would 35% of non-essential 5G infrastructure make?  Especially if it's more cost-effective.  Now Huawei has been trying for ages, very unsuccessfully, to convince the world of its independence from the Chinese Communist Party.  And the New York Times reported last year that the company held a press conference to answer the question of who owned it.  And it said.  in the report, Huawei showed reporters on Thursday what it described as evidence of its independence.  A big blue book kept behind glass and under lock and key in a drab white room of the company's headquarters in Shenzhen, a southern Chinese city.  Within its ten volumes are said to be the names of all the Huawei employees who hold restricted phantom shares in the company.  Proof, the company says, that no piece of Huawei is owned by the Chinese government.  A big blue book, under lock and key, that no one can see.  Some proof.  And in his letter, Victor Zhang tries to allay our fears by saying... We have built trust in our UK business over 20 years by helping our customers, the mobile network operators, provide consumers with affordable, reliable calls and data.  Despite this, there has been groundless criticism from some about Huawei's involvement in the UK's 5G rollout, and there are those who choose to continue to attack us without presenting any evidence.  Disrupting our involvement in the 5G rollout would do Britain a disservice.  But as I've already said, where the state can disappear you, then it has ultimate control anyway.  Anyway, many in the UK have not taken kindly to what is in effect China, using what most people see as a Chinese-generated crisis, to try and push its spying agenda on us.  Conservative MP for the Isle of Wight, Bob Seeley, told the Daily Mail... It is pretty crass and tasteless that Huawei yet again is trying to use this crisis for their own ends and Chinese state ends.  It is clear there is going to be a change of opinion about China after all this and Huawei is going to be a part of that.  And he went on to say that... It is pretty crass the way it has been handing out masks.  They seem to be again trying to make politics out of this crisis.  We now hear the secret services are re-evaluating their relationship with China as well.  And he finished by saying that if we are to have open trade, then Beijing needs to be open and honest about what happens inside its own country.  And it is good news that our secret services are doing this re-evaluation, given recent events.  Now we can go around all day pointing fingers at Beijing and Huawei, but they're doing exactly what you would expect a large tech company controlled by a despotic government to do in cahoots with each other.  The company needs to maintain its UK business position, and Beijing wants to maintain its foothold inside UK tech for espionage and wider political purposes.  And writing in the Washington Examiner, Tom Rogan says that Huawei's access is crucial for China's influence and its ability to conduct espionage, but Beijing's lies have fuelled British concerns about entrusting Huawei with critical infrastructure.  And he goes on to explain that Huawei and Chinese spying are now threatened even more with being ejected from the UK because the UK public has become more aware of their deceptions.  So yes, Huawei is right to panic, he says.  And the health crisis threatens to seriously derail all of Huawei's and China's plans.  Because the decision by the government concerning Huawei has moved from a tech and security and diplomatic issue into a full-blown political issue.  And if the Tory government tries to press ahead and keep Huawei on board, it will come seriously unstuck.  because Tory MPs will find it very hard to justify a decision to reward a company controlled by the Chinese Communist Party in such a way, while risking UK security in the process.  Especially after talk of a day of reckoning for the Chinese.  The public would rightly be asking, why are you trusting them?  Why are you favouring a company controlled by a state that did not warn the rest of the world of the healthcare tsunami heading its way, and instead took full advantage of the situation?  What's going on here, they'd ask.  And the mainstream press that already has a major sad on about Boris Johnson's government would definitely be making hay on that one.  And no amount of bluster or politicking is going to make that one fly.  All that day of reckoning stuff by cabinet ministers will be revealed as nothing more than sabre-rattling if Huawei gets its contracts fully rubber-stamped by the government and parliament.  And the public outcry will yet further dampen this government's reputation, which has already been damaged by its handling of the economy and the NHS during this crisis.  So I think there will be a change of heart within government.  But it might not be a full rejection of Huawei.  Maybe a bit of scaling back for now.  But even that would be a bat-crazy decision.  But do bear in mind that Huawei is a global tech leader and employs about 1,400 people here in the UK.  And on its website it says... Huawei is nurturing UK talent to generate the next generation of technological breakthroughs.  The company has also established R&D partnerships with over 10 British universities, working together to develop cutting-edge technologies.  This includes projects with world-leading UK academic institutions, such as the universities of Cambridge, Oxford, Cardiff and Imperial College.  so the government might be tempted to keep the company on board, and therefore by default keep China on board.  How our government reacts in both the short and long term with regard to Chinese interests in the UK will give us a good insight into the trustworthiness of our politicians and the true extent of infiltration by Beijing into our halls of power.  The onus is on Huawei to provide empirical and undeniable proof that there is absolutely no connection between themselves and the Chinese government in order to legitimise a stake in Britain's communications network.  But it is more likely that I will be made President of the EU Commission than Huawei convincing the international community that it is independent of China.  So Huawei needs every friend with as many powerful connections as it can get its hands on to keep its UK 5G contract alive.  And finally, just a quick update.  The FT is reporting today that former BT chairman and president of the CBI, Mike Rake, has now joined the Huawei UK board as a non-executive director.  Reuters, though, has so far been unable to verify the story.  But TechRadar.com says that Rake has been advising Huawei since 2019 and that Huawei has strengthened its relationship with Sir Mike Rake, appointing the former BT chairman to the board of its UK business.  And that the former BT chairman has suggested that a ban on Huawei operating in our 5G project would be a considerable blow to the UK's broadband ambitions.
