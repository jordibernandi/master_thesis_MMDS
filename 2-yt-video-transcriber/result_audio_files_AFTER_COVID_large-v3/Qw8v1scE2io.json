            "text": "Who out there will argue that the African people taken from Africa placed in chains in the holds of mainly British ships and sailed to America as slaves, as beasts of burden owned by other human beings, literally owned by other human beings for whom they toiled for no wages.  They could not leave.  They were literally chained to their place as the property, just like the cattle of the white slave owners in the United States.  Who will argue that those people and their descendants have been embraced by the village?  Who, therefore, will argue that having not been embraced by the village, despite hundreds of years elapsing, despite even a black president in the White House, despite all of the so-called civil rights legislation, that the children, the heirs of those brought to America as slaves, have not been embraced by the village, who will be surprised, therefore, that some of them, with a little bit of assistance from agent provocateur, are burning the village down just to feel the warmth.  The United States, which has grown used to dispatching expeditionary forces all over the world to invade and occupy other people's countries, is now occupying its own country.  The US military is being mobilized throughout the United States from sea to shining sea, from burning city to burning city.  And its president is increasingly shrieking like an unhinged maniac.  threatening people with fierce dogs, threatening them with condign punishment for rising up against what was seen in the case of George Floyd, a case of cold-blooded murder carried out by police officers in Minneapolis.  I say officers because although the fatal knee belonged to former officer Chauvin, how appropriately named he is, the other three officers in the squad were jointly and severally responsible.  First of all, because from another angle, you can see that all four of them, were sitting upon the officer.  And in new footage you can see that all four of the officers were ruthlessly beating George Floyd inside the police cruiser.  Now, George Floyd now famously said that he could not breathe.  This was literally true, but it's also metaphorically true for the vast majority of black people in America.  It is literally true that the officer cared not that George Floyd could not breathe and was ready to squeeze the life out of him.  All over, an alleged, alleged passing of a counterfeit $20 bill.  George Floyd died suspected of passing a $20 counterfeit bill.  But it's metaphorically true, and that is even more important all across the United States.  And that's why people are rising up from Florida to Los Angeles, to Chicago, to New York City, across the Midwest, they're rising up.  against the systemic injustice being practiced not by Donald Trump.  Some idiots seem to imagine that this all began under Donald Trump.  In fact, This has been a systematic reality throughout the entire history of the United States of America.  And the aforementioned democratic president, Barack Obama, didn't only not address it, he made it far, far worse.  along with his vice president, of course, the dummy, the struck dummy, Joe Biden, whose cowardice in this current conflagration will surely damn him in the eyes of anyone with a political brain on their shoulders.  Joe Biden and Barack Obama were the reason why Black Lives Matter had to be formed.  Under Joe Biden and Barack Obama, the lives of black people in America got measurably worse, not better.  And so Donald Trump, who now protests that he loves the African Americans as if they were animals in a zoo, requiring his approbation, his petting, is only the man who inherited three years ago and a bit systematic racism, disadvantage, inequality and injustice in their country.  Now, I've said before, what happens inside the United States is a matter for the people of the United States.  And I don't resile from that view.  Of course, I have my side in the fight.  But this is the same United States that has sent its soldiers, its Air Force, its Navy, all over the world, not just throughout Europe, 97% of its history as a state, get your head around that one, 97% of the entire history of the United States of America has been spent at war somewhere or another.  And the sending of armed force, lethal force, far greater than any force being unleashed on the streets of Los Angeles this evening, is still going on.  Lethal force, either by proxy or directly, is being visited by the United States.  from Iran to Venezuela in the waters of the South China Sea.  In fact, in one of the greatest ironies in all history, as America was burning, literally, as America was burning, and cops were killing people on the streets of America, Donald Trump appeared in the Rose Garden to launch yet another series of punitive sanctions and other measures against China, the proximate cause of which was China's treatment of protesters in Hong Kong.  You really couldn't make this situation up.  And yet this country, this great giant, otherwise warm-hearted country, people of great achievement and phenomenal ability and can-do spirit, the people with whom we allied and fought some of the Second World War.  This country is being offered in November a choice between someone who's demonstrably barking mad, and someone who is demonstrably in such cognitive decline that he can barely say his name, can't be allowed out for fear that he will forget who he is, what he's running for, or where he's currently standing.  And that sums up the dilemma for the people of the United States.  A choice between Joe Biden and Donald J. Trump.  Unenviable, indeed.  Of course, in politics, you can be riding high one minute and the next minute you can be on the floor.  There are decades when nothing happens and there are weeks when decades happen.  And in the last couple of weeks, decades appear to be happening on the British political frontline.  Only two weeks ago, Boris Johnson was riding over 50% support in the opinion polls and Labour was 20 points behind.  Labour elected a man so wooden the birds are trying to nest in him.  who has said nothing, at least not until five days after events, on any of the great issues at home and abroad, and when he does, entirely misses the point, deliberately excludes the point, And yet that block of wood is now just five points, four points in some of the polls are behind Boris Johnson.  Boris Johnson has thrown it all away and it isn't over yet.  It's true that the government has four and a half years of an 80-seat majority still to run.  That's true.  But that doesn't mean Boris Johnson has four and a half years.  The men in gray suits in the Conservative Party have not missed this cataclysmic collapse in Boris Johnson's authority and seeming ability to manage the deep crisis in which Britain now finds itself.  A crisis of the coronavirus, yes, but also a crisis of the economy, a crisis of the legitimacy, of the governing elite itself.  We'll be talking to Professor Sir John Curtis, the king of all sophologists from Strathclyde University, about how this happened, how terminal it might be.  Can Boris Johnson recover?  Is Sarkir Starmer sleepwalking into Downing Street?  And if he is, what difference would it make?  I will be talking, of course, to the respected governor of Minnesota.  Governor Jesse Ventura, who many of us hoped, still hope, pray even, will run himself as a third party candidate against Trump and Biden at the presidential election in November.  But whether or not he does, he's in a peerless, unique position.  a position to describe the situation in Minnesota, having been its honorable and respected governor, and now viewing it from outside.  We'll be talking to Governor Ventura in the first hour of the show, right after Professor Sir John Curtis.  Not many television programs today had two guests of that caliber.  We'll also be talking about Julian Assange, the latest stage of whose Calvary, whose crucifixion is taking place in London, as yet another legal attempt is made to take him out of the coronavirus hellhole, otherwise known as Belmarsh Prison, a gulag if anyone ever saw one on British territory, unlike the Guantanamo Bay, which the United States illegally maintains in somebody else's country, mainly described as Cuba.  And we'll be talking at the third hour with the respected vascular surgeon and doctor.  Ranjit Brar, who since the beginning of this coronavirus crisis has talked us through the medical and medical, political and financial aspects of this story.  And we're going to stick with our moats medic right to the end of this crisis.  And I know that so many of you are interested always in what Dr.  Ranjit has to say.  And I'll be asking him because I speak as someone whose children will not be returning to school tomorrow.  My children will not be returning to school until Jacob Rees-Mogg's children return to school.  Eton is not scheduled to open until September, which tells me something.  Call me simple lad, I know I'm not educated, but I figure if it's not safe for the children of our rulers, then it ain't safe for my children either.  And I'll be asking Dr.  Ranjit, what could be coming down the pipe for us?  as hundreds of thousands of our people mass on beaches, not two feet, never mind two meters from each other.  Some of them jumping off cliffs and having to be helicoptered off the beaches by the hard-pressed ambulance service.  Parks, parks in poor areas of South London, parks like Primrose Hill in the richest areas in London.  are en masse, with no social distance, partying like it's 1999.  Are we headed for a second wave?  Seems that way to me. ",
