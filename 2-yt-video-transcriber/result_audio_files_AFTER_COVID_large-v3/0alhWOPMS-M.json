            "text": "Good afternoon, everybody.  This is Steve Fletcher with a trumpet for my people.  Today is April 20th, 2020, and we have breaking news from World Israel News.  Breaking news.  There has been a deal reached.  Gantz and Netanyahu signed unity agreement.  A government has been formed in Israel.  The agreement was reached on Monday afternoon despite reports that the talks had exploded.  Against what appeared all odds, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Blue and White Chairman Benny Gantz signed an agreement for a unity government.  The breakthrough came late Monday, shortly before the start of Yom HaShoah, Holocaust Remembrance Day.  The agreement brings to a close a political crisis that has lasted a year and a half and has led to an unprecedented three consecutive elections in Israel.  Netanyahu will serve as Prime Minister on a rotational basis.  Netanyahu will start in the role for 18 months.  Gantz will take over in October of 2021.  Netanyahu appears to have won a victory on the matter of the Judicial Selections Committee, one of key sticking points.  The Likud will have a majority on that committee, which picks judges to the Supreme Court Israel's Channel 11 reports.  Netanyahu also will have a veto over senior appointments.  The government that will emerge will include up to 36 ministers and 16 deputy ministers.  Ynet reports that Blue and White will receive the ministries for Defense, Justice, Alaya and Integration, Culture and Sports, Finance, Economy, Communications, Agriculture, Strategic Affairs, Tourism, Social Equality, and Diaspora Affairs.  The foreign ministry will be split between Blue and White and Likud, with each party running it for half the government's term.  Likud will receive the ministries of Treasury, Interior, Transportation, Housing, Education, Environmental Protection, Energy, Jerusalem Affairs, and other smaller portfolios.  The Likud will run several key committees, including Finance, Labor, and Welfare, and Immigration and Absorption.  It will also run the Constitution, Law, and Justice Committee, and the Special Committee Dealing with the Corona Crisis.  The ambassador to the UN will come from the Likud Party.  The agreement came as a surprise to most media pundits.  On Monday morning, it appeared that talks had reached a dead end after Gantz walked out on a meeting with Netanyahu.  Gantz then signaled that he would push forward with legislation targeting Netanyahu in the Knesset, a move that the Likud said would spell the end of negotiations.  The collapsing talks encouraged those members of Gantz's party who split with him over his decision to enter a unity government with Netanyahu.  Moshi Alon, a former political partner, urged him to cut off the talks.  Avigdor Lieberman of the Israel Bethuni Party tweeted earlier on Sunday, Benny Gantz, this is your moment of truth.  As someone who knows Netanyahu better than anyone, I estimate that he won't sign a coalition deal with you, not today and not tomorrow.  A deal has been reached.  Obviously, there has been a lot of negotiation that has gone into this.  A lot of planning and organizing of the committees, organizing of how they're going to be involved, how they're going to work together.  And they have a plan for Benjamin Netanyahu to be into power for the first year and a half.  And the second year and a half will be Benny Gantz.  This brings us now to the prophecy, the most interesting.  It waited for an anticipated prophecy of how the vision and prophecy of Rabbi Keduri will be fulfilled.  The Jerusalem Post An article from September 24th, 2019.  Was Netanyahu Gant's impasse predicted in mystics' hidden manuscript?  Here we're going to talk about the prophecy of Rabbi Keduri.  and how this plays into what we are watching right now.  today as the government has been formed and there has been the cancellation of the fourth elections.  They have decided to work together.  The government has been formed in Israel.  Now the question is, was Netanyahu Gantz impasse predicted in Mystic's hidden manuscript?  on the eve of the year 5780 the upcoming Hebrew year the year of corrections there will not be a government in Israel for an extended period.  Sephardic Kabbalist Rabbi Yitzhak Keduri could have predicted the political unrest surrounding recent struggles by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Blue and White leader Benny Gantz, according to a report by the Hebrew daily Israel Hayom on Sunday.  Information alluding to Keduri's predictions spread throughout social media and on the messaging application WhatsApp in recent days as well.  Keduri reportedly wrote, And he swore to Isaac a hidden book that was recently found in the Kabbalistic school of Nihilat Yitzhak that on the eve of the year 5780, the year of corrections, there will not be a government in Israel for an extended period.  And the various camps will be quarreling much without a decision on either side.  And then on Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year itself, they will fight in heaven, the holy side against the side of evil.  And God and his entourage will decide between them.  And this is all I can say.  And from here I swore not to reveal more secrets and hidden things.  The book was purportedly written by Keduri in his youth and hidden by him.  The statements by Keduri also reference excerpts from the ancient book, The Covenant of the Persimmon, by Kabbalist Rabbi Sasson Hai Shoshani, who Keduri said was known as the prophet of Egypt.  Shoshani said, There will come on the day that two ministers win the government in the land of Israel.  Both their names will be Benjamin.  and neither of them will succeed in establishing their government or kingship.  On that day, know and understand that the King Messiah already stands at the doorway, and on the Sabbath afterwards, he will come and be revealed.  Shoshani's statement continues, understand this and remember it.  So we have a unity government that has been formed.  And we have, at the same time, this ongoing process.  Over the last year, they've had three elections in Israel.  They've been unable to form a government.  The prophecy by Rabbi Keduri says that there will be two Benjamins in power trying to form a government.  They will be not successful.  But now that this process is over, they have come to an agreement to sign, to form a unity government.  This agreement has been signed, and it is done today, Monday, April 20th, 2020.  And what does the prophecy say?  On that day... Know and understand that the King Messiah already stands at the doorway and on the Sabbath afterwards he will come and be revealed.  Shoshani's statement continues.  Understand this and remember it.  So right now we are at Monday.  March or April 20th, 2020.  On the Sabbath afterwards, what is this weekend?  This weekend is the fulfillment of 73 prophetic years of Israel.  We are watching this day.  We have seen so many signs that I have been sharing about from April 29th and then looking as early as April 26th, which is the 73rd birthday of Israel in prophetic years by exact number of days.  the 73rd birthday of Israel on the prophetic calendar.  That is this coming weekend.  This is what we have been talking about.  And now the prophecy of Rabbi Keduri enters into this prophecy and this timing as today the government has been formed.  An agreement deal has been signed.  And the prophecy says that on the Sabbath day, Afterwards He will come and be revealed.  So have we reached this time?  Is this the prophecy of Rabbi Keduri that has been fulfilled and now it is pointing us directly now that the government has been formed?  Is this pointing us to this coming weekend as the time for the Messiah to be revealed?  And here we are.  And this is the most exciting report I'm able to share with you because this prophecy has been so important.  So many people have been watching the prophecy of Rabbi Keduri because of the importance of his understanding of Messiah, Yeshua is the Messiah of the Jews.  The Hebrew Messiah is Yeshua.  He revealed this at his death in a letter.  Rabbi Keduri was one of the most respected rabbis in all of Israel.  And he left a letter that he had met the Messiah and his name is Yeshua.  They did not even want to read the letter.  They did not even want to recognize this.  But he was such a prominent rabbi, so well loved, so well followed in Israel, that the people demanded that they report on this letter that he revealed, this letter that he gave at his death.  And he said, upon the year anniversary of my death, you will read this letter to the public.  And the letter came out and he revealed the name of the Jewish.  Messiah is Yeshua, Jesus Christ of Nazareth.  And now the prophecy of the government.  Time in Israel when there are elections and there are no government formed.  But when that government is formed, know this and understand on that day that the Sabbath afterwards is when the Messiah will come.  The Messiah will reveal himself.  So the prophecy was given by Rabbi Keduri.  I am sharing with you how this is all playing out.  Does this point to this coming weekend?  Does this point to the rapture of the church, the beginning of the great tribulation?  come this weekend?  April 26th, 2020.  Now, if you look in the history books on May 14th, 1948, I don't have that information right here with me prepared.  I could pause this and find it for you, but I will just leave this with you and you guys can look it up.  But when Israel became a nation on May 14th, 1948, the Declaration of Independence was was signed at midnight.  And this is a sign of the midnight hour, the sign of the fig tree, the birthday of Israel.  This generation will not pass until all of these things have been fulfilled.  And at midnight, a cry was heard.  The bridegroom is coming.  Go out to meet him.  Are we days away from the rapture of the church and the beginning of the great tribulation?  Is this prophecy speaking loud and clear that we have arrived at the time of the coming of Jesus Christ and the rapture of the bride of Christ and the beginning of the time of sorrow, the time of Jacob's trouble?  I pray you are blessed today.  I will leave the links of these two articles for you.  You can study this and search this out, especially for those who've been following and watching the prophecy of Rabbi Keduri.  This is going to be such a powerful announcement and really one of the most powerful that I've been able to bring here on my channel.
