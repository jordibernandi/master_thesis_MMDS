            "text": "I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue.  Everyone says that no one can talk to you.  And shoot somebody.  Everyone says nothing.  we show you will matter.  I wouldn't lose any voters, okay?  They say video, pictures, audio recordings, none of it matters.  When you're a star, they let you do it.  You can do anything.  But like millions of people, I keep thinking something will turn you around.  I thought children in cages would do it.  I thought Russian bounties on US soldiers would do it.  I thought 180,000 dead from a virus that could have been stopped would do it.  I was wrong.  So maybe it's not that you don't hear us.  Maybe it's just that you don't care.  We're libtards.  We're fake news.  But we live in the same neighborhoods.  We walk the same streets and our kids go to the same schools.  Let's just deal with some facts.  Mexico never paid for that wall.  It was a lie.  Trump never delivered a medical care plan to replace Obamacare.  It was a lie.  Trump promised to release his tax returns.  That was four years ago.  What the hell is in those taxes?  Just another lie.  How many times does a person have to lie to you before you stop listening to them?  17 US intelligence agencies said Russia interfered with the 2016 election.  That happened.  He holds the Bible in his hands while burning every verse in it.  Trump tells you that the press are fake news and enemy of the people so you won't believe anything they say.  But you know you can go to YouTube and watch a raw video for yourself.  Or is YouTube part of the deep state?  What happened to the Republican Party?  Ronald Reagan must be rolling over in his grave.  This is not America.  And scaring the hell out of you every day is not leadership.  It's just marketing.  On November 3rd, you can end the chaos.  You can tell your friends and family that you voted for Trump, even when you voted for Joe Biden.  Back to your service.  No one will ever know.  Think about that. ",
