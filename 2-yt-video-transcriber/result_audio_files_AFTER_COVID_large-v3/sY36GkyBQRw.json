That was the class of those songs.  now with those songs literally their career can live forever.  to quote one of their songs with noel um he isn't big in america you know and liam isn't one of the biggest stars worldwide.  this is what we have with um with the uk which we we accuse americans of being.  we see our UK prism with our celebrities as, well, this must be happening worldwide because it's happening here.  You know, it's not happening outside the UK.  You know, it's not.  If there is a secret meeting where you go and shake hands and you do a Faustian pact, I'd want more than burnage. ",

I don't go about my day and go, do you know what?  I'm thinking about Satanism today.  Well, actually maybe I do because it is a factor in, it seems to be a factor in life, right?  Maybe it, I mean, I'm trying to be careful of not, not getting lost down an alleyway, but Stephen King, you know, worked his ass off to become an author, wrote a book called Carrie, you know, worked his ass off and struggled.  He was writing in his washing room, had three kids to support or whatever.  He was a teacher, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.  Wrote a book called Carrie, clearly a satanic text or about someone who's possessed.  Bang, gets $300,000 advance, right?  J.K.  Rowling.  And again, I'm not casting aspersions here.  I'm asking questions because I'm a father and I've got to set an example for my son, you know?  So J.K.  Rowling writes a book which is, okay, it's a children's book.  We get that.  But essentially, it's about the occult.  And bang!  She's just... literally the biggest writer in the world.  you got Liam there in his interviews doing this right.  that's just fucking weird.  why would you even say that in an interview if that was even your your thing?  okay we could maybe argue sometimes we haven't always been the smartest cookie in in the book.  then you got Noel there with the owls, so that's Moloch in satanic terms in his videos.  And... ",

You know, I don't, you know, where they are concerned, I think people become poster... boys for a certain group of people that have shaped your life and whereas Liam in particular is concerned anybody that's ever bullied me at all all the way through my life a multitude of them.  I forget about them and put it onto one person and that's him.  And that's why I want to fight him.  That's why I want to fight him in the ring.  You know, he's your archetypal school boy bully that tries to intimidate because of some, um, perpetual lack of, um, self-worth basically.  And, um, look, he may have changed now.  I don't know who he is now, but, um, I still want to fight the 24 year old version of him, you know?  So that's, that's where I'm coming from with that. ",

And I saw KSI and Logan fight and just thought that looks amazing.  And I don't dislike anybody enough to actually want to train for those 10 weeks and give it my all apart from him.  So, you know, the offer still stands.  I'm still available.  Let's do it for the NHS.  I don't know why there are owls in Noel's video.  What I would say, speaking from a place of love for a fellow human, if I can overlook the aspect of, you know, feeling bullied by somebody, I'd say this about Liam.  I would say he is... well aware of the things that we are well aware of.  Not the people that do it and who they actually are or being invited into any meetings.  But I would say he's, I would say he's a white hat and not a black hat.  I might be wrong.  But my intuition says that man wants good things to happen for the planet too.  You know, it might not express it well, but from only going on intuition, I would say, you know, I would say he's a good guy.  Thank you. ",
