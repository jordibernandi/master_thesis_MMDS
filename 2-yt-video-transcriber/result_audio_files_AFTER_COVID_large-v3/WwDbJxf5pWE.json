She spent 10 years in the lab during research on animals, parasites, and parasitic diseases so prevalent in her country.  But in 1977, she left the lab and launched a program that has transformed more than the Kenyan landscape.  It was 14 years after independence and Kenya's effort to modernize and meet the needs of its growing population had virtually laid waste to Kenya's forests, eroding the soil, dwindling fuel supplies, and diminishing the country's historic beauty.  Wangari Mutai's project involved planting trees in open spaces on school grounds and along roads, setting up green belts that would not only restore the ecological balance, but would also provide income for the women who planted.  For every tree that survived three months outside the nursery, the women earned 50 cents.  Within 10 years, what had become known as the Green Belt Movement had created 600 tree nurseries, grown 10 million trees, and involved 50,000 women and children.  The effort didn't go unnoticed. ",

The government accused Muthai of having insects in her head.  Mathai's activism has increased in the face of brutal treatment and murder of government opponents, and as the international community has pressed Kenyan President Daniel Arap Moi to release his iron grip on power and legalize multi-party politics, a move he announced last December.  After raising questions about reports that the president was planning a scheme to renege on his promise, Muthai was charged with rumor mongering and must stand trial when she returns from the Rio summit.

It's no different from what we have been campaigning for in South Africa.  And so we feel that you really cannot keep those men in jail without being grossly unjust.  So we joined the mothers of these men in appealing to the Kenyan government to release them.
