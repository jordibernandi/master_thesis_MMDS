            "text": "Election day is upon us and undoubtedly there's a lot of anxiety about whether or not the polls will be correct.  That's understandable.  Americans care a lot about who wins this election.  Also in 2016, we saw a larger than average polling error in some upper Midwestern states.  Although nationally, we saw just about an average polling error.  Now, no one can tell you whether or not there's going to be a polling error this year, how big it will be, and which direction it might go in.  But for academic purposes, let's just imagine that there's a similar polling error to what we saw in 2016.  So for this, I'm going to use our handy interactive right here.  Right now, this is a hypothetical map, and it shows Biden and Trump winning in every state where they're currently leading.  Now, we should not expect that to be the actual result on Election Day because, of course, as we know, polling error happens.  So again, this is a hypothetical.  And by the way, disregard the odds here.  They're irrelevant because we've told the interactive the hypothetical outcome of every race.  Now, if there was a 2016-style error, this is what we would see change.  Iowa would go from Biden's column over to Trump's column.  We would also see that Maine's second district would go from Biden's column over to Trump's column.  And we would also see that North Carolina would go from Biden's column over to Trump's column.  Now that is still an election that Joe Biden would win, but it gets pretty close in three key states.  That means that Trump is within a half a point to a point of Joe Biden.  So if there were an even bigger polling error than there was in 2016, and it favored in the end, President Trump, we could even see Florida change.  to go into Trump's column.  Georgia also changed to go into the president's column.  And finally, Pennsylvania.  Now, this would be a bigger polling error than we saw in 2016.  But even in that scenario, Joe Biden would actually still win the election.  Now, it would be razor thin.  He would win 270 electors, which is the bare minimum of electors you would need to win the electoral college.  So that's a really close election.  It's also a very hypothetical one in which the polls are off by even more than they were in 2016.  But remember, we don't know the degree to which there will be polling error in this election.  And we don't know which way it will go either.  Just remember, Joe Biden is behind President Trump by only about a point in Texas.  So now imagine this.  Let's give the states that were originally in Biden's column back to Biden.  Now we're back to where we started.  Again, a hypothetical world in which every state where Joe Biden and Donald Trump are currently leading, they end up winning on Election Day.  But imagine this.  So in Texas, the president is only leading by about a point.  And the same goes for Ohio.  All of a sudden, if we give Texas to Biden and Ohio to Biden too, that's an overwhelming victory.  And that's not very much of a polling error in those states.  So the lesson is, yes, there could be a 2016-style polling error and Biden would still win that election.  There could be an even bigger polling error than there was in 2016, and then Biden might not win that election.  But if the polling error is in the opposite direction, he could also win in a landslide.
