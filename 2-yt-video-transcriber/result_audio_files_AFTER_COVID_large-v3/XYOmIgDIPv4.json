            "text": "Welcome back to Liberty and Finance and Reluctant Preppers.  We have a product review and this is another giveaway.  So we're going to be reviewing this tactical backpack.  This is called the Outlaw II Gear Slinger Backpack.  Made by 3V Gear.  It comes with a lifetime warranty which is extraordinary for anything these days.  and we've had a chance to put it through its paces.  First of all, just a physical inspection is going to show you that this thing is incredibly ruggedly constructed and has more compartments than you can imagine.  It has both small and multi-faceted compartments as well as a large deep inner compartment.  It's got external straps and handles on multiple sides.  It's got a deep water bottle pouch with extremely rugged top.  It's got a firm reinforced breathable air back and the construction is durable throughout.  This thing is something you're going to want to have and it can be yours for sending us an email with your name and address and phone number to libertyandfinance at gmail.com and just put the word backpack in the title.  and that can be yours.  We also had two other people.  test it out.  We had a young man who does intercity bicycle trips here, take that on a bicycle journey between different cities out here in the country and said that he was so comfortable he actually forgot that he had it on and carried all the gear and water bottles that he had to have for that trip.  We had another who's my personal trainer that we've had on here before, on our episode called Building a Stronger Prepper with Josiah Johnson.  Take a look at it.  And here was his breakdown of it.
