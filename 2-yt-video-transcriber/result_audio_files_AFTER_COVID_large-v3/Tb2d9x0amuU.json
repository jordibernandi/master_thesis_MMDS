Now, I had many subscribers who've been with me for a long time who said, hey, Nate, we'd like you to do a deeper look into this Mike Flynn thing because you're missing a whole bunch of pieces.  And I'm not going to lie, I was resistant to go into Mike Flynn even further because I... I was saying things like, hey, Mike Flynn pleaded guilty twice, and, you know, it's obvious he's guilty, and all this other stuff.  A subscriber sent me a message, and he told me I should take my own advice, look at the facts, and then come to a conclusion based on those facts.  So I did.  Mike Flynn is the former National Security Advisor to President Trump, who was accused of two things.  first lying to the fbi and then the second was acting as a foreign agent.  now simply put he pled guilty to lying to the fbi and admitting to acting as a unregistered foreign agent.  Those are just the facts.  But let me give you some background.  Michael Flynn and his business partner, Bihan Rafikian, they formed a group called the Flynn Intel Lobbying Group.  Now, Michael Flynn's son also worked with the company.  He served as his father's chief of staff.  Now, they were a lobbying group.  In the United States, if you're acting as an agent of a foreign government, you have to register under what's known as the Foreign Agent Registration Act, or FARA.  Now, the claim of the government was that the Flynn intel group was acting in the United States as an unregistered agent of a foreign government, namely the government of Turkey.  So remember the Mueller investigation?  Well, Robert Mueller and his team threatened to indict all three men in connection with failing to register.  So Mueller eventually charged both Flynn and Rafikian with violating FARA.  Now, Flynn was pressured into pleading guilty under threat that the Mueller team would also charge his son with FARA violations.  Get this.  Now, Michael Flynn's son, Flynn  Jr.,  just had a baby who was four months old when all this went down.  Michael Flynn  Sr.,  to spare his son any jail time or any criminal charges, pled guilty.  And in return for that guilty plea, Michael Flynn flipped on Rafikian.  He then turned state's evidence and agreed to testify against Rafikian and Rafikian's trial.  Now, Rafikian was offered a deal, and Rafikian He bossed out.  Rafikian said, hell no.  He's going to trial.  The charges are bullshit.  That's Rafikian.  So as part of the plea deal, Flynn agreed to testify against Rafikian.  So this is where I think the timeline is important.  Flynn pleaded guilty in December 2017, and his sentencing was delayed for him to testify against Rafikian.  Now in December 2018, Flynn's sentencing was again delayed so he could testify against Rafikian.  So Rafikian said F you to the Mueller team and he wanted his day in court.  On July 23rd, 2019, a jury convicted Rafikian.  Rafikian was convicted of conspiring to act as a foreign agent, making false statements on his foreign application and acting as an agent of a foreign government.  And to make a long story short, the evidence they had against Rafikian was really the same evidence they had against Flynn.  Now here's Legal Eagle explaining it. ",

            "text": "Now, at the same time, a Turkish national named Bijan Rafikian was a partner in the Flynn intel group.  Rafikian, Flynn, and others lobbied the US government to extradite G\u00fclen to Turkey.  And as it happens, Rafikian and a co-conspirator were later convicted in their role in plotting to covertly influence United States politicians and public opinion against G\u00fclen.  And as if this wasn't enough, Flynn and his son were allegedly offered $15 million to travel to the Poconos and kidnap G\u00fclen and extradite him to Turkey.  And a reminder why this is important, Flynn was frequently lobbying foreign governments without disclosing his activities or his pay arrangements.  And it was around the same time that despite this activity, or perhaps because of it, Donald Trump tapped Michael Flynn to be his national security advisor. ",

            "text": "Now, what Legal Eagle forgot to tell you is that this conviction was tossed out.  Rafikian was actually acquitted by a judge a couple of months later because the evidence was insufficient.  And it's surprising because this acquittal was eight months before Legal Eagle put out his video.  So now I want to read from the judge's opinion in the Rafikian trial about the evidence and the reasons why Rafikian's conviction was thrown out.  This is what the court says.  The U.S.  Constitution protects the accused against convictions except upon proof beyond reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged.  The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure 29 provides an important safeguard for criminal defendants by requiring that the court... on a defendant's motion must enter a judgment of acquittal of any offense for which the evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction.  the court goes on to say after reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution and assuming that the jury resolved all contradictions in the testimony in favor of the government the question would be Would any rational trier of fact be able to find the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt?  And in Rafikian, the court said no and acquitted Rafikian.  They said the evidence itself was legally insufficient.  Or in plain English, it was nothing but bullshit.  So the court acquitted Rafikian.  Quote from the opinion.  For the above reasons, the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to sustain either of Rafikian's convictions, and the motion for acquittal is therefore granted. ",

Him saying, you know, Robert Mueller kissed my ass, it paid off.  And he's a free man.  So at this point, Flynn pretty much got a raw deal.  The evidence was bullshit.  But we had another problem.  lying to the FBI.  Now I'm going to put you to my boy Viva's documentary series on the Flynn saga and all the wrongs that happened in Flint.  He's going to explain it better and quicker than I will.  Link right here.  But what I want to talk about instead is the role of the prosecutor.  Now, when I was a prosecutor, we were told we sought justice, not convictions.  We represent the people and the defendant is one of those people.  That's why we're looking for justice.  not convictions.  So if we as prosecutors had evidence that showed the defendant was innocent, we should give it to them, no matter what.  That's Brady v. Maryland.  So when you hear people say Brady material, that's what Brady material is.  It's evidence that shows the defendant may be guilty, or it's evidence to show the defendant is actually guilty.  But in this case, that didn't happen.  The prosecutors seem to play a game.  In federal court, the US Supreme Court has never held that a defendant who pleads guilty has the right to receive Brady evidence before he pleads guilty.  Flynn's plea agreement itself did not require the prosecutor to return over any Brady evidence before he pled guilty.  But think about this.  If you have evidence that the defendant may be innocent, why wouldn't you give it to him before he pleads guilty?  Why not show him that evidence?  That's not justice.  That's bullshit.  Now, this is especially troubling because we know innocent people plead guilty every day.  Check out this clip from a TED talk about why innocent people plead guilty. ",

Flynn should move to withdraw his guilty plea because he's the champion against government misconduct and hiding evidence that shows people were innocent.  I just knew evidence was being hidden that would have exonerated General Flynn.  I attended that hearing just to get a feel for how it was going as somebody interested in the issue.  I speak on these topics all the time.  Then when he had the sentencing hearing, I just happened to be in D.C.  and went to that.

            "text": "I want to read the opening paragraph of her letter to Attorney General William Barr about this situation.  She writes, I write on behalf of Lieutenant General Michael Flynn as a former Assistant United States Attorney for 10 years service under nine united states attorneys from both political parties.  as a lawyer dedicated to the rule of law and the firm believer in the mandate of burger v united states that the role of the united states is to seek justice not convictions.  it is my fervent hope that you and the department of justice will use this case to restore the integrity and trust in the department and reinstate the clear application of rule of law.  those words ring true now.  in the flim case brady materials weren't turned over until after flynn pleaded guilty.  now you want to see how scummy things got.  Ms.  Powell writes in her letter to the Attorney General, it would seem that the press was in league with SCO, that's the special counsel's office, to conceal the information of the struck Page Texas until Flynn entered his guilty plea.  Flynn entered his plea in open court before Judge Contreras on December 1st, who almost immediately recused himself for no disclosed reason.  And on December 2nd, the Washington Post published the article exposing struck and page had made politically charged texts disparaging trump.  so then sydney powell she goes in front of judge sullivan and says hey he wants to pull back his guilty plea.  the evidence for one of the charges that he pled guilty to was insufficient as a matter of law.  the government withheld all his brady evidence until after he pleaded guilty and currently The government is saying that they don't want to continue to prosecute him in the interest of justice and list a whole bunch of stuff that they did wrong and the reason why they want to let Flynn go.  But in some weird reason, Judge Sullivan says no.  He wants to continue on.  He makes this pearl clutching argument that what are we going to do if Flynn withdraws his guilty plea?  He's committed perjury.  The federal rules of criminal procedure have a procedure for when you withdraw guilty pleas.  Federal rules of evidence, rule 11D, withdrawing guilty pleas.  A defendant may withdraw a plea of guilty for one, A, before the court accepts the plea, for any reason or no reason at all.  So before the court accepts the plea, the defendant can withdraw it, doesn't have to give a reason.  After the court accepts the plea, but before the court imposes sentence, That's where we're at with the Flynn case.  It can happen in one of two ways.  Either A, the court rejects the plea under 11C5, which is the court rejecting a plea agreement.  Or B, the defendant can show a fair and just reason for requesting withdrawal.  Brady violations, the fact that the evidence is insufficient, and the prosecution now saying they want to drop the case in the interest of justice.  Yeah, I think those are fair and just reasons.  This is why I think Flynn's dismissal should be granted.  I think he should be able to withdraw his guilty plea.  Now, these are the reasons why I think... that at the end of the day, what's going on here with Flynn?  The government says drop the charges in the interest of justice.  They didn't turn over Brady material.  The evidence was insufficient at trial.  What more do you need to know?  And for the people out there who are arguing, Flynn pled guilty twice.  That's a silly argument.  There are people every day in every jurisdiction pleading guilty to crimes they did not do.  It's a flaw in the system.  They're not all guilty.  I want to say this.  Forgive me for my flaws.  It's a condition of my humanity.  I'll see you next time.  Peace. ",
