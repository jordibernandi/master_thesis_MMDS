But to conservatives like me who think that big government is very, very dangerous, it is like the apocalypse.  And it's not just that.  Bernie is asking a lot of voters to buy into what I consider radical ideas like the public college, the Green New Deal, Medicare for all.  He's advocating for a complete paradigm shift of the American system as we know it.  And it's a huge ask for people like me.  And it's a huge ask for a lot of people, this seismic shift from capitalism to socialism. ",

Do you know how many, what percent of American workers make less than $40,000 a year?  Almost 60%.  60% of Americans are... You can't live on that in New York.  You can't live on that in New York, and you can barely live on that anywhere.  You can't live on that if you have kids.  And I think that that reality, personally, does require a paradigm shift.  This isn't working for us.  And a $2.1 trillion tax cut, which has been deemed capitalism at its finest, doesn't work for us.  Dying... you're losing your husband because he couldn't afford insulin because big pharma cares about profits more than people as capitalism at its finest does not work for us and i think he has a hard time explaining how he's going to pay for it though.  so let's talk about how we'll pay for it because i think we need to um talk about what policies.

Conservative policies are always talked about in one year price tags.  And so our military budget increase went up by 70 to 80 billion dollars one year alone, about 100 billion dollars.  you know, since Trump started, pretty much.  It's been about $100 billion increase since Trump started.  We don't ask how he pays for that.  When we talk about big government, we don't talk about big governments interjecting themselves into the bodies of women and gender nonconforming people for antichrist policies.  I'm happy to talk about the reduction of government's role in places that I think are harmful. ",

Medicare for all.  what you do is that you take your premium and some of your health care costs right now that you give to a Blue Cross Blue Shield and Aetna whomever and you lower that number.  the average American family pays about ten thousand dollars in health care costs.  you lower that number and and it transitions over to a payroll tax and the average American gets to save tons more money.  There was a Yale study that just came out that said we could transition to Medicare for all and give two years severance to every person whose job may be risked in the transition and still save money.

            "text": "This is AOC making quick work of Meghan McCain, who tries to catch the freshman congresswoman in a bad faith attack about what else but socialism.  Now, McCain frames her question in the sense of shifting the American system from capitalism to socialism, but I would fundamentally reject the premise of that assertion, because what progressives are advocating for in this election isn't socialism, and for as many times as they repeat it, we'll refute it.  Republicans use this term as a catch-all, a boogeyman to scare Fox News viewers into thinking that we're going to devolve into Venezuela, but social programs don't mean socialism.  Because remember, we already have social programs, and you might be familiar with them considering they're the most popular programs in America.  Medicare is a social program.  Medicaid is a social program.  Social Security is a social program.  And last time I checked, I didn't see any bread lines outside.  So I can promise you that if we dare to, oh, I don't know, give Americans access to healthcare or transfer to renewable energy, it's not going to mean that we devolve into Venezuela.  It'll mean Americans have access to healthcare and that we've transitioned to renewable energy.  And of course, once the Republican argument of, it's all socialism and you should be scared of that, gets stale, they always fall back on the same question, how are we going to pay for it?  Now first off, I just have to say that it's funny to me how Republicans suddenly become fiscal conservatives again as soon as spending isn't on their priorities.  Because I'm old enough to remember Republicans absolutely blowing up the federal deficit in exchange for a tax cut for corporations and the ultra-rich.  I'm old enough to remember dumping a record hundreds of billions of dollars into military spending because Trump claimed baselessly that our military was so depleted that they didn't have any bullets.  And I'm old enough to remember federal revenue hitting barren lows as the result of those policies.  And yet despite all of that, not a peep from the fiscal conservatives.  And yet when Democrats dare to suggest that we spend money on keeping people alive, on making sure that the planet is habitable, on a quality education, well, we might as well be asking to colonize Mars.  as far as Republicans are concerned.  Because if you haven't figured it out yet, they aren't interested in what's best for the American people, they're interested in what's best for themselves, whether it's lowering their own tax rates or doing it for the corporations that donate to their reelection campaigns.  In reality, while Republicans will pretend that tax cuts and tax cuts alone are the only way forward, that couldn't be farther from the truth.  And history is proof of that.  Spending coupled with a high marginal tax rate for the rich is what has historically made this country prosperous.  The single most prosperous decades in US history were the 50s and 60s, when the marginal tax rate was as high as 92%.  And I'm not saying that the answer is a 90% marginal tax rate, but it was certainly higher than it is today.  And conversely, the point at which income inequality took off was in the 80s, under Republican hero Ronald Reagan, when he lowered the top marginal tax rate from 70% to 28%.  And I can try and convince you that Reaganomics or trickle-down economics doesn't work, that it destroyed America's middle class and exploded the wealth gap between the rich and the poor, but I don't need to because this chart does that for me.  And as for the attacks on single-payer healthcare and how we're going to pay for it, the simple fact is that we already do pay the most in the world for healthcare.  sometimes as much as 10 times more for a single drug.  In other words, the worst case scenario is that we'll pay more when we're already there.  Our current system is the worst case scenario that Republicans fearmonger about.  And so everyone screeching about how we're going to pay for it doesn't take into account that A, we already do pay the most, it's just that our money is pilfered by the middleman, by insurance companies, the top 62 CEOs of which made a combined $1.1 billion last year.  That's an average of $18 million for every CEO, while 87 million Americans are uninsured or underinsured, in case that helps put into perspective how perverse this system is in its current form.  And B, every other industrialized nation in the world has figured it out.  You're telling me that France has some secret formula that the United States can't crack?  Australia?  Canada?  The UK?  Denmark?  Sweden?  Switzerland?  Germany?  Norway?  Singapore?  Taiwan?  Ok, we have bigger populations in these countries, then split the country into regions like Canada does.  It would still allow for the best negotiated rates, as opposed to each individual American battling a profit-hungry insurance giant for the best rates.  And it's not about the quality of care.  considering Americans' healthcare quality ranks behind nearly every country with universal healthcare.  For the first time ever, Americans' life expectancies are falling.  So let's just be honest here, this isn't about some magical formula that we can't figure out.  This isn't about our size or our population or the quality of care.  This is about corporate greed.  This is about health insurance companies dumping buckets of cash into the coffers of politicians, primarily Republicans, so that they can continue to reap windfalls from the system.  profit off of our lives.  So people like Meghan McCain can pretend that progressive, compassionate policies that ensure at least a bare minimum of dignity are something to be afraid of, but the only thing to be afraid of here is the greed of a tiny number of people at the top who are hellbent on manipulating everyone else in the country, on obfuscating the facts and fearmongering and diverting our attention all so that they can continue hoarding the majority of wealth at the exclusion of everyone else.  If you ask me, that is what we should be afraid of. ",
