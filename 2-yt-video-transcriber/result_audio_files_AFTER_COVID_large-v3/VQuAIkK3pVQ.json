            "text": "This is the Dollamore Daily, and I'm Jesse Dollamore.  This video today is brought to you by Surfshark, and in just a few moments I'm going to talk about an offer exclusive to my audience.  So we are rid of Donald Trump as president.  Obviously the effects of his policies will linger on for weeks, months, possibly years relative to, or because of certain regulatory requirements, but we are rid of him.  There is one element though that we are not rid of related to Donald Trump, and that's the effects of Fox News.  Yesterday, at the very first press briefing, led by Jen Psaki, who is the new press secretary, not a queen of lies like Kayleigh McEnany or Sarah Huckabee Sanders or John Spicer, someone who has actually dedicated her life to truth and information.  And Peter Doocy, the son of Steve Doocy, even Fox news loves nepotism like the Donald Trump show.  Peter Doocy sabotaged or attempted to sabotage the very first press briefing held by the Biden administration.  It was a remarkable but expected moment.  Before we get to that, though, I want to talk about today's sponsor, Surfshark.  If you're on the internet at all, your sensitive data are at risk.

So let's get on with today's topic.  Peter Doocy, the nepotistic wonder boy.  the 33-year-old chief White House correspondent for Fox News.  His attempt was clumsy and weak is what it was.  What would you expect from someone who didn't have to earn their position in their job?  Their daddy is the host of Fox and Friends, so that's how we got the gig.  Here's the moment, and then I want to talk about it. ",

Well, he spoke today, as you all saw, about unity in his inaugural address and the importance of unity in bringing the country together and the resolve of the American people in helping to get through this moment.  We are confident, though, that Just like the American people can, the Senate can also multitask and they can do their constitutional duty while continuing to conduct the business of the American people.  And his view is that the way to bring the country together is to address the problems we're facing.  And so that means getting this COVID relief package through, having Democrats and Republicans take a serious look at that and have conversations with each other about how to move it forward.  And he's going to leave the mechanics, the timing, and the specifics of how Congress moves forward on impeachment to them. ",

Her job is to answer tough questions.  So it's not the question that bothers me.  It's the presupposition of the question.  That impeachment of Donald Trump, who incited an insurrection, is a potentially divisive thing for the country.  Is it more divisive than the actual insurrection that took place that led to the loss of life?  Peter Doocy?  Is it?  It is a ridiculous and again, clumsy, stupid thing to assume, to presume, to lay that on the very first day.  Not even to mention going into, is Biden gonna run for reelection on day one?  Just because Donald Trump filed for reelection the day he got into office doesn't mean that's the normal course of action.  Maybe it's because you don't pay attention because you don't have to pay attention because your job is guaranteed because your daddy's Steve Doocy.  Yeah, I'm beating a dead horse.  He's not qualified for his job.  Just like many others on the network.  Tucker Carlson, the trust fund wonder boy.  This is what we have to look forward to.  And let me tell you, my solemn oath to you, my audience, is that I'm not going to let Fox News get away with it this term.  They're going to be called out time after time after time.  And let me tell you, they're going to be trying their tricks because their ratings are down because now they have competition in the conservative media sphere from Newsmax, from One America News.  They're going to be trying all kinds of things to throw wrenches at into the operation of the White House press office.  It is a sickening thing to behold.  At least the last White House correspondent had a modicum of integrity.  Peter Doocy is just, I mean, he may as well work for One America News.  That's how qualified or skillful he is.  Trying to ambush John Ossoff on the campaign trail, having that blow up in his face.  If you remember this moment. ",

We have two United States senators in Georgia who have blatantly used their offices to enrich themselves.  This is beyond partisanship.  And the reason to your question that I talk so much about health and jobs and justice for all the people is that we can unite behind that program.  We've lost nine rural hospitals in Georgia in 10 years.  We can reopen them.  We can invest in infrastructure to build jobs, revitalize our communities, create opportunity, raise the minimum wage so that people doing an honest week's work can not just survive but can thrive.  And, yes, pass landmark civil rights and voting rights legislation to secure equal justice for all.  And I humbly and respectfully request the support of everyone who is tuned in on FOX right now.
