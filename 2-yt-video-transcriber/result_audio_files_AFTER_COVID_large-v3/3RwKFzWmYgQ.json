            "text": "This went on for six months.  His wife found out and he dumped me.  I was so angry and called him a cheat and a piece of ish.  I confessed everything to my husband.  He just wept and said, how could I?  How could I hurt the man I love and the children he has given me?  what's going on?  everybody?  hope everybody's feeling good.  hope everybody's doing well.  we are back with another story guys.  i will put the link to this in the description.  like usual you guys read the title.  let's get into it.  so i had an affair and recently confessed husband is blaming and isolating himself.  how to help him move forward?  hmm 42-year-old woman here have been married to my husband for 22 years.  I am not proud of what I did.  I am so disgusted how I've hurt my husband and my family.  We've had a lot of problems in our marriage over the last few years due to stress, which caused lack of intimacy, growing distant, raising children, and communication problems.  I got us into marriage counseling before my affair, but he did not want to continue, thinking there was nothing wrong with our marriage.  I was attending individual counseling while in my affair.  My counselor knew about this and told me we can't move forward until I confess.  The other man was also a part of a dead bedroom.  I met him during a yoga class.  Talking in class led to texting, which led to a full-on affair.  I was completely obsessed with him.  I often thought about him all day.  I was upset on days when I couldn't see him or he couldn't hold me in his arms.  Not exactly healthy thoughts for a married mother of three, I know.  It eventually got so bad that I would use my lunches at work to just go meet him.  he was doing everything my husband did not do told me he loved me called me beautiful romanced the heck out of me all the high school puppy love ish.  this went on for six months.  his wife found out and he dumped me.  i was so angry and called him a cheat and a piece of ish.  oh the irony.  coming from a cheating wife i know.  Now I know I was completely deserved to be thrown away like garbage.  I waited two months post-affair to confess.  I confessed everything to my husband and gave him a detailed timeline.  I explained how sorry I was and I will respect whatever decision he wants.  He just wept and said, how could I?  How could I hurt the man I love and the children he has given me?  Because I am a broken person, he is constantly asking questions about the affair, and I answer everything fully, and I don't leave out any details.  I admit it, I do love him, but our marriage has many underlying problems, and the affair was my fault.  has chosen to want to reconcile with me.  i am so thankful for another chance to be his wife.  i do love him but our bedroom was dead and the intimacy was lacking.  we have learned that he has depression which makes the fact that i had an affair even worse.  i have already told our teenage kids so they could help their father with this.  they are very upset with me as they should be.  We are in therapy together.  It has been going okay.  The problem is he constantly blames himself and says he should have been a better husband.  We had bad communication and stress from our careers, which led to a lack of intimacy.  Although I am worried, he constantly blames himself and has been isolating himself from everything.  The affair I had has destroyed his self-confidence and ego, and it pains me to see him like this.  I am worried at the lack of anger towards me.  So everyone please repent to me and give me hell.  But I am mostly looking at what I could do to help my betrayed spouse as much as I can.  To make the divorce or reconciliation easier for him.  Easier for my kids.  Help him stop blaming himself.  Help.  Wow.  Let me get my thoughts.  I can't help but notice.  Can't help but notice.  she was never ever going to confess anything to him ever because she, the, the guy, she would be the AP, his wife found out.  So he dumped her.  Notice she gets very upset when that happens.  Who was it?  He dumped, um, this went on for six months.  His wife found out and he dumped me.  I was angry and called him a cheat and a piece of ish.  Really?  Really?  You called him a piece of ish?  He was married.  You were married.  You two are having this affair behind your husband and wife's back.  You get upset because he chose his wife over you.  She was never ever going to tell her husband.  She eventually would have left her husband for him if he would have left his wife.  So now that she got dumped... Now she wants to go back to her husband and try to reconcile.  It doesn't make any sense.  You never wanted him and you still don't want him.  It sucks.  this poor guy is going through depression.  You know, I saw somebody in the comments the other day, actually, or yesterday said depression is no excuse to.  I can't remember exactly what he said.  I don't want to misquote, but it was something like depression is no excuse to.  To ignore your spouse or it was something along those lines.  Depression, I don't.  I think people who have never experienced depression don't quite understand how serious depression is.  Like depression takes over, takes over a person.  They have no control.  And I know that's probably hard to understand, but depression can cause that.  So I feel bad for him.  He's already depressed.  She cheats on him.  And he doesn't know what to do.  He's trying to make it work.  But I can tell you right now, him chasing her and saying, I can make things better.  It's all me.  It's my fault.  I can make things better.  She's eventually going to do it again.  We all know that she's going to do it again.  But man, that's very unfortunate.  Let's check out these comments.  Someone said the affair I had has destroyed his self-confidence and ego, and it pains me to see him like this.  yes cheating is the most cruel and cowardly excruciating agony you can intentionally choose to inflict on a person who trusts you the most which you did intentionally.  i am worried at the lack of anger towards me.  Get the F over yourself.  Don't go telling him how to feel.  Put some selfless giving into understanding how he actually personally feels and see what you can do to make up what all you cheated him out of.  The problem is he is constantly blaming himself and says he should have been a better husband.  We had a bad communication and stress from our careers which led to a lack of intimacy.  The thing is that you both contributed to the marriage, and sure, there are going to be areas he could improve on.  If you give him concrete things to address and make it clear you are working on changes, then you too are both working on your marriage.  Give to him.  Give and give and give to fill the massive crater you created in your marriage.  Your focus right now is on redeeming yourself by understanding your selfishness and demonstrating to your husband and your kids, props for being honest with them over and over, even when it's hard and especially when it's hard, that you are working to improve your character faults.  A woman posted and said, my husband read how to help your spouse heal from your affair.  Oh my God.  And that helped him a lot.  If you haven't read it yet, it's quite short as far as books go.  I'm sure you get through it in a couple of hours.  He is going to have an especially hard time though with the fact that he was the second choice.  Absolutely.  She responded and said, he has every right to be angry with me.  I have not seen that yet though.  I've just ordered the book off Amazon.  I wouldn't choose the other man over my husband anyway.  Not now or during the affair.  I was selfish and got angry that he dumped me like that.  Ridiculous behavior on my part.  I don't know.  I'm willing to bet if he would have said, hey, I'm going to divorce my wife.  I want to be with you.  I'm willing to bet she would have jumped on that.  She would have jumped on that deal, left her husband and the kids or just took the kids with her.  I'm willing to bet.  Someone said, oh, the anger will come when he is ready.  It's not on your timeline.  The loss of his self-esteem and confidence.  I don't know if that ever comes back.  I've never felt so messed up about myself and I don't know how to get past that.  You chose someone else over him.  There's no changing that fact for him.  You told him with your actions that he is not good enough.  Absolutely.  Someone said, if my wife had confessed her affair and gone about the aftermath as you are, we'd have a much better chance at reconciliation.  It sounds like you are doing the right thing with the terrible situations you've created by stepping out of your marriage.  Someone replied to that and said, I was lucky because I came to my wife with a pile of emails and text messages as evidence leaving her no way out.  She denied initially and walked out after 30 seconds of that and I left the house.  I came back later.  I came back later that day and she confessed everything.  And she confessed everything.  And we spent the next two weeks locked in a bedroom over Christmas break talking.  Wow.  Someone else said, you have destroyed your husband and you would still be in the affair if the other man hadn't dumped you.  Thank you.  Someone said it.  Thank you.  You've come clean, but the damage is done.  And frankly, I wonder what your motivation in coming clean was.  Was it to get back at your affair partner?  Was it to punish your husband, punish yourself, alleviate your guilt?  What I would do is honestly leave him as kindly and passionately as possible because you don't deserve him and he deserves better than you.  When you find someone better than you, you will realize all the self-doubt really is misdirected loathing that should be aimed at you.  I know because I was just like your husband.  And this is just BS misdirection and not an answer.  And I suspect your husband knows it.  How could I hurt the man I love and the children he has given me because I am a broken person?  The real answer is you wanted to have sex with the other man more than you wanted to protect your marriage and respect your husband.  That's the real answer.  And on that note, guys, I'll leave this link in the description below.  Wow, these comments.  I like these comments.  If the other guy would have never dumped her for his wife, she would have continued to do it.  Like, it's quite obvious.  It's quite obvious.  But guys, let me know what you think about this in the comments.  I'll put the link in the description like usual.  And I'll catch you guys at the next one. ",
