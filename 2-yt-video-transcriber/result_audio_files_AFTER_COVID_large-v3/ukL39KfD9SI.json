            "text": "Howdy, lieutenants and economists.  The most volatile, evil, disgusting things on the planet, humans.  If you have a video request, you can always go to assholeconsulting.com.  Yeah, I am going to charge you, kids.  And that is the importance of not fucking up.  You are such an asshole!  Abdul writes, Abdul is a repeat customer.  Abdul writes, how much do I need to pay you to make a video answering the following questions?  In your opinion, what can a relatively stupid person, let's say an IQ of less than 100, do in order to retire early and be able to travel the world?  What are the things he must not do?  I don't know what my IQ is.  An online tester in my teenage years gave me a 124 to 126 score.  That's pretty good.  An online tester in my adult years gave me 111.  That's not bad either, dude.  That's almost a full standard deviation above.  You're in the top 30, 20, 25%.  You're not dumb.  I do question the test validity, especially when I compare them to my actual life experiences.  I'm actually pretty slow.  I'd also rather account for my own stability and deal with it rather than lie to myself.  All right.  Here is, let's go through economics.  To survive in this world is so easy.  It's never been easier.  And the reason it's never been easier is because technology keeps advancing.  We have essentially created robots and a lot of people say, well, what's going to happen in an AI world?  The AI world is already here.  We already have robots.  We've had robots build and shit for quite some time.  Now you have AI kind of doing some low-level managerial decisions.  And what this does is I know everyone bitches and whines about, oh, the rich are getting richer and the poor, they're not getting poorer.  They're actually staying the same.  They're actually getting a little bit richer incrementally at a time.  But they complain that wages haven't gone up.  It's like, yeah, okay, I get it.  Wages haven't gone up, but you know what's really improved?  Let's go back to the 1950s.  Doing the research.  for poor Richard's retirement.  I'm trying to compare the cost of living in the 50s to today.  And it's not a fair comparison because the technology has improved so much.  I mean, we didn't have computers back then.  You didn't have smoke.  You had to do long distance dialing rotaries.  This is all stuff you kids don't know about.  But the cars were particularly interesting because a good car maybe got like 80,000 miles.  Maybe.  Now, a good car gets a quarter million miles.  So my point is that, yes, your wages haven't really changed all that much.  But by God, the quality and number of products sure have improved a lot.  I mean, the concept that there is this next generation, I think Gen Z, once the baby boomers die out, Gen Z won't have to commute.  I mean, unless you're a tradesman or somebody who actually has to physically be there.  The commute's going away.  We'll have telecommuting.  We have cell phones.  And yeah, it sucks.  Well, we used to be able to... I'm trying to think of something that's been taken away.  White staff.  All right, now it's replaced with a kiosk.  Yeah, it sucks.  Or the checkout.  That's another perfect one.  Let's do that.  Oregon is now kicking around legislating because this is how much fucking time leftist communist dickheads in the government have.  The Supreme Court of Oregon is actually hearing a case about... Self-checkout lanes at grocery stores.  Because it might threaten to take away a grocery clerk's job.  Oh my God, my ticker derps.  Yeah, and it freed you up to go.  do some other shit.  Like you're fighting over jobs of checking out produce.  Really?  Really?  Well, now that frees up technology, frees up resources, labor.  I don't have to pay as much.  I can make savings.  Now what do you do with the savings?  Well, that money then goes somewhere else.  Usually leisure.  And so now you could be a waiter or a waitress.  This is why retail or the service industry, that's going to be growing.  You know why?  Because people just don't want to cook their own damn food.  A lot of people become waiters, waitresses, bartenders, baristas, and there's nothing wrong with that.  You know why?  Because you actually can make a living doing it, not a fancy living.  So my point is you don't need a lot of money as a single person to make it in this world.  You really don't.  Okay, old capmeister.  40 grand.  I'm excited when I make 40 grand a year.  It's been a good year when I make 40 grand.  I got by fine.  Oh yeah, there was sacrifices.  Oh yeah, I know, I know.  But you can do it.  Now, So you don't need, you know, what do you want to do?  Well, anything that really pays like 30 grand and up and you can get by.  As long as you're not some dipshit buying cars you can't afford, majoring in dumbass fucking degrees, spending less, you can do it.  Minimalism allows you to do that.  So, you know, what jobs?  Pretty much any.  I mean, okay, now working... Babysitting, you're not going to be able to support yourself.  Oh, God almighty, they pay $20 an hour for a good babysitter.  But you as a grown man, you can't do that because it's weird.  You're not going to make a living, I'd say, working at McDonald's, these truly entry-level part-time jobs.  But hello, working security guard most of my life.  You can do it.  Driving truck, you can do it.  Yes, it helps to have a skill or a trade.  um to make a little bit more to make the budget a little bit easier a little bit of room on the top a little bit more fun.  but uh for the average individual pretty much any job would allow you to travel maybe not around the world maybe not for months at a time but you the average person working the average job with the average intelligence should have the money dry.  now here's where the problem comes in.  in this book Bachelor Pat Economics, I do believe the black man's got out of poverty as well.  I emphasize something about how to succeed in life.  The key to success, I think there's even a subtitle called Don't Fuck Up.  That's the key, okay?  Because the reason people fail is not because they didn't make enough money.  It's because they fucked up in a major regard, and it only takes one major regard.  The most common one is you have a kid you cannot afford.  If you have a kid you cannot afford, and now wifey poo or husband poo is suing you for child support or animal, and you never got married, it's an illegitimate kid, you are fucked.  There's nothing.  You fucked up, you're fucked.  And now, kiss it goodbye.  Oh, Roz, wouldn't it be wonderful if all this paperwork just blew away?  Always watching, Wazowski.  Always watching.  You're fucked.  You're one of these idiot kids that went $100,000 in debt to have a college experience to major in some fucking stupid retarded degree.  You're fucked.  You done fucked up.  You married the wrong gal or guy.  You get divorced and now you got to give them half.  You're fucked.  You bought a house you couldn't afford on an arm and then the arm resets.  You're fucked.  You bought a car on a lease and you couldn't, you didn't read it.  It was 25%.  You're fucked.  And in the case of men, that's why I talk because men, you know, us, we have a little bit more testosterone.  We get in fights because our pride was hurt or a guy was looking at our girl or whatever.  And then all of a sudden you assault somebody, criminal record, you're fucked.  Right?  The key for a single person to enjoy a good life on a minimalist income is to not fuck up.  And if you do that, you don't fuck up.  You spend less than you make.  You live minimalistically.  You don't go into debt.  The average Joe Blow can easily go travel.  Easily.  And I do mean for months at a time, globally.  Now, you have to work your way up to it.  You have to find the right work job.  Save that up.  But it is possible.  The trick is not what you major in.  Although that helps.  That helps.  As long as you don't fuck up.  It's not, do I have to get a trade?  Just don't fuck up.  And especially as a single, childless bachelor.  Bachelorettes can do it too, but women like to, they will buy.  They will spend $300 on fucking shoes.  Not multiple shoes.  One pair of shoes.  They will piss away that money.  They will do that.  Now you dude bros, you go and lease yourself a Beamer because you're idiots too.  you don't piss away your money, and you spend less than you make, and you squirrel away money for a reserve fund and a happy fund, the average person who did not fuck up with a very, very average job, even lower middle income job, I'd say, can afford themselves some travel.  Those are the key variables.  That accounts for 80% of it.  What you then do for a job, what can somebody do with an IQ of 100 or less, That is truly third place.  First, don't fuck up.  Second, spend less than you make.  Third, here's some jobs that will.  I mean, it really is that.  It really is that.  So if you cannot fuck up and spend less than you make, you've done 80% of it.  Now, to make it a lot easier, yes.  somebody working at McDonald's is going to have a much harder time saving up the money to afford a trip to Spain than somebody who is a plumber or a tradesman or something like that, or an engineer or whatever else.  So what can people with an IQ less than 100, well, how much less?  I mean, if you're 80, now you're officially mentally retarded.  And you probably don't, and then This discussion becomes moot.  I think your IQ is definitely between the 110 and 120 range, the way you're writing it.  So for your personal instances, I think, yeah, man, you know, what can not, let's just say not super geniuses, what can the average Joe do for a job?  Your average Joe, right at 100.  You could become a tradesman.  No doubt about it.  It's going to take work.  The trades aren't... Nothing's easy.  Nothing good is easy.  Nothing good is easy.  Accounting is not that hard.  It's boring.  It's not that hard.  Becoming a good mechanic.  Tedious.  Sometimes hard.  You got to... What did these... God almighty.  I just... removing the battery.  i'm looking at these gm engineers.  i'm like what in god's name did you think was going to happen to this battery like i'm removing all these straps and bolts.  i'm like this bad where you think the car would be in a rollover and it just took an hour to remove a battery.  it was insane.  um so you do need some intelligence and patience when it becomes a bm mechanic.  Oh, driving truck, CDL, not Uber.  Don't do Uber or Lyft unless you're going to do it right.  Unless you're going to do it right, which means late at night when you actually make money, you're accounting for all your operating expenses of your car.  I don't want gas costs, so I'm making money.  Security guard, night watchman.  Working for the railroad, working for the utilities company, construction, road work.  You know, I think it's kind of, we got the idea.  As long as you're not trying to figure out code or how do I patch this guy's heart up.  You know, somebody with the average IQ with training, you know, everyone thinks, well, they're average.  They're not going to be able to do it.  No, no, no.  The average person, the not average person is capable of learning.  They just have to study harder.  So if you learn some kind of skill or trade, you'll be fine.  You know, you'll, you'll now.  If you're going to rely on the union to file a lawsuit at the Supreme Court of Oregon to keep your checkout job at the grocery store, you're fucked.  You're just plain fucked.  I mean, you're not going anywhere in life.  But, frugality, minimalism, studio apartment, good used car, and then you go work... Dude, bartending, if you're a good bartender or a good waiter or a good waitress, good barista, I know we picked on you.  If you do good, you can make a living.  You can make money with tips.  you can survive and squirrel away some money.  And in this way, it's somewhat kind of cool because you don't have, I always operate from the premise, you do what you don't like to do, but that pays.  so you could be free in your life in other regards.  So everyone then goes towards the engineering, the STEM, the CPAs, not according to CPAs, military whatever else.  but if you're okay just getting by and sometimes we have this like i'm a minimalist and i have eight eight hundred thousand dollars saved up and should i get my masters it's like dude.  why are you a minimalist?  if you why are you working so hard if you're a minimalist?  so you could kind of do what you'd like?  um you know you could be a teacher.  holy shit.  you want to talk about not having a high intelligence job.  i mean the hard part about that is you got to deal with the politics you got to deal with shitty ass kids.  Um, but you want to talk about a job anybody can do and you get paid enough money and you got three months off, go be a teacher.  Uh, if you got the time or the money, you could get a master's degree and go be an adjunct, but they don't pay that much.  But again, you can, you can probably do that.  Um, yeah, I mean the world's your oyster.  So you, you got a lot more choices and options you can do.  to make ends meet and squirrel away a little bit of money.  But yeah, you're right.  Not everyone's going to be a rocket scientist.  Not everyone's going to be a biochemist.  Not everyone's going to be a CPA.  I get that.  But what a relatively stupid person could, but then you say IQ of 100.  Well, that's average.  They're not stupid.  Enabled to retire early and be able to travel the world.  Spend less than you make.  Save your money.  And don't fuck up.  And I'm not joking.  The job truly is, I mentioned, if I joined the military, I would have retired years ago.  Literally, if I joined the military fresh out of high school, because I fucked up.  I majored in stupid shit.  I went to the Carlson School of Management.  And that's not even that big of a... But I still see... This is what I say.  Go into the military.  Food, clothing, shelter, and free education.  Go.  Don't major in stupid shit.  Anybody follows that... And spendlessly.  You follow that advice, you will be way better off at 35 and I'll be at 60.  And so it is the not fucking up that will allow you to retire early and be able to travel the world.  You have to travel the world cheaply.  I mean, none of this fucking Club Med bullshit.  Um... But that's what you do in order to retire early.  You don't get people pregnant that you can't afford.  Truthfully, you don't have kids.  Oh, Catmeister got a vasectomy a long time ago because I'm like, well, the money's never coming in.  I'm barely able to support myself.  It would be a sin to bring a child into this world because I would just be a horrible provider.  You take measures.  You take action.  You guys out there, one of the best things you can do, get a vasectomy.  If you're pretty sure you're not going to have kids, you're not going to be able to afford kids, yourself a vasectomy.  It's worth it.  I mean, all you baby daddies out there, it's too late for you.  You don't get the check.  No, you got your baby mama screaming down your neck to get your, where's that check?  Oh, you're fucked.  You just fucked.  You're out of the game now.  But yeah, man, and to nail it down, I mean, for guys, it's getting in fights that would get you a criminal record or jail time, present sentence.  Um, it would be getting someone pregnant.  Um, and, and more recently it's going to be getting falsely accused of rape.  Um, and I guess there's no protection against that because anyone can falsely accuse you of it, but get your receipt, your receipts, get your, um, text messages, stuff like that.  Just you, you, you gotta play an insurance game.  You gotta play it from insurance.  You gotta play.  defense is what you gotta do.  Not often.  Yeah, go ahead.  Well, you got to play both.  You got to try and make money.  But man, you got to really just make... Hey, Bob, you want to go nightclubbing?  We're going to close down the nightclub and then go to the strip club at 3  a.m.?  Nah, mm-mm, no, mm-mm, no.  I'll hang out with you guys till midnight and I'm out.  I'm out.  Hey, you know, there's this girl Tina.  She's got big tits.  She's hot.  She's crazy, man.  She just broke up with her boyfriend.  You should totally go out.  I'm going to go to church instead.  All right, so there you go.  Just don't fuck up.  Questions, answers, assholeconsulting.com.  Get this book, Bachelor Pat Economics.  Great book.  I got the black man's god out of poverty, but it's tucked underneath all the books there too.  Abdul's black, by the way.  And the sensitive recording device is on it.  And so if I jostle it even a little bit, It will stop recording.  But there you go.  Just don't fuck up.  We'll see you guys later.  Toodles. ",
