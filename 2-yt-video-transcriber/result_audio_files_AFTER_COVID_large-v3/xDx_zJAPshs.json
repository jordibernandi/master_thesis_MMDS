            "text": "Fair enough.  So she's 21.  So what is she doing with an overweight guy that doesn't have a lot going for him?  Got a crazy video for you today.  She's not yours.  It's just your turn.  A woman should be a compliment to your life, not the focus.  Do the work.  Women do not care about your struggles.  They hang out at the finish line and they pick the winners.  Alright, what's up brothers?  We got a video request here from a guy that's asking about a younger couple that he knows where he's completely baffled by hypergamy because it defies all laws.  This is a For all intents and purposes, a 10 dating basically what looks like a five.  So let me read this to you first and then we'll hop on the road.  I watched your videos, read and loved your book.  Thanks, appreciate that.  Your work has truly changed me and I appreciate that I know all these things now.  I know a couple from high school that has always puzzled me because the man could not possibly satisfy her hypergamy.  She's attractive and intelligent.  She was in the top 20 of her year level and is currently studying at a highly renowned university.  Her partner is overweight, does not have a high paying job and is very greasy looking.  I think he works as a mechanic or something small to do with cars out of his garage.  They've been dating since I was in high school, so it's probably been five or six years now.  How does this work?  Does she choose him because she wants to be the dominant one in the relationship?  The answer is no to that, I can tell you right away.  Do you think that he is satisfying her hypergamy?  I'll deal with that in a moment.  Is there something I'm not looking at?  And here's a link to her Instagram, it should be published.  Right, so I got all that.  Let's hop on the road, I have a meeting to get to and I'm already running late.  All right, so let's deal with what hypergamy is first, because there's always some newer guys to the channel and it always requires a little bit of clarification.  I first came across the concept, I think it was about 2011 or 12, I was getting divorced and I was having a conversation with my lawyer and he said something to me along the lines of, guys always fare very, very poorly in divorce because women don't marry down.  I wasn't totally sure what he meant.  So he explained basically women only marry across and up on the socioeconomic scale, meaning your Steve from accounting, you know, the VP of the accounting department is highly likely to wife up the $40,000 a year hairdresser.  Happens fairly often.  If it's not the hairdresser, it's the girl that works at the front desk at the insurance agency.  Fill in the blank.  But women typically don't marry down, which is why they tend to do quite well in divorce.  Mackenzie Bezos was a great example of that in the last couple years.  She got half of Jeff Bezos' money, making her the richest woman in the world via divorce.  So you understand what hypergamy is.  That's basically going to clarify that.  Let me add this to it as well because a lot of guys get super confused with hypergamy and, you know, the meaning of it and, you know, what it all does.  And at the end of the day, I think Rollo explains it best when he calls hypergamy something that's not a straight jacket.  So you need to understand some of the dynamics therein.  First of all, I would look at it more like sands in an hourglass ticking down, right?  meaning there's an infinite amount of time where that relationship is likely going to run out.  Whether that's six months, six years, or 16 years, I don't know, but in most cases there's a time limit on the amount of patience that women have for guys that do not chase excellence in their life.  And of course, get lazy and fat and out of shape.  So let me just give you a little bit of a visual, like as an illustration.  as far as what this couple looks like.  From what I could gather from the Instagram link, it looks like they met in 2016.  For the most part, for every, I'm gonna say four or five pictures she's got posted running solo, there's one picture of her and her boyfriend.  She's a total dime piece, she's got curves in all the right places, very pretty face, looks like mixed Asian sort of culture.  So, you know, by all yardsticks, most of you guys out there, if you saw a picture, you'd just look at it and be like drooling, thinking this chick's a 10.  Fair enough, so she's 21.  So what is she doing with an overweight guy that doesn't have a lot going for him, that she's been with since she was about four years ago, so that would have put him around 15, 16, I would imagine, because I think she's 21, as indicated in the profile.  A lot can happen during that time.  First of all, Dude was not fat to begin with, and they were both high school students at the time, so they both didn't have a lot going on.  I mean, it's quite common for high school sweethearts to get together.  You know, they hook up, they date for a while, and then eventually, at some point, You know, one or both of them, usually the chick realizes what her sexual marketplace value is, and then she ends up bouncing on the guy.  It's not that uncommon that you see couples will be together in high school, they go to university, and then they break up, usually in university or coming out of university, usually because she bounces on him.  She finds some guy that's more of a chat than the guy that she's with.  So at this point in time, yeah, he's not very attractive.  He's definitely overweight.  He's probably pushing, like, 250, 275, maybe even close to 300.  He'll get there in no time at the trajectory that he's on.  But what I can tell you is this.  This will be a good indication that things are starting to fall apart for them.  And it'll be... You're going to see less... Posting frequencies of her and him together and more posting frequencies of her and sexy poses now.  for the most part right now There are a lot of sexy poses of this chick on her own like we're talking bikini model pictures.  She's definitely got dudes sliding into her DMS And when you look at the comments, there's a lot of like hearty faces and you're beautiful and you know for the most part It's it's from her girlfriends right now, but you're starting to see more posts from other dudes.  when you start to see All posts of just her and none of this dude anymore, that's when you know she's monkey-branching away from him.  That's when you know that she's ready to make a move, or she's making a move, or might even have already made a move.  That's just the reality of it.  Like I said, there's no... line in the sand.  it's like oh you know this this dude is is definitely done and gone for they were probably both at the smv.  uh at the same smv point when they met in 2016. he's gotten fatter.  uh as he's as school has ended she's going through university she's getting the degree.  um i don't know what she's doing but it sounds like she's chasing excellence and this guy isn't.  But at some point, she's going to come to the realization.  And for women, it's usually by 22, 23.  She's 21 right now.  So if I could bet on this relationship falling apart, knowing what I know based on the experiences that I have.  talking to all the guys, this is something that I would bet heavily on.  I'd put $100,000 down on this if this was going to fall apart.  And I'd either take double or nothing on it, honestly.  That's how confident I am in watching these things unfold.  And I've seen this happen thousands of times now.  Long story short, hypergamy is not a straight jacket.  There are instances where they get together at the same SMV, but he declines and she gets better, which is a bad, bad scene.  Like if she's gone from a seven to a 10 and he's gone from a seven to a five, there's a big spread there.  And I've always said this, is that women need to get up in the morning and look in the mirror or think to themselves.  at least, this guy's the best that I can do.  If she's getting up every day thinking you're the best that she can do, No issues whatsoever.  She's probably not going to go anywhere.  It's very unlikely.  But on a balance of probabilities, because his SMV has declined and hers has increased, the sands in the hourglass of time are ticking down.  And there is an expiration date on this particular relationship as I see it.  So I hope that answers the question on this particular dynamic because I've seen it come up a lot.  There are exceptions.  I've seen comments in some of my videos where guys or women more specifically will be, but Rich, this isn't true.  I married a guy that became a stay-at-home dad and I go to work.  blah, blah, blah, you know, insert narrative.  I can't tell a lot because I don't have any pictures of them aside from an avatar, which is usually a big, chunky, round face of a chick.  So, you know, women will have patience for the stay-at-home dad if she's out chasing excellence, making $160,000 a year, paying all the bills and not looking so hot, and he's taking care of the household.  There might be some preservation in that relationship there, but for the most part, Like my lawyer explained from day one to me, like eight, nine years ago, women marry across and up on the socioeconomic scale.  And that's all that he's seen for the most part with divorces.  He did say there was the odd case where a guy was poorer than the woman during the course of the divorce.  But he also did mention that it's because essentially he stopped chasing excellence, meaning he lost his job.  He took a lower paying job.  There was a change in the economic conditions of the household.  So Just heads up on that.  Pin in the top comment.  Do me a huge solid.  Take a look at those links.  There's links for my book.
