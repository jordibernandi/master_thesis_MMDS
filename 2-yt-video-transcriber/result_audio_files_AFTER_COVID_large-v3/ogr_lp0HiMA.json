I feel like we're in some sort of like reboot of the Bible, the Bible season 13.  We got the plague, we got locusts, we got murder hornets.  A few days ago, A firenado ripped through California.  A firenado.  I went outside of my house and an emergency signal came on warning us of flash flooding in 110 degree weather. ",

            "text": "What is happening?  Whoever's running the 2020 simulation of Earth, I would really like it if you just stop.  Thank you.  Well, okay.  So I didn't upload on time last time.  Does anyone keep track of that anymore on YouTube?  I had an interview.  It fell through.  There was a funeral.  I drove 1,600 miles.  On that 1,600-mile drive, though, I was thinking and I was like, you know what?  There's so many things that are happening, so many thoughts bouncing around my head that don't really make for great deep dive episodes of my podcast.  So I thought I'd do a little roundup of some of the things that I've found interesting or fun that I think you guys would like, too.  So.  Old school YouTube, here we come.  First up today, YouTube re-monetized Steven Crowder's channel after 14 months of being demonetized.  You guys might remember Crowder got in trouble with the internet last year for some derogatory comments about Carlos Maza, a gay journalist at Vox.  In response to the outrage, YouTube demonetized Crowder's channel and they did it under the creator influence policy.  It basically allows YouTube to demonetize or to punish channels that they see as posing a threat to the reputation of the YouTube community.  Let's just be real here, a threat to brand dollars on the platform.  They used it with Logan Paul after a suicide forest stunt.  Earlier this summer, they even invoked it against Shane Dawson for his controversial past videos that have recently come under fire for probably the 50th time.  So 14 months later, YouTube has remonetized Crowder now, and they say that he took the necessary steps to be remonetized, which is a kind of radical statement in the internet environment that we live in, where people are treated as sort of, you know, black and white, good or bad.  YouTube is saying, hey, there's actually a gray area here.  You know, it's sort of interesting because it begs the question, how much do you have to do to make good on a mistake?  Should people who cross a line be able to redeem themselves?  And if so, how?  And if you ask me, a road to redemption, a sort of compromise on these kinds of issues is really important.  I think it creates a lot more freedom in the platform.  And it also says, hey, if you make a mistake, you can come back from that.  I am a sex nerd.  that should come as no surprise to any of you at this point.  I've only made, what, 300 videos about sexuality?  Well, there was a really cool discovery recently, which is that sperm doesn't move the way that scientists have always thought it did.  For a long time, scientists thought that the sperm's tail, the little flagella, just spins in a circular motion, basically like a little propeller.  But now we know that the tail actually just whips to one side like a lopsided, awkward little fish.  The reason it still swims forward is that the body rotates, so it like flicks all the way around in a circle.  And if you're wondering what the scientific significance of this is, besides just, you know, knowing cool things about how sperm move, understanding how sperm moves could help scientists understand and address male infertility.  The late Republican politician Herman Cain died of coronavirus a few weeks ago, which is why everybody was totally shocked when he tweeted from beyond the grave.  Even in his death, Herman Cain was campaigning for Trump.  Apparently there was a tweet that went out before this one that clarified that it was going to be his team that took over the account.  It's sort of this shocking, weird reminder that, you know, whether or not you believe in an afterlife, we definitely have a digital afterlife.  A friend of mine actually had a really weird experience with this a few months ago.  There was a famous Instagrammer that died and the last post on his Instagram account was a branded post with my friend's company.  my friend starts getting all of this publicity and extra traffic.  At the time, there was nothing that he could do to get it taken down.  And it was just sort of this like weird situation.  It's definitely not something that I had thought about before.  Although the big, you know, social media platforms apparently have different processes to deal with this.  On Facebook and Instagram, a family member can convert your page to a sort of memorial account where people can or even leave their thoughts.  On YouTube, family members can request to deactivate the account.  Twitter is actually a weird one.  A family member can request to deactivate the account, but Twitter reserves the right to keep your account up anyway, essentially holding your profile hostage after you're dead.  It's a little bit morbid, yes, but I don't think it's that bad of an idea for people to think about or articulate.  What do you want to happen to your social media when you die?  Okay guys, try to wrap your head around this one.  A physicist is sounding the alarm because he says that by 2245, digital content will make up half of the Earth's mass.  Basically what this physicist is saying is that information can move between states of mass and energy, just like any other matter.  And so at some point with these massive computer farms, processing digital information, redistributing matter from physical atoms, eventually there's going to be a tipping point where there is more digital information than there are atoms on Earth.  Essentially, our world will become mostly computer simulated.  And if it seems like, you know, kind of a weird stretch, consider this.  90% of the world's data today has been created in the last 10 years.  The author of the paper, Dr.  Robson, says, essentially, we need to develop completely new technologies for data storage where information is not stored in material things.  Instead, information could be stored in non-material media like photons, vacuums, or holograms.  So while we're thinking about environmentalism and the future of energy, let's not forget how thick the Earth is getting with information.  Here's something cool.  TikTok is releasing a series of public service announcements to help people identify misinformation online. ",

Let's look at this infographic and see what's missing.  The attribution and the date are missing.  Very questionable.  Let's look at this chart.  There's a gap in the data and the link is broken.  I knew it.  This graphic is unreliable.  When you see a graphic, remember to look for attribution, check the date, and ask what info is missing.  And report accounts or content that spread false or misleading information. ",

            "text": "I think it's really cool that TikTok is trying to do something positive in this arena because it's so easy to accidentally internalize or consume false information online.  I've done it myself several times and I always feel a fool, but it's so easy to do.  Specifically, we should really think about what online media literacy looks like in schools.  If you're going to learn to read and write, you should be learning how to navigate the internet as well.  And that includes learning how to identify misinformation.  It's not necessarily going to stop like grandma from posting about the lizard people at three in the morning, but it's a starting point.  All right, guys, that's all I got for you today.  Let me know what you think of this format.  Love it, hate it.  These stories, love it, hate it.  Stay safe out there.  Don't get stuck in any firenados.  And I'll see you next time.  Bye. ",
