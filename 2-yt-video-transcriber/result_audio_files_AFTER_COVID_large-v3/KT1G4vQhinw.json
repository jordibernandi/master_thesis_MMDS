            "text": "What?  It's pretty wild.  Hey guys, your friend Spencer here.  Bethel Church in Redding, California has, man, through the years, they have told on themselves over and over and over again.  And let this be the final nail in the coffin.  And let this be the final proof that you need that this is not Christianity.  This is spiritism.  This is generic divination.  Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.  And the man who runs this is a guy named Randy Clark.  And here's his website, globalawakening.com.  You can read his bio here.  He says he is an apostle builder and the president of Global Awakening.  Now, just to show you real quick what is happening, they're having a school where they're having all these experiences.  And I want to show you what is happening here this week at this school.  What's the deal?  If you'll notice the shaking and the kriyas and all the manifestations that they're having, you'll see how sick this stuff is.  Now, you're going to see here in just a moment, you're going to see the entire crowd experiencing an impartation, is the word they use, here in just a second.  ... Thank you.  Now, ladies and gentlemen, that's disgusting is what that is.  That's demonic.  That is a group of people that are not having any gift of the Spirit given to them.  These people are basically being demon-possessed.  This is evil.  One of two things is true.  Either this video is blasphemy against the Holy Spirit or what they're doing is blasphemy against the Holy Spirit.  One of us is blaspheming God.  here in this video and I've got news for you it's not me.  and so these people are.  they've been doing this and this is what they do.  it's really scary to see this.  now.  I want you to see this.  this guy is talking about how you can find your destiny here with with this ministry.  let me just show you this on his website.  it's really set up like a business and you can fulfill your there.  it is right there you can.  you can receive power from God, then you can take a risk and fulfill your destiny.  Now, I want you to be careful about that word because in my book, Calling Evil Good the Live Christian Rock and Roll, this was the word that Beyonce Knowles and her trio, Destiny's Child, used to name their group.  Now, here's something I want you to notice.  If you go into kingjamesbible.com and you type in the word destiny.  Let's just see how many times the word destiny is found in the King James Bible.  Let's see here.  Oh, look, it is not found at all.  But let's go to the book of Isaiah in the New International Version of the Bible, and you will find the word destiny.  there look what it says in verse number 11. but as you that forsake the lord and forget my holy mountain and spread a table for furniture and fill bowls of mixed wine for destiny notice what it says here i will destine you for the sword and you will all fall in the slaughter for i called you and you did not answer.  i spoke you did not listen you did evil in my sight and chose what displeases me.  Now, I'm a King James Bible guy, and I just want to tell you that the King James Bible is the word of God for the English-speaking world.  But this right here, there is no mention of destiny in that.  But the mention of destiny, one of the mentions of destiny in the NIV, is very negative, and that's something that is not good.  So, as you see these people and their manifestations that they're having, the screaming, the yelling... And all the shaking and... I mean, really, these people are... This is not the Holy Spirit.  This is demonic manifestations these people are having.  This is scary stuff.  This should make you really nervous.  And if this is what the fruit is of the Spirit that's working in them... Okay, let me ask you a question.  And just listen to me for a second.  If that is the fruition of the Spirit that's working in them, then why would you want anything to do with that?  Why would you even think these people are Christians?  Why would you want anything to do with this music that they have?  Listen to the music.  Let's go forward a little bit.  Okay, what needs to happen with God's people is that you need to separate completely from this stuff.  You cannot dissect the music away from the manifestations that you just saw in that service.  You can't separate the two.  It's all one package.  You either take the whole thing or you take none of it.  It's just like yoga.  You cannot separate the spiritism from the stretching and the physical activity in yoga.  You just can't separate the two.  I'm sorry if you think you can, but you just can't.  And the same is with Bethel Church.  If you bring this music into your life, if you bring this music into your home, if you bring this music into your church, then you will have to eventually take the doctrine of these people at Bethel.  And like I said, these people at Bethel are not Christians.  This is not Christianity that you see being practiced here on this stage.  This is demonic religion.  It's sick.  That's disgusting.  So just keep that in mind when you're dealing with this kind of stuff.  I want to show you something in the book of Acts, chapter number 16, if you will.  Paul was starting this church at Philippi, and I want you to notice something.  In verse number 16, it says here, \"...as it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed with the spirit of divination met  us.\"  which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying.  The same followed Paul and us, crying, saying, These men are the servants of the Most High God, which show unto us the way of salvation.  And this she did many days, Paul being grieved, and turned and said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her.  And he came out the same hour.  And so they upset the soothsayers with that.  But this girl, I want you to notice her.  This girl was possessed with a spirit of divination.  and she is actually, she followed Paul around and said, these men are the servants of the Most High God, but show unto us the way of salvation.  Okay, this girl is demon-possessed, demon-possessed, and she's throwing praise unto these preachers, and she's throwing praise unto their gospel message.  I want you to think for just a moment with me.  Use your mind.  The spirit of divination, that is a generic divination, generic receiving of knowledge from a higher power.  This girl was not saved.  The Bible says she was possessed with a spirit of divination.  That's not something that went away.  okay, when America was created.  That's something that's still around even now.  And this girl was not saved.  She was possessed with a demon, a demon, a religious demon, a spirit of divination.  And as you can see, I believe that the people of Bethel Church in Redding, California, that they have not received the gospel of Christ.  These people are not born again.  These people are not truly Christians, but these people are possessed with a spirit of divination.  These people need to have whatever they're dealing with.  They need to have that cast out of them and receive the Holy Spirit, repent of their sins and trust Christ as their Savior and receive the Holy Spirit.  And that's what they need.  And what they're showing is anything but that.  These people are having strange, wild manifestations.  And I believe they can be saved, but I don't believe they are.  Now, just take into account what I'm saying from Acts 16, and then take into account what I'm showing you here in this video.  Just watch.  That's not the Holy Spirit.  That is not the Holy Spirit that you're seeing.  That is a spirit of divination.  That is a demonic manifestation.  And this right here is what they call their fire tunnel.  And if you notice the shaking, the screaming, just the... Really, that's Kundalini is what that is.  Oh, Lord, that's scary.  Now, I want to warn you guys that are out there.  I know what the music sounds like.  I know it just as good as you do.  Okay?  I know who Corey Asbury is.  I know Carrie Jobe sounds so wonderful when she sings.  And I know how this music makes you feel.  But these people are not worshiping Christ.  Satan has manifested himself as an angel of light.  They are worshiping that.  These people are not Christians.  These people have no evidence of being converted to the one who is the way, the truth, and the life.  These people are having... I believe they've been possessed by a spirit of divination.  I believe that they are possessed with a religious devil that is claiming to be the Holy Spirit, but is anything but the Holy Spirit.  Their doctrine contradicts the Word of God.  The manifestations they're having contradicts the fruit of the Spirit.  And their music and their lives are so outside the box.  And so close to the world.  Makes you wonder.  Makes you wonder.  So... When I first got started with this, most people were just like, well, you're just a legalist Pharisee.  If it's not on an upright piano and it's not whatever, then you think God's not in it.  And that's not true.  That's not true at all.  And I'm not against a new song.  I'm really not.  People say, well, you just don't like contemporary because you're one of those old footy duddies.  Yeah, I got called everything in the world.  But the truth is none of this has ever been about music.  None of this has ever been about music.  This has all been about who God is.  And you'll find that when these people worship their deity, when they sing about their deity, they're really not singing about the same one that the Bible sings about and the Bible teaches about.  And that should scare you.  Someone got on my channel a while back and said, do you ever preach the gospel in any of your... Just petty.  I said, yeah, I am preaching the gospel.  I'm dealing with this stuff.  I'm warning about false gospels.  And if you're going to preach the gospel, you have to warn about false gospels too.  And I understand where people are coming from.  I think this frustrates people so tremendously.  It frustrates them because it's almost like what they're bracing... I'm shedding the light on that and showing them it's not real.  It's not Christianity.  And that frustrates some people.  I understand that.  But I'd rather frustrate you on this side of eternity than for you to get on the other side of eternity and realize and think, I was all wrong and why didn't anybody tell me?  Well, I'm telling you.  I'm telling you now.  This is a false brand of Christianity.  This is to be avoided.  Run for the hills.  Get away from this stuff.  Get out of these churches.  And if you need my help, I'll be here to help you.  God bless you, friend.  Thank you for watching this video.  We love you guys. ",
