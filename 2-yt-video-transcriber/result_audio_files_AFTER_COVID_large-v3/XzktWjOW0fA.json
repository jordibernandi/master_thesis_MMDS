            "text": "Hey guys, just popping in to let you know that I have posted a new video.  My latest video is on bit shoot only for a variety of reasons.  I was going to make a censored version and post it here, but about 10 minutes into it and only having like two minutes of video that I could show, I just decided it's not worth it.  It's not worth it for me and it's not worth it for you.  I mean, it would be... Like it would be.  it's like it would be like the video version of the FBI declassifying a document that you really want to read and all the things that you want to see are blacked out.  It would be the same thing.  It just be the video version of that.  So rather than just frustrate the hell out of you.  I'm just letting you know on the channel here that a new video is posted.  I have the link in the description and also in the comments.  So I'm just making this video to let you guys know.  I haven't streamed in a while because my internet took a dive.  I don't know what happened.  if I have to get another SIM card or something, but the wireless internet that I was using suddenly, after working for like six months, pretty decently, started getting throttled like crazy, like down to like 2G speeds.  I can't even stream at all.  So I'm going to get that worked out so I can start doing streams again.  Definitely watch the entire video.  The video that's on BitChute, it starts out Like it's just another movie review, which isn't... That's not a bad thing, right?  Because, you know, in a way, it is.  But make sure you watch the whole thing.  There's a couple goodies at the end that you're probably not going to be expecting, so... Anyway, I might also be on Adam Green's channel this week, maybe as early as tomorrow.  This is Monday night, so maybe as early as Tuesday afternoon.  And if not, probably this week at some point in time.  But you just said you can't stream.  Yeah, I can't stream, but I can call in.  Anyway, I'll get it all straightened out.  Make sure you subscribe to me on BitChute because I did get one of my old videos about a year ago.  Or no, older than a year ago.  It's like a two-year-old video.  Here's the funny thing.  I had a video taken down.  I'm not even going to say what video it is.  It's not even that important of a video.  It's not really that relevant anymore.  But it's a video they took down once already.  Like they took it down about two years ago.  I appealed it.  They put it back up.  And then they took it down again, like last week.  And I appealed it again.  And I even said, like, look, you guys did this already.  I appealed this already.  And they said it was hate speech and took it.  And by the way, which is ridiculous.  Like if again, I'm not going to even say what it was.  It's not that important, but they should have at least gone a different route with it.  I mean, I get why they wanted to take it down, but hate speech was just a stupid reason.  But whatever.  It's YouTube, right?  So anyway, go to BitChute and make sure you subscribe to me there.  Subscribe to me at DLive and just prepare for the probable eventuality that YouTube, not just me, takes everyone you know off of their platform slowly but surely.  And if BitChute isn't a long-term solution, ",
