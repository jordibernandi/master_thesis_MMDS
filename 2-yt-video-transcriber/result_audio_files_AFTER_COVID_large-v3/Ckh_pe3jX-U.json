My dad doesn't force her to do this, of course.  She does it out of the kindness of her heart because she loves him and because she's well aware that he has a very demanding job that would be made just a little bit easier if he didn't have to drive into town during his lunch break to get his own food.

Well, at least in the US, an article from 2018 states that more millennial women are choosing to be stay-at-home moms.  And as for the stats, the most recent Pew research seems to be from 2014, which shows that the number of women who are becoming stay-at-home moms has risen.  While 71% of moms do work outside the home, 29% are staying home.  That number is up 6% from 1999.  Also, I've got to say, I absolutely love how you have the token male feminist type thrown in there in order to assure the snobby woman that yes, yes, in fact, your opinion is completely right for every single woman on earth and any woman who might disagree with you belongs in the ",

That's okay?  Look, it really doesn't affect me one way or the other.  whether or not a woman chooses to be a stay-at-home wife or mom.  That's up to them.  Some women might hate the lifestyle while others might be denied even the option due to the fact that their families can't be supported on one income.  Everyone has their own unique situations which can't always be properly judged by the outside world.  But to belittle and insult women who do choose to stay at home, or not even that, but who simply want to provide extra care to their husbands and children, is lower than low.  Once again, the feminist narrative of claiming to support all women is exposed as a pitiful lie.  The same types of competitive attitudes, the same types of jealousy and resentment that exists among many women are clearly more alive than ever.  Personally, I think the caring wife sounds like a wonderful person.  not to mention a solid model for what a lot of other women aspire to be.  She has a very lucky husband and children, and I sincerely hope that she doesn't for one second allow these jealous attacks on her to make her feel inferior.  Thank you so much for watching everyone.  I really hope you enjoyed.  Also, just as a quick note, the last several videos I've made, they've all been demonetized.  So if you would be kind enough to support my work, there are links to PayPal and Stripe in the description of this video.  Thank you once again for watching and I'll see you next time. ",
