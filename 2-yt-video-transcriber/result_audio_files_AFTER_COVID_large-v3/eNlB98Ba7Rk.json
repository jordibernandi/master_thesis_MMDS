            "text": "Now, as you can tell by that, Owen is proper salty, isn't it?  He's also heavily involved in identity politics, which leads me on to this story.  Quite nicely.  I thought I'd highlight just how insane Owen Jones is.  But let's continue.  Secondly, Labour report spells disaster.  Spells disaster?  They've been doomed since the abandoned workers for BAME.  Stupid move.  Should have championed both.  Now they get what they deserve, in my opinion.  To hold one group above another is abhorrent, in my opinion.  Identity politics will be Labour Party's downfall.  And mark my words, it will be us working class they'll blame, not the champagne socialists like Ash Showin and James.  Anyway, let's read.  The Labour Party has been told it is a mountain to climb to get back into power in the next five years.  In a damning report that lays bare the crumbling of the opposition under Jeremy Corbyn and the huge challenge facing Sir Keir Starmer.  Now, I actually beg to differ on that.  It wasn't Jeremy Corbyn that did this.  They were actually losing the vote before Jeremy Corbyn.  But anyway, I digress, we'll continue.  Mr Corbyn led Labour to its worst general election result in recent history in December, disastrously failing to take advantage of a Conservative government in crisis.  Yeah, they were in serious crisis and they still got tated.  I wonder why that is.  I'll tell you why.  It's because the Labour Party are Marxists and the Labour Party influencers are all self-confessed communists.  UK will never succumb to Marxism or Communism.  End of story.  If they continue to talk about either of them, they will lose forever.  In my opinion, but let me know what you think.  Would you vote for a Marxist government?  Because I know I wouldn't.  From a change of leader and Prime Minister and the increasing struggles to get Brexit over the line.  The crushing loss handed Boris Johnson and the Tories a massive 80-seat majority in the House of Commons.  And he's done absolutely nothing with it, has he?  Providing it with unrivalled power for any crunch votes to take place in the UK Parliament.  The humiliating defeat saw Labour lose several of its traditional heartlands, particularly in the north of England, which it had held and relied on for several decades.  And that was the problem that Labour had.  They relied on it.  They didn't campaign for us.  They didn't help us in any way.  They didn't champion any of our causes.  They just expected us to vote for them.  Well, that's not happening anymore, is it?  A lot of people up north have been woken up to just how disgraceful Labour have been in control of the north.  They have done absolutely nothing for us.  If you think that that's wrong... I'll be glad to hear you, but I will always debate otherwise.  Labour are no good for the North, and they never have been.  They're no good for the working class anymore either.  Mr Corbyn subsequently announced his resignation as leader after nearly five years in charge, with former shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir elected in his place, which didn't do Labour any favours, in my opinion.  I mean, he does all right talking.  But he's not got his own opinions, has he?  He's a fence-sitter, is Sir Keir Starmer.  Why do you think their Brexit plan did so badly?  That's right, fence-sitting Keir Starmer.  He was the one that came up with the Brexit plan to negotiate for a deal and then campaign against it.  Yeah, this is the man, the same man.  This guy has not got his own opinion.  He does what people tell him to do.  Maybe that's why he got voted in, eh?  I wonder who it is that's actually pulling the strings.  Sir Kay.  Now a major report looking at the disastrous general election defeat has laid out the huge task ahead of Sir Kay.  warning the party will not win unless urgent and immediate changes to its culture and foundations are made which basically means marxism will not be voted in.  that's a report saying that if you continue to go down the communism marxism route we will never ever win.  maybe this is uh a kick up the ass that they actually need.  because don't get me wrong everyone i don't like labor i never have done but I don't like having one party in complete control.  Even though the Tories have done absolutely nothing with the power, they have the power.  You understand what I mean by that?  I don't like the fact that the government has so much power.  We need an opposition, at least semi-competent.  This lot are nowhere near competent, in my opinion.  The report has been put together by Labour Together, which has set up a unite MPs and activists from different traditions and was prepared by a 15-strong panel of commissioners.  So this is set up by Labour themselves and it still shows them as unable to win the next election.  And we all know Labour lie in their own benefit.  So even lying in their own benefit, they had to concede that they're doing shit.  Oh, I'm sorry, but that's hilarious to me.  Including former leader Ed Miliband, James Medway, who advised the former shadow chancellor, John McDonnell.  Wow.  This uses interviews with senior party figures as well as a previously unseen polling and analysis and outlines huge faults in Labour and in particular its election campaign.  Oh, it's not looking good for the Labour.  Maybe we should just get rid of Labour altogether and start a new opposition party.  Don't call it Labour or anything like that because we all know Labour is actually a commie party now or Marxist commies.  It's the same thing.  I don't care what you say.  And it results in millions of dead.  Prove me wrong.  Labour together says Labour has a mountain to climb to get back into power in the next five years.  A mountain?  A mountain?  Not a chance they've ever got of getting in.  Even if Boris killed half the country, I don't think they'd still get in.  This report lays out in stark detail the scale of the task.  Unless as a party and a movement we face up to that we will not win, Labour faces a substantial challenge to win the next election with a historic swing of over 10% needed to gain a majority of one seat.  No major party has ever increased their number of MPs by over 60%, which is what labour would need to do to win twenty twenty four.  so there's your legacy mr corbyn.  that's your actual legacy.  you put the final nail in the coffin.  well not maybe not the second to last nail in the coffin.  i think kirstarmer's going to do a very good job of nailing.  the last one in Labour.  activist Owen Jones was upset by the report and admitted it makes for deeply uncomfortable reading.  He tweeted, The report into Labour's catastrophic defeat is a must read.  Why?  I bet you read it before you go to bed and cry yourself to sleep.  It's deeply uncomfortable reading.  From long-term trends hitting Labour to the party's terrible strategic failures.  Strategic?  I think Labour really need to go and have a look at the Oxford Dictionary at words because it seems like they've forgotten what any word means.  The report lashes out at the toxic culture which engulfed Labour.  Oh, here we go.  This is momentum.  You know, Owen Jones is mopper.  Yep, that's the one.  Owen Jones' mob, particularly around its handling of anti-Semitism allegations and Brexit policy under Mr Corbyn's leadership.  Labour Together says our party has spent substantial periods of the last five years in conflict with itself, resulting in significant strategic and operational dysfunction.  No, it's not strategic and operational, it's just dysfunction.  Resulting in a toxic culture and limiting our ability to work effectively.  No, what you mean is you're all a bunch of racists.  That's what you mean.  This anti-Semitism is just a nice way of saying racists, is it not?  Of course it is.  These people are running around calling every one of us racists for no reason, and then they get away with just saying that they're anti-Semitic.  Not racists, racists.  They are racist.  You are a bunch of racists.  90% of the people that now still vote for Labour are racist, in my opinion.  Whether you like to admit it or not, it's been proven, in my opinion.  I like saying that in my opinion a lot.  Responsibility for this rests not wholly with one side or part of our movement.  Yes, it does.  Across our movement, we should accept our part in these divisions.  All of the people that weren't like that, Momentum and Labour together, all of the people that weren't racists in Labour, left, didn't we?  We all went and voted for other parties, i.e.  Brexit and Tories.  I wonder why that is.  I wonder why that is.  I wonder why they got the majority that they did, Labour.  Think about what you actually talk about before you actually talk about it for once.  Instead of just blurting out rubbish words one after another.  Ha ha!  Across our movement, we should accept our part in these divisions and the impact this has had on our ability to work together and present a united front to the public.  The only thing you're united in is hatred for the UK.  The review also launches a scathing attack on Mr Corbyn, stating concerns about Labour's leadership were a significant factor in our election loss in 2019 and that a Stop Jeremy Corbyn campaign was a major reason for the party's crushing election loss.  Can I just say something Labour?  I've never heard of a stop.  let Jeremy Corbyn campaign.  You know why I voted against him?  Because he's a cock.  You know why I voted against Labour?  Because you're scum.  That's why.  Labour is accused of disconnecting with voters throughout the country through the loss of institutional roots.  Warning, this stretched back over 20 years.  The review warns we will not win or deserve to win the next general election in 2024 unless all of the fundamental flaws dominating the party are quickly addressed.  Good luck with that.  Labour Together says, unless we recognise, the only thing Labour are good at is trying to hide things.  They don't fix anything, they just sweep it under the carpet and move on to the next scandal.  You don't believe me?  Look how many MPs have been charged for crimes.  Just have a look.  Labour Together says, unless we recognise and accept this triple challenge of the scale of our task, the failures of 2019 and the deep roots of how we got here will not win or deserve to win.  None can be ignored.  Our report lays bare that our defeat had deep roots.  It has deep roots.  It's just because your whole party's rife with racism and hatred.  All you ever hear out of them is anger.  It's just.  they seem to be perpetually angry at every single thing, don't they?  I'd hate to actually be in that mindset, to be honest.  I'm an optimist.  I don't want to go through life hating things.  I just want to go through life without being bothered by people.  It's not much to ask really, is it?  This loss is the story of more than one election.  Indeed, it is the story that stretches back two decades.  It's actually a bit more than that.  I actually think it's from the 60s and 70s when you messed up so badly then.  I think that was the start of your downfall because that was when the North started seeing you for the snakes you are.  Sorry, but that's my opinion.  The institutional and cultural bonds that link many voters to Labour have become weaker and weaker over time.  yes because they've not been championing us right.  they've had the councils up in the north and done nothing for the people up in the north with those councils.  so i'm not surprised.  to be honest from the loss of local labour clubs to declining trade union membership labour has lost many of the institutional roots it had within communities resulting in disconnection.  Labour lost millions of voters before it lost office in 2010, partly as a result of political alienation from politics more generally, and from the Labour Party particularly, including perceptions that there was little difference between the parties and the prominence of new cultural divides.  Well, there's little difference between the two parties.  now, to be honest.  They both seem to be different cheeks of the same arsehole, don't they?  Over many years, previous Labour voters had traditionally Labour communities have moved away, either to abstention or to smaller parties such as UKIP.  Some of those voters also chose the Conservatives for the first time in 2019, enough to help tip a number of seats over the edge where the long-term decline in Labour's vote share had been evident for years.  Right, what's my opinion on this?  Now, Labour have been in decline for quite a while.  Before UKIP, there was a lot every single year choosing to abstain from voting, so not vote at all.  Now, it wasn't that we were voting for somebody else, it was just we didn't see Labour as actually helping the communities they were supposed to represent.  And over a period of time, it never came.  Over and over and over, promises and promises and promises, and nothing actually happened.  So people were really getting switched off with politics.  And to be honest, if it had carried on that way, I don't know what would have happened for Labour, because they would never have got a vote.  And maybe that was why they swapped over from working class, who were abstaining, and swapped over to Now, I have no issue with them championing BAME.  I have no issue with that whatsoever.  What I do have an issue with is choosing one group over another.  That is seriously abhorrent.  And identity politics, like I said earlier, will kill Labour.  And if we continue to listen to the people championing it, it will kill Labour.  the UK as well, and all of the rest of the Western world.  Have you noticed how none of these identity politics people are going to the places where it could really help?  You noticed how they're only attacking Western free societies with a rule of law?  Because I actually think there's more to this, a lot more to it, but that's for another video.  But I want to know what your opinion is.  Is this them just admitting it?  Are they finally getting it through into the thicket?  I mean, they're obviously still thinking the policies are all right because they still go ahead with the same rubbish.  I do think they're going to try and blame the working class if they fail again.  They'll just immediately go, well, it's working class.  Or they'll blame the same as what America does.  Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia and bots.  You know, like the British people are not clever enough to know propaganda when we see it, considering 90% of us now dislike our media for that exact reason.  But anyway, everyone, thanks to everyone that tuned in.  Don't forget to leave me a comment.  Like, comment, share.  Stay safe, everyone, and I'll see you on the next one. ",
