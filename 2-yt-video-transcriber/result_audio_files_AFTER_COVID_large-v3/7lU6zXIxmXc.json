            "text": "what is that beautiful family?  I hope that you guys are having a great Sunday.  I am in the Winn-Dixie parking lot.  I have got to go in here and get some groceries but I wanted to come on here and bring you guys an article that is just profound to me.  you guys know that we have been watching.  you know just all the signs for the Lord's return but we've also been paying attention to the rabbis in Israel.  they have been prophesying here and there and saying a lot of things uh about their messiah um being revealed this year.  there is a rabbi and i'm actually going to bring you the article in just a second.  we're going to read over it.  but this rabbi seems very sure that this is the last um feast of trumpets that they will have without their Messiah.  He is basically saying that the Messiah is coming this year.  Now, we know that their Messiah that they are looking for is, in fact, the Antichrist.  They are not looking for Jesus.  They are looking for their own Messiah.  They don't believe that Jesus is the Messiah.  So they're looking for a different God.  but we watch these things because we know that the restrainer which is the body of christ the church um has to be removed before the antichrist is revealed.  now this um rabbi Seems to be very sure like he just knows and he has explained in this article that he very well understands that he is accountable for the things that he says.  Let's go ahead and just read it really quick and then we'll talk about it.  There have been 5,780 holidays of Rosh Hashanah since the creation of the world, but if a prominent rabbi's prediction proves true in just a few short weeks, Rosh Hashanah number 5,781 will be quite special.  Rabbi Shalom Arush said, Israel Breslov rabbi and founder of the chute shell chest institutions made an entirely uncharacteristic announcement on September 18th Jews will be celebrating the last new year without the Messiah.  I am going to tell you with certainty that Hashem God, literally the name, will help us meet together after Rosh Hashanah, Rabbi Arush said in an interview last week.  And remember well what I am telling you, that this Rosh Hashanah will be the last one without Mashiach, Messiah.  And it could very well be that on this Rosh Hashanah, the Messiah will be revealed.  The rabbi emphasized that he has never made such a statement before.  Anyone who knows me knows that for over 40 years I am teaching and have I never spoken about Messiah, Rabbi Arush said.  But these are things that are clear and everyone sees them.  I can't explain, but please don't miss out on this because this year you will receive gifts like never before.  Rabbi Arush insisted that this year would be unprecedented.  I know that in heaven they are going to ask me about every word I am saying now, Rabbi Arush said.  I cannot just say things without meaning them.  This year people are going to get great gifts.  I am telling everyone, don't miss out on this.  Make the effort.  There is nothing to be afraid of.  Our sages have told us that emissaries sent to do a mitzvah are never harmed.  Not on the way, not when they are performing the mitzvah, and not on their way home.  And this is even for a small mitzvah.  The rabbi again praised those who traveled to Uman for Rosh Hashanah.  So he says on September 18th is going to be the last new year that the Jews celebrate without their Messiah.  And that's a very, very bold statement.  I just find this to be very compelling due to the fact that we know that we're in the season.  uh of the lord's return the rapture of the church.  we're going home very soon.  um it just kind of just aligns with everything.  uh just the the fig tree parable that we always talk about how the lord says that um that generation won't pass away.  we know that we are that generation that the lord talks about in the bible seeing Israel become a nation, and all of these things will not pass away until all those things are fulfilled, the rapture of the church, the tribulation, the second coming.  And so it lines up with that.  It, you know, I know that everybody has been kind of following along with the dreams and the visions that Dana Coverstone has been getting, where he's talking about these next few months, like, oh my gosh, oh y'all there's a spider that crawled on my camera.  oh we're gonna keep rolling.  okay because it didn't go over the actual camera part.  oh guys i can i cannot all right let me refocus.  um okay so we've been fun.  we've been following along with the with all the visions and the dreams that dana has been uh receiving uh from the lord in regards to these next few months.  um the lord has been showing me a lot of things as well as a lot of other brothers and sisters.  oh i feel like i'm trying to rush now.  um it uh it's it's just it's uh profound to me that this rabbi is basically saying that the their messiah is coming this year.  so if they are You know, if they're right, it literally just adds up, guys.  It literally falls in the timeline.  It falls into like the season of the Lord's return.  Like we believe that we are in the season.  You know, I also want to say something else.  Somebody commented to me a few weeks ago, um, talking about how she was like, I really applaud you for your boldness as a watchman or watch woman, uh, for Jesus and the community.  She said, you know, a lot of other watch, you know, watch men and watch women are not, um, being bold as far as, you know, talking about like when they truly do believe that the Lord is coming.  You know, I think that Chad from Watchmen on the Wall 88, Tim, Barry, now there are a few of my brothers and sisters that I have seen that are watching for the Lord's return that have been very bold with their opinions.  Now, we don't set dates, and I see all the time people keep saying, oh, well, why are you doing this and why are you doing that if you said the Lord is returning at this time and so and so.  Um, you know, I, I feel like some people like hear us, but like, don't really listen.  Um, or they listen, but they're not really hearing us.  You know, we don't set a date.  we're watching and the Lord says that you'll know the times and the seasons.  for the time and the seasons I don't even need to write you you will know perfectly and everything is lining up.  so at the end of the day we don't know the exact day in the time.  okay but the Lord says that we would know the season and it is pretty clear that we're in the season.  So I just like encourage you guys to just like be bold in these like last moments because I think everybody's like just scared to say certain things.  I truly believe.  Now, let me just say this.  The Lord has not told me.  he didn't boom down with a voice and say chelsea i am coming so and so year.  okay but the lord does speak to us.  um and he's showing signs in the heavens and in the earth and everywhere like he's making it very clear that this is the season.  and so while we don't set dates because jesus doesn't say you know son or daughter i'm coming on this day.  you know he he doesn't do that but he gives us enough to know that we are living in the times so we occupy.  we keep living.  we don't stop living we don't sit on our hands and do nothing.  you know we keep occupying the time.  but jesus is making it so very clear and he's literally like screaming it out that we're in the season like.  This is the timing for the rapture of the church.  I believe this is what I believe, and I'm going to be bold and say it.  This is what I believe.  I believe that the Lord is coming for his church by or before 2021.  It is what I believe.  It's what I feel in my spirit.  I always go back to the dream that the Lord gave me as a 10 year old little girl.  I saw the rapture of the church.  The most crazy thing is I didn't even know what the rapture was.  My mom never told me about anything like that.  That's not really something that we talked about.  So not even knowing what the rapture of the church was and then seeing it happen, the Lord giving me the dream of the event really happening, showing me that we're at the halfway midway point.  Okay.  We got up into the atmosphere.  I know I talk about it all the time, but I've had a lot of new subscribers roll in.  Okay.  We were standing in an open field, a bunch of us, just a ton of us all spread out in this beautiful open field.  I saw the tree line ahead of me and all of a sudden we started to spiral up into the air.  And I'm explaining it like this to my mom when I woke up because I didn't say, oh, mom, we're being raptured.  I didn't know what it was.  So I'm just saying, mom, you know, we started to spiral up into the air like this and we spiraled.  We got.  we got up into the atmosphere.  We got like to the halfway midway point.  We all stopped in midair.  And all of a sudden we started to spiral back down, spiral back down like this.  And our my feet planted the ground very gentle.  He let us down very easily.  And we all turned back to wherever we were coming from.  And we just all started walking back.  And there was somebody that was walking back with me to the right of me.  And I looked to that person.  And this was actually, it wasn't me.  This was the Lord speaking it through me, telling me.  I looked to that person and said, that is a sign from God that it's almost time to go home.  I knew two things.  We were in the atmosphere, okay?  We weren't on the earth anymore.  We weren't quite to heaven.  halfway, midway point.  I knew it.  I knew it.  I knew it.  I knew it.  And then I told that person, that is a sign from God that it's almost time to go home.  And he was speaking that to me.  That was him speaking.  Because I didn't even know what the rapture was.  So... I had the dream at 10.  We spiraled up into the air.  That halfway, midway point, I believe wholeheartedly, and I'm going to be bold and say it, I believe, was when I turned 20.  And then the rapture of the church, the timing is now.  When I turned 30, I am 30.  I turned 30 February 19th.  And I believe 20 years ago, he was showing me a timeline for such a time as now.  And so we sound the alarm.  We be bold.  Okay.  Our King is coming.  Be excited.  Like, who?  what generation other than this generation us can say that we're the generation like we're gonna see the lord return like we're gonna get to meet him in the clouds like this is the most awesome amazing thing.  and so don't let the enemy like steal your joy.  and i i wanted to bring this article to you because it's just.  it's something It's just crazy.  Like they literally, he's saying that their Messiah is going to be here this year, which means, okay, say that is true.  We would have to be gone before the Antichrist is revealed.  So what does that tell you?  It literally just lines up.  to everything that's going on.  The words of knowledge that people are getting, the dreams and the visions from the Lord that I have been getting and many other people.  He said he would pour his spirit out on all flesh, on all of his children.  He would prophesy dreams, everything.  The Lord would be showing signs in the heavens and on the earth and earthquakes in diverse places.  2020 is insane.  guys like even non-believers can see that something's up like they're like.  is this the end of the world?  no you tell them the lord's coming.  jesus is coming like.  tell them how to be saved.  believe on the name of jesus and you will be saved for it is with the heart that man believes and is justified.  it is by faith alone in christ alone.  um so i am just so excited.  everything is coming together guys and um i just like i'm just so pumped i'm so excited and i just feel like you know feel like this is just a season now.  like be bold like share share jesus share your faith share your testimony.  um he's coming guys like he's really coming and he said we would know the times we'd know the season and we're there.  so don't let the enemy discourage you.  um you know resist resist him and he will flee.  um he knows his time is short.  so you guys just keep putting on the armor the armor of god.  you keep standing strong you lean on jesus for your strength.  okay and you just keep proclaiming like the name of jesus like he's coming.  so i love you out.  yeah i love you all.  I'm trying to get out of this car because I don't know where the spider went.  I've got to go and get groceries.  I'll talk to you soon.  Love you all. ",
