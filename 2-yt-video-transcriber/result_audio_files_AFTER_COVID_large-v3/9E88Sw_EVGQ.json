            "text": "What's going on, everybody?  I just want to make a quick video here where a good friend of mine just sent me this.  This is pretty huge, I would think.  This is the records that were related to Comey dismissing the Clinton case.  And if you come down to page 21 here, in these records, in his own notes, it says child crime folders forever.  Five freaking five folders on child crime.  So who knows what's in this?  But man, these need to be made freaking public.  You're telling me that an elected official has five child crime folders that you were looking through?  And you didn't find the need to investigate this any further?  This is freaking crazy, man.  All right, this was dismissed.  This is from May of 2017.  So this is just their guys running cover for them, as always.  Just like when you look at the Whitewater case, all right?  Here's a special committee to investigate Whitewater Development Corporation-related matters back in 1996.  Oh, and look who was one of the deputy special counsels, James B. Comey.  How fortunate that they always have this guy as one of the ones looking into them.  And this is reminiscent of the June 2018 Department of Justice OIG report.  where if you go down to page 293 in Coleman's notes, it has Anthony Weiner, right?  And then it says it was texting a 15-year-old sexually explicit, right?  So that's Weiner's crime against children.  And if it comes down here, the last two lines are Hillary Clinton and Foundation crime against children.  So I imagine this is coming from the same thing.  And of course, Comey's playing dumb.  Oh, I don't recall the briefing by Coleman.  Well, funny that it's right in your own freaking notes.  Which then, this comes out, just the other day, again in line with all this, that Ghislaine Maxwell's nephew had actually worked under Hillary Clinton at the State Department.  What a freaking coincidence.  That he had served as a staff assistant from May 2009 to June 2012.  Which, thanks to this resurfaced report from NBC News back in 2013, if you remember, Hillary Clinton was already caught covering up pedophilia charges while in the State Department. ",

Allegations of prostitution and pedophilia and allegations that those crimes were somehow covered up or not looked into.  So the State Department this morning is having to respond to those claims and those investigations of misconduct by State Department officials including by an ambassador and security agents attached to then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.  And the allegations are that these investigations were whitewashed, quashed altogether, and that those orders came from high up. ",

A State Department memo says the ambassador, quote, routinely ditched his protective security detail in order to solicit sexual favors from both prostitutes and minor children.  The memo also says a top State Department official directed department investigators to, quote, cease the investigation into the ambassador's conduct.  It's just one of what another document describes as, quote, several examples of undue influence from top state officials. ",

We know that he was deputy counsel in the Whitewater case, so you make what you want of that.  And she had Ghislaine Maxwell's nephew working for her from 2009 to 2012.  This is not to mention when their friend Laura Silsby got arrested trying to take 33 Haitian children out of Haiti during the chaos of the aftermath of the earthquake, and that it was Bill Clinton who actually went down to Haiti that asked them to release her, or that after that, Laura Silsby, or Gaylor now, got a job at AlertSense, which is the company that makes the tech for Amber Alerts.  So that's good.  And all this should come as no surprise, being that... Jeffrey Epstein helped furnish Bill Clinton's White House Oval Office, okay?  Here's a thank you letter for him.  We thank you for this contribution, which will be used solely for the benefit of the White House, primarily to assist in the funding of cost refurbishing of the Oval Office in the West Wing and certain areas of the executive residence.  Wow.  Thanks, Jeffrey Epstein.  So again, just one more piece to the disturbing puzzle that is the Clintons. ",
