            "text": "1 Corinthians 2.14 says, The man without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned.  Many Calvinists take this verse to mean that lost people cannot understand the Gospel and willingly accept it as true unless God regenerates them first.  Some refer to this doctrine as pre-faith regeneration, which means you must be born again in order to believe the gospel.  The Apostle John wrote, The gospels are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name.  But Calvinistic doctrine says one must be given new life in order to believe.  So, according to Calvinism, people who reject the gospel are doing so because God is withholding from them the necessary grace of regeneration, which they need to accept his words as true.  One prominent Calvinistic pastor, Dr.  John MacArthur, explains it this way. ",

            "text": "This is the Calvinistic doctrine sometimes referred to as total depravity or total inability, the T of the famous tulip acrostic.  But does 1 Corinthians chapters 1 and 2 support this Calvinistic doctrine?  Let's take a closer look.  It is next to impossible to fully understand Paul's intention in 1 Corinthians 1.18-2.16 without first having some understanding of the concept of wisdom in the Greek culture.  Paul uses the form of the word wisdom 26 times in just the first three chapters.  Needless to say, the Apostle's theme is overwhelming.  The mistake of many Calvinists is to presume that this passage is a contrast between the abilities of the regenerate and the unregenerate, or the natural man versus the spiritual man, or the elect versus the reprobate.  In actuality, Paul is drawing a contrast between those who trust in human wisdom versus divine revelation.  Obviously, Paul felt the inspired scriptures were sufficient to grant mankind the understanding for salvation.  We know this because of what he wrote to Timothy.  Quote, From childhood you have known the sacred writings, which are able to give you the wisdom that leads to salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.  All scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness.  2 Timothy 3.15-16.  The Calvinist begins on the wrong footing when he reads the phrase, the word of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, and takes that to mean that mankind is born morally incapable of thinking the gospel is anything except foolish.  God did not decree for man's nature to be such that he was born only able to deem his own word to be foolish.  Those depending on human wisdom instead of divine revelation will deem the cross foolish.  But it's mankind's individual responsibility to decide on which to place their trust.  Besides Calvinists beginning on an unfounded assumption, their interpretation ultimately places the culpability back onto their maker.  Consider objectively the claims of Calvinism.  God decreed for fallen man to be born morally incapable of assessing his own word as anything other than foolish, and then are made to perish as a result.  This is not the intention of Paul in this or any passage.  Paul's intention is to say that those who rely on human wisdom instead of the spiritual truths brought by the inspired apostles will see the cross as foolish and perish as a result.  The apostles overarching concern in this passage is to make the case for true wisdom as held in contrast with the wisdom of the wise in verse 19, the wisdom of this world in verse 20 and in 319, or the carnal wisdom of men in chapter 2 verse 5.  The Greeks boasted in their wisdom, and Paul is providing them a spiritually inspired warning by teaching them what true wisdom looks like.  That wisdom is contained in the gospel revelation.  There is nothing about that revelation that is insufficient in enabling a willing response.  Those who ignore the apostle's warning are not to be thought of as victims of God's unchangeable decree, as we must conclude if the claims of Calvinism are true.  After all, if Calvinism is true, then unbelief is inevitable due to factors beyond the unbeliever's control.  There is literally nothing they can do about it, because it is just the way they were born, by divine decree, no less.  No, anyone who chooses to trade the clearly revealed truth in for lies stands as a fool without excuse, as seen in Romans 1.20 and Psalm 14.1.  Once a clear distinction is drawn between the wisdom of the world and heaven's wisdom, Paul moves on to speak of, quote, the deep things of God in chapter 2, verse 10.  Just as you cannot know what is in my mind.  unless I reveal it, so too no one can access, quote, the deep things of God unless these mysteries are made known by his spirit.  Clearly, there are some deep mysteries kept hidden in the mind of God for a time.  as the Apostle Paul noted in verses 8 and 9.  We speak of God's secret wisdom, a wisdom that has been hidden and that God destined for our glory before time began.  None of the rulers of this age understood it, for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.  You see, it is only now that the mystery of Christ is being fully made known to all people.  By what means?  Some inner spiritual enlightenment?  An irresistible regenerative working?  What does the scripture tell us?  is the means God employed to help the world understand the depth of God's spiritual mysteries?  Paul expounds in Ephesians 3, 1-11. ",

            "text": "For this reason, I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles, surely you have heard about the administration of God's grace that was given to me for you, that is, the mystery made known to me by revelation, as I have already written briefly?  In reading this, then, you will be able to understand my insight into the mystery of Christ, which was not made known to people in other generations, as it has now been revealed by the Spirit of God's holy apostles and prophets.  This mystery is that through the gospel, the Gentiles are heirs together with Israel, members together of one body, and sharers together in the promise in Christ Jesus.  I became a servant of this gospel by the gift of God's grace given me through the working of His power.  Although I am less than the least of all the Lord's people, this grace was given me by the Spirit of God's holy apostles and prophets.

I became a servant of this gospel by the gift of God's grace given me through the working of His power.  although I am less than the least of all the Lord's people, this grace was given me to preach to the Gentiles the boundless riches of Christ, and to make plain to everyone the administration of this mystery, which for ages past was kept hidden in God, who created all things.  His intent was that now, through the church, the manifold wisdom of God should be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realms, according to His eternal purpose that He accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord.

            "text": "Clearly, the means by which God assists mankind to understand the deep mysteries of spiritual truth is by inspiration of chosen messengers.  As Paul writes in 1 Corinthians 2.13, \"...we also speak not in words taught by human wisdom, but in those taught by the Spirit, combining spiritual thoughts with spiritual  words.\".  The Holy Spirit revealed mysteries to His holy apostles and prophets, and in turn, they write down insight into the mystery of Christ, and preach to the nations, so that the wisdom of God might now be made known.  There is absolutely nothing in all of Scripture that even remotely suggests that humanity is unable to willingly respond to this gracious, Holy Spirit-wrought truth of divine revelation.  Now with this in mind, let's focus on the key passage of this debate, 1 Corinthians 2.14, which reads as follows, The man without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned.  Simply put, this could be taken in one of two ways.  First, the Calvinistic meaning would ultimately have to be that fallen humanity, if not irresistibly regenerated by the Spirit, cannot want to accept the things that come from the Spirit of God, for God has unchangeably decreed that revealed truth, the apostles' teaching in Scripture, will only be seen as foolishness to them.  The provisionist meaning, on the other hand, would be that men who rest on worldly wisdom by freely choosing not to accept the things that come from the Spirit of God, the Apostles' teaching and Scripture, but freely deem them as foolish, cannot understand spiritual truth.  Why?  Because those are the means of spiritual revelation.  The understanding of 1 Corinthians 2.14 becomes very simple when we answer the first question posed by this verse.  Why won't the natural man accept the things that come from the Spirit of God?  One possible answer is, well, because God determined it, by divine decree, as a punishment for the sin of Adam, which ultimately takes the responsibility off the unbeliever and puts it back onto God.  The other possible answer as to why people refuse to accept the Spirit's teaching is because they freely chose the wisdom of the world over the wisdom being revealed by spiritually wrought means such as the Apostles' teachings and the Scripture.  This puts the blame back squarely upon the unbeliever, not on God's eternal decree, or is withholding some measure of grace necessary for them to believe.  See, we believe Paul is saying that the natural man is one who will not accept the wisdom from the Spirit of God, because he himself considers these things to be foolish by his own free choice, not God's determination.  therefore the unbeliever is incapable of ever understanding spiritual things unless and until he turns from human wisdom and accepts the wisdom being revealed by the spirit through his chosen means the apostles the scriptures.  how can any man really understand something he has already deemed foolish in his heart?  He cannot.  Those who rely upon the wisdom of this age, over and above the clear revelation of the Spirit, cannot begin to understand the deep truths of God.  This message seems to be the clear intention of the apostle.  And the following verses support this line of reasoning, as Paul goes on to confront the carnal brethren in Corinth, as likewise being unable to receive these same, quote, deep things of God, due to their carnality.  as seen in chapter 3, verses 1 through 3.  The clear implication is that these believers' choices to live carnally, just like the unbelievers' choices to deem God's word as foolish, is the root cause of their inability to accept and understand spiritual truth, the apostles' teaching.  The believers' carnality, like the unbelievers' rejection of God's word, is a result of their own choosing, not of God's determination.  It is the responsibility of the believer to turn from carnality so as to receive the spiritual meat of God's Word, just as it is the unbeliever's responsibility to turn from fleshly wisdom when confronted by the Holy Spirit-wrought truth of the Gospel.  So to recap, if you trust in worldly wisdom, you will deem the cross as foolish.  But if you listen to divine revelation brought by the Holy Spirit through his apostles, you will be able to understand the deep things of God.
