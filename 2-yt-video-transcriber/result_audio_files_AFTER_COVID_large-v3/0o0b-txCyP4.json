            "text": "Everybody is John the Other, obviously.  And this story hinges on me seeing something in the window of a building that is near where I live.  And I have debated whether or not to talk about it because it might seem to some people that I'm trying to get people to go harass this person.  I'm going to say no, that's not, I can defend that.  that's not a legitimate complaint because I'm not trying to get anybody to harass this person.  And if you went and saw what I'm going to describe, if you did anything about it, that would be just on you, on you, not on me.  So I'm going to start by saying, and I don't think I actually need to say this, but if you know where this is that I'm about to describe, For God's sake, leave the guy alone, right?  Don't go fuck with the person, seriously.  Now, on my way to work the other day, I'm walking up the street to get on transit.  And I see that somebody has printed out on 8.5 by 11 sheets of paper, one word per page.  A message that they have taped to the glass window on the outside of their balcony.  You know, on their sliding glass doors out to their balcony facing the street.  And it says, What have you done today to fight racism?  You know, like, challenge to everybody who walks past.  Are you doing your part?  Shame on you if you're not.  And I walked past it.  I saw this.  I was like... Oh, the cringe, the cringe.  And I had a series of thoughts that flowed from seeing this.  The first was not very thoughtful.  It was like, fuck you.  Like, no, you know what I've done?  Nothing.  You know why?  Because I'm not a racist and most people aren't either.  That was my thought.  I didn't shout this or anything, but it was in my head.  And then I kind of began to think about it a little more.  And I realized, what is this, or maybe not realized, but started to wonder, like, what is the actual intention of that message?  Is the person who, like, and they printed out pieces of paper, what are you doing today to fight racism?  You know, what are you doing today to fight racism?  Like, okay, less than 10 pieces of paper, but... What's your intention?  Are you actually trying to fight racism?  Or are you trying to go, look at me!  I'm not a racist!  Look at me!  Hey everybody, look at me!  I'm virtuous!  Is that what they're doing?  Or, number one, they actually think they're fighting racism.  Number two, they're being a ridiculous, clownishly pathetic, empty virtue signaler.  Or maybe this is a person who is actually genuinely demented.  Like they are whatever they work in a college university environment or they work somewhere that has a real big social justice cult that's got its talons into their soft little squidgy brain.  And they've been broken down as a person so that they're now bleeding out these social justice virtue signals.  Is this a person in distress?  And they think that this is the virtuous, proper thing to do, but what you see is a person who's actually been demoralized and broken down by being continuously attacked.  Is this some guilt-ridden white liberal who has been pounded on by social justice and feminists for, you know, however many years, until their brain turned to mush, and like, you know, what you're seeing is a person in deep distress, I don't know, I mean, like, I didn't go talk to them, and I thought, well, maybe I should, maybe I should figure out what apartment that is, and go talk to them, and then I realized, no, they're probably, they probably, anybody who isn't, like, slavishly in agreement with them, is clearly a Nazi, and needs to be punched in the face, and I really, I don't have enough time in my day to be getting in fistfights, like, Come on, I'm a grown-ass adult.  I don't need it.  And the likelihood that any such conversation would result in them trying to throw a punch at me, I judge to be quite high.  So yeah, I don't need it.  Not interested.  Even though it would be coming from a person who is quite likely in very deep and serious long-term mental pain because they have been bullied and tormented and psychologically broken down to the point where they're now printing off this absurd message and putting it in their window to try to challenge the world to, you know, like, virtue up or maybe come and get punched in the mouth.  Anyway, so I was thinking about this basically most of the night while I was at work trying to figure out, like, what the hell's going on here?  Like... This isn't just some isolated one lone nutter.  This is now a social disease that seems to be spreading.  And I went back to that Smithsonian Institute little infographic of what all the things are that are whiteness and when you read through it, it's all positive.  It's all like self-reliance and empiricism and being future-focused and deferring gratification and all this other good stuff.  Things that are necessary for you to be a successful person in your life regardless of what color you are.  But a saying on the infographic that these things are solely and singularly the province of white people or whiteness which is very demeaning and racist towards anybody who's not white, and also seemingly very dangerously a template to have a white racist supremacist movement emerge with this as their basic thought process.  So I went and did a little more reading, and my initial thought of that whiteness infographic, the one that we have all seen so much about, I thought, well, this is some confused, ding-dong, black activists who hate white people, and this is their stupid, half-baked attack that they haven't really thought through.  But then I found out that it was actually, this document was created by a woman who is a has a PhD in some kind of grievance studies named Judith Katz, Dr.  Judith Katz.  Now, I don't really like to call her doctor because she doesn't have a degree in a legitimate academic discipline.  It's a studies.  It's a grievance field.  So there's no real academic rigor.  But this is a social justice academic feminist, basically, who has crafted this little Extremely inflammatory, unbelievably anti-black racist document pretending to be anti-white racism, pretending to be... I mean, it's confusing.  So, I'm still wondering what the hell is going on, and here is one of my theories, and I would like to know if you guys think I'm on the right track here.  Academic feminists, which is to say feminists driving most of the rest of the social justice movements, are trying to create or facilitate a rise in racist white supremacist movements so that they will have an actual serious enemy to contend with.  Because they don't actually have an actual serious enemy to contend with.  Well, they do.  It's normal people.  They certainly hate and despise and loathe normal, healthy, well-adjusted people.  But they don't have an evil.  They don't have like anything that's actually properly evil or malevolent to contend with.  What they're contending with is, you know, decent human beings, which in the scale of good versus bad makes the feminists evil.  So what they want is something that is objectively evil and powerful and dangerous and frightening, So that when they fight them, then the feminists can look like they're the good guys.  And so to do that, they're now trying to create and trying to cultivate the growth of white nationalists, Nazi, neo-Nazi, white supremacist movement on a large scale and make that an actual growing force in the United States and Canada and everywhere else so that the feminists can Have a real and actual evil enemy to fight.  I think that's what's happening.  Let me know what you think.  And as always, thanks for watching and have a lovely, lovely day. ",
