            "text": "Hi, folks.  I'm Steve Hindy with Showing Animals Respect and Kindness.  Three days ago, on January 3rd, 2021, I was assaulted by two thugs at a cockfight a few miles outside of Waterloo, Ohio.  These guys, they beat me up twice.  They gashed my head.  I needed six staples to close it.  They broke a rib.  and they caused a separation in my back.  They wanted to send a message, these criminals, about how they weren't going to be stopped.  And I'm here to tell them and tell all the cockfighters, we got the message, okay?  You need to know right now, we got the message.  It's not quite the message you meant to send.  I want you to know that as committed as we were to going after cockfighting, to crushing cockfighting as we were before, it's quadrupled that now.  Understand this.  This isn't the end.  It's just the beginning.  Three days ago, you cracked my ribs, broke my rib, You gashed my head, caused a separation in my back.  It's causing a lot of pain.  I'm not going to kid about that.  I'll tell you this.  I will never forget that, okay?  Here's my promise to you.  You're never going to forget it either.  So my assailants, there have been a lot of comments about the beatdown they gave me.  It says a lot about cockfighters.  They're celebrating that two guys ganged up on somebody, that James Newcomb comes to the front and he makes all the noise and everything.  Well, I call him the sneak.  He comes around behind so he can blindside somebody.  And then when somebody's down, then he's kicking him in the head, kicking him in the ribs.  Real men there representing other real men, eh?  And then, of course, you run my associate off the road.  Let me tell you something.  Shark associates may not be my blood, but they are my family.  So now you've brought my family into it.  You know what that means, newcomers and all you other cockfighters?  Now you just brought your families into it.  Think about that.  Oh, and about that drone that you stole and destroyed because you're so afraid of what it's going to film about you and your criminal activities.  Let me ask you, did it look like this drone?  Did you stupid asses think that that was the only one?  Well, in that case, Let me introduce you to some of my little friends.  Yeah, these drones, they can see you when you can't see them at all.  And I'm going to prove that to you.  So you might be asking yourself, does this mean that I'm back? ",
