Why would you walk up to the camera and they tell you?  I got a camera.  Tell them because I got a camera.  Say that when you walk way up there.  You ain't see it right here.  You cover your face then you talk crap when you walk away. ",

So what's the problem?  Why you can do it and I can't do it?  I didn't say you can't do it.  Yeah, but you obviously got a problem with it.  I didn't walk up to your camera.  Who are you?  I'm someone that's filming.  That's who I am.  You should turn it the other way.  You get a better portrait view.  You look good.  Sorry, you get a landscape view.  That's a portrait view.  That's called vertical recording syndrome.  You should learn how to operate a camera.  You look good.  I know.  I know.  I know.  That's what your girl said.  Down here, you might as well.  What you recording?  Camera right below.  It is real.  It's not a shot.  Here it is.  What are you talking?  Eric.  And you are?  Khakis.  Khaki pants.  You are?  Peace out.  Be safe.

I was really coming to take pictures of the yachts, the boats.  nosy lady you're nosy.  mind your business.  mind your business and you won't look so bad on the internet.  you're gonna look really bad on the internet.  you're gonna look really bad on the internet.  mind your business.  yeah walk away.  you're gonna look really bad on the internet.  you're gonna be the thumbnail.  i have an issue with this company.  Yeah, I have his whole property.  employees like to come out to the public and harass.  You're gonna be the thumbnail.  you're gonna look really good on YouTube.  Now look for it.  It's going to be Idiots in West Palm Beach.  That's going to be the name of it.  Idiots in West Palm.  What you doing?  Is it you again?  What's the deal?  Hey, hey, talk to me.  Why are you taking pictures of kids?  You told y'all I was taking pictures of kids.  So why you confront me with that?  Did you see me taking pictures of kids?  But did you see me taking pictures of kids?  I did not.  Have I broken the law at all?  Okay.  Have I broken the law?  Have I broken the law?  No, answer my question.  Have I broken the law?  No.  Okay.  Alright.  Okay.  I don't want to talk.  I'm working right now.  I don't bother you when you're working.  So I don't want to talk.  Is there any part of me that look like I don't know how to ask for help?  I have no idea.  So why do you think I need help?  Normal people don't go around filming people, so I want to see if you need any help.  What do you mean?  You guys go around filming people all the time.  It's my policy.  You guys aren't normal?  It's my policy.  It's my policy as well.  It's also my policy.  You guys aren't the only one getting to have a policy.  What's your name and your badge number?  And once again, yours is?  Martin, what's your badge number?  What's your badge number?  Well, can you tell me again?  You're making another contact with me.  Thank you.  That wasn't so hard to do, was it?  But you guys should really go where somebody's committing a crime.  I'm not breaking the law.  They need you somewhere where people are getting mugged, they're getting robbed.  But once they tell you somebody's taking pictures, you gotta say that's not against the law and don't even come because I have to pay for this call.  Taxpayers have to pay for this stuff.  Is that illegal?  But it is illegal to take pictures of kids.  Is it illegal?  Okay.  You're a law enforcer.  You're not a psychologist.  You're not a psychologist.  You're not a psychiatrist.  You're not my employer.  So your questions, if it's not involving the law, are mute to me.  You're a law enforcer.  There's no law to enforce.  There's nothing to do here.  right now what are you doing?  you're standing around.  you're getting free money because there's no law to be enforced right here.  so you really need to get back to work when somebody is doing something wrong.  i'm working.  yes i don't answer questions.  yeah no you're not trying to have a conversation you're trying to fish.  what question did i ask you asked?  um I don't answer questions.  Yeah, I don't answer questions.  You seem like you're pretty cool, man.  So I don't really want to get into you too much, but I'm not breaking the law.  And people can't be afraid of cameras because there's cameras everywhere.  And all I'm doing is I hear showing people that I'm an American and I have rights.  And this is one of them.  And where their where their fear starts, my rights don't end.  So maybe if they just stay on their property and wait till someone actually does something to their property, but they can't preemptively call you guys and say, hey, I don't want to be recorded.  As you know, anybody can call the police.  Yeah, but you guys need to start charging them, man.  Because I'm sure they call 911.  That I don't know, but it's not for me to decide.  Can I get a call number, though?  Sorry?  Can I get a call number?  A call number for what?  A call number for the 911 call.  Did they call?  I have no idea, sir.  Well, give me the call number, but you got to respond here.  Yeah, or the call number, incident number.  Can I get that?  Yeah, I need that.  Yeah, but I really, I wish you guys would handle it over the phone.  Something like what?  You guys got training on public photography, right?  You guys didn't get any training on public photography?  I wouldn't call it public photography.  You take a picture of the crime scene, take a picture of it.  Is that what you're talking about?  No, like people out recording, like people coming to the police department.  I know you guys remember when somebody... Yeah, like it's okay to do that.  It is, right.  So it's the same thing.  So that's why you guys should be more responsible with the taxpayer's money.  But when the call comes in, we got to make sure it's straight.  That's all.  If I can call you, dude, since I don't know your name.  That's all.  I said, we're just trying to figure out what's going on, man.  See, you're real cool, but the way he came up just, you know.  But I understand, you know, you got to try to take control right away, but that shouldn't be the way it goes.  Excuse me.  Come on by.  Sorry about that.  It's all right.  You can stay out long doing this?  No, I'll probably leave once you guys leave.  Don't have a dog in the fight.  I'm a dog fan.  Yeah, we'll be all right.  I hope so.
