            "text": "Hi guys this is your sister Karen Gidden in Jesus Christ.  Brothers and sisters I'm finally ready.  I'm finally ready to release this powerful beautiful overwhelming.  I'm talking about it and I feel like I want to cry but I'm not gonna cry.  vision I don't know why I have no idea why the most high favors me.  I have no idea no idea at all but I am grateful.  I am truly, and I say this with the most humblest, there's such a word.  I say this with the most genuine and humbleness inside of me.  I am super humble.  I'm super humble, brothers and sisters.  this beautiful, it wasn't really a vision, more like a trance, to be honest with you.  But February, this is a long, you know, what we're in, we're nearly in May.  So this is how long it took me to release this vision because I was doing the corona stuff and all of that.  But in February, I forgot, I think it's the second week, either the second or the first week in February, The Most High gave me a trance, yes.  It literally gave me, or it put me in a trance, I went into a trance.  And I remember, brothers and sisters, my husband was on the bed because he was watching TV, but you know, I'm not into television and all that, I don't really watch TV, but he was watching a movie.  And I remember, Brothers and sisters, I could hear the TV, but also part of me went into a trance.  And when I went into this trance, brothers and sisters, I saw in front of me on a plaque.  It was like a board plaque, okay?  A board plaque.  And I saw written on this plaque, The birthday of the Messiah, Jesus Christ.  That is what I saw, okay?  I know some of you don't call him Jesus Christ and all of that.  I'm not gonna get into that, but you know, those of us who call him Jesus Christ, we know what we're calling on, okay?  And it's not Caesar Borgia, all right?  We know the king of the Bible, all right?  So I saw on this plaque a message that says, just came in front of me, And it says, the birthday of the Messiah is the 9th of September, 20.  It's either 20 or 21.  One of those two.  I think it's 21, but the year is either 20 or 21.  And it just stayed there in front of me just like that, brothers and sisters.  And then it just disappeared.  And I came out the trance.  I was taken back.  I was like, oh, I didn't doubt it or anything like that.  I didn't went into prior.  It wasn't something I've ever asked the Lord to say, you know, Lord, tell me your birthday.  I've never done that.  So when he revealed that to me, The day, the 9th, the month, September and the year 21 or 20.  Okay, that's what came up with the 21 or 20.  I was taken back.  So that is the birthday of the Messiah.  Hallelujah.  Hallelujah to the Lamb of God.  Oh brothers and sisters, I'm not going to keep like Christmas parties or anything like that.  This information, why he gave me this information, I have no idea.  That is the reason why I say, I don't know why the Most High favors me this much.  I am so humbled.  I am super, and sisters and I was so excited to share it with with you the body of the world of our Lord.  but because I was doing all the videos you know and I said to the Lord Father I really want to release this because I think about it every day like you know I think about his birthday like oh the Messiah just that's his birthday.  you know that's his birthday the 9th the 9th of September.  uh 20 or 21 one of the one one out of those two.  um and i think i did a little calculation and i think it's nearly 2 000 years 20 or 21. you do your calculation yourself brothers and sisters.  like i said it's 2 000 years since since he came and all of that and i think it came up near to that something like that.  oh i i'm sorry brothers and sisters i'm just really excited.  i'm just so pleased i don't know to know that.  sorry to know that he has revealed his birthday but not hey brothers and sisters oh wow wow wow.  as i'm talking to you now as i'm talking to you know something just dawned on me hallelujah hallelujah.  thank you lord for that revelation.  so The Lord told him that his birthday is on the 9th of September.  Isn't 9, yeah, 9-11, isn't it?  You know, the Twin Towers and all.  Oh, wow.  Could it be they knew?  Because Satan knows when the Lord... They know, you know, they know.  The devil knows the birthday of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.  He knows.  He knows, brothers and sisters.  So... And obviously he's stolen, there's no word for stolen.  Obviously he has stolen his minions, but obviously they're not gonna come out and reveal that truth to us.  They won't say anything.  They keep it as wicked Christmas, which is total pagan, because he wasn't born on the 25th.  That's very demonic.  He mustn't celebrate Christmas at all, okay?  get out of that peg and you will be heavily judged.  not that you will celebrate the 9th of september because we're not really called to celebrate his birthday.  all right like that.  um but wow could it be the mocking?  well nobody can mock the most high anyway even if they try.  um but could it be something like?  they knew that this is his birthday and they did it because america is babylon.  right it's it's.  it's mr babylon it's spiritual egypt spiritual rome.  so could it be a case of?  you know as i said they know that this is his birthday and they blow up the twin tower as a form of i don't know i don't know what these people are thinking but that just came to me as i'm talking to you brothers and sisters as i release this vision and this beautiful trance.  but yeah so you know well i know i know the birthday of the most high sun.  You know, it's beautiful.  It's beautiful, but I just wanted to come and share that with you.  It'll take a little time out from the Corona that's going on and just share this this good news this good news for those of you who you know will accept it and people might have their different opinions on his birthday but I only can go by my vision what he showed me.  and and I believe it I have.  no I have no doubt to doubt the Spirit of the Lord.  I have no doubt to doubt him.  And if he says his birthday, you know, the Messiah's birthday is on the 9th of September, 20 or 20 or 21, one of those two that came.  I just can't remember if it's 20 or 21.  And then that's his birthday.  That's his birthday, brothers and sisters.  So I just wanted to come to you.  I just wanted to come to you and release this magnificent, powerful, beautiful, joyous, happy vision to you concerning our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ of Nazareth.  Hallelujah.  To you, my brothers and sisters.  So God eternally bless you.  I love you all.  And I will see you soon.  Someday in glory.  In Jesus Christ's precious holy name.  Amen and amen.  Amen.  Blessings.  Amen. ",
