Most of you know that about a year ago we met a group of people who were recording the police and putting their videos up online.  We didn't really understand why they were doing it or why it was important.  We did know that what they were showing us on YouTube had nothing to do with what we had seen on television and in the movies when it came to police.  So we thought we would start doing what they were doing to try to describe what was going on in our family courts.  And in order to do that, we need to talk about the family home, which is often the subject of a divorce or custody case.  Many families find a community based on a real estate agent who introduces them to an area where they can afford.  You investigate the schools and the crime rates.  You look for good teachers, and you make sure that your streets are going to be safe for your children to play in.  Few of us ever think about what will happen if that family home should be the subject of a divorce case. ",

Do you have any comment about your attorneys discussing evidence outside the courtroom, which I heard and took notes on, related to witnesses that you wanted to preclude from testifying at the board?  Well, you shouldn't be overhearing or eavesdropping on an attorney-client conversation.  Sir, he's represented by the IDEO.  This is Terry Houghton.  He has been selling real estate and doing real estate investments for nearly as long as his wife has been a family law attorney.  It was very rare that the district attorney would prosecute somebody involved in real estate and an attorney, and so we started following this case back in 2017.  Judge Mnookian granted one of my associates permission to record these proceedings.  and so we have video of what it looked like inside the courtroom because valerie houghton was not put in jail while she awaited her trial.  in fact she was appointed in a number of cases to represent children and she had an ability to accept appointments as a private judge in family law cases meaning she wasn't sitting in jail awaiting trial.  she spent nearly five years continuing to earn income where she could be paid for the county, and where the county was also paying for her husband's criminal defense, as he claimed to be too poor to afford it.  Thank you, Your Honor.  Perhaps the only people who don't like to be recorded more than the police are lawyers, judges, and unlicensed real estate agents.  Because shortly after I posted this video, I was contacted by a number of brokers from Gilroy and Los Gatos who told me that Patty Felice never had a broker's license in the past 26 years.  which means when a private judge appointed her in my divorce case, she had no authority to sell real estate, much less enter my home, just as that judge in the video you just saw did.  And when people act outside the law, and it's not caught by the licensing agencies or the district attorney, the public is harmed.  And so we are investigating how it could be that the California Department of Real Estate failed to catch the fact that Patty Felice sold over 400 homes in California without a valid broker's license, and how it could be that she would be appointed by a family court judge and the district attorney would be more concerned about me recording the police than investigating people who were engaged in real estate fraud in Santa Clara County.

Okay, I bet you didn't make as big of a mistake as this realtor made.  Uh-huh.  And so while we've watched people lose trust in the police, in the courts, and in our prosecutors in the recent years, we also now can add real estate.  And we're going to see if the Department of Real Estate will do anything about it.  But we're also going to continue to investigate the relationship between Patty Felice... and intero real estate and divorce cases in santa clara county because there is more than an appearance that the private judges are using intero real estate to sell off properties at a rate that just doesn't add up.  I'm going to ask to see the court records that Jason Pintar is required to have as a private judge here in Santa Clara County when he hears divorce cases.  He's only an attorney.  He's never had training.  He's never been elected as a judge, but he's been given full powers to act as a judge, and his name was recently published on a private judging list.  So here we go.  Hi, I'm We're recording just to let you know.  We're doing an investigation.  OK.  It's going to be an interesting time for you to be a visitor. ",
