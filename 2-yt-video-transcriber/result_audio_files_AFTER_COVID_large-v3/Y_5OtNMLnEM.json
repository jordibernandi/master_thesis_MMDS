            "text": "Hello, Tony Vera, LAX.  There was a rumor yesterday that I thought I missed a big story at Tom Bradley.  Then Congressman Adam Schiff was arrested by the LAPD and LAXPD.  It was all over the internet yesterday on Twitter.  And I found out yesterday that that is not true.  I would have basically asked like, wow, I missed that?  But it was a very real rumor, but it turned out to be a falsehood.  That was a big shot.  If anybody got that, somebody would have got it on a cell phone, but I've asked a few cops, and it's totally not true.  So I'm here today for a few hours.  I'm going to try to get some videos if I can.  Okay, folks, I'll talk to you guys later. ",
