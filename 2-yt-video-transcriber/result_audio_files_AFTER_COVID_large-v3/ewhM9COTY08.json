            "text": "Hey, what's going on, guys?  I'm Dr.  Boyce Watkins, and I am here with Rufus T. Blackwell from the Biden campaign.  He's deeply concerned about Ice Cube's decision to go meet with both the Biden campaign and the Trump campaign.  Rufus, welcome to the show.  Well, thank you there, Dr.  Boyce.  I'm real mad at that there.  Ice T., Ice Cube, Ice Cream, whatever his name is.  That boy got some explaining to do.  So what is there to explain?  He was trying to get the best deal for black people.  He met with the Biden campaign.  They didn't respond to his contract with Black America.  Then he went to go meet with the other side to see if they would hear him out.  What's wrong with getting a good deal for black people?  Well, see, that's where you get it wrong right there, Dr.  Boss.  You act like black people matter.  You act like black people are supposed to get something for your vote.  Who told you that nonsense?  That's a bunch of malarkey there.  That's what Biden said.  Wait, wait, did you just call him Massa Biden?  Yes, sir, I did call him Master Biden.  Another name I like to use is my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.  That's what Master Biden is.  Ain't nobody loved us like Mr.  Biden.  Master Biden loves us.  We loves us some Master Biden.  You got a problem with that there, boy?  Okay, so Rufus, the Biden campaign seems to be upset as if black people don't have a right to even have a conversation with Republicans.  What does that come from?  What are you talking about, boy?  Black people ain't got no rights.  You're supposed to do what the hell we tell you to do.  That's what you're supposed to do.  Black people ain't supposed to be out here thinking and making decisions and stuff.  You are not.  Black leaders are not supposed to be black.  Did you say that black leaders aren't supposed to be black?  That we're not supposed to make our own decisions?  If the good Lord had intended for Negroes to be making decisions, he wouldn't have invented people like Joe Biden. ",
