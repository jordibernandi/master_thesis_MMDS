It seems mostly innocuous at first glance, so let's give it a watch and see what lessons Jehovah's Witnesses want their members to learn from it.  Let's get into it.  Let me give you a little lead up to this.  Basically, the premise is that this dude's wife seems to be getting obsessed with quote-unquote worldly riches.  She's got a new part-time job in real estate, selling houses, and he doesn't like it.  Generally speaking, Jehovah's Witnesses don't believe in having careers.  They believe in having jobs.  Nothing more.  If you have any amount of energy in your life, it should be focused on Jehovah's Witnesses, not a career.  Take a look. ",

He believes that he should be the provider and she should devote her entire life to door knocking.  The religion shouldn't be a hobby, it should be a way of life.  While this is going on, the husband has been studying the Bible with this guy, Joe, trying to get him baptized.  Baptism is a very long process.  It can take as long as a year or two, sometimes as little as four months, depending on the elders in the congregation and how ready they think the person is.  There's really no upside to baptism.  It just means you can be shunned by friends and family if you ever change your mind.  Anyways, in the next scene, the husband is out knocking on doors with his study buddy, Joe. ",

            "text": "Some people might be confused by the beer thing.  No, Jehovah's Witnesses aren't banned from drinking alcohol.  In fact, it's a problem in some congregations, because there's nothing to do as a Jehovah's Witness.  Most fun stuff is banned.  You can drink, but you can't get drunk.  A little tipsy is okay, but that doesn't stop some elders.  Anyways, as I was saying, this is a perfect illustration of how they change your personality.  They picked out one trait that most people can agree is bad, anger.  And they claim they fixed Joe's anger problem.  That might be the case.  Maybe Jehovah's Witnesses did dull his anger problem.  But this is a sign that the group is changing people's personalities.  Now, I hear you saying, that's a positive change.  Shouldn't that be congratulated?  That is a positive change.  But what did he have to give up to change it?  They weren't just trying to dull the dude's anger out of the goodness of their heart.  He had to accept a bunch of other personality changes along with it.  And he had to devote his entire life to this organization as payment.  He has to knock on doors for the rest of his life.  If he ever stops, he loses everything.  What's the key difference between a psychiatrist changing somebody's personality through cognitive behavioral therapy and Jehovah's Witnesses changing it by using the Bible?  Psychiatrists are ethically bound to help people with no ulterior motives or benefits.  This is the difference between constructive influence and destructive influence.  A therapist has an interest in helping you improve upon yourself for the sake of improvement and are encouraging you to use your conscience as a basis for your morality.  And Jehovah's Witnesses are using their doctrine as a basis for morality.  If you want to take on the personality changes they demand, then you'll end up with a cloned personality.  You'll be a perfect replica of every other Jehovah's Witness around the world.  That might not be so bad if their morality wasn't so absurd and grotesque in some ways.  For example, no gays allowed.

In this next part, one of the elders from the congregation can clearly see that the husband isn't really happy that his wife isn't spending all her time knocking on doors.  She wanted to have a career of her own so they could move into a bigger apartment.  An honest and worthy goal, in my opinion.  Nothing wrong with trying to improve on your living conditions.

This is bizarre, and it's another fine example of Jehovah's Witnesses trying to force people to have jobs rather than careers, and have Jehovah's Witnesses as a way of life rather than a hobby, and nothing else.  They don't want people focused on anything but spreading the good news.  They take over your life, adapt you into another clone of the organization, and make it so you can't leave, no matter what, or you lose everything and everybody you ever loved.  Is it worth it?  Is it worth giving up that anger problem when you could just as easily use cognitive behavioral therapy for that?  Is it worth giving up all of your worldly friends, giving up your hobbies, to become another clone?  I can't make that determination for anybody.  But I can tell you this, leaving the organization was the best decision I've ever made.  It poisons every part of your life.  The problems they claim to help you solve can be solved outside the religion, and the price you have to pay for Jehovah's Witnesses to solve it is not worth it.  So what happens next in the story?  Brother Williams comes over to the new apartment they just moved into to do what they call a shepherding call.  It probably isn't that formal.  More than likely, he wouldn't actually call it a shepherding call in this case.  Those happen when the person is on their way out the door in some really obvious way.  Like they have outside friends, or they go to the bar every week, or they got an ear piercing.  They went to a church service with a friend, even if it was just for a funeral or something.  That's not what's happening here.  These people still believe it to the bone.  So it's more of a friendly and concerned visit than a shepherding call, technically.  But he still feels like he needs to give them some motivation to stay in the religion and be broke as shit like they apparently were before.  Let's continue. ",

And anybody who refuses to fit that mold will be kicked out and never spoken to again.  Is it really worth it?  Is it really worth having your personality formed by these people?  Would you prefer this over normal therapy that respects individuality, human rights, and dignity?  This video was intended for active Jehovah's Witnesses that are already a part of the religion.  This wasn't really intended to be shown to people when you knock on their door.  The social cost of joining the religion is steep, so the only way they can bring in new members is by introducing the social costs gradually, over the course of a year or two.  Springing videos like this on any random person in the street will probably end badly, and they know that.  That's how cults survive and grow, by having a lower social cost, by making it a lot easier to fit into the group without having to change your personality very much.  By having a lower social cost, by making it a lot easier to fit into the group without having to change your personality very much, the group grows larger faster.  Having a higher social cost means they grow a lot slower, but the membership has high enthusiasm.  They're nearly impossible to deprogram.  Look at Scientology and Jehovah's Witnesses, for example.  The cost is a lot higher to be a member of Scientology.  Not only socially, but financially too.  It comes along with a lot of bizarre beliefs.  And it costs hundreds of thousands of dollars to climb the ladder.  With Jehovah's Witnesses, the upfront cost is zero.  All you have to do is express an interest in the religion.  Over the course of months and months, people volunteer their time to indoctrinate you and show you the good qualities that come along with the cult personality.  By the time you see this kind of thing, the sunk cost fallacy kicks in and you're more willing to accept it.  Scientology has about 50,000 members.  Jehovah's Witnesses have 8.5 million.  These groups are damaging, they're destructive, and they've put a lot of time and effort into making that difficult to recognize up front.  Anyways, that's all I've got for you.  If you like what I do and you want to see me continue to do it, you can support me in a few ways.  First, there's Patreon.  That's probably the best way.  But if you want to get something back for your support, you can check me out on Teespring.  Or you can check me out on Etsy.  I have a store where I sell all kinds of interesting stuff.  Mostly it's 3D printed game stands.  But I also sell these 2020 dumpster fire candle holders.  Or just regular dumpster fire candle holders.  And I sell these signs.  If you want to keep Jehovah's Witnesses or Mormons from knocking on your door, put these out front.  Jehovah's Witnesses aren't afraid of anything.  Except apostates.  And you don't have to be an ex-Jehovah's Witness to be an apostate.  The term applies to anybody critical of the religion.  So if you want to keep them away, then consider getting one of these signs.  All links can be found in the description and the pinned comment.  Okay, thanks for watching guys. ",
