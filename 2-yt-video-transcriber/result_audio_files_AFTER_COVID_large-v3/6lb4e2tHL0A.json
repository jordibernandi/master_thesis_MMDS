And he's created this meta narrative that he is a wartime president.  And if we recall about four weeks ago, he switched to that very hard right after everybody was criticizing him for being, you know, saying it was a hoax.  And then somebody told him, no, embrace this.  Call yourself a wartime president.  Say you're going to take tens of thousands of losses and be a commander in chief.  This man's utter incompetence, he would have been relieved in command.  And let me give you a historical example.  In the Revolutionary War, there was a general by the name of Charles Lee, Major General Charles Lee.  He was so utterly incompetent at the Battle of Monmouth, he was relieved of his command by George Washington.  The worst thing you can have happen in your entire life is to be relieved of your command in combat.  And if George Washington does it to you, you're really incompetent.
