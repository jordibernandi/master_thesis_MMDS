            "text": "We got a problem.  Right guys, very quick one here, but it's not something you'll see on the BBC, Sky News or any other mainstream broadcast media in the UK because they can't have you seeing that, which goes against their agenda to keep you doing as you're told like good little sheeple.  Now, usually we get spoon fed every single bit of news out of Europe by the EU loving lefty journalists, but not obviously when it's something to do with people standing up and saying no.  Some of you might have seen this video that was going around on Twitter and I actually retweeted with the intention of talking about today.  But I wanted to wait to see if the UK mainstream media actually picked up on it.  The Express newspaper did, but that is it from what I can actually tell.  The taxpayer-funded BBC is yet again missing in action with something that is actually worth reporting, or should be anyway.  If this march was stating how white people are essentially the devil, you can bet your bollocks to a barn dance.  the BBC would be all over it like a fly around shit.  As it's not, they're like a fart in the wind and you couldn't find them for the life of you.  Instead, the only ones to pick up on it were a few European outlets that did the usual smear jobs you would expect from the BBC.  Reuters, though, was not one of them, so we'll take a quick look at the video itself and, of course, Reuters' short article.  It headlines, Thousands march in Vienna against coronavirus restrictions.  Thousands of people marched through Vienna on Saturday to protest against restrictions on public life designed to curb the coronavirus pandemic.  Just as Chancellor Sebastian Kurz's government held talks about extending the measures, chanting demonstrators, many without masks held signs including Kurz must go and make influenza great again during marches through the city centre.  I can't fucking believe that.  make influenza great again.  i absolutely fucking love that.  that is great.  i'd actually like to know who fought that up.  that is really fucking funny and i'm expecting we'll really piss the media off.  if it gained any traction perhaps people need to run around saying it just so we can trigger some salt mining from the lefty toss pots.  as you know this is something i thoroughly enjoyed doing.  Austria, a country of 8.9 million people, is in its third lockdown with only essential shops open, and yet everyone's still in the same situation, much like we are.  There's no point in going on about that, it's not even about the protest anymore.  So like I said, a very short article indeed.  But the point of this video wasn't really the article, I only bothered reading it to you because of the Make Influenza Great Again comment.  The point of it is obviously the video that has been playing since I started reading the article, and you can see there now.  This is showing many people around Europe do not agree with this lunacy and governments overreaching, which is what they are doing.  The more people that stand up against it, the sooner it will stop, hopefully.  That is, of course, if they actually stop it.  There's no guarantee of that.  When governments get emergency laws, they don't like giving them up, let me tell you that much.  But obviously the BBC run around reporting on a load of bollocks that no one even cares about.  Of course they're pumping out fear porn 24-7 but they still do report on other news stories from time to time.  You would actually think they would report on things like this or you would expect them to but of course they won't because it goes against their agenda and they don't want people seeing this.  I expect that's the reason why they told football players to stop hugging each other when they score because it makes people remember what we used to do as human beings.  But I'm sure most of you noticed during that video that there was no police out there, batons out, ready to attack people protesting in the street.  This is something, obviously, that Austria has, the UK does not.  I find it rather fucking amazing that people can protest in Austria, but if you try to do that in the UK, the old bill around there, batons out, ready to give you a kicking.  Unless, of course, you are protesting for BLM, in which case they will just let you do it.  Though, obviously, they did arrest that Sasha Johnson tosspot the other day for being outside when she shouldn't be.  I expect only because they got told you'll be accused of two-tier policing, which, let's be honest, we know they do anyway.  But I will say it, well done to the people of Austria for standing up and saying no.  There is a pattern consistent throughout history of oppressed people turning on the oppressors.  Slaves against their owners.  The peasantry against the feudal barons.  Colonies, Mr Verhofstadt, against their empires.  And that is why Britain is leaving.  And it doesn't matter which language you use, we are going and we are glad to be going.  We're off! ",
