            "text": "Hello everybody, my name is Graham Elwood and you are watching The Political Vigilante.  One of the fine shirts that you guys send me through at the P.O.  Box.  I got a great one from A. Mayers in Iowa.  It says, I heart coming Iowa.  Don't know that I'm going to wear that one on the show, but I love it nonetheless.  Thank you for sending me stuff at the P.O.  Box.  If you go to GrahamElwood.com.  I also get some weird letters from some people.  Some people don't put their return addresses.  That gets a little whatever.  Oh, but nothing is as crazy as, gee, this.  Prince Andrew is tied to another child-abusing billionaire.  He visited a second tycoon facing child rape claims as fashion boss Peter Nygaard accused of abusing 10 teens.  This came out February 14th.  Hmm.  Fashion mogul Nygaard is alleged to have invited 10 girls to his lavish estate under the guise that he would help them with their modeling careers.  Boy, doesn't that sound familiar?  That's one of Jeffrey Epstein's scams.  And Jalene Maxwell and several other women were like his pimps, his recruiters.  They would, oh, we're going to make you famous.  You're going to have a great modeling career.  You're going to work for Mr.  Epstein.  He had fake modeling agencies.  But then there's a lot of ties that Les Wexner and Victoria's Secret is not... The cool, fun, sexy lingerie company, they had ties to it.  You know, Les Wexner, who, oh, he's disappearing.  He's in talks to step down.  This happened like the beginning of the month, like the end of January, huh?  Les Wexner, weird.  All this stuff is all kind of weirdly connected, right?  Prince Andrew was... reportedly stayed with a Nygaard's mansion in the Bahamas with ex-wife Sarah Ferguson in 2000.  This is from a British newspaper.  There's the two of them walking in 2000.  Peter Nygaard's Bahama mansion.  This is the mansion that these 10 women are claiming that they were raped in.  There's Sarah Ferguson with Nygaard.  This is how sex trafficking happens right out in the open.  Oh, he's a billionaire.  She's from the royal family.  We're not gonna question who these children are.  Interviews with people like Virginia Roberts Dufri and other women that have come forward.  Like, so one thing Virginia Roberts Dufri said in interviews, she's like, everyone's in on it.  Everybody knows.  the drivers, the doctors, the staff, the pilots, the friends, everybody knows.  Everybody knows about it.  It's weird that Prince Andrew is another billionaire pedophile is friends with Prince Andrew.  Huh, was he too honorable to break off this friendship?  like with Epstein, you know, when he lost his, remember Prince Andrew said in that interview, last year with the BBC that he lost his sweat glands in the war and wouldn't be caught dead without a sport coat in London.  Remember that?  This isn't me.  I wouldn't go to the Bahamas.  I remember I wasn't in the Bahamas that day because that was the day we went and got pizza.  A lawsuit filed in the Southern District of New York claimed that Nygaard piled plied his subjects with alcohol and drugs before they were violently assaulted, raped, and sodomized.  The class action lawsuit accuses Nygaard of sex trafficking and rape, all financed and facilitated by his family of corporations and their employees.  See what this is?  We've been talking about this since the Epstein thing broke last summer.  This is not one little.  Epstein was one bad apple and nobody knew about it.  Gee, the Clintons didn't know and Prince Andrew didn't know.  Complete bullshit.  That is complete bullshit.  You don't have a multi-billion dollar global sex trafficking ring and it's just one guy here and one guy there and nobody was aware of it.  The ruling class, the billionaire ruling class is in on this.  They're profiting from this.  Because here's Prince Andrew in 2010 with Jeffrey Epstein.  Right?  He couldn't have known.  He didn't know Epstein.  He didn't know about it.  There's Virginia Roberts as a child.  She's like 16 or something like that in this photo.  There's Jalene Maxwell.  There's Prince Andrew.  He's tried to claim that this photo was doctored.  I wouldn't put my hand there and I wouldn't be caught in London without a sport coat.  Right.  Pedophile.  So Virginia Roberts said she was raped by both of these two and trafficked.  And she said Jelene Maxwell was awful.  Where's Jelene Maxwell?  Oh, that's right.  I did a video how she's hiding out in Israel.  This is from the Jerusalem Post.  Not like Infowars or something.  The Jerusalem Post is saying this.  Daughter of late Jewish media mogul Robert Maxwell, which we also know was a Mossad agent, is being protected in a number of countries, including Israel.  It's weird.  Prince Andrew's name keeps coming up.  The FBI has been probing trying to find Jalene Maxwell.  Now, let's be clear here.  They're probing.  If they really wanted to find her, if the United States government wanted to find somebody, they could find her.  We spend the most money of any country on the face of the earth on surveillance.  We just don't know where she's at.  But this Prince Andrew, this Nygaard thing, the Prince Andrew thing is not going away.  Because here's what was said last month by the FBI in New York. ",

And to date, Prince Andrew has provided zero cooperation.  The original charges against Jeffrey Epstein contained a conspiracy charge, and we allege that there were conspirators involved.  And Jeffrey Epstein couldn't have done what he did without the assistance of others, and I can assure you that our investigation is moving forward. ",

            "text": "No cooperation.  No cooperation from Prince Andrew or the royal family.  They pulled him off of his royal family duties, you know, walking around, clipping stuff, making people feel less than because they weren't born into a pedophile sex trafficking ring.  Gee, why can't they find Jeline Maxwell?  There she is with now President Trump.  If Trump really wanted to find her, he would.  If Trump really wanted to get, um, Prince Andrew, he would.  He would have him arrested.  But we are so obsessed, and it's by design.  Oh, in the celebrity gossip, we're always talking about the royal family and the Merkel, and oh, they're hairy, they left, and oh, ooh.  There's like 100-some royal families throughout the world, if not more.  Why do we only talk about that one?  If Trump is such a tough guy and he's gonna drain the swamp, why can't he get this figured out?  Oh, cause he's friends with Jeline Maxwell.  Oh, there's Bloomberg.  Friends with Jeline Maxwell.  Boy, Bloomberg's really going after Trump.  Is he?  Is he?  Hmm.  Weird.  All buddies.  On Epstein's plane once, flight logs indicate.  On Epstein's plane 26 times.  All these court cases with Epstein and everything.  and now Nygaard are coming out of New York.  Two former mayors of New York.  Epstein hung himself with a paper t-shirt and the video footage just happened to get zoinked away.  Oh boy.  Two guards were, I don't know, online shopping or something like that.  In prisons in New York.  What?  If they wanted to get Jalene Maxwell, you're the president of the United States.  If you wanted to get Jalene Maxwell, you would.  They're all guilty.  Why aren't we finding Jalene Maxwell?  Why is it so hard to find her?  Here she is.  I found her at Chelsea Clinton's wedding.  There she is.  On Epstein's plane 26 times, Epstein's pimp and a pedophile herself.  Lolita Express air hostess who says she helped Bill Clinton pick out a bracelet for his daughter Chelsea during Jeffrey Epstein-funded jaunt to Africa reveals in court that she is one of the pedophile rape victims.  Here's a photo of her with Bill Clinton.  Why can't we find Jalene Maxwell?  Why is Prince Andrew another wacky coincidence?  It's funny, I don't have any friends that are pedophile sex traffickers, let alone two.  I don't have any friends that are billionaires.  Right?  So, you know, this is fake.  to just to go after Bernie.  This guy running in this Democratic primary just magically appears on the debate stage.  Seven months later, just appears.  Tulsi Gabbard doesn't qualify, Mike Gravel, no anti-war candidates, but this jackass does.  Got it.  Who hangs out with Jeline Maxwell.  Who's friends with Trump.  who's hiding in Israel, who trafficked children with Prince Andrew and Jeffrey Epstein.  And now, Peter Nygaard.  See how it's all coming to play?  Prince Andrew, they're divorced now, but Prince Andrew's wife at the time.  How come Rachel Maddow and them aren't talking about this?  Is it because they all work for big corporate media outlets that are owned by billionaires?  Like the head of ABC whose wife was friends with Jelene Maxwell?  The more you dig into this Epstein thing, the more it's like it's all horrifyingly connected.  Why is it so hard?  The only two people that have been arrested, that have even been charged since Epstein's murder, because we all know he didn't kill himself, were the guards, really the guards.  The billionaires, they're just running around free.  We can't find Jalene Maxwell.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Weird.  Huh.  Huh.  So weird.  Huh.  Can't really seem to figure out where anybody's at here.  Huh.  Another billionaire presidential candidate.  The president.  Two presidents and two mayors of New York.  You know, the biggest city in America where all of this money is located.  The Wall Street and all this money and power.  Huh.  Can't seem to find Jalene Maxwell.  I'm not letting this go, because the billionaire ruling class, they need to be hunted down, hunted down.  The billionaire pedophile sex trafficking ruling class is guilty.  The 99%, 99% of the whole world is innocent until proven guilty.  That is a great, that democratic legal system, innocent until proven, I firmly believe in that.  Not for billionaire pedophiles.  They're guilty.  They're guilty until they give up information on their other billionaire friends and other pedophile sex traffickers.  And then we take, we freeze all their, we grab their assets and give it to their victims.  And then they get to choose between being executed or spending the rest of their life in jail.  And we'll let them choose.  Like that's fair.  That seems fair.  Maybe we'll do a coin toss like the Iowa caucuses.  If they don't cooperate, that's why we keep Guantanamo Bay open.  Yeah, I don't think torturing people is right at all.  But billionaire sex trafficking pedophiles, they're vermin.  They're diseased rats.  And I'm sorry, that's an insult to the rat community.  And I apologize to the rat community.  Hmm.  Hmm.  This is the ruling class, folks.  Two presidents, two different political parties, the royal family, several royal families.  The world is run by pedophiles, which is a horrifying thing to think about, but it's the reality, and we need to do something about it.  We really do.  Thanks for watching the show, folks.  They're not really covering this, hun.  Is Sean Hannity getting bent out of shape every night about this?  He'll just talk about Bill Clinton's involvement.  He won't talk about Trump's involvement.  No.  I hate that one-sided bullshit.  There's no difference.  This is American politics.  There's one party.  It's like the old saying, Ralph Nader.  I think Ralph Nader said he asked his dad, do you think someday we'll have a third party?  And he goes, son, I'd settle for a second.  We have one party.  All these guys, they both, he's been a Republican and a Democrat.  He was a Democrat.  Now he's a Republican.  He's always been a Democrat, but he's been, I mean, his policies are all Republican.
