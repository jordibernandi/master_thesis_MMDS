            "text": "The rhetoric of the left undermines our justice system, with Nancy Pelosi calling them stormtroopers, Jim Clyburn calling them the Gestapo, and Wheeler using the term paramilitary forces.  Under President Trump, violent crime rates in America finally began to fall.  Rhetoric like this cannot be allowed to set us back.  augmenting the federal protective service, guarding federal property in Portland.  Our brave officers have, since augmenting them, I should say, our brave officers have faced all of these various things, like rioters barricading officers inside the Hatfield Federal Courthouse, trapping officers inside.  A, quote, commercial-grade mortar firework was launched by rioters.  A federal agent's hand was impaled by planted nails.  Another federal agent was shot with a pellet gun, leaving a wound deep to the bone, and tragically, three federal officers were likely left permanently blinded by the rioters using lasers pointed directly at their eyes.  These are not the actions of so-called peaceful protesters, and the Trump administration will not stand by and allow anarchy in our streets.  Law and order will prevail, and I have a short video for you because I want it to be real what is happening right now in Portland.  So if we could play that video, that'd be great.  Come on!  Come on!  I hope someone burns down your whole precinct with all y'all inside.  Can't wait to see it.  As you can see, that is anything but a peaceful protest and this president will always stand on the side of law and order. ",
