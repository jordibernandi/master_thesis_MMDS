            "text": "Mr.  Trump has asked me to hold this glamorous presser to talk about all the voter fraud that has happened in this election.  We're talking thousands.  No, make that millions.  Yeah.  millions or maybe even billions of fake ballots, but only for Biden.  All the Trump ballots were perfect, and no ballot, not even one, had a defect in the races where Republicans won Senate and House seats.  Those millions of ballots were all perfect, like Jesus.  How?  Well, a miracle glory!  What was that?  Do I have evidence of fraud?  What a silly thing to ask.  Would Mr.  Trump say something without evidence?  What's that?  Reveal the evidence?  I'd really like to, but funny story, Tucker Carlson put the only copy of all the evidence on a flash drive and UPSed it to himself.  And well, you'll never guess, but evidence of election fraud is sorta like Jesus.  You have to believe in it without seeing it.  Otherwise you have no faith.  And I don't want to live in that kind of country. ",
