And a lot of you said, no, it's happening.  Okay.  We are partially reopening Mar-a-Lago, my great property in Florida.  Thanks to the great leadership, by the way, of a very talented governor, Ron DeSantis.  We love this guy.  He's doing great things.  And so we're reopening it partially.  Whites only is going to be the partial reopen.  Okay.  And it's OK.  It's not.  Excuse me.  No, no.  You're asking a nasty question.  Racist.  Is that a right?  It's not a racist policy.  I'm the least racist person.  Pretty in this room, for sure, because some of you have said some very nasty things about great blacks like Candace Owens and Angry Hootie, the sheriff from Wisconsin.  That's what we call an angry hoodie.  You've said nasty things about these great blacks just because they support me.  and like hate their own people.  And that's okay, they're allowed to.  It's like the N-word.  Whites can't say it, but if the blacks hate each other, you can't do anything about it.  It's just like, it's like the rap albums, okay?  But Mar-a-Lago is open, partially, for health.  We're not letting the groups that are getting like sicker in at first.  It's a total, you say listen to the doctors, Sir, you should listen to Fauci and Burks with their scarves.  But now we're listening.  And they say these communities of color, you heard this phrase?  They're getting affected more.  So we're asking them nicely.  We're doing it very nicely.  Mike, didn't I say, I said to that Mexican man to get the hell off of my Mar-a-Lago property, please.  I said, please.  Mike knows.  I said, please.  Not to you.  I won't say please to you.  You're nasty.  But we're reopening it.  Mexican and black staff can come.  They have to maintain 60 feet social distancing.  But that was always the policy at Mar-a-Lago.  So nothing's changed there.  So it's not racist.  It's called a celebration.  White MAGA hat.  Mar-a-Lago.  Partial reopen. ",
