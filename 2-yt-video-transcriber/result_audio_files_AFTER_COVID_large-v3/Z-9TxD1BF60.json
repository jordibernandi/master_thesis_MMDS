And Dr.  MacArthur, you were scheduled to be with us, and so thankful that from Los Angeles you're joining us to really talk through the current situation.  and to bring some context to what Christians are facing in this day.  And so maybe just starting from a big picture perspective, what should the church right now be thinking about this global health crisis? ",

We know where we're headed.  Eternity is settled for us.  Far better to depart and be with Christ so that the worst that could ever happen to us would be the best that could ever happen.  And I think this is a time for us to make manifest our faith.  And yesterday was Sunday for us and we weren't allowed to have anybody here but I preached anyway in Matthew 6 where Jesus three times said, stop worrying.  Why are you worrying about your life, your food, your drink?  your clothing, your Heavenly Father knows you have need of all these things.  And the Psalms are just full of divine promises that God is our refuge and our strength.  So this is an opportunity for Christian people who say they trust in the Lord and they put their faith in Jesus Christ to demonstrate that by being stable and even hopeful and even joyful.  The kingdom of God is joy in the Holy Spirit and this is a great time for that.  This isn't like the Black Death.  I told our people 75 million people died in the Black Death and one writer said that the bodies were stacked like lasagna.  Some Italian writer said that.  It was a horrific time.  And of course every year 60 million people die around the world.  Death is not new to us.  So we should be the people who have no fear.  We should be without fear because our trust is in the Lord and this is an opportunity for us to declare That if you have no hope and if you have fear, and all people do when it comes to controlling their life and particularly their death, this is a great time for us to be the living testimony of what true faith in the Lord looks like.

            "text": "Yeah, there's absolutely no question about that.  I was thinking back of the times when I've had to deal with some kind of global or national problem.  going back to a massive earthquake that we had here called the Northridge earthquake.  People came into our church panicked because this was really a severe earthquake and we were able to address that.  There was what were called the Watts Riots, you may remember those that happened here in LA and we addressed the evil of mankind and went to the gospel.  When the Gulf War broke out, I did a series on what the Bible says about war and how how fragile life is.  and then maybe the big one was 9-11 and I ended up not only preaching a message on that but before I knew it I was on the Larry King show and the question asked what is the lesson of all this?  and I said the lesson is you're not in control of your death.  it could happen anytime and you need to be ready.  and we were able to give the gospel on CNN and it kept going and going.  so absolutely I think the fear of death is real and it's legitimate if you have no hope.  If you're just wishing for the best after you die and you're not in control of your death, that's a terrifying reality.  So this is the time for us to speak of the gospel and the security we have in Christ and the eternal life that he promises those who put their trust in him.  This is a great gospel opportunity.  And even though it's not the kind of plague where millions and millions of people are going to die, it still brings up the issue of the fact that you're not in control of your life and you could be one who dies in this situation and that specter hangs over people's head.  This is a perfect opportunity for us to declare the gospel. ",

            "text": "Yeah, this is a great follow-up question to what I was just saying.  This is when we need to show the joy in the Holy Spirit that Paul talks about in Romans 14.  This is when we need to show the peace that passes all understanding in our hearts because because we know we're locked into an eternal redemption and we have an eternal inheritance laid up for us in heaven.  This is the time for Christians to have joy, to demonstrate peace, to declare their faith.  And also, and I've been thinking a lot about this, in fact this was the message I would have given at the conference, that we need to proclaim the gospel of Jesus Christ.  I think for many people, they think of the responsibility to witness, to give the gospel as kind of a confrontation and can be a little bit, I don't know, off-putting that you're gonna confront somebody and you see examples of evangelism where you go to somebody and you nail them to the law and you start an argument and a debate.  But when you go to the scripture, It's very different.  We're not called by the Great Commission to have some kind of an argument or even some kind of evidentiary presentation with the gospel.  We're called to proclaim the gospel.  This goes back even to the Old Testament, declare his glory among the nations, his wonders among all people.  I think this is the time for us not to decide whether we can win the argument with a non-believer, but to take the opportunity to declare the gospel.  You know, there's a verb in the New Testament that's used many, many times, keruso.  It's translated a number of different ways, but it basically means to herald.  Without newspapers, authorities would send a herald into town and he would declare a message from the authorities to the people.  That's how we need to present the gospel.  It isn't that we're looking for some kind of argument or debate.  You just herald the gospel of Jesus Christ.  And in Acts 13, I think it's so interesting, that's what they did.  They declared the gospel.  And it says in the next verse, and as many as were appointed unto eternal life believed. ",

            "text": "Yeah obviously that is completely lost on our culture, a culture that murders babies wouldn't have any adequate or accurate assessment of the value of human life.  It's an oddity, isn't it, Chris, that they're advocating abortion at almost ramped up prior to this coming election.  at the same time they're trying to save old people.  from the flu.  There's such a confused understanding of human dignity and the image of God.  Again, this is the opportunity for believers to declare the truth.  And I would play off of that and say, look, everybody is in a panic that old people might die but don't seem to be disturbed to slaughter babies in the womb.  What is this?  If human life has any value at all, you would think they would more value to that beginning life than at the very end of life.  But this is the confusion of a godless culture.  So I think we would start by reiterating the dignity of life and remind people that there's something innate in us that understands that.  And that's why we see something like this virus, even though it's not lethal at a high percentage.  The thought that people might die disturbs us.  Why doesn't it disturb us that they're being slaughtered in the womb?  I think this is an opportunity for us to make the connection. ",

            "text": "Well, look, that is the motivation.  The motivation for us to live a holy life is that Christ is in us and we are in Christ.  There's no higher motivation than that.  If we're motivated by anything other than the honor of Christ and the glory of God, that's a secondary or tertiary motivation.  Everything should be for the love of the Lord.  Everything should be for the honor of the Lord.  Whatever you do, whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all to the glory of God.  All things are by him, all things are for him.  The end of all things, even evangelism, it says in John and Romans, is for the sake of the name, for the glory of the name of the Lord.  So I think we have to understand that God is having justified us and transformed us and begun the process of sanctification.  God is conforming us to the image of His Son by the Holy Spirit, 2 Corinthians 3.18.  Everything that comes our way, by the way, even this kind of thing, as James would say, count it all joy when you fall into various trials because they have a perfecting work.  This is all part, for the believer, of the conditions in life that maybe we wouldn't choose but that God uses as part of our perfection, part of our move toward Christlikeness.  So I think we embrace these things.  I can go back in my pastoral ministry, and I've said this to our people many times, The most difficult personal times in my life, whether it was an illness or whether it was a disaster or whatever it was, the most difficult times in my life personally have been the times when there is the most evident expression of the power and the presence of the Lord.  So these are the best of times.  I even tell pastors, embrace trouble, embrace tribulation, because this is God doing his best work in your heart.  and drawing you near to  Him.\".  And I think believers in this hour need to look at this as God perfecting them, God maybe trimming off some unnecessary things, maybe lessening their preoccupation with what is temporal because it is so fragile and so temporary.  So the Lord is perfecting you if you're His child.  Embrace the trouble and find in that trouble the hand of the Lord moving you more toward the Lord Jesus Christ.  And again, one of the things that is going to become very fresh to us is the idea that we're not in control of all the elements of our lives.  And we can hold a lot of things much more lightly than we do.  We hold sometimes a death grip on temporal things.  This is a good time to reassess that. ",

            "text": "I like to compare the doctrine of providence to miracles.  A miracle is when God suspends natural law.  to do something outside of natural law and without natural law and against the grain of natural law, that's a miracle.  Walking on water, whatever it is, raising dead people, whatever our Lord did, that suspends natural law and supernaturally invades time and space and acts in a divine way that has no human explanation.  Providence, in my mind, is a greater miracle than a miracle because it is God accomplishing his own ends and his own purposes not by suspending natural law but by taking all the elements of natural law and blending them together in a masterful way that he achieves his purpose but never interrupts what is the natural and normal course of things.  This is providence.  It is God not suspending circumstances and acting.  It is God taking all the contingencies, all the actors and all their activities and all their thoughts and words, and somehow out of all of that, pulling it together to create exactly what he wills to do.  That is a far more massive miracle than just suspending natural law and acting.  I look at my life, and I know you do, Chris, as well, and I know R.C.  did.  Every day I see that.  Every day of my life is a day full of providence.  And it's a different providence every day.  It's something, wow, how did that happen?  Whatever made those circumstances come together to bring it to this point?  We live in the, I think the most thrilling thing about the Christian life is providence.  Just seeing it unfold day in and day out.  And if you're in tune with the Lord and in tune with his word, you're really seeing it unfold.  And you see God at work in ways that have no human explanation. ",

This is a perfect opportunity to speak to them about eternity, about eternal life, about the forgiveness of sin, about heaven, and about hell, and about eternal punishment.  Because any time the culture's fear level is elevated, this is when Christians want to stand up and, as I said earlier, be joyful, full of peace, full of faith, happy, thankful, grateful, anticipating that it would be far better to depart and be with Christ, but he wants us to stay so we can declare his glory among the nations, his wonders among all people.
