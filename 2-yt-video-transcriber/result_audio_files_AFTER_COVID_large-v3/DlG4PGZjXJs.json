That's what he said.  Oh, the camera's on me now.  That won't be as funny as that last bit.  Just so you know, you know.  Well, good evening, Mr.  President, Mrs.  First Lady, and the distinguished members of the radio and television correspondents' dinner, you know.  When I accepted the honor of performing here tonight, one thought crossed my mind, and that was, please, God, don't let me bomb in front of the President.  But I'm not worried.  What the hell do I care?  I worked on all my jokes.  I got a lot of help from my joke writer, Don Imus.  He helped me a lot.  Are you familiar?  You know this guy?  He's a funny guy.  He wrote some jokes.  Anyways, the dinner was great.  Did you enjoy the dinner?  We had some salmon.  It was delicious.  It was great.  I thought it was refreshing to see Democrats serve something other than subpoenas for a change.  I thought that was nice, you know?  I'll be doing some jokes later.  I just thought I'd... But you know, it is rather daunting to me.  I'm just a guy, you know?  What the hell am I?  And here I am, you know, I look out, I see President Bill Clinton, you know, I see Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, you know, media mogul Rupert Murdoch, you know, broadcast legend Larry King, you know, pornographer Larry Flint, you know.  Dick Morris.  The list is starting to drop off a little, folks, but still, you get the idea.  It's daunting.  You know, of course, they say the White House is haunted.  Did you know that?  And I thought this was kind of sad.  I heard last night that President Clinton charged Abraham Lincoln's ghost $10,000 to sleep in his own bed.  So that's... That doesn't seem right to me, you know?  I mean... But look, the president, you know, has come under a lot of fire for raising money, but, you know, he's good at it.  He's good at raising money.  That's not a bad thing.  Every president's done it.  It's just that President Clinton is very, very, very good at it.  Do you know he has organized in the past year over 100 fundraising dinners and over 200 fundraising midnight snacks?  Did you know that?  Is he laughing?  You've got to hand it to the president.  His injury is not holding him back from doing the business of the nation.  In fact, he just nominated Major General... Claudia Kennedy as the Army's first female three-star general.  I think that's great, you know.  She's doing a great job, but apparently the only thing she's having trouble with is she's having difficulty figuring out how to sexually harass herself.  She doesn't know how to... What's that?  That guy yells my name for no reason.  Thank you. ",
