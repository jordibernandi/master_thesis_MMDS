            "text": "Shalom, I'm Messianic Rabbi Zef Porat.  We're living in the most exciting and prophetic times since the first coming of Jesus Yeshua.  We're not setting any dates, but we know that the time is near.  We know that the veil is being lifted, 2 Corinthians 3.16, and Jews and Arabs are being saved in Israel like never before, Joel 2.28.  And afterward, I will pour out my spirit on all people.  Your sons and your daughters will prophesy.  Your old men will dream dreams.  Your young men will see visions.  In the midst of the attack of the enemy with this coronavirus, in the midst of the panic in the world, in the midst of governments trying to close down streets, trying to close down countries, trying to close down the people, in the midst of all this, God is moving.  Souls are being saved.  People are waking up and asking questions.  Why is this happening?  And the gospel is going forth.  Our ministry shares the gospel everywhere in Israel.  And we have many, many relationships with rabbis, chief rabbis, Orthodox Jews in the midst of persecution.  One of the former chief rabbis of Israel, Rabbi Eliyahu Bakshi Doron, passed away today at the age of 79.  He died from the coronavirus.  Our ministry has had a very long-term relationship with Rabbi Bakshi Doron as we've been preaching the gospel to him.  He's also received a copy of the book, the rabbi, the secret message, and the identity of the Messiah.  And just like Rabbi Yitzchak Adori believed that Yeshua is the Messiah, we also believe that Rabbi Eliyahu Doron Bakshi believed that Yeshua is the Messiah.  And many, many other rabbis will come to know that Yeshua is the Messiah as we will continue to preach the gospel to his family members, to his students, and to all Israel.  Rabbi Eliyahu Bakshi Doron never denied that Yeshua was the Messiah.  He never called on the name of Yeshua, not publicly, but he was fascinated to hear about the Bible verses, fascinated to hear about his dear friend, Rabbi Yitzhak Aduri, who believed that Yeshua is the Messiah.  As being one of the former chief rabbis of Israel, it was very difficult for him to go and ask questions in the yeshivot, which is the ministry school for rabbis.  So I was put in position, praise Yeshua, to comfort him and to share the gospel with him.  We did a lot of Bible studies online because of his position.  We did meet from time to time, but mostly it was done online via GoToMeeting and private links and things that we did together.  At the end of the day, it's not about what we do.  It's about what the Holy Spirit does.  Our job is to preach the gospel.  We believe.  that Rabbi Bakshi Doron is saved and called on the name of Yeshua.  As he was on his deathbed, he did not deny the name of Yeshua, Jesus.  What's even more encouraging is the will that he left.  I have here on the screen a news article that was released today.  And in the news article, here's what it writes.  Rabbi Bakshi Doron asked not to cry in his funeral, that he's in the presence of God.  And he asked to read a psalm at his funeral.  And I'm going to read that psalm right now that he asked to read.  And he said that the final Yom Kippur, which is the Day of Atonement, has been fulfilled.  We don't know if he believed in Yeshua or not, but he certainly gave here enough clues to determine that he did believe in Yeshua.  Request number one, he asked not to cry in his funeral, but rejoice, for he's together with the Lord.  Request number two, he asked to read Psalms chapter 18, verse 16.  Rabbis in Israel, especially in his position, don't ask to read those type of Bible verses at a funeral.  This is another indication that he may have believed that Yeshua is the Messiah.  One thing is certain.  The Holy Spirit is moving in Israel and around the world.  As we know, the Bible says in Romans chapter 10, verse 17, that faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God.  We pray that many that will hear this Bible verse and question, why did the rabbi ask us to read this psalm?  Why did he say rejoice?  Why did he say do not weep?  Could it be that he knew that Yeshua, Jesus, is the Messiah.  We pray, yes.  I grew up as an Orthodox Jew before.  I believed in Yeshua, Jesus, as the King of Kings and Lord of Lords.  What Rabbi Eliyahu Bakshi Doron did was not only unusual, but it was supernatural.  It is almost impossible for a rabbi of his position to do what he did.  to jeopardize his reputation by leaving these type of instructions.  Instead of reading the rabbinic prayer from the rabbinic prayer book, he chooses to leave the Word of God, read Psalms.  Now, I'm not saying that they didn't read it from a rabbinic book in his funeral.  Of course they did, because there are other rabbis there that don't believe in Jesus, don't believe in Yeshua.  but he left instructions to read from the Psalms.  And that's supernatural.  What's even more supernatural is that this happened in Passover, the unleavened bread season, exactly the time where the gospel can go forth, that we can continue to preach the gospel here in Israel using what the rabbi left as an instruction.  God's word shall not return void.  Let's continue and stand in prayer together.  One thing is certain, for Zion's sake, we will not keep silent.  Isaiah 62 verse 1.  For Zion's sake, I will not keep silent.  For Jerusalem's sake, I will not remain quiet.  Till her vindication shines out like the dawn, her salvation like a blazing torch.  And the word for salvation in Hebrew is Jesus, Yeshua.  Her Yeshua like a blazing torch.  That blazing torch is going forth right now in the Feast of the Lord.  right now in Unleavened Bread as we're moving towards Pentecost, Shavuot, the giving and the power of the Wach HaKodesh, the Holy Spirit.  May that Holy Spirit continue to fall on Israel and the nations as we're getting closer to the second coming of Jesus Yeshua.  Let's continue to stand together as the one new man, Ephesians 2.15, bring the gospel back to Jerusalem and go home.  Until next time, I'm Messianic Rabbi Zev Porah, sending you blessings from Yerushalayim, from Jerusalem, Israel, in the Feast of Unleavened Bread, in the mighty name of the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, Al Yehuda, the Lion of the Tribe of Judah, Jesus Yeshua.  Amen.  Happy Passover and Unleavened Bread from Israel.  Shalom. ",
