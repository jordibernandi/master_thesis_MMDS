            "text": "Hi folks, I'm Steve Hindy with Showing Animals Respect and Kindness.  One largely overlooked component of rodeo animal abuse is barrel racing.  At first, barrel racing may seem like the contestant and horse are working together to achieve a common goal.  But look more closely.  Many of these horses are violently spurred.  Watch the rider's feet.  Her toes are pointed out, which means that her spurs are pointed in.  The horse's ribs are being viciously hammered.  The spurs aren't sharp, but they don't have to be to cause an enormous amount of pain and blunt force damage resulting in extensive bruising and hemorrhaging under the skin.  Dr.  Peggy Larson is a large animal veterinarian and a former rodeo rider who has treated rodeo animal injuries.  We showed Dr.  Larson video clips of horses being spurred in barrel racing.  This is her observation. ",

            "text": "The spurs used in barrel racing are blunt, not sharp.  But blunt hurts as bad or worse than sharp.  It's the difference between poking your finger with a needle or hitting it with a hammer.  The spurs are slammed hard.  Due to the distance between the spur and the belly, the slam would easily exceed 30 pounds. ",

Barrel racing used to be a friendly competition.  What changed to make it an activity that abuses horses?  Like everything else at his rodeo, corporate sponsors have driven the financial stakes through the roof, and it is the horses who are paying the price.

            "text": "There are still people who are involved in barrel racing because they love working and playing with their animals.  But in the world of professional rodeo, the focus is on extracting every ounce of performance possible out of the horses.  And those horses are paying a very high price.  Barrel racing has also been plagued by charges that horses are being drugged, both to enhance their performance and to cover up injuries.  Of course, covering up injuries with drugs only exacerbates the damage.  While some contestants have long pushed for drug testing, this is largely resisted by the big money people in the event.  Why do you think that may be?  If you care about animals, please do not attend rodeos.  And don't do business with unethical corporate sponsors such as Coca-Cola, Best Buy, Discount Tires, and Coors Beer.  I'm Steve Hindy for Showing Animals Respect and Kindness. ",
