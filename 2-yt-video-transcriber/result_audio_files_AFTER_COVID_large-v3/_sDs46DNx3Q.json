            "text": "So by now, I'm sure that you've seen at least one viral video featuring a Donald Trump supporter melting down and claiming that the results of the election are illegitimate.  Because of course, since Donald Trump is saying it, by definition, it has to be true because everything he says is gospel if you are a Donald Trump supporter.  Now, listen, I think that most people who support Donald Trump, they probably have already reckoned with the fact that it's over for him.  But there's a portion of the population who support Donald Trump who are diehards.  They're part of this MAGA cult.  And anything that he says, they think it basically is as good as gospel.  And I don't mean that to be hyperbolic.  I mean that because they hang on every single word that he says.  So if the president says this election was fraudulent, even if there is zero evidence, they're going to regurgitate exactly what he says.  So we've seen the videos, but we haven't really seen anyone speak to these people and ask them why they think this election is fraudulent.  And this video from CNN features a reporter who actually went to one of these so-called Stop the Steal protests and talked to them.  And I want to see what they have to say, because... I think this is important.  These are folks who actually believe the election was stolen.  So when they're asked for evidence, what are they going to say?  So let's see.  Oh, and I didn't have.  There we go.  Call stop the steel protests.  seen as Donio Sullivan asked some demonstrators in Pennsylvania why they think incorrectly the election was stolen. ",

Sometimes it takes a while.  It's going to take longer because there's a lot of mail-in ballots.  We're pretty quick at counting them in Oregon because we've been doing it here for years.  But, I mean, no state certifies the results of the election right away.  It takes a while.  So the fact that you're proposing that it's nefarious that they're counting the votes and it's taking time... I mean, this lady is just stupid.

I wonder, do these people think that... Republicans stole the House and the Senate, or is it only a stolen election because it's one that didn't go their way?  Like, did Democrats just rig it enough to steal the presidential election but didn't bother to steal the House?  I mean, they lost ground in the House.  We don't know if Democrats are going to take control of the Senate.  Democrats lost in a key state against Mitch McConnell.  I guess they forgot to rig that one.  Is it only a rigged election if it doesn't go your way?  Like, I'm just curious because there's zero evidence, zero evidence that it's been stolen.  They're just citing what Donald Trump said as evidence.  And that's not evidence because Donald Trump can't even articulate why he believes the election has been stolen.  All of a sudden, now we're hearing about all of these illegal votes that have been cast.  What is an illegal vote?  What does that mean?  He's implying that, oh, well, dead people are voting.  No, that's not happening.  The voter fraud rate is 0.0025%.  It is statistically insignificant.  So to the extent that voter fraud exists, it is not anywhere near enough to actually tilt the election.  And the reason why voter fraud isn't a common phenomenon is because there's very little payoff.  It's a felony.  So you're going to commit voter fraud to get an extra three votes for some shitty politician?  Who's going to want to do that?  I mean, it happens once in a while, but it's not like.  it only benefits Democrats.  Sometimes Republicans commit voter fraud, but I don't even worry about that because, again, the number is so small that it is statistically insignificant.  So this is not an issue.  Voter fraud is something that Republicans talk about because they want to use it as a justification to do voter suppression, limit the number of polling stations, purge people from the voting rolls illegally.  That's what this is about.  And these suckers eat it up because they don't know any better. ",

It's a lost fucking cause.  Don't let dead people vote.  Dead people are not voting, jackass.  Just because Donald Trump said it doesn't make it a reality.

I'm honestly shocked that they even were willing to speak to someone with the camera, a reporter, because oftentimes they are hostile towards the media.  But I think that because he didn't have like any CNN or logo on him, at least that I saw, that kind of gave him plausible deniability.  But these people, they don't care.  Like they've come to the conclusion that based on their emotions, not on facts.  So presenting them with that evidence, like it's not going to do anything because this isn't a group of people who are operating, you know, using logic or they're not persuadable.  It doesn't matter what you show them.  It doesn't matter.  They've arrived at that conclusion.  And the only thing that can change their mind is if Donald Trump were to say, I was wrong.  It wasn't stolen, guys.  I was lying because I wanted the safe face in case I lost because it would be embarrassing.  I don't want to be a one-term president.  But he's not going to do that.  So as a result, these folks are going to believe everything that he says because they hang on to every single word that he says because this is a large fucking cult.  And yeah, that's that's that.  There's nothing left to say about this.  It is super depressing that we have so many Americans in this country who literally could not care less about facts or data and evidence.  But if you if you ask them about that, they'd say, oh, well, no, you don't care about facts.  The fact is that this election was stolen.  So we're like living in George Orwell's 1984.  And if I say that, they would cite Orwell and that I'm the reason why we're in George Orwell's 1984.  Like, words don't mean anything.  We're in a post-factual era.  The best that we can do is hope that people come to their senses and try to not be so gullible and duped by politicians who don't care about them.  They just care about their own asses.  And until that happens... yeah we're gonna get situations like this where we have the dumbest people rise to power and they still have this like huge base of support.  that's incredibly enthusiastic and will never abandon them no matter what it's.  it sucks.  but um you know it's a fact of reality.
