It's my right, it's your right to access the information held by the government and Sheriff Troy Nels, but the Republicans are trying to make it very difficult.  Now corrupt government officials are not required to respond to a written request for public information unless the request is received at a specified address by hand delivery or by another method of their choosing.  However, that hand delivery remains the tried and true secure way to submit your request.  And that's just what I did.  This story affects all of you.  Fort Bend County Sheriff Troy Nails is running for Congress.  He wants to be your next United States Congressman, where he'll set the public policy, have widespread influence over not just foreign policy, policing policy, and everything in between.  So this matters to all of you.  And will he provide access for public information, or will we expect only more games out of the Fort Bend County Sheriff's Office?  There's more coverage to come on Congressional Canada and Sheriff Toynells.  We're going to talk about how the Sheriff's Office is run and managed.  We'll talk about the Bronze Stars.  All of that will be coming in future videos, so please be sure to enable all notifications, subscribe to my channel, hit the thumbs up, hey, or the thumbs down, either way.  Leave the comment.  I want to know, what do you think?  Will he run and hide like the Almost Park Police Department?  Or will he promptly release his communications and the information about what his sheriff's office has been up to?  Thanks for watching. ",
