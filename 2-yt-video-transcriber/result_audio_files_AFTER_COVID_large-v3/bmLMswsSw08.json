I hope you all saw the news that we won two counts in a summary judgment motion.  That's to say a federal judge dismissed two counts against us in the Democracy Partners case, but we will be going to trial later this year.  This is all part of a coordinated attack against us.  Lauren Windsor, one of Bob Creamer's associates, has been working with, coordinating with, a number of plaintiffs to try to initiate lawfare against us.  We've won many of those lawsuits.  But again, we're going to trial.  Now, what's interesting about this case is that it's all part of an amazing story because we have so many deposition tapes of people like Lauren Windsor and their admissions in these deposition tapes.  Now, previously, I said I was going to release all of this maybe later in the year, maybe even after the trial.  But no, we've changed our minds.  We're going to start releasing some of it.  right now.  We want to show you who these people really are, in their own words, under oath.  They probably didn't expect this part of the process, but this is what happens when you sue us. ",

The effort was paid for by the Democratic National Party in collaboration with Hillary Clinton.  A few months after our release, January 2017, Lauren Windsor and associate of hers, Ryan Clayton, attacked one of our undercover journalists at night on the streets of Washington, D.C This was a frightening and unprovoked attack.  Our journalist was chased down the street, verbally abused, and when she got into a cab trying to escape, One of her pursuers, Ryan Clayton, followed her into the cab.  Please lock the doors.  Please lock the doors.  Lock them, lock them, lock them.  Don't let them in.  Oh, come on, man.  How's it going, man?  Our journalist finally found safe refuge in a hotel, but even as she entered the lobby, the crude verbal abuse continued.  You know what?  You're the bad guy.  Excuse me?  You're the bad guy.  You've been creamed!  Creamed!  Creamed!  That's a bitch!  So this attack on Allison Moss, our journalist and reporter, 21 years old, was utterly inexcusable.  It was disgusting.  It was abusive.  But the irony of it was that Lauren Windsor was pretty proud of it.  She released a tape of it.  But the tape she released was edited down.  You see, she was actually guilty of the very thing that they project onto us.  Selective editing, deceptive editing.  What's interesting about the tape that Lauren Windsor released is that she edited out the part where they said, quote, gotcha bitch.  They edited out the part where they said, quote, you've been creamed.  And perhaps most outrageous of all, Lauren Windsor and team edited out the part where Ryan Clayton got into the cab with the 21-year-old reporter working for Project Veritas and verbally berated her.  See, they edited all that stuff out.  And it's fascinating to see how Lauren Windsor responded to these accusations or realities of editing in her under oath deposition. ",
