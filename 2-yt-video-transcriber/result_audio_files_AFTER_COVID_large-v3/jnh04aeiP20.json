So if I punch this one until it breaks, that just gives me an excuse to get the new one, right?  So this video is called Natural Selection.  Why you should believe in creation and not evolution.  I'm guessing from the title that he's going to spend most of it talking about natural selection in isolation and pretending that it's taught as though that's all there is to evolution.  So let's take a look.  Thank you. ",

There is the theory of evolution, which is the body of scientific knowledge that covers everything that has anything to do with evolution from mutations to natural selection to the study of species distribution, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.  There are parts of the theory that are not fully understood and parts that are very well understood.  Now, the theory of evolution also contains the fact of evolution.  The fact of evolution is just the boring observation that allele frequencies change in a population over time.  That's all evolution really is, and even creationists can usually agree that this is a thing.  The disagreement comes with the idea that these changes can accumulate.  For some reason, creationists just seem to think that baby steps can't possibly add up to a total kilometer walked over time. ",

Chromosomes and individual genes themselves can duplicate as well.  And then there's the retroviruses that insert their genomes into other organisms genomes.

But natural selection is there to provide pressure that filters out variants that have less success.  And since I'm pretty sure you're about to talk about mutations and genetics in a moment, Darwin is irrelevant here.  Darwin didn't know about genetics.  He just knew that offspring were different from their parents.  He did not know the source of those differences.  Knowing the source has helped us greatly in our understanding of evolution.  But in Darwin's time, it was a mystery, though if he had known about Mendel's work in 1863, he might have had the beginnings of understanding. ",

That is a mutation in the gene that produces the protein TRIM5 that essentially tacks a defunct protein onto the end of TRIM5 to produce a new protein, the TRIM5 CYPA protein, which gives the carrier resistance to HIV.  And then there's your whole claim that mutations can't create new information but can destroy it.  Like, are you aware that most mutations are reversible?  If a gene changes a certain base from an A to a G and this causes the gene to become defunct, you would likely agree that this is a loss of information.  But mutations are reversible, meaning that it is now possible for the G to turn back into an A. If the change from A to G is a loss of information, then the change back from G to A must necessarily be an increase of information. ",
