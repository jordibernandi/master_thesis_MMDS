            "text": "Nietzsche is seen as one of the pioneers of nihilism, as well as a major contributor to the existentialist movement in philosophy during the 20th century.  First, we need to understand a little history.  Since the Great Roman Empire, Europe was predominantly a Christian continent.  Nearly all people followed the Judeo-Christian teachings of the creation of the universe, the creation of the human race, and of course, morality.  Right.  However, during the 19th century there was a huge cultural shift sweeping across Europe.  The development of the natural sciences and the works of Darwin cast doubt across the whole Judeo-Christian religion.  People were in fact losing their faith and losing their religion.  Nietzsche, picking up on this cultural shift, declared that God is dead.  He explained, God is dead, God remains dead, and we have killed him.  How shall we comfort ourselves, the murderers of all murderers?  Wow, very dark.  Yes, but this perfectly summed up the states Europe was in during the Enlightenment.  Imagine that for centuries people strongly believed in one God that created them.  They believed they were created for a reason, that the earth was the centre of the universe and they had been placed on this planet by an omnipotent being.  This gave all people a sense of purpose.  No matter how rich or poor, how strong or weak or how beautiful or ugly, we had all been created by the same God for a specific purpose and we are all governed by the same moral law and we are all judged the same way.  and no matter what, We are all equal in front of God and we are all either rewarded or punished in the afterlife.  Yes.  But as science developed and we understood more about human evolution, suddenly the stories in the Bible did not seem true.  Religion was declining and soon God was dead.  But with the death of God, it left a huge void in the lives of millions.  Suddenly, we were not important.  We were not the centre of the universe.  We no longer had a purpose.  Morality meant absolutely nothing.  There was no God to judge right and wrong and judge our lives.  There was no afterlife for reward or punishment.  No purpose, no reason, no creator and no morality.  Life was empty.  Life was meaningless.  This was the birth of nihilism.  Wow.  Now this is a lot to take on.  Morality is now pointless.  Values are meaningless.  Everything we have valued means nothing.  Truth, honesty, loyalty.  All these things no longer mean anything.  They are no longer virtues.  So where does Nietzsche go from here?  This video was just an extract.  The full video can be found here.  Thanks again and we look forward to seeing you all soon. ",
