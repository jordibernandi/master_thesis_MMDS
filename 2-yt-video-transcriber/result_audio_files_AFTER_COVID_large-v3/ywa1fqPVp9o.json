            "text": "So last week we had a preview of this Axios interview between Donald Trump and Jonathan Swan, which aired last night.  I reviewed the full interview and this is truly the stuff of legends.  I actually my vocabulary was not powerful enough.  to accurately describe the contents of this interview.  So I had to spend a bunch of time today reading Jack London in order to expand my vocabulary, to be better prepared to describe what it is that we are about to see.  That's a joke, by the way.  This may actually be the most damaging interview to Donald Trump that I have ever seen.  If you thought the Chris Wallace interview two weeks and two days ago on Fox News Sunday was bad and it was, This is arguably even worse.  And what's particularly spectacular about this interview is that Jonathan Swan calls out and confronts Donald Trump on all those things I've been saying during the last five months of coronavirus.  Somebody has to call him out.  Somebody has to confront him.  Well, Jonathan Swan did it.  When Trump lied about we have the lowest death rate, Jonathan Swan checked receipts and had Trump pulling out papers that Trump didn't even understand.  When Trump uses his bogus talking points or phrases like people are saying, Jonathan Swan says, who is saying, tell me exactly who is saying.  And Trump is never actually able to say, referring to vague books or whatever.  Let which Trump doesn't read.  Let's look at some of this and we'll talk through it.  Here's a series of hilarious fact checks and weird claims from Trump during the vote by mail portion of the interview.  And Trump tries to claim that absentee and mail in are two different things.  In this election, Swan says it's the same thing.  Trump says vote by mail is new.  Swan says it's been around since the Civil War.  This is really, really great stuff. ",

So now arguing we are doing the most testing, even if true, which it's not.  is no longer equally relevant because the game is to develop a testing program early.  There are many countries now that the U.S.  is passing in tests per capita over time because those countries don't have some people with symptoms.  They don't have people to test because they have so few cases early on.  Remember when we were 50th, 55th in testing per capita, that was the time to be testing to suppress the spread of the virus.  Many countries have done that.  So at this point, even bragging about our testing per capita rate becomes less relevant because even though it's still only 18th in the world, a lot of the countries we've passed since the countries that are 25th, 30th, 40th and testing per capita They don't have anybody to test anymore because they have so few cases.

This is equivalent to all lives matter.  Trump is asked about John Lewis's contributions to civil rights.  And Trump says lots of people contributed to civil rights.  That is, again, like, well, we're talking here about the victims of the Boston Marathon.  Well, but people also died in 9-11.  OK, but what?  Black Lives Matter.  Well, all lives matter.  OK, yeah, but we're talking about black lives right now.  What about John Lewis, who just passed away's contributions to civil rights?  Many people worked on civil rights.

I thought 16 days ago that the Fox News Chris Wallace interview was rock bottom as far as interviews are concerned.  No, this is far, far worse.  Let me know your thoughts.  I'm on Twitter at the Pacman.  And remember that you can get the daily audio podcast, excuse me, the daily audio podcast of the show every single day, right around 3 p.m.  Eastern time on whatever is your favorite podcasting app, Spotify, Google Play, Pandora, I Heart Radio, iTunes, whichever you prefer.  Get the daily audio podcast.  We'll take a quick break and be right back.  Real quick, I want to tell you about our sponsor, Magic Spoon, who have done something awesome.  They've taken all of our favorite sugary childhood cereals that we know we shouldn't eat anymore and turn them into something you can actually feel good about eating as an adult.  There's four flavors, cocoa, fruity, frosted and blueberry.  They taste great.  They're crunchy.  They're sweet, like you would expect this type of cereal to be.  But it's perfect for a ketogenic diet because one bowl has only three net carbs, 12 grams of protein.  It's sugar free, gluten free, grain free, soy free.  Once our team tried magic spoon for the first time, we actually ended up emailing magic spoon back and saying, can you send us more boxes, send more samples?  They've been a big hit.  with David Pakman show staffers and magic spoon knows how delicious their cereal is because if you don't like it, they'll refund all of your money.  No questions asked.  And you'll get free shipping.  when you go to magic spoon.com slash Pacman and use the code Pacman.  That's P a K M a N. ",
