            "text": "Vanderbilt kicker.  Sarah Fuller caught the nation's attention this week when she became the first woman to play in a Power 5 football game.  Fuller is actually a member of the women's soccer team at Vanderbilt.  However, the football team asked for her help because they had so many people out due to COVID-19 and needed a little assistance on their special teams.  So Fuller got the opportunity to play in Vanderbilt's game against Missouri and was able to give the second half kickoff.  This moment was celebrated far and wide by the media and by sports fans who claimed that Fuller was an inspiration for women everywhere, that she was a trailblazer breaking glass ceilings left and right.  She never would have been on the roster in the first place, of course, if it weren't for COVID-19.  And let's just say that her moment on the field was a little bit embarrassing.  Go ahead and watch her kick.  And the kick down at the 35 yard line and Sarah Fuller.  Happy Thanksgiving.  What a day.  What a day in college football.  Not only that, but as soon as Fuller kicked the ball, she immediately started running off the field, which when you're a kicker, you're supposed to stay and help out your defense.  In the case that the person returning the ball actually gets past some of your blockers, you have to try to make a tackle.  She didn't bother with any of that.  She was like, all right, I did my job.  I did my 30-yard squib kick.  Now I'm getting off the field.  She also apparently was allowed to give a halftime speech to her team despite the fact that she had only been a member of it for about a week.  I can only imagine how annoying that was for all of the people who have been part of the team for the whole season or for multiple years.  And her halftime speech doesn't sound very inspirational.  In fact, she basically just yelled at them for not cheering loudly enough.  After all this, a woman breaks the glass ceiling, gets to be on the football team, and she still just wants to be a cheerleader.  Here's what she said.  i was a little pissed off at how quiet everybody was on the sideline.  we made a first down and i was the only one cheering and i was like what the heck what's going on.  and i tried to get them pumped up and i was like you guys need to start your team on.  my main thing was during the sec tournament.  my entire team was cheering the entire time And then it keeps going, keeps going.  Oh God, she just rambles on and on.  Then she says, I just went in there and I said exactly what I was thinking.  I was like, we need to be cheering each other on.  This is how you win games.  This is how you get better is by calling each other out for stuff.  And I'm going to call you guys out.  So this girl that's been on the team for a week and was gearing up to do this incredible squib kick just to run off the field after she kicked it.  is yelling at these guys for not cheering loudly enough as they're getting destroyed, by the way, 21 to nothing.  I don't think cheering is how you win games.  Certainly motivation and pumping your teammates up is a good thing to do.  That's part of being a successful team.  But clearly when you're down 21 to nothing, the problem isn't that people aren't cheering loudly enough.  They ended up actually losing the game 41 to nothing, so I guess Fuller's inspirational second half kick didn't do enough to motivate her team to come back from its deficit.  But that didn't stop Fuller from being awarded the SEC Special Teams Co-Player of the Week.  As if this charade couldn't get any worse, they actually awarded her for being so bad at her job.  This is just an embarrassing display of tokenism all around.  Stuff like this does not help women.  And in fact, it actually sets us back because we have this woman who's supposed to be able to hang with the boys, go out there, do her job, keep her head down.  And instead it becomes this spectacle where she doesn't perform her job properly.  She lectures the rest and nags the rest of the team about how poor of a job that they're doing and then runs around with a media circus, patting herself on the back for how great of a job she did and how she's inspiring women everywhere.  uh this thing it god it's so embarrassing.  everyone who's treating this as this inspirational moment is is just lying to you.  i mean how can you be a college football coach and look at what just happened and say that's it that's the stuff that's what we want.  uh luckily i think I think, luckily, the Vanderbilt coach was actually fired after this game, if not only because of losing 41 to nothing, but hopefully for pulling this stunt as well.  Gosh, everything about it is so cringeworthy.  And I'm just glad that as a woman, I can make fun of it and not be accused of being a sexist because it was very, very bad. ",
