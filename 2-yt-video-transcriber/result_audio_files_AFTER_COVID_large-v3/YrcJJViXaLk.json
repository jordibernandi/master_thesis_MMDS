            "text": "Guys I found something.  Trump is finished.  Honestly, I don't... I really don't care about TikTok getting banned because of shit like this.  Like, it's just like... I hate to say it, but it's like all the worst people.  There's some good people on there too, but it's like literally all the worst people on TikTok doing all the worst shit.  She's the queen of Twitter libs?  Wait, is that for real?  Wait, I need to look into this more.  I need to look into this person more.  She's just like constantly retweeting Lincoln Project shit.  Please protect Angela at all costs.  If Bill Gates is buying TikTok from China, see if he could also buy back the Oval Office from Russia.  Look at her tweets and replies.  She's under every Trump tweet.  Friends, do we want more videos, more pictures like the pinned one or both?  Sunday thoughts.  There is no pain with COVID-45.  It's live and let die.  I want to ban everyone that's coming to this right now.  I'm not going to open it.  I don't know what the f*** is happening in there, dude.  This is like a meme of liberals and liberalism and, like, slacktivism and hashtags.  Hashtag activism turned into a real life, like, manifesting into a real life human being.  If you were in a lab and you were like, I want to create a human being that is, like, the most, like, meme-ified version of a liberal... This would be it.  I thought she could actually be doing a meme, but alas.  I need to see more of her videos now.  Republicans are lying about social security.  Wait, does she have more videos?  I need to see more videos.  It's so bad.  Sarah Cooper is a national treasure.  Who agrees?  At Sarah CPR, writer, comedian, blocked by Trump.  I wrote 100 tricks to appear smart in meetings.  How to be successful without hurting men's feelings.  2.1 million views. ",

            "text": "the actual funny thing is is trump.  i've seen some of this person's videos.  the actual funny thing is donald trump here.  it's just that like.  she's just lip syncing.  that's it.  this has 96 000 retweets.  this has 96 000 retweets.  dude what the dude?  this is the best one.  Why are we still here?  Just to suffer?  Every night.  This is so bad.  Why?  don't scroll down.  yeah usually they have like.  they usually post like like really really unhinged.  liberals love posting that like fake photo of trump's dick.  that's how you know.  that's how you know.  like someone is like a totally psychotic person like devil.  they have no awareness and they'll just straight up post like you know what i'm talking about.  the one where he like side profile and you can see like half of his head is like orange and the other half is like not orange.  let's see as orange rather and you can see he's like a little baby peepee.  it's not even real like.  it's just like a fake photo.  what's even more painful is that right-wingers think people like this and aoc bernie are on the same branch.  i just like wait liberate america from the trump dance.  wait why does she not post it with music like?  is she wait?  is this like a real five head?  is this like a real five head approach?  like?  is she making?  is she clowning on these liberals like?  i'm so confused?  is she like actually making fun of liberals?  because like some of them behave this way and like I don't know, is this performance art?  Like, she's portraying herself as, like, an unhinged lib?  Beautiful, is it not?  Oops, we couldn't find your video.  Thank f***ing God.  She doesn't like Bernie bros?  Yeah, no shit.  No shit she doesn't like Bernie bros.  This is the dance for those who can't handle outcomes that are saying rigged primary or Bernie bros.  United we win.  It's an interpretive dance designed to make Trump-tards shit themselves?  What?  Dude, this is so good.  I mean, this is... Okay, at first, I retaliated in disgust.  At first, I was confused.  Then I retaliated for a second in disgust.  But now I'm realizing that this is actually fucking hilarious.  It's hilarious because, like, people also appreciate this and, like, love it and retweet it because they think, like, oh, she slayed Queen, right?  Is that what it is?  Or are people... ironically retweeting her or something like this is this is what happens to out of work actors by the way like across the board.  uh i see this a lot.  i see this a lot here in los angeles.  like you try to be an actor it's.  it's a incredibly competitive field and only like 0.01 actually make it and those who can't make it oftentimes turn into this like they just like they turn into this shit whatever this is.  i don't know what the this is but they turn into this shit or they start.  you know they they get into like a multi-level marketing scheme or something like that.  you know what i mean.  Oh, this is so unhinged.  Oh, God, we fucking landed on a gold mine here, dude.  Boys, I don't think you understand.  Does Trump know that by banning TikTok, he's also pissing off suburban moms?  14,000 retweets?  Bro, why this lady barefoot in a fucking parking lot, dude?  What kind of caucasity is this?  Is this like a new thing where you like, is this a weird way to flex how expensive your neighborhood is or something?  Because if you are ever in any normal parking lot without your shoes, you're getting hep C from the ground.  by touching the ground.  I don't understand it.  The only thing she's resisting is the urge to wear a shoe like a normal person.  Here's a reply to the very first one.  I'll be voting for Joe Biden.  Who's with me?  He's going to win the 2020 election big.  I mean, these guys are like half grifter.  half like have significant problems with their brain like they just have bad brains.  okay i'm trying to not be ableist while simultaneously giving you other keywords but like it is kind of ableist what i'm saying.  but they just have bad brains like you can't do anything about it.  it's a it's straight up brain disease.  they just have the bad kind of brain and not the good kind of brain and that's just it.  and and they're like grifting to other people with exactly the same kind of brad brain that they have 51,000 retweets, dude.  What?  You're being very rude saying mean things about a subscriber?  yeah there is zero percent chance that either of these people have subscribed to me at any given moment because they would know more.  uh they would know better than to to do anything like this.  the only reason why a subscriber of mine would do some like this is to be ironic and like make fun of people like this.  don't be mean to her.  my dad thinks she's funny.  i mean at least your dad like.  honestly if your dad thinks she's funny then that's good.  that means that he's.  the only conspiracies that he believes in are russiagate conspiracies which are nowhere near as damaging as like coronavirus is a 5g fake conspiracy and like bill gates is trying to.  you know bill gates is trying to inject uh demon semen into our brains or something like whatever the right-wing dads believe.  so it's nowhere near as bad.  these people are just lost.  dude they're lost.  okay they just trump has broken their brains.  they don't have good brains anymore.  part of the reason why i don't have good brains is because trump has ruined comedy because there's no way to be funnier than trump.  you just can't do it.  the point i'm trying to make is that like trump has ruined comedy altogether.  before that the obama administration era liberals were also doing their very best to ruin it.  trump was just the straw that broke the camel's back in its entirety.
