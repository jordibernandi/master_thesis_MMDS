Just like Danny said, you know, people started using this term, essential worker, this past year, but you have always been essential workers.  That's right!  Everybody got to eat every day, every day.  And so just like the hospital is essential to us, our food distribution is essential to us.  It's the core, it's the base of our economy.  We need nurses.  We need people loading trucks.  We need everybody and we need you.  And we gotta pay you like we need you.  Because we do.  You are not replaceable.  You are not expendable.  You are valuable.  And you are valued.  And we love you.  And just like Danny said, that's the solidarity of our actions that are going to get us through.  It is sticking together.  You know, a lot of people... ",

And I thought about one of the last things, the last speech that Martin Luther King gave to the mountaintop, to the mountaintop.  And what was he doing on that day?  What was he doing? ",

And I think about one of the last remarks that Martin Luther King gave, and it was a speech called To the Mountaintop.  Now, we know about the struggle for civil rights, but one of the things that we're talking about is how often King's legacy... get to whitewash and look through with rose-colored glasses.  Because what was King doing on that last day in that last speech?  He was standing up, just like Jumaane said, standing up with sanitation workers and the union for sanitation workers demanding better working conditions, demanding an end to poverty.  demanding an end to war, demanding a better material and just outcome for all people in the United States.  This right here is why I do what I do.  This is why I do what I do.  This is why I'm out here.  You know, too, that you're not just standing up for that baby.  You're standing up for babies all across this country.  Because just like there are workers here, there are workers, food workers in every pocket of the United States who deserve more than a dollar.  who deserve more than a raise.  They deserve health care.  They deserve justice.  They deserve good working worker rights.  And that's what we're here to fight for today.  So I want you all to know that when you're standing on this line, you're not just asking for a dollar. ",

            "text": "You are asking for transformational change for your lives and for the lives of every food worker across this country, for kids of food workers across this country.  Because there's a lot of things upside down right now in our economy.  And one of those things that's upside down is the fact that a person who is helping get the food to your table cannot feed their own kids.  That's upside down.  The fact that someone who can help you get care or help deliver your groceries can't even get health care themselves.  or can't even get access to those things themselves.  That's not right.  That's upside down.  And so what we're doing here today is taking the upside down and making the right side up.  And the only way we do that, we don't do that with just like a politician like myself.  We do that with people and collective struggle together.  Together.  So I come here to just be here shoulder to shoulder with each of you all.  And for all of our workers here, for all of our other unions that are operating in solidarity coming out here, thank you for showing up.  And for anybody who might be watching or hearing, who isn't part of the youth, who's just in the neighborhood, pull up!  Pull up!  Make more workers!  Bring some hot chocolate!  I brought some, we got some, we got some Bustano on deck, it's coming!  But we're gonna bring more and more and more, and the more we talk about this, the more everybody can put on the pressure so that we not just get a buck, but that we change lives for people across this country.

And the only way that we do that is if we make sure and continue to make sure that New York City is a Teamster town.  And that's what this city is.  This city is a teamster town.  New York City is a union town.  And that's how we make sure that working people can have a just, dignified life.  Because just like we were talking about with King, one of the things that King said is that all labor has dignity.  All labor has dignity.  And the thing that gives labor dignity is good wages.  Solid benefits, labor rights, protection, protection from discrimination.  All labor has dignity.  And so when I just rolled up, you know, on my way over here, I heard that music bumping, I saw the fires going, and that community means something.  Because that community is solidarity, and solidarity gets us labor rights, it gets us wages, it gets us improved conditions, and it gets us a better city.  And so when we are a Teamster town, when we are a union town, we are a dignified town.  We're a town that feeds its families, every family, that honors all labor.  And those hugs, you know, they make us feel good because it's that.  Those hugs feel good because it's solidarity, too.  This whole city is behind you.  There is no working person in New York City that I can hear of or even think of.  that would think that what you're doing is wrong.  Everybody's behind you.  everybody's behind you and remember that.  remember that everyone's behind you.  so let's celebrate that community.  let's celebrate that solidarity.  we'll go bring out the hot chocolate for you guys.  let's enjoy each other's company and let's make sure that we hold the line nice and strong until we get that dollar.  so thank you all very much.
