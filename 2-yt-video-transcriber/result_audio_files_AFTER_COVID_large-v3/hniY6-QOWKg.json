As you may have figured out by now, the way you sound to yourself is not how you sound to other people.  You might have tried to circumvent this by recording your voice.  Well, that is also not really what you sound like to other people.  When you're actually in a real space talking to other individuals, so much of the voice that they actually hear from you is created by the room, okay?  So when you talk, your voice bounces around the room hundreds of times, which creates what we call reverberation, okay?  Now, You need to be able to have reverb in your voice in order for you to truly understand what you sound like to other people.  Now, The easiest way to do this is like so.  You take the hands like this.  The ear is gonna fit behind it.  This presses up against your jaw and cheekbone, which dampens the vibration.  The back of the hand is amplifying the late reflections off the back wall in your room, and it's blocking the early reflections.  So you end up with a much more Realistic model of what your voice actually sounds like to other people in the space with you.  This is a much better way to hear your voice than recording or just listening to yourself back while you talk.  So overall you're gonna do this.  Okay, you do that on both sides heat from fire And then you can practice like that.  Oh my God.  It sounds so, so, so cool.  So this is like a modified approach.  I first learned this with folders in a psychology class and the folders work, but they are not near as ideal as using your hands because they don't produce enough mass and they're not soft enough and squishy enough to really dampen the vibrations that come from this place.  So yes, seriously, try this right now and tell me what you think about your voice in the comments below, okay?  I swear, I have seen this be such an effective tool for so many people to hear their voice better and to feel more confident in their practice routines, okay?  If you have any questions or comments or anything, please post below.  I hope this is incredibly helpful for you.  Please do not underestimate how powerful this can be for your own psychology to feel more confident and powerful and free in the process of voice feminization.  So yes, if you have any questions or comments, please post below.  Thank you so much for the support.  Check me out on Patreon.  Like and subscribe.  And until next time, love ya.  Bye.  Cheers. ",
