            "text": "General Flynn, Alex Jones here.  General Flynn, your little buddy.  How you doing, buddy?  Crazy day, huh?  It is crazy.  I'm scared.  We're going to win.  What?  You want me to be scared?  You want me to take my hand?  No.  Let's go ahead and analyze the awkward exchange between General Flynn and the radio shock jock Alex Johnstein.  Alex performs a half-ass bum rush on the general with a bullhorn in hand.  So many things Alex could never understand because he never had to go through basic military training where you are brainwashed to treat generals like gods.  So generals go through life.  They go at least through half of their life being treated like gods.  I mean, they really put up on a pedestal.  They have their own jets.  I mean, seriously, they pretty much do whatever they want.  You cannot imagine their egos.  The arrogance of having those stars on your shoulders is blinding.  A general thinks he can do anything, even if it's illegal.  He could never respect anybody who did not serve or wore the uniform.  A general will use civilians, you know, like the civilian hacker kids.  The general will use them, but the general will never respect them.  A general will use civilian media punks, but the general will never respect them.  This is just all modern-day Machiavelli bullshit.  But anyhow, let's take one more look at the shock jock.  He's like a bull in a china shop here.  He's just running through there.  He's got his bullhorn.  General Flynn, your little tiny friend.  Look at him just charging through there.  I mean, did you see that guy with the white hat on?  He's an ex-military old veteran guy.  He kind of slowed down.  He tried to block Alex, but basically he was slowing him down just looking for weapons and stuff.  He's, you know, he's just eyeing him out, making sure he's a, you know, he's a friendly.  You know, Alex Jones is a friendly, but he's just, I mean, just got no cooth.  He's a, He doesn't understand the protocols.  The problem with self-made men like Alex Jonestine is their ego.  Their ego prevents them from having personal advisors.  You know, people right there on the scene at all times kind of advising you.  Since Alex has no military training, he would not be aware of the protocols on how to bum-rush.  You know, the bum-rushing protocol.  prima donna generals with bull horns and bullshit.  I mean, there's just, you know, there's a certain protocol to how you do that.  One more thing we must analyze when we're dealing with people like General Flynn.  You see, again, Alex Johnstein has been in the radio business most of his life.  And the culture of the radio business is much, much different than the culture of government.  See, the culture of government is you can be friends one day, and the next day everybody in government just forgets about you, especially in the military.  One day you can have your best buddy in the military, but if you get on the shit list, all of a sudden nobody wants to talk to you.  All these lifers, they want to be able to get through their 20 years.  I want to get out with my 20 years of my pension.  They won't sacrifice anything for friendship.  So there really are no real friendships in government.  It's just all Machiavelli dealings here.  You're dealing with peoples.  almost like uh an opponent.  it's like a war.  even you're.  you're dealing with people in the government that they they act like you're your friend but behind your back they can stab you in the back and then the generals really really think they're god way at the top.  and there's so much machiavellian going on here.  and and the problem with alex jonestine is you don't learn that in the radio business.  you know if you're a radio Shock jock.  You know, you are sometimes put up on a pedestal, and maybe you treat the little guys badly.  And I guess that's where this story is going to lead us to, you know, how does Alex Jonestine treat people?  He kind of treats people like generals treat people.  Yeah, the David Knight story coming right up.  Alex Jones fired David Knight.  Anyhow, but let's close this out here with the General Flynn, analyzing the General Flynn awkward exchange.  Basically, the shock jock, steroid driven radio personality, Alex Jonestein, He thought he was buddy-buddy with a military general, okay?  A general that can send a private to his death.  Think again.  The general will use you, okay?  He will expect you to show him respect.  He will demand you show him respect.  But you're not his friend.  No, you're not his friend at all.  And you better play by the protocols or he'll give you the cold shoulder.  I mean, it's really as simple as that.  all right onward to the uh firing of david knight.  it looks like there's trouble at alex jonestein info wars empire.  he fired david knight and there's a massive purge underway.  as we speak a knight let's let's right here.  david knight says i was just fired by alex alex effective immediately.  this happened on december 17th.  now Most people, everybody likes David Knight.  He's a nice, soft-spoken, polite, professional gentleman.  I mean, I do.  Everybody likes David Knight.  And he's finally come clean and is recognizing that Donald Trump is a fraud.  I mean, Donald Trump is a TV reality actor playing a revolutionary dictator.  But his ratings have cratered since losing in November.  And David Knight said this.  I'll repeat.  This is what David Knight just quoted.  We have been straining at gnats with the Democrats, and then we swallow a camel when it comes to Trump.  What he's trying to say is Trump does all this bad shit.  Nobody calls Trump out on it, especially Alex Jonestine.  Alex Jonestine basically is a puppet or, you know, working with Donald Trump.  They don't talk about Donald Trump promoting vaccines.  And I predicted... About three years ago, when Alex Jonestine jumped on a Trump train and he just was all gun-ho, I predicted that Alex Jonestine would go down with Trump, okay?  Because, you know, Trump is promoting vaccine.  Look at this lady.  The lady passed out taking a vaccine.  How can a guy be a patriot?  How can you be a real patriot and you promote these vaccines?  Well, anyhow, apparently this was too much for David Knight to swallow.  So Alex Johnstein fired him.  I mean, you cannot say anything bad about Donald Trump.  You cannot question Donald Trump.  Donald Trump has put up on a pedestal with Alex Johnstein.  And basically, we know that Donald Trump and Alex Johnstein, they're both owned by the same group of people.  I hope I don't have to tell you who this is.  So Donald Trump and Alex, they will go down together.  So even General Flynn has snubbed Jonestine at the Trump missionary revival.  That's what Donald Trump going forward, that's what they're going to be.  He's going to try to make money doing these town missionary revivals.  It should be fun to watch.  Grab your popcorn. ",
