            "text": "I asked Congressman Mark Pocan if Kamala Harris can take over the Senate.  An interesting conversation.  Check it out, leave your comments, ding the bell, share it with your friends, and subscribe to our channel.  Congressman Mark Pocan, co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus representing the 2nd District of Wisconsin, taking your calls for the hour.  And Congressman, if I may take a moment of host's privilege here and ask you a question on behalf of myself.  that's a little complex.  I got into this quite a bit on the air yesterday, and then I spent the entire afternoon and half the evening last night reading the rules of the Senate, printing out hundreds of pages, reading the rules of the Senate, reading James Madison's notes from the debates in the Constitutional Convention, excuse me, and also reading the history of individual vice presidents, starting with John Adams.  And here's what I found.  The Constitution says that, and I quote, this is Article 1, Section 2, Clause 5A, the Senate shall choose their other officers and also a president pro tempore, in other words, a sitting president, a temporary acting president.  In the absence of the vice president, or when he shall exercise the office of president of the United States.  So in other words, and you go back to the original debates, and the assumption was that the vice president would have principally a legislative job while being the president and waiting.  They would be the person who runs the Senate.  You go to the Senate rules, and the question I'm getting to, and I'll just hit it right off, you go to the Senate, is it possible that Kamala Harris, as Vice President, can simply walk in and say, Mitch, you're not in charge anymore.  I am the President of the Senate, according to the United States Constitution.  And I'm going to take that role.  The rules of the Senate start out, in the absence of the vice president, the Senate shall choose a president pro tem who shall hold the office and execute the duties thereof during the pleasure of the Senate and until another is elected or his term of office as senator expires.  And then the second rule, number two, this is appointment of a senator to chair.  In the absence of the vice president and pending the election of a president pro tem, the acting president pro tem or the secretary of state shall perform the duties of the chair.  And it goes through this whole long list.  And every single one of them is in the absence of the vice president.  John Adams actually presided over the Senate.  Thomas Jefferson, when he became vice president in the Adams administration, basically hated John Adams, was a different political party, didn't want to have anything to do with anything political, and he spent most of his time as vice president writing.  what are now the rules for the Senate and the House, which include the stuff I just read to you.  uh... after jefferson's presidency vice president started presiding over the senate again and continue to write up until around eighteen ninety when they vice president just said okay that's it you know.  and there were times when they didn't didn't you know?  and sometimes there was conflict around.  sometimes there wasn't to the best your knowledge.  is anybody raised this?  and uh... i realize you have access to the house parliamentarian.  i don't know if you do the senate parliamentarian.
