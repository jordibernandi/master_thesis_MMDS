            "text": "Lie can go around the world three times before the truth can get his shoes on.  Bad news spreads faster than anything that we've ever seen.  By the time the truth come out, we've all bought into the lie.  So it's hard for us to hear the truth.  That's one of the main things that I've taught you here about even scripture, about finances, about the structure of racism.  But if it's one thing that I taught y'all about before the quarantine happened, It was the control of government and the use of fear to do it.  The foundation of every government's power is fear.  They don't change the book.  So y'all, I told y'all this is a chess game you are witnessing.  You are witnessing a chess game between the black race and the white race and all their little friends that go along with them.  We're playing chess.  So y'all can't start fucking up the game.  Stay in the game.  Then y'all see what they doing.  Every time we make a move, they're making a counter move.  And y'all don't realize how big this is.  Don't y'all get it?  Don't nobody want to see us like this right now.  Don't nobody want to see us united right now.  Don't nobody want to see bros pulling out guns and defending their own right now.  Don't.  nobody want to see you starting to stand up and act like a damn human being.  Y'all really can't get over that.  Y'all got to get that through your head.  Wake up.  I hate to say it to you like that, but it's the truth.  And they're doing a chess game right in front of you.  So I had to come and say what I got to say.  But let me, before I do that, I want to cover something.  See, you have to understand something that everybody... Everybody experiences fear.  Every animal experiences fear.  Human beings, perhaps most of all.  Any animal incapable of fear would have been hard-pressed to survive, regardless of its size, its speed, or any attributes that it has.  Fear is what alerts us to dangers that threaten our well-being and sometimes our very life.  So when you sense fear, we respond by running away, by hiding, or by preparing the ward off the danger.  That's what fear does.  When you're afraid, you want to run away.  That's what's supposed to make scary movies.  so scary, is the fact that when something scary happens, you're ready to run away.  Oh, get away.  Ah, they're running, falling all over their damn self.  The monster's steady coming, cooler than a motherfucker.  And you, oh, God, what are we going to do?  Scared.  Listen, listen.  Okay, let me get in everybody's head for a second.  So y'all gonna see where I'm about to go with this.  Because this shit is funny to me.  Because I've been in combat.  I know how they play with your head.  The first thing you do to the enemy is you scare them.  You scare them.  You just put some bullshit out.  There ain't no proof to what you said, but just put it out.  Let two, three motherfuckers say it.  And before you know it, everybody's saying it.  And then everybody, don't nobody know where the proof at.  There's no proof.  But y'all scared.  So everybody, oh, we already done won the war already.  And it's the same trick they play on you time and time again.  And if another one of y'all send me that goddamn video with this idiot standing up there talking about the incredible threat.  Really, do you know who that is?  Have you questioned the source of the information?  The Huey Newton Gun Club?  What are you, stupid?  Now, I know y'all probably don't realize, well, who would have been behind such a story?  Oh, well, let me help y'all out.  I keep telling y'all this is chess moves, not checkers.  The United States government came out with an announcement and I quote, domestic terrorists could target July 4th holiday events, but no known plots, say the feds.  When have y'all started believing the government?  Y'all gotta make up your mind.  Are y'all trying to get free?  Are you just trying to be comfortable in your captivity?  Y'all sending me mixed up signals.  Listen to what they say.  I'm going to tell you what they say.  Listen to this.  It said federal authorities are warning that white supremacists and other political radicals.  Pay attention.  Pay attention to the terminology.  And other political radicals could look to attack independence day revelers on July 4th.  Notice the word revelers.  That means people who are celebrating the 4th.  Not motherfuckers like us who are not celebrating the 4th.  They say that they will be attacking people celebrating the 4th.  Revelers!  Notice how they're trying to put them in a positive light.  So anybody who do anything to anybody who's celebrating the 4th, you are obviously who they talking about.  Noting in a bulletin to law enforcement around the country that domestic terrorists have attacked perceived oppressors, opponents, or enemies engaged in outdoor First Amendment protected rallies or protests during past summers.  So they trying to say, based on some shit that happened last year, that they be saying, yo, y'all be cool.  The white supremacist is going to attack motherfuckers and some other people, but we ain't got no proof.  But yo, I'm about to teach you all, black world, how you respond.  Y'all not responding correctly.  If you was on the playground and somebody did not like you, then they would make it known that they did not like you.  Then somebody would come over to you and say, y'all remember this shit?  So and so and so said he gonna beat you.  And you'd be like, I ain't trying to hear that.  You go back and tell him I said such and such and such and such.  It was threat, counter threat, threat, counter threat.  That's how politics work.  We threaten them, they threaten us back.  We threaten them with this, they say, y'all do this, we gonna do that.  Black nation, don't you know when you're being threatened?  So stop bringing me the threats.  Respond back.  Yo, so y'all gonna start shooting black folks at 8 p.m.  when we'll start shooting white folks at 8.05.  That's a threat counter threat.  And then they're telling you they have no proof of anything.  Listen to what they're going to say.  This is coming from your government.  The warning came in a joint intelligence bulletin issued by the FBI, Department of Homeland Security, and the National Counterterrorism Center urging law enforcement personnel to remain vigilant for suspicious activity.  Ain't that they damn job anyway?  Such bulletins are routinely distributed in the days before a major national holiday, but previous bulletins have often focused on homegrown terrorists inspired by overseas groups like ISIS or Al Qaeda, rather than domestic terrorists radicalized by domestic issues such as abortion or white supremacy.  So if you're against abortion or if you're against white supremacy, all of a sudden you're domestic terrorism.  I keep telling y'all they're looking for a reason to label every one of these organizations domestic terrorism.  And they're setting your ass up for it because they're threatening you and they're going to make you act up.  No, they're not.  Y'all stop falling for these fear tactics.  Your government is running a number on you.  They don't want us to have the black guns.  Don't y'all understand the significance of us doing this shit?  Now they want to scare y'all to stay home because some unknown white folks might attack.  Well, guess what?  Some unknown black folks might attack too.  This shit goes both ways.  Now either y'all tired of this shit or y'all ain't.  This ain't the time to be holy.  This is the time to be a warrior.  And if you're not, you step the fuck out the way.  And stop being all spooky and shit and sending us these emails talking about, ooh, this is going to be a threat.  Okay, tell them.  First of all, who told you?  Take me to the person who told you.  He told you?  Who told you to tell him?  I want to know where the threat came from.  Because it doesn't end up in an FBI bulletin out the blue.  And you basing this on, and then y'all spooky asses running around repeating that shit.  We out here standing on the verge of doing one of the most historical things that the black community has done, and I don't know how long, and half you bourgeois niggas ain't even with it.  Y'all blowing my goddamn mind, bruh.  Y'all talking about y'all want this, y'all want that, but y'all don't act like y'all want it.  Y'all gonna let them scare you?  OK, let me let me give you all a common sense question.  This is for everybody who got a little bit of sense.  I don't need everybody.  A lot of y'all just fall back.  It's going to be cool.  Let me see if I can do it like this.  Y'all ain't going to get it unless I. OK, so you got you got.  I'm going to be generous.  You got a thousand brothers and sisters.  out there, like this, a thousand, not five, not 10, not 25, a thousand brothers and sisters at a minimum out there, who've had it up to here, knowing that you motherfuckers already said you was gonna try to kill somebody, right?  So we out there.  Like we just came out that motherfucker, right?  Mm-hmm, okay.  Would you attack us?  You know what?  So, since we in the business of making threats, Since the white race appears to have spoken, I think that this is one of the purposes that I would have to serve to put y'all on notice.  That please understand that should you attack any group, African American, for the sole purpose of them being black, expect an equally as devastating retaliation against your community too.  It won't start none, it won't be none, but whatever you do to us, we're gonna do to you.  Now take that for what it's worth.  Y'all want to pass threats around and stop trying to scare us out of exercising our constitutional rights.  What makes you think we go stand in and let somebody come in a? ",
