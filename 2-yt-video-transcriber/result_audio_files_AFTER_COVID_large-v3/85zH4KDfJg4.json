            "text": "Are there bookshops in Nigeria?  You know, I think... I think it reflects very poorly on French people that you have to ask me that question.  I really do.  Because, I mean... I think in general that France... doesn't seem to realize that it is no longer an 18th century world power.  And I say this with sad honesty because I have affection for, oh, the minister left.  Oh, okay, good.  But I mean, I think that French, so I'm Anglophone African, I'm not Francophone.  But I think that French, the history of French and Francophone relations, I find very vexed and troubling.  I think it's interesting, this idea that the CFA, the Francophone currency, is somehow tied to the French Franc.  I find that really retrograde.  I think that the way that there's a kind of cultural power that France wields over Francophone Africa that I think is unhealthy.  I think Francophone films are really French films in a way that that's not the case in Anglophone West Africa.  There is a kind of, I think the way that Anglophone Africans occupy their space in the UK is not the same way that Francophone Africans occupy their space in France.  And I think that Francophone Africans who know this, and maybe they should be the ones answering this question, because I know I read a bit about it, but obviously I don't have a personal experience.  But I should say that my criticism when I started out, and I stand by it, it's because I've had many unpleasant experiences with French immigration.  Yesterday was different because they were actually polite, but every time I have come into France, and it's happened I mean to say four or five times in the past two years, there is a kind of contempt with which I am dealt with when I present my Nigerian passport that I really find indefensible.  And I think it's important because the immigration officers are the first lines of contact with the country and so it shapes the way you think of a country.  And I think it takes very little to be polite and to give people their basic dignity.  And if I'm coming into a country and I have everything I need and I am legally there, then surely there's no reason to keep me for 30 minutes asking me ridiculous questions, ignoring me for long periods, and just being an ass.  So that's what has shaped my irritation with, yeah, I think it's important to remember that all human beings really deserve equal dignity.  It shouldn't depend on the passport that we carry. ",
