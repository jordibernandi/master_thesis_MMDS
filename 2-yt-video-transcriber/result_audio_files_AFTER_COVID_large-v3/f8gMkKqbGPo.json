            "text": "hey fam welcome back again to my channel.  thank you all so much for coming back thank you.  uh if you're coming by my channel for the first time you're welcome as well.  virtue grace here.  have you subscribed?  i guess no.  why go ahead and subscribe?  thank you.  thank you so much for subscribing.  guys welcome back.  I appreciate every one of you.  you know that already.  so today I'm here to share with you another interesting story.  I know this story just gets me very excited and happy because I feel like we are beginning to take steps and working and will continue to work if we keep doing it.  so i'm talking about cross river state.  now remember i brought you a previous story about cross river states in which the state owned and i'm emphasizing state owned because a lot of people were asking me questions that are you sure?  the um the garment factory we're talking about is is owned by nigerians and not chinese.  so no it's not owned by chinese it's a state-owned garment factory.  In that story, I told you that that state-owned garment factory is mass-producing face masks and distributing to residents of cross-river states, people we call cross-riverians, free of charge, okay?  And the interesting thing is... Cross River State has not recorded a single case of COVID-19, guys.  No single case.  So the government is taking proactive steps, you know, to as much as possible prevent any incident of the virus, you know, in the state.  So the government, in addition to mass producing and distributing these face masks free of charge, The state government has issued an order that no face masks, no public outings.  So for you to leave your house and go to any public place, you must have your face mask on.  Else, stay at home.  But the state is not locked down.  People are still going about business as usual, going to work, doing everything and just living a good life.  Times like this, I wish I was still living in Cross River State because remember I said I had lived there for two years.  Beautiful place, very coordinated and just a lovely place to be.  If you're planning to visit Nigeria, I recommend Cross River State for you.  You'll have a good time.  a good time is assured trust me and at this time i wish i was still living there.  guys all i care we've been locked in for one full month now.  this is the fourth week of the four weeks of lockdown so that's one full month right?  Anyway, that's by the side.  Now, back to the main story.  Cross River State has done all of this.  And in addition, they have set up a task force to ensure that everybody going out to the public has a face mask on.  I know people argue that, well, face masks can't protect you from infection and all.  But health experts say... if you feel unwell or you have any symptoms of covid or any of those flu symptoms it's better for you to wear a face mask in order to prevent the spread to the next person.  and since we don't know who has any of those symptoms it's better that everybody puts on the face mask right.  so i guess that's the rationale behind the order of no face mask no public outing okay.  so back to the crux of this video.  what has the governor done this time around?  The state government has launched a food bank, a very massive food bank.  In fact, take a look.  This is what they do. ",

            "text": "This one, not only for young men and women.  This one is for people who went, not going to field work again.  People went there for house.  They don't get paid when they take care of them.  Either you are vulnerable, or you are old, tired, and sick without a loved one.  But the real thing now, Tuesday, On Tuesday, any young man and woman will not get job.  Will be 18 years to the age of 35.  Automatic job.  When I don't hear anything, they call me job cannibal.  We get job cannibal on Tuesday.  We don't announce that for radio.  because it goes better.  make everybody one hundred thirty thirty thousand making collect every month.  they're not gonna give you every day when we find you something where it will hold you.  take care of you.  make you know enter streets put your name so we will call you.  we will know whether you want to be a gardener you want to be cleaner you want to be a nurse.  any job when you choose say you won't do.  we go down but not thirty thousand.  But if your situation is bad, I will come collect these 30,000 NRI moons.  Let them survive.  So 8,000 people will be employed on Tuesday.  One day, 8,000 people.  Today, the chairman of Traditional Rural Arts Council, they will receive the food.  where they will give to all the traditional rulers across the 18 local governments.  We still have two big warehouses like this, one in Ogoja and one in Ikom, distributing to the sanitarial district.  We don't call politicians and make it distributo because our traditional rulers will not say what they do.  and then they do and what are PDP or APC.  We, we don't know party, we'll be government. ",

Nobody can collect two types of hands.  They go driving.  They will call this one.  This one, they go to this church.  Because every church, must produce in one person.  Every mosque must bring somebody in to collect their own goods.  This warehouse, they play till now one and they see so.  When we give out finish, we begin give job.  So, food plus job.  I don't try my best. ",

            "text": "So these food items are going to be distributed to vulnerable members of their communities because, yes, there's no lockdown in the state, but these are just proactive steps that the government is taking.  in the event of any need for the state to be locked down, you know, should they record any case.  And apart from that, a lot of people have been calling for, you know, an afrocentric response to this pandemic because like i said in my previous video one size does not fit all.  what works in europe might not necessarily work in africa because we have our unique problems.  so it's important that our governments and duty bearers you know take our local problems into cognizance and develop you know um Local solutions that will solve this problem.  So if you're asking people to stay at home, the least you can do is to make it easier for people to stay at home.  And some of the, you know, actions I feel are centric and might work if the government, you know, implement one by providing food relief to people.  People are daily wage earners.  Some who are monthly, you know, salary earners are staying at home now.  So if the government can just, you know, provide some food relief to people, it will be easier for people to stay at home, you know.  Another thing that might work is if water is provided, a lot of people have to go out to go and fetch water or buy water and in the process end up congregating in, you know, some sizable numbers all over the place.  So if government does this thing, provides water, provides food relief, it will reduce those chances of people going out, you know, often to congregate in search of water or food.  Another thing that might work, electricity.  But we might argue that and say, well, electricity, you know, is an infrastructure that might take a lot to provide in the wake of this emergency.  So I won't really, you know, emphasize that.  But just food and water, these are basic.  If government would just make these available, It would be easier for people to stay at home.  You've also heard the governor offer jobs to people.  The fact that he has said anybody who is jobless and needs a job, just come meet him, like he has said, and you'll be offered a job.  So one thing I know about Governor Ayode is the fact that he backs his words with actions.  Just the way he has said it, he's going to do it.  Having lived in Cross River State for two years, I can say that for sure.  I know, at least that I know about him.  When we share these stories, we just wish and expect that more governments and more government officials will take cues like these and then replicate similar actions or, you know, be nudged to take actions that will work for their... you know, specific communities and their specific challenges.  Because no action is too little.  A little here and there will go a long way.  You never know what change that little action might cause in the life of an individual, a family or a community.  Anyway, when all is said and done, all we wish for earnestly is for this pandemic to be over so that life can go back to normal and we can just go back to living our normal lives earning our wages and you know just having a good time and living our lives.  i mean nobody wants to be a dependent and also that's our earnest prayer.  we just hope that as we play our parts to cooperate with our government the curve can be flattened early on enough and you know, our systems and our lives to return back to normal.  Thank you so much, guys, for watching this video.  What do you think?  Do you think this is the step in the right direction that the governor and government of Cross River State has taken?  What do you think?  Drop a comment as usual, guys.  Let's interact in the comment section.  I love doing it with you guys.  Thank you so much for watching this video.  Share it like I always say.  Share it.  It's a good news, right?  Let people hear about it.  Thank you so much for watching.  I'll see you in my next video.  Bye. ",
