I mean, your entire show, your entire network now is just how much you hate Trump.  And I get that your show wants to attack Texas and Florida and Georgia because they have Republican governors.  We have also had much, much lower death rates than many other parts of the country.  And it's political, the attacks you're making.  There is something disgusting that Democrats are doing, that Joe Biden does, and that you do, which is you try to blame the people who've lost their lives on your political enemies.  And that's just not right.  It's not right at all. ",
