A journalist, political analyst, TV personality, and author, Caleb is a 21st century socialist and advocate of international friendship and cooperation.  He first rose to prominence through socialist organizing in Cleveland, Ohio.  In 2010, Caleb attended a student walkout protesting teacher layoffs and filmed an instance of police brutality against two African American high school students.

Facts, dates, obscure legislation, the fates of forgotten labor leaders, snippets of protest songs.  In part, he's learned the game as a careful student of history, but he also sees himself as an inheritor of the radical tradition.  In 2011, when the Occupy Wall Street movement took root in New York City, Caleb was at the center of the action.  At the first General Assembly, he gave a fiery speech built around the phrase and idea of class against class.

After Occupy, Caleb decided it was time to get a haircut and start traveling.  Soon he was speaking at important conferences in Iran, Ecuador, Venezuela, Brazil, and Russia.  In 2013, he led the Hands Off Syria protests, demanding the end of American efforts to overthrow the Syrian government.  Appearing on CNN, Caleb urged President Obama himself not to launch a new war.  In 2015, Caleb was invited to join with the Red Crescent Society of Iran.  delivering medical supplies to war-torn Yemen.  The rescue ship created an international incident, and Saudi Arabia bombed the port of Hodeidah eight times in a single day to keep Caleb and the small group of medical volunteers from arriving.  Since that time, Caleb's writing has been translated into a number of languages.  He's been featured and quoted on China.org, Forbes, The Nation, Democracy  Now!,  and many other outlets.  he works as a reporter for the international television network rt and his work is viewed by millions every day.  caleb never turns down an opportunity to debate favor of socialism whether against liberals conservatives fascists or anarchists.  caleb maupin is a marxist anti-racist and feminist.  he opposes all forms of oppression but he's also a christian and a patriotic american.
