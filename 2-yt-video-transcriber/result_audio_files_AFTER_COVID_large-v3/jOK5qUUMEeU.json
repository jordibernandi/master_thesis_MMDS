            "text": "Shalom family, welcome to a morning commentary with Tale Ministries.  Title of this commentary is Judgment on Right-Wing Evangelicals.  According to many right-wing evangelicals, they believe that America was a Christian nation.  They believe that America is no longer a Christian nation.  But America was never a Christian nation.  America was founded by Freemasons and we can see that by the structures all throughout Washington, D.C.  We know many of the leaders of America were Freemasons.  Many of the people that they captured from Africa and brought to the Americas were Israelites.  They call us African Americans.  They called us Negroes.  Now America is under judgment.  Till ministries have warned.  Many of the quote unquote Americans that this would occur.  They had a short window to repent, but they would not as the scripture says.  And now they're concerned because they see civil war on the horizon.  They see martial law on the horizon.  They see judgment on the horizon.  The thing they do not know is that although they call on the most high, the most high is judging America.  Now, many of them will say, well, America is under judgment because of abortion.  I'm sure that's one of many reasons.  Many say that America is under judgment because they have turned away from God.  My question to you is, was America really turn towards god.  america has always kill steal and destroy.  this is america's history.  when americans arrived quote unquote americans europeans who became americans.  they killed the native american indians when they took over this land.  they also brought people over here to work the land, to tall the fields, to take care of their children.  And these same people, they did not pay.  These same people, they raped, pillared, and plundered.  And to this day, they kill these same people or the descendants of these people.  The descendants of slaves.  Judgment is here on right-wing evangelicals.  Judgment is here on Americans because you all never considered us Americans.  Judgment is here.  Now, Tao ministries have warned you for years now.  You can go all the way back to the beginning.  You can go back to the fall of the Gentile powers, many teachings.  We've told you that.  The destruction of America was coming.  Now, many, even of our own people, say we were incorrect.  They stated that America was not Babylon.  We told them that America is Babylon because America fits the prophecies of Mystery Babylon, the great, the mother of harlots.  So if America is Babylon, and I think many are coming to realize this fact, then her destiny is to be destroyed.  At the end of the 400 years of the Hebrew Israelites, who are the Negroes, who are the descendants of slaves, at the end of the 400 year captivity in Babylon, in this nation, all hell breaks loose.  So, you know, people wanted to say that we were wrong.  that nothing would change.  They even did videos.  How come y'all still here?  I thought it was the end of the 400 years.  Well, if you took the time to do the study, you will see judgment comes on the whore first.  Those who enslaved Israel are judged first.  So now we have a world, at least on the surface, fighting for black folks.  We have around the world, people protesting for black folks.  Now, I do believe that the powers that be are trying to use this as a means to entrap us, to point the blame to the Negro, to point the blame to the true Hebrew Israelites, but they will not succeed.  Because the scripture states that they will look for our fault but not find it.  See, this is the agenda.  This is the agenda.  Now, you have many ministries like True News with Rick Wiles, and I'm calling him out because he acts like he's such a godly, God-fearing man.  Knowing, if you watch his show, that he's racist as they come.  He's racist as they come.  And he's so upset because America has been taken over according to them.  Now, if you have eyes to see, you will see that obviously America is under judgment.  Why?  You all state that it is because of abortions.  No, America is under judgment because she has enslaved God's chosen.  I've told you this.  I've told you this for years.  And then I told you that it's too late for repentance because you had a small window of repentance.  It's called reparations.  It's called letting God's people go.  For we need to leave so that we can worship our God in the wilderness, just like our ancestors did.  This time it's the wilderness among the people.  Tale Ministries have warned you.  Now, the bad thing is, and I guess it depends on your viewpoint of whether it's bad or not, is that this is just the beginning.  This is just the beginning.  First COVID, now protests.  Next is World War III.  Now, if you go and watch our videos, you will see that it's lining up just as we taught.  So the question is, did Tao ministries get lucky?  Or did Tao ministries get revelation from the Most High about what was going to occur?  Did Israelites... get the revelation of what was going to occur the true israelites?  how did we know these things were going to occur?  because as i've told you in the past the key to understanding prophecy is knowing who the true israelites are of the bible.  but you all reject that truth just as many of you all reject the truth of the scriptures.  now here's the thing.  We have people within our community who are falling away from the faith.  They reject the New Testament.  They reject Yeshua, who many call Jesus.  I get things from people who say, there was no J until 400 years ago.  Okay, now, I'm going to be a little harsh here.  This shows the lack of education.  And this shows the lack of willingness to do deep down study to understand how languages are used.  How transliteration occurs.  How it comes from Isu to Yesu to Jesus.  A lot of people lack education.  They think they can see.  But here's the thing.  Even if you have education, doesn't mean you can see.  Because the Holy Spirit must be your teacher and give you eyes to see.  The Lord will allow you to deceive yourself if your heart isn't pure, if your motives are not pure.  So some of our people have been deceived.  Some of them reject the Savior.  and many of the right-wing evangelicals have been deceived though they claim to accept the savior.  how can you love the messiah that you claim you know but you hate his people.  how can you love the messiah when you have tormented and killed his people?  now Right-wing evangelicals will say they love them some Jesus, right?  That's what they will tell you.  But when a black man gets shot, when a black man gets killed, who are the descendants of Jacob, where are the right-wing evangelicals?  They're silent.  That means their silence is tacit approval of the killing of black folks.  Right-wing evangelicals are gonna be the first are going to be one of the first.  that's going to be hit hard by the judgments because they are hypocrites, because they do not love truth, because they hate you for the black man, because they grew up in a racist system and a system that they benefit from that they wanted to continue.  Because they love that system more than they love the most high, they will be one of the first to be judged.  Judgment on right-wing evangelicals is here.  Judgment on Americans is here.  So while you all are waiting and preparing for what you call civil war, while you all are preparing for what you call the Chaikom invasion, many of the Hebrew Israelites are preparing to leave.  Many of the blacks, Negroes, you call us African Americans, are preparing their exodus because the prophecy states that God is gonna judge our enemies and he's gonna deliver us from the land of our captivity.  So just as you didn't believe the warning that came years ago from Teal Ministries and others of the Israelite community, neither will you adhere or listen to this one.  And bring the down arrows because I know I'm going to get them.  You can hit the dislikes.  That is fine.  But listen to the message.  We're about to leave.  We're about to leave.  And you don't have to believe it.  Just check our record on our teachings and see if what we said has not come to pass.  At the time we said it was going to happen.  It is the end of the 200.  I mean, it's the end of the 400 year captivity.  It's time for us to go.  This will probably be one of the last few that you get from tail because we're preparing to go.  So.  Judgment on the right wing evangelicals is here.  And Israel is not going to fight you.  The Negro is not going to fight you.  Even though you're preparing to kill black folks, as some of you all have stated, Israel is not preparing for war.  Israel is preparing for an exodus.  So you can get your guns, you can get your weapons, you can hunker down in your safety Locations.  We're not the problem.  Your own people.  Are the problem.  We're not the problem.  The chai comms.  They're not the problem.  You're the problem.  It's the racism in your heart.  It's the dislike for God's people.  And the.  Dislike for truth.  So.  Judgment.  Is at the house.  Of America.  And you see it.  Clear as day.  But you don't know why.  Peace and blessings Israel.  Your captivity.  Is ending. ",
