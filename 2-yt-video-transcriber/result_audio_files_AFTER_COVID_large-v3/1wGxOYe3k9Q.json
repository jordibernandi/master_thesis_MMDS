But you've set out in the Daily Express how you think we should get rid of the withdrawal agreement completely and simply tell the EU how it's going to be on fishing, state aid rules, trade, etc.  Can you set out your argument for us?

            "text": "Well, look, I mean, the truth of it is, the reason we have this big row going on with Brussels and people up in arms and admissions by government ministers that were about to break international law is because the chickens are coming home to roost from the withdrawal agreement and the attached political declaration from last year.  Mrs.  May had her draft treaty, which three times the House of Commons rejected.  She was, of course, then faced with a challenge in the Brexit party, which removed her as prime minister.  Inevitably, Boris Johnson became Prime Minister.  That was the only outcome that was ever going to happen.  He goes to Brussels in October and gets rid of the backstop.  Hooray!  Everybody's happy.  Isn't it wonderful?  This is a great deal.  And the truth of it was, it was very, very similar to Mrs May's deal.  The big fundamental difference, of course, was that without the backstop, the whole of the UK wouldn't necessarily be trapped inside the customs union rules, but Northern Ireland would effectively be hived off from the rest of the United Kingdom.  And when Johnson was asked about this, he just willfully, willfully said that wasn't the case.  Well, now they're realizing that if we were not to reach a trade deal with the European Union, that Northern Ireland could find itself with some of our products banned from going to the mainland into a separate part of the United Kingdom.  Hence the legislation they're putting in place.  But look, Boris is reneging on the withdrawal agreement, despite calling it an oven-ready deal, in other areas too, in state aid, in fishing.  The truth of it is the withdrawal agreement is a completely rotten deal.  It's a new EU treaty.  I didn't spend 25 years trying to leave the European Union and its treaties to sign us up to another one that even makes commitments in areas like foreign policy.  So I think the truth of it is we've realized the WA is no good.  I cannot see any point now in proceeding down this path.  Barnier will not change the withdrawal agreement.  All right?  He won't.  He just won't.  As far as he's concerned, That is banked.  It is ANU.  And he used to carry around in Strasbourg and Brussels the deal, the withdrawal agreement.  And he himself used to say, this is an international treaty.  It was an argument I tried to make last year, but nobody, but nobody was prepared to listen.  New prime minister with more energy and more optimism, but perhaps not more honesty.  If I was really addressing this, So they're not going to change it.  And that means the government potentially has a real problem.  So what does the government do?  Well, it could collapse, completely collapse, and sign up for a rotten deal that keeps us aligned.  But politically, that is very difficult.  And it would, you know, finish up with whichever way we cut this.  Northern Ireland being put in a very different category.  Or we say simply, look, we're wasting our time here.  We've made a terrible mistake with this withdrawal agreement.  We can't go on with it.  We're going to get rid of it.  But here is what we will do.  We agreed to pay you some money.  We won't renege on that.  No, I still don't agree with it.  But, you know, to show some sense that we do keep our word, at least on really important things.  But here's how it's going to be.  Here's how Fisheries will operate.  State rules we'll do with as we please.  This is how we are going to conduct ourselves in the future with you.  And by the way, in Ireland, we won't be putting a border in, but if you do want to put a border in, give Mr.  Trump a ring.  He's got some very good wall builders who perhaps could come and do it for you.  We tell them how it's going to be.  And on trade, we say, look, the World Trade Organization are happy to act as a neutral broker under Article 24 of their organization's rules.  That would mean we could go on trading tariff-free, quota-free, whilst we negotiate a more sensible new settlement.  And if the European Union were to refuse to do that, they would then face the wrath of German, French, Italian, and many other companies.  And I'm putting that forwards as a constructive suggestion as to how we can go on trading without tariff, but free ourselves from this terrible withdrawal agreement. ",

But, you know, I guess that's the past.  In terms of the public positions that are now being taken by the government, I want to give them the benefit of the doubt.  I mean, you know, they're going in the right direction.  They're doing the things I would, or beginning to do the things I would really want them to do.  I, you know, I very much hope they don't collapse.  I've been let down in the past by hoping the Conservatives would do the decent thing, but it does begin to feel that something has changed over the course of the last couple of weeks.  But the realities of this are sinking in.  And I think they've war-gamed this in the sense that there could be disruption at Dover.  Well, I tell you what, You know, there are all sorts of quarantine rules all over the place that have caused more disruption to travel and people's lives than anything that Brexit will do, even if we leave on WTO rules.  So I think they're beginning to understand that if it was a no deal or as they now brand it, Australian style Brexit, that that would not be a really big political problem for them. ",

I've always thought a deal would happen, but I was always worried as to how many concessions we would make to give that deal.  But I'm now beginning to think that if we're opening up the withdrawal agreement, I do not think that Barnier and Co will even contemplate it.  Treaties, I mean, these are the great tablets of stone in the European Union.  The European Commission call themselves the guardians of the treaties.  Treaties are everything in the European Union, and they have been ever since the Treaty of Rome and its foundation.  So if we're not going to have treaty change, We're going to need some very rapid movement from both sides to get something agreed.  It begins to feel like we're running out of time.  Which is why I put forward the Article 24 compromise as a means of keeping easy trade going whilst we rethink the next stage of this.  And we would be completely out.  There'd be no regulatory alignment.  There'll be no commitments to any EU rules.  There'll be no ECJ oversight.  All things that the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration, you know, leave us probably with years of arguments to come.  So there's a chance now to ditch the WA.  I hope they do. ",
