Now, you keep bringing up that I did it even after the January 6th insurrection, which, again, I think is despicable.  despicable, and I absolutely condemn.  But the people who changed their vote because of that, I believe they were doing it because of political expedience, either if they were going to contest or if they weren't going to contest.

            "text": "This is CNN's Pamela Brown holding freshman Republican lawmaker Madison Cawthorn's feet to the fire and demanding actual proof, any proof, to back up his vote to block certification of the election and ultimately prevent Joe Biden from taking office.  And the way that Cawthorn dissembles goes to show that these people never actually bothered to find any legitimate justification, they just decided they were entitled to winning an election that they lost.  Now clearly Republicans like Cawthorn have been scrambling to try and retroactively legitimize their efforts to overturn the election in their desperation to not look like the seditious hacks that they are.  And so for Cawthorn, he's decided that the excuse he'll land on is that the manner in which drop boxes were installed in Wisconsin was unconstitutional.  That's the sticking point for him.  You see, he swore an oath.  And he knew that the Founding Fathers, the framers of the Constitution, would be rolling in their graves that people could safely vote during a pandemic, and so that's why he decided to stop the certification of a duly elected president.  He did it not for Trump or to raise his own profile, he did it for James Madison.  In reality, while Madison Cawthorn has unilaterally decided to be the voice of the framers, the issue of drop boxes in Wisconsin was already adjudicated.  A federal judge in Milwaukee, Judge Brett Ludwig, a Trump appointee, heard this case wherein Trump's team accused a group of state and local election officials of violating state law by expanding the manner in which absentee ballots were received and processed during the pandemic.  And unlike other judges, Ludwig didn't dismiss for lack of standing, he actually decided to hear the case and judge on the merits.  He held a day long hearing on the matter, and yet after actually hearing the case, he had not only dismissed it, but did so with prejudice, meaning Trump wouldn't have been able to refile.  He wrote quote, this court has allowed the plaintiff the chance to make his case and he has lost on the merits.  And despite Madison Cawthorn unilaterally declaring himself the arbiter of all things legal, the Trump-appointed federal judge said that Wisconsin's election officials had followed state law, and that even though they instituted changes like allowing drop boxes for absentee ballots, the moves were not illegal and officials use acceptable ways to implement the law.  And as if that wasn't clear enough, Judge Ludwig then went on to note that the Trump campaign was aware of these changes months before they were put in place and should have challenged them then, instead of waiting until Trump lost to suddenly decide that they were unconstitutional.  It's almost like the judge realized, and bear with me here, that this wasn't actually actually about the legality of drop boxes, but was rather just a pretext to try and overturn election results that they didn't like using any excuse humanly possible.  Imagine that.  The judge ended with this, for all of the Madison Cawthorns out there who apparently needed to see it written in black and white.  This is an extraordinary case.  A sitting president who did not prevail in his bid for re-election has asked for federal court help in setting aside the popular vote based on disputed election administration issues he plainly could have raised before the vote occurred.  In his reply brief, Plaintiff asks that the rule of law be followed.  It has been.  But hey, thank goodness we have Madison Cawthorn, who will fight for the Constitution even when the states and the judges apparently all got it wrong.  Evidently, he is the lone person in government who's quote, defending the Constitution.  Cawthorn then says that he moved forward with his decision to object to the results because he's a constitutional originalist, and the Constitution states that the federal government can't go into the states and dictate laws, which is why he, as a federal lawmaker, supported disenfranchising millions of voters from four states that weren't his.  I mean, this is beyond parody.  He's not even a representative of any of the states.  he tried to overturn the election results in, and yet as a federal official, he decided that the citizens of those states shouldn't have a voice, all while making the argument that the federal government shouldn't go into the states and dictate laws.  Yeah, no, makes total sense.  So look, we could go on all day debunking Cawthorn's individual arguments, but what's beyond clear is that this was never about defending the Constitution, it was never about protecting the states, it wasn't about the rule of law, it was about trying to keep Trump in office and then reverse engineering some tepid excuse to defend himself once the whole plan went south.  People like Madison Cawthorn began his political career attempting to subvert the will of Americans.  So he can try this whole redemption tour thing all he wants, but we know better.  He is as seditious as Donald Trump.  and that will always be his legacy. ",
