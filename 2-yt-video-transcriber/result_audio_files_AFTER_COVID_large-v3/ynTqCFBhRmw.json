There's nothing green in there, and if you look at the... activity of the brain, it doesn't look like a green apple, and there's no direct connection that we can make between that activity and the actual experience as an experience of a green apple.  So that's what's been called the hard problem.  And by the way, the notion that this is a hard problem has been known for centuries, right?  So Thomas Huxley in the 19th century talked about this as the very, very hard problem.  He said it's as mysterious as having a gin pop out of a bottle.  And John Locke talked about this problem in 1690, saying that he had no idea how to make a connection between our conscious experiences and any physical activity of our body. ",

I mean, we can find specific neural correlates of color perception, motion perception, and we know that if you have damage to area MT or V5, you can lose motion perception.  V4, you can lose color perception.  So we know there are these very, very strong neural correlates of consciousness.  The question is, how do you go from those neural correlates to either a causal theory?  How does that neural activity cause the experience to happen?  or some kind of identity theory.  Can we say that conscious experiences of a green apple is identical to neural activity?  But when you look at it, no one has come up with a scientific theory that will make even the most basic prediction that says this kind of neural activity has to be the smell of a rose.  It could not be the color red for these mathematically precise reasons.  And if you make this small change in the neural activity, you will necessarily change to the taste of chocolate. ",

Suppose that we actually found that you experienced a particular color of red, say red 31.  If and only if this particular neuron, and we can name it, neuron 6 billion 55, fires at 30 hertz.  And it's this amazing discovery that in everybody's brain, neuron 1 billion and 55, when it fires at 30 hertz, you experience red 31.  You get your Nobel Prize.  That's an amazing discovery.  But has that solved the problem that we're talking about here, about how does neural activity cause the experience of red?  Not at all.  Now the mystery is intensified.  How could it be?  that sodium and potassium and calcium ions going through holes in membranes of this particular neuron causes my experience of Red 31.  Now the mystery is even more intensified.

Maybe consciousness isn't identical or arises from neurobiology per se, but maybe it's some kind of functional properties of the neurobiology.  And again, it's tempting.  My degree was in artificial intelligence at MIT.  I mean, we were doing functional models.  And yet, I couldn't and nobody has yet been able to find a way to go from those functional models to a theory that gets consciousness coming out without a miracle occurring.  What I don't want is a miracle at the critical stage.  There are these functional properties of neurons, then consciousness comes out, but I don't want to have a miracle happen right at that key point.  Scientists have to put their miracles up front, right?  Those are our assumptions.  We just put them on the table.  These are our miracles, our assumptions.  After that, it's no fair.  It's not fair to put any miracle anywhere else, especially not at the key point where consciousness emerges.  And so it was because I didn't want to put a miracle there, and I couldn't think of a way to do it, starting with physical or functional primitives, assumptions, that I said, okay, let's back off.  We have mind and body, consciousness and the physical brain.  We've been trying to solve the problem, starting with physical or functional primitives.  And then getting to consciousness.  What would happen if we start from the other direction?  As a purely scientific and rigorous approach.  So we're not talking about mysticism or anything like that.  I'm saying, can we get a mathematically precise model of consciousness on its own terms?  Where we have to then, you know, put down mathematical structures, not because they're right, but so that we're precise.  So that we can then find out why we're precisely wrong.  So the idea is, let's put down a mathematical model of consciousness.  Of course it's not going to be right.  That's what science always does.  But you get it down there, at least it's rigorous.  Now you start to make predictions.  You get a dynamics of consciousness.  The test will be, can you derive quantum physics from it?  Can you get the wave equation of a free particle?  Can you get spinners?  Can you get spin networks?  Can you get quantum field theory out of it?  Because if you can, then at least you have a mathematically precise solution of the mind-body problem starting in the other direction.  So I don't want a hand wave.  What I want is a mathematical model of consciousness that any mathematician would recognize is well-specified, that any empirical scientist in the field would say is not completely implausible as an empirical model of the empirical data about consciousness.  And then the real test of solving the mind-body problem is can I take that model and without any hand waves, no miracles, get, say, quantum field theory popping out of it.  That would then be a big bridge towards solving the mind-body problem from the other direction.  That would be the first pontoon over the river.  You'd then want to then colonize and do lots of other... We need to understand all of human psychology and how brain science relates to all aspects of human perception and cognition.  But if we can get the bridge from a basic model of consciousness to, say, quantum field theory, now we've got something to build on.  And that's been my project. ",
