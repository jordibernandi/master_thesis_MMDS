They must receive hazard pay for the dangerous work that they do.  I get a little bit tired of seeing these TV ads from big corporations thanking their heroes who are out on the front lines.  Well, that's great.  Thank them.  but pay them, pay them hazardous pay for the dangerous work that they are doing.  We can no longer allow multi-billion dollar corporations like Amazon, Walmart, and Tyson Foods to treat essential workers like expendable workers, like sacrificial workers.  We can no longer allow multi-billion dollar corporations to run advertising calling their workers heroes.  while paying them starvation wages and treating them disrespectfully. ",
