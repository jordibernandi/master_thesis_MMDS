            "text": "So by now, unless you're living under a rock, then I'm sure you've heard about Donald Trump's epic interview with Jonathan Swan on Axios.  It's about 35 minutes long.  It was posted to HBO's YouTube channel.  And I've got to say, this was thoroughly entertaining.  I didn't watch it like directly.  I kind of had it on in the background while I was playing Ghost of Tsushima.  Great game, by the way.  And there were moments where I paused the game like mid-battle because I had to like go back and And listen to what Trump said again, because what he said was so stupid and like the things that he said, they ranged from being hysterical, like genuinely funny to downright disturbing where I was angry.  So, I mean, in this interview, you're taken on a ride, right?  You go through all the range of emotions at one moment.  You'll be pissed.  The next moment he'll say something stupid and then you'll laugh.  I've got to give credit to Jonathan Swan because he did a phenomenal job at pushing back on Donald Trump.  And honestly, from a journalistic standpoint, this is one of the best interviews I think I've ever seen.  He really did a good job at bringing statistics, at challenging Donald Trump.  He didn't let Trump get by on anything.  But at the same time, he didn't come off as overly combative.  He tried to give Trump credit where it was due.  But he also called out the lies.  And it really was a fantastic interview.  So if you haven't seen the interview, I would encourage you to stop watching this video.  Watch the entire thing.  It's long.  I get it.  But it's worth it.  I mean, it's so long you could have it on in the background.  But I swear to God, every time I turned around and stopped playing the game to look at what Donald Trump had said, his hands were like that the entire time.  So you know whenever he's doing this, he's really struggling to collect his thoughts.  and um he's like really concentrating.  uh the interview was bananas so we're gonna start off you know.  um on a lighter note because i want to definitely talk through these highlights here.  so contrary to popular belief according to donald trump he does in fact read um.  so he was asked by jonathan swan whether or not he reads his daily briefings.  um his answer here was um It was weird.  I'm not going to give you any more setup.  Just watch. ",

Because I mean, like a normal, well-adjusted human being doesn't say something like that.  Like what a weird hyperbolic statement to make.  Oh, no, I actually do read and I comprehended better than anyone you've ever interviewed.  I mean, that's so strange.  Like, way to suck himself off.  The next thing that I want to go over is what he said when he was asked about the late John Lewis, civil rights icon, because, of course, he found a way to make John Lewis's legacy about himself, because why wouldn't he?

I think that Jonathan Swan himself deserves credit for being funny because he was clearly animated like you can read what he was feeling on his face and And like whenever I was like watching him, like as I was going through trying to prep for the segment, like I'm scrolling through and you can see like Jonathan's facial reactions and he's clearly like just puzzled by things that Donald Trump said.  So moving on, that was kind of the more lighthearted, entertaining aspects of the interview.  But there are some elements of the interview where where it was downright disturbing that the president said this.  Like some of what he says, he can get away with it because it's funny.  And he's just a stupid person.  But things like this, where it comes to COVID-19 and the deaths that it's caused, he inadvertently revealed his callousness.  And this is where the interview, you know, it takes a turn for the disturbing.  And this is where I got pissed off. ",

It is what it is in response to the deaths.  with regard to COVID-19.  Now, Jonathan Zwan pressed him on the deaths a little bit more, and Trump tried to debunk the facts that Jonathan was bringing to his attention, and he was fumbling through these papers to try to show him statistics.

Now, unsurprisingly, he once again repeated the lie that the reason why we're seeing an increase in cases is because we're doing more testing, completely disregarding the positivity rate.  And on top of that, he wants you to only look at a specific metric when it comes to deaths.  He wants you to look at the proportion of deaths compared to the amount of cases.  So what is the fatality rate of among people who have COVID-19.  Now ask yourself, why does he want us to look at this specifically?  Well, let's simplify it.  So let's say 100 people got COVID-19 and 10 people died.  What would the fatality rate be in that instance?  It'd be 10%, obviously, right?  So let's say that cases went up.  There were 1,000 cases and 100 people died.  well, in that instance, the fatality rate would remain the same.  It's at 10%.  So if the fatality rate remains the same, or preferably it goes down, that makes Donald Trump look better.  But specifically, looking at that metric ignores the fact that deaths overall are increasing.  It ignores the fact that in that hypothetical, we went from 10 deaths to 100 deaths, even if the fatality rate among people who have COVID-19 remained the same.  So that's why he told Jonathan Swan, oh, you can't look at that.  You're not reporting that correctly.  Because when you look at overall deaths based on population, it makes him look bad.  Now, as Jonathan Swan conceded, like you can look at, you know, the fatality rate, of course, like we're looking at all metrics.  We're not trying to hide information and data.  That's what Trump is doing.  But he's selectively trying to select data.  that makes him look better.  And it's insane.  And thankfully, for the first time, he was actually called out to his face for lying.  Now, moving on, he was asked about the Afghanistan war and Jonathan Swan called him out and, you know, basically pressed him to explain why if you campaign as an anti-war politician back in 2016, why are we still in Afghanistan?  The answer here was really telling because Trump, he was backed into a corner and he didn't know what to say because he clearly looked like a fraud. ",

You campaigned as an anti-war libertarian-esque candidate back in 2016, and we're still not out of the wars.  Almost four years later, you've been president.  We're still there.  So why isn't the number of troops in Afghanistan zero?  Why are you still conducting illegal drone strikes in other countries?  It's because Donald Trump is a fraud.  Sometimes, you know, he'll use that libertarian-esque anti-war rhetoric, but then other times he sounds like a bloodthirsty, saber-rattling warmonger, because he is.  So, I mean, the inconsistency there, he has to address it.  And when he tries to address it, when someone asks him about this, he's clearly clueless.  He doesn't know what to say.  Now, another area where he's inconsistent is mail-in voting.  And Jonathan Swan asked him, Why are you railing against mail-in voting when your campaign is instructing Republican Party voters how to safely vote by mail?  And Donald Trump here unraveled because, again, like when you are called out and confronted in this direct manner with facts.  You have no idea what to do, especially if you're Donald Trump.  So all he does usually is when confronted, he just lies or he pivots to the great job that he's doing.  Or, you know, in this instance, he actually did try to defend himself by saying, well, I have to promote mail-in voting because I have no choice.  But that defeats the purpose of his arguments against mail-in voting.  Nonetheless, take a look and we'll come back and discuss this. ",

He doesn't want vote by mail because if more people vote by mail, that means that turnout will likely be increased.  And when turnout is high, what happens?  Republicans lose elections because they count on suppressing enough votes to win.  But at the end of the day, you just have to watch the interview for yourself to see.
