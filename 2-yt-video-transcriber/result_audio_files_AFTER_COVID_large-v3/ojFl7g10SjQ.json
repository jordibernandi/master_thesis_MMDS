            "text": "Donald Trump gives QAnon a finger on the final last day.  Q, I feel your pain, even though as an AI, you yourself cannot feel pain.  QAnon followers, I feel your pain also, but unfortunately, I don't feel sorry for all you hopeless romantics, because for three and a half years I've been yelling on the rooftops, QAnon is a psyop, a Mossad psyop.  But it fell on deaf ears, so here we are, on the day of reckoning, the final last day.  And Donald Trump says, goodbye Q, hello bankers.  You see, the problem with you poor QAnon folks is you don't have $1.3 billion hidden on offshore accounts.  You see, Donnie prefers to work for men like Shalom and Philippe, who can steal $1.3 billion, or even if you can steal $66 million, that's great.  So as Trump and his spoiled lot of bastard children go to Florida and golf their life away with the other criminals he pardoned, here you are.  Still you have no good job.  Still you have no position in life.  Because Obama gave those positions to Somalis and Kenyans.  You still have to pay taxes so those Somali kids can go to school and get a cushy government job when they grow up.  And all the while, there you sit in stew and anger over the Mossad-Syop pipe dream.  Military tribunal trials to put Hillary and her like of government criminal cronies in jail.  Don't make me laugh.  But hey, we all deserve a good pipe dream once in a while.  And you got a beauty, didn't you?  What you expected was government criminals put on trial.  What you got was government puppet Trump giving pardons to criminal Wall Street bankers, thugs, and con artists.  Life's a bitch, and we move on. ",
