            "text": "So Donald Trump is very worried about the attention that the the DNC, the Democratic National Convention, is going to get this week.  And one of the things they're doing is having campaign advisers kind of manage expectations.  Their float.  Trump campaign advisers are floating the idea that Joe Biden might get an eight to 10 point bump this week from the DNC.  Now, that's extremely unlikely.  But the idea is if they say Biden could get eight to 10 when Biden gets three or four, which is typical from a convention, they can say, oh, no, Biden underperformed.  Nobody likes him.  We expected him to get eight to 10 points, but he only got three or four.  So they're doing that.  Trump's flying to multiple cities this week to do rally like events, which we'll be covering separately.  So I won't spend a ton of time on that right now.  And in addition to this, Donald Trump is also doing a bunch of interviews.  He's doing a bunch of press and he started off the week on Fox and Friends again.  And it went really badly.  before we start with the politics.  I want to start with the strangest moment.  Donald Trump's younger brother, Robert Trump, tragically passed away over the weekend in his early 70s.  Trump, of course, struggles to show any emotion or human connection asked about it.  He's Trump says they say.  Robert was my best friend, which is really weird language to use about your supposed best friend and brother.  Take a look at this bizarre video. ",

I knew you were able to get to the hospital before your brother, Robert, died here in New York City.  We are so sorry for your loss.  Well, I appreciate it.  It was not not a great weekend.  It's very hard.  You knew it was going to happen.  When it happens, it's a very tough thing.  He was a great guy.  He was a tremendous guy.  You know, he was my friend.  I guess they say best friend.  And that's true.  And, you know, losing him, not easy. ",

What I think is that the statement that was put out by the White House quoting Trump saying he was my best friend, Trump didn't really write it.  And Trump didn't really say it.  So when Trump says they say he was my best friend, he really means the people who wrote the statement attributing that quote to me.  They said he was my best friend.  And I guess he sort of was.  And then lastly, Trump is asked again about his late brother, Robert Trump.  And Trump's sort of eulogy was about Trump wasn't?  Robert?  Trump wasn't jealous of my success and he thought I was a great president.  Like, it's all about Trump, if you can believe that was loyal people. ",

Especially among children and among children that are competitive children.  Because he was very competitive.  There was not an ounce of jealousy.  He'd go around talking about how great this is for the country.  And it's so incredible.  And he was my biggest fan.  People would tell me all the time, I spoke to your brother and your brother was... We're so thrilled and so thrilled at what was happening.  and what was happening for the country was he was so angry with China because of what happened, where the plague came in and they shouldn't have allowed it to happen.  They could have stopped it.  He was so upset by that.  It was he couldn't more than people would be upset.  A lot of people have already forgotten and you can't forget.  But he was a fantastic guy.

This is not a person with normal emotion or with normal emotional connections to others.  So that's out of the way.  Let's now get into the political stuff.  Trump, again, just insisting everything's fine with the virus and says without his border wall, which Mexico was going to pay for but didn't, and which he was going to build across the entire U.S.-Mexico border, but didn't.  He says without that border wall, things would be much worse, which is ridiculous.  Take a look. ",

Mexico is heavy, heavy COVID territory.  They're highly infected.  I built the wall and that wall to stop people from coming in.

And to add some facts to this, Trump says if it weren't for his two hundred and eighty miles of wall, which is like nothing, by the way, we would have hundreds of thousands of additional cases coming in from Mexico.  The numbers just don't bear this out.  Number one, in total cases, Mexico has 10 percent of the cases that we do now.  Mexico has fewer people.  That's true.  So per capita, the US is eighth in cases and Mexico is 57th.  That's per capita.  Now, that can depend on testing.  Well, in the US, we are 10th in deaths per capita.  Mexico is 13th in deaths per capita.  So it's a complete fantasy world.  Fox and Friends allows it completely uncritically.  Then Trump starts to insist that the world is calling him because he's so good at dealing with Turkish President Erdogan.  Nobody knows how to deal with Erdogan other than Trump.  Trump tuning his own horn here.  Take a look. ",
