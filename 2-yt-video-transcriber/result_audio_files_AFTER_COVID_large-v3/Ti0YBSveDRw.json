Now with this coronavirus, we spotted it late last year.  And by early January, it was clear this thing was a real problem and it was coming all around the country.  So what could we have done?  We could have done a lot more planning early on.  You know, get ready.  Stockpile the masks to make sure there are plenty of them so everybody who needs them has got access to them.  Same thing for the gowns.  Same things for the ventilators.  That's a big part of what I think is government's responsibility is to plan.  There's a lot we could have done earlier.
