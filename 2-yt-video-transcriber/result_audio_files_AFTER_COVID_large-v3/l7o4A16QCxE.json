You know, Trump supporters like to throw around, like, Trump derangement syndrome as, like, you know, liberals being crazy.  I, like, think of it as, actually, you're the one that has Trump derangement syndrome.  You're losing your goddamn mind as soon as, like, because they're just like, Trump 2020, and it's like, That sounds a little more deranged to me when you end every argument than that.  Like even, like, hashtag the MAGA or hashtag MAGA 2020.  It's political, it stays up.  Yeah, but not for you.  No, I don't know.  Deleted.  Yeah.  So it's like, delete any positive Trump supporter stuff.  But if it makes him look bad... You have to take it down, but I leave it up.  You leave it up. ",

Like, for example, like racial stuff.  Okay.  You could call me white trash based on being white.  But I can't, but if you say Asian trash, black trash, brown trash, we got to delete stuff like that.
