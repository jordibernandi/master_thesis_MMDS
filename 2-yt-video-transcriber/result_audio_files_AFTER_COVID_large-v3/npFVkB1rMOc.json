What people saw yesterday was me doing vocal exercises, me just kind of, you know, putting myself out there for the first time.  The industry just doesn't want a white male unless they're literally storming the Capitol.  You know, obviously save the children and do a coup, but also, you know, as important or even more important is to just try to like, you know, build my socials.  This is my American Idol.  This is my The Voice.  I think there is a hole in the market for sort of this like reactionary psychopath.  That's also very musical.  When I first started working with Q, I thought Q met Quincy Jones.  People said to me, what was yesterday?  Was it a revolution?  Was it a coup?  It was an exercise in branding.  We have no problem with the Capitol Police, by the way.  We have no problem.  They were nice to us.  We took selfies with them.  They let us in.  You know, we met a lot of them on 4chan.  Sometimes I'm sad and I feel like there's not a space for men to share their feelings.  in this country and I think that's tragic.  I'm willing to learn and grow.  I've been reading a lot of tweets about my behavior that are making a lot of sense to me.  And I'm going like back in my childhood and I'm going, yeah, yeah, that was it.  Yeah, that was it.  It's okay if I like the show Shrill on Hulu.  It's my favorite show.  And I can admit that.  Like I like it because it's a big, powerful woman that's confident and that makes me happy.  I'm the victim. ",
