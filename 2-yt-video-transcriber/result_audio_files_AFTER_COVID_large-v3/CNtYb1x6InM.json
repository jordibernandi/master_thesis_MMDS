            "text": "President Putin was very, very strong.  He even called me brilliant.  Isn't that nice?  Putin has much better leadership qualities than Obama.  I have President Putin.  He just said it's not Russia.  I will say this.  I don't see any reason why it would be.  Him, John, he really has been very open.  I think very honorable.  He's the boss.  It's incredible.  He wiped out the uncle.  He wiped out this one, that one.  And then we fell in love.  He wrote me beautiful letters.  Kim is a brutal dictator.  He runs a police state, forced starvation, labor camps.  He's assassinating members of his own family.  How do you trust a killer like that?  I met him.  I've spoken with him.  I think that he really wants to do a great job for North Korea.  His country does love him.  They have a great fervor.  I like the Saudis.  They're very nice.  I make a lot of money with them.  They buy all sorts of my stuff.  All kinds of toys from Trump.  They pay me millions and hundreds of millions.  And I get along great with all of them.  They buy apartments from me.  They spend 40 million, 50 million.  We are with Saudi Arabia.  We're staying with Saudi Arabia.  We've become very good friends.  NATO is obsolete.  The European Union is a foe.  The European Union was set up to take advantage of the United States.  We're not negotiating with Canada right now.  Germany is a disgrace. ",
