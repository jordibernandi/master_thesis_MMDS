The government refuses to say how many companies it invited to bid for it, and the Department of Health won't give us any details about what the original contract was for.  Faculty had no track record in the NHS beyond one, project managing staff's time in a clinic.  It remains unclear why it was selected to transform the NHS through AI.  Some say the link is Mr.  Dominic Cummings.  After Cummings was appointed chief advisor to Boris Johnson, Ben Warner, a faculty data scientist who worked with him on the Vote Leave project, was hired as an advisor to Number 10 on data and technology.  Warner just happens to be the brother of Mark Warner, the co-founder and chief executive of Faculty.  I'd say it's just a coincidence if it wasn't that a private company owned by Dominic Cummings paid more than a quarter of a million pounds to faculty.  He has declined to explain the reason for the payment and faculty also declined to say what they were for.  The company's shareholders include two current and former Conservative ministers.  Another company involved is Palantir, a software data company with some controversy.  Its role has recently been extended and gone beyond an original focus on ventilators to also include other care during the pandemic.  The contract with the NHS does indicate that Palantir is allowed to negotiate its own arrangements on intellectual property with third parties going forward, which third parties are not specified. ",
