            "text": "shalom.  call her law yahweh yahushua.  double honors unto the apostles and the elders.  salutations to all my fellow laborers doing this work in truth and sincerity risking their lives and their freedom to do so now more so than ever.  to the scattered elect that are scattered around the four corners of the earth.  that be like unto the speckled bird the Israelite foreigners.  To you, I say, Shalom, and to the few Akwa that are listening and learning.  This is your brother, Malcolm, from the branch of the Great Millstone here in Chicago.  And once again, a special shout out to the Israelite foreigners that are scattered abroad.  All right, this is Isaiah 16 and four.  Let my outcasts dwell with thee, Moab.  Be thou a covert to them from the face of the spoiler.  For the extortioner is at an end, the spoiler ceaseth, the oppressors are consumed out of the land.  The spoilers and the oppressors are Esau Edom, the so-called white man.  Moab are the so-called Chinese and the Koreans.  Covert, hidden, private, secret, concealed.  And this is from the online dictionary, etymology dictionary online.  Etymology mean the study of words, so the truth in words, all right?  The origins of them, what they mean.  Okay, covert, hidden, private, secret, concealed.  From French covert, modern covert, hidden, obscure, unhanded, literally covered.  All right.  Past participle, covier, to cover.  Once again, Isaiah 4 and 6.  That's Salaki, 16 and 4.  Let mine outcast dwell with thee.  Moab, be thou a covert to them from the face of the spoiler.  So Israelites, Judah was hidden among the people of Moab.  Bruce Lee, Brandon Lee.  The Chinese Hercules, what was his name?  Bolo Yung.  And these guys that we're about to watch, the ones who got that flavor, who got that salt, who has that spirit of an Israelite.  So let's cue it up.  Oh, my God.  Oh, that's hot.  Words of the Bible ring true.  This is Tobit.  the 13th chapter and the second verse.  For he does scourge and have mercy.  He leadeth down to hell and bringeth up again.  Hell is a condition.  Neither is there any that can avoid his hand.  Confess him before the Gentiles, ye children of Israel, for he has scattered us among them.  Oh my God.  Qal halal, yehawabashim avashai, bahashim rechak v'dash, wa'abababal, shalawam, kwam yasharawah. ",
