            "text": "There are too many communists in this country.  More and more every election.  More!  Now let's stomp four times.  One, two, three, four.  We have to do something.  We must do something.  Do you think it's time?  It is time.  Do you think it's time?  Let's do this.  The Staff of Freedom.  It's so... Beautiful.  What are you?  Rob, we're down here below the Lincoln Memorial in the Turning Point bunker, and we push the button.  This artifact appeared.  Is that something that could be used to bring forth liberal tears?  What's going on, pumpies?  How we doing?  What is it?  Should we try to put them together like infinity stones?  Whoa!  Look at all these dirty communists!  Dude!  These guys suck!  Awesome to be with all of you here in Palm Beach, Florida, in person.  I think we have all 50 states represented here.  And look, all you have to do tonight is take out your rally sign and write Black Lives Matter on the back of your rally sign, and none of you will get the Chinese coronavirus tonight.  How many of you flew here to the Student Action Summit?  Welcome, by the way.  Who here traveled the longest distance?  Do we have any Alaska activists?  Alaska?  Makes no sense.  The reason, more than anything else, is that the airlines are a very, very powerful lobby.  The airlines have a lot of political clouts.  The airlines have nicely selected political contributions and donors that give them the opportunity to have those carve-outs.  Some take it well.  Sorry, that's a no.  And some don't.  No, really, you can't get on that floor.  Now, I'm not saying the mask caused the disease, but if you looked at the chart, you could actually say, oh, my goodness, the masks are causing the disease.  They're lying to you.  Now, I'm not saying all masks don't work.  The cloth mask, if you do a penetration, but you're also wearing the mask because they want you to submit.  You know, I am a little bit of a rebel.  I don't wear my mask.  The science that when you get a disease, you get natural immunity.  How many people that they've sort of confirmed have gotten it twice?  Five.  So you got five out of 16 million.  Does that sound like the rule or the exception?  Okay, okay, I'm your biggest fan.  My name's Matt Gaetz.  With the people whose votes weren't validated, who came in by the mail, Joe Biden was getting vote totals that would have made Bashar al-Assad blush.  Now in 2016, I stand before you, the only Republican in the United States Congress who will not accept a single dollar in political action committee donations.  Their money is no good with me.  ...earthright to rich members of the Chinese Communist Party who can come here, have Han Chinese that they believe will be just as American as you or I. to tell someone that they don't understand because of their racial color.  He's fighting for equality, but if you tell someone to not get involved that he doesn't understand because of his color, you're kind of being a hypocrite there.  I like that.  Socialism sucks.  I think I've heard that before.  That's good.  Garbage.  It was me who used the phrase Kraken first.  Look it up.  It's on Instagram.  Release the Kraken.  And God willing, my future boss... ...received more votes in this election than any president in American history.  From George Washington... to Barack Hussein Obama.  More votes than any previous president.  A misogynist, an Islamophobe, a white supremacist, and even a Nazi.  A cognitively challenged, senile, machine politician of the last 47 years, hiding in his basement for eight months, got more votes than the first black president?  Are you kidding?  That's all the evidence I need.  Hey, can I take your picture before I begin?  Okay, here we go.  Thank you.  I actually use... Do you all know what this is, by the way?  And vast numbers of young Americans don't have both, especially don't have a father.  And the data on not having a father in one's life... I'm not talking about if your father died of cancer or in a war.  You had a father.  I'm talking about those who didn't have a father.  who began without a father because the father abandoned the mother that he impregnated.  And do you know what I think the ugliest of human traits is?  Ingratitude.  You knew?  Good.  The man in that row with that hat knew what I was going to say.  Greater numbers of blacks have come to the United States willingly than came here unwillingly.  That is why in the last 20 years alone, 3 million blacks, 2 million from Africa, 1 million from the Caribbean have come to America.  I have millions of blacks from Africa.  Tens of millions have come voluntarily.  How many of you learned that at college?  Answer, probably close to zero.  you are black, white, brown, yellow, or red, you are damn lucky to be an American, whatever your color.  There is no racism outside of the Ku Klux Klan that matches the racism of the left.  And I... I haven't been in a room with other people.  Oh, you are too.  I'm not often called sexy where I live.  Those are the people you're freaking me out, dude.  You're wondering why big companies across the country are now offering to freeze the eggs of their female employees.  It's not because they're compassionate.  It's because they're demanding that you give them the best years of your life to serve them.  Sell more widgets for them and juice the stock price.  And in return you get what?  Nothing.  They don't know your last name.  But they'll freeze your eggs because we're a compassionate, enlightened company.  But I suspect there are a lot of people like under 30 here, right?  Charlie made that claim.  I could get up here and tell you about my sex life, not that you'd be interested.  It means don't delay adulthood.  Don't delay full life.  You should get married as soon as you can.  And you should do it while you're too young.  And I'm deeply ideological.  I don't say that as a point of pride.  I say that as a confession.  I think you can be too ideological.  Gab pens right now in your pockets.  But the reason, yeah, you've got a dab pen, baby.  Okay, hold on.  This guy, where's the weird kid who's been heckling me?  Do you have a question?  Didn't you guys have a question?  I'll take one question.  Charlie made that.  Palm Beach County, not exactly a conservative place, so I guess they're trying to make it difficult.  We're sort of used to... Where is Hunter?  I mean... Hey!  Guys, it's me!  Screw it!  We don't... It's not like there's a script.  I just get out here and do my thing, so, you know?  You're gonna do whatever you can to get that next rock.  It doesn't matter.  You'll hustle for three days.  Doesn't matter.  My testosterone is never going into the single digits.  I'd start getting worried if I wasn't in like four digits like it.  Okay, so you could be woke today by tomorrow.  You're all right.  Well, I'm glad you missed me.  I'm glad you but yeah, you didn't know that wasn't really posting much.  You know, you didn't have it.  I Actually, I have engagement.  It's almost like a hundred million a week.  I'm averaging like 35,000 likes a post last couple weeks as a general in the meme wars.  and It's not like it's a racial, I mean, like Native American Indians.  I mean, it's what they are.  And guess what?  I mean, I did have a degree in marketing from Wharton as well as one of, you know, my degrees.  So I'm sitting there with the Indians.  I'm like, I can't believe this shit, right?  It's just enough.  And it was interesting because my father sort of said to me, he's like, hey, listen, don't be so glib.  And I'm like, wait a minute.  Like, you're like Mr.  Glib, Mr.  All In all the time.  He's like, yeah, but you've never seen a down cycle.  You've never seen how bad it can get.  And so then 08 sort of rolls around.  We'll go knock down their monuments, because namby-pambys that they are, they wouldn't dream of knocking down our monuments.  We are in a domestic, domestic Cold War.  against a domestic opponent, a cold civil war, you might say.  Socialism, when you think about it, is typically, you think of it in terms of economic confiscation.  It's all about appropriating wealth.  But the real goal of the socialists, we have a scene in Trump card, it's drawn from Orwell's 1984.  I really appreciate the very tepid applause.  When I grew up, I listened to Rage Against the Machine.  It doesn't get any more lefty than those guys, Tom Morello.  They're like socialists.  And you know what one of their lines was?  Don't ever forget this.  I won't, I'll try not to curse again.  Sorry, young kids, I'm sorry.  But I come from New York.  But one of the lines in one of their songs, I'll just say, it said, screw you, I won't do, that wasn't the word they used, but I won't do what you told me.  Screw you, I won't do what you told me.  Screw you, I won't do what you told me.  That was the left, these anti-authoritarians, and now they're the authoritarians.  They want to shut you up, and you had the guts to come out here today.  You know, I had this cool speech written.  I was going to pop a wheelie and be really fun.  It was going to be a lot of fun talking about it.  You want one more?  We can do one more.  There we go.  Please get on the phone, call your congressman, and feel free.  You can lightly threaten them.  Andrew and I were sitting in a hotel room one night, Andrew Breitbart, the late Andrew Breitbart, he says, there needs to be a mascot for these retractions.  Maybe an animal, like a mascot, like a monkey or an elephant, like a... No?  How about a llama?  No.  How about an alpaca?  And then, Retracto, the correction alpaca, was born.  Cue the Retracto theme song.  Song!  Come on, let's go!  One, two, three, four!  We're gonna start a revolution!  And we need a new solution!  Gonna smash and break right through them all!  Totally made that claim.  The law is around the corner.  Never knowing who's going to kill you.  Are you the next one to be murked?  You never know if it's a friend or a foe.
