So what I do and what an advertiser does or a high-priced corporate lawyer, a lot of these jobs are not essential to keep us alive one more day.  A fracker is, a farmer is, a trucker is, and yet somehow we've lumped these people in as the losers of globalization, the people who are very lowly.  compensated or doing everything and they're essential.  I hope people will start to see that shift in their estimation of what's important and what's not. ",
