            "text": "I went to Washington DC this week.  I went as a citizen, as Chris West, the individual.  I'm a Trump supporter.  I don't think that there's any surprise about that.  I think people are very aware of it.  I'm pretty outspoken.  I think it's really important for me to say that that the way that I execute my duties as the sheriff is totally separate and apart from my personal politics as an individual.  I would never let any partisan politics interfere in my obligated and duty to the public or any of my employees.  There's no partisanship.  I started receiving telephone calls, text messages and emails several days ago while I was in Washington DC wanting to know if I was there.  I did not answer those because my wife supported me going to Washington DC, but she asked me not to make that public for her safety.  And I'm concerned even right now making this public statement that me and my wife and my family could be doxxed.  But what I want to say is this.  What happened at the nation's capital, the crimes that were committed, the egregious crimes on our beacon and bastion of last hope for our nation, that's horrible.  I rebuke all of that.  I didn't see that in Washington,  D.C.,  personally.  And the reason I wanted to go to DC is because I wanted to know firsthand, Chris West, private citizen, what happened.  And now that all those horrific things happened, that is taking front and center.  And so I know because I was there about all the wonderful hundreds of thousands of people that came from all across the country.  But I think it's important that I have this, again, there are people that are saying things about me that are erroneous.  And so I wanna put that front and center.  This is a photograph of myself that an individual pulled off of the internet.  This is, I believe it was this.  last summer I went to a news conference that Senator Jim Inhofe had here in Oklahoma City.  I was called and asked by some people in Washington,  D.C.,  if I would go to that press event in support of the senator.  And I went to it, and this was a photograph that came from them.  This was sent to a number of individuals, and it ended up with one of our district court judges who sent it to me.  That's a picture that was taken off the internet of me at Jim Inhofe's news event this summer.  This is it right here.  And this is the picture of the individual that was persons of interest that was put out from Washington, D.C.  And then somebody's added some stuff on here, sedition, treason, and all that other kind of stuff.  And this person is trying to implicate me.  They're saying this is me.  I walked with hundreds of thousands of people from Liberty Square after the president spoke and said, let's walk down to the Capitol.  And so I walked down there amongst hundreds of thousands of people.  Oh, absolutely not.  No, no. ",
