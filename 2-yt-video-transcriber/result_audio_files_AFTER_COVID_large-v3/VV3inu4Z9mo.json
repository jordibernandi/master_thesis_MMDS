And I think we still didn't break even.  Like, I know what's involved in getting all these speakers on a plane and their accommodations and meals.  expenses, the venue, all these other things.  And I feel your pain, my sister in the Lord.  So even those who can't go, I, I would encourage you.  In fact, I'm going to go make a donation myself, see if we can support this sucker.  That's that I think demonstrates the level of love and commitment you have for the cause.  Before I let you go.

It's the Conference on Religious Trauma.  Janice, it's been so good chatting with you.  We'll get the word out and we'll send as many people we can your way.  And, you know, it's an interesting angle.  I've done a ton of free thought events in my 11 years, 10, 11 years as an activist.  This is the first one that has focused specifically on those who have been traumatized by religion.  And, you know, in the happy, clappy world of the faith where they're like, oh, it's all about peace and love and purpose and all those types of things.  And that's partially true, isn't it?
