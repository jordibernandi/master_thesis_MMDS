When a witness starts waking up and they begin to share what they're finding out with someone in the congregation, maybe their husband, their wife, children, whatever, you typically will get two responses, typically.  You'll get the witness who will just simply shut down.  No, this is wrong.  These are lies.  And they'll just go on and on and on and on.  They don't want to hear nothing.  That's the unprofessional Jehovah's Witness.  The professional Jehovah's Witness, the one who is politically correct, what he would do is he would oftentimes acknowledge what you're saying.  Yes, that is true, brother.  Because that's the way it was with me.  When I got ready to talk to people, I literally had no one who said, JT, that's a lie.  That was a lie, JT.  That was a lie.  No, no, no, no, no.  Everyone I talked to was, yes, you know, the brothers, they have oftentimes gone beyond things that they need to go beyond, but that's why we need to wait on Jehovah.  And so all of a sudden, they don't deny that what they're teaching is wrong.  They don't deny that it was never in the Bible.  They simply tell you now, wait on Jehovah.  Go sit down and just wait.  And so this is what happens.  And so as a result, a witness is like, well, maybe I'm not waiting on God.  And as long as he's thinking that he's not waiting on God, then he will stay because he's going to wait on God.  But the moment you realize this ain't got nothing to do with waiting on God.  These guys just know what they was talking about.  They just didn't know what they was talking about.  They made this up.  Once you reach that point in your life, man, you're like, I can't do this no more.  And so you realize it has nothing to do with waiting on Jehovah.  So over the years we've discussed in many videos, what has happened is they got the train rolling.  It came out of the station, now it's going down the hill and they can't stop it.  And they don't wanna stop it because it benefits them so well.  And that's kind of where we kind of stuck.  with this organization.  And so that's why many people are simply looking out the window and they're seeing we're going in the wrong direction down the track.  And for myself and others that you and I know and people we've talked to, they made a decision, I gotta get off this train.  And that's what we did.  We got off the train. ",

You left a Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, a publishing organization.  That's what you left.  And when people begin to understand what they have left, then it has a whole different viewpoint that they will have.  And for some people, they never actually get over that.  And they reach the point where they just feel I am unworthy.  I'm unworthy of even continuing to live.  And that's when we hear about people who end up committing suicide because they actually still believe, even though they've left, that they have left God simply because they disagree with a group of individuals out of the state of New York in the United States.

Now, certainly the individual may have these feelings in their head and their heart, depression and deep thoughts about sadness and escaping.  But what about the Jehovah's Witness organization, the Watchtower, the culture that's created, shunning, character assassination, this fellowshipping.  Is this an intentional strategy to put a witness that's thinking about leaving in that state?  Or is this just kind of accidental culture that's been created over time? ",

People often ask the question, do you think that the Watchtower will ever get rid of the shunning policy, disfellowshipping and disassociation and lighten up as it were?  Like they were many, many years ago.  It was not as crushing as it is today.  Today it is absolutely crushing.  In fact, it's expanding.  When you look at what is happening today where even people who are missing too many meetings, You're not coming to enough meetings.  Now, these individuals have been getting phone calls from family like, are you coming back to the Kingdom Hall?  Regularly, not once a month, but regularly.  Well, if you're not, then I can't have anything to do with you.  So they're actually expanding this entire culture of we will shut you out of any association, any contact with family, and they're allowing the witnesses to do it on an individual basis, which is kind of cool, because then they don't have to take responsibility for it.  They'll simply say, well, that was his mother.  She decided that she didn't want to talk to her son anymore.  But the reason the mother is taking that position is because that's what they've been talking to them about at a lot of their assemblies and meetings and just in general.  this is the new culture.  so it is definitely by intent and it is undoubtedly the most powerful tool that the watchtower has to keep people in control.  the number of people daniel who are literally staying in this religion right now just because this shunning policy is unreal i mean there's some of you are sitting on right now.  they're like If they stop that, should I be out of the mob?  But because of the impact that it will have on them in so many ways, many people, unfortunately, they're staying much longer than they probably intend on staying. ",

Mama, daddy, brother, sister.  So this is what high control groups are, as we all refer to as cults.  This is what they do.  They shut you out.  And it's real painful, Daniel, because, you know, as a Jehovah's Witness, especially if you are an active or you're trying to be a good witness, you literally have very little to do with people outside the organization.  So the organization people are the only people you have, and now you're facing losing those.  And, man, it is painful.  I mean, I tell people, read through the comment sections of not only our videos, but all the videos that you see online.  that are being put on the internet and people will share with you just how painful it is to have to call their parents, their parents pick up the phone, recognize their voice and hang the phone up.

            "text": "Well, that's a very good question.  For the most part, you don't.  And here's the reason why.  The Watchtower teaches that disfellowshipping is a loving arrangement.  And so here you're part of a group that is telling you that treating this person this way is a loving thing.  And when you think about it, Daniel, it's really nothing new.  I mean, throughout the history of religious organizations going all the way back into, you know, years and years ago, the mistreatment of people in the community was considered a loving thing to do.  I mean, that was a time just in this country alone where women had to walk around with a big old A on their chest as they walked around.  But they considered that was a loving thing.  That's loving things, put them in their place.  And so when you're able to teach people that your course of action is a loving thing, then it's understandable.  Even the apostle Paul said, there will come a day where people would offer you up and kill you.  And what would they say?  They said, we did a service to God.  So it's really nothing unusual.  It's really nothing unique.  It's just one of the aspects of what happens when people become involved in a high control group.  The Watchtower literally gave us a value system that is upside down.  When you tell someone that this person's mama don't even talk to him because they don't go to the same church, the average person at your job looks like you're crazy.  Yet if you were to tell it to a witness, do you know what they would be told?  Hang in there, sister.  Hang in there, brother.  You're doing the right thing.  And so we had a value system that was turned upside down.  This is all we knew, and we lived it every day. ",

So this once again drives home the point that we've talked about so many times.  When you start asking critical thinking questions, the teachings of Jehovah's Witnesses, they begin to fall apart.  That is why you can't ask too many questions.  When you have convoluted teachings, it requires that they not be challenged, they not be questioned.  Because the questions that you have raised are excellent questions.  Well, what does it do about a person's sin?  What does it do about a person when you say, I ask all these things through Jesus' name?  It raises those questions.  And if you were to ask a witness, they would simply respond the politically correct way by simply saying, well, Jesus is your mediator in a sense.  And so as a result, now you have a choice as a Jehovah's Witness.  You can keep on pushing it, or you can just go back and be quiet and sit down.
