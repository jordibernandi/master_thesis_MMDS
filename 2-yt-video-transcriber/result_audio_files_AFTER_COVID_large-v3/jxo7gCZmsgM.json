            "text": "Welcome back everybody, and today is a bad day, for I have made a mistake.  Oh no.  Thanks Armin, but you know, I really did mess up.  Why?  Well, I didn't do it on purpose.  Anyway, like any flat earther or creationist would, after realising that they've said something wrong, I am going to correct myself, and I think we should start at the beginning.  Nearly four months ago now, I made this video you can see on screen where I addressed the claims of a certain Dr.  Andy Kaufman.  Today I'm going to be talking to you about Cox Postulates.  He made the claim that viruses do not fulfill Cox Postulates, which were a set of criteria that show that a pathogen is the cause of a disease.  So in other words, he was saying viruses do not cause disease.  Cox Postulates have been fulfilled for viruses many, many times, and I use this one paper as an example.  This paper involved taking five macaque monkeys, injecting them with the SARS virus, watching them get ill, and then isolating the SARS virus from their mucus and faeces.  Cocks.  postulates therefore fulfilled for the SARS virus.  Now that video did really well and the paper in it was something that I'd read from start to finish and I had a really good grip on what had gone on in that paper.  but I started making that video over four months ago and it's been over four months since I'd read that paper and all I kept was the screenshots.  and in that four months my memory faded.  or I misremembered or I don't know what happened.  but I I started making yesterday's video convinced that the paper I'd read was about the COVID-19 virus when of course it wasn't.  It was a paper from 2003.  And then yesterday's video happened.  Well, in yesterday's video, I addressed this tweet made by former world champion snooker player Peter Ebden, in which he asks, does the virus fulfill Cox postulates?  And of course, like a total idiot, I used this paper because I'd simply not looked at it in nearly four months.  And that, of course, was a pretty dumb schoolboy error.  because, of course, even though this paper refutes Dr.  Kaufman's claim that viruses cannot fulfill Cox postulates, it isn't a paper about the virus that's causing COVID-19.  That's dumb.  Dumb.  Dumb.  I know, and I bet you loved it.  Yeah.  Anyway, my dumbness was very kindly pointed out to me in a very polite manner by Goofy on Twitter, which leaves me in the position I'm in now.  And the position I am in now is that I have shown a paper that shows a virus can fulfil Cox postulates when modified for viral disease.  And if you don't know what that term means, make sure you watch yesterday's video.  It's all explained in there.  But what I really need is a paper to show that Cox postulates have been fulfilled by a virus... for COVID-19.  Yes, several people sent me this paper yesterday, and it's dead easy to find on a Google search.  Now, I'll make a more detailed video on this topic, but for now, it's enough to know that this paper does conclusively show that it is a virus that fulfills Cogs postulates for COVID-19.  And to top all that off, let's remind ourselves that not only does it fulfill Cox postulates for COVID-19, but we have also managed to image it under an electron microscope and we've sequenced its entire genome.  So did I make a mistake in yesterday's video?  Yes, of course I did.  I used a paper that was out of date.  I should have been a little bit more on the ball with that.  and look for a fresh up-to-date paper instead of relying on something that I happen to have in a folder on my computer that I'd read four months ago.  That was poor, I will admit that.  But the main points stay the same.  Cox postulates have been fulfilled for COVID-19, for a virus, and Dr Kaufman is still talking a right load of... Now, if you haven't seen yesterday's video, then this video won't be making a lot of sense to you at all.  So I have linked it in the description.  It is long, it is boring, but it does contain an awful lot of good information that will help you when you're speaking to these idiots out there who are spreading misinformation.  For now, I'm going to go.  I'll be back on the Conspiracy Catch channel soon with a normal video.  And I don't like making short little correction videos like this.  So I will make sure I am better researched next time.  See you later. ",
