            "text": "I remember sometime back hearing a very well-known pastor say the Reformation was highly overrated.  That is a shocking statement when you realize that the Reformation was a recovery of the true gospel which had been lost to the entire Roman Catholic Church.  It cost the reformers their churches.  It costs the reformers their reputation.  It costs many of the reformers their lives to affirm the true gospel and to confront the false teaching of Rome.  How can we, 500 years later, be so cavalier in wanting to embrace Roman Catholicism as if there were no difference?  Do we understand that Roman Catholicism has not changed?  Roman Catholic theology has not changed.  It will not change.  It cannot change.  It is exactly today what it was then when it needed to be totally reformed.  but because there's a weakening of doctrinal clarity in the evangelical church, a weakening of doctrinal conviction and courage in the church, and this kind of sentimental feeling that we all need to get together as one.  People are discounting the clear distinction between the true gospel and what Paul tells the Galatians is another gospel.  And Paul says if someone preaches another gospel, let him be accursed.  You need to understand that in this day when there's such pressure to unify with a false gospel. ",
