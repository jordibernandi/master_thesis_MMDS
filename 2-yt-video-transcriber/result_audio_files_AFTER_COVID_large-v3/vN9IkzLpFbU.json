            "text": "Hey, it's Aaron.  This is my show, Re-Education, and welcome back to another episode of my Anarcho-Communism How Does It Work?  series.  Today, we're going to be covering the means of production and seizing them.  So, without any further ado, let's get right into it.  So I hear a lot of communists always talking about the means of production and who should or shouldn't own them.  But I'm not entirely sure what that even means.  What are the means of production?  Who owns them now?  And what are you going to do once you seize them?  Because it kind of sounds like a bunch of violent communists are going to come marching on my home and try to take it away from me.  And if anybody ever tries to do something like that, they got another thing coming.  Now hang on just one second.  I assure you that none of us want to come down and steal away your family home.  That's not what we're talking about when we say the worker control and ownership of the means of production.  We're not talking about seizing people's houses.  We're talking about taking something away called private property.  So, essentially, the means of production would change hands and be classified not as private, owned by an individual or shareholders, not as public, owned by the state, but as common, essentially, ownership by use.  So, a worker at a factory would contribute to that factory through their labor, and that contribution would give them ownership of whatever they produce.  If you produce the sole of a shoe, then you own part of every shoe that your shoe factory creates.  Instead of having an owner, you would all collectively make decisions through democratic means.  You could elect your supervisors and bosses based on their work ethic and abilities, or choose not to have any managers or bosses at all.  the means of production aren't your personal home or your toothbrush, but essentially all of the resources, land, equipment, machinery, labor, and buildings necessary to produce goods in a society.  Currently, the people that own and control all of the land, labor, and resources used. ",
