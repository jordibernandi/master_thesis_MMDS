LeWolt James.  We got to talk about him again, man, because other all-time NBA great players are weighing in on the GOAT debate between LeBron James and Michael Jeffrey Jordan, who I believe is the GOAT.  I don't even think this is really close.  I don't think it's a discussion, okay?  But my favorite NBA player of all time, you guys know I'm a big time Houston Rockets fan, Hakeem Olajuwon.  He has weighed in on the debate between LeBron James and Michael Jordan.  And if you are a LeBron James fan, you're going to be very, very disappointed with what Hakeem Olajuwon said.  And, folks, I always knew that Hakeem would say that Michael Jordan was the GOAT, but his comments made it clear as day that it's not even close.  It's not even close.  So I'm going to read here what he actually said because he actually gave an interview with CNBC talking about this.  And he laid the hammer down, folks.  So this is the quote that Hakeem Olajuwon said about LeBron James when it comes to being the GOAT over Michael Jordan.  He doesn't agree with it.  So he said this, quote, When people start comparing him, LeBron, with Jordan, that's not a fair comparison.  Close quote.  Close quote.  Wow.  So you heard it right there, folks.  Not only did he say that Michael Jordan is a better player, but two times in the same comment, he said he was a far superior player.  That is some strong words right there, man.  And you know, LeBron James, he wants his damn respect.  Hakeem Olajuwon ain't giving you your damn respect when it comes to the GOAT debate.  And that was the only reason why LeBron even said that he wanted his damn respect at the end of the NBA Finals, because he wanted everybody to recognize that he is the GOAT.  And it's not happening.  It's not happening with all-time great players.  Sakeem said no.  Charles Barkley said no.  Even the sports media has said no.  You know, Skip Bayless is saying Michael Jordan.  Stephen A. Smith said no.  LeBron is not the GOAT.  Universally, man, people are not going to acknowledge LeBron James as the GOAT.  And this is true, man.  This is true.  He's not the GOAT.  He's not the GOAT in my book.  I think there is a wide gap between Michael Jordan and LeBron James.  But the major problem with LeBron is, man, he wants people to bend the knee to him in this GOAT debate.  And it's absolutely not going to happen.  Now, if anybody would really kind of know and would be able to weigh in on this, it would be Hakeem Olajuwon.  Hakeem and Michael Jordan, they were drafted in the same draft.  Hakeem went number one in the 1984 NBA draft.  Michael Jordan went number three in the NBA draft to the Bulls.  And we all know who was number two.  We don't even need to really kind of mention that.  That was one of the biggest draft gaffes of all time.  But.  They basically played in the same era.  Actually, they did play in the same era, okay?  And you got to remember that LeBron James went to Hakeem Olajuwon's big man camp to learn how to move in the post.  So Hakeem is very, very familiar with LeBron James' game.  And a lot of players were going into \u2013 taking advice from Hakeem Olajuwon when it came to working in the post because he was probably the greatest post player of all time.  So Hakeem Olajuwon knows LeBron James pretty well, okay?  And, of course, you know he played against the Bulls.  And Hakeem and the Rockets had a lot of success against the Bulls.  It's just unfortunate that they never met in the NBA Finals.  But Hakeem is a two-time champion, two-time defensive player of the year, MVP.  The man knows his stuff about the game of basketball.  He was an all-time great player himself.  And when he says that Jordan is far superior, I 100% agree with him.  I do.  I just didn't expect him to come out and... just laid a hammer down like this, you know, far, far more superior, not once, but twice in the same sentence, you know, and I'm pretty sure a lot of you guys that actually watch our videos, you will agree that LeBron James is no Michael Jordan, you know, only your Shannon Sharps and your Nick writes out there.  They are bending the knee so crazy to LeBron James.  and it just seems very, very over the top, you know, and they really try to diminish Michael Jordan's accomplishments to elevate LeBron James.  but real sports fans of Michael Jordan.  And I like LeBron James as an NBA player.  I really, really do.  My problem with LeBron is off the court and destroying the league, okay?  And I also think you can't beat a goat when you single-handedly destroy your league.  And in 2020, it is clear that LeBron James has destroyed the NBA.  Now, I know I'm talking strictly on the court right now, but in the bigger picture, you cannot beat a goat when your league is going down the toilet.  You just can't.  Michael Jordan, man, the league was at an all time high and at an all time high.  And you know what?  Maybe in like 20 years, even Michael Jordan said this.  that the younger generation will look at LeBron James as being a better player.  You know, because over time, you know, history starts having \u2013 we start having revisionist history on things, you know.  But \u2013 I don't know about that.  I think that LeBron James will always be at least second to Michael Jordan.  I don't think he's ever going to really pass Michael Jordan at all.  I mean, he's still, what, two championships behind Michael Jordan from tying him?  I know that he has been to more NBA finals.  He's been to 10, but he did lose six, okay?  I told you guys I had him number three on my list.  I think that's fair.  I really do.  And I know some of you guys in the comments told me, oh, no, he's not three.  He's like between four and six.  That's not really that big of a difference, okay?  It's really, really not.  But that's just my thoughts on this.  What do you guys think of this?  Hakeem Olajuwon laying a smack down on this.  Michael Jordan versus LeBron James GOAT debate.  He doesn't even think it's a contest.  He thinks it is Michael Jordan in a landslide, and I 100% agree with this.  Anyway, guys, let us know what you think about all this in the comments.  Make sure you subscribe to Black and White Sports, and we'll catch you next time. ",
