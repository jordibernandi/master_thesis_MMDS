            "text": "Hi guys, this is your sister Karen Gidden in Jesus Christ.  Brothers and sisters, I am going to share a very profound, a very powerful, powerful vision concerning it's not my vision.  let me let me i take no credit for this video that's going to play after i have finished speaking to you brothers and sisters i take absolutely no credit no credit at all.  when the person when this beautiful beloved sent me this video i am telling you if i did not know anything anything if i was brand new Sorry to the three days of darkness when I I'm so sorry.  Oh okay all right all right brothers and sisters i'm here now.  sorry about that.  so if i if i did not know anything about the three days of darkness if i was brand new to this thing and this video was sent to me i would definitely have a conviction.  it is powerful.  it is so powerful and it is so I feel like crying because I know a lot of people don't take me serious on the three days of darkness.  But when you listen to this beautiful sister speak, the video is short, it's not long.  But when you listen to the vision that this beautiful sister had, powerful and it's in line with everything i've been saying.  so it's not only me brothers and sisters when i said to you put black bag or whatever over your doors and your windows so nothing can look through.  this sister had the vision about that.  candles being with your family being in prayer in this time.  brothers and sisters this is a serious judgment.  it is a serious one.  the only thing the only thing i don't emphasize on in this three days of darkness is death.  if you go back to all my videos i try to i try to i try to stay away from death.  who's gonna die from?  who's not gonna die?  i personally try to do that.  what this sister?  she talks about it and i know that it's going to happen.  but but my thing is what i want people to be prepared.  that is my because once you're prepared you're safe you know.  but in the book of joshua not joshua but joshua the book that they've taken out that the wicked catholics have taken out of the bible i think it's joshua chapter 81 or 83.  It talks about the extension for three days of darkness.  What exactly happened in Egypt?  A lot of people died.  This is biblical.  A lot of people died in the three days of darkness.  I just don't talk about it.  But I know it's going to happen.  But just refrain.  Because my thing is not to emphasize about death.  I just want people to be... I just want brothers and sisters to prepare.  this video is gonna play.  it is not my video brothers and sisters it is not my video.  um i don't even know the name of this precious sister that did that had the vision but i think she's from um ghana ghana ghana ghana.  i always get those.  it's ghana that one that african country.  okay um Like I said, I don't know her name, but when it was sent to me and I listened, the Holy Spirit said, daughter, share.  And I just had to, it's just going to play after this.  Sister, you know, if you see this video, I am so sorry.  If I knew your name, I would mention you on this channel.

            "text": "A vision that the Lord gave to me, so everyone in this world can hear it.  In this vision, I was having a conversation with someone, but I could not tell who that person was because I could only see a shadow.  He told me that another catastrophe was going to hit the world, and all he wanted me to do was to prepare myself and get my act and things together.  And the way he was talking to me, it's as if he didn't want anyone to hear what he was saying, so it was almost like a whisper.  He was talking in a very quiet tone, and he told me that there was going to be a three-day total darkness in the whole world.  Everything from light to anything you can think about is going to stop working.  We will not be able to tell if the day has ended.  If there's a new day, we cannot tell the day from the night.  Darkness, like never before, is going to strike for three days.  And he told me, to do these things.  One, that I should buy for myself torchlights and candles, something that I can use in the darkness to protect myself and my family.  Two, that I should pray and ask forgiveness for my children, for my husband, and for my entire family.  So the Lord will have mercy on my family in this catastrophe that is about to hit the world.  The third one, that I should pray that before the darkness hits, I will be found in the right place.  that my family and I would be found in the right place.  So I ponder to myself, I'm like, yes, this is true, because if this thing strikes and I find myself and my family all together in the house, then it means that it has caught us in the right place.  But if I find myself outside when the darkness strikes, what am I going to do?  And what are my children going to do?  Then this person that I was talking to agreed with me and said, Aha, that is why I said you need to pray so that this darkness will find you in the right place.  And he told me that the one thing that he's going to emphasize on is that that prayer for forgiveness, we need to really pray.  We have to take it seriously and pray for forgiveness for ourselves, for our family, for our children.  So I asked him when all these things are going to happen.  And he told me that he doesn't even know when all this is going to happen.  But he can tell me for sure that it's not going to be too far fetched.  It's going to be very soon.  And so I need to prepare myself.  And then he told me again that when this darkness dries, nobody will be able to go outside.  It's going to be pitch black, so no one can go outside.  And this is not only going to happen in Ghana.  It's going to affect the whole world.  Nothing is going to work.  TV, radio, maybe our phones are not even going to work.  I don't even know if you have that kind of battery that's going to last you more than three days.  But yes, if you don't have light to charge your phones, then of course your phone is going to die.  So nothing is going to work.  So in that moment, it's only between you, your God, your children, and your family.  And he told me that it won't be long this thing can happen.  He told me that I should warn my family and if I like, I can tell my loved ones.  And he told me that the world as it is now is ruled or it's being overtaken by fake prophets and pastors.  So if you see something and you say it, people do not take you seriously.  So he encouraged me that I should tell the people who are willing to listen and those that will take it seriously, will take it seriously.  He again told me that because of the pitch blackness that's going to overtake the world and because we are not able to go outside, demonic spirits are going to take over.  You can say that as we are confined inside our homes, these demons are going to infiltrate everywhere.  And the coronavirus, the number of people that died, will not be able to compare with the number of people that are going to die when this darkness strikes.  He again told me that these demons are going to impersonate our family members and our friends and loved ones.  Like your mom who's not with you, they're going to impersonate her.  They're going to impersonate your brother or your sister.  And they will talk in their voices, calling out to you to open the door.  And if you hear that call or that voice that sounds like your mom or your sister or your brother, and you have pity on them, can you go open that door?  that demon is going to extract your spirit from you and everyone else that is in that house.  So in that moment, not even one soul that was in that house is going to be alive.  And this person that I could only see the shadow that was talking to me, just kept talking and talking, even though his tone or his voice was soft, it was yet firm, like he was very firm and very serious, saying, telling me these things.  And I could not even ask him any question.  And he told me that if in my house I have windows that I see through, that are transparent, I don't have like thick curtains or blinds that will block out light.  I need to make sure that I seal all those clear, transparent windows.  I need to make sure that it's pitch black so that light cannot penetrate through.  He explained to me that these demons, they can see with their noses, their eyes, and the little spot that they can see through, they would be able to pull your spirit from that window, that little window.  They'll be able to pull your spirit out from it.  So I need to be vigilant and make sure that I close all those little, little spots or the transparent windows.  I need to make sure that I block all that that's going to let light come through.  Then he emphasized again that that prayer of forgiveness, I need to get on it.  I need to pray all the time for forgiveness.  So when this shadow was done talking, it got up and started walking away from me.  But then it turned around and came back to me and told me that I can tell my family members, my friends, my loved ones, anyone that would listen.  And if they don't believe me and they do not prepare themselves towards this impending darkness, three days of total darkness, Then after that three days of total darkness are over, the number of people that will be dead lying on the streets is going to be uncountable.  And those that will be dead in their homes are going to be numerous as well.  Beloved, in fact, what I saw shook me to the core.  And immediately my eyes opened.  I knew I had to share this vision because I did not plan to see that when I slept, and I did not come out to say this on my own.  I did not concord this story to come and say it.  I never dreamt once that a sinner like me, an empty barrel like me, that the Lord was going to use me to reveal such a hidden mystery to the world.  So beloved, I'm in your homes this morning to share this vision with you.  You can also go ahead and share it with your friends, your family, your loved ones, and anyone, so that anyone that would listen and prepare themselves, then salvation will be theirs.  they and their families.  So when you hear this message, please share it with someone that's closer to you or someone that is not even close to you.  Share it so that we all can just prepare ourselves.  Remember that he said we need to always constantly pray about forgiveness.  For forgiveness of sins, we need to always pray that prayer.  And also that we need to buy torchlights, candles, something that you can use in that darkness.  So, beloved, I leave you with this.  I'm not a pastor.  I'm nobody.  But I'm telling you this so that you would also know how to prepare yourself.  Thank you, and may the peace of God be with us all.  Bye. ",
