            "text": "My name is Graham Elwood.  You're watching The Political Vigilante.  Boom, like, share, subscribe.  So what is the corporate media gonna do with the fact that China, Pakistan, Russia, and a bunch of other countries have decided to conduct trade in local currencies and skip the dollars?  This happened about a little over two weeks ago.  This is another thing.  Russia and China have been working to circumvent the United States, trading oil without using the dollar, getting rid of the petrodollar.  They built that pipeline last year.  That's what this is about.  Why are we fighting?  What's all this?  Syria?  Wow, Russia's bad, bad, Russia, Russia, bad, bad.  Because Russia... is allowed to run a pipeline through Syria to get oil to Western Europe, which is a massive oil market.  Syria said no to the United States and Saudi Arabia's oil, right?  So Russia's oil comes from Iran through BAM.  They're buying it from, that's why Iran and Russia and Syria are evil, bad.  But Saudi Arabia that chops up journalists and treats women like dogs, we're cool with that.  They can be as oppressive as they want.  But Syria won't let us have this pipeline.  So that's why Syria's been bad.  That's what this is all about.  Here they go again, trying to protect and pay for their own citizens.  They're circumventing the United States.  I applaud them for doing this.  America's not going to react well.  A roadmap will be finalized and signed at the finance minister's meeting on March 18th.  This did happen.  This story was from the 17th, but I've seen other stories.  This did happen.  This was finalized on the 18th.  Representatives from the finance ministers of central banks of China, India, Russia, Pakistan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan will attend the conference in Moscow.  This is what happens when America just jams its war and its petrodollar down everyone's throat.  This is what has happening.  America is losing its power.  And instead of like, oh, we need to be better, it's doubling down.  That's why we just gave our American banks $4.25 trillion.  This is the real fear.  After a detailed review of these proposals and Moscow's meeting, a system of mutual settlement of national currencies will be introduced for the member countries of the SCO.  So when we started, Obama started sanctioning Russia.  You know what Russia did?  They lost jobs.  People got hurt.  I'm doing a documentary about this.  I interviewed a guy who lost his job in a cargo port.  Good logistics job, good union, whatever job, good paying job.  Now he's driving for a hotel.  So when we put all those sanctions on Russia, do you know what Russia did?  Russia went, okay, we got to make our own products.  We got to grow our own food.  And that's what they did.  One of the things that they started making was medical supplies.  So when COVID-19 happened, now Russia shares a border with China.  They sealed their borders.  They got free healthcare in Russia anyway.  and they make their own medical supplies.  In America, thanks to NAFTA, thanks to the Clintons and the Bushes, NAFTA, our medical supplies, prescriptions, medicines, ventilators, masks, all are coming from China.  because we chipped away manufacturing jobs so that CEOs and billionaires could make more of a profit and American workers got fucked over.  When people are like, oh, these immigrants are taking your jobs, immigrants are not taking your jobs.  Billionaires took your jobs.  A poor person from Mexico or Central America that's coming here to flee terror from drug cartels and sanctions, American sanctions and war, they're not coming, they didn't steal your job.  The Clintons and the Bushes, they stole your jobs.  Trump stole your job.  Obama, they all let it happen.  So when we sanctioned Russia, they actually got stronger internally, and their economy has actually grown.  Life in Russia has gotten better in the last 20 years.  We can't say that in America.  Life is not better in America than it was 20 years ago.  Healthcare costs are through the roof in America.  The number one cause of bankruptcy 20 years ago was not healthcare costs.  We had the housing crash 10 years ago.  We're about to have another one.  because there was a housing bubble, a student debt bubble, a car loan bubble.  All of these bubbles were about to burst, and then this pandemic hit.  And then Congress and the Senate just unilaterally gave $4.25 trillion to banks and gave workers 1,200 bucks, a one-time payment of $1,200, and no freezes on rent, no nothing.  They're circumventing us.  No one wants to be living in America right now during this pandemic.  Did you know that?  People in other countries are like, at least I don't live in America.  Reports say that if the trade and investment between the member states of the SCO begin in national currencies instead of dollars and pounds, it will be a big breakthrough.  It will also strengthen the national currencies of the member countries and promote mutual trade and investment.  Part of America's power has come from keeping people in other countries less powerful, keeping countries developed, keeping countries in the third world, forcing them to use our currency to trade, forcing them to deal with us, forcing them to give us their resources, forcing our companies to build bullshit factories and promise jobs that pay $2 an hour or whatever.  Yeah.  China and Russia are like, nope.  So what's America's response to this going to be?  Yeah, we're gonna blame coronavirus on China, make China and Russia bad guys.  That's why Bernie Sanders is still Russia gay.  Oh, Putin's a bad guy.  Russia stole our elections.  That's what this Russia, Russia, Russia is so bad about for three years, because they saw this coming.  They saw this coming.  They saw this coming.  They knew this was coming.  These countries have been working on this for a while, so we've got to make them the big evil bad guys.  That's why the minute the virus happened, Trump was like, the China virus.  We've got to blame China.  They're eating bats over there, making their weird viruses, killing our good Americans.  No, we need to make them the bad guy.  We need to justify going after them with bioweapons or sanctioning them or attacking them or whatever because they don't want to use our money anymore because we've been such assholes.  Do you see how this is all connected?  You see how this is all connected?  I wouldn't be surprised if they saw this coming and they said, maybe we should release a virus over there.  I wouldn't doubt it.  I did that video.  I just talked about it.  the deadly pathogens getting mysteriously disappearing from a lab, a military lab in Fort Detrick.  Weird.  What's happening?  Oh, we're charging them.  We're trying to blame coronavirus on China.  There's no way anyone in the corporate media is telling this story the way I just did, if they're talking about it at all.  This is why we need to make Russia and China the bad guy.  And this is why when Bernie pushes Russiagate, it's so disappointing.  My friend, Joe Biden, your friend has dementia and is a racist.  We on the left need to mobilize outside of the Democratic Party.  These rent strikes, these general strikes, this are what we have to do because our ruling class is killing us, literally killing us.  And they're doing it because other countries are so fed up with our bullshit.  We could be leading the world.  We could be this benevolent country unifying the world, using this pandemic to unify the world, using this pandemic to go, hey, you don't wanna know a real pandemic?  It's climate change.  Everyone's gonna die.  Coronavirus is not gonna wipe out the human race.  If we did nothing, no measures at all, we would lose, you know, one to two percent of the population, which is awful.  That's if we did nothing.  It still wouldn't kill everybody if we did nothing.  We're doing all these measures, so it's going to be less than that.  It's still going to be bad, but it's not going to kill everybody.  Climate change will kill everybody.  Climate change will end life on planet Earth.  We've mobilized this country, we've mobilized the planet, we could do that and put a green new deal planet wide and America could lead the way.  But it's not gonna happen with Donald Trump for sure.  It's not gonna happen with Joe Biden who's gonna just do, if he becomes president, it's gonna be Mickey Mouse fucking Paris Accord.  jerk off bullshit.  It's going to be a Band-Aid on a shotgun wound.  Nothing's going to happen.  It would happen if we had Bernie Sanders, maybe, but he's not willing to fight.  He doesn't want to fight.  He motivated a lot of us, and I'm grateful for that, but he really doesn't want to call out, he says Russia's an evil empire.  He won't do it.  So it's up to us.  And it starts with these rent strikes.  It starts with these general strikes, these strikes against Amazon.  That's what this is about.  because this is how they're gonna react.  They're gonna sue China and blame coronavirus on China, which is gonna do what?  Make life miserable for Chinese Americans, which is bullshit.  We don't need more racism in this stupid fucking country.  We need to come together.  And it's hard to come together when the ruling class is at every turn trying to fuck anyone they can to get an extra nickel.  Oh, you're dying?  Can I profit off of this guy dying?  Is there a way we can profit off this guy dying?  Can we figure out a way to profit off?  Well, this guy and his family are dying.  Well, then we can make even more money.  Can we profit?  If we make them suffer, can we profit?  People laughing and getting along, I guess they haven't figured out how to make enough of a profit off of that.  Suffering is where they make the money.
