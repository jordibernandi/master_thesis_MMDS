            "text": "Whenever the political laws of the United States are to be discussed, it is with the doctrine of the sovereignty of the people that we must begin.  If there be a country in the world where the doctrine of the sovereignty of the people can be fairly appreciated, where it can be studied in its application to the affairs of society, and where its dangers and its advantages may be foreseen, that country is assuredly America.  So wrote famed French historian Alexis de Tocqueville.  But how did America come to be the preeminent example of the sovereignty of the people?  From whence did the world-changing words and actions of men like Washington, Madison, and Jefferson find their origins?  The answer may surprise you.  Because to a large extent, the foundational ideas behind this unique political experiment can be traced back to two extraordinary thinkers, John Locke and Baron de Montesquieu. ",
