            "text": "It's time to talk about housewives and working women and which category works best for you right after this.  Hello, I'm Nicole Michelle, founder and femininity influencer for the Inner Beauty Movement.  Welcome to all of you joining me for the first time and welcome back to you joining me again.  For those of you who are new, join me on YouTube at Inner Beauty TV by Nicole Michelle.  And you can also find me on Facebook under Traditional Feminine Women United and just about any other platform.  So let's get right into it.  So today I wanted to talk to you ladies regarding housewives and working women and why.  for some women this may be a very touchy subject because they don't know which one they want to be in or maybe they're already doing one of the other and they want to do something else.  right maybe you are a working woman and you have explored becoming a housewife and so you want to see how you can merge into that lifestyle some of your housewives and maybe you are not completely fulfilled.  so you want to get out there into the corporate world and try your footing there.  this video is all about exploring both options.  First, let's explore working women.  There's absolutely nothing wrong with being a working woman.  I think that that's extremely important.  No one can argue that women in the corporate sector and the private sector are needed.  They're needed in legislation, they're needed in very high places in corporations, in government, in medicine, in education, and private businesses.  They are needed.  The feminine perspective, what benefits women is highly important.  And it's very important that women are represented.  So if you're working, don't be discouraged.  We need you.  Keep working.  But there are some women who may be working and going, I'm not getting as fulfilled as I thought I was.  Or maybe I did and maybe I've had enough of working and now I want to do something else.  Or maybe I thought working would be the answer to my fulfillment or I thought this would be my life's dreams.  And maybe I fulfilled everything that I wanted to do.  and now I want to have a family.  A lot of working women started working because that was presented to them.  Going to college, getting a job.  Some women started working because they had no other options.  They wanted to get out into the world and experience the world.  They needed money.  They needed to work.  Some women experience working and liked it and said, hey, this is me.  Some women found their passion as women working in their careers, developing their personality, developing who they are as women, benefiting the world, giving the world their gifts through their careers.  They found fulfillment in that.  I don't think anything's wrong with that.  I think that's awesome.  So let me start by saying that because a lot of women who are working get really sensitive about that.  And we definitely don't want to insult women who are working.  I think as women, the beautiful part of being a woman in the modern day times is that we have the option to go to work or to stay at home with our families.  We can even do both if we know how to balance it correctly.  and manage our time.  And we see the divorce rate has increased drastically because of women finding it increasingly difficult to balance both.  And men are caught in the middle trying to figure out, well, what do I want?  What do I want?  So it's important that if you're a modern woman or a traditional woman to really understand which lifestyle you want because you want to make sure you're making the right match for you.  A lot of women have been working for so long that it's really hard for them to walk away from a job where they've established seniority and tenure and established networking and things like that.  It's hard for them to walk away from that.  So when they hear new ideas and concepts, they go, oh my God, maybe I should have tried something else.  If you are currently working and you're happy, stay on that happy trail.  Don't leave that lifestyle because you hear something new.  I know it's exciting, but if you've set the world on fire in your career, absolutely.  There's nothing wrong with that.  don't walk away and don't make yourself unhappy when you don't need to be.  But if you're watching this and you're a working woman and you go, Hey, you know, I just have a job.  I'm not setting the world on fire.  You know, look, I'm not doing STEM research.  I'm not a physician.  I'm not an educator.  I'm not something where I'm just setting the world on fire.  It's just a job.  I just earned a paycheck.  If you're listening to this and you're going, you know what?  Being a homemaker isn't so bad.  No problem.  So make sure you stay to the end of the video.  So we talk about ways you can merge into the lifestyle that you want.  If you are a woman who desires to be a homemaker on the other end, a shout out to all of you who are homemakers.  I see a couple of channels on YouTube that are absolutely lovely where they are talking about being young mothers and being young stay at home wives.  Maybe they don't have children yet.  I absolutely love it.  I adore it.  I think it's absolutely necessary.  That we have channels that highlight this lifestyle.  It's not so revolutionary.  Um, I was once a housewife.  I'm going to be again.  I think it's great.  I think more women should explore the idea.  A lot of women may not be built for corporate world.  Um, Like they think.  They've just been conditioned that this is what you do.  You go to college, you get a job, you work.  This brings you value, having a job.  And so they just don't see being at home as actually having value.  Being a working woman, you can be single or you can be married.  It doesn't matter.  A working woman is... mostly centered around her job.  She, uh, has a career.  And as a working woman, you don't want to get too bogged down with work.  You want to make sure you leave a lot of personal time for self care, um, and self realignment.  You want to spend some time with yourself where you're just seeing about you.  You don't have any projects.  You're not answering phones.  You're not on any deadlines.  It's just you.  That way you can maintain, uh, connection to your feminine side.  You don't want to get too rough.  You want to keep some of that softness and you also want to be available for self so that you're later available for others.  This will help you attract love, strengthen your bonds with your friends and your family.  and connect to new people and make new friends.  Housewives are underestimated and underappreciated, and we live in a society where it says you don't have any value if you don't have a job.  If you're not clocking in somewhere or answering to some boss at some company, you lack value.  Well, that's totally inaccurate.  If we lay out all of the hats housewives wear, we would be in a 20 minute video.  at least.  Let's lay out some of the duties that housewives have.  Child rearing, homemaking, scheduling, homeschooling, preparing meals, organizing, helping children with their homework, cleaning if necessary if you don't have a cleaning staff, meal preparation, nutrition, participation with the children in their school activities and any other activities they have around the house, sexual availability for your spouse, keeping it spicy, And housewives clearly don't have many off days and they're working around the clock.  If you have a two year old who gets sick at 2am, you're not off duty.  There's no boss you can call that says I'm off today.  I'm not coming in.  We can celebrate women who want to work, but we also celebrate women who want to be housewives because I do believe for society to get better and to strengthen and for so many communities to build and build on their families, we need to have families.  And in order to have those families, we need to encourage women to start looking at the home front more than working.  If you are a working woman and you want to become a housewife, then you want to discuss that with your husband.  Maybe you wanna discuss this with your spouse about maybe reducing your hours, maybe starting an at-home business, working from home.  Maybe your job can become virtual.  These are options that you can absolutely explore.  Maybe there's a niche that you've always wanted to do and maybe this is your opportunity to start that business.  I highly encourage women to do so.  It's not going to be easy.  It's going to take time.  It's going to be tedious.  It's not going to be overnight.  But if this is what you feel is going to give you fulfillment, then do so.  Most husbands are supportive.  if you lay it out how it's going to benefit the entire family.  If he feels like this is going to pull you away from him and the children or pull you away from the home, more than likely he's going to be against it.  So you want to convince him that this is a family thing.  This is going to make you more available and not so stressed out.  Working in corporate world is stressing you out.  You're not physically available.  You're physically sick.  It's not really working out.  And you can kind of pull that back in.  And for some families, it may not be financially feasible for a woman to reduce her hours or to completely walk away from a job.  So that will be something.  her and her husband will have to put their heads together and figure out.  And if you already have children, again, you want to make sure it benefits him and the family.  Let him know this will free up more time for him and the children by you being at home, that you want to be more expressive in your femininity.  You'll be more available to him and the children by being a housewife.  If you're listening to this and you're saying, well, I'm not married yet.  I'm working, but I could easily be a housewife tomorrow if I get married and that's the lifestyle I want.  Great.  Here's the steps you need to take.  One, you need to choose a career that is flexible.  I know that some of you may have a passion for one type of career, but you have to look at the longevity.  Will I have the flexibility to incorporate a family, to integrate a family into that lifestyle?  You want to pick a career that doesn't have such a rigid schedule that will allow you some flexibility.  in case you have children or you wanna travel or spend more time at home, you wanna reduce your hours or work from home.  You want to choose a career that's going to allow you to do that.  For some of you, this is a lot of information to digest.  And so you're trying to really work through it in your mind and try to figure out what works best for you.  But if you're young and you're not married yet, make the decision now whether you want to be in the workforce or if you want to be a stay-at-home wife.  Do you want to be in the workforce until you get married or until you have children or do you want to just be a career woman?  I see so many women who have dedicated so many years to a career that stopping at this point would just not make sense for them.  So ladies, it's best that you make this decision young and go down that path.  That's your strategy.  The next thing I would suggest is learn how to be a wife.  Now there's more to being a wife than being attractive and being sexy and cooking a good meal every now and then.  there's so many moving parts to being a wife.  I, I could do a video that alone, but being a wife takes time.  This is why I created a course marriage prep, uh, to help women, uh, uh, anonymously take the course and learn the things that they need to learn to become a wife and to be a wife.  There's so many duties laid out for women.  It's more than just getting your husband off to work and just having the rest of the day.  There's so much around the house that you need to do that you need to be.  on top of that you end up wearing so many hats.  So I don't want women to think that being a housewife is so easy and that there's hardly any work.  Being a housewife is work.  Number four, you have to find joy in homemaking.  If cleaning and cooking and organizing and sewing and gardening, any of those homemaking activities don't excite you, I can understand why cleaning doesn't, but If one of those activities doesn't excite you all the time or you don't find joy in homemaking, that's probably not the career choice.  You might want to try to balance work at home.  Don't force it on yourself.  Traditional women like doing that stuff.  So if that's not you, you're more modern, then hey, you're just more modern.  That's just who you are.  So don't beat yourself up because you don't like that.  It doesn't mean you're less feminine.  That's not you.  That's not your wheelhouse.  That's not what you want to do.  And that's okay.  And the last one I think is very important is choosing a man that's traditional.  If you're a traditional woman and you choose a modern guy, chances are you're going to have a hard time trying to plan a future with this guy.  if he wants to get married at all he is going to want to be comfortable living together even during the 50 50 not giving you much uh room to be a housewife because he's really going to find comfort in you working.  so that's going to be a difficult choice for you to make but it's important that you don't partner with somebody.  that's making it difficult for you to have that lifestyle.  it just simply means you're not compatible.  you're going to have to move on That's important that traditional women not take that personal.  He's either part of that lifestyle or her.  He's not.  And it's nothing pretty much that you can do about it.  If he's not in the market for a housewife, then you can't change his mind, sweetie.  That's something that he has to be on board with or you can negotiate with him.  But if he's not willing to negotiate and meet you in the middle, then it may be time for you to call it quits or move on.  Shout out to all the homemakers who put their careers on hold so that they can focus on home while their children are small or they are welcoming children into the world.  I think that's commendable and I think that's very brave that they did that.  We live in a society that doesn't really encourage women to do that anymore.  So hats off to all of you and hats off to the women who are in the corporate world, setting it on fire, making the world a better place through their careers.  We need you as well.  Remember, ladies, whatever lifestyle you choose, you still have value.  Whether you decide to be a housewife or whether you decide to be a working woman or you're in the process of becoming one or the other, you still have value.  You want to find the lifestyle that you have fulfillment in and be happy with that.  And don't let others bring you down for choosing one or the other.  Be happy in that.  Get around other women who are going to encourage you.  Follow us, Traditional Feminine Women United on Facebook.
