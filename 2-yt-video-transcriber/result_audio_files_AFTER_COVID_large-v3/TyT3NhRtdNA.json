            "text": "Welcome to the Shikama Live Show with your host, Shikama.  Be sure to engage with the video.  That's what YouTube and the advertisers really want.  Make sure that you have advertising actually turned on so you can actually help me because everything that you do when you don't have ads turned on doesn't count at all.  And it actually hurts because if you watch my stuff and you don't have ads turned on, that means a person with ads has been shut out of actually watching.  my video, and so you're doing a double duty of hurting me twice over.  So just, if you don't have ads turned on, just skip the video.  Just skip my channel and just block the channel completely, because it makes no sense for you to watch anything that I do.  I'm a poor person.  I'm a broke, poor person on every type of government thing that you could ever think of that a man can get.  So no, I don't have welfare or or SNIP or SNAP or BIF or BOF or whatever those programs are.  I have Medicaid.  That's about it.  So interact with the video.  That means click thumbs up, thumbs down, leave a comment, share the video, share the video, share the video.  Let's talk about, oh, and if you want to donate, you donate $50 or so, PayPal or Cash App.  That'll be the first comment that I make.  Let's talk about replacing some women, please.  Twitter is run by super leftists with a bunch of young leftist staff members who assume every young person is like them.  But the truth is, as is the case for most leftist ideology today, they're in the minority.  Not every 18-year-old agrees with the women's studies, black studies, social studies, I don't know about all the studies... So when you get a video clip of a white woman telling an Asian American woman to go back to her country of what, Santa Monica?  Literally, she sounds like she's from Santa Monica, the Asian girl who is actually exercising, doing stretches and exercises, has a nice body.  I don't go for Asians, but she has a nice body.  I can appreciate a woman with a nice body.  Don't get me wrong.  I might not.  bring you home to mom, but I can appreciate you.  I see you over there.  I see you.  We see that the young Asian American woman in question is not, in fact, an SJW, while the white woman in question is.  But hold on, dear viewers.  Feast your eyes on the comment section of the Twitter video clip.  Lo and behold, not a single person there is a leftist liberal.  In fact, they make them fun of leftist liberals.  I don't know what they are, but they make fun of leftist liberals, and they're all young.  I know them.  I mean, not on a personal level, but I know them.  And they call out the white woman for who she really is.  A wascally wasist.  I say it like that to circumvent the YouTube censorship, because YouTube is no longer a platform.  They are a publisher.  And since they censor stuff, that makes them a publisher open for lawsuit.  Welcome to reality.  But I'm going to continue because advertisers also like when you make sure that you self-censor.  But it doesn't stop there.  Tons of clips in this age of phone cameras are now surfacing about all the stuff that's going on.  All of it from January all the way up until now.  of not just police, but of quote-unquote black supporters.  Ladies and gentlemen, I've never gotten any black support.  Never.  I only got Medicaid because literally I was asked to go on quote-unquote Obamacare.  And what did they mean by Obamacare?  They meant Medicaid.  That's what they meant.  Apparently they get something by putting people on Medicaid.  And seeing as I don't make money and I'm self-employed, don't have an employer to give me money, the very next best thing is to put me on Medicaid.  Do I make a lot of use of the Medicaid?  No, for like two years, I had no use for it at all.  They kept reminding me.  It even expired.  And I went to the office and said, well, you used to have You used to have Medicaid.  Why did you go off it?  I said, well, I never, I don't go to the, I don't go to the doctor.  Then my blood pressure shot up to 240.  I was speaking in tongues.  Well, I wasn't really speaking in tongues.  I was speaking in, and I don't know what I was speaking in because I was thinking something, but the words wouldn't come out and it freaked my neighbors all the way out.  They called the police, the 911, the EMT, the governor, everybody.  They said, this guy, either we're going to burn him at the stake or he needs to go to the hospital.  And when they strapped my arm up with the machine and the EMT could not read my pressure.  And then finally he increased the range on his machine because he's thinking, oh, he's got 150 or something.  No, it read 240.  He says, by law, we are going to have to force you to go to the hospital.  It is no longer an option for you not to go.  Strap them up, boys.  And that's what they did.  Five EMTs strapped me into a gurney and away I went.  And I've been going to the doctor ever since.  And that's how I got the flu, the virus.  Let's continue on with our lovely story.  I've never had any black support.  I've never gotten a job.  What do you call it?  I've never... Affirmative action.  I've never gotten a job for affirmative action.  I never got into school, into college with affirmative action.  I never got to law school on affirmative... In fact, law school, my law school had a... a helping program.  so they went to all the black universities down south right black universities and sought out potential talent and if they did not have the uh enough grades or the enough scores on the l set they let them in.  i didn't get that.  in fact when i asked them point blank they said No, and in fact, not only are you not here on Affirmative Action, you got a scholarship for being a genius.  I'm not even joking.  I'm just laughing because I like to laugh.  So no, I've never gotten black support.  I'm kind of offended.  I'm super black.  Oh, I've been fired for being black.  I've been arrested for being black.  I've been stalked for being black in stores.  You know how they stalk you.  I have had all of the other negative connotations that black people face.  And Brian Gumbel said he couldn't get a taxi and he's a millionaire on TV, famous in the entire nation.  Taxi cabs wouldn't stop for him because all they saw was a black man.  He said, it's kind of outrageous.  So when he hears the stories, he said, it doesn't happen to me on a daily basis, but it has happened.  I understand exactly all of these black people.  And let me tell you, I lived a super privileged life.  This doesn't happen to me every day, but it has happened.  I understand.  I don't need a what would you do TV show to tell me what would happen if the people stalked you in the store and said, we know you people, how you people are.  I know exactly what I would do.  And I would tell every black person that has ever happened to, to tell them that you are going to sue.  Don't get angry.  In fact, be as cold and calm as you possibly can.  Threaten to sue.  Let's get a, sorry, I went off on a tangent.  I'm going to stick to my script.  Come on.  So, now, these people say they are black supporters.  But these quote-unquote black supporters, it's coming out through all of these phone video cameras, huh?  That these black supporters are, in fact, extra, super-duper, caliphragic, listic, expialidocious, wascally, wasist themselves.  Oh.  You don't think they are?  Go look up the video.  clicks on Twitter.  Plug your nose because it smells on Twitter.  Plug your nose because it smells on Twitter.  Go ahead and click in there.  Go search for the little black supporters video clips and then type in wascally wasist.  You know what I mean by that.  And the leader of the pack?  White women.  These are the same white women who screech and moan about canceling white male privilege.  Meanwhile, Becky is literally sitting on her white woman throne of privilege to order around the peasants.  She's amassed as a social justice warrior, SJW, or feminist, whatever you want to call it, because they are allies.  That's a key word, allies.  These same Beckys order around the black people.  Because they are allies, too.  They're allies to her.  It's not the other way around.  Don't get it twisted.  Becky sits on her throne of privilege because people are allies to her for being a woman.  Is it becoming clearer?  I'm trying to explain it to you so that everybody in the room can understand.  So Becky, the white woman, sits on her throne of privilege, orders around the black people who they're supposed to be black supporting.  But no, in fact, the black people around her are allies of feminism.  And they're there to serve her needs.  She needs a spiced pumpkin latte, Lamar.  It's so bad how the white man is oppressing you.  Can you make that spiced pumpkin latte snappy?  Chop, chop, Lamar.  Get on it.  Oh, and Jose, can you do my lawn this weekend?  Be a dear.  Do my lawn this weekend.  Okay, Jose.  Because we're all allies.  Meanwhile, I'm having a conversation with my 90-year-old mother.  She's not 90.  I'm just saying that.  I had to explain that because it's a joke and maybe people watching it really think that I have a 90-year-old mother, i.e.  not a grandmother.  And trying to explain to her the concept of toxic masculinity.  To which she replies, so they want men to be women?  How is masculinity toxic?  Explain this to me.  And she kept saying, okay, stop.  I don't want to, I don't know, I don't get into this.  But after 30 minutes of me insisting that she, because this is, I try and tell her about stuff that's going on in the world and she just, she refuses.  But then when something happens that she personally sees or she sees it on Facebook, because she's on Facebook and she is highly offended that Facebook shows very inappropriate stuff.  And I tell you, this is what's going on.  They speak out of one side of their mouth, and then on the other side of their mouth, they're showing you pictures of this, that, and the other.  They claim that they're morally superior to you, but on the other side, they're walking around with their shirt off.  And I have to explain this to my 90-year-old mother.  I'm trying to tell you, Mom, this is the world.  And after 30 minutes, she still didn't get it.  And from a religious standpoint, she really didn't understand it because she's super-duper religious, right?  From her perspective, men are supposed to be men.  And masculinity is male.  It literally is in the word definition.  Why is there a debate?  She kept interrupting me.  It's about the 15-minute mark when she starts saying, this is no excuse for you not to get married.  Leave those types of women alone.  There are plenty sane ones out there.  And that's where we come to the point of this video.  Let me ask you people, can we just replace those women with a fully functioning female hyper-realistic robot?  Yes, for only $345,000, you too can order your super hyper-realistic, fully functioning female robot from Japan.  You have to speak Chinese or Japanese.  Or... Of course.  I was going to surprise you all with... What is it?  It's not South Korea.  It's Indonesia?  So the Japanese are just like the United States, right?  They hire out the... Or they send their jobs to the less... rich countries to do the labor for producing the robots.  I'm sorry I did not get the link for that, and of course I'm relying on my memory, but I wrote the script anyway.  I know some of you are afraid of it.  Some of you are disgusted by the very idea of it.  Some of you question the sanity of anyone buying one.  But I put this entire story of what I just told you at your feet.  You can't question Becky's privilege unless you have something that's 10 times better.  And let me explain that statement to you.  Sure, there's already super hot, super beautiful women out there, right?  But the idea is, and some of the super hot, super beautiful women are actually very available to any Tom, Dick, and Harry.  And I'm not talking about they get around.  I'm talking about they're down to earth and they're not stuck on themselves.  I meet them all the time.  I don't know if it's because I'm super hot and beautiful, but I meet a lot of hot women who are very down to earth, like, hey, how's it going?  Hey, what you up to?  Hey, how you doing?  How you doing, Brian?  How you doing, Steve?  How you doing, Bob?  What's up?  And, you know, all the men are like, what?  Yeah, let's go play some Minecraft.  Let's go play some NBA 2K.  And they're all like, what?  Hold on.  I got my high heel stuck in the gutter grate.  Here.  Pull my hand.  Pull my arm.  Get me out of here.  There you go.  What's up?  Nice shoes.  Nice kicks.  I don't know if they talk like that, but I'm trying to paint a picture.  You have super hot women out there.  Like I said, some are down to earth.  But the idea with a robot, any man can have a super hot ten man.  robot with a purchase of $345,000.  Oh, Becky's will only date men over six feet tall?  Becky doesn't realize only 10% of the worldwide male population is over six feet tall.  And just by going up two more inches to six foot two, it drops to 1% of the entire world.  male population drops to 1%.  And most of those men make so much money that she so much more money than she does that they literally and physically aren't in the same places that she can even afford to hang out.  But Bob, Steve, Brian, they don't have to be rich and they can get a FemBop 9000 for a mere $345,000 payable in installments of $20,000 a year if you act now.  $20,000 a year if you act now.  If we do any upgrades within your buying period of $20,000, $345,000, 5 times 3 is 15.  15 says 17 years.  If there's any upgrades, we'll go ahead and replace that.  your current robot with the upgraded robot at no extra charge.  After the 17 years, though, you'd have to buy a brand new robot.  So let me tell you, let me tell you, I want you to compare purchasing or the money that you spend on girlfriends, wives, all the stuff that comes with a wife, like wife and children, all of those expenses.  I want you to add those up on a year basis, including how much it costs to keep them fed, clothed, housed, electric bill, heating bill, cooling bill, water bill, trash bill.  Add all of that up and you'll see that $20,000 a year is a bargain and for only 17 years.  Some people spend more of that for a car and a car only goes from point A to B. It doesn't do any of that other stuff.  So, I ask you, can we replace the Beckys of the world?  Just the Beckys.  And any other dame that she goes by.  Thank you all for watching.  Give me a thumbs up, baby.  Thumbs up.  Thank you. ",
