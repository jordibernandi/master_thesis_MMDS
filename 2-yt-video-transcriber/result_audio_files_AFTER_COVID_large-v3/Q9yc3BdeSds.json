For example, the red unit that goes all the way across our field of view, that's the Schnebly Hill Formation.  And above that, you can see the first white unit is the Coconino Sandstone.  And above that, you've got the Toorweep, and at the horizon, you've got the Kaibab Limestone, which is the rim rock of the Grand Canyon.  And here we are, 70 more miles from the Grand Canyon, and these layers are still here.  and the scale is what's important.  We're talking about the scale of the sedimentation.  If we have a flash flood, it's only in a very localised area, and we're not gonna get these nice, flat, continuous layers that we see here.  These layers go for mile after mile after mile.  Take the Coconino sandstone.  We can trace it from here, right across New Mexico, Colorado, right over towards Kansas and Oklahoma, even in Texas.  We're talking at least 200,000 square miles for this one rock unit.  that's consistent for mile after mile after mile.  That's not the scale that we see today with localized sedimentation.  And to get it flat lying like this over such a large area, it's like you have to make your pancake all at once very rapidly.  And so these layers show evidence of rapid sedimentation, the extent of these layers.  If we dig deeper into the Grand Canyon, we get at the bottom, we've got the Tapeats Sandstone.  That sandstone can be traced right across North America, up into Canada, across to Greenland.  We see the same sandstone with the same features and the same relative position in the stack of pancake layers across northern Africa all the way to southern Israel.  So that's across one continent and found on another continent at the same level with the same features.  So these layers are very extensive and that requires catastrophic sedimentation on a grand scale.  Nothing like we see today. ",

There's that knife-edge boundary between the Coconino and the Hermit formation, and there's no evidence of erosion there.  which means that the Hermit formation was rapidly deposited, and then immediately the Coconino was deposited on top of it.  But here, we've come 70 miles from the Grand Canyon, and we've got this Snebly Hill formation between the Coconino and the Hermit.  And this Snebly Hill formation, 800 to 1,000 feet thick, over an area of 1,000 square miles, had to have been formed very rapidly.  If that took millions of years, We ought to see evidence of millions of years erosion back in the Grand Canyon at that same boundary.  We don't.  So that means that Schnebler Hill formation in this area had to form in a matter of hours.  So it tells you that not only is there a lack of erosion, but there's no time between those boundaries.  So the whole sequence of layers was very rapidly deposited.  And that's relevant to the time question we were talking about.  If we take modern sedimentation rates, and extrapolate them.  And if we use that in five to 10 million years, we'd have much, much more than 800 to a thousand feet here.  So something doesn't fit either.  The sedimentation had to be far more rapid than modern sedimentation rates, or you had to have erosion off of hundreds and hundreds of feet to trim the Schnebly Hill formation down to what we see here.  And the clue, of course, to resolve this is going back to the Grand Canyon and seeing that there's no evidence of erosion between the Coconino and the Hermit.  So that means there's no evidence of millions of years there.  Therefore, the Schnebly Hill formation here had to form very exceedingly rapidly. ",

At Mount St Helens, we had over a 20-foot layer deposited in just a couple of hours, but the sediment flow within it, the grain sorted out into these laminated layers that were different grain sizes.  We see it here on a much larger scale in the Schnebly Hill Formation.  You can see these bands.  And you can think of that in terms of water currents bringing in the sand grains and settling with different slightly particle sizes over an enormous area very, very rapidly.  There wouldn't have been a lot of time passed between the next surge to bring in the next lot of material.  Back in 1980, there was a hurricane called Hurricane Andrew on the east coast of the United States.  and it deposited a sand layer six inches thick.  Now, within a few years when the geologists went back to examine this layer, the layer had been obliterated.  Why?  Because within weeks and months, critters start burrowing into it.  We call it bioturbation.  They start turning it over.  So that means if there was long time periods for these laminations to form within the large layers, you'd have the critters getting in there and burrowing and turning it all over.  It'll be all messed up.  It wouldn't be nice and neat.  What you saw at Mount St.  Helens was nice and neat because it was rapid.  In one afternoon, in three hours, whoosh, all this material, this one layer, 20 foot thick, was deposited and within it were all these bands.  And that's exactly what you're seeing here. ",

Most people understand a desert with a sand dune and the wind blowing the sand forward.  Well, underwater, we see the same thing, sand waves.  And so the water current is rapidly moving it along.  and what we get left behind are these front-facing slopes.  And we can estimate the depth of water, the speed of the water current, and we can do this with a Coconino sandstone.  In actual fact, it's important to recognise that there's a difference in the angle.  in a desert dune, it's usually 30 to 34 degrees, of these sloping beds.

So there is a physical sequence of rock layers, just like we see here.  Now, sometimes there's layers missing in one area that are found in another area, but we can build up this concept of all this sequence of layers into the geologic column by piecing together the details from around the world.  Here in the United States, we've actually found If we got all the local geologic columns from drill holes and from observations, so that's real physical layers, and then match them from area to area around the United States, we actually can break down the geologic column, that section that contains all the fossils, into six major sequences of rock layers called mega sequences.  This has been known for over five decades.  We can trace them right across the continent as if there was a sediment rush surge that laid down these layers.  And it's interesting within each mega sequence, you actually go from a coarse layer.  at the bottom In the Grand Canyon, you saw the Tapeats Sandstone.  Sitting on top of that is the Bright Angel Shale.  Sitting on top of that is the Muave Limestone.  So the grain sizes get finer as you go up.  And that's a recurring feature of these mega-sequences.  And the best way to explain it is with the flood paradigm, not millions of years.  And so we see that.  There's a real sequence of rock layers that we find around the world.  So it's not at the figment of the imagination.  In fact, if we go back in history, If we go back over 200 years ago, it was actually geologists who believed in the flood paradigm that established some of the terminology found in the geologic column.  They used to call the lower layers primitive, that went back to the original primordial creation.  Then they had the secondary, which marked the beginning of the flood, which is these layers that we see here.  And then they had the tertiary.  which were the layers that were formed at the end of the flood and into the post-flood period and finished with a quaternary, four subdivisions.  Now, some of those names have been changed, but they were originally established by geologists who believed in the flood. ",

            "text": "So there's no contriving about this.  It was originally established on the flood paradigm.  But then there were geologists like Murchison and Sedgwick and Lyell who started to subdivide some of these layers and add in millions of years and give them names, like the Cambrian from Wales and Ordovician from a Welsh tribe.  And so they started to give these names to the layers.  Those labels do mean a particular package or group of layers, but they don't necessarily mean millions of years.  The issue of establishing millions of years is a separate question that we've been dealing with.  We've talked about the radioisotopes, we've talked about the extent of these layers and all those other evidences in the geologic record indicate that they weren't the millions of years.  This is because there's a clash of views of Earth history.  Those who want to have the conventional view of millions of years versus those of us who say no, most of these layers form rapidly within the year of the flood. ",
