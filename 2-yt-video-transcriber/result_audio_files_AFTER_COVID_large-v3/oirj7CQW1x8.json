            "text": "Shalom.  I'm Messianic Rabbi Zeb Porat and thank you for joining me.  We're living in prophetic and exciting times.  There's never been a generation closer than this generation to the second coming of Jesus Yeshua.  We're not setting any dates, but we know that the time is near.  We know that the veil is being lifted, 2 Corinthians 3, verse 16, and Jews and Arabs are being saved like never before.  In the midst of the COVID-19 panic, in the midst of people losing their mind, just yesterday on the news, we read here in Israel that several people were quarantined and they were put in Israeli hotels to be quarantined for 14 days.  and because the room was small and because they felt that they were locked in a prison, they actually tried to commit suicide and were taken to the hospital for that reason.  Other people refused to get medical attention that had nothing to do with the COVID-19 because of the panic.  So there are more people here in Israel that are possibly dying or wanting to commit suicide because of this COVID-19.  It's all demonic.  We know this.  We understand this.  Now, I'm not saying that the COVID-19 is not dangerous.  I'm not saying that we should not take care of ourselves.  I'm saying that we, as believers in Yeshua and Jesus, we know where we came from and we know where we're going.  And greater is he in us than the one in the world.  So what we're doing here in Israel is sharing the full gospel of Jesus Yeshua, comforting the people with the love of Yeshua HaMashiach, with Jesus.  Isaiah chapter 40 verse 1, Comfort my people, says your God, as we are all called to be ambassadors for the kingdom, all called to be priests and share the love and the testimony of Yeshua Jesus.  For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and love and of a sound mind.  If we have a sound mind and we are in the word of God, we will not only be able to overcome the fears of this world, but we'll be able to be a testimony and comfort those who don't know Yeshua Jesus.  Yes, we live in a fallen world, but we live in kingdom mentality because Jesus Yeshua lives inside of us and we will continue to rejoice and preach the gospel.  The coronavirus will pass, but one thing will not pass, and that's the word of God and the kingdom of God, the new heavens, new earth, new Jerusalem.  We look forward till that day and rejoice.  We here in Israel at Messiah of Israel Ministries are praying for all our brothers and sisters in America and around the world, as we know that you're continuing to pray for us as we continue to preach the gospel here in Israel.  Thank you.  Psalms 122, verse 6.  Pray for the peace of Jerusalem.  They shall prosper.  that love thee.  God wants us to stand together in prayer and in worship.  When Satan was a cherub before the fall, he was a worship leader.  For this reason, Satan hates worship.  When we worship, it drives Satan and his demons crazy.  We will continue to worship together as the one new man in the midst of the world panic.  Psalms 117 verse 1 says, People like to ask, what should we do in the midst of the crisis in the world, in the midst of the coronavirus?  Keep on praying, keep on preaching, and keep on rejoicing.  Because all those under the blood of the Lamb shall be saved for eternity.  Rejoice, all you nations.  And this is what we're doing here in Israel.  Join us as we worship the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, Jesus Yeshua.  To Him be the glory. ",
