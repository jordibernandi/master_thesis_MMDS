Do you see the absurdity of this scenario?  The amount of evidence that supports the argument that this whole thing is by design is overwhelming and more scientific than the argument presented by the governments and so-called experts.  If you want to see some of this, please watch the previous episodes, which predicted week by week what will happen.  Three months in, we have not got one thing wrong to date.  Not because we are great at predicting, but rather because their script is so bad.  All you have to do is read modern history and you will see the same pattern.  This time they have technology hostage, and that has always been the last piece in the puzzle to gain total control.  Initially, this episode was supposed to be about masks, to provide some evidence of their ineffectiveness, and to show that they are nothing but a constant physical reminder of a threat and part of brutal psychological warfare.  However, I change my mind as I feel that they have us chasing our tails.  Do masks work?  Will we need gloves?  Is it now in cats?  My friends, they are just buying time, and every day that passes they are implementing new laws to enslave you under the disguise of protecting you from a killer virus.  This is only the beginning.  The next five years will be a constant attack on our lives.  What will drag us down and help them unknowingly is the conforming fearful 90% of the masses.  This is why the first step to combat this is to wake the majority up.  The only advantage we have over the generations before us is that we are better connected globally, so we can piece together the puzzle better now.  Our last hope of being connected is now under attack more than ever.  I am sure if you have been researching what is happening now, you already know. ",

We have been constantly banned and chased out of every platform for no good reason, because we simply question the mainstream narrative.  As The Mirror Project, we would have liked to have launched our platform by now.  However, the extreme censorship and harassment we have been experiencing has made it extremely difficult to get heard and sponsor the launch.  We want you to know that we are working on it and figuring out ways to get around all the challenges and speed up the launch.  So if you believe in the same cause, help us get the word out. ",
