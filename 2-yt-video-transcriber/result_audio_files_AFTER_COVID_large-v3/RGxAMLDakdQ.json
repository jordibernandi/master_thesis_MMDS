            "text": "Hi there, it's your girl Z from transvoicelessons.com and in this video I'm going to showcase 25 different voices.  First, I'll start with my average voice.  So this is my average voice.  This is what I sound like if I'm not really, you know, doing anything fancy or whatever.  It's a pretty average voice for me.  I am warmed up today since I recorded the clips before this and stuff like that.  So I kind of have different forms of my voice.  So like, you know, sometimes I'll be like more here or whatever.  And sometimes I'll like come down here if I'm like really, really dark or feeling androgynous or whatever.  Of course, and I also like to operate here sometimes.  And of course, my teaching voice is more like this.  So when I'm like, okay, look, you've got to understand that this thing relates to this thing and this thing goes there.  So those are my average voices that I typically utilize.  Part, purr, heat from fire, fire from heat.  Part, heat from fire, part, purr, push, port, pool.  Never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever.  per, part, port, pot, pool, pew, put, purr, push, never, ever, heat, pit, part, pot, port, pool, pew, put, purr, push.  Nah, I mean, like, if I'm, like, talking in a voice like this or whatever, like, normally that's, like, not, like, super, you know, desirable or whatever, but it is a valid vocal quality and this is definitely more feminine than average.  Um, okay, so, yeah, here I am with, like, a voice like this.  Like, I like this as, like, a really, like, pumped up kind of film sound, you know, where it's, like, my lips are barely even moving.  They're, like, pushed out a little bit.  It creates this warmth, and, I mean, you can do, like, a lot of different stuff with that.  Like, um, so, this is fun.  How dare you do that kind of thing, Harold!  Get your butt over here, Harold!  Get your butt over here!  I can't believe you do that in this house!  I've raised you better! ",

Scottish accent can differ so drastically.  It's a stone's throw away here.  So if I'm over here, it's just a little bit over that way.  So it's not a big deal or anything like that.  Okay, so one of the things that the falsetto does have going for us is it allows us to get like, it allows us to do, I can just like bridge that back down here or whatever, right?  So, and I'm in falsetto the entire time here.  This is like a much more difficult kind of sound.  This is like a falsetto that's like a little bit more like tamed, you know?  So this is like probably a more passable falsetto, but yeah, I'm definitely in my falsetto here.  I'm not using my modal voice.  Um, okay, so, like, everybody always says, like, don't speak in falsetto or whatever, and this is why it's- Here is an androgynous, bimodal voice where we produce multiple fundamentals at the same time.

This is much more of like a cyborg quality, right, so I'm trying to make my- now it's gonna be even more confusing because I've got a really high R2, but I'm trying to make my R1 bigger while I keep up the same degree of glottal behavior.  If I take it down here, then what you end up with is like another kind of, wow, I've changed the bitonal relationship in my voice.  I'm not sure how people would gender this kind of voice, so I'm going to present this as a kind of degree of neutral androgyny.  So if you think that this voice is androgynous, let me know. ",

Uh, it's one of those things where, you know, you kind of just get, you know, one way or the other, but, like, it just seems like, um, uh, it just seems like it's, like, like, there's more, like, false fold in, like, a lot of those voices.  Um, it's just, like, uh, it's chill, you know?  It's chill.  Yeah.  No, no, you're- God, really?  I cannot believe that.  That is honestly so atrocious.  I can't even believe that that was like a combination, you know?  So yeah, it's going to be one of those days.  There's like a lot of this kind of digging in on the sound, right?  And it's just one of those things where you kind of want to like emphasize certain things, but at the same time, you want to like drive away from them too.  I refuse to go there.  If you plan to go there, I will not go there.  I drew my lines here when I came onto your ship.  So this kind of voice basically is when you have an asymmetric closer control over.  So it's a little bit noisier, but it's a really cool sound still nonetheless.  Here's definitely a different speaking quality than what I normally utilize.  This is more of like a, there's a two-point constriction.  I've got up constriction lower, and I've got a constriction forward. ",
