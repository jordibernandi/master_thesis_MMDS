            "text": "As we see the First Lady and the President start heading over so he can deliver his State of the Union speech, we're going to go over there early while they're en route, and we're going to have a look at some of the pre-speech interactions and conversations.  As the politicians stream in for the State of the Union speech, We'll see them greeting each other with general formalities.  The one thing to notice here as Old Dirty Mittens is entering is over to the right, you'll see some guy leap out to get Mitt's attention.  The reason I'm pointing that out is that we're gonna come back to this guy a little bit later.  But let's hurry up and get away from him and we're gonna go bounce around the room and listen in on some random conversations.  It was well worth it.  When we work out our differences, we have before everything.  Yeah, I hope Sue caves this Tuesday and that he worries.  It's at this time that the camera cuts to Nancy Pelosi and Mike Pence, but we can replay this again.  And then this time I'm going to show you this lady down on the right, her response to Adam Schiff's statement.  Yeah, mmm.  I hope Sue caves this Tuesday and that he worries.  We can watch the whole thing now knowing what they say.  Yeah, mmm.  I hope Sue caves this Tuesday and that he worries.  I wish that camera hadn't cut so we could see what else Schiff was saying.  The camera cuts to this lady who I noticed stood up and clapped often during Trump's State of the Union speech.  But it's interesting what she's saying to her friends during her various conversations before Trump speaks.  It actually perfectly explains why she didn't draw the angry looks and pointing from Nancy Pelosi as she often stood alone clapping for Trump.  Here's what she says.  I wonder if it sticks.  We'll see tomorrow.  They can't impeach him.  It's just now the history was made, so I knew it was worth it.  I just wish it wasn't like this.  I just wish it wasn't like this.  I get it, but... And it was me and Natalie that had to fix this.  So I said... If we drop into another one of her conversations, we learn a little bit more.  Stop the earth!  But we're supposed to stage you at this time.  But you were right.  But you weren't supposed to let them vote.  So who's going to lose track over it?  I can't stop their votes, but you can switch them.  I can see that happen.  I think we'll look at that.  That's a crisis.  You know, I had thought of something.  Remember at first when I had faxed you a letter saying... Darn those camera cuts.  But we can go back over to the conversation where Cinema is and look at Adam Schiff's conversation.  Let's say that we're me.  I would just say what we have to ensure right now, remember it was him and we let it go.  You know you're in for a good time when you join the corner where Ilhan is hanging.  So I just have to say, as soon as we impeach, we should have somebody go over there.  Yeah.  While Nancy continues thinking that she lost stuff, I just remembered I need to take you back over by cinema.  There's another conversation I want to share with you.  He's adventurous.  He is impeached and that advertisement was something that was worth it.  So yes.  And I'm assuming whoever saw impeachment were so upset afterwards we may need a whip cincher.  But we're going to do what it takes to finish it.  Whatever it takes.  Thank them for me, too.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Oh, I see.  There he is.  There's the feed.  Down in front of the stage we see a small gathering of press and I think that that's what Pence and Pelosi keep looking at to check if they're recording.  But perhaps they don't realize that farther back in the room there is a camera right on them.  There's the feed!  For a second at least.  Bewildered, we see her look straight at the camera that has been recording them the entire time.  But I guess she doesn't think that it's close enough or something.  So they continue their conversations.  Maybe it was the top.  One of them.  Up top.  I guess it probably is time for the press.  As we'll see in the conversations from these two, they are unusually focused on those camera feeds.  And given the things that they're talking about, it makes sense.  Now, did you review your papers?  I'll figure it out.  Half are for him.  You split that.  456.  456.  456.  No, you have to see that you have them in case it happens.  I think that half's okay.  Okay.  And let's say even if that does, and it was your paperwork that you were forgetting, it could happen so fast.  we would be forbidden next time.  It's messed up.  Yep.  We're gonna do good.  Well then I hope for the best to see everyone's testimony.  So do I. Hoping so.  Including you.  We're not out of the woods yet.  So far.  Well, you'll definitely know it.  Remember why it's down to half for you, half for him.  Oh, you're right.  Yes.  Oh, that's right.  That's right.  We never wanted a coup d'etat for you.  Are you sure it's not on?  Fox News at 11.  If it happened to see you.  I heard that Susan's not ready to impeach him.  Yeah, and, um, I heard that Susan wants out of the Centurion.  Okay, so back to Swallswell.  Here we see him interacting and remember how he jumped out to say hi to Mittens.  Watch Rand Paul as he approaches and watch Swallswell's reaction.  Now he wouldn't be signaling Nancy Pelosi or Mike Pence, would he?  Let's see that again.  This little guy tells Swallswell about Rand Paul.  That's when we see Swallswell signaling, then he avoids Rand Paul.  I do wonder who and what he was signaling.  Now make a mental note of that little guy.  Ramen Noodles looks like she's having a blast.  Yes, I would.  I'd shoot him right here.  I would.  On the bottom right of the screen, we see Little Guy talking to Sheila Jackson Lee right as Lisa Markowski is entering.  Make or break votes like Lisa's have the halls buzzing.  As soon as Little Guy tells Sheila that Lisa is there, watch what Sheila says.  now did you catch that?  because i can't really say it but i'm sure you can lip read this one all right.  now there are those like sheila who are not happy and then there are others who are very hopeful.  this guy is amazed that it could come down to two people.  two people.  this is amazing.  Well, I just don't know what to say about both of them.  So, once he wins, they'll just have to go.  There's no double dealing.  when Ted Cruz enters.  He makes it very clear exactly where he stands.  Just so you know, some people are for exonerating him faster.  Well, I'll be going to bat for him.  Just so you know, some people are for exonerating him faster.  Well, I'll be going to bat for him.  That's good.  Speaking of the Supreme Court.  Madam Speaker, the Chief Justice and Associate Justices of the Supreme Court.  Nancy's caught on a hot mic after the introduction of the Supreme Court and their associates, minus Ruth.  Still in the cleaners.  Still in the cleaners.  Since the microphone only caught half of what she said, I was able to decode the rest.  and here's what she says.  I'm still replacing half of them.  Pence and Pelosi, as hard as they tried, just couldn't seem to figure out when the feed was live.  So they went on talking anyway.  In this next part, watch how often and intently they stare to see if the news feeds are on.  Their little friend off to the left is even helping them to know, but they just can't figure it out.  You would expect them to be on now, Feisty.  say so.  I highly recommend re-watching the so too and you'll observe.  these two go between awkward moments when they're not sure if the feeds are on, to poison fake smiles when they think that they're on, back to their questionable exchanges when they mistakenly think that they're off.  I'm always nervous that they're watching so let us know as soon as those lights turn to red.  So down on the left, their helper is there and he is desperately trying to see if the camera feeds are on for them.  So we'll see him kind of pop in and out of the screen, but that's what he's doing and they are waiting to find out if the feeds are on them.  I don't think they're on.  I know I was worried if that would happen at first.  so you always have to make a remedy and this is sort of the house is the first test.  We have to have a sure win.  I'm woke.  Finally there's hope.  U.S.A.,  U.S.A.,  U.S.A Madam Speaker, the President of the United States, Be sure to follow me on Twitter at I double underscore love underscore Trump. ",
