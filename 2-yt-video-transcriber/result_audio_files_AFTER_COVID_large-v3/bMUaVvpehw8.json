And may I say to the United States president, Mr.  Trump, please blow your trumpet.  Blow your trumpet in a musical way towards the values of unity, peace, cooperation, togetherness, dialogue, damnation.  we shall always resist, no matter whence it comes.  We have resisted it when it was in the form of imperialism, as we fought for our own independence, our own culture, to be masters of our own destiny.  That's why we call ourselves free today.  It is because the monster of imperialism was defeated by us.  bring us another most monster by whatever name he will suffer the same consequences.  i'm a king.  yes i'm a king.  i'm a king. ",
