He was a member of the House of Commons and the House of Lords for 37 years, a lawyer, attorney general, and a member of the Privy Council, the group which advises the monarch.  He died of pneumonia after carrying out experiments with ice in 1626.  He was incredibly popular in his day.  Voltaire praised him.  His influence on the Enlightenment was considerable.  Thomas Jefferson commissioned portraits of Newton, Locke, and Bacon.  He was fascinated by the scientific discoveries of his day.  The printing press, the compass, gunpowder, and so on. ",

He thought that the scholastic philosophy taught at the time was dry, closed off, esoteric, at a dead end.  But before we look at his philosophy, it's important to understand Bacon's motivations.  Bacon was, remember, an establishment figure and a lawyer.  And before he became more interested in science and philosophy, he was interested in the law.  He wanted to reform the legal system of England.  He wanted to systematise it so that its truths could be more easily discovered and interpreted.  He thought there was an underlying structure to the legal system that could be simplified.  In other words, he was interested in consolidating and structuring the discovery of truth within an institution. ",

He references the names of things that don't exist, referring to fiction or concepts in philosophy, while also pointing to how language is vague and words ill-defined.  Adjectives like rare, bright or heavy refer to degrees and aren't specific enough.

We might say heat is caused by brightness, as the sun, fire, and light seem to cause heat.  And so, by syllogism, we can say that heat is caused by brightness, therefore the moon is hot at night.

And he writes that, for the form of a nature is such that if it is there, the given nature inevitably follows.  Okay, so instead of starting from general axioms and ideas when searching for the causes of those forms, Bacon says a new beginning has to be made from the lowest foundations.
