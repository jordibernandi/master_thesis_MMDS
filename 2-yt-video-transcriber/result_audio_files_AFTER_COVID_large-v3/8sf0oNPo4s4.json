            "text": "This last few days, a very influential saint went to heaven.  His name was Jim Packer, J.I.  Packer.  I was first impacted by J.I.  Packer back in 1973 when his book, Knowing God, fell into my hands.  It was powerful, and it influenced Christian people all across the country and around the world.  A second book, Evangelism and the Sovereignty of God, also had a massive impact on my life.  In 1978 I had the privilege of serving on the International Council for Biblical Inerrancy.  There were only two pastors out of a hundred.  There were 100 scholars, 98 from educational institutions, and two pastors, myself and the precious Jim Boyce.  J.I.  Packer was on that council as well, fighting for the inerrancy of Scripture.  It was 1994 that I had a personal connection with Jim Packer.  I sat beside him for seven hours.  down in Florida as six of us worked to clarify the gospel.  There was Bill Bright and Chuck Colson and Jim Packer, and on the other side of the table there was Jim Kennedy, myself, and my dear friend R.C.  Sproul.  For seven hours we went at it over the gospel.  And this was a remarkable group of men.  Jim Packer died at the age of 93.  Jim Packer understood what was going on in the church, even at his age. ",
