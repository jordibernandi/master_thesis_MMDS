I mean, if you've got this sort of moral commandment about doing justice and protecting the vulnerable, and the dignity of every person that can't be limited to sort of i don't know church fates or sort of flower arranging classes.  it's got to be out there in the wider sphere and the bible you know is that that was the role of religion in earlier times and your prophets, your Amos and Isaiah, were always protesting against political corruption or business malpractices or neglect of human rights.  The only limit I would put on this is that I think clergy can speak out about political issues, such as, I know, homelessness or food banks or arms trade, but not party politics.  In other words, we shouldn't sort of push a particular manifesto from the pulpit.  Now, I'm not saying that religion can speak more than anybody else.  We're not privileged, but nor should we be gagged either.  And frankly, if a minister isn't prepared to talk about values outside of the church or synagogue walls, then he shouldn't be in the pulpit in the first place. ",

And if we were to say that, then that means that any big business, religious business or not, should have more influence in politics.  And I think that it's absolutely fine and right for the church to express an opinion on something like food banks that it's involved with, and even actually the intention of the government to break international law, because that's a very general moral issue.  But it goes much further than that.  The Archbishop's letter is actually commenting on issues of trade and devolution.  And of course, the previous speaker said that The religious voice doesn't have privilege.  Of course it has privilege.  We have 26 automatic places in the House of Lords reserved for Church of England bishops.  No other religious group and no other groups at all get that ring-fenced allocation in the House of Lords.  And there are only two countries in the world where there are religious clerics with automatic seats in a parliament, and that is Iran and the UK.  This is really, really anachronistic.  It's positively medieval.  We're a pluralistic society.  Why does one religion have that political privilege in the UK? ",

And to summarize in the word of previous Archbishop Rowan Williams, he said it would lead to constitutional unscrambling.  But for all reasons and purposes, we are a secular state, but with a strong Christian cultural ethos.  with an active secular multi-faith and multicultural society.  However, the church is present in every single community across the country.  So the special status is not simply a privilege, rather a moral responsibility to represent all faith communities and none in the political sphere.  The reform of our political institutions is essential.  Until then, the church functions as a symbolic space, which kind of brings all other different faith communities to share and to offer a constructive space. ",

They've been behind society on so many issues, on the equality of women, on allowing divorced people to get remarried.  And just a terrible example, this month, the report of the inquiry on child sexual abuse has shown appalling cover-ups, even a couple of bishops themselves being serial abusers and many others turning a blind eye.  So the idea that they're giving a moral lead, I think, is now just false.  And sadly, I'm an Anglican and I used to be in favour of establishment, but I think it's an entitlement that they haven't earned anymore.  They've lost that privilege.

I mean, certainly there are some very ultra-Orthodox groups on all faiths which are moral laggards, but there are other religious groups, the Reform or the Liberals, for instance, who have been at the forefront of anti-slavery or gay rights, And as for the bishops being privileged in the House of Lords, well, 26 bishops may sound a lot, but actually it's only 3% of the total number of people sitting there.  And the number of people attending church synagogue mosque every weekend is is much more than that.  now i agree that we can do some tweaks here and there and that for instance um some of those bishops maybe we can only have 15 and we can have some rabbis and imams in the lords instead.  and certainly the next coronation whenever that is should have multi-faith representation.  but it's actually quite good having the church as an established uh faith partly because it reflects the history and culture of this country although we're now multi-faith and multi-religious, partly because it's actually quite useful having some moral backbone to the country.  And of course you can be ethical without being religious, but it does help.  And also, to be honest, the Church of England has had a light touch.  It's really encouraged other faiths.  It's been in the forefront of mixed-faith dialogue.  Actually, it's also stood up to government.  It hasn't been in cahoots.  I mean, think of it criticising it over Brexit or over food banks or even the Archbishop of Canterbury taking Margaret Thatcher to task for going to war over the Falklands.  So very often it's actually been a moral barometer.  Alice. ",

And then that's disregarding the more than half of the population that is not religious.  And of course, those of us that are not religious have moral and ethical bases to our philosophies.  I mean, I think this argument, which has already been deconstructed, that the The church is a moral leader.  It just doesn't stand up.  And I think if you look at history, if you are using that kind of historical argument and saying, well, historically, the Church of England has been important.  If you also look at history, you see a trend over the last five or six centuries in Europe.  You see a trend towards.  A movement of power from monarchy to parliament and a movement of power away from religion as well to parliament.  So the separation of church and state, which has happened in, you know, is written into other countries' constitutions and just hasn't happened in England.  And of course, Wales is way ahead of us.  It disestablished its church more than 100 years ago.  So I think the disestablishment of the church is something that will happen.  In this half of the 21st century, it's just when it happens. ",

I think just as you in this very programme, just a moment ago, we saw Pope Francis talking about and instigating a whole new conversation and you had someone come and speak about it.  The church, I think, being politically active and standing up for social justice is the essence.  and speaking for the most vulnerable in our midst is the very character of the church.  I don't disagree with Professor Linda Woodhead, but the fact is that the church is not claiming to have a moral lead, but rather they have been silently doing excellent work, particularly in the last seven months.  The majority of the food banks are supported by the churches.  Institutionally, yes, we are morally corrupt, but at the same time, as a presence in every community, I think the churches have done excellent work.  And I'm a trustee of a church. ",
