The fact that Christians hate the sin rather than the sinner is an implicit indication that many of the edicts of Christianity are immoral.  It's a subtle form of cognitive dissonance.

He's saying that if you're convinced that gays choose to be sexually attracted to the same sex, then it follows that you could choose, right now, to be gay.  which you can't.  The extended implication here, at least as I see it, is that given that one doesn't choose to be gay, only a repugnantly evil God would create his children irreversibly sick and then command them to be well on threat of them being forever barred from heaven, or as Paul puts it, the kingdom of God.
