            "text": "So the next article I wanted to take a look at is entitled, Pat Robertson Says Biden Will Be President.  It's Time for Trump to Move On.  This is by Hemant Mehta on the Friendly Atheist website.  So let's give it a read and see what it has to say.  If Pat Robertson is a voice of reason, you know we're living in scary times.  Today on The 700 Club, Robertson said the election was over, Joe Biden was going to be the next president, and Donald Trump needed to move on.  That is a big fucking deal, actually.  The fact that Pat Robertson, one of the leaders of the evangelical movement, is now backing Biden.  That's a big deal.  If you guys remember a while back, Pat Robertson actually freaked out about Trump losing.  He had this on-air freakout, and I talked about it on my main channel at the time.  But I guess he's kind of come to his senses, taken a breather, calmed down a little bit, and reanalyzed the situation and decided that Trump is doing more damage than it's worth backing.  So let's take a look at the actual video from Pat Robertson and see what he had to say. ",

            "text": "Okay, I'm not sure what that has to do with anything, why he even mentioned that.  Biden is old, but he's not that much older than anybody else who is in the running.  How old is Trump?  Isn't he like in his late 70s or something?  Biden's like 78.  What's the age difference?  Let's find out.  As old Steve would say from American Dad, no need to wonder.  Just loaded up our question gun.  Let's go answer hunting.  So it says here Biden is 78 years old.  He was born November 20th.  So he just turned 78, like last month, basically.  And Trump is 74 years old.  He turned 74 June 14th.  So roughly four year difference, basically, I would say.  So the age difference is four years, pretty much.  I know that that can be a significant age difference once you get into those years, once you're in your 70s.  But didn't George H.W.  Bush live to be like 92 or 95 or something like that?  They still have a solid couple of decades in front of them.  I mean, think about it.  They're both... Ultra rich.  They're both millionaires.  You think they're not getting the best medical care on the fucking planet?  Both Biden and Trump are going to live for probably 15, 20 more years at least.  I would venture to guess.  Maybe 15.  I don't know where all of this is coming from.  that, you know, Biden's on his last leg and it's going to be a Kamala presidency, blah, blah, blah.  I think Biden's going to make it through the full four years, and I think he could probably do another four after that, honestly.  He is not that old, and he has the best medical care on the planet.

People say, well, he lies about this, that, and the other.  But no, he isn't lying.  To him, that's the truth.  He had the biggest crowd on Inauguration Day.  He had more people than ever.  He was the most popular of people.  He saved NBC.  But with The Apprentice, you go down the line of things that really aren't true. ",

            "text": "Fucking fascinating, dude.  You hearing this guy?  Listen to this shit.  He's acknowledging that Trump lied about his inauguration size.  He's acknowledging that he lied about how important, how big of an impact The Apprentice had on NBC.  He's lying about all this stuff.  But he's pointing out that he doesn't think that Trump is really lying about.  But like I said earlier, the best liars believe their own lies.  He thinks he really believes this shit.  He thinks that Trump lives in his own alternate reality.  And to some degree, I think he's right.  But I think Trump knows exactly what he's doing.  I think he knows exactly what he's doing.  I'm not going to grant him the idea that he's doing this innocently and that he's just delusional.  I don't believe that Trump is delusional.  Ultimately, who fucking knows?  Nobody knows.  It's like the question, is the Jehovah's Witnesses governing body?  Do they know what they're doing?  Are they doing it intentionally?  Are they scam artists?  And are they controlling people, knowing full well that they're lying?  Some old apostates who were actually on the Governing Body for many years, like Ray Franz, for example.  He was asked that question, and his answer was, maybe one or two of the people at the very top know it's a scam and are doing it intentionally, but by and large, the Governing Body believes their own lies.  I think I tend to agree with Pat that Trump does believe his own lies, but Trump goes into some things intentionally trying to control the narrative and scam people.  So that's a little bit different.  Like anytime the media starts coming at Trump over something that's genuinely bad, like calling the military into U.S.  cities with bayonets.  Remember when he did that?  Trump came up with some stupid fucking culture war thing.  I don't remember what it was.  Maybe it was the bathroom bill, you know, trans bathroom bill.  Like, what a petty fucking thing to fight over.  Just let people use whatever bathroom they want to use.  But for some reason, society is... ",
