This video here is on a so-called pastor by the name of Strickland of Kalamazoo, Michigan of the Second Baptist Church there in Michigan in the United States of America.  He is charged with human trafficking and child sex abuse.  The allegations first came forward about two years ago.  He is now also facing charges for an altercation with a former deacon, which are a few charges out of the 11 felonies that he has been charged with.  If it don't get any worse, he is also to have a lynch.  Pay attention.  Alleged to have paid four teenage boys to have sex with his wife.  To find out more information on this story, just type in his name on Google, AOL, or Yahoo search bar.  I understand that, you know, he's accused and charged with 11 felonies, and some might say, well, you know, he still could be innocent, you know, but when you are charged with these types of charges, the police and or the feds had to be watching and obtaining evidence on this so-called pastor.  And these days it is very hard to trust so-called men of God in the pulpits that are claiming to be preachers.  Many out there in the pulpits with hidden agendas to fulfill their pockets.  or to fulfill their wicked sex drives.  It is a sad case, but it's true.  And it's still ongoing in a lot of these churches out here.  And many pastors right now are still getting away with it.  And many church members are afraid to speak up.  Now, if you want to get to know more in-depth information about this situation, just type in the pastor's name, as I stated, in the Google, Yahoo, or AOL search bars and various websites.  will have information pertaining to this story.  Feel free to leave your feedback in the comment section.  I'm Tony Harvin signing off.  Peace. ",
