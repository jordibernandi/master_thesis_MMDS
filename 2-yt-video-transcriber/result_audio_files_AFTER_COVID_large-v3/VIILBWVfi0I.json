And then you have a crowd animator.  And we've run into that when we've done live shows like at U of M, SMU, where we've edited a piece.  For example, like our intro, like DMX or something.  We've edited it.  We're like, oh, we've got to change this.  And it took maybe a month to do.  And then by the time we're running it, we just go, well, just run it.  We don't care.  Because I don't know if this is even funny anymore.  And then the audience explodes without a crowd animator.  But you also see sometimes things don't work, so you remove the energy, you remove the authenticity, and you just tell the audience to laugh.  Exactly.
