            "text": "For about the last two years, God has been calling me to something.  I have fought hard against it.  I've fought, as I always do, to push it out of my mind or out of my heart at times, but it just doesn't go away.  Two years ago, he started to speak to me that he'd opened a large door and he asked me to go through it.  And in those two years, I have found myself in Washington, I found myself in California, I found myself in Europe, in pastor's conferences with pastors that are just starving for a word from God.  Churches that are being called of God to go back to prayer again.  The radio program has just exploded across the nation.  Now we are in 605 stations now that call to prayer.  and 300 stations, 302 I think it is, something like that, a half-hour program called A Call to the Nation.  I knew that if I responded to this call that I couldn't give the time that this church deserves.  This church needs a pastor, it needs a full-time pastor, fully engaged with the 60 or so ministries in this congregation.  A pastor who could be here for the weddings and the funerals and the counseling and the trials, the difficulties and the numerous things that go on every week.  And I knew with the call that God's putting on my life that I couldn't do it.  And you deserve more than just a fly-through pastor that's here once in a while and gone and traveling a lot.  In that context, I will be transitioning into on May the 10th into a new role in Times Square Church as General Overseer of Times Square Church Incorporated.  Now let me explain that role to you.  Times Square Church was just a church when I came here, but now it's five unique and distinct parts.  It's the church, the Bible school, a radio program across the country.  It's a newsletter that goes into 28,000 homes.  And it's pastors' conferences and leaders' conferences that we are part of now, I am part of at least, all around the world.  As General Overseer of Times Square Church Incorporated, I will be here as a guide, leading as best as I can.  I'll be here to advise.  I'll still be speaking.  I'll still be leading the prayer meeting.  The new pastor has asked me to continue the prayer meeting, to guide it on Tuesday nights for the unforeseen future.  And I know this is a bit of a shock.  But the point really is God is calling me.  You saw that.  He bore witness to it today in the worship in this church.  I always look for the witness of the Holy Spirit, that there is a new calling on my life.  And as a church, you will be getting a new pastor on May the 10th.  of this year, a new senior pastor, and I'll be transitioning.  Now, I'm not leaving, okay?  I'm not leaving.  I'll still be sitting here.  I won't be in that first seat anymore, but I'll still be sitting on the platform.  I'll still be speaking when I'm asked to speak, and I'll still be speaking and leading a prayer meeting on Tuesday night.  So I'm not leaving.  I'm gonna be here.  I'm going to stay as a guide.  I'm going to guide the new pastor into that which the Holy Spirit spoke to our founding pastor, David Wilkerson, and pass on as much as I can to the new pastor in the coming couple of years.  I really love this man of God.  To be honest with you, the Lord spoke to me about him about 10 years ago.  and showed me that he was going to be my replacement one day.  So I've known this for quite a long time.  I took two of the elders and Pastor Teresa into confidence 10 years ago and told them, I said, the Lord has shown me who my replacement is, but certain things are gonna have to happen for that day to come.  But I want you to bear witness.  I want you to understand what it happens.  I'm not making this up.  That God spoke to me 10 years ago about this good man of God.  He's not a novice.  He's 55 years old.  He's very, very familiar with this church.  His father was the man, his father was the police captain who, when David Wilkerson... Come on, you can work, you can rejoice.  Thank you.  His father was the police captain who, when David Wilkerson was standing on a box wanting to preach and a local police officer said, you can't.  His father was the man who said, let the man speak.  I don't think he was born then.  You're probably wondering who it is.  His name is Frank Johnson.  Pastor Tim Delina is going to be a great pastor.  Okay.  He is a wonderful friend.  I love him.  I love him.  It's going to be a pleasure for us to work together.  And you have to understand, though, he will be the pastor of this church.  There will not be a duality of leadership here.  I will never allow this to become an I am of Paul and I'm of Apollo situation.  If that ever happened, then I would withdraw completely.  And I have given him my word on that.  I will be here in a helping role, a guiding role for the church, and I'll speak if he asks me to speak, and I'll share if given the opportunity.  I'll be out there on the radio.  For those who are concerned, you will still be able to get the messages I speak on our website, and you'll be able to get those at a website that's been around for quite a while now called carterconlon.com.  It will be connected to the church.  It will not be a separate ministry from Times Square Church.  But just for the sake of order and those who want to hear what God is speaking through me as I travel to pastors' conferences throughout the world, you will be able to go to that website and you'll be able to listen to the messages.  I am honored to have been your pastor for 26 years.  I'm honored to have been with you.  Thank you, Lord.  Thank you.  If you wouldn't mind being seated just for a moment.  I want to read to you from a scripture that the Lord gave me concerning this transition.  In 1 Corinthians chapter 4, verses 15 to 17.  Now, in this light, I want to tell you I'm going to do everything in my power to see Pastor Tim Delina fully established and hit his full stride for this church.  I believe that for Times Square Church, the best is yet to come.  I honestly believe that.  I believe the glory of this latter house is going to be greater than the former.  I am committed.  to putting that baton firmly in his hand.  I'm committed to being a friend, a confident, a guide.  I'm committed to serving and being under the leadership of the new pastor of Times Square Church Incorporated.  And I'm doing this of my own accord because God is leading me.  It's important to know that.  Paul said these words, in 1 Corinthians 4, verse 14.  I do not write these things to shame you, but as my beloved children, I warn you.  For though you have 10,000 instructors in Christ, yet you do not have many fathers.  For in Christ Jesus, I have begotten you through the gospel.  Therefore, I urge you, imitate me.  So I'm asking you as a church body to give your full heart and your full support to Pastor Tim Delina.  He is not my choice.  He is God's choice.  You have to understand that.  He's God's choice.  God chose him to do this.  God took him to the school he needed to go through to prepare him.  He's been learning and he's a very quick learner.  He's very bright.  I thank God.  It's going to take this church to a whole new place.  Verse 17, and I love this because I sent this to Pastor Tim a little while ago.  It says, for this reason, I've sent Timothy to you.  who is my beloved and faithful son in the Lord, who will remind you of my ways in Christ as I teach everywhere and in every church.  So Paul was moving on to do what God had called him to do, and he sent Timothy to look after the church.  I think we're going to have, I think it's just going to be a great journey.  I honestly do.  I have a gladness in my heart about it.  And Anyhow, I want to read to you, this is the letter that's going to be going out on all of our social media, just so everyone understands.
