She had emails and he had a whole goddamn laptop and not just a MacBook, but a MacBook Pro.  A pro.  I went to all the gaslighting rallies and he was dancing.  Sure, it looked like he was riding on an elliptical, but he danced.  That's got to count for something.  This country is going to collapse under Joe.  I can't even say his name.  I would have called him 47 on account of Mike Pence is probably going to be 46 because He's going to have to pardon everybody.  I just got the truck reflagged.  I got all this bootleg merch.  And worst of all, I'm going to have to get a new personality.  He's still your president.  At least for a few more months.  In the arms of the angels.  Some comfort here. ",
