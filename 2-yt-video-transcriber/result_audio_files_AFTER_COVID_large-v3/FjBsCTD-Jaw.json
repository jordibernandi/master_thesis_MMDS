            "text": "Well, my brother and I are the ones who came up with this idea, the world's largest American flag.  In this time in our country, we felt it was very important to do something like this.  People want to be proud of something.  They want to gather around something.  And right now, the flag is getting attacked, and the forces are advancing.  This is a pushback time.  What we did with this flag last time it was unfurled was 2013, so it doesn't come out very often.  But it's... It weighs 3,000 pounds.  It takes 500 people to carry.  And it came to me, what if we took the largest flag ever made, and I call it the hourglass concept because these lights represent people's cell phones or flashlights.  We have different religions, different nationalities, different politics, come from different parts of the country.  But we're all Americans, and we all unite tight in light for those who gave made the ultimate sacrifice.  The military holds the flag because they defend the country.  They defend what this flag stands for, liberty, freedom.  The people are lighting it.  This flag is crying out, illuminate me, illuminate me.  And what do we hear?  The thunderous roar of liberty, freedom.  And so when they leave from this side, we all go our separate ways.  Therefore, the hourglass concept, we're going to shine that flag.  That flag means people want to rally around something.  They want to be proud of something.  At 9 o'clock, it's scheduled to go.  And that's when we'll play the national anthem.  We'll say Pledge of Allegiance.  There'll be a few speakers.  And then we play patriotic music, the four, the... the armed services songs, and just walk.  The veterans will lead the procession.  And a lady just came here.  She saw it on Facebook.  The only reason she came 1,600 miles was for this event. ",

All right.  Actually, Los Alamitos.  77-year-old lady owns it.  We got to get, we need 500 people to hold the flag.  500?  Yes, minimum of 500.  How tall is it?  It's not tall.  It lays flat off the ground.  Yeah.  So there are 500 people around it, and then another 100 underneath to make sure it doesn't touch the ground.  That sounds awesome.  Yeah.  Patriotism is what's going to save this country.  That's right.  And this country so needs a pushback because the enemy has been advancing.  It is.  And we're the epicenter right now with what we're doing, and we're pushing back, and we're showing there are patriots, and that's what's going to save the country.  And when I hold my light and I walk under that flag, it's for those three men.  Oh, wow.  who died at Pensacola Air Force Base.  When the guy came in, the Saudi guy came and shot him.  He's just on watch.  One of my sons in the Navy, he was just there months earlier doing the same watch.  So it's, you know.  By the grace of God.  So that's what my lights were, those three young men.  I'm thinking of them as I walk into that flag.  .  .  .  .  Thank you.  Thank you. ",
