This is law-abiding activity.  This is my First Amendment right to speak up against my government.  It is not your opportunity to harass me, to intimidate me, to trust me, to hurt me.  We will not take your information.  Long before I was aware there were people filming the police and putting the videos up on YouTube, I made this video.  There were a group of protesters, about 20, across the street from this family courthouse.  And yet there were several police officers who were gloving up.  And this is Officer Ray.  He was on the phone with what appeared to be a judge who was giving him orders that made him vastly uncomfortable.  We are doing nothing wrong.  It violates our First Amendment right.  You must read the U.S.  Constitution.  You must read the California Constitution.  This is law of violent activity.  Pastor Gomez, great, how are you?  I'm good, thank you.  From public records requests that I had made of the courthouse, I knew that the judges and the lawyers inside that courthouse were very upset about people protesting outside the courthouse.  It was bad for business when people talked about judges taking their children or ordering them to pay too much child support.  But the crowd was not threatening, and it had been moved across the street.  Abide by the order.  I am on a city sidewalk.  I will continue to protest family court.  I am not doing anything wrong.  Officer Ray had in his hand an order that said that nobody would be permitted to protest on the sidewalk outside that courthouse.  When those police officers left that courthouse and walked onto the sidewalk, they left their jurisdiction, meaning that it would be the San Jose Police Department that would be required to make the arrest.  But police officers know that they are not allowed to make arrests on unconstitutional orders.  And that is perhaps why Officer Ray was so concerned.  He didn't immediately arrest the protester.  He continued to pace back and forth.  He continued to watch him.  They followed him, three police officers, far more than we ever saw on any protester at the U.S.  Capitol.  And then Officer Ray got on the phone again.  clearly uncomfortable with being ordered by judge patricia lucas the presiding judge to make an arrest on a sidewalk outside that courthouse where he knew he had no jurisdiction.  but the protester continued and i happened to know this protester because he had done some camera work for me for a time.  the other protesters stayed across the street until they realized what was happening and then more of them started to come over and record the police.  Officer Ray continued to call the judge, and then he grabbed the order, and he showed the order to the protester.  I don't want it. ",

I'm fighting for my daughter.  Live on Facebook.  Live on Facebook.  Live on Facebook.  It was when those protesters came to the sidewalk and started to record the police that everything changed.  It appeared the sheriff's deputy shoved the first protester, who was my associate, down to the ground.  They then started to tell him that they were going to arrest him for resisting arrest.  They were not interested in arresting the other protesters, only my associate.  These people had been out there protesting the family courts.  They were angry and they were hostile, but they were not violent and they were not engaged in criminal activity.  So when those sheriffs walked outside of their jurisdiction onto a city sidewalk in the city of San Jose, where the San Jose Police Department has jurisdiction, They then violated this man's civil rights.  They violated the oath, they violated their training, and they violated the Constitution in order to enforce a single order issued by a judge who didn't want us talking about what was going on inside that courthouse.  and i could tell by the look on officer gomez's face he was very uncomfortable.  he was violating somebody's civil rights for a second time and this time it wasn't me but it was my associate.  all of those video cameras and body cams were picking up what the police officers were saying and my associate was prosecuted for nearly a year.  i got the police reports because he's also a witness on the day that officer gomez violated my civil rights and the district attorney decided to prosecute me instead.  but what i didn't get was those body cams.  So after a year, I finally decided to produce my videos to my associate's criminal defense attorney, and the criminal charges against him were immediately dismissed.  And it was at that point that he had a civil rights claim against the county as well.  But along the way to that civil rights claim, my associate decided to engage in conduct that was no longer acceptable.  He attacked the First Amendment auditors on YouTube, He also did unlawful DCMA claims to take down videos in order to interfere with our business.  And then he became verbally abusive and a physical threat to many of my other associates in a manner that could no longer be tolerated. ",

And Mr.  Hammond, is it true that you're representing Mr.  Stephon for free so that you can get part of a settlement from the county that you've colluded with Judge Towery and others?  Do you have a comment, Mr.  Stephon?  Mr. ",
