What kind of amusement park could this be?  Clearly a repurposed building.  But where?  This building is in Japan.  And this is Disney World in Japan.  The Tower of Terror at DisneySea.  So here we go.  In Tokyo.  Japan.  The Tower of Terror.  Really seeming like the Tower of Tartaria, but not the point of this video.  Welcome.  Today I wanted to talk about the railways.  In the last video, we had a look at the beautiful hotel in Quebec, Canada, and truly adding some new depth to the idea of constructing these rail systems all across North America in this early time period of the 1800s.  And I've had comments, and people said their grandfathers had worked on the rails.  People have worked on the rails but laying of tracks being the easiest part of creating a railway system oftentimes traversing great ravines and canyons and having to build bridges at other times boring through mountains and making tunnels and most certainly throughout this whole process moving huge amounts of earth in order to allow the laying of level tracks and again tracks aside This alone, and the idea that this much dirt could be moved with horse, oxen, and wagon, is completely absurd.  Very similar to dredging out many of these canals.  Laying of the rails is very similar.  And here we're told.  the history of railroads begins in the 1720s.  A railroad was reportedly used in the construction of the French Fortress in Nova Scotia.  Railroads played a large role in the development of the United States around 1810 to 1850.  The American railroad mania began with the founding of the first passenger and freight line in the nation being the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in 1827.  And the laying of the first stone and the beginning of its long construction heading westward over the obstacles of the Appalachian Mountains would begin in 1828 and the construction and expansion would continue for the next 45 years until the financial panic of 1873.  Followed by a major economic depression, many companies went bankrupt and growth was halted.  And here's a little look at a bridge, for example, an old bridge.  And this is just one boring little part.  Nothing spectacular, perhaps hundreds similar to this, must be built.  The building of a train or a canal, once again, is so much more than what it initially seems in the passing.  and how would that fit into the false narrative that the ancients had advanced trains and perhaps more advanced?
