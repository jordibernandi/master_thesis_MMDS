            "text": "I think many people will be surprised by my answer on this one.  I mean, if you've been following me for a long time, you know about the free agent lifestyle tenets, which is no cohabitation, no long-term relationships, and no marriage.  Now, before I say that, I believe marriage is about a lot of things, but at least these two things matter.  building families, and building community.  Now, can you say that either exists very well right now?  There's not a lot of communities.  Not many people know their neighbors.  Families have been destroyed.  Now, when it comes to men, I believe men overwhelmingly want to be married.  I've been married.  I wish I had a successful marriage.  Many men that have been divorced wish they had a successful marriage.  And many men in here, I know, when we did the patriarch talk, they wanted children.  They wanted marriages.  Now, when I say the three tenets of the free agent lifestyle, I say that for two reasons.  Namely, people brought it up already, the government.  Their involvement has destroyed the institution of marriage.  They don't give many couples options, and they interfere.  I try to advise men of what they can do.  anticipate if they decide to be married and that therefore if they don't do their due diligence and they rely on the media to sell the marriage which they say it's about love well then what's going to happen is he's going to find out the hard way that there are judges mediators lawyers child support offices child protective services court county clerks, a lot of people that are involved in the institution of marriage, which benefits the court if your family is destroyed.  So I say those three tenants as a means to have a silent protest until there's marriage reform.  And if there is marriage reform, then we can say, let's be about family and community again.  Until then, I tell men, you really have to do your homework, not only with the woman that you want to be involved with, but what the family law codes are associated with.  If you are one of the 60% of first divorces, 70% of second marriages dissolving, and almost 80% of third marriages dissolving with eight out of 10 of them being women initiating them.  So is the woman important here?  Is your selection of that woman important?  Well, she will dictate whether she will lead you to the slaughter.  Until then, I say no to marriage until we resolve the issue. ",

They say you're bitter, you're hurt, you failed at your relationship, although there's a million divorces per year, okay, per year in this country.  But the one thing that will keep me talking is the fact that people never call me a liar, okay?  And when people start calling me a liar, then I will have to find solutions to adjust my message.  But the truth is the truth, whether you like it or not.  I advise men to not live by the hope strategy because hope is not a strategy.  You can't hope, wish, anything.  You have to know, and not only know, you have to accept hope.  You want to accept the data, you accept it for what it is. ",
