            "text": "The diapers is not a joke.  It depends.  Diaper Don is trending, but it's based in reality.  He would often soil himself on The Apprentice set.  He's incontinent from all the speed, all the Adderall he does, the cocaine that he's done for decades.  All that stuff has a laxative, and it has an effect on your bowels, and his are uncontrollable.  He's worn diapers since probably the nineties, but I saw it firsthand in the 2000s on Celebrity Apprentice in late 2000s and we'd have to stop the show and change him, you know, and that was Keith Schiller's job.  He would take him off set, he would wipe him down.  Our nickname for Keith was Wet Wipes.  It's not a joke.  It's happened several times and you've seen it happen while he's in office.  You've seen he was in the Oval Office with Erdogan and you could clearly hear him sort of evacuating himself.  He did it in front of Senator Feinstein, Dianne Feinstein, at a press conference.  So he does it and he almost sits there like unaware of it.  And one time I saw Ivanka have to go kind of whisper in his ear and then Keith came and took him off stage.  He'll also do it in a rage.  And this is where it gets really drug related.  He'll start to freak out.  One time there was the word arbitrage on a cue card and he started screaming that the script department was setting him up.  You're setting me up.  And he just freaked out and then very loudly screamed.  evacuated his bowels and you could smell it you know and the guy was holding the boom bike mic you know was tearing up.  so that's where the nickname the SHIT show came from.  that was the crew nickname for Celebrity Apprentice.  so when you hear Diaper Don it's not a joke.  He tries to hide it.  I'll give you one more fact.  If you look up the video of him when he was doing the WWF thing, he tackles a guy on the ground outside of the ring, and you can clearly see the outline of the Depends in his pants.  And that was back in the early 90s.  So he's lost control of his bowels.  He's lost control of his brain.  That's who he is, Diaper Don. ",
