            "text": "A few weeks later, Fort Bend County Sheriff's deputy shot and killed an innocent man.  The man wasn't resisting, he wasn't fighting, he wasn't running away.  Sure, he was armed, but that's part of the job when you're a police officer.  The victim was 37-year-old Caleb Rule.  He was a deputy constable at the Precinct 4 constable's office in Fort Bend County.  And this recently filed report with the Texas Attorney General's office provides more information about the deputy sheriff who shot him.  But the Fort Bend County Sheriff's Office continues to hide the details, conceal the identity of the shooter, and really just keep everyone in the dark.  And if you've been following my channel, you know that I investigate a lot of the high-profile officer-involved shootings in Texas, oftentimes working to identify the shooter and figure out why did this happen.  And no doubt this incident will be the same.  I'll get to the bottom of it eventually.  But today, this story isn't about that, about the shooter.  It's about me, a voter, looking for answers from Fort Bend County Sheriff Troy Nels, who's also running for Congress.  Most of the time when I go up to the sheriff's office, administrative office during business hours, the sheriff isn't there.  So imagine my excitement when I pulled in the parking lot in his regular vehicle and also the Mustang that he often takes to public events and shows off.  Both of them were in the parking lot, so I knew he'd be inside.  I guess is it now okay to use asset forfeiture for just about anything in Texas, including even campaigning and publicity?  The sheriff was walking down the hall when I walked in the lobby, but he didn't let me in.  So although this report substantially narrowed it down, I'm not going to reveal the identity of the shooter today.  Hopefully the sheriff will do the right thing, come clean, show all the body cam, reveal the details, and so maybe there will be some justice. ",

So although the sheriff was too busy to come out and talk to me, after I gave the request to Patrol Captain Holtz, he immediately went into the sheriff's office and other sheriff's office administrators were coming in and out after that.  It was really quite a sight.  My sheriff, Troy Nails, he's running to be the newest United States congressman from Southeast Texas.  It's an open seat.  The incumbent's retiring.  He's in a runoff election in the Republican primary right now, and there will be a Democrat challenger in November for whoever wins that.  So Congress, the House of Representatives, that's like the republic part of our government, our constitutional government.  where we elect representatives to go to Washington.  And what are they supposed to do in Washington?  I would like to think that it's to represent the voters, the local constituents back home, and represent them, bring their voice, and represent them up in the Congressional Assembly.  Maybe other things are all too often represented instead.  It's concerning to me.  Maybe it's concerning to you that even as only a countywide elected official, he's not accessible to the voters, at least to this voter.  And then if he becomes my congressman, do I expect to have any representation up in Washington,  D.C.?  And remember, stepping aside from the journalism, I'm a longtime conservative Republican activist.  You'd think that someone running in the Republican Party primary would want to talk to me, maybe even try to win me over.  So the players in the local politics here in Fort Bend County, it kind of can be some factions of tight-knit people.  And so back to this shooting where it was a deputy constable in Precinct 4.  Let me tell you about the elected constable out there.  His name's Trevor Nels.  That's right.  The sheriff's brother is the elected constable.  And there's even more to it than that.  Right now, Trevor Nels is running for the sheriff's seat.  So you have the constable who's running for the sheriff's office.  His deputy was shot and killed by a sheriff's deputy, by his brother's sheriff's deputy.  When there's two agencies involved, you might think that there'd be a lot of more transparency because it would be harder to keep everyone quiet.  So I'm sitting back here wondering still, why are we all in the dark?  Will there be truth?  Will we have justice?  Or will it be only the politics as usual?  This is what the crime scene looked like exactly 24 hours after the shooting.  As you can see, well, I'm just going to step out and let it play so you can see just how quiet, calm, and well-lit this scene is.  I was pretty shocked to be the only one out there.  I thought certainly there would be someone from the sheriff's office and constable's office taking notes and impressions of what it was like there in that location at that time of night.  Very important to an investigation, especially the one in the nature of what has been billed by many as friendly fire.  You would think the exact scene, environment, lighting, really everything around there at that time, would be central to such investigation.  I guess I might just be thinking too highly of the government.  I thought they would be out there.  I thought they would be doing a very diligent investigation.  After all, it is one of their own.  But perhaps my expectations are just a little bit too high.  I continue to wait outside the sheriff's office.  I knew he would have a couple minutes to, certainly he would wanna answer some questions from a voter who was very concerned about all this.  And I was looking for real answers and keep watching if you wanna see the real answers that certainly we know the elected sheriff who's running for Congress would provide.  Fortunately, there's other options to get to the real story besides just waiting on Trevor Nels and Troy Nels.  So I went up to the Precinct 3 constable's office looking for information.  There I dropped off a records request and I talked to Constable Wayne Thompson. ",

He's running for Precinct 3 Constable.  Yes, let's summarize that.  So the sheriff's running for Congress, the sheriff's brother's running for sheriff, and one of the top sheriff's administrators is running for constable.  I'm not just there to have a little chitchat to get to know someone who's running for office.  I have real questions.  These are important questions that a lot of people want answers for.  And so certainly a transparent official would at least answer two or three questions on the way out to the car on his way to his next appointment, which, by the way, is the funeral for fallen officer Caleb Ruhle.  I won't stop looking until we know exactly what happened and how it happened.  I submitted open records requests across the county, really across the state.  Unfortunately, I haven't heard back from anyone except for one agency, the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement.  Nothing out of the county, nothing from Texas DPS.  I wouldn't be surprised to learn that they actually spent more time trying to figure out how to dodge me than just coming out and answering the questions.  It's not that hard to tell the truth.  It wouldn't take long and then we could all know what really happened.  Thank you.  I wish I could say I'm totally shocked.  No, I kind of expected it.  This happens to me a lot.  He had someone go and pull his truck out of the front parking lot where it's publicly accessible back into the back where all the sheriff's deputies keep their fleet vehicles.  And so it's a fenced in where he could sneak out the back door, get in and leave without me being able to ask these very important questions that many people in Fort Bend County and across the state would like to have answers to.  This is so pathetic, I can't even laugh about it.  And it gets even worse.  I guess, not to be outdone by the deputies, they've all been instructed now that they're not to talk to me.  They refer me, oh, just go ask for records or PIO, but they don't give out records either.  There's more to this story, and I'll be covering it one way or the other.  I hope that the information will come from Sheriff Troy Nels, and if not, it will come out.  Don't y'all worry.  So be sure to subscribe to my channel, enable all notifications.  Please always film the police and the government, and never miss an opportunity to ask a hard question of an elected official.  Thanks for watching.  I hope you have a great day.
