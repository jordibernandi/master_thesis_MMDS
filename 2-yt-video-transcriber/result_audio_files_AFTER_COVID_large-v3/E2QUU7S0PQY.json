            "text": "I told him the real deal about Trump that people didn't know.  He was an open drug addict.  Everyone knew it.  None of this stuff was a secret.  You know, he was doing coke on shows 20 years ago when we'd do... you know, the VH1 fashion awards, and I used to do the beauty pageants with him in the 90s.  You know, he was an open drug user, open sexual assaulter, and this stuff was just kind of accepted.  And it's not you heard this firsthand, it's you saw this with your own eyes.  Absolutely.  That's when most of the drug use occurred on The Apprentice, when he had to read cue cards.  He'd get really nervous, so he'd go in the bathroom, crush up Adderall, he'd come back to set, there'd be white chunks flying out of his nose, white powder under his nose, He's doing the same thing as a candidate and as a president.  It gives him a feeling of being in control.  But he's clearly an addict.  If you know anything about addiction, Untreated addiction as a president is the worst thing you could have.  So, yeah, he was obviously high that night.  That was the same person we saw in The Apprentice.  And I remember watching that and like, yep, he's high.  And it probably wasn't just Adderall.  He did coke.  He did meth.  He had drug dealers coming to the after parties, selling it to him.  Adderall is his maintenance high.  It's what he does during the day.  When he gets down to Mar-a-Lago and these other places, he gets into it a little harder.  He also uses benzodiazepine, you know, Valium and stuff, to calm down when he hits it hard.  So when you see him slurring and stuff, that's from the benzos. ",

            "text": "Well, I have a few thoughts about it.  First of all, the thing that is, I had a chapter in my book that I did not submit to the publisher, which was called The Adderall Presidency.  And I decided that there was not enough data, there was hard data about it.  But in terms of evidence, and I wish that, you know, I had known Noel earlier about and that there was some more data available.  But basically, his behavior is very similar to people who are very heavily into cocaine or Adderall.  There was a book written last year called Blitzed, maybe two years ago now, about the use of amphetamines by the Blitzkrieg, by the Luftwaffe, and by Hitler's people.  And it allowed people to essentially be awake you know, 18 to 20 hours a day and be really high and on and able to kind of stay alert and not need a lot of sleep.  And I do think that that is not something I would rule out at all about President Trump.  He does sniff an awful lot when he gives his talks.  Even now you can hear him sniffing between sentences or even in the middle of a sentence.  And that's something that you see with people who have their nasal passages slightly worn down by cocaine or Adderall, that it's snorted.  And the problem is that people who have early signs of particular word-finding prefrontal dementia also sniff when they talk.  And it's hard to know which is which without having a proper MRI and a proper neurological evaluation, and he needs that.  So those are my first thoughts.  The second thought is about Adderall per se.  Adderall is only available, as far as I know, by prescription.  So I'm just wondering who gives him the prescriptions.  Who's his doctor?  Where is he getting?  Probably Ronnie. ",

            "text": "He is the White House physician, but you have, there is so much control.  I mean, it's true he's the president, and you can get past controls, I guess.  But, you know, to write a prescription now, you have to write it out.  It has to be a duplicate.  I mean, I have to get all kinds of permission to give it to people.  I think the second question, that is, he doesn't have to get that because cocaine is illegal.  You could buy that through any kind of a dealer, and he may have dealers.  Clearly, he is speedy in certain ways.  His tweets in the middle of the night, his getting up very early, all are consistent with some kind of abuse behavior.  of a psychic stimulant, psychological stimulant.  I don't know where to go with that, except that's probably the case.  The biggest problem with the stimulants in a president or anybody who has a responsible job is that the first thing that gets compromised is judgment.  So people actually can't assess the sanity of what they're saying, but they don't have the judgment in terms of thinking about the consequences of what they're saying and what's going to happen.  So it's very similar to alcohol, actually, ironically, that judgment is soluble in alcohol.  But the second problem that's related specifically to stimulants is impulsive behavior, and people are much more comfortable being impulsive, shooting from the hip, saying things impulsively.  And then the third thing is rage reactions.  People who use a lot of amphetamines have acute rage reactions, recurring rage reactions, and those are really disturbing, if that's the case with President Trump. ",
