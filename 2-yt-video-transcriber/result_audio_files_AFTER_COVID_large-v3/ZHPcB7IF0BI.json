This is a generational thing.  And I don't know at this stage that we can say it's completely a political movement.  It's some kind of counter-revolution that has been going on.  It believes, as you know, that speech is harm and harm is not harm, that silence is violence and violence is fine.  It has a set of mantras, and I simply think it won't stop until it hits the reality of this life.  It seems to me that something very wrong has happened with your media, not just the broadcast media, but the print media.  I don't want to get stuck on it, but I mean, every country I know about, I know the New York Times can prove that it's lying.  So I can't read it because any country I don't know very much about, I would assume that they're lying, but I wouldn't know exactly how.  So you've got a very deep problem in your legacy media.  And obviously, a lot of people have been pointing that out for a long time.  And I wonder now if Trump does go, those papers and magazines will be in want of an enemy.  And often, as you know, that's the worst thing for a person is if they lose their enemy.  But yes, we don't have that many problems.  The problem we do all have, it seems to me, and you've written about this, as you know, as well as anyone, is that people have become very bad at listening to a contrary opinion.  And that is, I think that's going to prove to be a generational thing.  That there just is, I speak 24 hours after the news came out, Jordan Peterson's publishers in Canada, that there'd been wailing gnashing of teeth, actual tears at the staff meeting when some employees of, it's Penguin, Penguin Random House, some of the employees of Penguin discovered that they were gonna publish another book next year by a man who's actually earned them their salaries.  Quite literally, by the way. ",

It has a set of mantras and I simply think it won't stop until it hits the reality of this life.  I don't know when that'll happen.  I just hope it happens very, very soon.  I think that everybody who cried at the meeting, I said this this morning on social media, everybody who cried at the meeting and said that they didn't want to be at the publishing house that published Jordan Peterson, bang, sacked, out.  Next morning, your job is advertised.  So many smart young men and women should be in the publishing business and have a very, very good reason to be so and could be excellent in their chosen profession.  And they're not because these people who have no right to be in a publishing house are in it and clogging up and making everyone stupider.  And so these people, it has to be felt.  We have to make sure that media... companies and others are not held hostage by the stupidest, youngest, most ignorant people in the room. ",

Thus, they destroy their own entities.  I'm completely with you and I run businesses.  If I had employees that were upset with me over my decision-making, goodbye, goodbye, that's it.

I'm sure you've heard many times.  Thankfully, nobody has actually said it to my face or they'd have it coming to them.  But I have heard a lot of people told in recent years, educate yourself.  Everybody who says educate yourself, in my observation, is without exception the dimmest person I have seen speaking.  They have no right to go around being the stupidest person in the room telling everyone else to educate themselves.  They don't mean educate yourself.  They mean agree with me or else.  Well, here's a suggestion.  The adults say no.  you do not know anything.  You're 23.  You've got a totalistic view of the universe that you're going to discover quite soon at some point in your life is wildly wrong.  And you are making yourself unemployable.  Here is your unemployment form.  Your job's up for advert tomorrow.  That's what the adults have to do.  I'm fed up, by the way, of CEOs and heads of companies and all sorts of things.  But ever since the madness of crowds came out, I find they sidle up to me, they whisper up to me and tell me that this is what they have.  And I'm fed up with the whisperers and the sidlers.  I'm fed up with the adults, the people at the tops of their careers, all of whom are bowing down.  It's like that video that went viral the other day of this.

And if that means stripping a whole load of under 30s out, then fine.  There are a lot of very smart under 30s who could fill those positions and would do a great and noble a job at it.  But it is absolutely incumbent upon people, as you know, it's what I argue in the manners of crowds, to understand that that is what we are dealing with.  Once you play the diversity and equity game, you are infusing the lungs of your employees with this asbestos.  and you have to get it out now. ",
