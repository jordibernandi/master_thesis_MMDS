            "text": "What are the seven laws of the universe?  I am your host, Mattias Stefano.  In this episode, we will explore how the seven laws of the universe affect you and how you cannot escape it.  When I used to live in Gludok, in Sirius, we had the laws of the universe like the main school teaching.  What we've learned is that there are some rules that you cannot escape from, that there are some rules from the core of the universe that states the whole universe in a kind of an order.  So it doesn't matter at what time you go, what space you go, what do you create in the universe, you will have these seven laws of the universe that will hold you to be in order of the creation and expansion of the universe.  When the inner people from Gludok and other beings from this galaxy start to teach humanity how to learn about these laws that go through every dimension, They knew that we as humanity in this planet of the third dimension were not able to understand the seven laws of the universe just by thinking about them or just by seeing them like a whole.  So in this planet, we start to create the initiatic path.  The initiatic paths were built by ancient civilizations in order to teach people how to integrate the seven laws of the universe and to become a god on earth.  The only way you can create a new reality is if you know the laws that holds those realities.  So that's why we needed to understand how to handle them.  And if you cannot go away from these seven laws, then you have to become the seven laws.  2,000 years ago, I was born in northern Egypt.  Egypt didn't exist.  It was a colony of Atlantis.  We call Atlantis Khephien, and we call the river Nile Tulfa.  And this region was called Khem.  I was a woman there, and women were in charge of government at that time.  It was matriarchal government.  And we were the ones that lead people as mothers to go through the temples of reality so we could prepare them as our sons to be ready to become gods and goddesses.  The whole path of the River Nile was built towards the seven laws in which our ancient families from Atlantis, from Cretan, they taught us how to build these temples in order to prepare these people to be aware of their divinity.  Those schools they were learning about every law were just temples.  But doesn't matter where do you go in the universe.  If you go to desert, if you go to the forest, you will find them.  Doesn't matter if there is a temple or not.  You will find the laws everywhere.  You will find them because they are within you.  In the world of 3D, we had to split in several parts these laws so we could understand each other within us.  And reality had separated these laws.  that were just one in the seven laws of our own body, what we call the seven chakras.  The seven inner chakras of our body, which are not only parts of the body, but also organs and glands, particular glands that help us to exist, to live, are also bounded to the laws of the universe.  So we, in our daily life, we have to be clear and consequent with the action of every one of those glands because they reflect the laws of the universe.  So if you are coherent with every one of them, you can achieve the seven laws of the universe within.  The place or the moment where you can find the seven laws of the universe is in the seventh dimension.  The seventh dimension was born from the sixth dimension and all the others.  that creates this shape of the octahedron.  this core of the first dimension, creating the duality in the second dimension, creating the fourth dimension and in between the third dimension, creates after that the fifth dimension above to see the whole process and then below the sixth dimension to transform and to be an alchemist, a creator of your own reality.  The seventh dimension will go to the core of reality in the center of the universe.  So that's why the seventh dimension is called the dimension of enlightenment.  It's the dimension where everything is kind of so well and so fine that we used to call it heaven.  For many people that is religious, when they talk about heaven, we are talking about the seventh dimension.  It is the place, the moment of the universe where you can feel everything, when you can see everything and you have so much light and so much clarify of yourself.  that you can see everything and you are not in need of creating anything else.  You just have realized that you are.  The people and beings that live in the seventh dimension, they are so coherent in the seven laws of the universe as one that they just dream about realities.  They are just like kids, smiling and laughing the whole time, like someone that has accomplished everything and accomplished harmony.  The seventh dimension is in the core of this reality, held by the fifth, the sixth, and the fourth dimension.  It's connected to the mind and the dream of the creator.  So in the seventh dimension, you can feel every possibility of who you are, who could you be, and you just have to think about it, and you will see it, and you will feel it.  So the first law of the seven is indeed the only law that exists.  There is no seven laws.  It's just one law of the whole universe.  Everything is mine.  So whatever you think and project as you're thinking, your thoughts would become real.  So in order to be understandable for the third dimension and to be lived by the third dimensional beings, the seventh dimension has to be split in seven parts to be seen.  That's why we say there are seven laws.  But it's just one law split in seven, so we, as beings in the material world, we can also attach those laws within, in every chakra that was created in the sixth dimension.  The first law would be the mind, so the crown chakra.  We call it mentalism.  Mentalism is the first law of the whole universe and is the one that creates everything else.  The crown chakra holds the law of mentalism and it's the chakra and the law that says that everything that you live is what you believe.  Everything that you experience is what you are thinking.  Mind is not something that you think, I want this.  Mind is something you have to become.  The mind is your vibration, what you are.  is the levels and waves that you split all around your creation, your body, your being.  If you say, I want this, the universe will create the wave of.  I want, I want, I want.  So you will always experience the I want, but you won't have anything.  Because your wave of thinking, it is just the need of something.  So you have to change the way you move the energy through your mind.  You have to become what you want.  That's why we think we want some stuff or we would become some stuff, but we always think in future.  That's why the universe never brings you what you think in future, because future doesn't exist.  So you have to think always in present and become that present to you.  Even if you don't have that, the only way that the mind creates that reality is when the mind knows that that reality is yourself.  So you don't have to think in the future.  You have to be your thinking.  And that's the coherence.  That's why the crown chakra means mentalism.  Mentalism is what you are, not what you think you want to be.  So the spirit knows that it is something, that it is a being that is trying to learn from itself.  That's why we are not perfect.  We as reality are imperfect all the time because if we were perfect, how the being would experience something?  to understand itself?  You need to be different from each other to see different perspectives.  That's why reality is not perfect.  The perfection of the reality is its imperfection because the spirit knows that in order to understand itself must become imperfect. ",
