            "text": "Thank you for joining us today for this very important occasion.  I'm here today because, sadly, it's time for us to say goodbye to our beloved, untitled lamp slash bear designed by the talented Urs Fischer.  And we know him as Blue Note.  After four years on our campus, today, Bluno is graduating with the class of 2020.  All students at Brown have had the opportunity to make meaningful change, but few have had such an outsized impact on the geography of our campus as Bluno.  I have to say, from Bluno's first moments on the Simmons quad, he was impossible to ignore.  In those early days, when Bluno was a first year student, not everyone knew what to make of him.  In fact, we didn't even know what to call him.  But over time, he's become a beloved part of our community.  Bluno has been right there for us on morning walks to class, evening gatherings, and big events like graduations and reunions.  And our students have taken care of Bluno.  One student even knitted him a very, very large scarf.  He's been the subject of countless selfies, and he's shared many joyful moments with us.  Unfortunately, his time here at Brown has come to end, as it does for all of our students.  Bluno, as you move out into the world beyond the Van Wickle gates, take with you the hearts of all those you touched in the Brown community.  We'll always remember your enormous contribution.  It's only fitting that we honor your journey and celebrate your graduation.  .  By virtue of the authority vested in me, I confer upon you this bachelor's degree.  Now go out and make Brown proud. ",
