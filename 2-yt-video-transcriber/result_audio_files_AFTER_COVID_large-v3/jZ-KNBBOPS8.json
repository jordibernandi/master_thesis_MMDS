            "text": "So there has been a major development in the UK human rights sphere, specifically relating to ongoing attacks on the rights of trans people, something I've discussed and revisited in the past.  For those who don't know, a group consisting of fascists, homophobes, biphobes, racists and misogynists pretending to be feminists, a group that likes to label themselves gender critical, has been chipping away at trans rights in the UK, as well as trying to prevent further provisions.  Now, in order to achieve this, the so-called gender-critical camp has been propagating a number of myths, such as the idea that trans women pose a threat to cis women, something far-right groups later admitted they'd made up, stating that, quote, \"...our side concocted the bathroom safety male predator argument as a way to avoid an uncomfortable battle over LGBT ideology and still fire up people's  emotions.\".  end quote.  Another popular myth spouted is the idea that the trans cult is indoctrinating young people and turning them transgender, typically focusing on trans men.  A common practice in this regard is to show photos of minors prior to going through their medical confirmation and post, remarking about how they're lost potential, sexually.  that they should have just been a butch lesbian, irrespective of the sexuality of the person in question, since gay, bisexual, and ace trans men do exist.  This sense of sexual entitlement among gender-critical folk mirroring that seen in cis-et men towards non-heterosexual women.  A myth that doesn't add up with the evidence in how the vast majority of youth refer to gender identity.  clinics, clinics which take the child-led gender-affirmative approach desist without seeking further support.  Because if there really was a trans cult at work here, we'd expect to see most, if not all, of said people go on to receive medical support.  The truth, meanwhile, is simple.  There are key, observable differences between trans youth and youth simply exploring who they are, differences professionals can use to guide teens down the path best suited to meeting their needs and ensuring their well-being.  That's why those that remain and are started on puberty blockers, a flu-reversible medication used to delay puberty to offer the individual more time to arrive at the right conclusion, have a 100% persistence rate with the individual going on to pursue HRT or confirmation surgery.  It's not because of some fictional cabal, it's because our systems are so cautious that they filter out those simply exploring who they are.  However, recent reports show this lie to be based in projection, with gender-criticals claiming their targets are guilty of what they themselves do.  Enter Amy Dias, former member of the gender-critical cult, and that's a word she herself uses.  In an interview conducted by Pink News journalist Vic Parsons, Amy Dias laid out some of the many ways that she was groomed, stripped of her autonomy, and even had her abuse ignored by the very people claiming to care about her as a lesbian.  She talks about the way in which As she was first becoming aware of the gender-critical cult, she was approached by a series of well-known names who constantly checked in and fed her this narrative that lesbians were under attack by trans people.  Now Diaz talks about the fact that, at the time all this was happening, she was in a vulnerable state.  She'd lost her job and her home and was living out of her car, something which understandably had a profound impact on her mental state.  To quote, for the first time, Amy's voice breaks a little as she recounts what this period of her life was like.  I felt like everybody knew and they just would exploit.  Instead of helping, they would just keep taking from you.  They wanted you to be unstable.  She pauses.  That's like I noticed.  It was at this point that the emotional and sexual abuse she experienced at the hands of the gender-critical movement was at its worst, Amy says.  Another pause.  The more stabilised I got, the less they could control me.  And they try to control you.  That's where the struggle started.  It's harder for you to see things and process things when you're working to pay your bills and survive.  End quote.  There was also a lot of covering up for abusers.  In fact, it seems that the whole topic of female-led abuse was deemed off-limits, seemingly because it challenged the myth of the trans predator, or as the article states, quote, \"'Amy, herself a survivor of sexual violence perpetuated by a woman, wanted this issue to be part of the discussion, but she was repeatedly shut  down.'\".  When I talked about it to any gender-critical feminist, they would downplay it and say, well, it's not as bad as with men, or we want to focus on men, she says.  The gender-critical movement, Amy says, is covering for abuse.  I call them the matriarchy.  They cover for abuse of women, right and left, no matter what it is.  They won't let lesbians discuss issues that matter to us.  Like, that's a lesbian community issue, and they get so defensive and mad when you try to talk about it.  It's like women can do no wrong.  Basically, they wrote us into this thing just to use us, so they could say, we've got lesbians on our side, and then they're hurting  us.\".  Now, the article also goes on to discuss said group's association with fascism and conservative Christianity, something that's been covered extensively on this channel, though I would suggest you go read the original article.  I don't want to quote too much of it, as that would be unfair to Vic.  However, I did want to bring this news to you, as well as discuss some things that have happened since the article, and my thoughts on how to proceed.  Starting with the way in which Julie Bindle came forward and declared herself as the person who groomed Dias at the start, going so fast to try and get her to move to the UK so Dias could be controlled easier.  Now of course, she does this in the most mocking fashion, in line with what we've come to expect from many abusers.  However, what's really interesting is that she's begun throwing around threats of legal action, in spite of the fact that the article never names who it's talking about.  My bet would have split between professional abuser Julia Long and stalker Venice Allen.  So it's not like.  you can read the article and go, that's Julia Bindle.  So it would be an interesting case to see go to court.  Of course, we have \u00a31,989 and 78 pence in the anti-trans SLAP fund, though I doubt it'll ever make it that far, though it's worth noting in case it does.  Fact is, all this comes out during a time where things continue to seemingly get worse for trans people in the UK thanks to the rhetoric created by the gender-critical cult.  Liz Truss, Tory MP and current Minister for Women and Equalities, has made a series of threats of legislative violence towards the trans community in line with gender-critical doctrine.  In actions that mirror fascist groups. ",
