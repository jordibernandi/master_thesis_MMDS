Previously, we've taken a look at her takes on The Lord of the Rings, and then on a book, which was actually not a book, it was a movie, and she didn't even bother to figure that out, about spiders on the moon, and how NASA's always doing spider things in space.  This one's a little different.  It's not a book, it's not a movie.  In fact, it's not a typical category of fiction at all.  It's a YouTube advertisement.  And Gina doesn't really seem to understand it at all, but she's very concerned about it. ",

The Satanic Temple or the Church of Satan?  That's about all I could think of.  So at this point, just a few seconds into Gina's video, I was already hooked.  I had to know who was behind this. ",

Like the fact that they go on dates in an empty football stadium, an empty gym, an empty movie theater.  They steal a bunch of toilet paper and laugh about it.  They take a selfie in front of a literal dumpster fire.  They watch a bunch of big-ass meteors flying towards the city and Satan says, I just don't want this year to end.
