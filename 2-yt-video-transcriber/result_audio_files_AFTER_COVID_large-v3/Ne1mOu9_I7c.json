            "text": "Good morning, friends.  Stephen Benoon with Israeli News Live and Benoon Institute of Biblical Research.  And I really, friends, I need to discuss with you something that is troubling me to the core.  And that is this false prosperity or return.  There's going to be this great movement.  It's going to be a great economic boom.  And there's going to be a revival, false revival prophecies in the midst of what we know.  coming cataclysmic disaster man-made natural everything you can imagine.  totally the opposite of what they're prophesying about.  and although there's going to be this Silk Road initiative and although yes we know there's going to be a Antichrist that's gonna rise up in Jerusalem, declaring that he's the Messiah and will do great miracles, great exploits, but this is not Jesus Christ.  This is a false Messiah, an antichrist figure.  And so yes, there will be that little fake side there, but it's not of God in the first place.  But you know, my wife actually mentioned to me that it reminded her of Jeremiah the prophet.  And immediately, I thought of Hananiah, the false prophet of that day.  And then I sit there and as I look at this, I go back and I think to myself, you have like Jonathan Cahn doing his return conference in September and actually planned it and everything when this whole pandemic began.  as if he already had inside knowledge that he'd be able to pull it off in September.  You've got many ministers, Paul Begley as well, telling everybody everything's gonna be great.  Don't worry about it.  You ain't gotta fear.  Everything's gonna work out just right.  And we're just gonna have this for a little bit of time.  A year, two years, whatever the case may be.  Well, let me read to you from Jeremiah, right?  Jeremiah chapter 28, in the fifth month of that same year, the fourth year, early in the reign of Zedekiah, king of Judah, the prophet Hananiah, son of Azur, who was from Gibeon, said to me in the house of the Lord, in the presence of the priests and all the people, this is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says.  I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.  Within two years, I'll bring back to this place all the articles of the Lord's house.  The Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, removed from here and took to Babylon.  I will also bring back to this place Jochanan and Jochaim, king of Judah and all other exiles from Judah who went into Babylon.  declares the Lord for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.  now before I continue.  let me point out the fact that he is called a prophet of the Lord.  okay Hananiah son of Azar.  right he is.  it says in there about him that he was a prophet.  But then what do we have?  We have Jeremiah.  We get into verse five.  Then the prophet Jeremiah replied to the prophet Hananiah before the priests and all the people who were standing in the house of the Lord.  He said, amen, may the Lord do so.  May the Lord fulfill the words you have prophesied by bringing the articles of the Lord's house and all the exiles back to this place from Babylon.  Nevertheless, Listen to what I have to say in your hearing and the hearing of the people.  So Jeremiah, yeah, he would love to see that these things were to happen.  It's not that he was against these things that they would come to pass but he knows that's not what the the word of the lord was.  so he goes on from early times.  the prophets who preceded you and me have prophesied war disaster and plague against many countries and great kingdoms.  the prop but the prophet who prophesies peace will be recognized all as one truly sent by the lord only only if this prediction comes true.  Then the prophet Hananiah took the yoke off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, broke it and said before all the people, this is what the Lord says, in the same way will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, off the neck of all the nations.  Within two years, at this, the prophet Jeremiah went on his way, and after the prophet Hananiah had broken the yoke off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, go and tell Hananiah, this is what the Lord says, you have broken a wooden yoke, but in its place you will get a yoke of iron.  This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel says, I will put an iron yoke on the necks of all these nations to make them serve Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, and they will serve him.  I will even give him control over the wild animals.  Then the prophet Jeremiah said to Hananiah the prophet, listen Hananiah, the Lord has not sent you yet.  you have persuaded this nation to trust in lies.  Therefore, this is what the Lord says.  I am about to remove you from the face of the earth.  This is the very year you are going to die because you have preached rebellion against the Lord.  And in the seventh month of that same year, Hananiah the prophet died.  Friends, I mean, if you don't recognize the handwriting on the wall, if you don't see what ministers are doing, and you'll find it.  It's so obvious.  It is Zionist pastors, pro-Zionist, Zionist.  These ministers are all looking at a great revival coming.  They're preparing you for the Antichrist is what they're preparing you for.  So these ministers today that are talking about all these things, these are your Hananiahs of today.  Judgment is coming, friends.  A lot of this is their own man-made judgment because they want to bring the people under bondage.  The beast kingdom, the Nephilim race, the wounded head of the serpent, Remember the prophecy in Genesis about the woman's seed that he would bruise the head of the serpent.  And then later we find out in Revelation that the deadly wound of that beast was healed.  And when Christ came, he wounded the head of the serpent by revealing to you the Pharisaic domination that was going on in Jerusalem.  And then came the destruction of the second temple at that time in 70 AD.  As Jesus prophesied that it would happen, not one stone would be left upon another.  And yet... Everybody's talking about, especially the Zionist movement, oh, we're going to have a third temple.  It's going to be great.  There's going to be a revival in the land.  And oh, and by the way, you got to repent for the destruction of the temple in 70 AD.  We got to repent because this was a sin against the Jewish people.  Nonsense.  If you believe Jesus Christ to be your savior, he's the one that prophesied.  it would be destroyed because they had rejected the Messiah.  And so how could you go against his words?  And yet Jesus prophesied all these things would happen.  And he even prophesied that you would take and you'd go back to it again as a dog returns to his vomit.  But that's not even the prophecy I'm talking about.  But he promised how that this was going to happen.  And yet ministers go right along with this.  And they go right along with the Jewish people saying they got to repent.  You got people like Shapira and those, oh, we got to repent for the ninth of Av, and Mark Bills, got to repent for the ninth of Av.  If you repent for the ninth of Av, it's like spitting in the face of Jesus Christ himself when he told you what would happen as a result.  Ye are the temple.  We, the people, are the temple.  Most high dwelleth not in a temple made by hands.  I know it's short.  I trust.  it's a blessing to you.  And we really do need your help as well in keeping this ministry going.  So please support the work we're doing here.  If you want the truth, if you don't want the truth, if you want the lies, go right ahead and go with the Zionist agenda.  We were there at one time too.  And believe me, very much a regret.  because so many people were misled as a result of the things that I've taught.  So I'm going back slowly but surely and try to undo the damages have been done by teaching you the truth of what the Hebrew scriptures really say and the fulfillment thereof.  So much of it was fulfilled 2000 years ago.  But if you want to stand with us, support the work we're doing, visit our website, israelinewslive.org.  You can donate online.
