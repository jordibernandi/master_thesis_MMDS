Can you step away from my car?  You can go over there.  I'm a tenant here.  That's good.  Great.  I'm glad to meet you.  Can you go over there?  I'll go over here.  No, I'm asking you to go over there.  You can ask all you want.  I'll respectfully decline.  Okay, I'm going to tell you to go over there.  I'm trying to keep the peace over here.  You guys are over here arguing with me.  The only person that's breaking the peace is you.  I was just giving her a little advice, sir.  I was just giving her a little advice.  Don't bark bullshit directives.  Stupid motherfucker.  Try to bark bullshit directives.  You hear that shit?  Yeah.  She spoke with me first.  I responded, and then he barks bullshit directives.  You know why they do that, right?  Bullshit ass ego?  Yeah, they're ego.  But you know what?  Here's the thing, okay?  When you give somebody respect, you expect respect in return.  When they immediately start barking bullshit orders that are not lawful, you don't need to listen to that bullshit.  These guys are professional extortionists.  That's exactly what they are.  They will extort you out of your money any chance they get.  And if, if for some reason you don't obey, they'll fucking kill you.  They will kill you.  Obey or die.  That's the way they work.  Especially Phoenix PD.  They've killed more people.  They will pull their gun in a second.  They are armed thugs.  This is what they are.  Armed thugs.  This guy's a rookie right here.  He's his first, I don't know, maybe year or two on the job, but... I would not at all, in any way, interfere with their investigation.  And I was not.  However, he still barked bullshit directives, and now he's telling me to do something, which, in my opinion, he's a fucking terrorist.  He is a fucking terrorist.  In my opinion... Hey, man, without getting involved in your investigation, can I get your guys' name and badge number since you're a... Yep, yep.  Failure to identify.  It's against their policy.  You should already know that, right? ",
