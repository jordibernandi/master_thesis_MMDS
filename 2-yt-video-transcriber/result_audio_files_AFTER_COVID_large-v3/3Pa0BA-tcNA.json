            "text": "Most subtwitch streamers per month?  September 2016 to January 21.  Holy shit, Summit coming in hot.  Wow, most subtwitch streamer back in like November 2016 had 6,000 subs, what?  God damn, dude.  Holy fucking shit, this platform has grown.  No Twitch Prime, that's true.  Moon Moon at 5k.  At the number two slot.  Then Bandandy comes in.  Lyric is coming in.  Geek and Sundry is just fucking clapping.  Gee, left and right.  Soda Poppin'.  Getting knocked off the top slot.  Now we're coming into May.  June, July, Dr.  Disrespect, Geek and Sundry, and then out of nowhere, here comes Shroud, ladies and gentlemen!  Oh my god, he's crazy!  Geek and Sundry cannot compete, and out of nowhere, Dr.  Disrespect!  Shroud says, fuck you!  What the fuck?  And god damn it!  Where did this man come from?  That was when I joined Twitch, by the way.  This is the month that I joined Twitch.  Month of March 2018 is when I joined Twitch.  Myth had 45,000 subs.  Ninja had 240,000 subs.  Like, this is when Twitch Prime was unrolled, I assume.  And literally everyone Twitch Primed to Ninja.  Which is fucking insanity.  250... 240,000 subs.  Everyone was getting fucking gifty, boys.  Everyone was getting subby, boys.  Absolute madness.  And then it starts distributing a little bit more evenly because people are like, oh, we shouldn't just be giving Ninja the Twitch Prime, I guess.  Prime was not in 2018?  Wait, Ninja's explosion came from the Twitch Prime, didn't it?  It was when Fortnite had Prime loot?  Is it me or does Shroud's picture look like Pete Buttigieg?  It was the Drake thing?  Oh, Drake and Fortnite, okay.  Did you ever react to Mike Pillowguy proposing martial law and removing-?  wait, no.  Let me talk about it briefly, he's a fucking freak though.  And then out of nowhere, Shroud is coming back!  Holy shit.  Prime was earlier than 2018. um twitch prime was launched in september 2016 as a benefit for amazon prime member.  okay i was wrong.  i i thought like what the reason why he got that was twitch primes though like those are a gigantic chunk of that.  is twitch prime like the big explosion for him was uh twitch prime holy fuck.  and then back and then after that.  what the fuck.  Look at that!  My man went from... Wait, hold on.  This is insanity.  He went just straight dip.  Straight dip from like 200k.  He... He used to tell kids to use their parents' Prime to sub to him?  I mean, I do too.  I mean, the difference is my audience isn't kids, but... September 18, October 18, Ninja is still dominating.  But... Shroud comes back onto the top and then... Oh my god, it's Tfue!  Where is he coming from?  And then Shroud says, fuck you!  I'm the captain of this boat.  February 19, XQCow is now entering the conversation.  Out of nowhere... Kifu and Shroud are at the top slot.  Nick Marks is coming up to the top slot as well.  Of course, Moon Moon with his dedicated audience.  Dr.  Disrespect Montana Black.  The fuck is Montana Black?  He's a German dude?  Goddamn.  Nice.  MontanaBlack says, get on my level.  Lyric is climbing back up.  MoonMoon makes a big play.  And XQCow leads the conversation going forward with 34,000.  Now we enter January 2020.  This is going to be an interesting year.  Summit 1G.  Wait, what the fuck?  Oh, this is Valorant, right?  Valorant blowing out the competition's backs once again.  Gulls shamelessly... Wait, was it Gulls?  or who was the shameless Andy who was just like, Ludwig enters the... Prey enters the arena.  Ninja's back on the marketplace.  Gulls is still in the top.  Oh my god, who is that?  Who is that?  Let's run that back!  Wait, hold on.  Actually, this music sucks for this.  Hold on, hold on, one second.  Hold on, one second, one second, one second.  And he's coming in!  IN OCTOBER!  IN THE MONTH OF OCTOBER!  Oh my god!  It's Athanabi up!  Never mind, it's already over.  For a brief moment in time!  From the top ropes, it's John Cena!  And Faikuno comes out of nowhere!  Wait, what?  Subs as of January said literally once one a second, whatever dude.  Wait, that's not correct though.  I don't know why that 12th of January.  Did I have 35,000 subs on the 12th of January?  No, I didn't stop the steal.  It's not accurate.  They use the Twitch tracker and that has never been accurate for your channel for some reason.  Yeah.  count the votes.  it's fake news dude.  they're counting all the illegal votes and not counting the legal ones.  it's dead people subbing to ludwig.  believe me it's only dead people.  You had that much at the beginning of the month.  You gained 10K after the capital stream.  That's true.  I probably, I probably had like, I think I had like 30.  Yeah, I probably had that much.  I don't know what the fuck. ",
