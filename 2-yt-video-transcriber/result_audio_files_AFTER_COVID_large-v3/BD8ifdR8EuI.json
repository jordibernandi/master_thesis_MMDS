            "text": "What's up, you guys?  Happy New Year!  Kind of.  I honestly don't know what I was expecting.  It's like the old meme goes, New Year, new me.  Mental suffering.  There's so much focus, you know, every January on physical fitness and recommitting ourselves to health, and that's great!  But I think we should also maybe culturally recommit to mental fitness.  critical thinking.  We could probably use more.  A couple of years ago, I had sort of an internal crisis and I did a deep dive into some techniques and methods for improving my thinking.  And so I thought that I would share that with you guys and, you know, we can discuss it and maybe you'll find something useful there.  I feel like this term critical thinking is thrown around a lot.  It actually hurts my soul to see it bastardized for so many not critical thinking things like woo-woo health stuff, threatening a local pizza shop.  Just critical thinking, right?  But for all of the buzziness, there's not really much discussion about what it really is.  Critical thinking isn't just thinking more.  It's not just, you know, being skeptical or questioning authority or considering another perspective.  Critical thinking is a method of evaluating information, and that method is by applying universal intellectual standards.  Very fancy, I know.  Why do we need standards for something as natural as thinking?  Well, because naturally, we're all pretty bad at it.  Very bad, actually.  Just look at human history.  That's in part because we evolved to have two psychological, you know, blind spots.  Our ego and our groupthink.  If we do not actively work to overcome these things, they will rule our thinking.  Before we get into the how-to, I just wanted to share some thoughts on that little gremlin known as the ego.  Our egos have an important psychological function.  They protect us from the general cruelty and awfulness that is the world.  They also trick us.  They convince us that we and the groups that we belong to are right.  Ego defenses allow us to warp reality fairly easily, to lie to ourselves, to bury uncomfortable thoughts and ideas, to excuse our own feelings and failures, but not others, or even to accuse other people of the faults that we see in ourselves.  we are all capable of just tremendous self-deception, which leaves no room for self-doubt, no room for questioning, no room for thinking, hmm, maybe I got this one wrong.  So to be successful critical thinkers, there are two traits that I think are really worth nurturing in ourselves.  The first is humility, you know, being humble, knowing the limits of your own knowledge.  Thinkers with humility aren't scared of saying, I don't know.  And when they're confronted with a challenging thought or idea, the reaction is not anger and defensiveness, but curiosity.  I wonder sometimes if humility hasn't almost become taboo.  It's as if the person is weak or a fence sitter, uninformed or stupid, even a traitor, which is troubling because in my opinion, humility separates people a huge number of thoughtful, intelligent thinkers from the arrogant, overconfident masses.  Secondly, I wanted to spotlight self-awareness.  How can we become more self-aware in our thinking?  There are a couple of things that have helped me.  One is just reflecting on what it is I believe, why I believe it, examining my reasoning, acknowledging assumptions or biases that may have been involved in that process.  Another one is paying attention to our emotions.  I think there's a weird idea that critical thinking and logic and reason are at odds with emotions.  Like to be good thinkers, we need to detach ourselves.  But I would argue that being a good thinker is actually being very in tune with your feelings.  People who lack self-awareness don't understand their feelings.  And so it's very easy for feelings to become beliefs.  I try to ask myself once in a while if I'm having a strong emotional reaction, you know, why am I feeling this way?  Where is this feeling coming from?  In what ways are my emotional reactions affecting my reasoning here?  Not because it's bad necessarily, but because I need to be aware of that relationship.  So critical thinking is applying intellectual standards to our thinking.  So I wanna go through what some of those standards are and some examples of how we can apply them to thought processes that we're having or to conversations that we're having with other people.  Number one is to be clear.  It is really important to be clear and precise about the question that you're asking and the definition of the terms that you're using.  This is like the root of many arguments.  People need to be on the same page if they wanna have a productive conversation.  To be clear, we can ask, how do you define blank?  Can you give me an example?  Can you be more specific about what you mean by that?  Number two, be accurate.  Critical thinking prioritizes truth.  And that means sort of habitually fact checking things with reliable sources of information.  Now the internet, of course, has opened up a huge can of worms about what a reliable source of information is.  That's a whole other thing.  But what I will say is that random internet blogs, informational memes and tweets, even YouTube videos should pretty much never be taken at face value.  Being accurate also means avoiding claims that can't be proven wrong.  Conspiracy theories and horoscopes and even some social justice stuff relies on claims that can't actually be proven wrong.  In order to really validate a claim and prove it right, we also need to have a way to prove it wrong.  So to be accurate, ask, what kind of evidence would it take to change my beliefs about this claim?  Can I trust this source of information?  and why.  The third standard is to be reasonable.  Reason is applying logic and internal consistency to our beliefs.  Like math, but for ideas.  Honestly, I don't know why this isn't a required course in high schools.  A side note about this is that just like critical thinking, Logic is also bastardized sometimes.  People who consider themselves very rational and use the veneer of logic to dismiss people's personal experiences or people's emotions.  Emotions and logic are not enemies.  They are two sides of the same coin, our minds.  I would argue we need both.  We need logic and we need emotions.  Pure logic and pure feelings are not helpful on their own.  End side note.  Reason is particularly important to critical thinking because it's one of the main tools that we have to reign in magical thinking.  Things like pseudoscience or indoctrination, superstition, media manipulation.  To be reasonable, we can ask ourselves, Is my logic sound?  Do my conclusions follow from my premises and the evidence that's available?  Are there hypocrisies or double standards or fallacies in my reasoning?  Number four, be relevant.  If you've ever been in an exciting or heated conversation with someone, you know how easy it is for things to sort of go off topic.  Suddenly, we're not trying to answer one question, we're trying to answer 50 different questions that are all kind of different.  We can stay relevant by asking, what does A have to do with B?  Can you explain the connection between your question and the topic we were originally discussing?  Number five, consider multiple viewpoints.  Yes, we should make it standard practice to consider multiple points of view and to know the weaknesses and strengths of each of those viewpoints.  To do this, we can ask ourselves, what relevant points of view have I maybe ignored so far?  Am I sympathetically representing those viewpoints?  Have I entertained opposing viewpoints in good faith or just to find the flaws in them?  The last standard I wanted to bring to your guys' attention is to be thorough.  We should try our best to avoid all or none black or white sort of arguments.  Life is complicated, so we have to honor and meet that complexity rather than... you know stuffing it away and pretending that it's very a really simple issue actually.  so to be thorough we can ask ourselves in what ways did i oversimplify this issue?  how am i dealing with the complexities that are inherent in this problem?  all right guys that's what i got for you today.  i hesitated to make this video for a long time because i feel like it's sort of abstract and heady and it's just nerd shit but i wanted it to be on my channel.  so There is actually like a whole other level of this stuff.  There's more advanced methods and techniques of critical thinking.  So if that's something that's of interest, maybe I'll make it in the future.  I love you guys.  I hope you're staying safe out there.  And I will see you next time.  Poppy, come say bye.  Say bye.  Say bye. ",
