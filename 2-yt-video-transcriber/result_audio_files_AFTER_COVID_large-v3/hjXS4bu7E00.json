            "text": "Now, I begin this video with a sense of maybe trepidation, because Liberty Hangout is dying.  Look at these video views.  19K, 56K, 50K, 56K.  Even the BLM protests, Atlanta, 78K.  This isn't a flex or anything like that, but like... That's less than what I've been getting for my daily uploads.  Now, the reason this is funny to me is because the Liberty Hangout has experienced one of the most severe bubbles in popularity I have ever seen in my fucking life.  I have never seen a bubble pop this hard.  Just a big spike in attention and then... Now, it could end up that the attention peaks again.  You know, that's entirely conceivable.  They have like this big spike and things have leveled out significantly.  But I think ultimately, and this is one of the lessons right-leaning creators are going to need to internalize, it's that conservatives don't actually give a fuck about any of you.  When conservatives... go online to take a look at their epic liberal dunkage shit, or whatever, they really don't give a fuck about who's delivering that information to you.  Because they have A, no standards, and B, you're all very unimpressive.  You have to be, because if you were impressive people, you would be left-leaning.  Um, the, the funny thing about this is, is that now for all of their, um, for, for all their bluster and relevance just a few months ago, um, they are just like another channel and they are trying to diversify.  to, I assume, capture back a little bit of their previous success.  We only have to go four months ago to find a video with nearly a million views, but hey, that's just how it works sometimes.  Caitlin Bennett's biggest hits are her going to college campuses and acting like a fucking moron to college students, to 19-year-olds who still somehow know more than her.  And you know what?  God bless her.  But, oh, here's, oh, look, here's Hunter Avalon.  They put lipstick on him.  Very nice.  And... Now they're doing a little bit more.  First of all, they can't do that because of coronavirus.  So Caitlin Bennett's channel might, in part, coronavirus might have actually hurt Caitlin Bennett significantly more than it did the average political interlocutor because now she can't go to college campuses and annoy people.  So thank you, Comrade Corona.  Thank you, President Xi, for air striking America with your Corona missiles.  Very nicely done, sir.  So now they're doing like, you know, basically just React Andy content.  But when channels sync like this, they get a little bit desperate.  And I came across this video.  And this video is... I'm joking about the G stuff, obviously.  Don't clip me.  This video is... one of the saddest attempts at bait I have ever seen in my life.  Also, if the mic quality of this video triggers you, and it does me, you might want to back off for a few minutes. ",

They literally manually adjusted the focus of a camera.  Titties!  Caitlin Bennett, you... As a good Christian, I'm not going to say anymore.  Yeah, they...
