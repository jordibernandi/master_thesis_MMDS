            "text": "The point from which I am compelled to view them is not certainly the most favorable, and yet I cannot contemplate their great deeds with less than admiration.  But such is not the state of the case.  I say it with a sad sense of disparity between us.  I am not included within the pale, glorious anniversary.  Your high independence only reveals the immeasurable distance between us.  The blessings in which you this day rejoice are not enjoyed in common.  The rich inheritance of justice, liberty, prosperity, and independence bequeathed by your fathers is shared by you and not by me.  This 4th of July is yours, not mine.  You may rejoice, but I mourn.  My spirit wearies of such blasphemy.  And how such men can be supported as the standing types and representatives of Jesus Christ.  They call themselves representative of Jesus Christ.  How they do that is a mystery.  Which I leave others to penetrate.  In speaking of the American church, however, let it be distinctly understood that I mean the great mass of religious organizations of our land.  There are exceptions, and I thank God that there are.  Noble men may be found scattered all over these northern states.  of whom Henry Ward Beecher of Brooklyn and Samuel J. May of Syracuse and my esteemed friend the Reverend R. R. Raymond on the platform are shining examples.  And let me say further that upon these men lies the duty to inspire our ranks with high religious faith and zeal and to cheer us on in the great mission of the slave's redemption from his chains.  But one is struck with the difference between the attitude of the American church toward the anti-slavery movement and that occupied by the churches in England toward a similar movement in that country.  There, the church, true to its mission of ameliorating, alleviating, and improving the condition of mankind, came forward promptly.  bound up the wounds of the West Indian slave and restored him to his liberty.  There the question of emancipation was a high religious question.  It was demanded in the name of humanity and according to the laws of the living God.  The Sharps, the Clarkstons, the Wilberforces, the Buxtons, the Birchels, the Nibs were alike famous for their piety and their philanthropy.  The anti-slavery movement there was not an anti-church movement.  For the reason that the church took its full share in prosecuting that movement and the anti-slavery movement in this country will cease to be an anti-church movement when the church of this country shall assume a favorable instead of a hostile position toward the movement.  Americans, he said, your Republican politics, not less than your Republican religion, are fragrantly, flagrantly inconsistent.  You boast of your love of liberty, your superior civilization, and your pure Christianity while the whole political power of the nation is solemnly pledged to support and perpetrate the enslavement of three millions of your countrymen.  You hurl your anathemas at the crown-headed tyrants of Russia and Austria and pride yourselves in the democratic institution while you yourselves consent to be mere tools and bodyguards of the tyrants of Virginia and Carolina.  You invite to your shores fugitives of oppression from abroad, honor them with banquets, greet them with ovations, cheer them, toast them, salute them, protect them, and pour out your money to them like water, but the fugitives of your own land you advertise, hunt, arrest, shoot, and kill.  You glory in your refinement and your universal education, and yet you maintain a system as barbarous and dreadful as ever stained the character of a nation.  You shed tears over fallen hungry and make the sad stories of her wrong the theme of your poets and statesmen and orators till your gallant sons are ready to fly to arms to vindicate her cause against her oppressors.  But in regard to the tens of thousands of wrongs of the American slave, you would enforce the strictest silence.  You're all on fire at the mention of liberty for France or Ireland.  But you're as cold as an iceberg at the thought of liberty for the enslaved of America.  You declare before the world and are understood by the world to declare that you hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal and endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights and that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  And yet you hold securely in a bondage which according to your own Thomas Jefferson is worse than the ages of that which your fathers rose in rebellion to oppose.  A seventh part of the inhabitants of your country enslaved.  What, to the American slave, is your 4th of July?  I answer, a day that reveals to him more than all other days in the year the gross injustice and cruelty to which he is a constant victim.  To him, your celebration is sham, your boasted liberty an unholy license, your national greatness swelling vanity, your sound of rejoicing are empty and heartless, your denuncication of tyrant, brass-fronted impotence, your shout of liberty and equality, hollow mockery, your prayers and hymns, your service and thanksgiving, with all of your religious parade and somnolity, are to him mere bombast, fraud, deception, impiety, hypocrisy, a thin veil to cover up crimes which would disgrace a nation of savages.  There is not a nation on the earth guilty of practices more shocking and bloody than are the people of the United States at this very hour. ",
