            "text": "my name is from german tv at the european cultural channel.  it's a pleasure to be here invited.  please a chairman of the south center.  regarding epic in countries Since independence, where do you see still urgent problems which need urgent solutions?  You mentioned so strongly corruption, but isn't it also a lack of leadership, a lack of commitment to the people?  Yes, that is true.  And really, that's what we have to address.  There is no way in which we can begin to deal with the problems of Africa without leadership and without commitment.  People give the example of the development of the Asian countries.  In Asia, the road will be built.  In Africa, it will not be true.  So, it's true.  Commitment is a word.  And you have to have a commitment to development.  You'll see it.  In Japan, it is that commitment of the government of Japan to development.  Even now.  There are developed countries, but there is a tremendous commitment by the state.  Don't listen to this nonsense that the state should give up the direction of the economy.  It's nonsensical.  And we have so many stupid leaders who think you can develop a country, that somehow you can hand over the development of your country to something called private enterprise, unregulated, Unregulated.  Who has done it?  The Japanese have not done it, the British have not done it, the Germans have not done it.  They will be meeting in Halifax in June.  What for?  To drink tea?  What do you think they are going to do in Halifax?  The big seven are going to meet in Halifax.  To do what?  To discuss how to control the economy.  It's not a meeting of bankers, it's a meeting of presidents and prime ministers on the economy.  And these ignorant people in Africa being deceived, you know, don't leave it to the private sector.  Where is the private sector?  Where is the private sector in Tanzania to which you are going to leave this development of the economy?  Where is it?  It needs nursing.  It needs nursing before you can have it.  Is it?  So you nurse it.  This is what the Asian countries have done.  And they go on nursing it.  So the Japanese did it.  Korea.  Korea, tough.  Tough.  It's only now they're beginning to open up their market.  How do you open up your market to big competitors when you have no power to compete with big competitors?  This is ridiculous.  I mean, it's like, madam, I'm sorry.  You know, in the world, in the world of boxing, In the world of boxing, there are heavyweights, middleweights, flyweights, featherweights.  And although the rules are the same, you put them separately, in separate rings.  The heavyweights in their own ring.  The middleweights in their own ring.  You don't put in the same ring.  a heavy weight and a feather weight.  Never!  Never!  How do you do that?  That is murder, it can't be called a freedom.  But that's what the big seven are telling us to do.  That Germany and Burkina Faso should get in the same ring.  And that is called globalization, freedom, liberalization.  This is nonsense!  This is absolute nonsense.  You protect the weak until they become strong before they can compete.  Always.  This is the rule.  This is the rule everywhere.  But our leaders, even if we tell them that, they dare not argue.  They can't argue.  You can't say no?  So, one, as you say, one is the weakness.  Our own weakness is The internal weaknesses, and really, until we remove the internal weaknesses, we can't begin moving.  The internal weaknesses are not the only problem.  The problem is this pressure from the rich that we should open up our markets for competition.  I'm told we have opened now here for banking, for instance.  Banking.  Now, banking.  Tanzania banking to compete with the European and North American banking?  This is nonsensical.  Can NBC, can NBC, is NBC free to open a branch in New York?  NBC?  Can NBC really open a bank in New York?  So when you are saying, you know, let's be treated equal, are you really saying that this equality will give NBC an opportunity to open a bank in New York?  This is rubbish!  Absolutely rubbish!  So, so these big banks, they come to Tanzania, they come to Tanzania, I'm told they're beginning to come, and then they find the NBC, they're now complaining, they're complaining, the NBC is too big, we can't compete for them.  NBC, big for what northern bank?  What kind of bank is the NBC?  You know, I heard you say, you say these banks, we have to sell them, we have to buy their goods.  Ah!  Now, you know what kind of people we are?  So, I'm sorry, I've answered your question.  But I didn't want to touch that.  I did not want to touch that because that's another area where I once provoked, I don't stop. ",
