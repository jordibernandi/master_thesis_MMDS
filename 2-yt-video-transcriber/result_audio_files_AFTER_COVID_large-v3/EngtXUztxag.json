            "text": "All right.  All right, guys.  I know, I know.  This is crazy.  Listen, listen, listen.  We have to be able to talk to one another.  And to be honest with you, when I watch Nick Fuentes' videos, I agree with like 90% of what he says.  And I think he might be surprised to hear me say that.  Are you surprised to hear him say that?  I don't think that's true.  You don't think that's true?  America first?  Yeah, that's fine.  But I mean, everything that you represent is kind of gross.  Why is it gross?  I mean a man dressing up like a woman in his life activates my disgust emotions in my brain.  Okay, he's honest.  That's why I like me gross.  What would you say if I told you I really honestly believe in your right to feel the way you do and I defend you?  I defend you.  I don't think that everyone, the reason I do this is because I think that the radical LGBT cult is out of control.  But see, the problem is not the radical LGBT, it's the LGBT community.  That's the problem.  Well, I don't identify with that community.  I'm just a gay man.  I think that's in there.  I think that's in there.  Okay.  We're against that.  It's a Christian concept.  It's not a Christian thing.  Okay.  I swear to you.  Hold on.  No, no, no.  Nick's a good guy.  I feel like he's a good guy.  He's a hater.  Listen.  No, leave him alone.  Leave Nick alone.  I really feel like he's willing to have a conversation with someone.  No, listen, Nick.  I just feel like... What we have in common, the person and the second in them to their arms, the freedom of religion, including this, they are not serving me.  I believe in that it's essential.  So what I'm saying is I really believe that we do have a lot in common.  We've got to work together and unite so that we can get President Trump re-elected.  He's our only weapon against the radical agenda.  You're part of that radicalism.  I mean, I'm not a traditionalist for, like, 1990.  I'm a traditionalist for, like, 1790.  My God!  I am in opposition to kind of risking a country that we want to promote.  While there may be overlap in some areas, in critical and foundational and essential areas, there's a contradiction.  That's why... You know, I would never, for example, be with somebody who's for abortion, because abortion... We neither.  I've done videos about people who have abortions.  And I also can't be with somebody who's for the normalization or promotion of homosexuality, gender-bending, or all this kind of degeneracy.  I mean, you can see the country and where we're at today.  The problem is the promulgation of degeneracy, DVC, homosexuality.  And, you know, if you just come around and parade yourself around and say, oh, no, but I'm like a MAGA drag queen.  I am.  It's completely tone deaf.  No, it's not tone deaf.  If this is what MAGA is, count me out.  I am pro-life.  I am pro-Second Amendment, I am First Amendment, and actually, as a drag queen, I stand up and defend your right to disagree with what I'm doing.  And other LGBT radicals don't do that.  So that's why I say, look, obviously, I don't really get your point of view, and you don't get mine.  But I really feel like right now, our one and only weapon to save America, after life, is going to come.  So, okay, we agree on that.  So I say, I think it's disgusting that you have a new platform.  I think it is anti-American.  Anybody's voice is a platform.  And even though I may have watched your videos and thought, okay, I want your voice out there, Nick.  I have a question for you.  Do you believe that I... ",
