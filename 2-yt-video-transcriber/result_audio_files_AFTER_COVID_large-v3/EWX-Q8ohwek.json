Whether that means make better brothers, make better husbands, make better fathers.  A statistic that I bring up is, you know, mass shootings are horrible, right?  Twenty-three of the past 26 mass shootings have something in common, and it's not what the Democrats have been preaching about how they acquired a gun or background checks or anything.  Twenty-three of the past 26 mass shooters come from fatherless homes.  It's a cultural problem that you can't legislate your way out of.  So what we do is we promote masculinity, is what we do.  We promote the family.  So that's our main purpose.  Now, we have members across the world.  We have 22,000 members, probably more now after Joe Biden's advertising. ",
