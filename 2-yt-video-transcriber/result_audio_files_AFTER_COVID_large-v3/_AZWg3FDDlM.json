            "text": "on Donald J. Trump, and I approve this message.  I actually love that ad.  I love that ad on a number of different fronts.  One is it's upbeat, and I think what's important for campaigns leaders, especially if leadership at the national level, you can say what you will about Ronald Reagan or George Bush, but no one could ever say they were or not upbeat.  I mean, Reagan's magic was his optimism, And Bill Clinton's magic was this sort of optimism.  And of course, our guy's magic, of course, was American exceptionalism.  So I think that's important.  I think that's an important element of this ad.  It plays up what some of us would say is a problem for Trump, that he's not nice and that he's not conventional.  But they try to connect him not being a nice guy and not being conventional to him getting things done, which I think is a really, really good part about this ad.  Now, the problem to me with this ad is you have to be coming out of a coma for the last couple of months.  to not understand that that is bullshit.  That what he's talking about, he's done, is complete bullshit.  You got to either be coming out of a coma or getting most of your information from Fox News.  So I think it reinforces what they want to see from him.  So if you're with Trump and a supporter, try to make what we would argue are his negatives or what's problematic about Trump and turns it into a positive.  But at the same time, reinforcing that, him as a strong man.  I think the pillar of his brand, Dan, is that he is a strong man, right?  He's the strong man.  He's the tough guy, which, of course, Republicans put a lot of emphasis on.  I've talked to Republicans in the past, and they said, I don't care about almost anything else.  And this was people working for Bush.  You know, I don't care about almost anything else.  What I care about most in the trait battery is strong leader. ",

In 2008, one of the great successes of our campaign was that we were able to take Barack Obama's relative weakness, his inexperience by traditional definitions, and turn it into a strength, that because he had a different background, different experiences, he could deliver change.  And so what the Trump campaign is trying to do here is they've decided they can't convince anyone that Trump is not an asshole.  So now they have to convince people that his being an asshole is an asset, that you need to be an asshole to take on Washington.  And I think the execution of this ad is not great.  Like the voiceover sounds like a Fox News commercial where they're trying to sell you gold or male virility supplements or something.  But like there is embedded in this a smart strategy that I think Democrats are going to have to watch because if Trump can take his behavior, which has been turning off persuadable voters for several years now and turn that into a strength.  That is how he builds back up to a number that could potentially deliver him a narrow electoral college victory.  I wanted to ask you what you think, based on all the data you're seeing, are the primary message objectives for the Biden campaign and the Trump campaign right now? ",

Biden has a more diverse coalition to try to pull back together, and it's like herding cats.  But I think there is an opportunity now, and I used to call it sort of the Obama moment, where in times like this, Obama would get bigger than sort of the petty and small politics, the partisan politics.  I think there's an opportunity now for Biden to get bigger in this moment, and to look at this injustice as not something that's a problem for black people or brown people, but a problem for America.  Because look, you know, Trump is trying to pull the Nixon playbook law and order.  We look at America, we see cities enveloped in smoke and flame.  We hear sirens in the night.  We see Americans dying on distant battlefields abroad.  We see Americans hating each other, fighting each other, killing each other at home.  Which has been, you know, Southern Strategies has been one of the most successful political strategies ever in American history.  Right, right.  It has worked a lot more than it has failed.  But I think there's an opportunity for those college-educated women in the suburbs to look at what's happening and say, not this time, that this division uh doesn't work doesn't work for us it doesn't work for our future and that we actually have skin in the racism game in a way that's a little different from the past.  other thing that i didn't notice real quickly about this ad is that there were no people of color in any of these images.

I have not seen that.  I mean, I will give them that.  That's ambitious and it's touchy.  Because again, I agree with you.  with their point, which makes me pause.  I agree with it so wholeheartedly.  There are white people in the South who really do think of it as part of their heritage, and they don't buy into the whole treason thing.  They think it's a noble cause.  Now, we can get into the arguments back and forth of how it was not a noble cause, but we're not going to move them on that.

If the goal of this ad is to get Trump to react, to generate virality on the internet that could lead to additional fundraising for the super PAC, I think it's effective.  If the goal... is to persuade voters.  I'd like to see more testing to see whether it works.  Part of the audience we need, at least in states like Wisconsin, is we're going to have to find some people who have either approved of Trump during his presidency or maybe even have voted for him, some of these, you know, the Obama-Trump voters, and get them to our side.  And there has been, anecdotally in a lot of focus groups, a reaction, sort of a backlash to the idea that because they voted for Trump, they are racists.  And so it is an interesting argument.

At the end of that ad, they give voters permission to think differently of Susan Collins, right?  They didn't make her out to be a bad, terrible, evil person who's always in bad and terrible and make the voter think that they're dumb for ever supporting them.  What that ad does is says, she's gotten all this money.  Money's changed her.  So now you should reconsider your vote for her.  So it gives the voter permission structure to change their mind about Susan Collins, which to me is really, really important in persuasion. ",

            "text": "Most of the ads we've looked at have tried to essentially surf the news.  They've been about coronavirus, China, trying to sort of put the campaign spin on what's happening.  And what this ad is doing is what I think is where paid advertising is the most important, which is we know from polling, as you pointed out in 2018, that one of the best arguments against Republicans is that they want to get rid of protections for patients with pre-existing conditions by repealing the ACA.  In this news environment, Sarah Gooding can have 1,000 press conferences every single day for the next three weeks, and you get zero stories written about pre-existing conditions.  When you can't get an important message out to the public through the media, you got to pay to do it.  And so you're going to see a lot more of this because we know one of the challenges that Democrats have is the messages that work both with our base and with the universe of persuadable voters we're targeting are not the ones that are rewarded with retweets and shares on Facebook.  We have to be able to talk about things like the Trump tax cut of last year, cuts to Medicare, getting rid of the ACA.  And that'll never be discussed in an environment where Trump and Facebook sort of dictate the four corners of the conversation.  So I think this is a very smart ad.  My one tiny nitpick, and this is just me, is I hate the footage of Sarah Gideon banging the gavel.  It sort of looks like it's a promo spot for the People's Court.  Other than that, I very much like that ad, and I think you are right.  We are going to see a version of that ad, certainly in every single one of the targeted Senate races, if not all across the country.  Look, we could sit here and analyze ads all day, or we could do something to win this fucking election.  So if you want to adopt a swing state, get involved and organize Donald Trump out of office.  Go to votesaveamerica.com slash adopt and pick a swing state.  I would recommend the state of North Carolina because everyone involved in the production of this YouTube series is on Team North Carolina.  We can beat Donald Trump in North Carolina and elect Cal Cunningham to the Senate and therefore rip the gavel from Mitch McConnell's ghoulish little claws.  Well, Cornell, thanks for joining us here.  I'm sure we will talk to you again as we are inundated with ads over the next many months here.  Thanks so much, Cornell. ",
