            "text": "You called me to pray for this nation.  You called me to this nation before I was even born.  You called me, Lord, to pray for this nation, the United States of America.  You called me to come here, Lord, in 1981, to walk the streets, to travel from state to state.  So here I stand today.  Here I stand to pray with the people, Lord.  You know, I stand to pray with the people, Lord God.  I pray with your people because today while I was in my garden, I sensed terror, catastrophe, death, violence in a very strange and subtle way.  So Yeshua, I come to you today as a prophet that would speak and pray the words of life, the words of light that this This storm that you have shown me will be brought to nothing.  I call to you, Yeshua, Jesus, the Christ.  Lord, I pray for a banishment of every demonic recluse.  I pray for a banishment of every demonic spider.  Everything that would crawl in the crevices.  who are ready to come out, one neighborhood after the other, in New Jersey, in the Bronx, Manhattan, and Lord, even along the sea.  I pray, Lord, today that you would reveal to us your will.  I pray today, Lord, that you would speak.  I am not afraid to speak the word of the Lord to this nation.  I've done it before and I'll do it again.  this honor have the servants of the most high god.  high praises that with a two-edged sword in our hands high praises.  i'm not ashamed to declare that yahweh yahweh the lord god the one who will not listen to mortal man, spoke to my heart and said, can a mere mortal be more powerful than God?  Can a mere mortal stop the plan of God?  Can a mere mortal stop the word of the Lord?  Can a mere mortal stop the very presence of God in a nation that I promised?  Today, Lord, I call to you.  I call to you.  To let the truth be made known, that the enemies of America be revealed and exposed through the summer.  I am yet to pray, I am yet to pray in the name of Christ and declare that the streets shall not be riddled with the blood of martyrs, nor the streets... be soaked with the blood of children, but the streets will be soaked with the blood of Christ Jesus.  That's what I declare, for that blood will speak against the terror forces of this nation.  Lord, I pray today with your people.  I call to you, Lord, because you have shown me New York.  You've shown me New York.  You've shown me Lord how the enemy has once again planned something.  But this time it is completely different.  It is not like 9-11.  There is nothing like it.  This is the most strange infiltration that shall come upon your screens.  It shall come upon you in your movie houses.  It shall come upon the places of comfort and pleasure.  and they shall infiltrate and they shall say we'll even black them out.  we will even cause them to be so terrorized because there is darkness in one section and darkness in another section.  Long Island and Babylon and New York all these regions.  we will blacken it out and then we will cause them to hear and understand that we are in charge.  You will not do this as you plan, but the spirit of the Lord says, even as my prophet prays and gathers the people together and the people pray and make declaration that there is only one God and that eternal God shall destroy the power and the plans of the immortal man.  This day, Lord, I call to you, bring down the forces and the region of New York.  And as we go there, we stand there, declare the will of the Lord and expose the very forces of hell.  I pray today for this nation and I call to you to bring your life and your breath upon us in the name of Yeshua.  I thank you for doing it.  Let's praise him together.  Come on.  Come on, let's praise him.  And so Lord, as you have even started this broadcast, revealing to me the subtlety of the attack that is planned.  This is their prize.  This is their prize possession.  Give us New York again, they say.  So Lord, I go as a prophet to preserve and to pray and to call upon your name.  That you may be glorified in the universities and the colleges.  You may once again be spoken of tenderly.  That Jesus, your name, may be spoken of beautifully.  And I thank you and praise you for doing that today.  We honor you and we bow before the Lord God, Yeshua, today.  Come on, let's bless him.  Let's bless him.  The nations are itching.  The nations are hungry for war.  The nations are crying for war.  Give us blood, they say.  We want blood.  Have you not had enough blood?  Says the Spirit of God.  Blood from children.  And what has happened to my shepherds throughout the earth?  As Ezekiel saw it, and Jeremiah saw it, and as Christ saw it, the shepherds have scattered.  Where are the shepherds?  They have run from the intimidating force that says, give me a man.  As Goliath stood, they stand and they prod.  Barack Obama, come, come and give us a man that we may fight and show you our strength.  But the spirit of the Lord says, I have young men and women 16 year, 17 years old, 22, 25 like David.  And they do not want to hide under the armor of Saul.  God says there is a new way and yet it is an old way.  I am a stone for this generation.  I am the stone for this generation.  that stone is my son.  that stone is the rock Christ Jesus.  and that stone shall be given to the Davids of this generation and they shall break down the force of hell that is crying from Russia from Syria from Iran from all over the world.  crying give us blood give us blood give us blood give us blood.  but the spirit says no there shall be no world war yet For I have yet to show you the manifestation of a rock in the hand of a generation that shall break down the voice of hell.  This is my will.  Look for it, for it is coming, says the Spirit of God.  Spirit of God tells the people watching, why fight and rage against each other?  The shepherds are scattered.  Why, when I stand and I watch my house become a den of thieves again?  Do not tell the people lies.  Do not misrepresent me.  Rumors of war, yes.  But I have yet to give you that which I have kept for last, the glory of God.  that shall cover the earth with knowledge and manifestation as the waters cover the sea.  It is yet to come before I return.  You are the generation that shall defy death.  And there were those that were lost in the battle.  Gregory, a soldier to be multiplied throughout the earth and many others.  The spirit of God says, come to me with tender hearts.  and let my prayer come to pass in John 17.  I pray that they are one as you Father and I are one.  Let the spirit of unity come upon us today and let the fragrance of that unity come before the Lord.  As a sweet, sweet fragrance.  And so we thank you, Lord, for your spirit.  You know what I love about the prophetic is you get so close to the heart of God.  You hear his mind, his thoughts, what he plans to do.  You know, you need this on a regular basis.  And there are millions of viewers all over the world that experience this twice a week, sometimes even more, at my den.  And you can experience it as well.  I would love to have you there.  All you've got to do is go to kim.tv.  We have so much.  We have worship.  We have songs that come from the heart of God, prophetic words about things that have not happened yet.  That's why we say to the people, welcome to the future.  And I want you to experience that.  I look forward to seeing you there. ",
