Now what is very familiar.  is some of the same Secret Service agents, some of the same people at the White House mess, which is where you go.  It's basically like a cafeteria.  Like, if you belong to a summer swim club, you go up and you order a grilled cheese sandwich.  Some of the same people.  And there are so many friendly and familiar faces.  So there's some similarities.  Last week, Brian Deese, the NEC director, which is so funny when I say that out loud, he's brilliant, but I still feel like we're kids.  I know.  We did a briefing together last week.  And before we went out, I looked at him and I said, should we tell Dan and Larry Summers we're doing this?

For example, Jared Bernstein, top economist for Joe Biden, has worked for him for decades, including back during the Obama years.  I heard him talking about how In 2009 and 2010, economists were worried about the unemployment rate getting too low because that might lead to inflation.  Now there's new data, there's new thinking, and the economists are not really worried about full employment leading to inflation.  It's just sort of like not an issue.  You were in meetings then in 2009 about the Recovery Act.  You're in meetings now about President Biden's COVID relief package.

I mean, the beginning of the Obama-Biden administration, the president and vice president weren't out there in supporting gay marriage.  I mean, that is like insane to think about at this point in time, right?  But there has been, you referenced on economic and the approach to economy and economic growth.  I mean, One of the things we've been saying, which is still an adjustment for me to say because of 2009, that the danger is really that the package is too small, right?  And that is reflective of the lessons we've learned.  If we don't do a big package now, then what?  We're going to have fewer people who get to apply for unemployment insurance.  We're not going to have money to reopen schools.  It's just a very, there are certainly lessons learned from the past, substantively on policy too.  I mean, one of the issues we were just talking about, which is a good central one to your heart is China.  And how, you know, in during the Obama Biden administration, there was a view, you know, there was a hesitation to to make the relationship uncomfortable.  Right.  We were very careful about how we talked about every aspect of the relationship.  Nobody wanted anyone to be uncomfortable.  And that was a. bipartisan approach.  And now you have the Biden administration and frankly, many Democrats and Republicans saying that wasn't the right approach.  Things have gotten worse.  They've become more aggressive.  The economic relationship is more problematic and we need to take a different approach.  So it's some of the same players, but some of the benefits is certainly some of the lessons learned on policy issues.  And I'm seeing that Also on communications.  I mean, remember we talked about the health care bill as bending the cost curve.  I still don't know what that means. ",

            "text": "I have so many thoughts on this.  I mean, people ask, what are going to be your markers?  I'm like, what does that even mean?  I mean, it's not, you know, So, I mean, look, I think part of this from President Biden's view is basically the vibe you're sending, right?  Are you open to engaging with people from both parties?  And are you open to engaging?  And that doesn't just mean in Washington, right?  This is like a small little universe.  This is like, are you going to talk to Democrats and Republicans who are elected officials?  Are you going to make an effort to talk to Democrats?  you know, people who didn't vote for you, to, you know, talk to them about what you're going to do on COVID.  So I think part of it is, you know, making sure, and this, he's very focused on this, making sure he's, when he's communicating and using the bully pulpit of the presidency to the degree that still exists, it still exists in the beginning of a presidency, to communicate not through a partisan lens, but to all of the public.  so that they can trust in the information that is coming from the president.  They may disagree.  That's fine.  They can trust in the data that's being presented.  They can trust that he's trying hard for them, right, even if they disagree.  So, you know, it's more about his approach and his commitment.  You know, I feel like all of us have commented during the Trump administration about in moments of crisis, which we will have them.  you know, who the public looked to, who was their moral compass, right?  And, you know, when there's a shooting in a community or at a school, people don't look at that through a partisan lens.  It eventually gets there on, you know, gun safety.  They look at it like they want.  somebody who's sitting in the Oval Office is going to tell them it's going to be okay.  And this is a terrible moment for our country.  And I think what President Biden is trying to do is kind of return the the moral compass and leadership to the White House and certainly to the Oval Office.  So, you know, that's part of his approach. ",

I saw Brian Deese, who you mentioned earlier, did have a call over the weekend with a bipartisan group of senators to talk about President Biden's COVID relief package.  Do you guys feel like there's any any progress getting made?  And I've seen like Mitt Romney, for example, saying he thinks we should maybe break off pieces of the bill and pass that.  Are those compromises on the table in your view? ",

I mean, how it's working is how it should work is how it's working, which is the president puts forward his plan.  He gives a speech.  He says, this is what I'd like to see.  Here's what I've talked to my colleagues.  health and economic team about how we can address the crisis we're facing.  And then let's have a discussion about it.  And that's exactly what we're doing.  So is there an openness for things, the sausage looking different on the other end?  Yeah, absolutely.  I mean, and it probably will, right?  The bill never looks exactly like it looks in the first speech, right?  Right, right.  As you and I both know, but I will also say what's been so interesting maybe about the questioning but even about how some have responded to this on both sides of the aisle is like the notion that Republicans don't want to reopen schools, of course they do, you know, or the notion that Republicans don't want.  the American people to have access to apply for unemployment insurance when we hit the cliff in the middle of March.  Of course they do, or vaccine distribution.  This is not just a democratic issue.  70% of the public, according to polls this weekend, supports it.  So, you know, I think it is, you know, we're gonna have this discussion.  There will be things that look different.  The package will have different components.  But it wasn't designed like he wanted to say, I want to have the two trillion dollar package.  He was like, these are the things that are needed to address the crises we're facing. ",

When I was in Wilmington for one of our events announcing cabinet nominees, he said to me, I hope that none of our nominees are going to get into fights on Twitter.  And I was like, who on earth would that be?  Like, we forced them to be.  So he didn't mean anyone specifically.  But he's been pretty clear to all of us that he's not going to govern by Twitter.  We can be out there tweeting, of course.  It's an important way to communicate with people, journalists especially.  But That's not his vibe.  People can go to sleep at night and not worry something's happening in the middle of the night, that he's not on his phone tweeting in the middle of the night.  That's not going to be what people can expect from this administration. ",
