            "text": "Hello, fellow ordinary struggling Americans.  These are difficult times, I'm told, but our family, even that Tiffany person, wants you to know that we are all in this together.  Oh my god, I can't, I can't.  Okay, okay, let me try it again.  Take 17.  We are all in this together.  Some people I hear are having money troubles.  Yes, apparently that's a thing.  Whether your Chinese patents are yet to pay off or you're having trouble making rent on your Hamptons Beach home with lines at the stores.  Some people's servants are running out of Wagyu beef for their chefs to prepare.  white house gossips tell me that some americans have even lost their little jobs.  i mean i like created 15 million jobs.  for you people.  it seems ungrateful to lose them.  just ask your daddy to surprise you with something new so as you social distance whether it be on your wyoming ranch or private island.  Remember, my daddy ignored COVID to teach all of you a valuable lesson.  Going without, I'm speculating here, builds character.  Whatever that is.  Because we are all in this together.  I just can't.  Oh, that's too funny.  Jared, peel me a grape.  Now. ",
