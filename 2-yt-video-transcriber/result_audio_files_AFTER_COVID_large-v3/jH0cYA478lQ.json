It's the fact that they have an agenda to make sure that he's never questioned at all.  It has nothing to do with whether or not these are biased questions.  They know these are easy questions.  These are questions that any candidate, any politician, especially the president of the United States, should be able to answer.  They just don't want him asked the question to begin with.  It's all about making sure that there is never any accountability for what this man has done to this country, because if he ever starts being held accountable, then he's going to have to answer for the 225,000 deaths that occurred that a recent report stated of which 130 to 210,000 did not have to die.

But there's something in this that that Leslie Stahl, as well as Breonna Taylor, missed.  It is the fact that Donald Trump has completely run his course.  He has nothing new.  He has nothing to offer.  He has no policy decision that he could stand on.  And he is so desperate for a win that he's pulling back all of his greatest hits of 2016.  It's almost like the football player who never got over the fact that they won the championship in high school 30 years ago and they're still wearing the jersey.  No, my friend, that moment has come and gone.  There is nothing relevant to 2020. that took place in 2016.  But that's all he has.  He has no substance.  All he has is an attack.  And because he hasn't been able to successfully attack Hunter Biden, he has defaulted all the way back to lock up Hillary Clinton because of her emails.  And that lock her up chant has gone beyond Hillary Clinton and now is extended to Governor Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan.  Listen in. ",

I've been saying this for quite some time, and I want you to take this in consideration.  It's not just the propaganda that comes from the top down to the bottom, from Donald Trump to Fox News to the people.  It's the demand of the people.  This is something that Orwell didn't account for.  George Orwell in 1984.  We always got the impression that the propaganda would be the people being controlled by Big Brother.  But in this case, Donald Trump was controlled by the people because they have fed this bigotry, this dogma, this, this, uh, uh, this derangement, this political derangement.  Donald Trump has fed it to the point where now the people demand it.  And so Donald Trump had to say, lock her up because the audience demanded it.  And if Donald Trump doesn't give the audience what they are now demanding, then the people, the audience will leave Donald Trump and go find someone else who will.  And so now the monster that Donald Trump and Fox News created and they once controlled has now taken over control of them.  Let's keep being divided against itself. ",

It's not the topics or the questions that are out of bounds.  It's his answers.  And Leslie Stahl pointed that out.  Trump doesn't like to be challenged with fact.  He doesn't like to be told he's being dishonest when he verifiably is.  And he can't answer many simple questions without lying or without changing the subject.  He expects a compliant media to let him get away with it.  But here's the problem.  He's the president of the United States of America. ",

It's the fact that we have to go through this in the first place.  It is the height of absurdity that we are in a place in America that we have to actually dissect and break apart.  The complete and utter absurdity of someone like Donald Trump.  The fact that Donald Trump can have power in this country to begin with.  The fact that he is so malignantly incompetent that he contributed directly to the deaths of 225,000 Americans, 210,000 of which did not have to die.  And yet we still have to play these games of rhetoric and analyses and breaking apart in order to convince people to vote him out of power.  When he should never have been in power in the first place.  How many different ways do we have to break this down?  How many different ways do we have to demonstrate to America that Donald Trump is a megalomaniac, a sociopath who's more concerned about his ego than the well-being of the American people?  How many different ways do we have to do this?  Let me put it this way.  There is not a woman in the world, black, white or other, who could ever get away with the foolishness that Donald Trump got away with.  There's not a black person, man or female or non gender conforming individual who could ever get away with what Donald Trump got away with.  It is only the privilege of a white conservative rich man who can get away with being this grossly incompetent and still ascend to the highest office.  And we have to pretend as though the only way to approach this is by trying to reason and have reason and rationale and logic and dissect his arguments.  When we should not have to be faced with this in the first place.  Can I just make that clear?  We should not have to be dealing with this foolishness from this incompetent schmuck to begin with.  But it's because no matter how incompetent you are, if you are rich, no matter how incompetent you are, if you are a conservative, no matter how incompetent you are, if you are a rich, conservative white man, America has to put up with your incompetence.  America has to put up with your ego.  America has to put up with the number of people that you would kill.  We saw this with George W. Bush.  He took us into an entire war, an entire war and thousands of American troops, hundreds of thousands of Iraqis died.  And we had to negotiate and navigate all of his failures.  We've seen this over and over and over again in history.  So the real question is, is how long will the rest of us who are not wealthy, privileged, white, conservative men have to put up with the destruction and devastation that's caused by wealthy, rich, conservative, white men?  That's the real question.  That's the real point.  And that's what we have to get to the bottom of. ",
