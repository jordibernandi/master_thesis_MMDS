            "text": "This is the Dollamore Daily, and I'm Jesse Dollamore.  So the election's over.  We held our election and Joe Biden has won.  Overwhelmingly defeated Donald Trump.  They are still counting votes all across the country because of the pandemic that Donald Trump has ignored and that failed to address.  Joe Biden, now that he has one, though, is marching forward like any to-be president, like any president-elect should.  He is picking his staff.  He has picked his chief of staff.  He is going about the business of getting ready to be president.  He has named a coronavirus task force, a group of science-minded professionals who will address problems what Donald Trump has given up on.  And overall, Donald Trump has given up.  He has just stopped being president.  He is sulking and whining and sniveling that he lost, and he's just not doing anything.  Not only is the coronavirus spiking everywhere across the country, nearly 150,000 new infections every single day right now.  Not only that, Donald Trump hasn't attended his daily presidential intelligence briefing, a critical element of being president of the United States.  He has not attended that briefing since October.  He is putting all of us in danger because he is a whiny brat.  with his mind on only one thing, especially in the aftermath of his loss.  And that is the grift.  Because even as he's losing, he is making a cash grab.  I've received dozens of emails from Donald Trump and his team, from Laura Trump and Eric Trump and all of the idiots.  trying to get me and millions of other Americans on their mailing list to give them money to ostensibly fund the election lawsuits.  that are to come.  We're going to talk about that.  That's not what it's about, but we shouldn't be surprised by this.  Donald Trump has been on the grift from the beginning when he first ran for president in 2015 saying that he was going to pay for his own campaign.  He didn't need anybody's money.  I'm really rich.  He said, I'm really rich.  I'll show you that in a second.  And then we learned, of course, that wasn't the case.  He didn't self-fund his campaign.  Obviously, we're getting campaign emails begging for money because he's a liar and a grifter and a scamster and a fraudster.  Washington Post just posted an opinion piece by Dana Milbank, and he talks about the grift that continues.  In the article he says this, Trump has used the presidency itself for enrichment, so there's no reason to think an election defeat would stop him.  He has funneled vast amounts of taxpayer dollars and political supporters' funds to his hotels, golf clubs, and various properties around the world.  Over the years, he has used his charity for self-benefit, he has had favorable treatment by foreign governments, and he has had hundreds of millions in debt forgiven by his creditors.  As the Post's Davin Ferretholt wrote last month, Trump's properties have billed taxpayers at least $2.5 million for such things as $7,000 for a dinner.  $6,000 for flowers, $17,000 monthly for a cottage, up to $650 a night for hotel rooms, $1,000 for drinks for the White House staff, and even $3 for drinking water.  It's a grift.  It is a way for Donald Trump to enrich himself.  Because it is unlikely that Donald Trump is actually a billionaire.  If he were, he would release his tax returns and let everybody know that's his nature.  He's a braggart.  But now that he's not being president anymore and trying to fund election lawsuits, he is sending out these emails.  Look at these emails.  This isn't even all of them.  Dozens and dozens and dozens of Trump election fraud emails from he and the nepotistic team.  The idiots he's put in charge.  And they all lead to this website.  The official election defense fund website.  And it's got all the style of Donald Trump.  graphically.  It's a mess.  But it contains this particular fine print at the bottom.  It's a lot of fine print.  And when you zoom in on the fine print, this is what you learn if you read it.  60% of each contribution, first to Save America, up to 5,000 slash 5,000.  Then to Donald John Trump for President's recount account, up to a maximum of 2,800 slash 5,000.  So unless you give them over the maximum, that money is going to Donald Trump's new PAC, which he is going to use to control the agenda and the members of the Republican Party.  The other part of this is 40% of each contribution to the RNC's operating account, up to a maximum of $35,500-$15,000.  And here's where the grift really comes into focus.  Any additional funds, any additional, will go to the Republican National Committee's four deposit in the RNC's legal proceedings account or headquarters account up to a maximum of these amounts.  So the money that they're begging for in the dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens of emails that they're sending out to millions of Americans, their own supporters, all that money, unless you're Daddy Warbucks and given over the limit, the money, all of it's going to go to Donald Trump's PAC and just to the general fund of the RNC.  It's not specifically going to fund these lawsuits that they are purportedly going to file.  Because this isn't about actually changing the outcome of the election.  This is about a cash grab for Donald Trump.  And a little bit for the RNC, but moreover for Donald Trump.  Reading from the Washington Post, it's a straight up bait and switch, Paul S. Ryan, the Vice President of Policy and Litigation at Common Cause tells me.  Such email solicitations target small donors, so for the overwhelming majority of people contributing, none of their money will end up in the recount accounts.  or be used for otherwise challenging the election.  Rather, rather, it will be used to extend Trump's influence over the Republican National Committee during the Biden presidency and to build up his leadership pack, which amounts to a slush fund for Trump's personal use.  There is no limit, listen to this part, this is very important, and Donald Trump surely knows, the details and the limitations and the regulations surrounding his fundraising.  This part is important.  There is no limit to how much Donald Trump can pay himself or any member of his family under Save America, Ryan notes.  That is what Donald Trump is trying to do here.  Raise as much money crowdfunding his supporters likely hardworking Americans just trying to get by in this disaster of Donald Trump's pandemic response.  And they're going to be giving him money that he's going to be using to fly around, to pay himself, to pay his family members, just like he's done while he's been president.  The grift continues.  And not only that, Donald Trump is now also looking into starting his own digital media company to compete with Fox.  That will surely be a subscription model of some kind.  The grift continues.  If Donald Trump wasn't a billionaire walking into the presidency, unless he's prosecuted, unless indictments are sought, unless justice is served, he will very likely be a billionaire when he walks out of the presidency.  While millions of Americans suffer and slog through the disaster of a lack of a response to the coronavirus, Donald Trump's going to walk out perfect, richer than he ever was.  That's a problem.  So again, not going to forgive, not going to forget, not going to look the other way while justice isn't done for the good of the country, for unity's sake.  The good of the country will be served when Donald Trump is prosecuted, when justice is done.  As always, I would love to know what you think.  714-576-4054.  Thank you for joining me.
