            "text": "Unless the Lord build the house, they labor in vain.  Unless the Lord build the house, they labor in vain, right?  Do you agree with that?  I do.  You heard what the question I asked him, right?  No, I didn't.  I didn't go up there.  Okay, cool, cool.  What do you think about the Black Lives Matter?  What do you think about that move?  We are free to speak.  What's your personal opinion?  My first opinion is... We think it's garbage.  Yeah.  I believe this, too.  I think it's a market.  All right.  Let's get that scripture one more time.  I think we can agree on one thing.  Let's get that scripture.  Let me show you why we think it's garbage.  Be honest.  Be definite.  of the Psalms, chapter 127, verse 1.  Do you believe in the Bible?  I do.  Okay, cool, cool.  Read that to me.  Except the Lord built the house they labored in vain.  The Black Lives Matter movement was not built on the foundation of the empty Father, the Most High God.  Read, read it again.  Except the Lord, except the Lord build the house, they labor in vain.  They labor in vain.  They're screaming and yelling, doing all these effective works in vain.  Because it's not built on the most high.  Is the most high God about assimilation?  Is he about everybody just being one.  nothing for us?  it's the most i got about that to your knowledge.  everybody coming together and holding hands A lot of the so-called Negroes, Hispanics, they're marching with your people.  And you guys are just, I'm not saying you, I don't know your background.  And the so-called Caucasians are the same ones throwing them in jail, giving them drugs, and murdering them.  But let's read that scripture.  Read that.  32, verse 8.  Let's see what the Most High God is about doing.  One race, one rule of time.  Read.  When the Most High divided to the nations.  He did what?  When the Most High divided to the nations.  The Most High divided to the nations.  Read.  The inheritance.  Right.  When he separated the sons.  When he did what?  When he separated the sons of Adam.  God separated the sons of Adam.  He never dealt with everybody being all one together.  When this is the last stand.  The Most High never been about this.  Read.  He set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel.  According to the number of the children of Israel.  The people that have been slain in the streets, the people that have thrown in their shells, the people that have been oppressed throughout history, the so-called Negroes, Hispanics, and Native Americans, they are the sworn childs of Israel.  They're God's children.  That's why the game is slain in the streets.  They never will prosper until they come back and do God's commandments.  Now, I know you're doing time.  You're doing history.  You're doing what you're called to do.  Maybe you're so-called Caucasian.  Or you were born in America.  I'm born in America.  So you're so-called Caucasian, right?  That's what they teach us and teach your people in school.  Is that, would you find Caucasian in the Bible?  No.  No, so let's find out who you are according to the Bible.  Check this at 20 o'clock in the morning.  Because we are the people for truth.  We're something like Spanish Native Americans.  We are the chosen people of God according to history and according to the Bible.  God is no respecter of persons.  He's not?  He's no respecter of persons.  He can do anything.  anyone can get drafted in.  Where's that in the Bible?  you don't?  you don't gotta quote it to you.  you know the verse does.  god has a chosen.  i'm sorry.  does god have a chosen people?  god doesn't have a choice.  who's the chosen people?  all right say 44 verse 1. let's get out the bible.  Let's get out of here.  We can sit here for hours.  Go back from the Old Testament.  Because the Old Testament is New Testament.  The Old Testament is New Testament.  I understand that.  That's what we got.  Read.  Read.  Read.  Read.  Whom I have chosen!  Whom I have what?  Whom I have chosen!  Whom I have what?  Whom I have chosen!  God has chosen the so-called Negroes, Hispanic, Native Americans, and Choctaws to live here.  He didn't choose the Zidonians, the Edomites, the Philistines, the Ammonites.  He only chose one people.  And you said that he wasn't a respected person.  They said it's 2.5.  They said it's 2.5.  Okay, listen.  We're not going to sit here and argue anymore.  No, I just don't want to dialogue.  You seem like you need to agree to the Bible.  If I'm not allowed to have a relationship with God because I am a Caucasian race... Look, we're gonna get there.  Exodus 2 and 25, because we did make a statement.  God is not a respected person.  Right?  Let's get out of the Bible.  Exodus 2 and 25.  The book of Exodus, chapter 2, verse 25.  And the most high, lift upon the children of Israel.  Lift upon the children of Israel.  And the most high had respect.  He had what?  Had respect.  He had what?  Had respect.  You said he didn't have respect for persons.  The Bible said he.  what?  Had respect.  Respect me.  Unto them.  Unto them.  Now you said you can't have a person.  He has no respect for a person doesn't mean he doesn't respect people.  i thought you said he didn't have respect the person.  yeah he is no respecter of person.  then why is israel the chosen?  people with him?  who is this?  who is the true israel of god?  what did jesus christ come here?  let's get some 50 16. time out right now you got it for you.  i just want to know what i see.  you have a jewish uh depending on your on your Neck there, what is that?  The 12 stones?  That's the breast of a priest, a biblical priest, from the tribe of Levi according to the Bible.  A priest that came from one tribe, yes.  Now, let's get this scripture with you, Psalms 16.  Because this is all new to you, I'm assuming.  But you seem like you're reading the Bible.  Oh, I know a little bit about it, yeah.  But let's get Psalms 16.  Let's get you a book of Psalms.  Because every nation outside of Israel are the nations on the wicked, on the earth.  Right?  I mean, let me finish.  But as thou didst declare my statutes.  God say what you have to do to declare my statutes.  The law of God, the word of God was never given to the Edomites.  That's what the word never given to the Edomites.  That's who you are.  Or that thou shouldst take my covenant.  That thou mayst take God's covenant he gave to the Israelites.  In thy mouth.  You got to put right after this.  In thy mouth.  You're not even allowed to declare the word of God.  because it was given to that laws that God was given to Israel.  Go ahead.  Are we not Jews inwardly?  Are we not grasping into that mind through Jesus Christ?  What verse is that?  It's in the word of God.  I can't use the word the word right now.  But were we not grasping through by Christ after the death and the burial and the resurrection of Jesus Christ.  Are y'all done?  The priest is gonna address you.  You gotta understand that the Bible was written by the Hebrew, it was written by the Hebrew, right?  When you look at the Old Testament, right?  Right.  What language was it translated out?  I believe it had been written in tongues, right?  You mean Romans 15, verse four.  Because don't you understand, sir, When you read the Bible, right, hold on, before every great killing was destroyed, what did the Heavenly Father do?  He set a prophet, right?  So now, we're the same ones that are waking up the people, letting them know that Christ A man of color.  A lot of people say it doesn't matter what color he looks like, but the true identity of the society was his from generation to generation.  That's why he said, when he comes back, every eye shall see him.  Right?  Read that.  Look at the Romans, chapter 15, verse 4.  Come on.  For whatsoever things were written aforetime.  For whatever things were written aforetime in the past.  Come on.  Were written for our learning.  For what?  So a lot of people, they go to church because a lot of people have a zeal for the heavenly Father.  They want to serve God.  But guess what?  You got a lot of preachers and pastors are playing up for people's emotions to make money.  But they're not teaching the truth.  Exactly, so that's why we're here to enlighten you to give you the truth.  Okay, we put a lot because these are the last days brother.  COVID-19 was a curse.  It was a plague from the heavenly father.  Okay, read that.  But can everybody have the truth?  My word is true.  The word is true, right.  So we have to go according as it's written.  Not with our own emotions, not what I feel, not what you feel, but the words of the heavenly Father.  Let him work the truth, but every man a liar.  chapter 8 verse 32. and ye shall know the truth.  what and ye shall know the truth.  so a lot of people can't handle the truth.  that's when we come out with the word.  they want to debate the word.  we're having a simple concord we're not.  we're not arguing with you.  this is a con.  you know a diverse concord that we haven't gotten this word.  okay great and the truth shall make you free.  so what shall make you free?  so now a lot of people are in this world to bondage.  why?  because they're not being taught the truth of the heavenly father.  read that because psalms chapter 119 verse 142 thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness and thy law is the truth and thy law is the truth right.  so when the churches tell you that the laws of god were nailed to the cross you don't have to keep the commandments exactly.  that's a lie right that's a lie.  give me romans 7 verse 1. so everything we're telling you is strictly verbatim from scripture from genesis all the way to revelation.  chapter seven verse one come on.  no you're not what.  no you're not.  no you're not.  come on brethren come on for i speak to them that know the law that what that know the law.  who are the laws of god given to you child?  one face of the night?  two who are the laws of god given to you?  they're given to you through their own prophets.  prophets gave it to us through the particular people.  that was given to you and Jacob and appointed a law in Israel.  The book of Psalms, chapter 147, verse 19.  He showed his word unto Jacob.  So he said he showed his word to Jacob.  So you know the story.  Jacob's name was changed to Israel when he came with the angel, right?  So Jacob brought forth the 12th child of the nation of Israel.  I think my phone has a bit of a battery.  Hopefully it lasts an hour.  There has been a great case of identity.  Probably got like 80%.  Lubian.  african-american.  all these things were given to them.  the bible said that we would be a firewood.  So let me ask you a question.  You have certain movies like Roots, 12 Years as a Slave, Mandingo, right?  Now, according to your understanding, because I've read your two novels, right?  Now, they taught us that so-called Negroes wouldn't enslave you.  Right?  To your understanding, because out of all nations of the earth, the Chinese, the Japanese, the white man, the East Indians, how come only our people are going to be enslaved?  Are you going to be able to respond to that?  You don't know why.  I can't answer that.  But the answer is in the Bible.  So you're going to find out that the Mosai God, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, we were given the laws in the Bible that we pray.  So now you have children.  Do you punish your child because you hate them or because you love them?  Because you love them.  So the same thing with the Heavenly Father.  We were given commandments from Moses to the Israelites.  So we broke those commandments.  So he told Moses, he said, warn the people of Israel.  If they keep my commandments, I will bless them.  If they break my commandments, I'm going to curse them.  Guess what?  We broke the commandments.  And we were cursed.  We were put into slavery.  Okay, read that.  Read that.  Get that.  The book of Exodus, chapter 24, verse 12.  Come on.  And the Lord said unto Moses.  Unto who?  Unto Moses.  Unto Moses.  Now, let's stop there.  Moses was what tribe?  The tribe of Levi, right?  The nation of Israel, right?  Did not Moses grow up in Pharaoh's kingdom?  Now, what color were the original Egyptians?  They were black.  Now, we have some people walk around saying that they're Jewish.  And if you understand anything about the American English language, the suffix I-S-H means what?  Pertaining to.  Like if I ask you what time is it, you say, well, it's 12ish.  You're saying what?  Around 12.  It's around 12.  It's not really 12.  It's around 12.  So they're saying we're not really Jews.  We're taking the custom of the Jews.  Okay, so now we are witnessing identity.  Okay, they stole our identity, but before, but the most high is revealing this knowledge in these last days.  That's why you see, it said what?  In the last days, the knowledge shall increase.  Because a lot of people are not going for what this government is teaching us.  Okay, but for years, A lot of people have been disrespecting God's chosen people.  Even though we were placed, like when you put, back to the thing on punishment, you place your child on punishment, that's still, you still love that child, but they have to finish out their punishment.  So while we were being punished, we were being violated, disrespected by the other nations that are upon the earth.  but the most i got is gonna.  he's gonna recompense that.  okay.  three no disrespect because moses brought the pharaoh's kingdom right and he passed with egyptian right.  so what would i tell you that moses himself had to be a so-called black man.  okay read Come up to me and to the mountain and be there.  And I will give thee taboos of stone and a law and a law and a law.  So we were never given religion.  We were given laws and commandments without people praying.  But I'm going to show them.  I'm going to give you one quick thing.  Give me Deuteronomy 26.  It says he's got to go.  Deuteronomy 28, verse 68.  And I'm going to show you that the Bible prophesied that we would go into slavery because of our disobedience.  Read that.  But because the army, 28 verse 68, and the Lord shall bring thee into Egypt again with ships.  Are you familiar with what Egypt means?  No, I do not.  It means slavery.  It means slavery.  It means bondage.  Read that again.  And the Lord shall bring thee into Egypt again with ships.  Now, why does it say again?  How did the ancient Israelites, how did they go into Egypt?  Jacob and the 70 souls, they walked into Egypt.  Remember?  They walked into Egypt.  We'll read that again.  And the Lord shall bring thee into Egypt again.  A what?  Again.  Again meaning what?  A second time.  Okay, come on.  With ships.  With what?  With ships.  With ships.  So we know that the ancient Egyptians, they walked into Egypt by foot.  But the Bible says that we will go into Egypt a second time, but this time with cargo slave ships.  Okay?  So now when you do history, The only people that went to slavery by wearing farmer's slave ships are the so-called Negroes.  But we were taught that what?  We were taught in school that Africans sold Africans.  That wasn't true.  It was Africans selling black people into slavery.  Because remember in the beginning, they said man was born from the dust of the ground, different shades of brown.  Okay, read on.  By the way, wherever I speak unto thee, thou shalt stand no more again.  Talking about a homeland, when we came in a public station, we have not been able to go.  So when they see a so-called black man, well, if you don't like it, get out of here.  Go home.  But we were brought here by force.  We didn't come here voluntarily on American Airlines or Air Jamaica or anything like that.  We were bought involuntarily.  Okay, come on.  And there you shall be sold.  And what?  There you shall be sold.  And there you shall be sold.  Many of the places that you see were what?  Were auction blocks, okay?  And who were we sold unto?  We were sold unto your people, okay?  Read that again.  And there they shall be sold unto your enemies.  Unto your what?  Unto your enemies.  You see, I don't think that the church, they're doing you an injustice by teaching you wrongfully according to the Bible.  Because now you're not able to embrace the real children of the most high God of the Bible.  So now when you can't accept it, Your past, then you'll be able to understand the future.  There will be a place for you in the kingdom of heaven.  Okay?  There will be a place for you.  You will be the servants under the nation of Israel.  That is due justice.  Okay?  The nations of the Bible were created to serve the nation of Israel.  But we're not going to do the rigor.  We're not going to do like they did us in this kingdom.  Okay?  Rape homosexuals out of the men.  Rape the women.  We're not going to do all that.  We're gonna keep the laws and the commandments of the heavenly Father, okay?  As it is written, we don't... And there, ye shall shout unto your enemies, for bound men and bound women.  A male slave and a female slave, come on.  And no man shall buy you.  No man shall buy me, no man shall save you.  You have Malcolm X, Martin the King, Marcus Garvey, they all tried to do what?  Save the people, but the only one that's going to save them is Christ.  He's going to come back and redeem us out of the hands of our enemies.  So tell your friends, the real children of God are here.  We're here to tell you that the time is near.  America's going to be destroyed to repent.  Come back to the commandments and get in line.  The new world order is going to be under Christ, the so-called black man.  The twelve disciples, everything is going on.  Take care of them.  Nice meeting you, all right? ",
