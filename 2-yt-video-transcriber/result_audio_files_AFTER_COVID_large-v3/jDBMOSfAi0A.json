            "text": "If big business and big government have an idea to fill their pockets at everyone else's expense without anyone understanding what they're up to, they have to give it a complicated new name.  That name is quantitative easing.  You asleep yet?  Well, if you are, here's something that will wake you up.  This idea will debase your earnings, raise the price of everything you buy, and transfer tens of billions of dollars of wealth to the richest people in the country at the expense of everyone else.  Here's the background.  Bank of Canada is the financial agent of the government.  When Trudeau runs massive deficits, it's the Bank of Canada that sells bonds and treasuries into the market so that lenders can lend by purchasing those treasuries and bonds.  That's normal.  It's been happening for years.  It's how it's always been done.  But something very different and unprecedented has began in March when the bank began buying back those same treasuries and bonds from the same people to whom it had sold them in the first place, but at a much higher price.  Now, they told us that the reason they were doing it was just to unjam the seized up credit and capital markets that were all locked up along with the rest of the economy during the early stages of the COVID crisis.  And that made sense.  We couldn't very well have our markets seize in the middle of a pandemic or at any other time.  But happily, markets returned to normal.  Stock markets, bond markets, real estate markets all actually started to hit record highs soon after this began.  So with markets being normal, presumably the Bank of Canada could go back to normal, right?  In fact, this is where it gets very strange.  The bank just kept on buying and buying until it had bought $400 billion worth of mostly government bonds and treasuries, flooding markets with all kinds of new and easy money.  $400 billion is almost equal to the GDP that the economy produced in the time period when all of this money was flooding out.  And the result?  Well, those people who had financial assets saw those assets explode in value.  In fact, the wealthiest... 15 billionaires in Canada saw their net worth rise by 32% between April and October, even while the economy was cratering.  Not only that, these transactions provided a huge opportunity for financial institutions to profit by outsmarting a very dumb transaction by the bank.  The bank was effectively selling low.  and buying back high.  Now imagine if you sold something for $100 at the beginning of the week and bought it back for 105 at the end of the week, well, you'd lose $5.  And then the person on the other end of the transaction would make that $5.  Well, that's what happened here.  But only it was $400 billion of transactions that went back and forth.  And as a result, they made more and our bank, which you and I all own, lost that money on our behalf.  Now, if these people are making all of this money without producing any additional product or service to justify it, then they must be leaving us all worse off.  I mean, if the pie isn't getting any bigger and the Bank of Canada is giving a larger share of it to a smaller and smaller group of people, then everyone else is left with a smaller slice.  So who are those people that are getting the smaller slice and losing out in these complex transactions?  Well, I asked the governor of the Bank of Canada that question.  Here's our exchange. ",

But if the goods and services in the economy have gone down, when a small group of people have seen the amount of money they have go way up, that means that everyone else must ultimately have less.
