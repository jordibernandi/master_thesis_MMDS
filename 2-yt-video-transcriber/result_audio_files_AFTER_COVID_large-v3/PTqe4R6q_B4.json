So I just wanted to bring it by in the box and maybe take it out of the box and show you what's involved.  So I've already cut the tape here.  So let's just open the box.  So as you can see, we have these packing peanuts.  and they really cushion the contents.  So what we're gonna start with is the camera.  So this camera is going to go on top of your workstation and it will record every word that you say and every keystroke that you type And this is actually capable of sensing your heartbeat.  So we'll actually be able to tell what emotion you're experiencing.  And any employee who's having a less than optimal mood experience, what we're going to give you is this bracelet.  And you will receive a serotonin injection automatically packing peanut.  And these will also take records of your DNA so that we can get a comprehensive picture of your DNA history.  And I've got a third one here for you.  There we go.  You're just going to raise up your wrist.  Raise it up.  That's right.  And again, we just want to go right here across the wrist here.  Okay, so those are all attached.  Any questions? ",
