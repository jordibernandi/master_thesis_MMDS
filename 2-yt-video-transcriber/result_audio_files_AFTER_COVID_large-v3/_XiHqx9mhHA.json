Thanks for stopping by.  Today, I have another example of globe deniers that just don't understand the physics.  I've said it before, I'll say it again.  Every single time a person comes up and is denying the existence of the globe, whatever evidence they present shows either their ignorance of the science or or their outright denial of it.  I have yet to see anyone surpass that standard.  I invite anyone out there that believes that the Earth is not a globe to present your absolute best piece of evidence.  Just one should be your best one, and I guarantee you it will be based either in ignorance of the science or the outright denial of it.  Here's an example of a globe denier who, once again, is ignorant of the science.  We've been there before with him.  His name's Todd Peachy.  I don't know if that's his real name, but that's his screen name.  We had an encounter with him before.  This one came across some time ago.  It's been sitting in my outbox for a little while as something maybe to look at.  And we're going to look at it, and it's real obvious to most of you.  where the issue is but we're going to walk through it real quick and show the error.  let's take a look. ",

Your guts feel like they're flying out of your body.  I hate that feeling.  I like that feeling.  Explain why we don't feel a constant change in velocity, which causes acceleration.

            "text": "Okay.  So, the problem he has is he conceded to certain things, and in doing so, he's sealed his own fate.  He concedes that we feel acceleration.  Acceleration, right?  He also says if it's a constant speed, we don't feel it.  He concedes to that.  But, his claim is... If there's a constant change of velocity, that's acceleration, true.  Then we should feel that acceleration when we're going north at 100 miles an hour and east at 1,000 miles per hour at the equator.  I'm going to give you all a second to figure that problem out because it's pretty obvious.  Okay, let's take a look.  Now, acceleration is the change in velocity, right?  So that change can come about by either changing direction or changing speed.  So you can be going at 1,000 miles per hour east.  You suddenly are going 1,005 miles per hour.  That point where you're going from 1,000 to 1,005, that's acceleration.  Or you could be going 1,000 miles per hour east and turn and go 1,000 miles per hour north.  That act of turning is changing your vector, changing your direction, and you feel acceleration during that period of change.  And then once you're going north, you don't feel the acceleration anymore.  That's a change in velocity.  Velocity is both speed and direction.  He mentioned that.  So this is the scenario he has.  I'll do a little drawing here in post.  We're going north at 100 miles per hour.  We are also at the same time going east at 1,000 miles per hour.  According to him, we are constantly changing velocity as if we are stair-stepping in our direction, like we're going a hundred miles an hour north, then we go a thousand miles an hour east, then we go a hundred miles an hour, then a thousand, then a hundred, then a thousand, then a hundred.  That's not how we move.  We're not going.  the hundred miles an hour north and a thousand miles an hour east.  Let's look at the vectors.  Basic Pythagorean theorem here will tell you that our new vector, our actual direction, is this here.  And that, once we go through the equation, is about 1005 miles per hour northeast.  So we're not going a hundred miles an hour north and then changing velocity to a thousand miles per hour east, we are traveling at a thousand and five miles per hour northeast.  That's our direction.  It is a single vector with no change.  How does he not understand that?  Now, he brings that around to the concept of going around a curve with, say, an on-ramp or an off-ramp.  Now let's make a quick circle here.  See, the difference is you could be going at a constant rate of speed.  Say you're just going 20 miles an hour around this curve.  Pick a point on this curve.  At this point, you are going that direction at 20 miles per hour.  At this next point, you are going 20 miles per hour, still the same size of a vector, but the vector's direction has changed.  You are now moving this direction.  at 20 miles per hour.  You have accelerated.  You have changed direction.  You have changed direction.  Unlike the traveling north vector, which you're not changing direction.  You are going in one direction.  That's northeast at 1005 miles per hour.  That is how vector addition works.  Why doesn't he know that?  Is there no one on this planet to even challenge me?  maybe you came by congratulating the last night victory I. ",
