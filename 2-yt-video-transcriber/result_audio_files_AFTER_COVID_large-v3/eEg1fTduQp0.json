            "text": "Both of you are named in an antitrust complaint.  You're being investigated for price fixing and limiting access for legal services in Santa Clara County.  Mr.  Hammond, you've been accused of lowering your prices for certain male clients that give you a benefit in front of temporary private judges.  Do you have a comment on that?  Yes, I'll talk to you later.  Is there a reason you don't want to go on camera?  You're a licensed attorney practicing law in the state of California.  Let's go talk to the sheriff.  Come on.  That's fine.  I'm in a public location.  This is Susan Bassey, and I'm old enough to remember a time when we all read the local newspaper and we watched about three news channels on the TV every night.  We believed in the media, we believed in our courts, and we believed in our law enforcement agencies.  And when I went to college, I paid for college by working for the school newspaper.  And eventually I became a print publisher.  So when I met a group of people on YouTube known as the First Amendment Auditors who were recording the police because they didn't trust them, I also learned that they didn't trust mainstream media.  And I set out to try to understand that a little bit better.  very few reporters these days know how to cover the courts.  they don't understand that in family court people are being forced to represent themselves against another side who can afford a lawyer?  and these people in family courts are losing their children and their homes and they're screaming about the injustice.  in criminal courts people also have to be able to pay a lawyer or a court will appoint one for them but the court appointed lawyers are overworked underpaid and so a lot of the times you have to figure out how to do the work yourself.  you have to learn how to read the court docket.  you have to understand what the bailiffs do.  you have to understand what police officers are going to testify about and what the witnesses are going to say in your case.  and you also have to understand about government attorneys because they are obligated to tell the truth.  but too often these days they cheat They take shortcuts, and they cheat justice, and they put innocent people in jail, and they clog our courts to make business for a lot of judges and a lot of private attorneys.  Evidence that you were given in the Houghton case, do you recall that you were sent evidence, additional information that Valerie Houghton was conspiring with you to get out of her criminal proceedings against... This is Valerie Houghton.  She's a family law attorney.  She's acted as a special master or a private judge.  And she's additionally a marriage and family therapist who is regularly court appointed to represent children or to act in family law cases.  She's quite controversial, and there are some people who will say she did a good job in their case, but there are far more who say that she caused permanent harm to their families and their children.  Valerie Houghton has been being criminally prosecuted since 2016, and just with police officers, you don't see headlines about that in the local paper, and you rarely see the DA discussing why it's taken over four and a half years to prosecute her.  She has continued to work in the family courts representing children while she's been being criminally prosecuted.  She is represented by a private attorney, Chuck Smith.  Chuck Smith asked the victim in her case for a loan through a third party.  This is her husband, Terry Houghton.  He's a real estate agent, and he's represented by the public defender, not Chuck Smith.  We can't quite understand why Terry Houghton would be represented by the public defender or the IDO, meaning he can't afford an attorney when his wife can, and she continues to work and generate money in the courts.  Valerie Houghton is still a controversial attorney.  She's still working, despite her criminal prosecution.  and she's very well connected to several of the area judges and lawyers.  She previously worked for a law firm known as Hogue Fenton, where Judge James Towery came.  She has also worked for Hoover Kripalka.  She attends all the local lunches and dines with judges and police officers who are involved in her case. ",

He's been unable to successfully prosecute this case or even bring it to trial in over four years.  Apparently, Admir Alam has trouble with math and adding up how to prosecute a white-collar crime that is pretty black and white.  Admiral Allen once called me crazy to a lawyer.  That is defamation per se, and little did he know it was actually my lawyer.  But I don't have to like Admiral Allen.  I just have to hold him accountable and provide the transparency that the public has a right to know about how he's prosecuting cases.  And so Admir Allen engaged in prosecutorial misconduct and made a phone call with the victim in this case.  And that information was not shared with Valerie Houghton or her attorneys, which is against the law.  And so I'm going to release that leaked audio recording so that you can hear exactly what Admir Allen had to say. ",

A significant amount of work has been done, and we've gone back and forth via email and initially via phone calls about that.  So I'm not going to go back and forth with you on that.  You want to get this to someone else, then I don't know.  You can go on the Internet and contact the Attorney General's office and do whatever you're going to do.  but that's your prerogative, that's up to you.  I'm merely calling, one, to answer your question regarding what's being done, because I feel like it's been answered in the previous emails, and so I thought I'll break my own rule and just call you and see if that will help explain where we are in the process.  Well, remember, that's not what we're talking about in the criminal case.  In the civil case, Your lawyer has alleged upwards of $10 million of theft.  In the criminal case that was filed before I even got here, the theft that's alleged is $1.4 million.  So we're at a different number because our accountant... again, before my time, had a different figure.  And so those personal expenditures become more of a big deal in the criminal case because we're dealing with a smaller number.  We're not dealing with $10 million or $12 million.  We're dealing with 1.4.  And in that 1.4, if you're talking about for $500,000 of personal expenditures, it does become a big deal because now it's a significant percentage or portion of the total theft that we're alleging.  Does that make sense?  Well, that's... Because that's what the in-house accountant in our office came up with three years ago or four years ago when the case was filed by Charlie Wayne.  That's what was alleged, and that's what his opinion is.  So there's nothing that can be done about that now.  There's a lot of things that were done.  there's a lot and, and, and maybe you recall, maybe you don't, but when we first started talking and there's a lot of, I told you this, there's a lot of things that were done in this case, uh, that are too late to undo as far as certain decisions ",

What's the other guy's name?  But then what's the, what's this, what's the partnership, uh, partnerships attorney?  So James Turner, I talked to him and Turner's opinion was, I had a very long conversation with him.  His opinion was that the McGraths were working hand-in-hand with the Howells, and that what we should have done in the criminal cases, we should have charged the McGraths as well.  And so what we ended up doing was we ended up not doing it that way, and now we're kind of in bed with the McGraths, unfortunately.  But that's neither here nor there. ",

Allen, but for the victim, it's a big deal because we all believe that a prosecutor has the duty to pursue the truth, which means if you misidentify somebody as a victim and you really believe them to be a criminal defendant, that should be addressed, not just given immunity.  Attorneys, much like police officers, have immunity, meaning they can lie in court.  It's called litigation privilege.  but they can't lie under oath but rarely are they disciplined by the state bar or the prosecutors in their county.  this is bradford baugh and he was reportedly the best friend of valerie houghton.  he was also representing the spouse of the victim in the valerie houghton case.  at the same time valerie was stealing money from that victim.  And yet the DA never turned his head to Brad Baugh to find out if he had been conspiring with Ms.  Houghton in that case.  But since the DA doesn't sound very competent when it comes to identifying criminal defendants when those defendants are police officers or attorneys, it's not very surprising.
