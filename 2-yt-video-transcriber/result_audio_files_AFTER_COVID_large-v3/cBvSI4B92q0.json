So just so everyone knows, because of all the situation, the coronavirus, we recorded these ahead of time to make sure that we're able to give you some programs.  They're streamed live.  So these are unique.  Nobody's seen these before, except I have, because I'm in it.  Yes.  And Karina has because she's in it.  Yes.  And Leanne has because she's in it.  Other than that, and the videographer has seen it.  Other than that, nobody, except for the other people, zoo staff that are here, have seen it in the world.  Okay.  Just ask.  Now, okay, question for you all.  And boys and girls, when you have some questions, put them in there, and Corrina's the one, she spends all night going through and answering them all for you.  She'll be watching these as they stream live and going in afterwards as well and answering your questions for you, or trying to, at least.  Yes.  So, we hope.  So, okay, why is this the most unique zoo in the entire world?  Have a guess.  Look behind my shoulder.  Oh, it's because it's at the Ark.  Yes.  And there is no other zoo like this in the world with an Ark in the background, with Noah's Ark in the background.  Okay, second question, where am I at the Aratt Ridge Zoo?  Okay, have a think, where am I?  What place am I at?  I'll give you a hint.  We'll turn the camera around and show you what's written there on the roof.  We are at the Animal Actors Stage.  Here's our studio audience.  Clap.  There it is, our studio audience.  Great.  All right, we're going to go into the Animal Actors Stage.  Okay.  Here we go.

I can't see any other animals around here.  So anyway, this is our new animal actor stage.  And it actually has not been open to the public before.  But as soon as we open back up to the public, this will be open.  And you guys will all be doing presentations on here.  And people are going to be fascinated.  And we've got a lot more animals as well.  We do.  So we've been doing these programs while the Ark and Encounter and Creation Museum are closed to the public.  during this coronavirus situation.  And we pray that we can open soon.  So pray for us and pray for all our staff and all the issues we have to go through.  And you guys look after about 200 animals.  Yep.  Between the Creation Museum and the Ark Encounter.  And we'll be adding more as time goes on.  Yes.  So that is absolutely fantastic.  And we're going to be trying to do these programs at three o'clock every afternoon weekday.  Yes.  But because of the situation out there, we pre-recorded quite a number of them.  It's been a tough day.  I'm starting to get exhausted.  We've been pre-recording these.  And I change my jacket most of the time.  So it looks like it's different days.  See, I try to fool people.  I shouldn't tell them that, should I? ",

Well, boys and girls, if you've got any questions, make sure that you... Let us know what those questions are.  And oh, if you've never seen Buddy Davis' Swamp Man, where he wrestles crocodiles, you need to look at that.  That's a great DVD.  And in Alaska, where he, I don't know what he wrestles up there, bears and all sorts of things.  And there's a great little book for kids by Buddy Davis, When Dragons Hearts Were Good.  So there we are.  Don't forget our 20% off from the Answers in Genesis store.  Matthew 6 promo code while we're closed to the public.  And we're going to do as many Facebook Live programs per day as we can.  Just keep a watch on my Ken Ham Public Facebook site.  Okay, with that, it's great to have Leanne and Karina here and another one of our presenters down there, our studio audience for today.  He has been captivated.  Have you noticed that?  He's been so excited.  All right, and we'll say goodbye now to Methuselah, Jethro, and Rufus.  I'm getting pretty good. ",
