After the New York Post published a shocking story revealing what appeared to be Hunter Biden's emails, admitting that he introduced his then-Vice President father to his Burisma buddies, despite Joe Biden playing dumb, saying that he had no idea about anything that Hunter was involved in, then the big tech giants decided to dump that story down the memory hole.  As soon as it started going viral, Twitter blocked the link and wouldn't let anybody else post it.  This is the error message that I got.  We're sorry we weren't able to send your tweet.  Would you like to retry or save this tweet in drafts?  But I certainly wasn't the only one.  White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany was suspended from Twitter for previously sharing the link before Twitter was able to prevent people from posting it.  They claimed she violated their rules against distributing hacked material.  Even though the emails weren't hacked, they were on an abandoned laptop. ",

Have him go on with someone where he can be challenged rather than going on a town hall where he's going to take questions and he's going to try to avoid them.  So I don't understand it.  I am outraged by this.
