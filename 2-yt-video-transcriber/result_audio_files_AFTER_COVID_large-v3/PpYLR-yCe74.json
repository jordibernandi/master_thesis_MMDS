            "text": "You go to jail.  Touch me.  Touch me.  Touch me.  Touch me.  Touch me.  Wow.  Karen is a trip.  You know, but, you know, they are conditioned to believe they are safe in this country no matter what they do.  And that's the only reason why you see so many confrontations from these people.  They really, truly walk around and believe they are untouchable.  That's why the ones that finally get dealt with by someone out in public, they always look like they're in a state of shock because no one ever prepares them for the retaliation that they face.  So this came out in the New York Post.  Video shows racist woman using N-word in sidewalk confrontation.  This is June 15th, 2020.  Disturbing online footage show a white woman repeatedly using the N-word during a heated confrontation on the street corner in North Carolina.  N-word, the angry woman shouts as she flips the bird.  Touch me, N-word.  You'll go to jail.  Wow.  Wow.  Touch Me.  B, according to the now viral footage posted to Instagram by Aisha Abduz Saber, So this is a 29 year old black woman who told the Post Monday that she was walking to a birthday dinner on a sidewalk with a group, including her boyfriend and his brother, who are also black.  On Saturday in Asheville, North Carolina, when the shocking racist rant began, the woman started screaming, at this Black woman repeatedly, excuse me, N-word, before her boyfriend's brother began to record the encounter on his cell phone, she said.  As you can see, in the first few seconds of the film, she says to me, touch me, N-word, and you'll go to jail.  trying to provoke violence and weaponizing the police department and the justice system against um abduz sabre says in the caption on social media post this is the deep-seated racism that still exist to this day.  Yeah, because she was raised and conditioned to believe anything happens, even if she provokes it, just call the cops.  You know, and people like this are really the ones that really, truly need to be punished by the law.  You go up, you provoke a situation and then insist that the cops will always be on your side.  You know, not when you got the video evidence.  And I sure hope she has a job that will let her go.  And that seems to always be the case.  For some reason, they never think about that when they start these confrontations.  Following the hateful interaction, the bigoted woman was confronted by two white women who had been out in the area protesting police brutality and systematic racism.  F you, N word, the woman says to one of the protesters who got up close to her and told her to effing move.  The clip shows, touch me N-word, the woman continues to say to the protesters.  And you can clearly tell those two women in the video were not black.  Okay, but she was still calling them the N-word.  Another protester then stepped in and tells the hateful woman to get the F out of here as the racist woman repeatedly shout the N-word and gets in the faces of two women, according to the footage.  I am grateful to the protestors who stepped in, but I want people to know that this was a woman who was upset by the presence of black and brown people, who is from Charlotte, North Carolina.  The rage came from nothing else besides racism and hate.  When she initially confronted the woman, I was enraged.  I had to think about so many things in a split second, she said.  Thankfully, I was with a level-headed group who held and talked me down.  This is what the Black woman said.  Abduz Saber said she filed a police report against a woman in the Asheville Police Department.  Well, I hope just from the video, people find out who this woman is and do what's always done on social media.  Find out who she is and make sure her place of employment knows what she's out on the street doing.  Because companies these days, they don't want their clientele, which in many cases are Black.  to have an issue with them because of one racist employee.  It is just so much easier to get rid of these people and keep their clientele.  That's why they won't stick by these kind of folks.  They'll let them go.  Businesses are not going to lose money over a racist employee.  They won't do it.  I haven't seen it yet.  So ladies and gentlemen, please tell me what you think about this woman and the confrontation that she had with people only because she spotted some black people that were walking to a birthday gathering at a restaurant.
