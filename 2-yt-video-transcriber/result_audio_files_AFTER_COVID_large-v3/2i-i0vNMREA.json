And I don't get to actually look past that.  That impacts my everyday life.  I get death threats every single day from people who are listening to this president.  And therefore, I don't have any confidence that even in the sense that he implements something like the First Step Act when it's convenient for him and talks mess about it when it's not, I don't have any confidence that the amount of power has been built actually to get these things done.  I don't fault you for trying to move an agenda.  But I don't think we can take any shortcuts here.  And I certainly don't think we can jump the line.  And you know, it would be one thing if people actually weren't working on this every day.  Imagine what we could do together, Cube, if I had access to a platform like this.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  But I don't have access. ",

So there's been, you know, if anybody wanted to work with me, I've been open, open invitations from day one to work together, make the platform better.  And, you know, nobody has or very few have come out to do that.  So, you know, I'm not going to wait to get nobody's line.  You know, if I feel like I could speak for black people, I'm going to go speak for black people to whoever.  And, you know, you have a plan for Biden win, but what's your plan if Trump wins?  You know, you have to have a plan for either president.  And so in either administration, we can't just go dormant because this is the problem.  I think that's been happening.  You know, we go dormant.  We don't push both parties hard to do what needs to be done, what's right.  And, you know, some people got a whole country to run.  We don't have a whole country to run.  Black people in a bad situation.  We don't have a pot to piss in.  We ain't even really in the damn equation when you really look at it.  We just get to show up and we get to go home.  still broke.  And unless you have capital in America, you're not gonna be really involved in what's going on in America when it comes to running the whole country.  So we gotta look after black people and figure out how to get money in the hands of families in this country into businesses that went down.  We gotta figure out how to get a lot of capital into those hands. ",

            "text": "clip that you just heard was from roland martin's youtube show and he was interviewing ice cube about his contract with black america and the allegation that he was actually working with donald trump and the republicans to get him elected which as we heard is not true.  but that aside that's not really what i want to talk about.  i want to talk about the interaction between Alicia Garza of Black Lives Matter going back and forth with Ice Cube.  And what struck me is the arrogance that she had and almost the disdain that she had toward Ice Cube, even though Ice Cube was trying to do something for Black Americans and working in parallel with her.  And you would think that no matter who does it, if you're trying to get something done, it doesn't matter who gets it done.  all that matters is that it gets done.  And if somebody with the notoriety and the charisma and the fame, such as an entertainer like Ice Cube, who's been doing this for 30 years, that you would applaud him.  But as we know about the arrogance of the gunocracy, and I'm not just talking about the everyday black woman, I'm talking about the gunocracy, the ruling class, who we think is the ruling class, then new black bourgeoisie that is overwhelmingly female now, pushing their agenda, pushing their power, and trying to lock black men out.  And you can see the look on her face, the snide look on her face, like she was better than Ice Cube.  And I'm sure Ice Cube picked up on it.  And I'm sure if it was another venue, there would have been a few street words that came out of his mouth.  And I'm sure if it was back in the day, there probably been more than just a few street words come out of his mouth.  There might have been shall we say, a gentleman's backhand.  But since Ice Cube is older, wiser, and more sophisticated, he contained himself, which is something I probably would have had a hard time doing.  How the hell did she get off?  telling him that he jumped the line and he used this platform to jump ahead of people that have been working on something for 20 years.  And as he said, anybody could have put their two cents in.  Anybody could have come along and actually help out with his platform, with his contract, with his initiative.  Anybody.  But she's mad that he wasn't a utility.  She's mad that he wouldn't, just lend his name and lend his platform and lend his fame so that she could elevate herself.  She and her kind could actually elevate herself.  She's mad that Ice Cube didn't swear his allegiance to the black female gynocracy.  That's what she's really upset about.  She was even licking her lips.  If we had access to your kind of platform, then we could have gone a lot further.  And when she actually mentioned Black Lives Matter and working with them, He said he's willing to work with any grassroots organization that's not beholden to any of the powers that be, which he couldn't say it out loud, but she knew what he meant.  She did.  She knew exactly what he meant.  That's how come he used the word grassroots.  because like I said, he's been listening to us and shout out to Ice Cube for actually using this information.  Because he didn't hesitate when he actually mentioned grassroots.  Because we all know BLM is not grassroots and they're not unbeholden to the powers that be.  George Soros and a few other corporations that have filled the BLM's coffers.  But the sheer audacity is, The way she looked down her nose at him like he was something off the bottom of her shoe.  And she's pissed that a rapper, a gangster rapper who she doesn't like, actually got an audience with the Republicans and actually had parts of his input into the plan.  When she couldn't get phone calls returned, as she said, I can't get a phone call returned.  And he gets the Republicans to come down and meet with him because he's ice motherfucking cute.  And you ain't.  And he built his platform brick by brick out the mud over 30 years.  And you didn't.  Just because you went to college and got a freaking degree, maybe even a master's degree, doesn't mean that you excelled over him.  You didn't.  Which is why he got the call and you didn't.  And you're mad because you don't have access to his platform.  Or basically, you can't use him like a utility for whatever your ends are.  And the snide remark that you said when you told him that if he had worked with you and your folks, he could have gotten a lot further.  I know ice people wanted to say, kiss my ass, which is probably what he said in his head, because I knew the look on his face.  He was about ready to reach through that screen and pop her upside the head.  How dare you?  Roland Martin at least had the temerity to keep her from putting her foot in her mouth, because that neck was getting ready to go.  And she was getting ready to tell him something.  You don't know this man.  You never met this man.  Never even talked to the man before.  You haven't done a tenth of what he's done.  But yet you feel that you're better than he is.  And how dare he, you black male underling, jump the line and take our shine.  How dare you?  This is what we're working with, folks.  This is the black female elite that keeps black men locked out of power by working with others.  These are the ones that retards your boys and keep them in a perpetual state of poverty and almost hopelessness and just begging and trying to scrape it just to grab, just to escape that barrel that they're stuck in, escape that dungeon that they're stuck in.  Black men are tired of being footstools for you people.  At least if we got to go out.  At least if we have to go out.  We'll give them hell before we do.  If we have to give these bastards our lives, we'll give them hell before we do.  And that's what black men are saying.  Get the hell out of the way and let us speak for ourselves.  And what happens, happens.  That's all I got.  Short rant.  I didn't want to stay too long.  But some things just chat my hide.  And trust and believe, that has to chat my hide.  that nose ring up in their nose like anyway.  where i start really cussing this is bgs out and i'll see you guys on the next one peace. ",
