They know they're screwed.  rolling their eyes at their own candidate.  Luckily for you though, Joe, not many people are seeing these gaffes when they happen because you have, they're so unenthused.  Your voters, the Democrat base is so, they're so unenthused that they're not even watching you half the time.  Look at this on your live streams, 247 people watching.  Here's another one, 26 minutes in, 19 people watching.  And you compare that with Trump's live streams, He's getting hundreds of thousands on separate channels, like multiple channels are airing his speeches and his rallies.  And he's getting hundreds of thousands on each of those, millions combined.  And you're getting 19, 26 minutes into a live stream.  So again, it shows that people really, really, really do not like you as their candidate.

And all of this, all of these Biden gaffes, all of these things that are very alarming about his current state, they have everyone worried.  And they have the Dems so worried that they are now trying to back out of the debates with Trump.  From this past week, Joe Biden should not debate President Trump, Clinton's ex-White House spokesman says.  They're literally advising him, saying, look, you shouldn't debate him because it's going to publicly humiliate you And you're screwed.  You are screwed if you debate Trump.  And he is.  Not only is Trump going to mop the floor with him, he's going to look really bad.  He's going to have multiple gaffes.  It's going to be content heaven.  We're going to have multiple episodes for each debate.  I will guarantee it.  Guarantee it.  There's going to be so much to talk about.  And they know this.  They know that this will be the end of Biden and his campaign as they know it.  And in my opinion, I honestly think regardless of what the polls say, I think Trump has a huge leg up in the election.  I don't think Biden stands a chance.  So a lot is riding on his VP pick.  A lot is riding on his VP pick.  So let me know what you guys think in the comments.  What do you think about Biden and his brain and his current state?  What do you think about the future of the DNC?  How do you think Biden is going to match up in November against Trump and in the debates?  Let me know in the comments.  While you're down there, please like this video.
