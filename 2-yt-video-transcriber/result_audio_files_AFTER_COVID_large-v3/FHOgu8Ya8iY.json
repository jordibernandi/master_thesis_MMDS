Daniel 10 and 6, Revelation 1, 14, that Jesus white bread slice.  Stealing the forefront, Satan trying to push to the background.  Stealing the truth, gonna cover the earth like feast of tabernacle campground.  Come against it, be happy, let family be fighting against God.  Stand down.  Yo, Dr.  Twizzlon, see how you still sitting there?  Yo, Dr.  Twizzlon, see why they still buying it?  It's bland and it's tasting twisted.  Okay, you don't see me, but it's beneficial.

I'm a king, I ain't trying to bleed, but my light shine like a diamond ring.  My rhyming skin so fuchsia-rich that for you to get it, you need a time machine.  Platinum crown with the green stones, a sun to call them lima beans.  This burl, right?  I'm melting ice, my gum is dripping pearl, right?  These matching braces with these platinum swirls tight.
