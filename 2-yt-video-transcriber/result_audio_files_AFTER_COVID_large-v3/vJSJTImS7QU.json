But really, it was a prophecy that she had from what's known as an open vision.  And since she was a young child, she has heard clearly from God and had... visions after she was spirit-filled, and dreams, very specific.  She's what's known as a prophetic intercessor, to pray God's kingdom, and God shows her what he wants to do with the world, and she prays it into being.  Carolyn, I am thrilled over the words I personally heard that God showed you in this open vision.  When was the vision?  And tell me about it. ",

And I just heard in my ear, which inside my heart, come here, I want to show you some things.  And immediately I began seeing played across almost like a screen in my mind.  I saw these images start to play and I started to hear his voice.  really clearly about what he was doing.  Uh, it, it really surprised me.  I think this has been, uh, the funnest and probably the longest I've been vision that I've had.  Um, I've had several others, but it was really, uh, I left after it and just was like, wow, that, that need is, it needs to be shared with other people.  I knew it wasn't just for me.  First of all, I saw myself going into, um, I would say I'll call it the courtrooms, but it's really just in front of the father.  Um, And China had really been on my heart.  The Christians in China had been on my heart.  And also just the abuses that happened, especially with sex trafficking and things like that.  And so I just was there to plead.  I was there to supplicate.  I was there to pray.  And out of that, the Lord just began to show me this plan of what he's doing in the world.  And so he came in like the lion of the tribe of Judah, which would be Yeshua.  And he began taking me around to different continents.  Obviously, he loves all of the people in all of the world, but he was really specific on where he took me.  The one of the most profound things was he took me to China to the Great Wall.  And, you know, a lot of people just look at that as a beautiful monument.  But really, that was born on the backs of of slaves that were Christians mostly.  And so he began to just show me like it was like the ground was like a film and I could see all these people pushing up through the film.  And he was like, the Chinese church is getting ready to explode out of that film.  And the persecution that they've been under is getting ready to end.  And so that was like amazing. ",

And so I've heard about her vision with the USS Constitution and how she's seen two different waves hitting it.  Well, the next thing I saw was the Constitution, which is a battleship.  And I saw the glory wave that she said was hitting the ship.  That was the second wave.  And I saw that wave, but what I saw that was different than what she had seen was the ship literally just turned around almost like a 180 angle, like completely turned around.  And then that huge wave just pushed it into a safe port, like a safe harbor.  And that was just to me saying the Lord was getting ready to completely redirect our country back into the direction that he intends for it to go.  And it was going to come into a safe place.  That was pretty neat that he kind of combined what she saw into what I was seeing.  I don't usually have that happen.  So that was really fun.  But I saw the White House, the top of the White House just come off.  And like everything was laid bare.  Everything was exposed down to the basement.  And there are people that were just shocked, like looking up.  And then I saw President Trump come out of there.  And he got down on his hands and knees before the line of the tribe of Judah.  And he was just like in a position of just complete surrender.  But when he got up, it was like his sonship.  He had a crown on, he had a robe on.  And then he turned around and he faced the White House and all of a sudden it's like his clothes changed and he was carrying a bucket and a mop and he looked like a maid.  And then I saw his entire staff and I saw like his cabinet.  They all were dressed the same way, like they were maids.  And I heard the Lord say, it's time to clean house.  It's time to clean house.  So it ended with Israel, which was interesting.  And I love that because I love what he wants to do for Israel and how Yeshua is coming there.  I saw it was very interesting in that it was like the dome of the rock was picked up and moved.  And that didn't really make any sense to me.  But then I saw a shaft of light come down where it was and I saw a cross.  And then I saw the wailing wall and Yeshua was written across the wailing wall. ",

But I felt like that spirit of, if you want to call it Jezebel, or just that spirit of mocking him, like he was done with that.  And that's really what she was exhibiting.  Because a lot of times I don't think when you see a vision, I don't try to really interpret them so much because a lot of times it represents something else.  Like a person in a vision might represent something else.  So I don't try to figure that part out.  But the spirit of it was a mocking spirit.  of her just not responding at all to his presence.
