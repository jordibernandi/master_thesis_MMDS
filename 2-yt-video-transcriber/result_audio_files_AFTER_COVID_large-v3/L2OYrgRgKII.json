He was in the car and the video looked great there but as soon as he stopped out of the car guess he got the reception went bad or something.  but so I'm sorry about the quality of the video but it's the best I can do now.  this is one of the few times I have seen a cop straighten out another cop.  this younger cop comes in and he straightens the old man out.  the old man's a little Henri which we have seen so many times though.  anyway here's the video.

Is this not a public park?  Yeah, you can meet some of those officers.  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  Look, look, look, look.  You need to back off.  You need to back off, okay?  What I'm doing is a constitutionally protected activity, okay?  So if you don't like it, that's tough fucking shit.  Go on.  I'm not bothering you.  You walked up to me.  I did.  Okay, then.  You can move the fuck over.  I'm not moving anywhere.  And I'm going to continue to film.  If you don't like it... Thank you, sir.  Thank you, sir.  I appreciate that.

Somebody got arrested or before the escalation went too high.  Whatever.  However you want to describe it.  But it's also one of the few times I've actually seen a police officer apologize.  It's just like surprised the hell out of me on both of them.  Anyway, hopefully y'all go by.  Check his channel out.  Give him a little support.  This is PNP News.  We are out of here. ",
