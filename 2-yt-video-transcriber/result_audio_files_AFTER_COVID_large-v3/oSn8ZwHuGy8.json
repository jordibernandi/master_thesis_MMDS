            "text": "Hi, I'm Dr.  Dave Janda.  Welcome back to Operation Freedom Briefings.

The goals of that broadcast and this platform and the website, davejanna.com, is to provide you information that bought-off, lamestream, fake media will not touch, will not present.  The question comes up is why?  Why won't they touch it?  Because look, one more time, The bought-off, lamestream, fake media that some people outside that window, still in the People's Republic of Ann Arbor seat, is the mainstream media, is a tentacle of the deep state.  They are the propaganda arm.  They are there to misinform you, disinform you, and to, if you will, run cover for the totalitarians, the globalists, the New World Order folks, the criminal banking syndicate, the deep state, whatever you want to call them.  They're there to run cover for that entity, and they're stripping of your freedoms and liberties.  And with the advent of the alternative media, that's become quite the speed bump for these totalitarian thugs.  So you can join us on the radio show every Sunday, two to five Eastern.  You can join us on this YouTube channel and you can join us at davejanna.com.  The free side, the public side, where we upload information on a regular basis.  Plus there's the subscription side, 30 cents a day.  Biggest bang for the buck.  Extra shows, extra content, extra analysis, extra guests, archives to all of our shows, all available.  Today, I want to focus on why Obama is panicked.  One quick point before we get to that.  Lighting.  There are going to be some lighting issues today.  Why?  Because I'm still in the process of recovering from the surgery for a torn and detached retina.  Now, last week, as you know, was the first week I did a show with a video.  For over a month, I was doing audio only.  Went to the doc this past week.  Good news is the retinas healing.  Hard to tell with that gas bubble still in the eye, but okay.  The retinas healing after they looked at it under the microscope.  But it did come out that I did a video last week of which the powers that be, if you will, were not very happy that I did that.  So knowing full well that I was going to do another video this week, the stipulation was made that I need to turn the intensity of the light down when I'm doing the video.  So, if there are visual issues with lighting, I know, I'm sorry, but it is what it is.  Why Obama's panicked.  Well, number one, on this past Sunday's Operation Freedom radio show, I hosted one of the best investigative journalists in the country, Mary Fanning.  And Mary Fanning presented a timeline that is absolutely critical for you to know now and for what's coming in the future.  And it's about what the real topic is today of our presentation.  What we did is we took that interview from Sunday's show that's available for our subscribers on podcast.  And the subscribers asked that I put that on YouTube.  And that's what we did yesterday.  If you haven't listened to it, you need to.  Because it's what Obama is panicked about.  This is why he's off the rails today.  making phone calls to his, quote, alumni group and the nonsense he was spewing there and what he spewed at this graduation goat rodeo thing he did.  It's about two words why he's panicked.  Illegal surveillance.  And another three words, General Michael Flynn.  Now, I'm not a big one for defense funds, but I have repeatedly donated to General Flynn's Defense Fund.  And I know times are tough, but when you have the ability to do so, even it's a dollar, every dollar that's donated is a hit against the deep state.  MikeFlynnDefenseFund.org.  Or you can just go to DaveJanet.com, and if you go to the right-hand side of the homepage, a little way down, on the right-hand side, there's a link to Mike Flynn Defense Fund.  Hit that.  Even if it's a dollar.  Whatever you can afford.  It's well worth it.  Because it's not only the defense of General Flynn, he's representing every American.  And in defending... Not just his freedom, but your freedom, my freedom, every American's freedom.  Because this is a concerted attack, not just on him, but on every American's freedoms.  And this is why the deep state is so panicked.  They're panicked because General Flynn is gonna be a free man.  Bottom line is he and his family had been political prisoners for almost four years.  Four years.  They never anticipated, the deep state never anticipated, that the truth would come out that we're going to speak about today and had been speaking about for years.  But they never anticipated it would gain traction.  They never anticipated that General Flynn and his family, his phenomenal attorney, Sidney Powell, would have the perseverance, the dedication, the sacrifice, and the courage to keep this going, to relentlessly hold the deep state's feet to the fire of truth and freedom.  And that's what they've been doing.  And that's why they're all desperate and panicked.  In particular, Obama, Brennan, and Clapper.  The three amigos, the three stooges, of the illegal surveillance.  Remember, we brought this forward on the Operation Freedom Platform on March 19th, 2017. when General McInerney, with the support of Admiral Ace Lyons, brought the information forward that Donald Trump, General Flynn, and tens of thousands of Americans were illegally being surveilled.  Not just through the NSA platform.  Look, that's old news.  Two very good friends of mine, who we have a number of presentations on this platform, Bill Binney and Kirk Wiebe, The two foremost experts, underlying experts in the world in surveillance platforms.  Not some guys who are shooting their mouth off because they think they know something, but they don't have any degrees or experience behind their belts when it comes to surveillance platforms.  But Bill and Kirk created them.  Bill was the technical director of the NSA.  Can't get any higher than that.  And Bill and Kirk left in 2001, the NSA, and became whistleblowers.  And one of the reasons was because they were saying, look, the NSA is abusing that platform and illegally harvesting information, phone calls, emails, internet activities, financial transactions of Americans.  It's unconstitutional.  They paid a price.  Robert Mueller, who was then the director of the FBI... sent agents into their homes with guns drawn to try to shut them up.  Bill and Kirk were talking about that in 2001, 19 years ago.  Yet today, there are people out there that say, oh, the abuse was only on the NSA platform.  It was just with 702s.  Well, that occurred.  But it wasn't just.  It was a tip of the iceberg.  And anyone that ignores the other illegal surveillance that has been occurring is giving a pass to Obama and Brennan and Clapper and the deep state and everyone and anyone associated.  No.  We need to hold the people at the NSA responsible that we're abusing that platform.  We've always said that.  Bill and Kirk put their lives on the line 19 years ago on that, and they still do today.  But as Bill and Kirk have stated, and if you want to hear them directly, go on this YouTube channel to the very top featured interview, where Bill and Kirk speak about the fact that, yeah, there are other illegal surveillance platforms, so-called parallel platforms.  where when you're digging up information on people, there is no reporting system internally in that system.  And that these parallel platforms, one of which is called the hammer, has been used to harvest information to coerce and blackmail and control American citizens, including individuals in our government.  That's why Obama is panicked.  Because finally, these illegal surveillance platforms outside of the NSA platform have gained traction.  And the data, as it's been declassified, is coming forward.  And General McInerney and Admiral Lyons had the courage on March 19, 2017 to come on an Operation Freedom radio show and give everybody a three and a half, three plus year heads up.  This came out from Greg Jarrett recently.  Obama knew details of wiretap Flynn phone calls.  Surprising top Department of Justice officials in a meeting with Biden declassified documents show.  President Obama was aware of the details of then-incoming National Security Advisor Michael Flynn's intercepted December 2016 phone calls with then-Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak, apparently surprising then-Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates on January 5, 2017, when President Obama spoke about it at a meeting at the White House.  This, according to documents released on May 7th, 2020, as exhibits to the government's motion to dismiss the Flynn case.  Now you should ask yourself, Sally Yates, she is not a Girl Scout.  She was involved with the National Security Division of the Department of Justice.  As Mary Fanning has pointed out, when she got there, Sally Yates, in April of 2015, one of the first things she did is she blocked the Inspector General Michael Horwitz from access on a permanent basis to the National Security Division of the Department of Justice and what they were up to.  Boo.  Sally Yates is not a Girl Scout.  She's a swamp rat, extraordinaire.  So this is what Greg Jarrett said, that surprising Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates, surprised, shocked, that Obama was talking about this conversation between General Flynn and the Russian ambassador, Kislyak, which was purely legal, And absolutely legal because General Flynn, this was in the transition period at that time, December 2016, was the incoming national security advisor to Donald Trump.  Why would Yates, this swamp rat, be shocked by that?  Surprised by that?  Have her breath taken away by that?  To the point where she couldn't even concentrate on the rest of the conversation she was having with Obama.  Why?  Let's get to it.  Obama's unexpectedly intimate knowledge of the details of Flynn's calls, which the FBI acknowledged at the time were not criminal or even improper, raised eyebrows because of his own history with Flynn and because top FBI officials secretly discussed whether their goal was to get Flynn fired when they interviewed him in the White House on January 24, 2017.  On January 5, 2017, Yates attended an Oval Office meeting with then FBI Director James Comey, then Vice President Joe Biden, then CIA Director John Brennan, then Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, according to the newly declassified documents, including a 302 FBI witness report.  They were discussing Russian election interference along with National Security Advisor Susan Rice and other members of the National Security Council.  After the briefing, Obama asked Yates and Comey to, quote, stay behind, end quote.  Whoa, be careful, boys and girl.  And said he had, quote, learned of the information about Flynn, end quote.  How did he learn about that?  How?  We're going to get to that in a minute.  and his conversation with the Russian ambassador about sanctions.  Obama specified that he didn't want any additional information.  Ooh, no, my hands are already dirty.  I don't want more dirt.  Red Jericho's on.  At that point, the documents recently released by the government and declassified showed, quote, Yates had no idea what the president was talking about but figured it out based on the conversation.  Oh, she figured it out, all right.  She knew for a fact that there were no unmaskings of General Flynn's phone call with the Russian ambassador through the NSA.  No, she figured it out, all right, that Obama had gotten that information from an illegal surveillance source.  A parallel platform.  Hammer time.  Quote from the documents.  It was not clear to Yates from where the president first received the information.  She was so surprised by the information she was hearing that she, now remember, this is a swamp rat, not a Girl Scout, that she was having a hard time processing it and listening to the conversation at the same time, end quote.  Yates would later say that she was concerned based on the information and how it was obtained that Flynn would be vulnerable to blackmail.  Obama participated in plot to frame General Flynn, according to Sidney Powell.  This from Zero Hedge.  Former President Barack Obama was in on the plot to frame former National Security Advisor General Michael Flynn according to his lead attorney, Sidney Powell.  According to recently released testimony, President Obama, that I spoke to you about, revealed during an Oval Office meeting weeks before the interview of General Flynn, which occurred on January 24, 2017, the meeting at the White House with his little hench group of totalitarian thugs occurred on January 5, 2017.  At that meeting, he stated he knew about Flynn's phone call with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak, which did surprise swamp rat Sally Yates.  Let's take you through this. ",
