Everybody remembers the hysterical Joe Rogan exchange with Dave Rubin, where Dave Rubin was like, I guess I'm just interested in the post office not existing on a conceptual level.  And Joe being like, dude, what the fuck?  You know?  Again, it was actually a great moment.  It was extremely funny.  It's provided a lot of levity for us.  Part of the reason we just can't do as much Ruben stuff is because Ruben is just... I mean, have you been reading the reviews that have been... Including in The Spectator, which is conservative on his book.  I mean, it's just... The guy is a joke and a jackass.  And, I mean, he's actually comparing bad Amazon reviews to book burnings.  I mean, you know, come on.  Like... But... Joe Rogan doing this to a congressperson, and not only a congressperson, the guy on the right that they think is their guy, they think that this guy is the pop culture answer.  And to politics on the left for young people.  And so this exchange with Joe Rogan and Dan Crenshaw on universal health care is something.  And it does show us.  I mean, the barrier to have national health insurance is because all the power in the world is in capital's hands.  But ideologically, the terrain is really changing.  So let's give this a watch.  And then, Ben, give us your riff on it. ",

And here's why.  You can add a few hundred thousand more people to the nation's population, and it doesn't change the mission of the military.  It doesn't take anything away from them.  But because of the sort of non-rival, this is like an economics term, but the sort of non-rival attribute of these things, it is different, right?  Because there's only a select number of doctors.  And we've already said that once you put price controls in, there's going to be less doctors because doctors will be paid less.  They'll get burned out more.  Then hospitals will be able to, I actually never finished that point.  And the reason price controls reduce supply and the reason we see supply reductions in other countries is because, well, hospitals don't get the same amount of money.  They're not going to invest in that extra ICU bed.  They're not going to buy those extra ventilators.  They're not going to hire those other doctors.  A doctor doesn't want to be a doctor because they don't make the amount of money that they thought they would make.  They're doing extra work because there's more people who now have access to them.  but there's less of them.  so weight lines are huge and they're seeing multiple more patients a day.  doctor burnout increases quite a bit.  that's the quick answer as to why why that happens.  but Does that kind of answer your question?  Not very convincing. ",

And in rural Texas, right, where a lot of these people who vote for Republicans or whatever live, It's even worse.  I mean, like the ratio for doctors, I mean, like the average ratio for doctors in the countries, I don't know, Ben, you might have the numbers better than me, but something like 75 primary care doctors per 100,000 people.  In Texas, it's like low 50s, like low 50s.  So they sit here and act like some kind of free market system, right?  What you would imagine that Texas would have one of the most free market systems in the country.  somehow provides more doctors to more people is absolutely wrong.  Because you don't even have to be like, understand economics, have a deep understanding of economics to understand why.  If you have a small amount of people living in a very large amount of land, right?  you can't make a lot of money off of that population, right?  So that it's going to be very difficult to provide rural health care to folks, right?  So that's why you can't have, you know, a free market system is so bad at providing health care to rural communities, right?  That's why you need some kind of funding that is not just charging people per services, but it's actually just universal, funded by the government, funded by the collective, right?
