            "text": "This is another video from my Film the Police series, highlighting everyday citizens who aren't activists protecting themselves and others using their freedom to record and document the unethical jobs of these blue line order followers.  Mark Passio is the one who turned me on to the fact that cops are order followers, and they make a conscious decision every day to go to work and not think for themselves.  They inflict more violence, torture, theft, and kidnapping on people of this land than any other group.  Yet we're told constantly they're heroes who are just doing their job.  We need more people like this guy from the YouTube channel Official Kushwidaki pulling out their cameras and documenting for the world to see.  This channel isn't a cop-watching or auditing channel, but they seem to understand the law pretty well and bring up some pretty thought-provoking concepts about society and its double standards.  And they're pretty entertaining as well.  As always, links to the original channel and video are in the description.  Go check this channel out, and if you like his content, consider subbing him and let him know Questionable Authority sent you.  The video I'm highlighting today is just Kush and some friends hanging out by his apartment when an order follower comes to inquire about a robbery.  The way they handled this order follower and sent him kicking rocks is absolutely beautiful.  They stood up to him and didn't let him violate their persons or property.  This is one of the best walks of shame I've ever seen.  If you like it as much as I did, let me know with a comment.  And while you do that, don't forget to hit the like button and share this video on all of your social media.  And of course, subscribe to the channel for more content like this. ",

You're serious right now.  But do you just have an idea on your face right now?  Yeah, yeah, I'm serious.  What?  I mean, not many people have red dreads.  Not many people have red.  He doesn't have dreadlocks.  Those aren't even dreads.  I don't have dreads.  Those aren't even dreads.  I can't touch his hair, but show him those aren't even dreads.  These aren't dreads.  They're not dreads.  that's the whole thing.  That's hilarious.  Do you have an idea on you really quick?  My boy's been here for mad hours.  You're coming, accusing him of a crime.  Can he know what he's being accused of?  A robbery.  A robbery.  You're being accused of robbing somebody?  You're being accused of something?  You can't even hang out at your own house anymore?  He wants to see your ID, because you're being accused of robbing someone.  If he sees your ID, he's going to know if you robbed somebody or not.  His ID is going to say, I robbed someone or not.  So you want to see his ID to see if he just robbed someone because he fits the description of red dress.  Okay, I want to join this game.  Okay, I'm a natural redhead.  My tips are red.  Which one of us robbed him?  I have red hair.  His is dyed.  Mine is natural.  What you're saying does not really make any sense.  I'm not talking to you.  I'm talking to him.  Who cares?  You're on my property.  I'm talking... Yes, it is.  It's my property.  You own the apartment complex?  I actually own this apartment, yes.  And the property owner's name... This one right here.  I own this one.  Yes, I actually do.  This isn't your property, right?  Oh, the whole thing, no, but this right here, this is mine, yup.  Yeah, uh-huh.  Can I have your name, man, really quick?  He wants his name.  What do you mean, my name?  Because you probably robbed someone, bro.  You have red hair.  You have red dreads.  You had to.  You have red dreads.  You fit the description of red dreads, bro, so you had to rob someone.  Because you have red dreads.  I don't have dreads, though.  This is crazy.  Is it cool if I just get your name really quick?  Spidey Jones.  Spidey Jones, is that right?  Is that really his hair color?  Like, are you serious right now?  I'm baffled right now.  I know, bro.  You fit the description, bro.  Is there any other description?  What color was the guy's skin? ",
