            "text": "I like to compare what happened in history to what's happening now and see how they parallel.  It's just astounding how often that happens.  If you go back to the last epidemic, and I believe this epidemic actually cost the life of the grandfather of Donald Trump.  So it's something that's very personal, very tied to the president.  In 1918, America suffered the Spanish flu epidemic.  Now, when did the coronavirus epidemic begin?  2019.  So I mean, so that's almost on the nose, the anniversary, almost the 100th anniversary, right?  So then, after the 1918 Spanish flu epidemic, what happened?  In 1919, Adolf Hitler rose to power.  Did you know that?  He joined the German Workers' Party in 1919.  So again, if we just follow it year by year, that would seem that in the year 2020 or 2021, around then, an Antichrist figure will arise.  And I want to point you to the website of the World Economic Forum, and you can see the people who are saying, overtly, leaders of the world saying, let's not waste money.  the coronavirus epidemic, let's grab this opportunity, this short window of time, to do what?  To basically tax people more, control people more, take their freedom away, implement 5G, implement drones, and it's all there mapped out on their diagram.  It's not even conspiracy anymore.  I mean, this is really the antichrist spirit arising.  But you don't see it yet, because just like people didn't know how bad Adolf Hitler was in 1919, you don't know yet how bad these You know, these sinister rulers are and what they're planning.  But they've already advertised what they're doing in the year 2020 at the World Economic Forum.  Most people will not pay any attention to it unless they've watched a video like this.  And even if they have, they'll go, ho-hum, oh well.  And in their pride, they say everything continues as it was before.  This is the problem.  Don't think like that.  Then from the 1920 onwards, we had the roaring 20s.  So I would say that if this pattern holds, what we're looking at is in 2021, we're going to see economic recovery.  Trump's going to win the election, and all of this economic woe was just a prelude.  It's just a prelude.  God always gives a warning and then the actual fulfillment comes.  So I believe there's going to be economic recovery for America.  Trump will take America into its days of justice.  That's why he's there.  That's why God told me to write Trump's unfinished business.  If Trump's not going to be there and if You know, we're just going to see the Antichrist take control of America and the whole world.  Well, then why did the Lord tell me to write Trump's unfinished business?  I believe, not because of my book, but I believe because God said it, that there are still days ahead where we can repent, we can return, and we can restore the goodness of God on the earth.  We can see more of the kingdom of God on the earth.  We're not taking over the earth, but we're going to keep evangelizing and getting more people saved.  So if the pattern holds, we're going to go into around 10 years of economic recovery.  That means that Trump will still be president from now to 2024.  Pence will then become president from 2025 to 2029.  And then in 1929, after the roaring 20s finished, the stock market crash and the Great Depression began.  So if you follow the pattern that means that around 2030 there would be a Great Depression.  That Great Depression lasted for around 10 years before World War II began.  So from 1929 to the start of World War II is 1939.  So again if that pattern holds then you're looking at World War III around 2040.  World War II went for Six years to 1945, World War II ended.  So that would take us to 2046, World War III would end.  And you know what happens next.  Because of World War II and because of the Holocaust, the persecution of the Jews, then you have on November 1947, the declaration by the United Nations Resolution 181, the state of Israel is formally born, formally recognized.  So that would take us to 2048 for Israel to be born again nationally.  So I know that this pattern upsets people because there are people saying the Antichrist is coming now, everything's going to end now.  But if you follow the pandemic, and then you follow the Antichrist figure, and then you follow the prosperity, then you follow the war, and these match, by the way, the four horsemen of the apocalypse.  then that means that we are given about another 28 years before we see the fulfillment of the rebirth, you know, Israel's reborn geographically, but the rebirth of the Jews, recognizing their Messiah.  28 years is not a long time.  I know some people would say, oh, well, it's going to come any time.  It's going to be imminent.  And you could be right.  And I don't have a problem with that.  If you believe that, that's fine.  I'm not saying that this is dogmatically the timeline.  I'm saying that I see a pattern, and patterns are prophetic, especially if they relate to the Bible.  All right?  And there was a great Antichrist figure who came specifically to kill the Jews.  His name is Adolf Hitler.  So... All these events are the things that brought him up, the flu epidemic and then the economic devastation, and then people were ready to give up their control and go mad and blind and brainwashed and just follow Adolf Hitler.  It's not hard now for me to see that people can be so quickly brainwashed and so quickly compliant that people will give up their freedoms.  They'll stay locked down in their home even though the Constitution says they have a right to go out.  They shut down churches and they won't meet anymore, even though the Constitution guarantees the right of assembly for religious purposes.  That's your First Amendment.  And that people give all that up, but Black Lives Matter can protest, destroy businesses, riot, loot, can set buildings on fire.  That's okay.  So obviously this lockdown, from an objective point of view, is at least partly political.  Because it's not objective.  It's not fair.  It doesn't apply to all.  One standard applies to the people who don't vote for the left.  Another standard applies to the people that favor the left.  So that's what I mean that it's political.  They've politicized something that you have a, it seems like, 98 to 99% chance of surviving.  And currently, we don't hear people dying of the regular flu because all of that number has been shifted to the coronavirus.  Each year, hundreds of thousands of people die from the normal flu.  In Australia, in our entire country, how many have died from coronavirus?  Around 200.  So something is being played politically.  I didn't say coronavirus is not real.  Of course it's real.  A virus is real.  But so is the normal flu, and we have to get on with life.  We don't just lock down and we don't give up our freedoms just for a political purpose.  So I think the Trump election has a lot to do with this.  When he does get reelected, I think things are gonna change and things are gonna look up again if we don't fall into the pride of Tyre.  And I think this Beirut blast, is really something that you know.  it's so shocking when you see it.  it's so horrific but it ties back to what happened to tire twice before.  so pay attention.  god is saying i don't want to see pride.  i don't want to see pride.  if you if i allow you to recover out of this and i give you time again don't just go making money.  go and evangelize.  don't just skip church.  get on online church.  Join Discover Church online.  Support the ministry like us and many others who are getting the gospel out offline, online, physically.  When we start traveling again, you know that I'll go and take the gospel to the nations.  Support that because we have a few years left.  Maybe maximum 28 years is not a lot of time.  All right?  Again, that's just one timeline that I'm looking at.  So the glorious ending of this is Israel will recognize her Messiah.  Just like Israel came out of the ashes of World War II, then Israel is going to come out of the ashes of the tribulation and realize we were wrong.  We have snubbed and dishonored our own brother, our own Messiah, Yeshua.  And we accept Him as our Savior, not some other Savior.  Remember that August is First Fruits Month.  We've been doing this for years, I think more than 10 years.  The Bible teaches us to honor the Lord with the first, not the second, not the third, with the first, and certainly not the last.  The Pharisees, however, argued over how much first fruits was exactly.  There were two schools of thought about this.  The school of Shammai said that first fruits should be 1 40th of our yearly income, which is pretty equivalent to one paycheck out of 40 working weeks.  Those who subscribed to the school of Shammai were called the good eye, the good eye.  The school of Hillel said that first fruits should be 1 50th of our income, which is equivalent, nearly equivalent to one paycheck out of 52 weeks in a year.  And this was called the evil eye.  So when Jesus spoke about the good eye and the evil eye in Matthew chapter 6, it suddenly makes sense.  He settled the debate that they were having in Matthew chapter 6 verse 21.  And you know he's talking about giving because he says, he starts off in context, \"...for where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.  The light of the body is the eye.  If therefore thine eye be single, the whole body shall be full of  light.\".  But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness.  If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness.  Those who listened to Jesus that day and understood the argument that the rabbis had had for hundreds of years and understood the Jewish idiom would have understood that Jesus came down on the side of generosity.  He said, it's not really, you know, predetermined, it's not set in stone.  how much is the first fruit.  It goes from 1 60th, actually, 1 60th of your income to 1 40th of your income.  And he says, err on the side of generosity.  So we just go in between, actually.  The figure is a little bit bigger than what I just said.  We go in between 1 60th and 1 40th.  We just say, one week's paycheck dedicated to God, is a great way to start the financial year.  Normally the financial year here starts in July, but we give people time to sort out their finances.  So in our tradition, in our church, we've done first fruits in August.  So all through the month of August, if you wish to give a special gift to God towards his work, I would give one week paycheck.  Just say, dedicated to the Lord, and just pray.  Say, Lord, now I honor you with this first fruit.  Thank you for accepting it, and I'm expecting, I'm expecting that you'll move in some wonderful, miraculous way to show that I've obeyed your word.  Would you show it to me that I've done the right thing by honoring you this way?  And you'll see.  Over and over, we have testimonies every year.  Without fail, every year, we got wonderful testimonies that come from people giving their first fruits.  Try it out.  It's going to take faith.  It's not easy, but it's going to work.  So God will honor his word every single time. ",
