            "text": "Sometime back, conservative commentator Ben Shapiro wrote a book called Facts Don't Care About Your Feelings.  This has apparently become a right-wing rallying cry.  I have people using that phrase frequently in the comments section of my videos.  I'm generally not fond of such phrases unless I've coined them myself.  Using someone else's catchphrase like that generally indicates to me that the person is not thinking for themselves.  Of course, the obvious and most immediate problem with this phrase, coming from a conservative like Ben, or Republican in general, is that the leader of the party is quite possibly the most fact-averse person currently walking the planet, perhaps ever.  The man wouldn't know a fact if it got coronavirus and died right in front of him 200,000 times.  He can't even keep his own story straight.  And the fact that Republicans have no problem with his constant lying means that by definition they have no regard for the truth.  on which facts are entirely dependent.  But the stranger part of this story to me is that Ben is religious, a religious Jew, although Ben's Judaism isn't particularly relevant.  Any person believing in the kind of magic inscribed in either the Hebrew or Christian Bible has no right using the phrase, facts don't care about your feelings.  Facts Really?  Where exactly are the facts in Western religion, the thing guiding Ben's entire life and the lives of billions?  Religion is an entirely fact-free zone, not the history of a certain area on the globe or who was king of Babylon at a particular time, though quite a few of those so-called facts in the not-so-good book have also been shown to be entirely made-up nonsense, including such founding stories as the Exodus.  That's not really my point here, though.  I'm talking about the underlying substrate of Western religion.  The idea that there is a magical supernatural fabric underlying everything we see, unseen of course, filled with magical supernatural beings who are directing and even thwarting our lives day in and day out.  That includes the afterlife, another fact-free realm.  Take a look at this.  20 questions with Pastor Mike, one of which is, will we remember each other in heaven?  Pastor Mike thinks he can answer that question, to which I would ask, based on what?  Even if you want to believe in the Bible, you will not find a verse answering that question.  There was no 20 questions with Jesus.  Where are the facts here, Pastor Mike?  We don't even know if there is a heaven, but Pastor Mike knows whether we'll remember each other there.  Hey, Pastor Mike, if I put a goldfish in the mailbox, will it go to heaven?  Then there's the other side of that coin, hell.  What do we know about hell?  What facts have been established about that not-so-supernatural realm?  Well, we know it's hot.  We know that there's fire, brimstone, suffering.  We wait.  We don't know any of that.  We know nothing.  For 2000 years, Christians have been scaring the shit out of people 100% fact free.  Then we have people like Christian apologist extraordinaire William Lane Craig, who has admitted he doesn't care about the facts.  For him, nothing trumps the witness of the Holy Spirit.  Like Ken Ham at his debate with Bill Nye, nothing could possibly change his mind.  My former religion, Mormonism, teaches its members the very same thing.  If you've had that burning in the bosom, nothing else matters.  Oh, and make sure you're using your gross income when calculating your 10% that you'll be sending in.  Then you've got my old buddy, Dennis Prager, the dean of my alma mater, Prager, you go devils, who in his video about the afterlife says this. ",
