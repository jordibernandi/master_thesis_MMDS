When theists make claims about the universe or biology, they may be easily refuted by people who've made astrophysics or biology their chosen disciplines.  But only after they did the hard work of studying their field.  You might as well claim that it's easy for someone to play guitar without taking lessons.  It's not.  I've tried.  Never got much further than learning to butcher Scotland the Brave.  And then my fingers started to really hurt.  I'll stick with animation as my art of choice.  The same with those who instead argue philosophy and logic.  Nobody is born able to identify and refute all of the logical fallacies, for example.  And boy, do theists make a lot of those.

But it's easy to give food to those who have none.  I've done it and it was as easy as buying three burgers instead of the two I wanted and giving the extra to the homeless dude outside the Mickey D's.  Hell, I stopped a suicide with a cartoon drawing of a medieval adventurer once and a really sloppy drawing too.  Long story.  But humanity seems to have an almost fetish for difficulty and sacrifice, like the journey matters more than the goal.  I'm not saying that the ends justify the means, but if you can make things easier on yourself without hurting anybody else, why take the hard way?  Being efficient is more virtuous than putting in the maximum effort when you can completely succeed without doing it.  And sacrifice your life?  Sometimes I wonder whether Christianity would have less of a kamikaze fetish if their savior hadn't felt the need to commit suicide by Roman for the alleged good of humanity.  You'd think an all-powerful god could just snap his fingers and magically end original sin rather than needing a sacrifice.  And no, that wouldn't remove free will any more than someone jumping in front of a bullet meant for you removes it.  Free will doesn't mean nobody interferes with your choices, it just means they're not mind controlling you.  But of course, for the record, I don't think free will is actually a thing.  I'm a determinist.  Oh, but maybe he means a metaphorical sacrifice, like making something your life's work, as if doing good for people can't be a hobby, something you do in your spare time.  This all sounds like all-or-nothing thinking, and life has more nuance than that. ",

This world doesn't belong to you, but you act like it does.  Bitter pill to swallow, Christians, but here it is.  You're not the heroes of this story.  You're the fascists.  And I don't use that term lightly or flippantly.  One of the many definitions of fascism is a form of political behavior marked by obsessive preoccupation with community decline, humiliation, or victimhood, and by compensatory cults of unity, energy, and purity.  Sounds remarkably like Christianity to me.  You're not under attack.  You're experiencing pushback against your behavior for what probably looks to you like the first time, so it feels like an attack.  For millennia, Christians have acted like bullies instead of sharing and playing nicely with the other kids.  Did you think you'd get away with it forever?  Stop trying to insert religion into secular state-run schools.  If you want your kids to have a 100% Christian upbringing, make your own schools.  I know they exist.  Stop trying to insert prayer into schools.  How would you like it if prayer in school was Islamic or Buddhist?  Now imagine how everybody else feels about you insisting the prayer.  be Christian.  Have a little empathy.  Stop trying to insert non-science into classes.  Creationism has no place in the science class of a non-denominational, government-run school.  Stop trying to control people's sex lives.  Homosexuality and birth control and premarital sex are none of your business.  For people who aren't members of your church, anyway.  And maybe not even for those who are.  Stop letting priests sexually abuse children and stop sweeping it under the rug when they do.  And stop doing all of the other unneighborly crap you people do.  Are you really so boggled that people might have had enough that you mistake defending themselves for attacking you?  Get actual.  And I keep hearing this offering nothing in return.  argument from Christians as seen here, like a wrong answer should be adhered to if an alternative is not presented.  But wrong is wrong, and if you're wrong, you should change what you're thinking.  That seems an oddly alien concept to these people, but it's true.  If atheists aren't offering you your life's meaning, but you're taking yours from a thoroughly debunked theology just because you're not getting exactly what you want or because it scares you, you're being horribly illogical.  It's like insisting Santa Claus is real because you're afraid you won't get any presents if you admit he's not.  And coming from someone who just claimed that difficult is better, to suddenly insist on the easy answers written in a holy book versus having to find your own meaning in life just seems hypocritical.
