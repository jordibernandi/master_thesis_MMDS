            "text": "In the textbook for victims of white supremacy, there are 10 stops that are listed.  One of those stops is stop cursing.  Stop name calling.  That's another one.  Stop name calling, stop cursing.  And generally speaking, according to the code, getting back to that term that I invented a few years ago, victims guaranteed qualification.  Victims of racism are all equal.  There's none of them that are bigger than others.  I mean, some black people have titles that are recognized by the white supremacists, but that doesn't mean anything.  Their major title is what?  The N-word in the system of white supremacists.  So it doesn't make any difference what your title is anyway.  That's your title.  And the other title that goes with that same thing, prisoner of war.  All prisoners of war are equal, regardless of what rank they had before they became prisoners of war.  So one prisoner can't really talk down to another prisoner.  We're just milling around in the prison yard.  Now, I might beat another prisoner into submission, or another prisoner will beat me into submission, but they're still whomever we all are.  as prisoners of war, have to answer to the prison master, even when we beat up on each other.  So the code says, stop it.  Just stop it.  Let people make up their own minds what they're going to do, because we're all equal prisoners just milling around in the prison yard.  We can give each other our opinions on how to go about not being prisoners, But we shouldn't try to put the muscle on each other.  Why?  Because it doesn't work.  Name-calling doesn't work.  I'm not going to call anybody a name except the name that the person wants to be called.  That's the way to go, according to the code.  That's part of what we call black culture.  We're proud of it, we say.  All right?  That's why I say it shouldn't be wished on anybody.  Name-calling.  The code says you never, ever, under any circumstance, Call anybody, white or non-white, male or female, young or old.  You never, ever call anybody by a name or a title that that person doesn't want to be called.  Never.  Under any circumstance.  Find out what the person's name is or what title the person wants to go by.  Even if a person, you know, comes up to you and says, I'm King Jesus.  I am Jesus, and that's what I want to be called.  Call the person by the name that he or she wants to be called.  From now on, call that person Jesus.  Why?  Because that's what the person requested.  You're not losing anything by doing that.  And all these other nicknames that you put on people and all like that, and the person says, don't call me that.  It's not constructive.  See, you can't stop somebody from calling you a name.  So what does the code say about somebody who calls you a name after you have told them what you would like to be called?  And they call you the N-word.  You just say, okay, that's your choice.  That's how you see me.  So you're just telling me that's how you see me.  So as a fellow prisoner of war, if it's one person of color, one black person talking about another, it doesn't mean anything in the prison yard.  So when somebody calls me any kind of name, like anybody can call me any name, but definitely white people can call me any name they want to call me, because they've done that anyway.  I mean, even the name Neely Fuller, I mean, if you go by, like in the Nation of Islam, and Elijah Muhammad said that, you know, he said they called him Elijah Pooh, and he said he ain't never been a Pooh.

He said, I'm Elijah Muhammad, you know, and I ain't never been a Pooh.  And so the other family member said, yeah, you were born Elijah Poo.  Said, that's the slave master's name.  That's what he calls me.  He can call me anything he wants to call me.  But I'll call myself what I want to be called, and that's good enough.  If a person tells me that, I would say, okay, I have permission to call you that.  But is there... Then I would immediately ask, that's the compensatory logic now.  Ma'am, is there... Any other word that you wouldn't mind me calling you?  What do people call you generally?  Because I would somewhat be thinking logically now, does everybody call you that all day, everywhere?  When you go apply for a job, you say that's who you are, that's your name, that's your title?  I mean, that, you know, I'm applying for a job and my name is Bitch.  Say, okay, Mrs.  Bitch, okay, you know, that's what you want to be called?  Yes, my name is Bitch.  Well, then I would immediately ask, well, ma'am, is there any other name, any pseudonym, which means a substitute name that you go by?  Say, well, I was born Helen Green, but I like the word Bitch.

Confusion and a problem.  I've got to explain to the entire crowd now why I called her that.  I've heard black ladies down through the years say that that's who they are.  In fact, I was sitting in a car once, and two ladies were riding in the car, with, I guess it was about six people in the car.  And two ladies got out of the back seat.  And they had been using a lot of profanity while they were in the car.  So they said, they turned around and talked to the other ladies who were still in the car.  And they said, now I know you young ladies think that we are a couple of bitches.  And we are.  And they walked away.  All right.  But that was their choice.  That's who they think, you know.  Some people say being, you know, a black female calling herself a bitch or being called a bitch, that is a super wonderful part of black culture.  Some people say that.  Some people who write songs say, hey, you know, if you can't call bitches black female bitches and whores, if you can't call them that, you ain't got no song.  I mean, how are you going to have a decent song and make any money?  And you ain't got that in there.  I mean, that's a part of us.  I mean, that's a part of our whole background.  I mean, our sisters, you know, our wives, our girlfriends, or that other guy's girlfriend or wife or sister, that's who she is.  She's a black bitch.  That's what she is.  I mean, you know, I mean, everybody should get on board with this.  I mean, this is wonderful.  I'm going to make millions off of this.  I mean, you know, a lot of people, like I said, apparently, I'm just going by what I'm looking at and what I'm listening to.  They say, oh, that's just a part of black culture.  It doesn't really mean what you think it means.  It's just a part of the culture.  And so the question is, is it constructive?  Does it have a constructive effect?  Because If we're going to have a black culture, that means anything now.  That word constructive has to be attached to it.  Otherwise, it's got no business being a part of anybody's culture. ",
