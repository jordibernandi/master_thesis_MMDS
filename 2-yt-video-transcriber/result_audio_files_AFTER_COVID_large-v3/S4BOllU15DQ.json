            "text": "Hey folks, Eric Stackelbeck here.  Welcome to the Watchman Newscast.  The U.N.  strikes again at a time when obviously the attention of Americans and much of the world is on the results of the U.S.  elections and all the controversy going on here right now.  The United Nations takes the opportunity on Wednesday, November 4th to pass seven U.S.  Count them, folks, seven anti-Israel resolutions.  Not only that, one resolution in particular denied any Jewish claim to the Temple Mount, which is the holiest site in all of Judaism, really in all of the world, where the first temple, Solomon's Temple, and the second temple, Herod's Temple, once stood.  By the way, if you're a Christian, Herod's Temple is the temple where Jesus taught, where he chased out the money changers.  Pretty serious resolution passed here by the UN.  You probably haven't heard about it yet because they kind of did it once again under the cover of all the election controversy here in the United States.  They kind of slipped those seven resolutions by.  We'll tell you more about it in a minute.  Before I get into it, I just want to encourage you to subscribe to the Watchman News channel right here on YouTube and click the notification bell so you get alerts every time a new video is posted.  Folks, we are bringing you the kind of cutting edge Timely information that you just won't hear anywhere else, certainly not in the mainstream media.  All of the media attention, obviously, and for good reason, is on the election right now and what the outcome is going to be here in the United States.  things continue to happen in the middle east.  i like to say that the middle east never sleeps and what happens in that region in the world's most strategic most volatile region will affect you no matter where you live and no place more than jerusalem the apple of god's eye the city where god almighty has written his name forever and the city that he has given to israel and the people of israel as their ancient and ancestral capital.  but That's not the way the United Nations sees it.  Oh, no.  As I mentioned just yesterday, Wednesday, November 4th, the UN, I'm going to check out my laptop here and I can quote to you directly.  The UN passed these seven anti-Israel resolutions.  which are basically slamming Israel over supposed human rights violations against the Palestinians.  and what's going on in Gaza, which is run by Hamas, a terrorist organization.  Yet the resolution condemns Israel over Gaza and not Hamas over Gaza.  Hamas, which has controlled Gaza for almost two decades now.  But I digress.  The resolution yesterday which was passed by the UN General Assembly's fourth committee in New York City.  This resolution was titled, bear with me folks, I'm reading it directly off the laptop here, Israeli practices affecting the human rights of the Palestinian people in the occupied Palestinian territory.  Remember, all of Israel is occupied in the UN's eyes.  in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem.  The interesting thing about it is Jerusalem is united, right?  In 1967, in the wake of the Six-Day War, Israel reclaimed Jerusalem, the IDF reclaimed Jerusalem, and Jerusalem was once again united, never to be divided again.  But that's what the forces at the UN want to do.  They want to divide Jerusalem.  God's city is Jerusalem, as I mentioned, but God is a God of unity and not division.  And I highly doubt that he wants to see the city where he has literally written his name be divided.  So they passed the resolution.  focusing on Occupy Jerusalem, in their words, the UN.  Here's the kicker.  Now, I said this was one of seven anti-Israel resolutions passed at the UN just yesterday, Wednesday, November 4th, almost under the cover of night, I'd like to say, because the complete attention of the world and understandably is on the United States right now and what's happening with the election outcome.  But the one resolution in particular, the one I just described, really caught my eye and caught the eye of the Jerusalem Post, who I'm quoting here, because in that resolution, It identified the Temple Mount, again, the holiest place, not only in Judaism, the holiest place in all the world, immensely holy for Christians for reasons I just described.  Jesus taught in the Temple on the Temple Mount.  God's divine presence dwelt there in Solomon's Temple on the Temple Mount.  Most coveted, most holy place of real estate in the world.  God has stamped his name there forever.  But the UN referred to it not as the Temple Mount.  They referred to it in this resolution just passed yesterday as Haram al-Sharif.  Literally, no mention of the Temple Mount.  Now, Haram al-Sharif is the Muslim name for the Temple Mount, meaning it's a Muslim possession.  Essentially, Muslims control the Temple Mount.  That's their view.  And the UN... apparently ascribes to that view, because in this resolution, the words Temple Mount were not mentioned.  Jerusalem, or the Temple Mount in particular, was identified as Haram al-Sharif, throughout the text of this resolution.  Folks, that's a big problem.  It denies history.  It denies the reality of the situation.  The Temple Mount is the Temple Mount.  It's the place, again, where the first and second temple once stood.  But the UN is denying history quite literally here.  And folks, it's pretty bold because it's not the first time they've done it.  Rewind.  to December 2016.  I believe it was December 22nd or 23rd.  Actually, it was December 23rd, 2016.  I'm pretty good with dates.  On that day, remember, the UN General Assembly passed that anti-Israel resolution denying the Jewish claim to the Temple Mount.  We've seen this script before.  It happened almost four years ago.  denied the Jewish claim to Jerusalem, the Temple Mount, the Western Wall, which is the retaining wall that helps hold up the Temple Mount, just for the layman out there, helps hold up the Temple Mount.  That's where you see people praying, obviously, all the time, 24-7, around the clock.  It's my favorite place in the world to pray, the Western Wall.  I've been privileged to pray there dozens and dozens of times.  It's had a profound impact on me.  But The UN in this resolution as far back as December 2016 said, no, Haram al-Sharif.  That's what the Temple Mount should be called.  This is the UN, folks.  This is the large global body.  This is the quote-unquote international community in full force.  Remember that resolution, what the big deal was here in the States about it?  Number one, just the gall of it, you know, to be passed.  It was during Hanukkah, and it was passed on Christmas Eve Eve, this resolution that was completely offensive to Christians and Jews, December 23rd, 2016.  That's number one.  But number two, The really interesting thing is that the Obama-Biden administration abstained from the vote on the UN Security Council.  Usually the U.S.  would always side with Israel, right?  And they would say, no, we're not going to let you pass this.  This must be vetoed.  We're not going to let this go through, this resolution.  The Obama administration abstained.  They said, we're not gonna step up this time and defend Israel's honor and integrity, the honor of Jerusalem, the honor of the Temple Mount at the UN, we're not gonna do it.  So the Obama-Biden administration took a pass and they didn't do it.  First of all, we don't need them to defend the honor and integrity of the Temple Mount.  God will do that because he holds the deed to that piece of land forever.  That's number one.  But number two, it was stunning because folks, this literally never happened before.  And it happened, it never happened before.  in terms of the United States, I'm sorry.  It's been a few long nights following election returns, I apologize.  But it's never happened before in that the United States has never abstained and not stood with Israel at the UN.  I frankly believe that that's one major reason the United States has been blessed more than any nation in the history of the world, because we have stood solidly for the most part, by and large, with Israel and been a safe haven for the Jewish people.  But we threw Israel under the bus, at least our government did, in December 2016, the Obama-Biden administration threw our closest ally in the world, Israel, under the bus in front of the eyes of the world as a parting shot out the door, by the way.  Remember, the Obama administration had less than a month left in office.  This was December 2016.  President Trump was inaugurated in January 2017.  And they do this as a kick to Israel out the door.  It was really just a despicable display in my view.  I don't use that word lightly.  It really was.  But guess what?  Israel's still in very good shape.  And the UN can continue to pass these anti-Israel resolutions, denying the Jewish claim to the Temple Mount of all places.  That's like denying the Jewish claim to Jerusalem is like denying China's claim to the Great Wall in Beijing.  or the United States claimed the Washington, D.C.  That's how pathetic and insane it is.  But this is what's happening at the world's largest and most influential global body, the United Nations.  Now, the Israeli ambassador, the new Israeli ambassador to the  U.N.,  Gilad Ardan, interesting guy.  He's also going to be the Israeli ambassador to the  U.S.,  So he's wearing two very important hats, Gilad Ardan.  We hope to interview him soon, by the way.  He's a great guy.  So he is Israel's new ambassador to the UN, and he's also Israel's new ambassador to the United States.  I'm not sure if the U.S.  Post started yet, but the UN Post has started.  As the sunlight's changing and getting in my face, okay, I apologize for that, folks.  But here's what Gilad Ardan said.  He called the passage of this UN resolution yesterday that we're discussing, really all seven of them, a disgrace.  And he said, no resolution passed here will change the eternal connection between the Jewish people and the holiest site of our faith, the Temple Mount.  And they purposely exclude, he says, the Jewish name for the site, the Temple Mount, did the UN.  Now here's where the kicker is.  in my view, nine countries, only nine out of what, 193 countries at the UN, I believe?  Only nine, including Israel, of course, voted against the resolution.  And God bless these countries, folks.  The United States, of course, under the Trump administration, Australia, Canada, Guatemala, Hungary, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, and Nauru, wherever that is, voted against the resolution.  And God bless Hungary.  That was a big deal for Hungary to do that.  I'm scrolling down here on my laptop from the Jerusalem Post here.  Now, some countries abstained, and that was Austria, Belarus, Cameroon, Slovakia, a few more.  You know, we'd love to see you do more than abstain.  We'd love you to be more, obviously more strong against this kind of shenanigans, these kinds of shenanigans at the UN.  But here's the main point here.  to keep in mind.  And if you live in these countries, we have viewers here at the Watchman Newscast from around the world.  If you live in these countries, let them know what you think.  One second as I scroll down here.  Folks, here we go.  European countries is in specific.  Here we go.  23 European Union states supported the resolution, including the United Kingdom, including Spain, including France supported this resolution.  23 European Union nations supported this resolution.  condemning Israel and referring to the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, the ancient and ancestral capital of Israel and the Jewish people, referring to the Temple Mount as Haram al-Sharif.  So if you are in a European Union country, let them know what you think about it.  You know, you can say, shoot an email to your local representative, EU representative, and say, hey, this is ridiculous, we don't stand for it.  So that's pretty sad to see the nations of the West who should know better supporting this anti-Israel resolution.  And folks, the strange thing about it is that the Sunni Arab nations who are all coming into the fold now with the Abraham Accords, we've discussed it many times here in the newscast.  I encourage you to check out our archives.  The Sunni Arab nations, they get it more than Europe does.  The Palestinian issue and all the rest, the Europeans are still obsessed with the establishment of the Palestinian state and these kinds of anti-Israel resolutions at the UN.  And the Sunni Arab nations, although they likely supported, I'm almost positive they supported these resolutions for their populaces, I'm sure, but they understand the stakes in the region, whether it's the Iran threat, they understand the greater need in the region is to confront the Iranian regime, not establish a Palestinian state at all costs.  So very interesting the dynamic there where Europe does not seem to get it, yet the Sunni Arab nations increasingly do, like Jordan, Egypt, the Saudis, UAE, Bahrain, Oman, and more.  So very interesting dynamic here.  Just wanted to share that with you, although all of our attention is focused obviously on the U.S.  election right now.  The UN still up to its old tricks concerning Israel and Jerusalem.  We will continue to keep an eye on it here at the Watchman Newscast, folks.  Hey, while you're at it, pray for the peace of Jerusalem.  Now more than ever, because the world, you know, the book of Zechariah talks about a day when Jerusalem will become a cup of trembling for all nations, that all nations will come against Jerusalem.  Do we see some harbingers of that here in these UN resolutions?  And thank God for nations like the United States that stand with Israel and Jerusalem at the UN.  Pray for the peace of Jerusalem.  And if you would, I'm an American.  I'm living in the United States.  Obviously, I love this country.  Pray for my country right now, the United States.  We could use all your prayers, prayers for peace here and a resolution that the truth comes to light, that everything done in darkness will be brought to light and the truth will come out.  So we pray for that resolution here in our election.  God bless you.  We will see you again Tuesday.  Who knows, maybe sooner with all the things happening in the world.  Until then, God bless you.  And remember, never hold your peace. ",
