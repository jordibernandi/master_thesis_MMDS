            "text": "Hello there, Carlton Pearson here with a word of edification and amplification for your soul.  Hear these words, they're rich.  A car ride is statistically more dangerous than a plane ride.  Yet most people overwhelmingly fear flying more than driving.  Why is that?  Because you're not the one in control.  You're not the driver on an airplane.  Same is to be said about life.  You get overwhelmed trying to control too much.  Trust me when I tell you that the energy that created you is a much better driver than your physical self will ever be.  Let go a little more.  Let the universe fill in the details.  Throw on some headphones, play your favorite songs, and enjoy the views more.  It'll be great.  That's a promise.  I love you.  I believe in you.  I believe in your essence as a human being, as a spirit, as a soul, as life on this planet.  The best is yet to come.  Namaste. ",
