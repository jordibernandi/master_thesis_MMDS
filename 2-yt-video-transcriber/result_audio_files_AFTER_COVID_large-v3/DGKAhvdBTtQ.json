Conservative... Conservatism is all there is.  in regards to radio talk shows.  Like, if you turn on the radio and you go to any fucking talk show, it's gonna be some conservative-leaning shit.  The most popular being, like, what's his name?  Fuck, what's his name?  I can't remember it.  It's... Oh, he's the old fuck.  He's that old fuck.  Except for maybe Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck.  NPR is kind of left-leaning, but even then they have, you know, they're pretty, like, center, right?  Um... On top of that, you can't argue that because you're conservative, you're getting doxxed, okay?  You realize Kiwi Farms is probably one of the most popular doxxing websites on the fucking internet, and they way disproportionately go after lefty-leaning people.  Now, they go after conservatives, too.  You know, they really don't like Ethan Ralph and, like, Richard Spencer anymore.  Like, as soon as a conservative figure or a Nazi that they like... Does something that they don't like they immediately call them a fed so they can disassociate and they immediately start boxing.  Okay, but lefty figures get doxxed overwhelmingly in comparison to conservatives.  Okay, do not even fucking attempt to do that.  not to mention the most popular lefty creator online is ContraPoints is being doxxed and harassed by other lefties.  You can't, you can't play the victim card on this, okay?  Like you can, like it takes like an ounce of research to just look it up and figure out that no, okay, conservatives don't get it worse than lefties do, okay?
