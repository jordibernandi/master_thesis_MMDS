            "text": "Hi everyone, SaneMain here.  This video was brought to you by a donation from Richard.  He didn't give me a specific topic.  So what I want to do is read a Reddit post from someone named CurseWithKnowing.  And he has quite a bit to say.  So before I read his words, let me first tell everyone about today's sponsor, The Brave Browser.  Zuck the Cuck drinks water like a duck, but he also drinks your data.

Here's what CursedWithKnowing has to say, and I quote, I was a manager for a company that had several divisions.  I was a manager for one of them, and a single mother was a low-level employee for another.  My ex-wife had left me the year before, and I was getting lonely, so I was susceptible to deception, and I fell for it.  Even though my wife had left me after years of mental abuse, my blue pill programming told me that she was just a bad woman, And all I needed to do was find myself in a Walt unicorn.  So the single mother makes it clear to me that she's available.  And we meet for breakfast one weekend morning.  Things go well and we meet again.  At the second meeting, we become intimate.  The sex is good.  She's relatively talented.  At the time, I wasn't equating talent to extensive experience.  After all, if she's good in bed, she had to learn it from somewhere.  We then quickly escalated to me meeting her children and me spending several evenings a week at her place.  I was treated to home-cooked meals, sex every night, and BJ's when she was on her period.  I mean every night, without fail.  Some things that I noticed came up, but I didn't fully recognize it at the time.  For one, she said she had her eyes on me for quite some time.  In other words, my wallet was being sized up for being a beta provider.  I thought she was attracted to me.  but in reality she was being attracted to my income as a manager, which eventually turned out to be not as much as she thought.  Another thing is that she was ex-military.  I had no idea at the time how slutty military women are.  I found out later that she was very sexually active in the military.  As a few months go by, she starts to mention how great a team we are and how we should work together.  She was hinting at cohabitation as she got the house from her ex-husband, but his child support money wasn't completely paying the mortgage and bills.  So being the blue pill simp that I was, I convinced myself that she had learned from her bad experiences how to appreciate a good man.  I told myself that I'd finally found my new Walt unicorn.  I thought that the nice guy had finally won.  So I began prepping to move in with her.  I told my landlord that I was leaving.  I ended up giving much of my furniture away.  As she already had nicer furniture, no doubt paid for by her ex-husband.  And then I moved in.  Almost instantly, things started to change.  The sex slowed and then stopped entirely.  Before it stopped, we did anal, and she admitted that she loved it.  But she didn't want to do it with me.  She said she didn't want me to think that she was a slut.  I was contributing to the household, but all the benefits got cut off.  Of course, she was love-bombing me in the trap in the beginning so she could spring it.  But once I was in in pink, she no longer had to provide a benefit.  Read Brie Folt's law.  As for anal sex, that was for Chad and Tyrone, but not for me.  I was the designated beta in her mind.  So even as I pay, I did not get what she gave to others for free.  The changes continued, her tone towards me became sharper.  She even stopped spending time with me.  One day after several months, she said she wasn't happy with this arrangement.  So she was asking me to move out.  Apparently, I was not making as much money as she wanted.  So it was time for me to go.  She went out with friends that night.  Of course, some of those friends were also coworkers.  So they told me that she hooked up with another guy that very night.  That was a strong lesson in what she taught me.  This entire event was devastating to me emotionally.  After all, I'd found my Newalt unicorn.  It was this event that red-pilled me.  It took everything I'd seen for decades and put it into a red-pill lens.  That's when I started finding red-pill content, but mainly PUA at that time.  I learned about female nature.  I learned that all women are like that, and that all things I saw growing up and as an adult were true female nature.  However, sleeping with a lot of women and spinning plates was not fulfilling.  When the Pound Me Too movement came along, the men were being falsely accused left and right.  But I decided to bow out of the dating scene entirely.  I'm now a MGTOW monk, and I'm saving for retirement.  I've been a nice guy.  I've been a beta simp.  I played the part of the Chad Pua for a while, too.  And now I'm a MGTOW monk, and I'm happy about it.  I'm an older guy in my 50s, so I was raised with the blue pill identity.  Every part of what I saw growing up was blue-pilled.  And as I grew with intact families all around me, the blue pill was simply seen as reality.  It took me a while to overcome the programming, but I have.  I know that reading this probably made some of you cringe.  Trust me when I say that I cringed while writing it.  I guess the point is that I learned, survived, and prospered after taking the red pill and going my own way.  For you younger guys, you can read this and learn from my experiences.  A smart man learns from his mistakes.  A wise man learns from the mistakes of others.  Thanks for reading this through.  Will Richard, thanks for the donation and hopefully you enjoyed hearing this particular story.  Cursed with knowing doesn't sound like he's cursed anymore.  He was lucky to have not married this woman and got stuck with alimony and child support payments for kids that weren't even his.  Obviously, when she told him that she had her eye on him for quite some time, the first thing that popped into my mind was the scene from The Matrix where Agent Smith says, We've had our eye on you for quite some time now, Mr.  Anderson.  She was using him for what he could do for her.  She realized he couldn't do much for her, so she kicked him to the curb, and as a result, he probably started reading PUA material, That red-pilled him because he didn't want to make the same mistake with women again.  Probably because he was getting too old to do it.  He was a nice guy that thought for the first time in his life.  he didn't finish last.  But was tricked into thinking that he'd keep getting to poke some single mother's ass.  He experienced the old bait-and-switch, or more like the bitch-and-switch, and now that the sex is gone, all he can do is masturbate.  At that point in his relationship, he might as well have put a rag on his wrist and painted a pair of lips on his thumb to meet the new woman in his life, Pamela, Pamela Harryhant.  Also, when a man experiences a woman love-bombing him at the beginning of a relationship, only to take that love away later, when a man fully understands that, it makes him question his own attractiveness to the opposite sex in general, and he becomes jaded as a result of that.  What I've learned after reading this experience is that women I was with were actually attracted to me, because they would beg me to give it up their poop chute, and I found it absolutely disgusting.  I guess that one man's treasure is another man's dark and messy torture.  The only thing I disagree with him on is the idea that a wise man learns from the mistakes of others.  In most cases, that's true.  But sometimes when you touch the stove and you get burned, you won't be touching that stove again, because your subconscious mind remembers the pain you felt, and it becomes hypervigilant.  It's like people that have gone through post-traumatic stress disorder.  I've experienced this sort of stress, and when I go anywhere near something that reminds me of my past trauma, I get IBS or some other symptoms.  to keep me away from that trigger.  If you've got PTSD, you might get a panic attack or you might get really, really angry at yourself.  I guess the curse with knowing is right after all, that we can learn from the mistakes of others.  I just did it right there when I learned that women that are attracted to you crave anal from you.  Another thing I recently learned is that I'd rather be an idiot in a room full of geniuses than a genius in a room full of morons.  At least there's the potential to grow as a person if the people around you challenge you to better yourself.  But perhaps you're embarrassed because you aren't smart enough to fit in.  So it forces you to think and grow.  But when you're surrounded by a moronic woman with boobs, you have to bring yourself down to talk about pointless things like the weather and what type of velvet drapes that she likes.  Being in a relationship not only means you lose time and money, but you lose being challenged intellectually and grow a lot slower than if you were actually single, or possibly not grow at all.  Another thing that shouldn't surprise any man is how quickly women move on after a man, even when they say they love you.  His experience where the woman he was with dumped him and then hooked up with another guy the same night is similar to an experience I had with a girlfriend that I was with for five years.  The weekend after I was technically over with her, she was hooking up with another guy at a local bar.  The guy she met that night she ended up having kids with.  that ended up looking like Nosferatu.  Years later, she told me that the guy she ended up with was the guy she met that night.  obviously trying to rub the salt in the wound, that she healed for me a long time at that point.  She was spiteful because I bought her a gift that she rejected and I took back to the store.  And while I was at the store, I met the girlfriend I was with for 10 years.  Talk about coincidence.  So I guess she felt hurt and bad that her own selfish action had led to me losing her.  The moral of the story is you never reject someone's gift.  Who does that?  I guess that in my case, it was a great thing at that time.  When Cursed With Knowing tells younger guys that they can learn from the experiences of older men without going through their own experiences, he's saying that after he's gotten his own life experiences.  There is no substitute for life experience when you fall in love with the wrong woman.  There are no unicorns.  That's just us being young and idealistic until life finally beats it out of us.  All there is is anger and disappointment.  Even in the so-called happy relationships out there, I oftentimes witness the women subtly torturing the man emotionally and mentally by making him jealous or gaslighting him or monopolizing all of his time.  Life moves fast and for me it's probably halfway over.  And there's barely enough time to do what I want to do and the thought of having to spend my time bored out of my gorge entertaining and supporting some single mother for the chance to spawn up her poop chute Just makes me quiver.  That sounds like a great way to live out the rest of my mortal existence.  Making her life better while she makes my life hell.  Cursed with knowing.  if you actually ever hear this, then understand that you're lucky because you probably would have stayed with that woman if she hadn't kicked you to the curb.  Because you loved her, and you would have stayed for the potential of having sex with her again someday.  At least she was nice enough to break your heart instead of leading you on and basically getting child support for her children.  That's why you don't tell people about your success if you can to avoid gold-digging single mothers.  Of course, in this case, if women see that you're a man as a manager, then they know or they think they know how much money you make and are planning on spending your money before they even start dating you.  Also, with regards to dating military women, it's something I've never done, but some guys have told me that there are two types of women in the military.  The ones that are lesbians are the ones that go into the military to sleep around.  Obviously, we know which woman this man was cursed with.  I've also heard some guys say that there's a third type of woman that goes into the military, and she's there because she's looking for a husband.  Again, I don't know, so maybe some of you that are in the service can let me know down in the comments section below.  Anyways, that's it for today.
