            "text": "Hey guys Alex aka Miggy here and I thought I would create this video to warn others of what kind of effery this is a PG-13 channel so I'm not gonna swear is going on when you're trying to book your airplane tickets.  For those of you who like to save a little bit of money and use skyscanner.com, you're flinching where you want to fly and it'll give you many different options.  It'll show you many different airlines that are going to be flying there.  So you can select your cheapest flight or the quickest flight, whatever you want to do.  the problem happens is for example when you want to book your flight they cost too much money and you decide to go with some cheaper airline like Malindo Air for example.  they're popular around Southeast Asia.  you click on their link and basically what often happens is let's just do this here now.  so I want to fly to from Sydney Australia, to Bali, Indonesia.  We're going to depart on, what should I say, 18th of February, it's a one-way trip, and let's do this, so you click on search flights, and what happens is you get a whole list of the cheapest the fastest and the best flights.  so here are all the details and okay say for instance I want to fly with Qantas.  Qantas is probably the best airline in the world.  or actually you know what.  I'm gonna show you what happened with me exactly.  so I wanted to fly to Vietnam and there was a flight that was probably the cheapest.  it was run by Malindo Air.  so I clicked on it and go select 283 Australian dollars.  now this is where it gets tricky.  I get like this whole list here of different companies that they act like a third party.  so what they do is instead of going direct to Malindo Air website you get an option here to to save a little bit of money.  because see if you book it through travel to be which is a reseller of the tickets it'll cost you 193 or showing dollars.  but if you book it through say cheapo air it'll cost you 314 dollars.  now for me the cheapest one was kiwi air.  where is it?  there's little.  Okay, here we go.  Kiwi.  So you can see their rating, not that great.  I mean, there are far worse ones like Bravo, Fly, or Apodo.  But anyway, Kiwi, I got 3 out of 5 stars, so not the best rating.  I ended up booking the flight for them.  And what happens is they take you... You get away from... You get redirected from skyscanner.com onto the kiwi.com website.  And kiwi.com, they're not an airline.  They're just the reseller of tickets.  And when I bought my ticket, I just literally... I booked it.  And at the time, I thought not to... I did not want to purchase... baggage.  so I just thought I would do a carry-on which was stupid because you can only take seven kilograms with your carry-on.  so I decided about a week later well before my flight to purchase some additional baggage of something like 25 kilograms which is for check-in.  and I still had about seven kilos to take with me on board.  and this is what happened next.  this is the kicker.  so I paid one hundred and I think one Australian dollars to purchase the baggage the check-in baggage.  it took the money out of my credit card and i thought i was done with it.  about a week later when i got to the airport and i was checking in and the melinda air stuff when you're checking in they told me oh looks like you don't have any baggage purchased so it's going to cost you 15 dollars per kilogram.  and i had 25 kilograms.  So they ended up charging me $320 because they said that I did not purchase additional baggage for the check-in.  I was absolutely shocked because like I said before I paid $101 for the baggage and It was taken out of my credit card.  I showed it to the clerk at the front desk of the airline.  He said, well, thekiwi.com did not pay them.  So it's my fault that apparently their computers malfunctioned and my money did not go through.  It's like basically buying a train ticket for $10.  Then you board the train and then five minutes later you get ticket inspectors.  And they go, can we see your ticket, sir?  And you say, ah, yes, here it is.  And you show them the ticket, but then they look at their system on their little portable computer and they say, oh, I'm sorry, sir, the money, the $10 that you supposedly paid for this ticket, which you have in your hands, has not been processed on our end.  So we are going to give you a $320 fine.  So that's exactly what happened to me.  So I had to pay the $320.  Then I got in touch with Kiwi.com who said that I would look into a trade away and they did get back to me within 24 hours.  And guess what their answer was?  They said, oh, we will refund you.  But guess what?  They refunded me the $101 and I was still stuck with a fine of $320 for the baggage.  That's not good enough.  So I contacted my credit card company and I immediately launched a dispute to get the $320 back because it's not my fault that their system malfunctioned.  I don't care.  They saw that I got the money back for the $101, but I still said, look, that's not my problem that their computers weren't working properly.  I should have been charged $101, not $320.  Anyway, the point of this video, the point of the story is, when you're booking airplane tickets, say, for example, you want to fly with the best airline in the world, Qantas.  Damn, I'm not even getting paid for this.  But Qantas is truly one of the best airlines out there.  It was voted, I think, the best airline in the world this year or last year.  I can't remember.  So, if you're going on a website like skyscanner.com, always make sure to go to the actual website that sells Qantas tickets.  So, if you're clicking on the Qantas... go to where.  is it so?  normally the flight is about 366. that's the cheapest one.  but if you go to Qantas it's $30 more.  okay it's 30 more and you see it says airline.  but definitely guys the 30 bucks that you will have to spend extra is so much worth it because it'll take you to the official Qantas website and you know it's.  there's not going to be any f-upery.  you know what i mean without profanity so it's just so much better.  you know that if you purchase additional baggage or if you purchase your seats or if you purchase food whatever you don't have to purchase food on costless flies because it comes for it's already included.  anyway you will know that you're getting the best service for your buck.  don't go to kiwi.com.  Don't go to some cheapoair.com.  Don't go to all these shitty resellers.  I can guarantee you that if you book about 5 to 10 flights over the next 6 to 12 months, you will have some definite F-ups.  100%.  Always go to the actual site of the airplane flight.  Even if you have to pay $20 or $30 extra, it's well worth it.  Anyway, I'm still waiting for to get my refund with the dispute and hopefully I get it back because 320 Australian dollars is a lot of money considering when you're being overcharged for some baggage which should have been 100 bucks.  Anyway guys, thanks for watching.  Hopefully this will help you in your travels around the world.  Make sure to get those credit cards that earn you Qantas reward points or Virgin reward points or Emirates reward points because the more you fly, the more you purchase online or in store, you get this Qantas points or other points and then you can redeem them to upgrade to business class or to save a lot of money on your airplane tickets.  So, this is just an extra little hack for you guys.  I'm sure most of you know it, but if you don't, It's well worth it.
