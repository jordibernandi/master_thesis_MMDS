            "text": "Several people have asked me about all of the religiosity on display at the 2021 inauguration of President Joe Biden.  In case you missed it, Biden was sworn in on a Bible big enough to block a four-lane highway.  It was huge, five inches thick.  This Bible has been in the Biden family for well over 100 years, and he has used it for every swearing-in that he's been involved with since 1973.  Before the actual swearing-in, we got the invocation by a Jesuit priest.  He's a longtime friend of the Bidens, Reverend Father Leo J. O'Donovan.  And he told the gracious and merciful God that the United States bowed before him seeking divine blessings. ",

            "text": "We had a benediction by another reverend, Pastor Sylvester Beeman.  He's another longtime Biden associate.  We had country music legend Garth Brooks.  And I love Garth Brooks, but he was there belting out his rendition of Amazing Grace.  Now, religiosity is nothing new in American politics.  The Bible has been an effective prop for a long time.  And I think Biden genuinely does hold to a personal religious belief.  In his inauguration speech, he used a ton of religious language.  We are a nation under God.  The Bible says that joy cometh in the morning.  Work and prayers have brought us to this day.  And of course, he closes with the usual line.  May God bless America and may God protect our troops.  But now here is where things get really interesting.  And we see an interesting problem beyond the stuff that we already know about a state church separated republic.  If you listen again to Biden's speech, it's mostly about humanism.  Respect people, including people outside your in-group.  Tell the truth.  Help the disadvantaged.  Protect the planet.  Reject racism and sexism and bigotry and hatred.  Seek justice in this world.  That kind of thing.  Humanism.  There's an irony here.  I think that's even bigger than the Biden Bible.  Biden was sworn in on a book.  that's the antithesis of the speech that he gave a few minutes after.  I mean, you can cherry pick the love verses out of the Bible.  The Bible is also a book of misogyny and shame and outgroups and torture and oppression and murder, genocide, hellfire.  Biden's refreshing focus on restoring science to things like COVID and climate change, it has to reconcile itself somehow with this ancient collection of myths and magic.  These are strange contradictions, I think.  How do you advocate for LGBT people while swearing in on the Kill the Gays book?  How can you advocate for gender equality when you swear in on the Women Submit and Be Silent book?  How do you promote science when you swear in on the Talking Animals and Blood Magic book?  Finally, there's the message under the message.  When you are speaking to a representative republic that's made up of citizens, of all faiths, or no religion whatsoever, what do all these Christian prayers and hymns and that big-ass Bible communicate to American non-Christians?  These elements have an othering effect.  They favor a single, privileged religion and its members, reinforcing that bogus Christian nation narrative, violating the Establishment Clause of the Constitution.  You can talk all you want about diversity and inclusion.  Don't tell me that Christian nationalists aren't picking up on this, or that those who aren't Christians aren't feeling a bit excluded from the party.  And I don't buy that Biden gets a pass simply because it's his religion of choice, his personal faith, because the rules don't apply equally.  And if you want proof of that, let's see a future president who is not a Christian.  try to swear in on another holy book like the Koran.  Watch the religious freedom crowd totally lose their minds.  We're a nation with Christians.  We are not a Christian nation.  We're a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews, Hindus, Sikhs, Jainists, Buddhists, Wiccans, Deists, Atheists, etc.  Roughly a quarter of American citizens are religious nuns, non-religious.  How are we supposed to feel about an inauguration that comes off like a Christian church service?  And while I am genuinely delighted, and I am delighted, to see an immediate return toward LGBT protections and the acknowledgments of other religions and faith traditions, and we've seen that beyond the inauguration, an acknowledgment of the vast color and culture spectrum that is this country, there's still something missing.  The 26% of non-religious Americans who are just as American as everybody else.  Religion is a protected free expression in this country, but the Oval Office isn't a church.  Let's skip the magic book and the sermons.  Let's take the oath on the Constitution.  Leave the God speak for private life.  Let's widen the tent so we're not ignoring the millions of non-Christian Americans who love their country, who have an equal voice and an equal vote, who are growing in numbers and influence every single day.  These people are not citizens of the United States of Christianity.  They are citizens of the United States. ",
