            "text": "Good.  How it happened was, like many discoveries, somewhat accidental.  You discover something in a context which turns out not to be the natural context for studying it.  The string theory originated as a theory of protons and neutrons and mesons.  These are objects about 100,000 times smaller than an atom.  Very big by physicist standards.  Enormous, in fact.  Great big fat marshmallows.  Protons, neutrons, mesons, they are string-like.  You can stretch them out.  They're almost like Turkish taffy.  You pull on them and they stretch out.  It was an effort to describe them that the mathematics and the constructions that went into string theory were first invented by myself, by Nambu, by other people.  And we described this mathematics that was supposed to be describing protons and neutrons.  And it did a pretty good job of that, incidentally.  It did a pretty good job of that.  But nature repeats itself, apparently, and on scales a billion, billion times smaller, that same mathematics seems capable of describing physics at the Planck scale.  It seems capable, perhaps, of describing the physics of quantum gravity a billion, billion times smaller than it was originally set out to describe.  So in a sense, it was an accidental discovery intended to be describing something quite different than quantum gravity.  It was, incidentally, other people who observed that if you took the same mathematics and shrunk it and sped it up, incidentally, by a billion, billion times, it was capable of describing gravity. ",

And if the rubber band didn't have friction, you could imagine it vibrating and vibrating and vibrating forever.  That's the character of these strings.  But remember, they are quantitatively very different than rubber bands.  They're billion, billion, billion times smaller than rubber bands.  And it's interesting to ask how strong they are.  I once calculated that they are about strong enough that at the surface of the Earth, if you could connect one end to 10 to the 40th Mack trucks, you could lift up the 10 to the 40th Mack trucks with them.  And that's one?  One string.  That's why they're so small, because they're so difficult to pull apart.  So they are very thin, very small, and very, very strong. ",

What string theory is at the present time is it's a mathematical structure which looks more like the universe or more like the universe of elementary particles than any other theory which contains gravity.  All other theories, in fact, quantum field theory, not only don't contain gravity, they can't contain gravity.  Gravity is inconsistent with them.  String theory has the property that automatically contains gravity.  It can't avoid gravity.  It also contains particles.  It contains particles that look roughly like quarks, particles that look like photons, particles that look like gravitons.  But it has never been put together in a form which is so close to natural reality that we're certain that it's correct.  It has never been put together in that form.  It's a mathematical structure.  And for me, one of the things about that mathematical structure is it's so mathematically precise that we can try out ideas in it.  Ideas like, for example, how black holes work.  Ideas, for example, like the holographic principle, we can try them out in a very, very precise mathematical context and see whether they make mathematical sense.  That probably has been the most important aspect of string theory up till now, trying out and testing the consistency of ideas about how quantum mechanics fits together with gravity.  At the present time, it is quite far from describing nature with any great precision. ",
