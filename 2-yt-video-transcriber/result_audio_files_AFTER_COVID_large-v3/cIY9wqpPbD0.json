I've been bringing you stories in that regard.  so here is an update from you know some compilations I've made across Nigeria.  First of all, we have an innovation responding today.  costs the high cost of testing and treatment for COVID-19.  So the Minister for Health once revealed that it costs about 10,000 naira to test just one individual for COVID-19, not to talk of the cost for treatment.  So this individual sought out a low cost and minimal risk innovative way of promoting testing in Nigeria and this innovation has been deployed in Ogun State as we speak.  Take a look. ",

            "text": "So the person to be tested comes up, the gloves are on and then the test is administered and then he puts the sample inside this box.  So the advantage of this is that the healthcare practitioner does not come in contact with the person, number one.  Number two, if you are testing outside without this box, then you have to wear a full PPE with boots.  That cost can be up to 50K.  And you also have to change it with every patient.  So if you are testing 50 patients per day, then you are spending 50 times 50.  If you have 10 people here, then you are spending 50 times 10 times 50.  So you can imagine the expense on PPE alone.  without this box.  So this box saves money because you will be able to use less PPE.  Nobody's coming directly in contact with the patient.  And it saves the lives of the healthcare worker because the healthcare worker is also running less risk because they're not coming in contact with the patient.  It's not as if I'm coming up to you to take a sample, no.  They are separate from the patients.  So those are the two advantages.  And every time a sample is taken, a hygienist will come and spray down these gloves to clean the gloves for the next patient. ",

And then, of course, there'll be minimal risk.  of infection faced by the healthcare worker.  I mean, what do you think guys?  What do you think about this innovation?  So the next innovation I want to share with you is aimed to promote low cost and safe hand washing practices in the public.  This innovation was actually made by students of Kwaraste Polytechnic in the Department of, I think, Mechanical Engineering.  So this is meant to be deployed in public spaces where, you know, we congregate a lot.  We all know how, as Africans, we are more communal in nature, so we tend to congregate a lot in, you know, in the public space.  So this innovation is aimed at promoting safe and low-cost hand-washing practices in the public.  Take a look. ",

But the government has been on top of the game, just going ahead to put in place systems and structures just to ensure that people are tested and people are treated as much as possible.  So new testing centers have been set up in Lagos State closer to the people in order to promote more testing and then early detection of infection for treatment.  So thank you so much, Lagos State government and all of the frontline workers responding in the face of this pandemic.  On a final note, regardless of the daunting task that our frontline health workers are faced with responding to the pandemic, these two health workers are finding a way to remain in high spirits and on top of the game.  so that's it for today's video.  what do you think about these innovations and you know all of the response efforts being carried out so far in nigeria?  drop a comment guys.  um if you have any stories about innovations and you know best practices that are being implemented in different countries in africa please share with me drop comments or send me an email with video clips and and pictures so that i can amplify the story here.  as you all know we are all about sharing all the positive stories from africa.  okay thank you so much guys for watching and if you've not subscribed to my channel what are you waiting for?  go ahead and subscribe.  thank you so much guys.  i'll see you in my next video but until then stay safe stay healthy and below abiding bye.
