            "text": "I'm gonna say it.  I'm gonna say the word.  So you remember a few months ago when Boomer was a slur?  Boomer is the N-word of ageism.  Being hip and flip does not make bigotry okay.  While I regret to inform you, the internet is back at it again.  The new slur to hit the outrage market is the name Karen.  Karen is a slur.  Just take a wild guess at what group of people is behind this.  That's right.  the TERFs, the Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminist, because I guess TERF is a slur didn't catch on.  So there's like a pandemic going on, like nobody's going out in public, so the TERFs can't like go into women's restrooms and pull the pants down trans kids.  So they're a little bored.  So Julie Bendell, yes that Julie Bendell, tweeted this last night.  Does anyone else think the Karen slur is woman-hating and based on class prejudice?  So if you guys don't know what the Karen slur is, Karen is a meme.  It's used to describe like the, can I speak to the manager attitude?  Complainy whiny first world.  That's what being a Karen is.  Now I've called men Karens, like that one theme park reviewer that like, complained about a Starbucks being closed during a category five hurricane.  That was a male Karen.  Karen is like a type of person.  It's an attitude.  I love this, by the way.  I've got a mate named Karen and I love her, just saying.  Listen, I have Karen friends, okay?  Yes, it's sexist, classist, and ageist, in that order.  So like, I'm gonna give them, I'm gonna give them a little bit of leeway.  I could see how they see it's kind of sexist because it is a, it is a female name.  So sure, let's give them that, I guess, if you're gonna like look through the lens of like a feminist.  I could see how Karen, Is that sure?  Like, I'm really trying.  You can tell that I'm trying very hard to play devil's avocado here.  It's not working.  Just shut the f*** up.  It's not sexist.  The classist one is the part that gets me, though, because the Karen insult is usually aimed at, like, upper class or middle class people who are looking down at working class or poor people.  That's the whole, can I speak to the manager?  Because they're, like, mad at, like, Employees, they're mad at like the minimum wage workers.  I'm just gonna tell you right now, I am a middle-class white woman.  I give you all the K word.  pass, you can all say Karen.  Yes, I think race might play a role as well.  I've never seen a woman of color referred to as a Karen.  Look at them like just reaching so hard for these oppression points.  These women just like clearly wanna have their own N-word.  New meme format, same old misogyny.  Women who speak up for themselves, seek to clarify they are being taken advantage of or dare challenge someone with authority, parentheses, the manager, don't know their place.  Ridicule until silenced or return to private sphere.  Reformat, repeat.  I love it, it's just like parentheses.  the manager.  Definitely, they're running out of insults for women and making them up.  Idiots, love to all the Karens.  There's like a Karen uprising happening.  Karen solidarity.  When I was in my 20s, the slur against younger working class women was Sharon and Tracy.  I honestly cannot think of any equivalent for men, but I am so sick of women.  The American people are tired of women.  Including those of us that have devoted our lives to women's liberation being spoken about so disrespectfully.  I love how Julie Bendel is going off about disrespect.  This is like one of the most infamous man-hating feminists out there.  Look, this is literally an article from her.  This summer, why not indulge in some good old fashioned man-hating?  And it's about the fucking Scum Manifesto.  Have you guys ever read the Scum Manifesto?  I've always wanted to do like a reading of it on my channel.  It's like Mein Kampf for like radical feminists.  It's nuts.  Why not some good old fashioned man-hating?  She's like, Karen is disrespectful.  Shut up, dude.  Any 30 plus woman who speaks up for herself, who is having a bad day, who has a haircut you don't like, Karen.  memes have gotten old.  I love how they're just excusing the pushy, entitled attitude of these women people make fun of by being like, Any woman who has a bad day.  I had a Karen throw a frozen ice cream cake at me when I worked at an ice cream store because she came in like a minute before we closed and the soft serve machine was down.  Do you guys have any Karen stories?  I would love to hear it.  Put your Karen stories in the comments.  I am really sick of your Sharon shaming.  Sake.  It's the Sharons and Karens who are helping keep you fed and looking after your gran.  Go on, show me how funny you are by making a mocking meme about Ben.  Ahmed.  or Akini, go on, I dare you.  They are really mad about this.  It's the Karens and the Sharrens that are keeping society afloat.  So I found this on Our Gender Critical, which is the same subreddit that I talked about in my.  I don't want a baby boy video where the TERFs talk about how they would abort their child if it was a boy.  So they were complaining about the Karen slur a year ago.  I hate Karen.  It's such an example of rampant casual misogyny that even the woke crowd has no issues using the Karen-can-I-speak-to-the-manager-middle-aged-white-soccer-mom trope because she is represented as a middle-aged, unsexy, cis white woman.  Talk about mommy issues.  Having worked fast food, I can tell you that 95% of our problematic customers were men.  If a woman ever rolled her eyes at me or said something stupid, it was nothing compared to the aggressive, creepy, transgressive, and destructive behavior constantly displayed by males.  I hate when people call men and women males and females.  Femoids and moids.  It pisses me off too.  It's always okay for a woman to be the butt of a joke.  What reality do you live in where that is true?  If you make fun of a woman, there'll be like 20 simps coming for your throat and other women like, how dare you that you're being misogynistic?  Like it is not socially acceptable to be mean or make women the butt of a joke.  Could you imagine commercials making like the wives stupid and clumsy?  How do I pour this carton of milk?  I think what happens when women in midlife act up is they, we, are sick of taking shit from all corners and have gotten rid of the fucks there were to give.  What is it that's comical or pathetic to people about Karen?  Is it the perception that she's over the top about comparatively trivial stuff?  If I'm paying $30 for pasta I could make at home, it had not better be waterlogged.  i want dressing on the side because i don't want a totally sauced salad and nope i don't trust people to get it right without my emphasis because i have met a critical mass of humans and i know what they're like.  i'm nice about it.  absolutely.  i'm eating an entire plate of waterlogged pasta.  no i am not.  I love how these people are just trying to defend themselves from the Karen insult, but are being complete Karens.  Your purpose for existing in their man's world is to be abused by men.  That is what you are here for, to be their punched bags, just there.  so men have something they can all unite against in the name of their manhood and throw rocks at, to elevate the significance of their male selves in their male empires.  Oh my God.  I'm actually concerned.  Is this person okay?  Karen is a racist and a sexist slur.  This is 152 days ago.  So this isn't new.  The TERFs have been complaining about Karen being a slur for quite some time now.  In a world.  in a world where combating racism is considered to be woke-ass and combating sexism is too.  Why the hell does YouTube promote racist and sexist anti-MLM channels?  These people do everything in their power to promote being assholes to hard-working business women like myself.  We got a CEO.  We got a female CEO on our hands, everybody.  And see anyone that doesn't support their anti-women agenda as brainwash sheep, wake up sheeple.  to the Karen question.  Seriously, look how many people they refer to as Karen, a racist slur against whites, a sexist slur against women, and an ageist slur against mothers.  How the are they getting away with this?  If a white girl sings a Drake song, she gets booed off stage and taken away by security.  But if a bunch of people start referring to business women, frugal mothers, and older women, who have standards by a slur meant to slander them at any turn.  Yes, sweetie, you are entirely in the wrong.  Karen is a slur against women who have standards.  To all the Karens out there caught in the crossfire, I got your back.  Solidarity forever, oh my.  I was joking about the Karen solidarity thing, but here it is unironically.  I just, I can't even make jokes anymore.  The worst part is that now if I think of a funny white mom joke, I have to keep it to myself or the men will think I'm one of them.  Incredible, just incredible.  I don't even know what to say.  Also, if I'm not mistaken, wasn't Karen originally one of those manosphere terms of contempt for women like Carol and Stacey?  The next thing you know, there's gonna be like a Washington Post opinion piece about how Karen is an alt-right dog whistle.  Okay, Karen, the casual misogyny of Karen memes.  Karen has her own family to prioritize.  She does not have time to coddle other men.  Karen is a victim of redundancy from male gaze.  Karen's assertiveness is self-serving, unapologetic, and if it is rooted in entitlement, you can bet as a woman it's an entitlement that doesn't extend to all areas of Karen's life.  As a feminist, I find myself sympathizing with Karen.  Even as a 30-something woman firmly planted in the millennial age group, I'm not ashamed to say I recognize myself as a Karen.  Fourth wave feminism is calling the cops on a cookout.  Karen is the scourge of the incompetent worker willing to call out bad service and get what is rightfully hers.  This has to be satire.  So I checked and I regret to inform you it is not satire.  Why is it acceptable to vilify Karen's particular brand of female consumerism?  With this realization of casual misogyny and ageism comes threat from the future and no amount of pronouns will save you.  There's the TERF again.  They're all TERFs!  Here's the comments on the article.  I agree with you about Karen.  Men strike out against Karen for the obvious reasons.  Nothing turns them on more than getting out torches and pitchforks against women who aren't going to start crying or supplying fellatio when the usual male tactics are used.  Oh my god, she like deadass wrote a novel.  This woman wrote a whole ass book!  I just scroll down to the end.  White women who turn down black dick.  and lady can't be because they deserve it.  And ugly women can't be because they've been done a favor.  And yes, it is that bad.  Holy shit, go to therapy.  These people just have such a talent to turn any little thing into like an absolute travesty.  And in all my years of just making fun of this dumb shit, It never gets old.  So that's about all the time I have for this.  I hope you guys enjoyed this video.  Do you like the unscripted rant style?  I had a lot of fun with it.  Special thank you to all my patrons, and I will see you all with a new video very soon. ",
