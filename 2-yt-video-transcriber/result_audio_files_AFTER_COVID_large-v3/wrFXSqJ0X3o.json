This is a sponsorship that I am so proud and excited to announce.  I myself used to just settle for being messy.  You know, you have your period, you're using Tampons, pads, sometimes you spill over and you're just like, this is what it is, this is the plight of being a woman.  And it wasn't until the last couple years that I decided to totally up my period game.  What I do is I use a Diva Cup, which at first was a very strange sensation, but you totally get used to it, I promise.  And then, because sometimes your cup runneth over, I would pair that with these thanks period underwear.  When you're using these products, you are saving the environment.  You're saving money by not wasting it on pads and tampons.  Also in the midst of Corona, you don't want to be running to the store to get your feminine products.  So thanks can save you those trips.  So please check out the link below for my promotion code and enjoy your own pair of thanks underwear.  Now let's talk about the concerning ministry of Dale Partridge.  Last week I addressed the Paul Morgan, Jacqueline Glenn videos and in that my goal wasn't to make anyone think Morgan is in a bad or unsafe relationship.  My goal was to simply share my own past with toxic relationships and my view on how the church and its doctrinal systems can really be used to manipulate and subjugate other people.  Toxic doctrine can truly empower men to coerce and manipulate women.  Which brings us to Dale, who frankly makes Paul look like a left-wing feminist in a text me. ",

            "text": "According to an article in Christianity Today, Partridge said that in his early 20s, he embraced something called the, quote, uncopyright movement, which put forth the idea that, quote, all ideas are God's ideas.  Dale, plagiarizing MLK because it was God's idea is the most colonizing BS I've ever heard in my life.  I'll link my video below on colonization for your reference.  I won't waste too much time on this, but I am happy to link articles below proving that although Dale claims to have turned a new leaf, He continues getting caught plagiarizing others for the gain of his own Instagram.  Shady, shady, shady already.  It gets worse.  Dale is now beginning a quote school of biblical church planting, which costs $399 per month for 12 months.  So 4,788 bucks.  And he's doing this apparently, and please anyone, including Dale yourself, correct me if I'm wrong with zero credentials.  From what I could dig up, Dale is currently enrolled part-time at Western, but he has not yet received a degree.  Also, according to Christianity Today, Dale and his wife Veronica promoted his book, Real Christianity, with a fabricated quote from a non-existent person.  When he got caught, his excuse was that it was a quote, mock quote, used during the design of the store on the relearn church website.  I think it's wrong, misleading and manipulative to ascribe quotes to yourself that you never said and to ascribe titles to yourself that you've never earned.  I've noticed that Dale talks about seminary school and never mentions that he did not graduate in any other profession besides an online Instagram ministry.  That BS would not only be frowned upon, but outright illegal.  If you were a therapist or a doctor claiming to be qualified, you could lose your right to practice irrevocably.  And even hairdressers have to go to an excruciating process and attest to qualify for what it is they do.  But here we are acting like we're supposed to respect Dale as a bona fide pastor.  I think not.  So let's take a pause.  I know it's somewhat out of character for me to be throwing this much shade, but I'd ask you if I were saying this about a totally secular person in a secular profession, And I was calling out lies and misinterpretations of facts.  Would you say I was being inappropriate or not a nice Christian?  I think it's a problem that once someone puts on a priest collar or puts minister on their Instagram handle that we're just supposed to be syrupy, sweet and kind and just accept what they're saying.  And no, I'm not doing that with Dale because I see a lot wrong here.  The most concerning thing about Dale and his ministry is that he does not seem to value or respect women as his actual equal. ",

Countercultural should be standing up for the sick and dying while the leaders of our country continue to make basic healthcare inaccessible to the poor.  But no, when biblical literalists talk about counterculture, They're really just talking about reminding LGBTQ people that God does not favor them and reminding women of their place, that they need to be submitted to men.  That's not misogynistic.  That's not archaic.  That's countercultural.  Sure.  Dale fancies himself brave enough to carry this idea through 2020.  This is an opinion video.  You can have your own opinion.  But it is my personal belief that men like Dale are drawn to biblical literalism Because it allows them to prop up their own insecurities about their masculinity under the guise of being blessed by God's word.

And that snake said, Eve, eat the apple in spite of what God said.  And she took that apple and ate it because she was so weak.  And that is why in 2020 women can't be trusted to make decisions.  And that's proof right there that you are not intellectually superior to me.  Secondly, I think you've inadvertently proven that women should lead.  You're saying that Eve fell because the prince of darkness, Lucifer, Satan, the master of manipulation, coaxed her into eating the apple.  Then all she had to do was turn around with her boobs out, ask Adam if he wants a bite, and he took it.  You make Adam sound weak as hell.  Oh my goodness, I wasn't expecting to be this sassy, but I can't help it.  I am so anti-Dale Partridge ministry, if you cannot tell.  And if you're still wondering why, don't worry.  I have more examples of him diminishing women.  His Instagram post goes on to say, Your wife is not to be outsourced to the Sunday church service as her primary source of biblical teaching.  She is not to be left on her own scrounging for the spiritual scraps thrown out by podcast pastors or authors or YouTube videos.  Also, Dale refers to podcasts as spiritual scraps.  Do you know that podcasts feature thought leaders, experts, professors, scientists, visionaries, spiritual badasses, you name it, people at the top of their game, people with credentials, unlike Dale Partridge.  And Dale, why do you not want your wife to get this sort of education?  Are you afraid that women will be exposed to greater ideas, ideas that free them from your grasp?  one of the main reasons dale drives me so crazy is that he presents the most coercive manipulative oppressive ideas with this sweet and syrupy vibe.  he takes photos on his instagram and brags about how well he loves his wife but he is a textbook manipulator and you might say here but brenda dale is justified in everything he says ephesians 5 22. it's biblical to submit to your husband.  To that I'd say, Dale promoted a post by a female friend in which this woman is talking about her submission being so difficult that it's like she's a lamb to the slaughter. ",

            "text": "last week i commended paul for allowing morgan to be as vivacious as god made her to be.  but i say allow morgan to be vivacious because a lot of born again non-denominational churches promote this idea of female submission and i will say there are some people that fit into and even enjoy that dynamic.  a husband can lead his wife with love in a way that no one ends up crying in the shower wishing they could get a divorce but only if that relationship is not suppressing fundamental pieces of who that person is.  I, ironically, considering the tone of this video, actually do have a pretty Ephesians 522 relationship.  At the end of the day, I chose a partner that I trust, and I do submit to him when the situation calls for it.  This is a total stereotype, but I've noticed in my experience that men thrive when they feel respected, when their opinion counts.  You know, kind of how women feel when their opinion counts.  So I simply choose not to bulldoze my partner's opinion if it's something I can live with.  I may feel annoyed or a little worried.  it's not the right choice, but I do not feel that my partner is yanking my hair back exposing my neck and getting ready to slit my throat.  Ladies, seriously think about that.  What choice is that hard?  If we're giving up gossip or slander or cigarettes or anything that was already hurting us, We don't feel like lambs to the slaughter, but you do feel like you are bleeding out.  You are dying when someone is not allowing you to be the person that God created you to be.  And that is the irony of Christianity to me.  There are all these beautiful edifying stories in the Bible stories meant to ignite our passion and our curiosity for the divine.  But down here on planet earth, We've got small minded preachers that aim to rob the book of that intrigue, of that mystery, of that exploration, castrate it and make it something black and white.  And I already know how Dale will defend himself.  He has enough posts that are sugary sweet that do align with things that I believe in that you can point to and say, Hey, He doesn't look like such a bad guy.  I like his ministry.  I like what he's outputting.  First of all, as mentioned, it might be plagiarized from another source.  And second of all, it doesn't matter how many sweet or kind things you say outside of harping on female submission.  Maybe you, Dale, are practicing what you preach as in not forcing your wife to be something that makes her feel like a lamb to the slaughter.  But your words that may not hurt your wife or your family will hurt other people.  Men who are reveling in their own darkness will, instead of igniting their wives' dreams, extinguish them.  Or they'll convince them that they can't make decisions because they're inherently flawed, all because of da-da-da-da, Eve and her sin.  So yeah, I'm almost surprised by my sass in this one, but this guy has been bothering me for a while and... When I had my camera in front of me and decided to say something about it, this is how it came out.  And you may not share this opinion, especially people in Dale's close circle, but I can tell you that I have many messages from women and men.  There's actually a few particular men that keep reaching out to me saying how disgusted they are by Dale Partridge and his ministry.  And he's having that effect on people.  And that is honestly, I believe, due to discernment.  I'm smelling what Dale's cooking and it smells rotten.  I don't like it.  The last thing I'll say is don't troll Dale.  You are all warriors for the truth and defending the weak and the people that are oppressed.  I love you, love you, love you for it.  But if you so desire to make a comment on Dale's page, just please try to make it something productive, something that will lead to conversation, something that doesn't immediately create this us versus them mentality.  And I do know that the people I talk about are real and that he has real children and a real family and he may be emotionally hurt by a video like this.  And I don't know.  I still go back to sorry.  I'm not sorry because the way he speaks about women, the way he diminishes our ability to even comprehend things is just profoundly gross.  and again i'm not bashing on men.  please go check out the god is great podcast.  today you will hear from a man who has his own ministry that's doing it in a beautiful edifying way a way that edifies and uplifts all sexes and that's it.  please like subscribe share with your friends donate to my patreon or venmo if you can.  i love you all so much god bless.
