He said, yes, there's no difference between the Democrats and Republicans.  They maintain the same order.  They both enjoyed bombing my... bombing my country.  Paraphrasing.  And then he says, not an argument.  Actually, it is.  When you're trying to show that there's very little difference between the Democrats and the Republicans, showing how they're both imperialist warmongers despite your completely insane perception that somehow the Democrats are progressive actually is quite relevant.  I mean, the fact that this privileged Beverly... Not even just, like, privileged First World, but, like, the privileged of the First World.  on top of that, Mr.  Beverly Hills, actually insulting a Third World cadre, saying that his experience of, you know, his family, whatnot, or his country being bombed doesn't matter.  It's ridiculous.  I mean, if you could come up with a better symbol for First Worldism... I'd like to see it.  Because in my opinion, that's it right there.  Literally shut up third world person.  My desire for whatever benefits it is you think you're going to get from the Democrats trumps you not getting bombed. ",
