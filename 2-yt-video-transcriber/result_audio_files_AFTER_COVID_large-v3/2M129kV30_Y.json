She was able to jump in her car and speed off.  However, within 24 hours, that's the video, the news clipping that you've seen of that.  She was already shot twice.  and flying down the street and eventually crashed and succumbed to her injuries.  I don't know how old she was.  This happened yesterday, February 18th, when police found her suffering from a gunshot wound.  She later was pronounced dead.  According to social media, death was over a beef of a man she knew personally.  Jane exposed a man using a mess around with as a homosexual on Facebook.  She had several posts outside the ones that you guys seen that she tried to extort him for $5,000.  She accused a man of having sex with his male cousin.  She also had several other posts.  Keep acting like you don't know.  I actually seen her Facebook page yesterday and she had the exposing of dude picture in her background.  Somebody must have taken that picture off.  A lot of times you see when somebody passes, the family has the Facebook page taken down.  However, hers is not.  But some of the posts are taken down.  You can see this one, February 7th.  This content isn't available right now.  Indianapolis woman killed hours after exposing two DL goons.  Keep acting like you don't know.  Right, this was the one.  Now people understand just like children understand social media.  is not the time and the place to air out dirty laundry to even expose what the hell you're doing.  I can't count how many Facebook posts I watch and they're talking about what they did last night, who they did it with and when they're doing it.  This is not the time and place.  If you want to text your friends and tell them what you did last night, how you did it, when you did it, that's fine.  But social media is not the place.  Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, not the place.  People are saying, rest in peace, beautiful woman, you didn't deserve to be killed.  God come to your family.  I have not seen on how old she is.  I see we have four mutual friends though, but This is going viral.  A lot of people... And you know, some people think this is funny.  Some people think stuff like this is funny.  It is not funny.  But however, there's people out there, even with men and women, which is disgusting and passing around diseases.  But, ladies, men, everyone... Be careful, be easy.
