I mean, if you got time to go outside to nibble on some shrubbery, at least take some dancing lessons.  It's the least you could do for everyone involved in chat.  My God.  You ever run into a junkie on the street that thought they were a superhero?  It was the same exact thing I was seeing here, baby.  I've been to some sketchy nightclubs.  This person's partner was also involved in some controversy.  You know, you ever just see like a dumpster fire in your life?  That's what this is.  This is a pure dumpster fire.  I can't turn away.  The more that unfolds, the more wackiness it becomes.  Sophia talked about this.  By the way, Sophia is trans.  So I think that should say that there's some validity to the nuttiness that's going on.  When someone in the trans community is going, whoa, these trans people are a little nutty.  But if you say that, I think it's hate speech now because we live in that time.  Pretty soon, you won't even be able to have bad thoughts.  They're just going to put a chip in your head, and they're like, Stu?  Stewie?  Stewie, was that adrenaline I saw in your urine today?  Have you been having fun on the weekends?  Is this not fun enough for you, Stewie?  So basically this person, Liz, says that they came in second place and they're also a Twitch ambassador.  Second place finisher, Twitch Rivals Apex Legends TwitchCon 2019.  Here to tell you that mandatory voice chat in competitive games gives marginalized communities a distinct disadvantage by forcing them to choose between silence or abuse.  I don't think anyone could tell you're gay over voice chat unless you're really camp, as they say over the pond.  Or as we say here in America, a little bit fruity.  Is fruity a bad word, Stu?  Can I say fruity?  Because you can say fruity pebbles.  You can say fruity delicious.  But I guess the context of Fruity is probably bad now.  Well, alright, alright.  Alright, let's... If you, um... How the hell did you say it?  That wouldn't offend someone today.  That's the trick here.  If you come off a little feminine... I mean, if you come in there and go, Oh my god, you guys.  I just picked up a dude off Grindr.  You might catch a little flack, maybe.  I don't know.  But then again, I play with a gay guy every now and then.  Hell, I played, like, Overwatch competitive matches with Till.  He's gay.  Nobody cared Till was gay.  What the hell is this?  In fact, I waited for Till to say something.  You know, we'd be in a match, and then, like, he'd shoot somebody in the head, and then he'd make an analogy to a Mariah Carey song, which is why I thought Till was straight for a long time, because he really loved Mariah Carey, right?  And he thought I was gay because my knowledge of drag history is a little suspect.  I'm not going to lie.  You know, I know who I am, honey.  I'm not ashamed of me.  Anyway, nobody cared Till was gay.  But, you know, according to these people, Till should have been afraid to speak to us and tell us about gay life issues.  So Warchat comes in and he goes, I'm confused here.  As a person involved in Apex Legends Esports, I went through the TwitCon, oh, Wikipedia, I believe.  I probably read that wrong.  I went through all the TwitCon pages and couldn't find this person on a second place in EU or NA.  I even went through group placements to check, but nothing.  Can someone tell me what cup this was?  Oh, my.  Second place overall elimination in Apex Rivals.  Not too bad.  If true, this is not how second place in tournaments works.  Oh, Warcraft or Warchat, you are a bigot.  He's a bigot.  How dare you marginalize this person's accomplishments.  I hope they cancel you, War Chat.  You're a monster.  Invite us to the next one, Twitch Esports.  We know how to put on a show.  Hearts?  Oh, I bet you do.  And that show is probably boring as hell.  Can I say that?  Can I say that these people lack personality?  Or is that like an attack?  Because I don't know anymore.  My God.  Put on a show.  I've watched the Twitch streams.  The real show, the real star of this show is Steph, because I know Steph has got to be on some sort of drug.  This is something I invented called the pixie dance.  I think I was about eight when I told my dad, you know, I'd like to be a fairy.  Pixie dust is a hell of a drug.  I go outside, and then I go to my dealer, Billy Crystal Meth, and he gives me pixie dust.  And I eat some grass, and I do the pixie dust, and woo, you better be afraid of me, haters.  I'm more than a little sad that nobody acknowledged that accomplishment, to be honest.  Honored mention would have been nice, at least.  Queen, you didn't win.  You didn't win.  You didn't even place.  You need to be, like, congratulated for being part of the... So you did well in some eliminations, but overall, you didn't win.  You can have the fastest lap in a motorcycle race, but if you didn't place in the top three, nobody gives a shit.  Can I say that still?  Lizen, a Twitch ambassador and my ex-teammate, lied about our performance at TwitchCon 2019 Apex Tournament.  And when I calmly corrected the facts, she came to harass me.  I don't even, I didn't even disagree with you.  Really now?  The people who don't like harassment harass people.  Wow. ",

So basically, we get a couple more tweets from this fantastic Twitch ambassador who then berates and attacks people that disagree with her.  I don't see anything disrespectful here, especially about a guy just basically going, well, if you don't like Twitch chat, you know, or chat in general, you can mute.  You know, back in the old days of Call of Duty 4, the first Modern Warfare, those days were raw.  These people today could not survive on Xbox Live when it first came out.  Do you remember that?

Nobody wants to take away your voice chat.  You f***ing illiterate f***ing wow.  It's... Dude.  This chick is acting like DSP, bro.  Like, for real.  They should have just gave DSP the job.  He would have been perfect for the Twitch ambassador because he's handling things about as well as she is.  Whew.  Lord have mercy.

Anyway, basically, Twitch put out this note for the Safety Advisory Council after this entire dumpster fire just blew up.  The dumpster fire blew up and then burned down an orphanage.  That's how bad it got.  Twitch basically in this thing, because I'm going to paraphrase it for you because we've been here long enough, says that the people that are ambassadors and on the Safety Council, their opinions do not reflect Twitch, Twitch staff, or anyone employed by Twitch.  They're kind of like independent actors or contractors.  So it's an interesting sort of like we distance ourselves from them, but not really.  It's almost like some sort of weird double talk.  I guess Twitch is laying the groundwork there just in case this gets a little bit more wild.  Stu, never zoom in on my face again.  This is nightmare fueled.  Zoom out, Stu!  Thanks, Stewie.  Let's get the hell out of here.  Once again, thank you for showing up to this trash fire.  that is my channel.

You don't like something?  Fuck it.  The secret to life is minimizing how much bullshit you're involved with.  Wink.  Or at least laughing at the dumpster fire.  burn down.  That's my personal belief system.  But you know, what you gonna do?  Let's do a little dancing as this thing scrolls across.  I need a drink, Stu. ",
