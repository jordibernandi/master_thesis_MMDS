            "text": "Damn, Money Man, let's go.  They already took the life that you had.  And then when you come out, they already got a plan together to fuck you up.  They know y'all been doing silly shit.  They know y'all been running around taking this challenge and that challenge and just having a good old time and trying to deal.  They know that.  Why they been plotting and planning and shit.  Y'all ain't see that coming?  Not fucking around coalition to ask y'all to do one thing.  We ask y'all to do one thing just to demonstrate that we can all get on one accord.  You see, how can he trust you with something as huge as liberating your people if he can't trust you with something as tiny as represent a cause for 24 hours, 48 hours, a week?  I ask every one of y'all that believe that what I'm saying to be true just for 24 hours to change your logo.  When the motherfuckers went over there and bombed Paris, y'all ain't have no problem putting.  stay up, pray for Paris.  Y'all quick to jump on anybody else bandwagon but your own.  Why?  Because you think your wagon is raggedy?  Why?  Because you think that they don't deserve for you to lift it up?  Why?  Because you ashamed of your people?  Let me help y'all out real quick.  You should hold your head up higher than anybody else.  You have done shit that they can't even figure out.  You have done shit that they don't even have the technology to begin to even imitate.  You have written shit that they can't decipher.  You have known shit about the stuff they just discovered.  You invented shit that they still use today.  You are the creator of businesses that they don't stole and they eating off of.  You have taught them how to dance.  You don't taught them how to rap.  You don't taught them how to play sports.  You taught them how to wash their ass.  You taught them how to stand up.  Ladies, don't get mad.  The reason that you have a booty is because you are a bipedal creature that needs those gluteus maximus to walk upright.  But when you walk around on all fours, You don't have an ass.  But when someone stands you up, you look like now they're trying to get like you.  They want your DNA.  Don't you realize that you should hold your head up as a people and have high racial esteem?  Because we all know you have high personal esteem, but you have low racial esteem.  That's why you always talking down to the black man.  I love my comedians.  But comedians, when you start making fun of your own people in front of people who don't know your people, they don't look at it that way.  They think that you are reinforcing what they already believe about you.  That's why I salute my man Dave Chappelle, because he told it like it was.  And the truth hurt the same way.  they disconnected me when I got a little too hot for y'all.  I want y'all to understand that no matter where you are across the African diaspora, that I'm talking to you.  Y'all always claim that y'all want to be together.  I know where most of us are.  I know the populations.  Don't make me tell you where all the black people are.  See, they don't even want you to know how many of y'all it is.  They want you to think that it's a handful over here, that it's a few over there, and that we are more than y'all.  They like to call you the minority.  Minority is an insulting word because they're trying to bring you down.  They use the word minority because they want you to think that they're the majority.  That's bullshit.  I know in Brazil, we got over 55 million black folks.  In the United States, we have 46 million black folks.  Haiti, they sitting on 8 million black folks.  Dominican Republic, y'all sitting on about 7 million black folks.  4 million.  France, they got 5.5 million.  Listen, man, I can go on there.  Jamaica got 2 million.  United Kingdom, the UK got 2 million.  Canada got 1 million.  Mexico got a million.  Cuba got a million.  Italy got a million.  Spain got a million.  Listen, Puerto Rico got 900,000.  Peru got 800,000.  Ecuador got a million.  Trinidad and Tobago got motherfucking 600,000.  Do I have to keep going?  We every motherfucking where and we ain't in no small motherfucking numbers.  But isn't it ironic that the place with the number one and the number two largest black populations, which is Brazil and the United States, are the two where they are trying to eliminate us the most.  I'm going to let that float in the air because somebody need to hear that.  And you mean to tell me that a brother has asked all of those millions of people in each one of those countries to stand up and unify and fight back against what is being done to us to no longer tolerate the oppression?  That we're not a formidable force?  Y'all, the Honorable Minister Louis Farrakhan asked y'all to give him 10,000 soldiers for the justice or else.  He never got that, but yet I got 25,000 of y'all who say y'all right now ready to ride or die.  If I can raise 25,000 in a week, damn it, that's over 70 million fucking people, 110 million on the other side.  What's wrong?  Don't y'all get it?  You are the team.  Listen, this is not about race.  This is about what you were told to do by your creator.  Call it what you want.  You can call it a war.  You can call it a jihad.  You can call it a holy war.  Or you can call it what it is.  It is what was written to happen in the very last days.  Don't make me open the books in here because it tells you how we were gonna be.  Not the book of Revelations.  You see, they put that back in for you because it's hard to understand.  But what I'm telling you is simple because you can go look it up yourself and it tells you how we were going to be.  It tells you how men and women were going to be.  It tells you that our morals would be gone.  It tells you that we will have no value.  It even tells you good women stop because it says that the men will be so weak in your time that they don't go after the easy women because they don't want to do the work to become a brother worthy enough to be your man.  That's in the book.  All of these things it says.  It talks about the wealth.  It talks about the disproportionate.  It talks about abortion.  It talks about everything that we're doing today.  It talks about it.  It said when this time comes, you'll know.  And for y'all who don't get it, don't worry.  I'm going to make you start having dreams.  I'm going to make you start having visions.  Y'all know some people sitting out there right now.  They're having some crazy ass dreams and wondering where they came from.  Like something about to happen.  Y'all got people spraying the skies because they don't want you to see the signs that he said he was sent.  The enemy busy.  And this ain't no red devil running around with a pit fork.  It's the people that's doing shit to you.  Now, I've held y'all too long.  And I came to you because I felt the need to speak to y'all this morning.  Hold it together.  Don't let them sway you with this programming of the media.  Don't believe that shit.  Them peoples out in many did just what they were supposed to do last night.  They just didn't pick up no guns.  Now we watched and we let the people that we knew was going to show up have their time in the sun.  Thank y'all for showing us where this motherfucker lives.  Ain't nothing changed from my original announcement.  I just find it very, very interesting that they never do nothing until we show the fuck up.  Because they know that, yeah, we might lose a few, but y'all will lose a few too.  Because that's combat.  And if we can walk the streets of Iraq, if we can walk the streets of Afghanistan, if we can walk the streets of Bosnia, if we can walk the streets of Somalia, then we can walk the streets of America and treat y'all the same way.  Y'all wanted combat gear.  So how about a combat ready adversary?  Because that's your worst nightmare.  Energize the people around me because I'm just an arm of the octopus.  We got another Day before we get into the weekend.  It's gonna be an interesting weekend.  I want to salute everybody out in Minneapolis.  I want to salute everybody out in LA.  What the fuck the rest of y'all waiting on?  Brazil what you waiting on?  Haiti, Dominican Republic, Colombia, France, Jamaica, the UK, Canada, Mexico.  What y'all waiting on?  Cuba, what you waiting on?  Italy, Spain, Puerto Rico, Peru, Germany, Ecuador.  What y'all waiting on?  I mean, I'm just trying to figure out what y'all waiting on.  What else do y'all waiting on?  What y'all waiting on?  Because let me know, so I'll wait with you.  Because I don't see nothing else to motherfucking.  wait on at this point.  Diplomacy appears to have fucking broken down.  Now, I don't give a fuck who you are, how much money you got, how much education you got, where you came up in society, or how much pool you got, but you do equivalent to what you can do.  Some people can't do everything you can do.  They don't have the resources you have, so you should be able to do more.  Don't keep coming with lip service.  Okay, I'm gonna let y'all know and I keep saying it publicly.  I'm just like Malcolm when he says white people, you cannot be a part of this.  You can help us by talking to your own fucking people, but we don't want you.  It's not what you can do.  This ain't this.  Look, look, look.  Go talk to your folks.  Go talk to your peoples since y'all always want to help the fuck out.  And I don't want nobody who doesn't have some degree of melanin in them trying to speak for my people.  Period.  There is no if and a buts about it.  You need us.  We don't need you.  If every black person in America was to pack they shit up and we had to exodus out this motherfucker, this whole country would collapse.  If every black person on earth refused to buy from any other race and just traded amongst ourselves, every other economy would collapse.  Don't y'all understand?  you're the legs of the fucking table?  So hold your head up a little higher.  Stop letting people talk to you any goddamn kind of way.  You can say, look, motherfucker, this is a free country.  I say what the fuck I want to say and the way I want to say it.  And if you touch me, you don't know who in here got my back.  We got to get to a place where everybody got everybody's motherfucking back.  Y'all sitting around hating on each other, but you pussy in the face of the motherfucker.  that really is your enemy.  I'm going to say it and y'all know what I'm going to say.  You don't want to see us.  You're not going to see us until you open the door first.  We've already shown you a little bit of us.  Now show us some of you.  And by doing that, you are already a member of the NFAC.  Because that's really what it's about.  Now, if you ain't about that life, I got to give this disclaimer every time.  If you're not about that life, if you don't care about what we got to do to fix everything, if you don't give a damn about group economics, if you don't give a damn about reestablishing the black communities, if you don't give a damn about establishing our own black laws, if you don't give a damn about us maybe being able to police the police, you don't give a damn about us having our own school system, teaching our history, our real history.  Our history didn't start in 1619.  Matter of fact, like I told somebody the other day, motherfucker, don't talk to me about black history.  I am black history.  If y'all don't want to do none of that, then y'all, you know, y'all stay in the house and stay out the way because you're scary.  You know what I'm saying?  If you don't want to do nothing about the continued colonization of our places that we call home.  Y'all don't want to do nothing about the infusion of immigrants into your areas, taking your money for their own buildup.  Y'all don't want to do nothing about the ADAS issue.  Y'all don't want us to get some place where we can get some therapy for post-traumatic slave disorder.  Y'all still want to integrate into a burning house.  You know, then I have to say.  That's you.  You do you.  OK, because I'm a remember you, too.  I'm gonna remember that you, you, you, you got too much ignorance.  I'm gonna remember that you, you too comfortable.  I'm gonna remember that you had too much self hatred.  I'm gonna remember that you had too much, uh, you was affected with the slave mentality.  I'm gonna remember that you was, you had too much white blood in you.  That's what I'm gonna remember.  So when we come through, just remember what they said, get behind me.  I never knew you.  So to the children.  And to the righteous.  And to the elect.  Who know who they are.  Because their ancestors are speaking to you.  Yes we know you awake.  But now it's time for us to separate.  The children.  From the grown ups.  Because grown ups are going to handle their business.  And children are going to wait for someone else.  To handle their business.  I bid you all.  A blessing.  I bid you all.  The continued protection of Yahweh.  I bid you all.  that we will have a chance to talk again.  And I bid you all the backbone and the energy you need to find to go out and make some noise where you at.  Let them know they don't upset the whole jelly bean.  The whole table is shaking.  Go out today and let them know, look, fuck all that marching and singing, but I just want to let you know how I feel about the situation.  I want y'all to go out and let them know that shit that happened in Minneapolis, yeah, that was fucked up, but we want to let you know, bro, not today.  Matter of fact, we don't want to see you on the street.  Matter of fact, take Dale.  We got this, because you're fucked up to the point that it's not going to be good if you come around.  Stop standing around and get down.  Remember what somebody has quoted me is now saying.  I saw the meme the other day.  The revolution won't be televised, but a damn show will be posted.  And I bid you all a farewell.  I hope we get to talk again.  I'll see y'all real soon.  Shabbat Shalom.  As-Salaam-Alaikum.  Bless you.  Peace.  Talk to y'all later.  Stay black if nothing else.  And remember.  Everybody in my skin ain't my king, and everybody that's my friend don't necessarily look like me. ",
