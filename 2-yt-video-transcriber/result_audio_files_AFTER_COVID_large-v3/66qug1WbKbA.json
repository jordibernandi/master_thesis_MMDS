Thinks that he can order somebody out of town because they won't give ID even when they don't lawfully have to give ID.  This is what's wrong with our police today.  They take an oath and they ignore it.  They're on power trips, and when they don't get their egos smoothed over, padded, they get butt hurt.  We see it time and time again.  And this one, even though he knows what's going on, and states he knows what's going on, and knows that he's wrong, he's gonna order Travis Hines out of town.  He's gonna give him two minutes to get out of town.  So let's get on with the video. ",

And not once did he say you're parked illegally or you can't camp out on the streets at night.  There's a city ordinance.  Never one mention of a crime.  Sergeant Nadeau is a tyrant.  He's a bully.  He completely thrown his oath out the door.  just for ego just for power trip.  so because sergeant nadu is such a jerk i'm going to post the contact information and i'm going to hope some of the other channels jump on this because this is acceptable for a nice term and sergeant and they do Needs to hear about it.
