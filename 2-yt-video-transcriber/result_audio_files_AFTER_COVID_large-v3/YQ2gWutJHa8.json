Meanwhile, night two of the Republican National Convention featured Melania Trump and Mike Pompeo.  Can you guess how one was criticized for breaking federal rules and which was being secretly recorded by a former friend?  And lastly, more states are fighting back as the Trump administration monkey wrenches the United States Postal Service.  Now New York, New Jersey, and Hawaii have filed a lawsuit in federal court. ",

            "text": "An old white man shot into a mixed race crowd of some 50 civil rights marchers in rural Pennsylvania on Monday night, though the incident wasn't reported by local media until yesterday.  Police did not release the shooter's name, but said in a press release that two men were being questioned at state police barracks in small town Bedford.  Marchers are on a pilgrimage from Milwaukee, Wisconsin to Washington,  D.C.,  a journey of nearly 800 miles on foot.  Before the shooting, the marchers had taken a break and were preparing to climb a hill.  Witness Tori Lowe said marchers caught sight of a man looking out a door, but had no time to react before he began shooting at them from behind.  Lowe said in a Facebook live stream that the man fired at least seven shots from a long gun.  Quote, he just came out shooting.  There was nothing we could do, unquote, Lowe said.  One marcher was hit in the face.  He was reportedly in stable condition yesterday at a nearby hospital.  Police said an argument preceded the shooting, but witnesses disputed that account.  According to Lowe, quote, it was no argument.  The video is proof, unquote.  The marchers set out for Milwaukee on August 4th.  At least two were arrested on charges of blocking traffic earlier along the route in Indiana.  They hope to arrive at the Lincoln Monument in D.C.  by Friday, which marks the 57th anniversary of Martin Luther King  Jr.'s.  I Have a Dream speech.  How little has changed.  Breaking form, Donald Trump yesterday praised CNN for running the opening night of the Republican National Convention more or less uninterrupted.  But what he didn't mention was that ratings were down 28% for the RNC compared to 2016.  That's according to the Los Angeles Times.  and about 3 million fewer people watched it than watched the Democratic National Convention last week.  Last night was the second of four nights of planned programming by the Republicans.  There was no coverage of how Trump has moved more than $2 million in contributions to his campaign, from those accounts to his private companies, as Forbes reported yesterday.  There were, in contrast to the Democratic convention, no past presidents speaking on Trump's behalf.  But there was scandal aplenty.  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke to the convention from the U.S.  Embassy in Jerusalem.  Career diplomats were appalled by the decision, according to CBS News.  The Foreign Service has strict guidelines about political activity, which Pompeo ignored.  But we couldn't put it better than Democratic Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, who said, quote, If there's one thing this administration has shown us, it's a willingness to break the law in broad daylight.  Mike Pompeo's participation in the RNC as Secretary of State, from foreign soil no less, isn't just inappropriate, it's illegal, unquote.  Trump's wife, Melania, also spoke from the recently renovated White House Rose Garden.  But what's more interesting is that Melania is reportedly on tape dissing various Trump world figures.  The tapes were surreptitiously recorded by her former friend and advisor, Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, who has a book coming out soon titled Melania and Me.  It's billed as a tell-all.  We'll let you know the dirt as soon as it's available. ",

It's the third lawsuit over DeJoy's disruptions of postal operations.  Pennsylvania and Washington State led two multi-state lawsuits that were filed last week.  All three lawsuits alleged DeJoy made the changes without getting them cleared by the postal regulator or seeking public comment as required by Congress, Bloomberg News reported.  In addition to Trump and DeJoy, the new lawsuit led by New York Attorney General James also names the Postal Service itself as a defendant.  In a statement yesterday, James said, quote, The USPS slowdown is nothing more than a voter suppression tactic.  Yet this time... These authoritarian actions are not only jeopardizing our democracy and fundamental right to vote, but the immediate health and financial well-being of Americans across the nation, unquote.  The lawsuits seek court orders to prevent further changes, in addition to undoing the changes DeJoy already made.  Meanwhile, more videos emerged from around the country showing discarded mail sorting machines and postal drop boxes being removed.  They're not even really trying to hide this election interference.  It's all so damn brazen. ",

Winds are forecast to be in excess of 100 miles per hour, and there is a risk of flash flooding as well.  Stay safe, stay dry, and if you're planning on using one of the official shelters, the authorities ask that you bring two masks for each person, plus hand sanitizer along with the rest of your emergency kit.  The Kremlin yesterday rejected claims by German doctors that Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was poisoned with a nerve agent.  Navalny fell ill last Thursday while on a flight from Serbia to Moscow.  His allies are calling for a criminal inquiry and say they don't trust results from the Russian hospital that found no basis for the poisoning claim.  The New York Times reports that American colleges and universities are cracking down hard on students who hold parties in violation of coronavirus restrictions.  Suspensions of individual students, as well as entire fraternities and sororities, are already in the hundreds.  Outbreaks stemming from parties are a real problem.  The Times have counted 23,000 COVID cases on 750 campuses since the pandemic kicked off last winter.  Jerry Falwell Jr.  formerly resigned the presidency of Liberty University yesterday amid a sex scandal.  Falwell accidentally copied university leadership on an email with pictures of his wife having sex with a pool boy, reportedly an activity the right-wing Christian leadership enjoyed observing several times per year.  After the pool boy confirmed the relationship, Falwell said he was resigning, then changed his mind, then changed his mind again.  And here we are. ",
