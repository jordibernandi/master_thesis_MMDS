I was the CEO of the joint venture company, and the Chinese were buying access to the White House.  And the big guy in the emails is Joe Biden, and he was taking a 50% cut.  So Just like the last debate with Hillary Clinton, where we brought the women who had been raped or sexually assaulted by Bill Clinton to the debate, to the actual site of the debate.  yesterday, there was a big upset for Joe Biden.  And that will continue because today that individual will be presenting the three phones he used in that business with all the evidence of the corruption to the Senate with regards to what happened on the debate stage.  He committed suicide.  Joe Biden committed political suicide.  At the end of the debate, he said, oh, I'm in favor of fracking.  You know, I had I've never said anything about fossil fuels being bad.  And if you've got that video, Mr.  President, put it on your Web site.  Well, we have the video.  He has said at his pathetic town halls and his pathetic.  micro rallies that we are going to get rid of for all fossil fuels.  And then at the end of the debate said, yeah, we're going to transition into sustainable energy.  Well, he just lost Pennsylvania.  He just lost Texas.  He lost all those states where we make a huge business exporting energy from America, Mike. ",

You know, I'm always very impressed with that when I go there, because, you know, you can have as many electric cars as you like in Europe.

The fact is this president has done something remarkable.  I don't know if your listeners are aware of that.  In the first time ever in our republic's history, the United States, because of our allowing fracking to occur, has become a net exporter of energy.  We are selling more energy than we need, and that's great for business.  And Joe Biden just said, I'm going to kill it all. ",

We have one individual, my boss, Donald Trump, who was a billionaire before he ran for public office and then lost money when he became president.

He gives it back to the federal government because he said, I'm not here to make money.  On the other hand, you've got a guy who's been in politics for 47 years on a government paycheck who has villas, who has houses, who has summer homes.  And in the first year he left office, his declared income in 2017 was $17 million.  Now, How did that happen?  And did he pay taxes on the money, the cuts that we now know he was given with those deals to China?  Did he pay taxes on those deals?  We now know yesterday, thanks to Tony Boblinsky, this naval officer who was part of those companies, a five, just one transaction.  The communist partner.  The communist Chinese partner gave the Biden family, not Hunter Biden, Mike, the Biden family, a $5 million unsecured forgivable loan.  What is an unsecured forgivable loan?  It's a bribe.
