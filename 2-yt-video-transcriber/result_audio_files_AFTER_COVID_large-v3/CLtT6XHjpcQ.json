            "text": "Shalom, I'm Messianic Rabbi Zev Porat, and welcome to a special outreach update from Jerusalem, Israel.  We're living in exciting and prophetic times.  There's never been a generation closer to the second coming of Jesus Yeshua than this generation.  We're not setting any dates, but we know that the time is near.  We know that the veil is being lifted, 2 Corinthians 3, verse 16, and Jews are being saved like never before.  In the midst of the lockdown here in Israel, our ministry has a permit to travel as we're doing humanitarian aid, helping people in need with food vouchers, and in the process are able to go out and to preach the gospel.  Praise Yeshua.  There are several ways that people can go out during a lockdown.  One of the ways is to go to a synagogue.  up to 20 people to pray outside.  And we are witnessing to those people on the way to the synagogue and on the way back from the synagogue.  People are also permitted to go out to buy food.  And there also we have an opportunity to witness to the people.  So God has opened several doors for the gospel to go forth.  No one can lock the gospel down.  we will not be intimidated by the covet 19 or anything.  god did not give us a spirit of fear.  second timothy chapter 1 verse 7. for god has not given us a spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind.  now is the time for the gospel to go forth full force.  in the midst of this panic in the midst of people being afraid of death We're preaching Psalm 68, verse 20.  Our God is a God of salvation, and escape from death belongs to the Lord God.  And in Hebrew, it reads like this.  Our God is a God of Yeshua, because the word for salvation in Hebrew is Jesus Yeshua.  Our God is a God of Yeshua, and escape from death belongs to the Lord God.  We have had many salvations during the COVID-19 using this Bible verse.  Praise Yeshua, Jesus God.  As the team were praying, I began to preach in Jerusalem.  A religious Orthodox man was approaching.  I introduced myself, Shalom.  He introduced himself as Rafi Levi, a yeshiva student, about to graduate to become a rabbi next year.  I asked Rafi, where are you going?  He said, I'm on the way to the synagogue.  Would you like to come and join me?  We urgently need to get there, he said.  I asked Rafi, why do we urgently need to get there?  He said, don't you see what happens here in Israel and around the world?  Can't you see that they closed us down in the feasts and people are dying?  We need God, Rafi said.  I asked Rafi, which God do we need?  He said, there's only one God.  Elohe Avraham Yitzhak V'Yakov, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.  I said, Amen.  I asked Rafi, but do you know this God?  He said, what do you mean?  I'm on the way to the synagogue and I'm about to graduate to be a rabbi.  But do you know God, Rafi?  Do you seek his face?  Rafi was puzzled at the question.  I then pulled out the Bible and read together with Rafi.  2 Chronicles 7, verse 14.  If my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, I will forgive their sin, and I will heal their land.  This is the only way God is going to hear your prayers and not only heal you now and protect you, but heal you for eternity.  Would you like to escape death for eternity?  Rafi said yes.  It was supernatural.  This Orthodox Jew that was on the way to the synagogue in a hurry was now fascinated by the word of God.  Praise Yeshua.  The power of the Holy Spirit was working.  I then turned the Bible to Tehillim, Psalms, chapter 68, verse 20, and read together with Rafi.  Our God is a God of salvation and escape from death belongs to the Lord God.  When Raphael read this, he was in shock because in Hebrew it reads like this.  Our God is a God of Yeshua because the word for salvation in Hebrew is Yeshua, Jesus.  Our God is a God of Yeshua, and escape from death belongs to the Lord God.  When Raffi heard this, he was in complete shock.  He couldn't move.  Once again as he was standing, I read Psalm 68 verse 20 to him in Hebrew.  Our God... is a God of salvation and escape from death belongs to the Lord God.  When Raffi read this together with me, he finally said, this is impossible.  Let me see the Bible.  He took the Bible and read it.  His eyes couldn't believe what he's reading.  He said, I've been studying to be a rabbi.  I've never seen this before.  How could it be?  He held his head and was saying, oh, I can't believe this in Hebrew.  It was supernatural.  The word of God was shaking Raffi.  I then asked Raffi, Do you want this eternal life?  Do you want to escape death forever?  Huffy said, yes, but this can't be.  It was time for the full gospel.  There's only one way and one that died on the tree on the cross for your sins and rose on the third day and conquered death once and for all.  I turned the Bible to Psalms 49 verse 15 and read, but God will redeem me from the realm of the dead.  He will surely take me to himself.  I then read Isaiah 53 verse Psalms 2 and many passages with Rafi.  Rafi said this is too much for me to grasp.  I'm scared.  I told Rafi all of us have fallen short of the glory but through him we become righteous.  through him Messiah Yeshua we have eternal life.  do not be afraid.  Isaiah 41 verse 10. so do not fear for I am with you.  do not be dismayed for I am your God.  I will strengthen you and help you.  I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.  Only He can make us righteous.  Don't be afraid.  Yeshua is calling you today.  The fact that you and I met today is not a coincidence.  The word coincidence is not in the Bible.  This is a divine appointment.  Glory to Yeshua, Jesus.  Raffi asked, For contact information, we pray that he will contact the ministry and they'll have dreams and visitations that Yeshua Jesus is the Messiah and call on him as the King of Kings and Lord of Lords.  We continue to share the gospel with many.  And for Zion's sake, we will not keep silent.  Isaiah 62, verse 1.  For Zion's sake, I will not keep silent.  For Jerusalem's sake, I will not remain quiet.  Till her vindication shines out like the dawn, her salvation like a blazing torch.  In Hebrew, her Yeshua like a blazing torch.  Let's continue to stand together as the one new man, Ephesians 2.15.  Work the harvest together.  Bring the gospel back to Jerusalem and go home.  Until next time, I'm Messianic Rabbi Zev Porat, sending you blessings from Jerusalem, Israel, in the mighty name of the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, Jesus Yeshua.  Amen.  Every knee shall bow and every tongue will confess that Yeshua is Lord.  Hallelujah. ",
