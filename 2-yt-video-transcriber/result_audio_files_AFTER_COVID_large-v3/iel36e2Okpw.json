Around 3 million people from eight provinces have been affected.  Nearly 230,000 of them have been evacuated.  The water levels of about 150 rivers have also reached or exceeded local warning levels.  At least nine people have died and five are missing.  One house, built on a now waterlogged riverbank in Guangxi province, even collapsed on Wednesday after its foundation gave way and slid into the river.  In some areas, streets have turned into fast-flowing rivers.  Many cars are almost completely submerged.  The entrance of one shopping center is now impossible to access.  The floodwaters also left behind huge amounts of muddy water.  In one neighborhood, mud completely covers the ground.  Some houses have been destroyed, while landslides also damaged crops.  Chen Hong, a business owner in Guangxi province, told us her city has been underwater for almost one week.

            "text": "Ms.  Chen explained that a small dam in her county collapsed.  A Chinese netizen also reminded people online to be especially careful of small dams built within the last 20 years.  He said these dams were poorly constructed and often leak small amounts of water normally.  but added that during a flood, these dams will collapse.  One video shows residents who live close to one such dam leaving their homes out of fear that it could crumble.  Chinese state-run media outlets have only released a handful of reports on the disaster.  In recent days, the front page of the People's Daily, China's largest newspaper, didn't feature a single report on the flooding.  Instead, readers only see positive reports that praise the Communist Party or details on what party leaders are doing.  Online, China's Twitter equivalent Weibo also hardly featured the news.  Out of the platform's top 50 search terms, only one is about the floods.  Meanwhile, five of them condemn or criticize U.S.  actions or events, like the recent protests sweeping the country.  One Twitter user questioned why Chinese media continue to praise the so-called good life there, but don't show people who lost their homes and have been washed away by the flooding.  According to weather forecasts, central, northern and northeastern China will experience showers and heavy thunderstorms in the coming days.  Some areas may even face gale force winds.  According to one Taiwanese media outlet, a typhoon is expected to enter mainland China from Hong Kong in three days.  Elsewhere in northeastern China, locusts have emerged.  Despite theories that they may have come from elsewhere, they were found to have originated in the area.  Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces issued urgent warnings about combating the insects.  At least 4,100 acres have been hit.  According to local media, one to two locusts can be seen per square foot on average.  In the worst cases, five were found per square foot.  A video shows locusts were also found in a province in central China, but there is no report from local media to confirm it.  At the same time, the CCP virus epidemic in these two provinces has also worsened recently.  Northeast China produces about one-fifth of all of China's rice supplies every year.  Now to Hong Kong.  An inside source from China told us that a detention center in Shenzhen city has been cleared out in order to make room for detained Hong Kongers in the future.  The facility is over 40 miles away from Hong Kong.  We also called the detention center to confirm the clearance.  Beijing's so-called national security law on Hong Kong has prompted concerns about the future of the city's autonomy and its freedom.  Protests are expected to erupt when it takes effect in the coming months.  Hong Kong police are already setting up a special unit to enforce the new law.  And in Taiwan, the Taiwanese Air Force, say, drove off several Chinese Su-30 fighters on Tuesday after they briefly entered Taiwan's air defense identification zone.  China has been conducting military exercises southwest of Taiwan.  Beijing has threatened to use military force if Taiwan declares independence.  That's because China claims democratic Taiwan as its sovereign territory.  Australia is adopting a harder stance towards the Chinese Communist Party, or CCP.  On Wednesday, the party claimed Australia was being racist against Chinese students.  But a day later, Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison called China's claims rubbish, saying Australians will never trade their values in response to coercion from the CCP.  This is the first time Morrison has used the word coercion to describe the trade dispute with China.  That's after Australia tightened its rules for foreign investment a week ago to bolster national security.  Some Chinese companies will be impacted.  The European Union plans to investigate TikTok, a controversial but popular social media app, over its privacy policies and operation in Europe.  TikTok is owned by China-based company ByteDance, which is currently undergoing a U.S.  national security review.  Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne has reportedly borrowed heavily from the Bank of China in London, where he has two registered home mortgages.  His opposition says it puts him in a vulnerable position with the Chinese regime, especially amid escalating tensions between the two nations.  Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail reported that Champagne bought two apartments in London in 2009 and 2013.  At the time, he was working as an executive at a UK multinational construction and engineering firm.  The current balance for the mortgages stands at over $1 million.  Conservative Member of Parliament Garnett Genius called the mortgages very dangerous and says it could present a conflict of interest for the Foreign Affairs Minister.  But Champagne defended his position.  He said at the time he wasn't able to borrow from London banks, but added that he's always been transparent about the loans.  He's also noted that so far there haven't been any issues.  Twitter is banned in China, but the platform still sees a lot of pro-Beijing posts.  An analysis by the New York Times suggests the Chinese regime has launched a propaganda campaign on the platform.  The study found that in the recent weeks, over 4,500 accounts reposted a high volume of tweets from Chinese officials or Chinese state-run media.  These accounts are relatively new and were created within the last three months.  The analysis also found that some of the accounts were created around the same time.  tensions rose between the Chinese regime and the Trump administration.  One-third of the accounts were similarly created within the last three months, and one in seven of them has zero followers.  It wouldn't be the first time the Chinese regime launched a propaganda effort on the platform.  Last year, Twitter suspended over 200,000 accounts, citing large-scale misinformation from the regime.  These accounts were aimed at discrediting Hong Kong pro-democracy protesters.  The video conferencing company Zoom has come under fire.  A human rights group's account was shut down after an online event that commemorated the Tiananmen Square massacre.  NTD's Juliet Song reports. ",
