            "text": "Thank you.  Hello there, Steve here in Sydney, on the Lean Gnosis website, TrueBlueHelo.com.  You've just been listening to some of your favourite music, and I dare say that you've heard it internally for years or decades, and never quite knew what to do, but you really never had the time to question it.  Two things I'm going to tell you.  You are in fact being signalled.  That's something that you didn't notice because you were always in too much of a hurry.  And secondly, it's not part of your brain providing free elevator music.  It definitely is not.  And I'm going to tell you very quickly why and how to reframe your thinking a little bit to understand this internal musical signaling phenomenon.  Now when you hear this music internally there's a couple of things you can say about it.  It's sometimes quite weirdly out of context because you can be up a ladder knocking nails into a beam and you start hearing in your head beautiful ABBA music.  or maybe something that you've always remembered from childhood, Ave Maria or something like that.  And it's always out of context.  It can happen while you're in the bath.  It can happen and you sort of say, well, it's got nothing to do with what I'm doing at the moment.  It's out of context.  So why is it happening?  Now, This has been going on all of your life and you've been just too busy to take too much notice of it.  Okay?  We're all too busy today.  We suffer for it.  So make no bones about it.  You are being signaled.  You've just failed to respond.  Now, we give you a definition.  We call you a semi-gnostic.  That means you're receiving a signal.  You're knowing something.  Gnostic meaning knowing.  You're knowing something, but you're not responding.  You're sort of knowing subliminally.  You're not noticing sufficiently.  Agnostic means not knowing.  Gnostic means you do know.  So you're in the middle.  You're a semi-gnostic.  You sort of half know, but you're not responding.  Okay?  Now, how to clarify this mystery and learn how to respond is available in a 20-minute lecturette at TrueBlueHealer.com.  20-minute beginner's tour is all you have to do.  And here is a bonus.  While you're learning to shift your understanding of this situation slightly, you'll be given some physical evidence that is repeatable and is going to show you over and over again until you're convinced that you weren't paying enough attention for many, many years.  Okay?  So, where does the signalling come from?  It's your own internal divine spark.  Now, you've probably heard about that in literature but never paid much attention to it.  Last 20, 30 years, Your divine spark has decided to make itself physically knowable to you.  So you'll be able to feel your divine spark after you have visited TrueBlueHelo.com.  This is a free public service.  Okay, it costs you nothing.  And by the way, this is a totally natural process.  It benefits, improves the life of both secular people and religious people.  Okay.  You can be a religious Gnostic or you can be a secular Gnostic.  It just depends on what you prefer and how you've been brought up.  It's okay to be either.  And layman's Gnosis is for everybody, implied by its name.  It is literally for everybody.  There's no belief required in this because you'll be shown everything you need to know.  Physical evidence to back it up every step of the way.  Everyone finds this a most pleasant experience.  Some people want to keep it all to themselves.  Other people want to shout it from the rooftops.  Do whatever you want.  You don't have to talk to me.  You don't have to know me at all.  The site's fully automated.  There's an email link.  You can put questions to me.  And if I can't answer your question, then the music maker will.  So how's that for a free invitation to get to know what's causing your internal musical signaling?  Okay, so I'll leave you again now with your favorite music.  And I want you to pay more attention to when you hear internal music from now on.  And don't forget to go to truebluehealer.com.  20-minute beginner's tour.  Okay, ta-ta.  Thank you. ",
