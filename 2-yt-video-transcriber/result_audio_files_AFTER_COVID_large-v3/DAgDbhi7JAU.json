I am hopeful that if you're confirmed your tenure, we will see material advances on all three.  I will say it was disconcerting to see yesterday, the first day of the Biden administration, straight out of the gate, President Biden announced that he was canceling the Keystone pipeline.  That is a major infrastructure project.  That is a project that right now today has 1,200 good paying union jobs.  And in 2021, the Keystone pipeline was scheduled to have more than 11,000 jobs, including 8,000 union jobs, for contracts worth $1.6 billion.  And with the stroke of a pen, President Biden has told those 11,000 workers, those union workers, your jobs are gone.  Mr.  Buttigieg, what do you say to those workers whose jobs have just been eliminated by presidential edict? ",

And that... is altogether out of step with what the American people want.  There is also some rich irony in the long history of the Democratic Party.  There was a time when the Democratic Party, under presidents like FDR, was considered the party of union workers, of blue-collar workers.  And decisions like yesterday, and I fear more decisions that we will see in the days and weeks to come, are demonstrating more and more that today's Democratic Party is not concerned with working men and women having jobs, and that the answer is we'll eliminate your jobs, and I guess good luck in the future.

I've got to believe we can do both of those things, but if you and I can make common cause in our support for labor, then I think that's great news. ",

The major driver of that has been the shift from coal-fired electricity production to natural gas.  And the gas renaissance we're seeing in this country is producing enormous environmental benefits.  This past June, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration finalized a rule authorizing the bulk transportation of liquified natural gas by rail.  LNG by rail gives Americans, particularly those who are limited with energy choices because of geography, gives them an affordable option for electricity.  What are your views on the rule that was finalized allowing the transportation of LNG by rail? ",

I do recognize that natural gas, certainly for climate purposes, is not the same thing as coal.  In our own city, in our own municipal fleet, we did a lot of work on things from garbage trucks to light duty vehicles to have some of them run on gas.  And I think there was federal support to do that on our bus system as well.  It's not the same as coal, but of course it's also not the same as hydroelectric power.  And we need to be balancing all of these considerations as we go forward. ",

As you know, roughly three-fourths of DOT's budget is mandatory budget authority derived from the Highway Trust Fund.  Based on... 2020 apportionment, only three states in the country, Texas, Colorado, and South Carolina, remain donor states, meaning they contribute more than they receive back.  In the apportionment, the state of Texas contributed $212 million more to the Highway Trust Fund than the state's roads received.  Senator from your state, Senator Donnelly, had introduced legislation that would adjust that formula so that states would not be losers, would not be donor states.  Are you supportive of reassessing that formula? ",
