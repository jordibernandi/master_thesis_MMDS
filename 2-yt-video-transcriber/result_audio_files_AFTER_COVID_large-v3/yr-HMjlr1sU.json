Since this video's release, I've been hounded by comments telling me to take my video down, that I should have waited for the facts, I'm a race baiter, I look stupid, he broke the law, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

            "text": "So let's break down what we saw compared to the law.  Under Georgia law, a person commits the offense of criminal trespass when he or she knowingly and without authority enters upon the land or premise of another person for an unlawful purpose.  Each one of the elements have to be met.  Based on the video, what purpose did he walk into the house for and was the purpose unlawful?  According to the video and the owner of the house, he didn't take anything and he didn't force his way in.  He just walked around looking.  So is it possible he went to steal something?  Yes.  Is it possible he went in to find the magical door of Narnia?  Yeah, the same way.  it's possible that he went in simply because he was curious and wanted to look around an unconstructed home like millions of people do every single day.  Hell, when my house was being built, I literally walked in on a couple walking through my unconstructed home.  I was slightly taken aback, but I wasn't surprised because that's kind of what people do.  Alright, all suited up.  Steve and I are going to go for a nice walk and get some exercise.  The sun is out.  So yeah, we're going to go and see how many calories we can burn.  And we're going to go over and check out this new neighborhood.  They're building houses.  So we're going to kind of go in and out some of those and check and see what the floor plans look like and just have a nice walk.  This is a nice kitchen.  Yeah.  Nice and spacious.  I still like my kitchen.  I have more countertops in this kitchen.  The bar is nice.  Yes, there's also video of someone going into that house at night that some people think is Arbery.  But to my knowledge, that hasn't been confirmed.  However, nothing in those videos that we have shows that he went inside to steal something.  However, it does show he walked in, looked around, and then left.  Maybe he realized there was nothing to steal.  Either way, you can't infer intent based on weak, ambiguous, circumstantial evidence.  So based on the facts we have, we can't say he went in for an unlawful purpose.  More evidence may come out, but from what we have, it doesn't show him taking or stealing anything.  So the unlawful purpose element isn't met.  Now, how about, did he enter upon the land or premise of another person after receiving prior to such entry notice from the owner, rightful occupant or upon proper identification and authorized representative of the owner or rightful occupant that such entry is forbidden?  Long story short, did Arbery have noticed that he could not be on that property?  Much the same way.  a lot of concealed carry laws work.  If you carry a gun into establishment that has a no gun policy, you're not considered trespassing until they tell you to leave and you refuse to do so.  In the case of Rayburn v. State, the Georgia Supreme Court held that notice must be sufficiently explicit notice that apprises people of exactly what property they are forbidden to enter.  There was no one at the house.  From what we can see in the video and what was said, there were no doors on the house.  And as far as we know, there were no signs saying to keep out or no trespassing.  There were no gates or fences.  If any of these things existed at the time Aubrey went into the house, then yeah, he trespassed.  But that's why the operator asked, what did he do wrong?  And was he on the premise when he wasn't supposed to be?  I.e.  the notice element.  After he told her it was an open house under construction.  Glen Brunswick Communications, Operator Smith.  Hey, I live out in Stila Tours.  Okay.  There's a guy in a house right now.  Is that house under construction?  Okay, do you have your address or that house's address?  Right at 219 or 220 Stila Drive.  And you said someone's breaking into it right now?  No, it's all open.  It's under construction.  And he's running right now.  There he goes right now.  Okay, what is he doing?  He's running down the street.  Okay.  Okay, that's fine.  I'll get them out there.  I just need to know what he was doing wrong.  Was he just on the premises and not supposed to be?  Anybody here?  and stuff on it.  And he's been caught on the camera a bunch before at night.  Kind of an ongoing thing out here.  The man that's building the house has got heart issues.  I think he's not going to finish it.  Okay, that's fine.  And you said it was a male in a black t-shirt?  A white t-shirt.  Black guy, white t-shirt.  And he's done run back into the neighborhood.  So based on this information in the video, the notice element isn't met either.  Now, how about the last element?  Did Arbery remain upon the land or premise of another person after receiving notice from the owner, right occupant, or upon property identification and authorized representative for the owner or rightful occupant to depart?  In short, did anyone tell Arbery to leave the property, and if they did, did he leave?  In the video, you can see Arbery leaving the house when the neighbor showed up outside.  He might have been spooked by the neighbor.  The neighbor may have said something to him.  Either way, he left immediately, which means the last element isn't satisfied either.  So, based on the letter of the law and the videos and information we have, and not my feelings, Arbery did not trespass.  Now, if more information comes out showing that he took something, then yeah, he trespassed.  But as for right now, nah, he didn't because elements haven't been met.  So now what about burglary?  Did Arbery commit a burglary based on these videos? ",

            "text": "If the video doesn't show him trespassing based on the letter of the law, then you're hard pressed to say they show him engaging in a burglary under the letter of the law.  Because a burglary requires an intent to commit a felony, which is a higher standard than the unlawful purpose element of a trespass.  And based on the video, he was just walking around and looking.  You can't infer intent simply because he was walking into the house.  If he picked something up and put it in his pocket, got him.  If he had a bag and picked up something and put it in his bag, got him.  Otherwise, he just walked into a house that was under construction.  Based on the video, he didn't break anything.  He didn't deface anything.  He walked in, looked around, then walked out or ran out.  It really doesn't matter.  Now, does the video make him look suspect?  I can see someone making that argument, but if we're talking facts, there's nothing concrete in the video that we've seen so far.  There could be more considering.  the video was seven minutes long, but from what has been released, he technically broke no laws.  Now, let's talk citizen's arrest.  Under Georgia law, a private person may arrest an offender if the offense is committed in his presence or within his immediate knowledge.  If the offense is a felony and the offender is escaping or attempting to escape, a private person may arrest him upon reasonable and probable grounds of suspicion.  There are four elements in this law that must be satisfied to justify citizen's arrest.  First, a private person may arrest an offender if the offense is committed in his presence or within his immediate knowledge.  We have limited video of what Arbery was doing inside the house, but that's all we have.  So if based on these limited videos of what he did in the house and that wasn't shown him committing a felony, it stands to reason that no one on the outside of the house saw him commit a felony on the inside of the house, especially considering that the owner said nothing was taken.  If the cameras inside the house didn't show him committing a felony inside the house, then?  You can't say that an offense was committed in their presence or within immediate knowledge when we have video of what happened inside and still can't conclude an offense was committed.  Again, based on the information we have in the videos, the only thing that McNichols actually saw Aubrey doing was running down the street. ",

            "text": "The only knowledge he had of a crime was from past incidents, which ironically, based on the information we have, except for his reported stolen gun, weren't actually crimes because nothing was stolen from the house and was open with no notice that you were not allowed to be there.  That's the law.  As for the stolen gun, and this is just my opinion, I find it hard to believe that a person would steal a gun from a car in a neighborhood and then go back to the same neighborhood on foot.  That's just my opinion.  But outside of that, I have to ask, It's not.  The second element of citizen's arrest says a private person may arrest an offender if the offense is a felony.  Trespassing in Georgia is a misdemeanor.  Burglary is a felony.  As I stated before, nothing in the video shows that he committed a trespass or burglary, so the second element isn't met.  Keep in mind, you have to meet all of the elements, and we already can't meet two of the elements, so there's no point in even discussing the third one, but I will.  The third element, the offender is escaping or attempting to escape.  Let's say Arbery got spooked by the neighbor who saw him go inside the house and decided to run.  If he was committing a felony, then yes, this element would be met because he was leaving the house and the neighbor would be able to make a citizen's arrest.  because if Arbery actually committed a felony and the neighbor saw it or saw Arbery running out of the house with tools or materials, then he could make that citizen's arrest.  But as I showed you before, based on the information we have at this moment, there was no felony.  At this point, the fourth element is irrelevant, as we've yet to satisfy the first three.  Now on to self-defense.  Right now, based on the videos we have, we have yet to establish what law Arbery violated.  Under Georgia law, if you make a citizen's arrest and you're wrong about that person violating the law you think they violated, then you can be charged with false imprisonment.  Ironically, that was one of the first things I learned in law school.  Right now, based on all the facts we have before us, Not facts in the future, but right now.  What law did he break based on the letter of the law?  Not what you feel he broke, but what law he broke based on the letter of the law.  If you say none, then right now, based on what we have before us, you can't say with any certainty that McMichael was justified in blocking the road and trying to make a citizen's arrest of Arbery while holding a shotgun, at least not based on the information we have now.  That could change tomorrow or next week, but right now, you can't say that for a fact.  You can feel he was right, but based on the letter of the law, you can't say it's a fact. ",

            "text": "you can't say that for a fact.  You can feel he was right, but based on the letter of the law, you can't say it's a fact.  It's feeling.  There's no question that McMichael was the initial confronter, and it wasn't justified by law to confront Arbery.  Then by law, he's the initial aggressor.  So, whenever Arbery encountered him, He had every right to use lethal force to defend his life because McMichael was holding a gun in his hand while trying to block Arbery's path.  So I am saying based on the evidence at hand that is available to the public, there was enough evidence to charge the McMichaels with something.  And that's why the GDI charged them.  Yes, Aubrey had a criminal record, but having a criminal record doesn't automatically make Aubrey guilty of all crimes.  You still have to use facts to prove someone's guilty of a crime.  Otherwise, it's stereotyping based on feelings and preconceived notions.  You feel he committed a crime that day because he has a criminal record, and what he was doing looks suspect to you.  But the evidence and the Facts don't prove that in this case.  Maybe more facts will come out, maybe they won't, but based on what's out now, Arbery didn't commit a crime and thus had grounds to stand his ground when someone is trying to use their gun to stop him from doing what he had a legal right to do.  Sure, running at someone with a gun in their hand may be stupid, but in this case, Based on the facts we have, it's not illegal.  What is illegal is trying to imprison someone who hasn't committed a crime, especially when you haven't seen a crime being committed.  And based on the facts that we have, they did not see him commit a crime.  I can't prove or disprove Arbery's intentions that day, no more than I can prove or disprove the intentions of the McMichaels.  But, like I said in my original video... If you're literally watching me commit a crime, cool.  Do what you need to do within reason to stop the crime from happening.  But if you only suspect that I've committed a crime based on the way I look, call the cops and tell them where I am.  Because if you're wrong and you stop me with a gun in your hands, I'm gonna think you're trying to kill me.  And I'm gonna do everything in my power to stop you.  I never said or implied that the McMichaels were racist, never said they shot him because he was black.  I didn't even say they should be charged with murder.  Personally, I don't think it's the smartest thing in the world to walk through an unconstructed home in a foreign neighborhood, even though I, along with millions of other people, have done it countless times.  I also think a citizen blocking the road and standing with a shotgun in your hand to make a citizen's arrest simply because you see a man running on the street that fits a broad description of someone who committed a crime you didn't even see, screams, if you don't comply with me, I will shoot you.  Why else would he be holding the gun?  He didn't have a holster or slung across his shoulder but literally holding it.  Anyone confronted with this type of situation has a right to defend their life accordingly.  If Arbery didn't break any laws, he had every right to stand his ground that day.  If you disagree with me, I get it.  This isn't an open and shut case.  That's why we're talking about it.  That's why it's going to trial.  This is a controversial case with a lot of questions and clearly a lot of facts that haven't been released to the degree that I thought they were when I made my first video.  That being said, calling me a race baiter because you disagree with me on the facts is disingenuous.  Call me an homosexual, a car nut, a person with terrible taste in music, but a race baiter?  I'm absolutely not.  I didn't say Arbery should be alive today because he was black.  I'm saying he should be alive because I believe there was a better way to handle that entire situation.
