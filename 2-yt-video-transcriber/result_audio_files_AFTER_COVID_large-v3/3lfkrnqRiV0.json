These, in addition to the fact that the soft tissue is being isolated in what are basically concrete tombs, allowed for their preservation over tens of millions of years.

As for Armitage, his finding microscopic fragments of tissue inside bone that has escaped deterioration only suggests there was nothing in the bone to degrade it, not how long the bone had been resting in the ground undisturbed.  If you'll remember, Armitage is also the guy who claimed he got fired from the university where he worked for writing up a paper on the soft tissue, even though none of the other paleontologists who discovered soft tissue remains in other Mesozoic animals were fired for their findings.  Indeed, fossils of the hadrosaur Brachylophosaurus, the theropod Tarbosaurus, and some Mesozoic marine turtles also preserve some soft tissue.  None of this indicates that the Earth is young.

And I know it couldn't have been any higher than this.  And so that means the Earth is only about four hours old.  Well, what that misses is that the sun goes up and it goes down and then it goes up and then it goes down.  That's what's going on with the magnetic field as well. ",

While these scientific facts that we're talking about show the Earth can't be billions of years old, as modern science suggests, they aren't the ultimate authority.

This idea came from later interpreters of the Bible, most notably Bishop Usher, who took it upon themselves to add up the ages in the genealogy lineages provided in the Old Testament.  Even among those who accept the Christian scriptures as inerrant inspired works of God, this is considered a problematic approach for many reasons.  Among them, that in the ancient Near East genealogies, it was common to skip generations and be selective about who was included.  The description of one man as the son of another could describe a direct father-son relationship, but equally describe a great-great-great-great-grandson relationship.  More strikingly, the Hebrew word for day... Yom, used in Genesis, has different meanings even as used in Genesis, including the mere sunny portion of a day, a 24-hour period, or any indeterminate long age.  Like how in English we might say, in the day of the dinosaurs.  There are many devout Bible believers whom you should reference on this, including the special creation-affirming ministries of inspiring philosophy, religion, Well, Jackson and RJ, that wasn't too bad.
