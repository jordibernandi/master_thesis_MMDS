            "text": "The President.  So I think if we didn't do what we did, we would have had millions of people die.  We closed up our country.  We closed it up very, very quickly, very effectively.  did a job.  We learned about this horrible disease, along with the rest of the world, which had to learn about it.  And then we opened it up, and now we know the vulnerable.  We know who it attacks, who it's so vicious against.  And I think we've done, from every standpoint, a Incredible job.  We shouldn't have lost anybody.  Nobody should have lost.  China released something that they shouldn't have been allowed to release.  They should not have released.  It came out of China.  It went to Europe.  It went all over the world.  Should have never happened.  They could have stopped it.  They stopped it from going into the remainder of China.  It started in Wuhan.  And they stopped it.  But they didn't stop it from coming to our country.  Now, we had to show calm.  We had to show, you know, if it was up to you or whoever.  I have no idea what he said in the book.  And, again, it's a book that I gave him some quotes.  And, frankly, we'll see how the book turned out.  I have no idea.  You're asking me questions for the first time.  But, again, the last thing we can show is panic.  or excitement or fear or anything else.  We had to take care of the situation we were given.  Now, long before anybody else wanted to do it, I closed our borders to a very heavily infected China.  If I didn't do that, we would have had hundreds of thousands more people die.  Dr.  Fauci said it.  Many people said it.  It was a great decision.  It was a decision I made and I had to make.  It was a decision that a lot of people thought I was wrong.  Nancy Pelosi said I was wrong.  Joe Biden said I was wrong.  They all came back and they said it was the right decision.  And I was way early.  That was in January.  The end of January, I did that.  So that was a very good thing we did.  Otherwise, we would have had hundreds of thousands more.  If we didn't close the country, we would have been talking about millions of people instead of the numbers that we have right now. ",

We've opened up factories.  We've had tremendous success with face masks and with shields and with the ventilators.  We're now supplying the rest of the world.  We have all the ventilators we can use.  And remember this.  The ventilators were very important.  Not one person that needed a ventilator didn't get it.  And these are very complex, expensive machines to make.  We opened up something like hadn't been done since the Second World War.  We honestly, we've done an incredible job.  But we don't want to run around screaming, shouting, oh, look at this, look at this.  We have to show leadership.  And leadership is all about confidence.  And confidence is confidence in our country.  And our people have been great.  We've been put through a lot by China by releasing this.  By having this come here, we were put through a lot.  They could have done something about it, and they chose not to.  I am very honored to have presented to you today a list of 20 incredible people.  And we will talk later.  I'm sure we'll be meeting later in the day.  Thank you very much. ",
