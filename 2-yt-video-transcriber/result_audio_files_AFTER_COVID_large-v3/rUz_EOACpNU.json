My name is Anthony Brian Logan, and today I bring you a crazy video from Fox News featuring Martha McCallum, the anchor, attempting to conduct an interview with a Black Lives Matter so-called leader.  Now, the reason why I'm doing this video today is because you gotta see where I'm coming from and feel how I feel when I'm talking to crazy leftists on my call-in show and also occasionally in my everyday walking life.  And this video may encapsulate how you feel when I'm trying to talk to crazy lefties in your life, whether it be friend, family, coworker, or whatever.  Now, before I go any further, let's go ahead and roll it together.  I'll let it play and then I'll just jump in at certain points and give you my two cents.

I do not blame her for hanging up on the guy, for just letting them go.  Because at a certain point, it's like, all right, you're not answering the questions.  You're evading the questions.  Now you're trying to interview me.  It's like, well, I'm not a guest talking about anything you're talking about.  I'm not some person that you could just have on your show.  This is not the Hawk Newsome show, whatever his name is.  This is Fox News.  This is Martha McCallum's segment.  This is Martha McCallum's hour, whatever it is.  I run the show.  You don't.  Simple as that.  But this is what BLM does.  This is what Antifa do.  They will totally try to ignore your questions.  They try to talk around you.  And this is what some of the leftists in general do.  Some of the far leftists.  You got some regular normie leftists that aren't really into that.  That don't even really get politically active, really.  All they might do is simply say, okay, I like the left because I think they're good or they're better or they're better with money or something like that.  They got a real basic understanding of politics.  And that's probably the average American.  And maybe a little bit more.  if you're watching this video, you're a little bit right up and you understand.  But most people don't have the time to be able to be in the politics like that.  But this guy over here had a little bit of time to read enough to be able to deflect a conversation.  And Martha McCallum was not having it.  And shout out to her for not allowing that guy to just to do whatever he wants.  But you know what?  It pretty much illustrates what I was talking about about these guys.  They don't answer.  They evade.  They get belligerent.  They get loud.  That's just pretty much how they do.  But I think I'll leave that right there for now.  And what say you?  Were you surprised at the method in which this guy went about conducting an interview?  Well, you know, trying to be interviewed, but he ended up interviewing the interviewer.  If that's your viewpoint, let me know why in the comments below.  Do you think that most of the guys on the far left, people that you see in the streets, rising and looting and whatnot, think like him?  You got, I think, two kinds of people that are out there generally.  You might have a third kind, but that's a different story for a different video.  Two basic kinds out there.  You got the general moron who's just out there because they, you know, it's peer pressure or they're trying to steal something.  General moron.  Then you have guys like him that are kind of a moron, but at the same time a little bit red.  They're red enough to still be a moron in their action, but at the same time have enough of an ability to support their... Moronism with some things that might be compelling to another moron.  That's pretty much how it goes with guys like that.  And that's pretty much my stance.  And like I said, I want you to see this to understand what I go through all the time with these leftists.  You know, when I'm on my show or in the comment section, this is how they are.  This is no different than Twitter.  This is no different than, you know, the YouTube's live.  This is pretty much how they behave.  But whatever your thoughts are, please let me know in the comments below.  And that's all I got to say for this video.  If you like what you heard, please comment, rate, share, and subscribe. ",
