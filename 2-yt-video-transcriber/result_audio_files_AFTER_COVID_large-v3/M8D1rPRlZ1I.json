            "text": "Excuse me, you have a question?  Not really, I'm learning.  You're learning?  I'm Israeli.  You're Israeli?  Okay, very interesting.  So what tribe do you come from?  Yeah, are you a Yehudi?  yeah i'm saying nicodemus.  you said nicodemus.  what about nicodemus?  you're a what.  you're a naximan.  what's that?  so like you descend from nicodemus is what you're saying.  give me acts 13 and 1. you so do you?  are you uh uh an adherent to the jewish faith or you're just?  that's just your culture?  You're very into it.  You're very into it.  You're very into it.  Interesting, right?  So, are you familiar with the men, Noah's Ark, for example?  Noah had three sons.  Do you know who they are?  Noah had three sons named Shem, Ham, and Jacob.  Now, the Jewish nation, right, as they're called today, they come from which people?  Shem, right?  What people come from the lineage of Ham?  You don't know?  Okay, well, I'll tell you.  They say that the so-called black people come from the lineage of Ham, right?  So the reason why I bring that up is you're familiar with the Exodus story, right?  You are.  The Israelites went in Israel, 70 souls, right?  And they left Egypt in an innumerable multitude.  What color are the Egyptians?  They're black.  They're what?  They're black.  They're what?  Black.  I'm sorry.  Okay, they're black, right?  Are you kidding me?  They're black.  They're black.  Are you sure?  They be brown and black.  They're dark brown, right?  That's right.  Like this brother and this brother right here?  They be brown and black.  Brown and black.  Interesting.  So my question is... That's called genealogy.  Not fake.  Not fake.  That's a fact, right?  Not fiction, right?  So knowing that... how is it that if the jews came into egypt let's say the jews came into egypt?  your code just use your car as an example.  if they mix i'm just using it for argument's sake right not saying we're arguing but just for anybody that may be doing this and doesn't know what i'm talking about.  if they came in and mixed with so many so many black people for where they came out in innumerable multitude what color would that make the juice in?  they'd be black and dark.  they'd be black and dark.  so how are you putting me right now?  this is i should know this right so everybody should know this right.  it's coming up.  so that's the case.  it's simple fascist science when you go north with the white climate they've had to customize their dna.  They had to customize their DNA?  How do you customize your DNA?  Can I do that?  So I can grow like four more inches?  Can I customize it?  You would over 5,000 years, absolutely.  Really?  You get whiter too.  So how does one customize their DNA?  And when can we look at the history of the Jews customizing their DNA?  Like going north.  I'm saying, how did they do it?  And when did they do it?  Well, actually, first... you really track and it's actually not Jews it's the human race and there's like tons of scientific evidence about this.  there is the exodus that goes so you have different faces different colors for everything.  I know what you're saying.  People move north and they get the... I know what you're saying.  I would disagree with that science, but there's a couple things you said I do agree with.  You said that the Jews were black people.  So who are those people in the land of Israel right now?  They're not black.  Those white Jews, they can't be real people.  According to what you just said, the Jews are black.  You said it.  Are you kidding me right now?  Wait, you said it.  What's your name?  I just went to science.  And all the Jewish people that went to Northern Europe and elsewhere eventually, over a span of thousands of years, lightened their skin.  Get Acts 13 and 1.  Let's see what the Bible says, because this is thousands of years after the Exodus.  And let's see what the Jews looked like even thousands of years after the Exodus.  This is the book of Acts, chapter 13, verse 1. ",

Let's see what the Bible says, what the description of the Israelites were.  That was called nigger.  That was called what?  Nigger.  That was called what?  Nigger.  They were called nigger.  The Israelites were called nigger.  What people on the earth, we're reading out the Bible.  Yes, that's in the Bible.  That's in the Bible.  That's in the Holy Bible.  Acts the 13th chapter.  in the first verse, the Jews were called niggers.  What people in the world are called niggers today?  Seriously?  Nobody can be called nigger today.  Of course, but I mean... And if they want to do that within their own places and whatever they want to do, they are black Americans.  Black Americans.  So if black Americans are called nigger and the Jews are called nigger... And if they want to be anywhere else in the world, then they need to make a stake on their own.
