I'd like to talk today about the Strategic Air Campaign and the status of the Afghanistan and Coalition Air Force.  Over the past weekend, United States forces conducted air operations to strike Taliban and East Turkestan Islamic Movement, or ETIM, training facilities in Badakhshan province.  The destruction of these training facilities prevent terrorists from planning any acts near the border with China and Tajikistan.  One brief note on ETIM, which I just mentioned.  They are a terrorist organization that operates in China and the border regions of Afghanistan.  ETIM enjoys support from the Taliban in the mountains of Badakhshan.  So hitting these Taliban training facilities and squeezing the Taliban support networks degrades ETIM capabilities.  What I'd like to do is show you a couple videos of strikes in this area in Badakhshan.  The first one that you're going to see is a B-52 strike on a Taliban training camp in Badakhshan.  Adrian, can you please roll the tape?  This strike occurred on 4 February. ",

            "text": "I'm walking on a street in Xinjiang, and this is like the bike lane and the pedestrian lane, so it's really nice.  Like most Chinese cities, they have these separate lanes.  And what I love about Chinese streets is that they're all tree lines, so you get the shade, and you never have to really worry about getting your skin burnt to a crisp.  Because most streets in China are like this.  Sounds weird, but it's like one of my favorite things about China.  Just like if you're walking around in Toronto, you're just going to get fried by the sun.  They don't have anything like this.  You're just on the sidewalk.  It's just a concrete jungle for most of the city.  Especially when you're walking on the major streets.  Like this is a major street.  You see that?  Like this is like heavy traffic.  This is a major freaking street, you know?  And they have this.  So, in Toronto, maybe you'll have some neighborhoods.  Like, if you go to a small residential area, yeah, there's a lot of trees there, of course.  But not in the major roads.  Like, Yonge Street, York Mills, it's just pure concrete.  You remember Chi?  Looks pretty much like any other Chinese city, except that there are a lot more police, that's for sure.  There is a higher police presence because there has been terrorism in the past, just in the last 10 years.  It killed a lot of people.  And then there's also like some separatist movement as well.  Both of them are violent.  So one thing you're going to notice in Xinjiang, or Yulumuchi at least, is that there's going to be Chinese flags everywhere.  And that's just part of the mission to create harmony and make sure people realize, look, we're in China, this is one country, let's stick together.  You don't see this in other provinces.  So today I'm walking from one side of the city to the other.  It's about 10 kilometers.  It's going to take me two hours.  But it's really great to see a lot of the city.  I mean, there's no better way than just walking, right?  So yeah, it's pretty cool that you can see a lot of the kids.  You can see a lot of the kids are back to school.  And that's pretty nice because other places are not back to school.  And every block has, like, a police station.  And there are kind of, like, checkpoints, kind of.  There are, I don't know, on certain intersections.  there is, like, a police car and a couple... But none of them are armed, by the way.  In China, it's very rare to see a policeman armed.  And by that, I mean with a gun.  They just have a shield and a stick.  So in the past, there were knife attacks.  There were knife, you know, terrorism attacks.  And so I guess for a knife attack, all you really need is a shield and a stick to block the knife and to poke them away.  And earlier that, they were training people, shopkeepers, how to put on a safety thing, and then use the baton to push people away.  So it's still quite lovely.  The roads are nice.  Traffic lights.  Lots of people drive cars.  As always, the buses are nice.  Public transportation.  And like I said before, everywhere you look, there's a Chinese flag everywhere.  Again, it's part of the campaign, part of the education system.  Some of the Uyghurs or the minorities had to go to re-education centers or vocational centers to learn Chinese, learn skills.  They didn't want a bunch of people idling about, which is easy for extremism to develop.  Look at this cute dog.  Oh my gosh, this dog is so cute.  Such a cute dog.  Xinzhen dog.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Oh my god, this dog is so cute.  What a cute dog.  What a cute dog.  I'm trying to get a picture of him.  Yeah, anyways, I'm just going to walk right through the city.  It's going to take two hours, and I'm going to interview as many people as I can.  Like, whoever wants to talk to me, I'll just interview them. ",
