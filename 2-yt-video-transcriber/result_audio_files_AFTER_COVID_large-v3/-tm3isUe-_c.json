            "text": "On Twitter, shouldn't the president be fact-checked?  Especially this president who has made so many false and misleading statements that has put, you know, fact-checkers to work across the world.  I mean, he's uttered some 18,000 false and misleading statements, according to the Washington Post.  If there's any president out there who should be fact-checked, any political leader out there should be fact-checked, isn't it President Trump?  And aren't you trying to silence fact-checking by going after Twitter like this? ",

To give you a list of some of the most egregious ones, that ABC News in December of 2017 falsely reported that Flynn would testify that the president directed him during the campaign to make contact with the Russians.  That was false.  In 2017, your network CNN botched their Wikileaks email exclusive and were forced to make on-air corrections.  CNN's Jim Sciutto, another CNN one, dropped a fictional bombshell in 2018, July, claiming that Michael Cohen would tell federal investigators that the president knew of the Trump Tower meeting.  And there are many more, not to just put the onus on CNN there.  So if anyone needs to be fact-checked, I think it should be the media. ",

We've shipped around the world.  Washington Post, U.S.  health system is showing why it's not ready for a coronavirus pandemic.  We were ready.  There's many more I could get to.  I could, on the coronavirus specifically, I could spend the time going through these, but I don't think that's what the American people want to hear. ",
