            "text": "Thank you for tuning in to Swoos Films Entertainment.  I saw this video on Twitter about this young lady speaking on the Dwyane Wade situation with his son.  And I thought she spoke a lot of truth.  She's not politically correct.  She just tells it like it is.  And I think people need to stop being so politically correct and talk about this for what it is.  Check out this video.  Leave a comment.  Rate and subscribe.  Oh, these motherfuckers is tripping.  Now, I see everybody talking about this, but I don't see nobody saying what really needs to be fucking said.  So listen up.  Now, first things first.  This is a 12-year-old boy.  12.  He probably doesn't even order his food when they go out to eat.  He probably changes what he wants to be when he gets older every five seconds.  He might not even be into girls yet.  if that's what he gonna be into.  my point is he is not old enough or mature enough to decide whether he wants to switch genders or not.  that is a life-changing decision.  he hasn't even experienced manhood yet and you tell me he's ready to be a woman if my son would have woke up to me and say that shit i'm not taking no bullshit ass excuse like i want to live my truth.  no little nigga.  you need to live your life as a boy because that's what the fuck you are.  Now.  that's my initial response.  But after that, I'm going to tell him you need to go to counseling.  Because obviously you think something is wrong if you don't want to be a boy anymore.  Now I know this may upset some of you.  You might think it's homophobic, transphobic, gender, whatever the fuck, phobic.  But the truth hurts sometimes, my nigga.  And this shit needs to be said.  I cannot sit back no longer and allow y'all to enable this bullshit.  If someone is sick, you give them medicine.  If someone is an alcoholic, you take them to treatment.  If someone is on drugs, you take the drugs away.  But if somebody is born with gender dysphoria or think they were born in the wrong gender, you enable them to continue to think that?  Or wouldn't it make sense to get them help?  And I get it.  Dwayne Wayne was trying to do what most parents want to do, which is the best thing for their child.  You want to support them, be nonjudgmental, be there for them.  I get it.  But this is not support.  This is enabling.  This is supporting mental illness.  I bet you if he got up and said, I want to be a dog.  He would not be on Ellen talking about some goddamn supportive parenting.  He would have been like, nigga, you ain't no goddamn dog.  Let's go.  What you talking about? ",
