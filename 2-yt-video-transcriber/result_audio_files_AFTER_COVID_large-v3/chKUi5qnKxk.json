            "text": "guys you never guessed that in those silos right there is the entrance to a nuclear bomb shelter.  and what's even cooler is out in that field under the floor of one of those vehicles is the escape hatch coming out of that bomb shelter.  so guys sit down and enjoy this video.  this is one of the coolest ones i've ever done.  there's the escape hatch through the bottom of the floor.  So we're going to go in this little silo here and they got the shelter hidden inside here buried in the concrete inside this grain silo.  So this is going to look like a great silo for a bombshell.  Is this two feet of cement in here?  Okay.  Well, you can go all the way up to about right here.  So you didn't go as high as you wanted to.  It's up to our needs.  Really?  That's how deep it was.  Wow.  That's a lot of concrete.  That's cool.  And I like the air pipes inside.  And those are galvanized, of course.  That's steel, and it has a protective mat underneath it.  So there's a, can't get a hose in there.  And of course there's a check valve below that.  So even if somebody poured fuel in there, it would go straight to the ground.  It can't, nothing can get into the bumper.  Ooh, that's a long way to go out there.  He turned on the light.  All right.  So I'm going to go down 20 feet on the ground.  Ooh, that's cold.  I can feel the cold air.  This is the mud room.  And this is that gas-tight door.  Wow, look how fancy that bunker is in there.  This is an exotic-looking bunker, isn't it?  Wow, it looks like it has a woman's touch.  Did you decorate it, ma'am?  A little bit.  Wow, look at this.  I'll tell you, when you get all these rugs in here, it feels really cozy, doesn't it?  Yeah, wow.  Look at these beds and I feel like we're in an African safari.  I feel like it's a zebra.  Well, y'all spent some time decorating here.  So you got your little computer with cameras there?  So I got a guy that can do the cameras for you, and you can basically look at your bunker at any time from the phone.  I just came from one.  You like that reclining couch?  Yeah.  Yeah, I like the couch.  I got the same one.  I put it in all the bunkers.  So you got a TV there and you got the storage under there.  You got your food under the floor?  Oh, we got a little bit of everything under there.  Wow, I like this with these magnets.  Okay, those work really good.  God, they're strong, aren't they?  Oh, you got a captain's bed in here?  Oh yeah, you do.  Look at that.  So you got your drawers in here.  Yeah, look at that, extra sheets and stuff.  Big old master bedroom.  And then his escape tunnel has got a flashlight in there.  I mean, I've got a light in there.  That's what I'm doing right now.  I'm in one of my bunkers watching myself on YouTube right now.  This is cool, isn't it?  Ah.  Always ask me, what is the temperature in a bunker?  And in the United States, the average temperature in a root cellar is between 56 and 58 degrees.  So when we came in here, it was 57 degrees.  It's 58 degrees now because the human bodies are in here.  I've already brought it up about one degree, but for the most part, that will be your temperature in your bunker.  I like the clock with the temperature in here and the date.  Where did you get that?  That's from AcuRite.  That's a nice little clock right there.  Every bunker should have one in them right there.  We wanted to make sure we knew what day it was.  Well, the temperature too.  Yeah.  Yeah, so it's staying at 58 degrees down here.  You know what?  It's not too cold either.  I mean, it's cool.  You can tell it's cool.  You could wear a sweater, but it feels pretty good, especially on a summer day.  It'd be nice down here, wouldn't it?  So what did you come up with?  it's induction heating.  oh yeah of course that's what i use.  same one from the same company new wave.  yeah it only gets hot when you uh put the metal plate.  so when you survive in a bunker all you got to do is heat water.  but you're apparently cooking gourmet meals down here.  but yeah i have the same exact oven in here induction heating and then you can always heat your water in the microwave or you can get one of those coffee pot looking things that just.  uh oh you have one of those here.  okay yeah right there yeah and that's all you got to do to survive.  just heat the water put it on the uh emergency essentials or the mountain house food and that's it.  and that's life in a bunker.  so you got all your storage under the floor.  you got storage under the benches here.  let's see if you put anything in there.  okay you got some towels in there or blankets.  Got all your emergency essentials food in there that they sent you.  And does your radio work?  Yep.  So it's a VHF-HF combination, or is it?  Yep.  Okay, so you can talk to anybody around the world with that right there.  And so it's got six beds in here.  Of course, there's storage under each bed.  Oh, look at that.  It's got all the towels in there.  I like this bathroom.  And of course, the overpressure valve is right here.  So when you turn on the air system and you're going to the bathroom, this will let the smell out.  If somebody tried to pump gas in and there was a blast from the outside, this would shut like that.  So when people think that you could just pump gas in here, you can't do it because the pressure would close the valve and it wouldn't get any kind of carbon monoxide in here.  What do we got in the fridge there?  So, okay, they keep some soft drinks and some water in there.  And it's cold in there.  So y'all leave it on the whole time you're down here.  Where are the batteries at?  In the shack.  Oh, in the shack.  Okay.  And they got a microwave.  So typical bunker how it should be.  And you got your trash can and got your emergency essentials.  Do you have plenty of food?  Do you?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  So going up.  Oh, it's hot up here.  It's hot in here, but it's cold down there.  I can see why the temperature change went up one degree because of the heat.  So inside the silo here, the hatch is inside here and the air pipe's in here too.  So there's really nothing on the outside except one pipe and it's so hidden I can't even see it.  But all you gotta do is push this down.  That's it.  Okay, on this bunker, I'm not gonna show up from the outside, but the escape hatch is actually coming up into a banded van.  So if they have to escape their bunker, they come up through this, they come into the van, and they can do what they gotta do from here.  Well, I hope you guys enjoyed that video.  I don't want to show you exactly where the skate patch is coming out, but let's just say it's in one of these abandoned cars out in this field right here.  So guys, make sure you like and subscribe.  And guys, I will see you on the next video.  And thanks for watching. ",
