            "text": "Hello Scaredy Cats, it's me, Scaredy Matt.  And I just watched The Rage.  We're all going to die.  Those things are demons from hell.  The devil must want our souls.  Stop it, Olivia!  Come on, you fucker!  Uncle Ben, why'd daddy have to die?  Your daddy loved you a lot.  He still does.  He's just up in heaven now.  I'm gonna shove that monkey up your ass!  No!  No!  No!  Kinda dumbstruck on this one, everybody.  This movie was one hell of a mixed bag.  I've never had an experience quite like this.  The whole time I was watching this movie, I genuinely couldn't tell if I was enjoying it or not.  The Rage, sorry, sorry, Robert Kurtzman's The Rage reunites Kurtzman and Andrew Devoff, the director and star of Wishmaster, respectively.  I knew I was going to throw in a bonus movie at the end of this Wishmaster series, but full disclosure, I'd always planned on it being Faust, Love of the Damned.  I had this whole thing I was going to do when I reviewed Wishmaster 3, where I was going to talk about how the college the film takes place in is doing a production of Dr.  Faustus and how synchronistic that was.  Now I've seen Faust, Love of the Damned.  I've sought it out because it had Andrew Devoff and Jeffrey Combs.  After seeing the trailer before my all-time favorite So Bad It's Good movie, Rottweiler.  What's the matter?  You can't keep up?  For some reason, though, I had it in my head that Robert Kurtzman directed Faust, Love of the Damned, but he didn't.  Brian Yuzna did.  Brian Yuzna, the co-creator of the Reanimator films, director of Society, and most prestigiously, the director of Rottweiler.  Rottweiler's about a robot dog that kills people, in case you were curious.  Real fun.  Good time to watch that.  But the fact that it just stars Devoff isn't exactly a strong enough connection to make it the bonus video to Cap off the Wishmaster series.  The Rage, though.  Not only does it have Devov, it was directed by Kurtzman, and Reggie Bannister even makes a cameo, just like he did in the first Wishmaster.  This is practically a Wishmaster movie.  Thing is... I knew Faust's Love of the Damned was bonkers, and I was excited to share it with you all.  What if the rage was boring?  What if there's nothing to talk about?  Good news, it's not boring.  It's a lot of things, but it's certainly not boring.  It's the perfect movie for this kind of video, because the movie itself is kind of not fun to watch, but very fun to talk about.  By watching this video, you're getting the best version of this movie.  On the other hand, it's also a movie about a super contagious virus that is super deadly.  So maybe that's not going to be a great thing to watch right now.  The rage is really unpleasant at some times.  There's a lot of really fucked up stuff that doesn't sit well within the Campy B movie vibe.  it has going for it.  You'll see what I mean as we get going.  So we open on Dr.  Devoff doing some mad science to a couple of randos.  He transforms one of them into a rage zombie using a virus called rage.  Already, you should be noticing a theme in this movie.  Instead of gently playing homage to its influences, it straight up plagiarizes them.  Everything from 28 Days Later To Reanimator.  To Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  The rage just straight up lifts elements from them wholesale.  Anywho, Devov's character, whose name is something Russian, look, I gotta be honest, I don't remember the name of anybody in this movie.  I'm just gonna give them my own names.  The main girl is called Kat.  I know that, so I remember that one.  But everyone else is getting a made-up name because I don't care and neither should you.  So Dr.  Bad Science, who is later established as being the greatest living genius in the field of biological engineering, forgot to tie up the test subject securely.  The test subject he was attempting to inject with a virus that made him uncontrollably angry.  One of the world's smartest men didn't think to double-check that knot.  The results are predictable.  Guy gets up, Dr.  Bad Science and the guy have a long, pointless fight.  The guy bites him, but Dr.  Bad Science injects himself with the antidote, but gets double killed.  So... He's dead.  Hope you enjoyed Andrew Devoff's role in this movie.  That's all the Devoff you get.  I've been sitting through two fucking Wishmaster movies trying to get a little taste of that sweet, delicious Devoff.  This is how you do me?  The rage?  So we cut to Warped Tour.  Some band you've never heard of called Mushroomhead is playing a concert, and there are a lot of people making out.  Cat is dancing with Scummo and Scumette, while Cat Friend Female is having a discussion with Cat Friend Male.  Cat Friend Female does not want to let Cat have sex with Scummo and Scumette because they gave her a bunch of ecstasy.  That sounds pretty reasonable to me, actually.  But Cat Friend Male convinces her that Cat can make her own choices.  And that's true.  People should be free to do whatever they want with enthusiastically consenting adults.  But do you know when someone probably shouldn't be trusted to make their own choices, though?  When they've been drugged.  So they have drugged sex, and Cat immediately regrets it, and then the movie tries to pretend like this isn't something incredibly fucked up.  Like, this plot line serves no purpose.  It sets up a love triangle between Cat, Scummo, and Scumette that the movie will very quickly abandon.  Then some roadies hit on Cat with the most disgusting line I think I've ever heard in a movie.  Damn, I wanna lick you in places you haven't washed yet!  Why?  Why would you say that?  Look, I've never catcalled anybody, so I don't know how to do it, but I don't think what he's saying here is correct.  I don't know why this is in the movie because it's completely pointless and also so very fucking gross.  I assume this guy is a cameo of some kind.  If so, probably should have thought that through better.  Meanwhile, the guy who killed Andrew Devoff and therefore ruined the movie comes across a couple fucking in a convertible.  If you ever have to film a sex scene, don't do it like this.  We get a lot of dialogue from them establishing her backstory about how she used to be with someone else, but she left that guy to be with this guy.  And it seems like this is gonna be important, right?  This is exposition that's gonna come into play later.  And then the lumpy zombie kills them both and he rips out the lady's eyes and eats them before killing her, which feels a little much.  This movie is real extra, but the effects are great.  The practical effects, the gore, it all looks good.  The CGI effects are another story.  Lumpy zombie wanders into the woods and dies for some reason.  Then some CGI vultures gobble up his dang body.  You see where this is going?  Meanwhile, Reggie Bannister from the film Phantasm is fishing with two kids.  Again, we get a lot of exposition that seems to imply a backstory that will be relevant later about how the kids' parents died mysteriously and their uncle, Reggie Bannister, had to adopt them.  So the kids are sick of being in the movie, so one of them wanders into the woods to piss and gets eaten violently by zombie vultures.  Hey, the rage?  You didn't earn that.  That's real dark.  You can't show a mutilated child corpse in the middle of your cheapo zombie movie.  Why the hell did anyone think this was a good idea?  And then Reggie and the boy have this exchange.  Uncle Ben, I'm bored.  Really?  Well, we just got here.  I want to go home and play the new Xbox you bought us.  Well, we're only going to be here in another hour or so.  What's your favorite game?  Star Wars.  Star Wars.  How about that other game I got you?  Phantasm?  I like that too, but Mom took it away because it was too scary.  Too scary.  She did, huh?  I get it, Reggie Bannister is from Phantasm, but that is such a lame way to sneak that joke in.  Here's how you do a Phantasm reference.  Kid says, I want to go home and play Xbox.  Reggie says, ah, you spend too much time on that thing.  Kid says, you're just mad because I always beat you.  And then Reggie would turn to the kid and say, You play a good game, boy!  That's off the dome?  It's so fucking simple.  Think next time.  There is no Phantasm game for Xbox.  I would know if there was a Phantasm game for Xbox.  How dare you?  Anyway, Reggie goes off to look for the kid, abandoning the other kid, and gets sprayed with vulture acid, which I thought was just a convenient thing that the movie made up, like I thought that was part of the lore of the zombie virus.  But apparently it's a thing vultures really do when threatened.  So that's a neat little bit of trivia that you learned from this video.  This turns Reggie into a lumpy zombie and gives him the ability to teleport, I think.  And he kills the other kid.  So why the fuck we needed the tragic backstory, I have no idea.  Back to the Scooby gang.  Cat and Scumette are fighting because Scumette won't stop trying to fuck Scummo.  And who could blame her?  Who could resist this guy?  In all the kerfuffle, they end up driving over Reggie Bannister.  So they go out to check and everyone has some wild reactions to the whole situation.  Then Reggie pops out and tries to bite a guy and then he gets pulled back under the car by something.  So silly me, here I was thinking.  The vultures were just going to spread the zombie disease to the other humans and that's how the story would get started.  But no.  The vultures are the primary antagonists for most of the movie.  Most of the time they're horrible CG, but sometimes, sometimes they're adorable puppets that I love so much.  and I want one of these puppets so bad.  And if you know anyone who's involved in the prop department for the movie, The Rage, please, please tell them to make me an offer.  So they trap everyone in the RV and somehow the vultures also throw Reggie Bannister's head through a window.  And I just, I wish I could see.  One of the vulture puppets do that.  That would be so fucking choice.  So the Scooby gang starts a gas leak and blow up some of the vultures, but the vultures get cat friend mail.  So they all wander off into the cheapest woodsy set they can find, and Scumette immediately goes crazy.  Like, instantly.  Full-blown movie crazy in the run of an hour.  Coming for us, Pris.  Can't you hear them drawing closer and closer?  Shut up!  Stop it!  She sees a human skull and she's like, I've got a secret.  And she starts talking about how God wants them dead and all that type of shit.  This is an hour in.  Well, if I know this movie, if they spend that time setting this up, they're going to pay it off with a big reveal.  Oh, no, no.  She just falls into a pond that's inexplicably full of giant leeches and dies because vultures attack.  And the vultures are mad, you see, because Skummo smashed their eggs up.  That made the vultures want to attack them.  So, okay.  Vultures infected with the virus still care about their offspring, but humans are willing to eat theirs upon being infected.  Okay, sure, whatever, very consistent.  Anyway, they run around the woods aimlessly and find Dr.  Bad Science's cabin, where they're apprehended by lumpy zombies.  And they're confronted by Dr.  Bad Science!  He's back, he's lumpy!  That's right, there's more devoff.  I lied to you.  I wanted you to suffer the same disappointment I did when I thought he was out of the movie, so that you could share my elation at realizing there was more Dank Divof to come.  And characteristically, he'd choose this movie the fuck up.  Do you want me to beat you, Kui?  You must remain very, very quiet.  Or there will be no beating for you tonight.  I died and was resurrected as this pathetic thing which you see standing before you.  The living embodiment of my mistakes.  I'm Dr.  Victor Vasilenko.  And who are you?  So he straps Cat and Cat Friend Female to gurneys and traps Scummo inside a cage and starts experimenting on Cat Friend Female, drilling holes in her brain and shit.  He's accompanied by two lumpy zombies and He's got this little mutant named Misfit who talks in the most annoying voice.  Misfit is just fucking terrible.  I didn't even mention it earlier, but the first thing Dr.  Bad Science does when he captures Cat is grab her breast, and then Misfit gets really sexually aggressive and just.  Why is this in the movie?  You don't have to put it in the movie.  Nobody made.  you put it in the movie.  Thematically, it doesn't add anything, and it doesn't make the movie more tense or scary or funny.  It's just nasty.  Nasty for no reason.  And the way that the movie uses this character to conflate cross-dressing and sexual perversion is deeply uncomfortable.  Fuck this.  So how come Dr.  Bad Science is up to all these wacky tricks anyway?  Turns out he was a brilliant scientist in the Soviet Union who, like a future Joe Biden, discovered a cure for cancer.  But when the USSR fell, his funding got cut and his cure got buried so that big pharmaceutical companies could keep profiting from the treatment of cancer in a way that they wouldn't be able to profit.  from a cure for cancer anyway.  he tried to speak up about it and he got put in an insane asylum because of it.  so he vowed to get revenge on capitalism and create a super plague that only he could cure.  but he'd only release the cure if his cancer cure was released.  so that's Okay, that's a lot of things.  Now, is it wrong to shackle the advancement of medical sciences to what is deemed profitable?  I mean, Goldman Sachs isn't sure that curing people of illnesses is a sustainable business model.  Do the ends justify the means?  Is it permissible to commit such an atrocity if it could potentially save more people in the long run?  How different is Andrew Devoff's scheme from withholding medical care for profit, really?  That's a whole lot of things that could be explored in this movie, but they're not.  Not in this one.  This one says, nah.  Nah, we're not going to talk about those.  No thanks.  So anyway, Dr.  Bad Science's super virus escaped because he didn't expect vultures to get it.  And now he has to cook up a new cure.  Because the old cure didn't, it doesn't work on vultures, I guess.  Or else the world is going to get fucked up by the virus.  And I feel like he explains this many times to the protagonists.  Now, I'm not saying that they should volunteer to be his guinea pigs, but watching this in the middle of a real pandemic that's going to kill thousands, maybe millions of people, I can't help but root for the evil doctor on this one.  I would definitely trade any of the characters in this movie for a cure.  But then these two numbnuts escape and defeat Gore the Undying, the giant super zombie in the basement.  that doesn't make any sense, but it rules, so I'm not complaining.  And then they finally kill Dr.  Bad Science.  I have become a god.  Nothing can stop me!  Wrong, asshole!  And run off into the sunset, except, oops, the vultures are still out and the world is still doomed, which they should have known.  I don't really understand why.  They thought they had escaped this situation, but fine.  So you can kind of see how this movie is a mixed bag.  On the one hand, it's got all these fun, campy bits, the really weird, cool effects, a fun performance from Divoff.  But on the other hand, the script is a mess.  The story is contrived, and it takes weird forays into territory that is either more heavy-handed than they were willing to explore, or way too dark to fit the movie's tone.  I'm by no means prudish when it comes to extreme content in movies, but I do think that thoughtlessly throwing in sexual assault or child dismemberment can throw off a movie's rhythm, you know?  Like, if that happened in the middle of, like, the Lego movie, you'd probably be like, oh, this is, oh, no.  This movie feels like it was made by adults based on a screenplay by teenagers.  The weird understanding of human sexuality, the wild shifts in tone, the way that every character is introduced by re-explaining their life story to the other characters on screen, except for the characters we're meant to care about.  Robert Kurtzman is known for doing effects more so than directing, and that's really on display in The Rage.  It is first and foremost an excuse to do lots of gross-out practical effects, and everything else was an afterthought.  But at this budget, it's not like you're going to have a lot of effects anyway, so most of the movie ends up being an afterthought.  Anyway, I hope this movie about a highly contagious and deadly virus distracted you from your troubles for a little while.  What a great time to talk about The Rage from 2007.  Next time, we're finally going to move on to something that isn't Wishmaster related, probably.  The curse has been lifted, and hopefully some good movies come out in theaters for me to talk about.  Just kidding.  The world ended.  There's no movies ever again.  We have to make do with the movies we already have.  Thanks for watching this video from youtube.com slash scaredycatstv.
