Yes, guys, the beautiful country of Belarus, Russia's brother, one of the biggest and most important post-Soviet states.  A country located in Eastern Europe, Belarus, does not think that the coronavirus exists.  And in particular, the Belorussian president, Alexander Lukashenko, also known as Batka, doesn't think that the coronavirus is real, he thinks it's a hoax, and there are zero measures taken in the country to prevent it.

The plandemic has been designed to rapidly transform the western democracies into highly authoritarian or totalitarian systems while eliminating the middle class, small businesses and using counterfeit currency aka money printing to buy up your assets while devaluing the savings and purchasing power of ordinary citizens.  It is one giant wealth and power transfer from the average Joe to the 1% globalists who run this world and want to bring in their Luciferian one world government system to make the average Joe a dead slave dependent on them.  Why are they paying you free money from the government?  They're trying to get people used to free money because by September this year, they're going to cut it.  It is a cover for food shortages, for race wars, Black Lives Matter and all that other nonsense, for 5G radiation.  It is a cover for forced vaccinations that will sterilize and RFID cheap people, cashless society and so on.  If you're too blind to realize what is going on with the world right now, then you deserve what's coming.  These globalists have been planning for these events for over 100 years.

Oh, but wait, you and the granny over there not even wearing a mask and not keeping six feet apart.
