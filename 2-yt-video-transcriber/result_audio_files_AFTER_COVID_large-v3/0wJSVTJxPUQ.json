Listen, ma'am, I want you to look at something.  Don't you tell me what's wrong with this world.  I'm out here defending we the people.  Okay, we have God-given rights.  You want to give up yours?  Go sit in your house, wait for the apocalypse.  These are our rights.  This is our flag.  This is our constitution.  If you think the constitution is what is wrong with the world, then get on a spaceship and go to a different one.  End of discussion.  It is.  Because I... Listen, do you believe, ma'am, do you believe in equal rights?  No, you're being disorderly.  De-escalate.  Do you know that there are victims here besides the police?  if you want to be disorderly?  That's disorderly conduct.  It's punishable by up to one year in the Indiana House of Corrections.  That's your free speech.  I would decline that offer, but thank you anyways.  I believe the police are making contact, guys.  Yeah, they are.  Trying to keep my phone hidden.  All right, guys.  Manderson police have just arrived.  Now, he's staying behind public utilities.  He's in a public place.  We're going to keep an eye until they get out of the car.  Now they're going to the bank to talk to the complaining parties.  They haven't fucked with him yet.  Taking his picture.  Not good.  We're going to get over there right now.  I have no reason to be taking this picture.  He's on public property.  This is a sidewalk.  I can only get across the street.  Public sidewalk.  His utility is right here.  What's your name and badge number, bud?  What's your name and badge number?  Here you go, man.  Not so hard.  Thanks, man.  We had an incident and we just want to show people how good cops react versus how bad cops react.  You know, he did the same thing in West Lafayette.  They pulled the gun on him and arrested him.  Is he doing anything wrong right now?  Awesome.  Excellent.  You go West Lafayette.  This is how you do your job.  He's on a public easement.  So West Lafayette, this is what happens.  Now, the same response happened.  A public place called, right?  They said, we got a guy in a ski mask.  Now, the West Lafayette cop came up to him and started asking questions.  He said, I mean, no ill will.  I'm on a public easement.  Leave me alone.  They handcuffed him.  They drew a gun on him.  They beat him.  That video is viral.  Now, we had the same incident.  But these cops are using their recorder for police purposes.  They're telling him he's on a public sidewalk.  He hasn't done anything wrong.  And they are literally only responding because somebody of the community called and asked for assistance.  So there's two ways that this thing could go down.  Now, people might not like he's in a ski mask.  People might not like he's filming.  But there's nothing illegal about it.  Sir, I don't want to get into an argument with her.  So if she just minds her business.  Absolutely.  I agree.  You're 100% right.  Well, I don't think color was ever brought into this, ma'am.  It has nothing to do... We just want people to know that filming from a public place is absolutely fine.  And you're free to... Well, we did a fire department yesterday.  These officers know I go everywhere and do this.  That's what we should do.  It takes a village, right?  You should.  And you did the right thing.  You called the police to make sure that everything was okay.  They're letting you know everything's fine.  Because they're our rights.  If we don't use them, we lose them.  Really?  Because listen, ma'am, in West Lafayette yesterday, the police responded to the exact same call.  And here's what we're showing.  What they did is they pulled the gun on him.  They threw him to the ground.  They beat him.  The video is viral.  The officer is already under investigation.  That was a day ago.  And now these are how your officers are responding.  So if anything, we're showing how your police are doing the right thing in your community.  Yeah.  They shouldn't be freaked out by their rights.  I'm not freaked out by you exercising yours. ",

We have not been impolite to you.  And I can be rude if I want, but we chose not to be.  But he doesn't have to answer your questions.  He doesn't have to.  He was kind enough to not... There's no reasonable suspicion.  he committed a crime.  He didn't have to answer the officer's question.  But he wanted the officer to know that you were safe.  Guess what?  I can promise you I'm putting it up on YouTube.  Millions of people will see it because you know what I'm doing?  I'm filming from a public place.  There's no expectation of privacy in public and I can't trespass what my eyes can see.  So it will be on YouTube.  End of conversation.  End of conversation.  You're doing a good job, officer.

Yeah, with all the bad press coverage Anderson's been getting, we finally show him doing a good job and you have a meltdown.  Bye, Karen.  Let me get a good close-up for you for the thumbnail.  That's the thumbnail.  Don't move.  Perfect.  Thank you.  Bye, Karen.  No, I want you to look up Karen on YouTube.  I got the name right.  You're welcome.  We just want to educate you.  And if we can't, I'll learn something from you right now because I don't have to be as abrasive because you're very calm.  And now next time you see someone, you can call the police and say, hey, listen, I fear for my safety.  I don't think this looks right.  I'm not saying they're doing anything wrong.  They're on a public sidewalk.  They're just filming.  Now we can both leave here and we bridge the gap.  And the Anderson PD is getting some good press. ",

And it was the same exact call, us standing in a public place.  And this officer came here.  They simply just wanted to know, are you committing a crime?  Do you have any ill intent?  He said no.  And from that point on, it was a non-issue.  He might disagree with our methods, he said, but it's all right to do it.  And you guys have been getting some bad press, and I'm a big part of that bad press, when you do something wrong.  But when you do something right, you deserve to know about it.
