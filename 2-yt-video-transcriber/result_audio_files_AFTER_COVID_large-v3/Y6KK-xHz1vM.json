            "text": "You know, when I was a little girl, my grandparents raised me and we were raised with the value of marriage.  My dad's parents raised me as their own, and they've been married for almost 50 years now.  And they're happily married.  All the women in my family have been married long-term and You know, the women in my family are the strongest women, okay?  They're respectable, they're classy, they respect their husbands, they take care of their husbands, and they're deserving of a good husband.  And that's why their husbands take care of them in return because they're deserving of it.  always teach people that when it comes to relationships you get back what you put out.  so there's a lot of people contact me saying oh I can't find a good man.  I can't you know find anyone to treat me right.  well change yourself first.  you get back what you put out.  so you know when I grew up I couldn't wait to get married.  that was very important to me because of the values I was raised with.  you know I was raised to take your vows seriously.  it's not.  You know, your spouse is not something disposable.  Once one little thing doesn't work out, you don't just dispose of your spouse like a used pair of shoes.  It's sacred.  And, you know, my husband and I got married and we've been married for coming up on 13 years this September.  We are raising our children with those same values.  You know, when I think of why divorce is so common and why so many marriages are not lasting forever, The first thing I think of is feminism.  A lot of you that have been watching me for a while know how I feel about feminism, because I don't agree with any feminism whatsoever.  I don't care what wave we're on.  I don't care why it came about or how it was in the beginning.  I don't agree with any feminism whatsoever, because I see the damage that it's done.  And it's not there because it really gives a damn about women.  Feminism is there just to destroy the family.  It's there to destroy society.  Just like liberalism, it's the same thing.  It's all these Marxist ideas.  Now, I remember years ago on YouTube watching a blue-haired feminist, and she said in a video, We're coming and we're coming to destroy everything.  We're going to call everything racist and sexist and we're coming to destroy everything.  And that's really what they've done.  And nowadays women are more unhappy now than they've ever been before.  And it has everything to do with buying the lie of feminism.  and Don't get me wrong.  Y'all the indoctrination of women with this feminism is so powerful.  It's so strong.  I mean, it's in the commercials, the TV shows, the talk shows, the movies, the books, the mainstream media, it is everywhere.  And it's just propaganda.  every way you look and women, the women that do buy into it end up very unfulfilled and very unhappy.  Women were told that, you know, you can be more like men.  You're equal to men.  You can be like a man.  You can be promiscuous and still feel good about yourself as a woman and still be deserving of a high quality man.  You can, uh, you know, climb the corporate ladder, make it all the way to the top, uh, make a lot of money and be selfish, be all about yourself, travel, go on all these adventures, do not have children or put that off until later in life.  You know, put off having a husband until later in life, sleep around with as many men as you want to first.  And then later in life, you'll be deserving of a good husband.  Um, and it's just a big lie because women have a biological clock.  we are not fertile you know.  we lose our fertility the older we get.  and you know I don't care what y'all seen on TV with these celebrities because there's a lot of lies and manipulation going on with these celebrities being pregnant their late 40s and their 50s.  women were not biologically designed to have children that late in life.  so it becomes harder and if you do get pregnant at that age the miscarriage rate is very very high.  it's very unlikely you'll carry the term.  so women are being lied to about all this.  and if you're promiscuous as a woman and you sleep around and then decide at 40 that you want a quality man you're not going to be able to attract the quality man.  no quality man's going to want a washed up used up old washcloth.  and uh so feminism's been lying to women destroying women.  women are more unhappy than they've ever been before and i think that has lot to do with why our divorce rate is so high.  women are not staying in the role of a woman.  you know they're trying to wear the pants and it's just.  it's unnatural.  it's not the way we're biologically made.  women were biologically made to be nurturing emotional caring compassionate loving.  you know we bear the children.  every person watching this video a woman carried you for nine months in her womb.  a woman went through all the aches and pains the nausea and vomiting the The weight gain and the back aches, I could go on and on.  It is not easy carrying a child.  And then every one of us was a woman gave birth to all of us, every one of us.  OK, she had to go through the labor and the delivery of having us.  And, you know, for for the lucky ones out there, your mom stuck around and took care of you after, which is even harder, you know.  But women have a very important job.  feminism taught them that you know don't do that job.  you can be more than that.  you can be so much more than just someone spitting out kids for some man.  and you know it's all a lie because women's most important job is having children.  being mothers.  that's what we're biologically made to do.  you know.  it's.  it's the most important job a woman will ever have.  not saying it's the only thing a woman can do but it's her most important job above everything else.  so women are not staying in the role as women anymore.  they're trying to wear the pants they're trying to be really masculine and dominant and that just doesn't work.  it's unnatural because the man is supposed to be that way.  you can't have two people in the relationship like that.  it's.  it's like I said it's very unbalanced and unnatural and it's just not going to last.  the marriage is not going to last like that and also women were being in the workforce and think that has done a lot of damage to marriages you know because at a time years and years and years back women stayed home.  they they they had the children and back then women had an average of five children.  I think in the 50s the average American family had five or more children.  nowadays the average married American family has one and a half to two children tops.  So back then, I'm sure all of you watching, your grandmothers had probably about five or six children.  My grandmothers had five and six children.  My husbands had nine children on one side.  and I think on the other side it was even more so.  back then women had more children.  they were staying at home raising the children running the household and that's a hard job on its own.  I mean think about it.  you have school homework studying teachers conferences dentist appointments doctor appointments.  you know the grocery shopping cooking cleaning laundry baths.  I mean I could just go on and on on top of being pregnant and you know giving birth to other children and nursing a baby when you have a baby but that was a very hard thing already.  imagine those women now being in the workforce and still having to come home and do all that other stuff.  It's too much.  So now we have both parents in the workforce coming home late in the evening, stressed out, tired, exhausted, and the woman still has to do all this other stuff.  It's too much.  It wasn't designed to be that way.  And so women going into the workforce again ties into feminism.  So most of my reasons tie into feminism.  So those are my main reasons.  Marriage is not disposable.  I feel like in our society, people are very quick to dispose of a marriage.  It's not looked at as sacred anymore.  They've taken, you know, this progressive left that is trying to take over.  They have taken everything that's good and wholesome and decent away and destroyed it.  And marriage is one of those things.  It's looked at as just disposable.  And, oh, it's not working out.  Let's just get divorced.  And that's not the way it was supposed to be.  It's very sacred and serious.  But if there's anything that I missed, comment below.  What do you think some reasons why the divorce rate is so high?  I'm curious to read it.  And I will see y'all back on my next video. ",
