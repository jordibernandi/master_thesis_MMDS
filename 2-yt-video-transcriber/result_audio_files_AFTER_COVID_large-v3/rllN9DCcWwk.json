So I had to investigate.  It was 7.25 a.m.  and I immediately sent an email, a media inquiry to the Royal Children's Hospital.  I thought that answered me by lunchtime once everyone gets in after 9 a.m.  and they had time to investigate the story.  But no, 25 minutes later, 7.50  a.m.,  I got this sharp response.  The Royal Children's Hospital has no involvement with Lance Simon, nor do we have ambassadors at the Royal Children's Hospital.  I note in the Facebook video, Mr.  Simon indicated he would be visiting the Royal Children's Hospital today.  However, he will not be able to enter as we have a number of COVID-19 visitor restrictions.  Imagine my shock, eh?  And what do you know?

And finally, the promoter's address listed in the terms and conditions is none other than the gangland lawyer's office herself.  So I decided to call Lance and put the questions to him directly.  G'day Lance, Avi Yamini here from Rebel News.  How you doing mate?  Hey Avi, how are ya?  Keep in mind, I made this phone call before I was sent Lance's death threat.  I'm not sure if my investigation prompted his threat, but once I received it, I passed it straight to police and made no other attempt to contact him.  You can imagine why.

I just answered this question.  Mate, you're online all day talking about... Apparently you're online all day talking about scammers and it seems like... Let me read one of the conditions of this raffle you've been promoting.  It says, the promoter may in its absolute discretion not accept a particular entry, may disqualify an entry or cancel the entire promotion at any time without giving reasons and without liability.  Mate... I feel like you're part of a scam.  Nice try, Harvey.  What a surprise.  Lance couldn't or wouldn't answer any of the questions and told me to contact his gangland lawyer wife, Zara.  So I sent her an email with my questions and quickly received back this response.  My practice's only association with Melbourne Jet Ski Hire is as a sponsor.  and any questions about their trade promotion should be directed to Melbourne Jetski Hire.  Of note, my practice's mailing address is Serviced Offices, whereupon thousands of businesses are registered.  Okay, that seems a little convenient.  that the lottery fundraiser her husband is heavily promoting, that he said he only joined on her recommendation, happens to be sponsored, whatever that actually means, and addressed to her office.  But no worries.  I'm persistent.  I emailed the questions to the company.  Guess who answered?  Her law clerk, which is like a legal secretary.  The same bloke that features in some of Lance's videos.  Mitch starts off by warning me not to defame their company.  Then says, Sponsors are businesses that have provided their services to assist in the promotion.  I'm not sure what Guard Wilson lawyers did to assist in the promotion of Melbourne Jetski unless... Lance is the Guard Wilson promoter, which would explain why he's often sitting in front of their banners.  Then he goes on to say, what you are referring to is a trade promotion, not a raffle.  Trade promotions as such are not required for registration in all states and territories.  No such permit exists under the Victorian framework and trade promotion payments to charities are not a legal requirement by law and are made out of goodwill to the stated charity at the discretion of the campaign.  Then he goes on to recommend I acquire some legal advice, but I had a better idea.  I called the regulator.  In Victoria, raffles can only be run for charitable or community purposes, so for fundraising.  You can't run a raffle for personal gain or profit.  So businesses can't run raffles, essentially.  Okay, so they have to be associated to a charity, is that right?  Yes, raising funds for a charity or community organisation.  Every single cent of the raffle has to go to a community or charitable organisation and be run on behalf of the community or charitable organisation with their permissions, and if necessary, a minor gaming permit.  So when would they need the permit?  So the permit's required when either standard conditions aren't followed, so that depends on the prize pool value of the raffle, or when the prize pool value of the raffle is over $5,000.  Okay, so a raffle that the prize is $40,000, there would be no reason why it wouldn't be unregistered?  It would definitely need to be. ",
