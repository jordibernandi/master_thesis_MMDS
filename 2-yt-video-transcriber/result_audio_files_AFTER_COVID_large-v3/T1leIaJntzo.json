Not going to respond.  The trajectory is clear.  The speed of departure is increasing.  First, it should be noted that I responded to Dr.  White's tweet explaining that a five-minute video had been produced as a summary to help those who are not willing to deal with the longer, more in-depth videos.  The word trajectory seems to imply that something about my soteriology has changed over the years since we first met in our debate, but this is simply not true.  This only goes to demonstrate that Dr.  White never has understood our sociological perspective in such a way to be qualified to rebut it.  Of course, the trajectory he's speaking of is into full-blown Pelagianism, as he states it. ",

            "text": "this boogeyman label has been addressed a number of times by provisionists and traditionalists like dr david allen and myself here at sociology one o one but is yet to be responded to by dr white or any notable calvinistic scholar.  In Dr.  White's short-sighted and ill-informed effort to discredit our perspective, he has resorted to what is known as the boogeyman fallacy.  This is a certain type of argument which, in fact, is not an argument at all, but a means of forestalling discussion and erroneously labeling an opponent's position with that of a known heresy so as to demonize and discredit it.  For example, someone in a political debate might say, look, his view sounds like something Hitler said once, so you shouldn't listen to him anymore.  Hitler is a known boogeyman or a bad character, so if I can associate my opponent's view with Hitler, then I'll discredit him altogether.  likewise pelagius has become the calvinist's go-to boogeyman and many of them will stop at nothing to slap that label on us so as to marginalize and discredit anything we say.  this method bears a certain resemblance to the ad hominem fallacy and comes from the same root motivation discredit and marginalize the person and their views rather than objectively evaluating and offering a sound non fallacious biblical rebuttal.  the ad hominem fallacy consists of attempting to refute an argument by impeaching the character of its proponent whereas the boogeyman fallacy seeks to associate an argument with that of someone whose character or belief has already been impeached like that of hitler or pelagius.  this would be like an arminian calling dr albert moeller a semi hyper calvinist on the basis that he teaches something similar to the views of that of known hyper calvinists those who deny the need of evangelism.  or if a unitarian accused dr white of being a semi catholic because he affirms the doctrine of the trinity.  this is pure guilt by association and it is the lazy man's approach to avoid an otherwise rational and informed discussion of the issues.  those who resort to such tactics either do not know any better or they are nefariously attempting to marginalize and demonize the views of those who disagree with them.  typically the accusation comes from those who are less informed about the historical use of these labels and their actual meanings as it relates to our current soteriological disagreements.  so let's get educated.  pelagius was a fifth century british monk who was accused of teaching that people had the natural ability to fulfil the commands of god by an exercise of the human will.  apart from divine assistance or grace Pelagianism came to be known as the belief that mankind is born basically good, without a sinful nature, and thus capable of doing good without God's help.  Because Pelagius was deemed a heretic, little of his work survived to the present day, except in the quotes of his opponents, not the most reliable of sources.  Many modern scholars suspect that Pelagius' actual teachings were greatly misrepresented, so as to demonize and marginalize him.  and this is not too difficult to imagine.  despite what is commonly known of pelagius evidence indicates that he and his followers taught that all good works come only by divine aid or grace which was seen as enabling not irresistible in nature.  plagius wrote this grace.  we for our part do not as you suppose allow to consist merely in the law but also in the help of god.  god helps us by his teaching and revelation whilst he opens the eyes of our heart whilst he points out to us the future that we may not be absorbed in the present whilst he discovers to us the snares of the devil whilst he enlighten us with the manifold and ineffable gift of heavenly grace.  this free-will is in all good works always assisted by divine help free will.  we do so own as to say we always stand in need of god's help.  so while pelagius maintained human responsibility to keep the commands of god he still seemed to maintain the need for divine aid in doing so.  Augustine, a contemporary of Pelagius, even by Calvinistic scholars' own admission, was the first on record to teach the concept of individual effectual election to salivation.  John Calvin himself admitted as much when he wrote, further, \"'Even though the Greeks, above the rest, and Christosom especially among them, extol the ability of the human will,'.  yet all the ancients save augustine so differ waver or speak confusedly on the subject that almost nothing certain can be derived from their writings.  so by calvinists own admission augustine introduced much of these unique and often controversial doctrinal beliefs in the fifth century.  For further investigation into this subject, we highly recommend the book from Dr.  Ken Wilson called The Foundation of Augustinian Calvinism.  You can also look back through the videos here at Sociology 101 and see our interviews with Dr.  Wilson.  So, in the 5th century debate, Pelagius accused Augustine of being under the influence of his former Manichaean or Gnostic roots.  which was known to teach pagan fatalism as if it were Christian doctrine.  Augustine, in turn, accused Pelagius of denying any need for divine aid in the conversion process.  It is likely that both of them went too far in their accusations against the other, which is common among those who debate with each other.  But history reveals, at least in Western orthodoxy, that it was Augustine's smear of Pelagius that won over in the court of public opinion.  plagianism therefore has become known historically as the teaching that man has the capacity to seek god in and of himself apart from any movement of god or the holy spirit and therefore that salvation is effected by man's efforts.  Provisionists, like myself, wholeheartedly deny this belief and consider the label offensive and completely misrepresentative of our actual teachings.  Here are a few reasons why this label would not rightly represent our views.  1.  We believe man has the capacity to respond willingly to God's means of seeking to save the lost, not that man would seek God if left alone.  2.  We believe our gracious God is actively working in and through creation, conscience, His bride, His Holy Spirit-filled followers, and His Word to aid humanity in their conversion.  3.  We believe salvation is wholly of God, in that He owes no man forgiveness or eternal life, even if they freely repent and humbly submit to Him as Lord and Savior.  Asking for forgiveness no more merits that forgiveness than the prodigal son's return home merited the reception he received from his father.  That was a choice of a gracious father alone.  But what about the label semi-Pelagianism?  Does that fit the provisionist?  First, it should be noted that the term semi-Pelagian was first introduced in the late 16th century by Calvinistic theologians attempting to combat the rising popularity of Molinism, an alternative method of reconciling the problem of divine omniscience and human freedom.  One reputable Calvinistic source defines it this way, quote, Semi-Pelagianism, a weaker form of Pelagianism, did not deny original sin and its effects upon the human soul and will, but it taught that God and man cooperate to achieve man's salvation.  This cooperation is not by human effort, as in keeping the law, but rather in the ability of the person to make a free will choice.  the semi pelagian teaches that man can make the first move toward god by seeking god out of his own free will and that man can co-operate with god's grace even to the keeping of his faith through human effort.  this would mean that god responds to the initial effort of a person and that god's grace is not absolutely necessary to maintain faith.  first do provisionists like myself believe that god and man co-operate to achieve man's salvation?  of course not.  Let me ask this question to reveal the error of this accusation.  Did the prodigal son and his father cooperate to achieve the son's restoration, or was that a gracious choice of the father alone upon the son's return?  The false belief that forgiveness is somehow owed to those who freely humble themselves and ask for it leads to erroneous conclusions such as this.  Second, do provisionists like myself teach that, quote, man can make the first move toward God by seeking God out of his own free will, end quote?  Absolutely not.  And I would challenge anyone to find any provisionist scholar who teaches this nonsense.  Third, do provisionists teach that, quote, God responds to the initial effort of a person, end quote?  No.  No.  Please listen.  Belief that mankind is able to willingly respond to the gracious means of God to seek and save the lost is not equal to mankind making, quote, the first move toward God.  If it was proven that I could not call the President of the United States on the phone, would you also conclude, based on that information, that it would be impossible for me to answer the phone if the President tried to call me?  Of course not, but that is exactly what those who are accusing us of semi-Pelagianism are doing.  If provisionists can rightly be labeled semi-Pelagian, then by that standard we could conclude that Calvinists are semi-Gnostic.  After all, those were the two groups promoting the extremes of both views in the fourth and fifth centuries.  I would rather avoid such demonizing labels altogether, and actually practice the principle of sola scriptura, Scripture alone as our authority, rather than appealing to ancient Catholic labels created by men who were known for their often violent and extreme intolerance of dissenting views.  How about we approach each other with patience, kindness, and good intentions?  Let us not repeat the mistakes of those who led the Church into the Inquisition and other horrific abuses of dissenters, but instead set a better example for theological discourse to all who come after us.
