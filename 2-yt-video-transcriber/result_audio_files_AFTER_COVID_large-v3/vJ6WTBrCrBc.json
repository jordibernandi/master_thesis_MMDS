            "text": "It's with a bit of irony that I make use of the phrase that we are indeed living in interesting times.  As many of you know, it's alleged that that's an old Chinese saying, may you live in interesting times, used to reference not so much interesting times but perhaps difficult times.  although with a tinge of interest.  And as we all know, COVID is raging, and it's the talk of the town, the city, the state, the country, and indeed the world.  And apparently, to the best of our knowledge, it originated in China, of all places.  And it's very, very interesting in terms of the psychology of human beings, how people are reacting.  I'm sure you've seen some of the massive and hyperbolic toilet paper runs, as opposed to food storage or what have you.  Among other things, some people completely downplaying the risk and danger, whilst other people going insanely in the opposite direction.  Now, if anything, I think COVID is a good example of how we are not really prepared for very much of anything.  That would probably be a talk for the future more than anything else.  Needless to say, one point I want to drive home before I get to the meat and potatoes of the video, which is more Manosphere related, is that we don't really know how we're going to act or react when the fecal matter hits the fan, as it were.  We don't know how we're going to think, what we're going to say, what we're going to do.  None of us is a clairvoyant, and it's very hard to predict human behavior within reason, and certainly more specifically individual human behavior.  With all of that said, I want to take the time to talk about a topic that is recurrent and nonetheless very topical, because it revolves around the idea of red pills.  It revolves around the idea of the distinction between knowledge and internalizing that knowledge, where I would argue that the internalization is virtually necessitated by the experiential, which is to say you have to experience something to really internalize it.  It's one thing to comprehend something, on an intellectual level, for example.  It's another thing to fully have the lessons of the information absorbed be driven home.  And the topic I want to talk about today is red-pilled men, specifically younger men, but not exclusively younger men.  They think they get women.  They think they understand their relationships with women or lack thereof, and they think they understand the big picture.  And it's entirely possible that they do indeed understand the entire picture with respect to them, men more broadly, and women.  Maybe even some of them understand the nitty-gritty of the biology involved and the evolution behind it.  Entirely possible.  But what I've noticed throughout the years is that when push comes to shove, The walls tend to come crumbling down, which is to say this phenomenon I've observed of men saying one thing, informed as they are, very much strongly possessed of their convictions, that's one thing.  But what happens when the rubber meets the road?  It's a bit, like I said, like COVID.  People don't know how they're going to react.  They never really thought about it.  Only this time, they think they know exactly how they're going to react.  So some guy who might be 21, 22, maybe even 25, not a tremendous amount of experience with women, but some experience, they think they have it figured out.  They think they know how they're going to react.  They think they're going to be able to override their instincts simply with knowledge.  But what happens?  and what have I observed?  I watched the wall just crumble down.  I've watched them turn into pure simps, begging for the attention and affection of women, going all out.  Now, this is an exclusive to Red Pill Man.  I remember a story told to me about a family friend's son.  with the tender age of 18, based in the States, fell in love with some female New Zealander.  So what does he do?  He works a summer job and works his butt off to save enough money to fly out there.  As you know, that's a day-plus flight.  Ridiculous.  And stay there for a few months.  Goes back and forth for a while.  Eventually, after a year, just peters out because she breaks up.  All that time, money, and energy wasted.  The investment for naught.  Because, presumably, he didn't learn anything from that.  And I've seen similar things with red pill men.  They've convinced themselves that they're immune to their instincts.  that with all their knowledge, that given a sufficiently attractive female, their own walls, their own barriers would not crumble.  And yet, more often than not, the opposite occurs.  More often than not, I see them just turn into normal men, whether it's through simping, expending large amounts of money, paying large amounts of attention to her unnecessarily, oftentimes with little to no reward, et cetera, et cetera.  And there is a youth factor here without doubt because this is the point of experience being necessary to reinforce the knowledge that you have.  Understanding the abstract is all well and good, but if it doesn't have application, and has one apply knowledge, one applies knowledge by doing, it becomes very, very difficult.  The men who typically don't allow their instincts to override their common sense or the knowledge they've acquired are a bit battle-hardened, usually older, which leads to the difficult question that I've thought about for years now.  What do you do with the younger men who don't have a lot of experience but they're given and I do mean a ton of information in terms of how these sexual dynamics actually work in the real world.  They're given a theoretical model, but they lack the ability to apply it properly because, frankly speaking, they didn't go through the experiences that would allow the optimal application of that.  Now, in some cases, there might be other avenues to go about this through other possibilities that allow them to channel their instincts and their intuitions.  But more often than not, even if they're doing, quote, unquote, all the right things in the context of going their own way, I have seen them when they have encountered a female crumble and fall apart, and at the very least get very upset by the revelation that indeed she was just another female, just another woman, whatever, nothing special.  Worst case scenario, I've seen them spend tremendous amounts of money, multiple flights, investment, time, energy, as if they had forgotten all the lessons they had been taught.  And I think, my conviction at least, is that it's based on just lack of experience.  It's probably one of the most powerful instincts out there, and it's very, very likely going to override any knowledge you've possessed regarding women, yourself, and the world more broadly.  That's just the way it works.  And so this is the quandary that I think young men who are going their own way, and in general, in the manosphere, face.  Do you want to just go through the dirty laundry and deal with all these issues early on to the extent that you can, to the extent that you have access to it, acquiring the experiences that one might argue are necessary to not only diagnose the problem but react appropriately?  Just to say when the rubber does meet the road, you're not allowing your instincts and intuitions to override your good sense and your reason.  the knowledge and information that you've acquired, or do you avoid it, essentially through hearsay, secondhand information passed on to you?  Ultimately, that's up to every man to decide how he wants to go about that.  But I simply want to point out and highlight the fact that if you spent the majority of your time, particularly if you're young, in the abstract realm of the manosphere, without any real-world application of that stuff, You could end up in a difficult situation if and when you're in a position or situation where you're dealing with a real female where for whatever reason she's managed to bewitch you and you find yourself falling for her.  You might even know about the details of what's going on in your endocrinology, in your brain, but you're still falling for it.  Most of that is just being hardwired to do this sort of thing.  So I think we actually have a serious issue in the sense that we can say one thing, and I've tried to hammer home this lesson for a very long time indeed, that there is a distinction between internalizing knowledge through experience and simply acquiring knowledge, especially when it comes to your basic instincts.  We're not talking about studying or learning something for examination or some abstract piece of knowledge about the biology of giraffes here.  We're talking about you learning about things that are about you.  And then you go out in the real world and you start meeting females and then you don't really know what to do because your instincts are pushing you inexorably in one direction.  But everything you learned is telling you, caution, caution, caution, maybe not, perhaps not at all.  And you're not really sure what to do.  Needless to say, in the examples I've mentioned previously, these guys, when it inevitably fails, come back to their senses and they don't know what had gotten hold of them.  So there's a kind of weird lose-lose situation here.  Because if you're young and you know the experience, well, you have to ask yourself, what do you do when you are confronted by it?  And those instincts kick in.  But on the other hand, going through the experience is probably going to be a loss of time, energy, and money, simply reinforcing what you already knew.  And that's the problem, I think, that men almost universally face, especially young men these days who are inculcated into this set of ideas.  The ideas aren't wrong.  The problem is applying them in real time, when you encounter that cutie who's smiling at you with her jug of sore eye jiggling at you.  And all you can think about is that.  What do you do in that situation?  Because that's really where it counts.  Can you resist it?  Well, based on my observations, more often than not, young men especially cannot.  Now am I saying they should just run after these females and just follow their instincts irrespective?  Absolutely not.  What I am saying is this is a problem that needs to be highlighted at the very least and talked about.  Because a lot of these guys are going to end up, despite all the knowledge they have, getting hurt, hurting themselves, and losing a lot in this process.  And that's something we just don't talk about often in the atmosphere.  We often just talk about the theoretical, but we never talk about how to apply that and how we get around that.  And it might be that we can't get around, especially as a young man.  Maybe you do need, and that's kind of my conviction, that experience to reinforce the knowledge, or maybe not, maybe there are other avenues.  But in any event, it is important food for thought, because I'm sure there are guys out there who are going to listen to this who can identify this very behavior in themselves.  They have all the knowledge, they're red-pilled, whatever, and then they encounter a cutesy-wootsy, so to speak, and then boom, they're in a situation where their pee-pee is directing everything they're doing.  and they just can't get enough.  It's intoxicating.  The knowledge, not so much, but the interaction with the female and the satiation of these instincts is.  In the coming months, I'm going to think more about this problem and for possible solutions or compromises because I think we do need to find some compromise, especially for young men on this point.  In any event, please enjoy your weekend.  Be safe in light of the quote-unquote.  interesting times we live in.  You know what I'm referencing there.  As always, may the gods watch over you.
