            "text": "Hi everybody, Bionic Dance here.  So, uh, my computer, that is to say my production machine, what I usually edit video on, just died a miserable death.  I don't know exactly what was happening, I was cleaning cat fur out of it, and when I started to boot it back up again, nothing.  Like all the lights turned on, but it didn't even do the diagnostic where it goes beep and lets you know everything's cool and then starts booting windows, nothing on the monitor at all.  even though, like I said, the fans start going, all the lights turn on.  Needless to say, this is going to put a crimp in any plans.  I might have to release a video anytime soon.  So I just thought I'd give you guys a heads up.  Now, I am not asking for money.  I'm not asking for help.  I got the dough to not merely fix the computer, but to upgrade the hell out of it.  So I brought it to the computer place, kind of locked out, actually.  The guy was working alone throughout most of the pandemic, and he just hired a new guy, and that new guy enabled him to offer rush jobs again, right?  And so I paid like 50 extra bucks, and I should have my diagnosis by tomorrow instead of by next week, so rock.  I think I'm going to have him upgrade the hell out of the machine.  It's nearly... like 10 years old, not quite, but nearly.  And the only thing in there, like I replaced the GPU less than a year ago.  I think it was October.  Not sure, but regardless, I think I might have them replace the CPU and a bunch of other stuff just so it's faster.  This is my production machine.  It's what I make the animation on.  My render farm is fine, but this is my production machine.  So With that said, yeah, I just thought I'd update everyone, let them know the state of the channel currently.  I'll be back as soon as I can, promise.  But until then, catch you like the plague.  Have fun. ",
