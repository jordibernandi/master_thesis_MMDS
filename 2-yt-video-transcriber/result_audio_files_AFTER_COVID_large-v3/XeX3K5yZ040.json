            "text": "Hello and welcome to another episode in our series State of the Election.  With former Vice President and presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden now having made his VP choice in the form of Senator Kamala Harris of California, two official predictions on the outcome of the election and an apparent second spike in coronavirus cases, there's a lot to talk about right now.  So in this video, we're going to take a look at the dynamic that Kamala Harris brings to the ticket, the predictions of who's going to win, and how this second spike could influence the decision.

So, we now know that Joe Biden has tapped California Senator Kamala Harris.  The daughter of a Jamaican father and an Indian mother, Harris became the first Indian-American and the first African-American woman to be nominated for the ticket of a major political party, and if elected, would be the first woman to hold either of the top offices of the country.  Now, the question is, how does the selection of Harris help or hurt Biden's chances?  Well, if the last few days have been any indication, given the energy and fundraising Harris has brought to the Biden campaign, it may prove Harris has been a valuable asset to the campaign.  In the 24 hours following the announcement, the Biden campaign raised over $25 million.  I'm sure we don't need to point this out, but we're going to anyway.  That's pretty good for 24 hours.  So time will tell.  But right now, it looks like Biden made the right choice.  In a previous episode of this series, we discussed Alan Lichtman's model for predicting US presidential elections.  We didn't make any official predictions, and we are still not going to.  But now, Professor Lichtman has made his official prediction, and we were fortunate enough to have the opportunity to speak with him about it.  And we definitely want to thank him up front for allowing us the chance to discuss it with him.  We really appreciate it, Dr.  Lichtman.  Anyway, if you've been following our series, you'll recall that the professor's model uses 13 qualifying statements that are either rated as true or false.  And if seven or more of these keys go against the incumbent party, they're predicted to lose the White House.  Let's review the keys quickly and then discuss Professor Lichtman's prediction.  Party mandate, whether the party in power has gained or lost seats in the midterm.  Party contest, whether there was a serious primary challenge to the sitting president.  Incumbency, whether the sitting president is running for re-election.  Third party challenge, is there a serious third party candidate?  Short term economy, is the economy in recession?  Long term economy, has economic growth exceeded that of the previous two terms?  Policy change, have there been major changes to national policy?  Social unrest, is there prolonged social unrest?  Scandal, is the current administration free from major scandals?  Foreign stroke military failure, has there been a military or foreign policy failure?  Foreign stroke military success, has there been a military or foreign policy success?  incumbent charisma, and challenger charisma, which both deal with whether a candidate is inspiring and a charismatic figure.  So, using these 13 keys, who does Professor Lichtman predict will win the election of 2020?  Drumroll please, it's Joe Biden.  Sorry Trump supporters, but according to Professor Lichtman's model, Joe Biden is predicted to become the 46th President of the United States.  now after speaking with professor lickman and getting his take on the model we can clarify with certainty which candidate wins each of the keys.  so let's go through them one by one.  in our original video we tried to predict which way each of the keys would go and we were correct on our analysis of the first four keys.  The first key goes in Biden's column because the Democrats took control of the House of Representatives in 2018, while keys two, three and four all go for Trump because he faced no serious primary challenger, is running for reelection and is thus the incumbent.  And despite the candidacy of Kanye West, Professor Lichtman sees this as a two horse race.  In our last video on this, we discussed the short term economy, and pointed out that the current recession is a result of the coronavirus, but that voters might hold Trump ultimately accountable for his handling of the pandemic, and thus the economic crisis as well.  Ultimately, we put the key in Trump's column and said that we might have to take it out in the future.  Well, according to Professor Lichtman, the key would not go in Trump's column because there is indeed a recession and Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic impacts the shape of the economic recovery.  So Professor Lichtman contends that if the administration had done a better job of handling the pandemic, the economic impact would not have been so bad.  As to the long-term economic key, we left that one up in the air.  But as with the short-term economic key, Professor Lichtman says that the pandemic takes this key away from Trump's column due to the economic hit of the virus.  We were correct in our analysis of the seventh key.  President Trump has made serious changes to national policy from the previous administration, so this is a key for Trump.  The social unrest key, we again left up in the air at the time.  But that was in early July, and we said that only time would tell.  Now it's mid-August, and while the social unrest may have calmed down a bit, it's still going on.  So we now know that this key would not go in Trump's column, and Professor Lichtman agrees.  We left the scandal key in the maybe column because of the first with Donald Trump.  As we pointed out when we made the first video, none of the presidents who have ever been impeached went on to run for re-election, so there wasn't exactly a precedent there.  However, Professor Lichtman says that's unimportant.  The fact is, not only was Donald Trump impeached, but he's been plagued by several other controversies, including the less than flattering picture painted of him, by his former attorney Michael Cohen.  As such, Trump doesn't get this key.  Professor Lichtman says that while there have been some close calls in terms of Trump's foreign policy, he's not had any major failures in that arena, and thus this is a key in his column.  However, he's also not had any major foreign policy successes either, so that key goes in Biden's column.  The last two keys we left with you, the viewers, to decide, as they both deal with the charisma of the candidates.  But Lichtman maintains that neither candidate is, to use his words, a once-in-a-generation inspiring candidate such as Ronald Reagan in 1980 or Barack Obama in 2008.  Both Biden and Trump receive a key here.  So if you've been keeping track, Biden ends up with seven keys while Trump holds only six.  As such, Lichtman's model means that Biden is predicted to win.  And considering the historic success of the Lichtman model and its ability to predict all recent presidential elections, this should be a worrying sign for the Trump campaign.  Now, as we said in the opening, we have two official predictions.  So who is the other predictor and what's the prediction?  Helmut Norpoff is a professor of political science at Stony Brook University in New York, and he developed the primary model, which predicts the outcome of a general election based on the performance of the two candidates in their respective primary parties.  It also relies on the election cycle that favors the incumbent advantage, as shown in this chart of elections since 1960.  As you can see, after one term in office, the incumbent party is favored to win the White House, whereas after two terms, they're favored to lose.  As such, this coupled with his performance in the primaries, Professor Norpoff gives President Trump a 91% chance of reelection.  The professor also maintains that history, to use his words, is littered with nominees who saw a lead in the polls in the spring to turn to dust in the fall, including Thomas Dewey in 1948, Richard Nixon in 1960, and John Kerry in 2004, to name just a few.  So, how accurate is this model?  Well, according to his website, for the record, the primary model picks the winner of 25 out of 27 elections since 1912, when presidential primaries were introduced.  It misses a 1960, one of the closest presidential elections, and 2000, when the late Count of Florida handed Bush the victory.  Still, Al Gore wound up winning the popular vote.  So, as both models we've discussed have been fairly accurate, we'll have to wait and see who is right and who is wrong this time round.  That said, there's one point to consider with regards to the primary model.  Primaries are elections within a party, so they don't involve independent voters.  Florida and Pennsylvania, for example, have closed primaries, meaning only registered members of the party can vote in the primary.  This leaves independent voters out of the primary process in those states.  and while some states do allow voters to vote through open primaries, the fact still stands that there's a proportion of the population who doesn't weigh in until election day, and furthermore, the importance of voters in crucial swing states.  So the general election is the first time that those voters weigh in on the candidates, and the question becomes, who do the voters swing to?  It's worth pointing out that in 2016, a key group of Donald Trump's supporters were those who made their decision at the last minute.  So again, it looks like we'll just have to wait and see.  Anyway, we know you're probably tired of hearing us talk about the coronavirus, but as the US seems to be in the middle of a second spike at the moment, it's worth us talking about in the context of the election.  In the past couple of weeks, schools have begun to reopen, and thousands of students, teachers, and staff have been sent home.  And that could certainly be a problem for President Trump, especially given his push to reopen schools, even threatening to pull federal funding for schools that refuse to reopen.  Back in May, the World Health Organization issued guidance to governments that, before reopening, positivity rates in testing should remain below 5% for at least 14 days.  And according to data from Johns Hopkins University, only 17 states meet that qualification.  As for our part at TLDR, we're not going to make any predictions.  It's unclear how this second spike will impact the election.  And even if the second spike doesn't impact the election, then students across the country getting sick and staying home from school might.  We'll just have to wait and see how these things develop.  After all, we still have two and a half months until the decision, and a lot can happen in the meantime.  What do you think about these issues though?  Will Harris help or hurt Biden?  Do you agree with Professor Lichtman's predictions or Professor Northoff's?  And do you think the second spike will affect Trump's chances?
