            "text": "Oh, yo!  The house I don't even live in has been vandalized by out-of-work, hungry poor people who haven't gotten their stimulus check.  I better call for help.  Go for Chuck!  Hey, Chuck, it's Nancy.  Are you busy?  Nah, I'm not busy.  I'm just doing a press conference with, um, what's-his-name.  Chuck, surely poor people vandalized my house!  What?  Call the police, Nancy!  We can't let poor people get away with this!  Sorry, Pete!  What were you talking about?  Hello?  Thank you for calling your friendly neighborhood social worker.  How can I assist you?  Oops.  Hang on.  I have another call.  Thanks for calling your friendly neighborhood social worker.  Help!  Help!  My house has been vandalized by out-of-work poor people.  Hang on.  I need to put you on hold.  Hello?  Is this the police?  No, I'm sorry.  We don't do that anymore.  You don't do what anymore?  We don't do police anymore.  We've been defended.  Did you take care of Pelosi's house?  Yeah.  Did you take care of McConnell's house?  Of course I did.  Hey, bartender, bring me another pina colada.  Hey, Bill?  Yeah?  Why is Jeffrey ordering pi\u00f1a coladas at the beach?  Uh, Jeffrey?  Uh, Jeffrey who?  Don't play stupid with me, Bill!  Why is Jeffrey at the beach?  Uh, well, I thought you were going to take care of that.  No, Bill!  You weren't supposed to take care of that!  Why didn't you take care of that, Bill?  Well, I thought I did take care of it.  Bill, what did you do?  What did you do, Bill?  Well, I really liked going to his island so much and I just couldn't do it.  Are you mad?  Bill, I'm going to delete you like my e-mails!  I love it here!  Y'all need to leave my sister alone.  She's a good, honest judge.  She ain't do nothing wrong.  Decisions, decisions.  We're going to need at least $10 million to figure this one out.  For just $1.64 a day, you can sponsor an American.  You know, this damage is going to cost at least $2,000.  That's right.  But who's going to pay for this?  I have an emergency.  I need help now.  Okay, everyone, I need you to take a deep breath.  I'm sending over my thoughts and prayers.  What the hell is thoughts and prayers going to do?  Why would anyone want to do this to my house?  I wish.  Settle down.  This is an emergency.  My house is destroyed.  I deserve this.  Send the police now.  Give me a C. C. Give me a... I don't know what I'm talking about.  Four more years coming right up.  Thanks, Constitution.  For the price of a pack of gum, you too can sponsor an American.  Listen to me, okay?  I am House Drinker Nancy Pelosi.  I need you to send the police right now.  I am a U.S.  Senator.  I'm kind of a big deal.  Don't you guys have, like, a private security team or, like, whatever?  Yes, but this is a police issue, okay?  And I'm rich, all right?  Rich people don't deserve this kind of treatment.  Send the police now!  I can send, like, a social worker or, like, a counselor.  What's your favorite color?  Do you like giraffes?  Hey, ah, ah, ah!  I'm going to ask y'all a serious, serious question.  If me and Kama were your pilots, would you fly in our plane?  All aboard.  I'm still a senator.  Hey, Joe, you're sleeping with your eyes open. ",
