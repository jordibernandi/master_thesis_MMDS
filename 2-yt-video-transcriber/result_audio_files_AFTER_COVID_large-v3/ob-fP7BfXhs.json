That doesn't mean that you're not racist, sir.  Just because you have one black friend or a black wife, you can still be racist.  It has nothing to do with your acquaintances.  Wow, I must have been so intimidating with all the police views that day.  That's impressive.  Just a little dry.  I don't think so.  You're trying to have a conversation.  You have a one-track mind.  There's no point in having a conversation.  You have to be able to be open for both sides of the story.  You're putting your issues aside.  That's impressive.  They couldn't even handle it.  They couldn't handle it, sir.  I wasn't talking to you, sir.  I was talking to Wendy.  Oh, because I can't be racist, right?  No, sir, I was talking to him.

I'm inherently a racist.  You just called him a liar saying you don't have a black wife and black children.  You called him a liar?  You're young.  You're just not getting through to me.  How dare you?  How dare you ask for his man's family?  How dare you make a personal call?  You don't know nothing about him.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  injustice and hate and anger and violence come from.  It's not about racism.  You can be racist with a black wife.  Absolutely.  You understand me?  Absolutely, sir.  Read the Bible.  Read the Bible.  Read the Bible.  It's not about who you know is what you do.  How you act.  Nah, we were at first.  Read the Bible.  That's real.  John 3.16.  That's real.  Some man came over to look at my pencil, and that's what started it all.  I didn't look for you all.  He didn't look at your pencil.  He was looking at your drawer.  No, he didn't need to come up to me.  He didn't need to come up to me.  thing that could have happened.  He was complimenting you on your drugs.  What did you do?  I don't have a weapon.  I didn't want him coming up to me.  I didn't want him coming up to me.  I just wanted to draw.  I didn't start this.  Don't come up to people.  Just stay on your ground.  You lost your argument.  You're mad.  I'm glad everyone's moving now.  I'm glad you're all moving out of the way. ",
