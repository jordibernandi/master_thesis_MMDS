            "text": "Hi folks, I'm Steve Hindy for Showing Animals Respect and Kindness.  In January 2020, we sent the shark investigator to the National Western Stock Show and Rodeo in Denver, Colorado.  Let me show you a little of what the investigator found.  This is Kirsten Vold, the owner of Vold Rodeo.  Although she's a woman operating in a male-dominated industry, Kirsten Vold has demonstrated that she can be just as cruel and underhanded as even the sleaziest fake cowboy.  Watch carefully and you'll see Kirsten Vold stabbing horses with what is apparently a sharp object.  It has to be pretty sharp, because otherwise we would see it.  It's impossible to tell exactly what it is.  It could be as simple as a piece of stiff, sharp wire.  This is something we've seen before.  Whatever the stabbing device is, it makes these horses act wild.  That's what rodeo is all about, making tame, domesticated animals respond to pain and fear.  Kirsten Vold's usual weapon of choice is an electric prod called a hotshot.  The hotshot delivers thousands of volts of painful static electricity.  Here is Kirsten using a hotshot at the 2019 College Rodeo Finals in Casper, Wyoming.  The manufacturer of the electric prod has stated for decades that its products are intended for livestock operations and that they are not to be used in rodeos.  The hot shot is designed for hogs and cattle, as indicated on the packaging.  The manufacturer has stated that the prod should never, under any circumstance, be used on horses.  Clearly, none of that matters to Kirsten Bold or any other rodeo thugs.  Maybe Kirsten used her spike device because we've already exposed her for using the hot shot.  God only knows what she'll resort to next.  We've seen rodeo thugs literally stick wires in horses' genitals to make them act wild.  Incredibly, on the website for Bold Rodeo Company, you'll see this comment from Ms.  Bold. ",

            "text": "This isn't love, Kirsten.  This is abuse.  Not surprisingly, Kirsten Vold is a member of the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Hall of Fame.  In rodeo, the more cruel you are, the more famous you become.  Kirsten Vold won't be fined or suspended or disciplined by the PRCA for her abuse of horses.  Practically anything these phony cowboy thugs do to farm animals to make them act wild from pain and fear is considered acceptable by the rodeo industry.  Rodeo isn't a sport.  It is organized animal abuse.  A truthful, honorable society would declare rodeos to be a criminal enterprise, just like cockfighting, dogfighting, and bullfighting.  If you care about animals, please do not attend rodeos.  And please do not do business with rodeo's unethical corporate sponsors, including Coca-Cola, Best Buy, and Discount Tires.  I'm Steve Hindy for Showing Animals Respect and Kindness. ",
