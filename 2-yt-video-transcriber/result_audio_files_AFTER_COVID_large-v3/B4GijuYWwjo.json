            "text": "So speaking of scandals, Judicial Watch is, again, front and center on a scandal that everyone ought to be interested in.  I think most Americans are interested in, but no one's doing anything about, which is the Biden Burisma Ukraine China influence peddling scandal.  You remember Joe Biden.  He's running for president.  Well, his son had gotten a sweetheart deal.  Obviously a no-show type job from Burisma in the Ukraine.  It was their insurance policy to protect them from corruption investigations.  Certainly they paid off.  when Biden went in there and threatened, got a prosecutor fired by threatening withhold a billion dollars in aid.  And then of course, you had the Chinese give A special concession to Hunter Biden's business worth potentially, I think, $1.5 billion in business.  It's not clear how much money directly went into Hunter's pockets.  Business that was effectuated during at least one visit to China, an official visit to China with Joe Biden that Hunter happened to be on the plane with him on, Air Force Two.  So we had noticed that members of Congress had asked about Biden's travels, specifically Senators Johnson and Chuck Grassley.  And so we said, we want those records, too.  Give them to us.  So, you know, sometimes that's what we do.  You know, Congress, everyone thinks, well, Judicial Watch, according to Congress, doesn't tell us jack.  They don't tell us jack about what they're doing.  And we often find out about what Congress is doing because we see the letter somewhere.  Say, well, look at what they're asking for.  They must have some information.  We'll ask for that, too, because unlike Congress, when we get the information, we disclose it to the public.  Congress doesn't always do that.  So in this case, we saw that they were asking for Secret Service records about Hunter Biden's travels.  Where else was he going?  Was he on Air Force Two?  Was he on Air Force One?  Were there government planes?  Now, the Secret Service responded.  to the senators, but the senators didn't release the information.  But because we had FOIAed it, they sent their response to us.  And we found that Biden was provided, Hunter Biden was provided Secret Service protection on 411 flights, 29 countries he visited, including five visits to China.  And so this means the Secret Service was providing him coverage.  and which security, which is appropriate.  I think it's appropriate.  It's the vice president's son.  President Biden was vice president at the time, obviously.  So they provided, they usually provide the children of the president and vice president secret service protection.  Now, it doesn't say, the documents don't say whether he was on government planes here.  The Secret Service told the senators to go ask other agencies, which we'll do as well.  Five visits to China.  You know what's not in these documents?  Any visits to Ukraine.  And by the way, this is only a portion of the Trump Obama administration's Hunter Biden travel, meaning it was like the first five years, not the full eight years.  So he's hired in April of 2014.  We get the records from the beginning of the Obama administration through May of 2014.  And there are no at least Secret Service connected visits to Ukraine.  Now, isn't it amazing that you're able to get a job in Ukraine for a major national conglomerate?  Without having to visit the country.  Or at least not having visited it within the last five years prior to getting hired.  I guess it's possible.  But it certainly raises additional questions about the circumstances of the hiring.  Don't you think?  Don't you think?  So I'm sure other reporters are going to be looking at these documents.  The visits included Ethiopia, India, Argentina, France, Spain, Canada, Dominican Republic, China, Belgium, Spain, United Kingdom, Egypt, South Africa, Denmark, Hong Kong, Mexico, France, Colombia, Russia, Russia.  Ireland, China again, Switzerland, Italy, Japan, I guess I'm repeating myself some of these, and Qatar.  So this is just, we didn't even have to sue for these documents, so this was a nice one, because we got the documents.  So he compiled them for the senators and we asked for them and we got the information that the senators didn't release, but we're releasing them to you, the American people, Because we think you have the right to know about this stuff as timely as we can make it available to you.  Now, we have multiple lawsuits on Biden.  Hunter Biden.  I think there are seven lawsuits now that Judicial Watch has pursuing in federal court.  The State Department has essentially shut down its FOIA operations, so we're not getting much out of them.  And so the coronavirus is benefiting Joe Biden.  At my view, there's no reason to shut down the FOIA operation.  I complained about it.  Nothing's been done.  The FBI largely shut down its FOIA operation, although they started getting it back up again.  So the real question is, is why is the State Department stalling the release of documents?  Because they've had these documents for months.  They know what we're asking for.  You can bet they've been gathered and they're ready to go.  They're just sitting on them.  They're just sitting on them.  But the Burisma scandal ain't going away.  The Hunter Biden scandal ain't going away.  Those influence peddling scandals aren't going away.  And now we know Biden's involvement with the Russia gate and Obama gate and the Flynn targeting and the Trump targeting, it's a whole other raft of scandals that Biden needs to be held accountable for.
