            "text": "America is under attack.  Reverend, you say we still need God's help.  No question.  Our country is still in great trouble.  A humanistic, atheistic agenda.  God-haters, slanderers, and they're senseless, faithless, heartless.  The government now is impinging on the religious freedoms.  The forces of secularism are extremely aggressive.  Well, apparently the god they worship is the pagan god of the Old Testament, Moloch, who allowed for child sacrifice.  It's a war on traditional family values.  Today, the left coast is probably the most inhospitable place for free and unfettered speech in the country.  The Supreme Court's decision means gay rights now trump religious liberty.  Donald Trump in January 2016 promising to win the war on Christmas.  When was the last time you saw Merry Christmas?  You don't see it anymore.  They want to be politically correct.  Atheists versus a Christian nation.  Isn't this a Judeo-Christian country?  Founded on Judeo-Christian values and principles.  We must respect the rights that our Creator gave us.  Yes, the Second Amendment's right to keep and bear arms.  I used to think just like this.  Right-wing media told me how to feel about myself, about my country, and the world.  Stand for our God, our freedom.  and our families.  In that world I was terrified of secular humanists.  Today, I am a secular humanist.  Take a journey with me into Christian nationalism, right-wing radio, God and guns, crime and punishment, the bloody Bible, and the myth of traditional American values.  I'm Seth Andrews.  I'm a former Fox News Christian.  And these are my confessions.  The new book Confessions of a Former Fox News Christian is available now in paperback and hardcover.
