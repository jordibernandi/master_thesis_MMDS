            "text": "so man i i laid in the bed i was getting ready to go to sleep and i saw this pop up on the news.  it was just announced and i said man we've been talking about this for years now and i've said this over and over and over again all the things that you know whether you want to say conspiracy theories people been talking about for years the Left Behind books with the Mark of the Beast, all of these different things that many years ago when I was a child, we talked about, and it was just like, it was like something that was just so far off in the future, and people didn't really take it serious, and right now, when you look at what's going on in the world, man, I just feel this strong, like, ah, church, I feel like we got to pray.  And it's not that I'm scared or afraid, but listen to this now.  If you remember, if you look up the video that I did a week ago on YouTube, I said, what if they tricked you into thinking that the coronavirus was no big deal?  And I'm not a conspiracy theory kind of person, but I've seen people talking about that.  it's man-made and you saw the doctor talking about where it came from.  It's right next to the big vaccination research facility in Wuhan and all that kind of stuff.  Listen to this.  New coronavirus stimulus bill in Congress creates U.S.  digital dollar.  Now, this is not being reported by some fake internet news.  This is from Forbes.  I'm pretty sure we can find it in other places.  It says... Now, this is where it gets interesting.  You know, I like to think, right?  Some people think the virus is man-made and it was created, and it was created to crash the economy.  Remember I said, what was it, a week ago, I said, wouldn't it be interesting if they use the coronavirus as a way to move into the digital money, you know, and do away with currency?  because they say, oh, the coronavirus is spreading through the cash, so now we have a reason to to do away with cash and make everything digital.  And if they make everything digital, it's so easy to turn off your money.  Say you don't comply, say you don't get the vaccination, say you don't take the mark.  Now we can just turn your money off digitally because you can't stack up a bunch of cash or something in your mattress, right?  And go pay because cash will be nothing.  So it gives them more control.  Now check this out.  As the market continues to drop and the U.S.  looks to Congress for agreement on a massive stimulus package to save the economy from impacts of the coronavirus pandemic, the newest offer by who?  House Democrats includes a very forward-looking kind of stimulus, the creation of a digital dollar and the establishment of a digital dollar wallet.  and what will send shockwaves through the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry, particularly for those following central bank digital currencies around the world.  This signals the U.S.  is in serious establishing infrastructures for a central bank digital currency.  Now, If you've been paying attention to the stuff that I've been talking about for the last five years, what did I say?  I said, the Lord told me that the persecution of the church is going to come through the Democratic Party through the legislation that they pass.  And I can get into deep into that.  Maybe I'll do that later.  Also, the article that I seen right after this, it was about this whole, let me pull it up.  Gender conspiracy.  This is Yahoo liberal news Democrats and it's talking about how the church has this conspiracy Right that the LGBTQ.  All right is coming against him.  I posted a new page Reading man, the Bible says my people are destroyed for a lack of knowledge.  It says be not ignorant to Satan's devices.  So it says gender identity cannot be fluid according to the Catholic Church.  and then it goes on pretty much saying that the church thinks that Like, oh, the LGBTQ is after us.  And of course, they're using fancy language that you can read through, okay?  And you can see for yourself.  They're already trying to make it that you know we're crazy in the church and that we think that lgbtq is after us.  right.  so i shared that article.  you can research it you can read it for yourself.  i always tell you guys don't take my word for it go study.  i want to get back to this thing with the digital dollar right because we said this a couple weeks ago.  we said what if?  just say because they they have been trying to manipulate the weather?  right men like to play god.  you see the stem cell research and they're trying to put um you know, have men be pregnant.  They've got all these different things that they're doing in science, trying to play God.  Then you see NASA, they have a weather machine trying to manipulate the weather.  And I've told you guys for years, it always reminds me of the Tower of Babel.  People, they're going to build so high, and then God is going to say, enough is enough.  Boom, I'm done.  You're trying to exalt yourself too high.  You're trying to make yourself gods.  And so, Not only this, right?  I told you guys the other day about the book that I've been writing for about a year.  And the book is called End Worlds.  And I'm not about to try to promote the book to you or nothing.  Just listen.  What I wrote in the book, I felt that God wanted me to write it.  And it was pretty much a series of events that happened in the world.  And there was a virus.  There was wars.  There was rumors of wars.  There was just tension between countries.  There was political turmoil.  And when all these different things happen, it got so bad that the world decided to come together and they met at the U.N.  And the U.N.  decided that we didn't need individual governments anymore.  And they broke the world down into zones and they created a one world government.  And they did away with, you know, dollars and euros.  And it was all digital, digital money.  Right.  And so I said all that to say this in the book, I called it the Alliance, the Global Unity Alliance.  Somebody sent me a link the other day from Bill Gates and it's called the 2020 ID.  And it was Bill Gates, Microsoft, the vaccination people, the ones who do the study and the research.  And they're trying to come up with this digital digital ID, which pretty much has all your information.  Right.  So people are very quick to say, well, it's not the mark of the beast.  What's the problem?  I posed the question last night, right?  Two questions.  The church is shut down because we obey the government, right?  And it's kind of like they're testing the waters.  What happens when they say, hey, if you don't adhere to the LGBTQ agenda, if you don't take this vaccination that we've created, you know what I'm saying, then you're not allowed to shop anymore.  If you don't take this digital ID, if you don't take this injection, if you don't take this chip, then you can't buy groceries anymore.  I believe that the Lord is allowing this as a warm up.  And I've told you this many times before.  You can wish Donald Trump out of the office.  The Lord told me specifically that Donald Trump is a wall that is holding something back in the spirit.  And people have been laughing and they've been mocking.  New Corona stimulus bill in Congress creates the U.S.  digital dollar.  And if you know anything about this world, everybody looks to the U.S.  Everybody watches the US.  They watch what we do because we're a melting pot.  And so then when I looked at the thing, not only did Bill Gates, are they working on this thing called the digital ID in 2020?  I think it was in 2013.  You can look up a TED talk.  He was saying that the biggest threat to the world right now is a new virus.  And this was six, seven years ago.  He said, we're not ready for a new virus and it could be really bad.  And so I'm not saying that Men have created this virus.  But it also wouldn't surprise me if they did.  The thing is that I know that God is in control.  The thing is that I know the Bible says that these things would happen.  Right.  Second, Timothy three.  This know also that in the last days, perilous times shall come.  This is what the Bible says, right?  Now, the thing is, I think that we've heard that stuff for so many years, and people have said Jesus is returning for so many years, and people have been talking about the end times and the last days for so long that we've got complacent, but we haven't really sat and thought about how could this stuff come to pass?  Because you understand that United States, we're politically correct, and I've continually said this for the last five to six years.  Persecution in America is not going to come like in China and other places.  They're not going to start cutting Christians hands off and everything.  Why?  Because the foundation that America was built on, the way to persecution is going to come is through legislation and laws.  Do this or this, this, this is going to happen.  And I'm not going to take credit for saying this, but Pastor Jermaine, and we're going to talk about it a little bit more on Wednesday.  He said something to me about eminent domain.  And some of you who are in real estate know that.  So a lot of these pastors, if they don't submit, their land could get taken very quickly.  The government like, hey, we need your land because we want to build a highway here.  Right.  So there's a lot of ways for the pressure to come on the church.  Now.  I'm not saying this for you to be scared or be afraid because I believe that God is always in control.  He always makes a way of escape.  He will give us the grace that we need, the wisdom that we need to overcome.  But this is something to think about.  Don't just be living in La La Land like, oh, you know, I'm not worried about it.  What if they come out with this vaccination and they say, hey, you got to take it or you can't go to Walmart and buy?  no groceries no more.  What are you going to do?  I'm going to tell you what my opinion is.  For me, I'm not saying this is what God told me to tell you guys.  I'm saying what between me and God, I'm not going to take it.  Because in the Bible times, they lived without, you know, people talk about wisdom and stuff.  In the Bible, they were living without vaccinations.  They were living for a lot longer than some of us were living without a lot of the stuff that we have today.  So for me personally, I'm just not going to take it and I'm going to put it in God's hands.  And I'm going to just, I'd rather die trusting God then, you know, out of fear doing something like that.  And that's just my, you know, the Bible says to work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.  I believe church that we've been too comfortable for too long.  And it's about time that you start thinking about this stuff.  You start praying about this stuff and then start realizing, you know what, man, I'm not going to be able to do it and make it on my own wisdom.  I'm going to need God to back me up.  I'm going to need God to intervene.  Now, I know some of you are coming in and out and you're like, man, okay, what is this guy talking about?  New coronavirus stimulus bill.  So the bill that the Democrats just blocked twice, they said that they want the bill to be passed, but this needs to be one of the conditions.  We want to create the digital dollar in America.  And all I was telling everyone was, I'm not saying that This virus was created just to introduce this.  But I do know that they're going to move in very politically correct ways with everything they do.  So be wise, be aware, and be in much prayer.  Don't be afraid.  Don't be scared.  But don't be ignorant.  Because if you walk around ignorant, then it's just so easy, you know what I'm saying, to just follow it up.  Well, that looks like a good idea.  I'm a vote for these people because you know, that's just what, what we do.  And let's be clear on this.  I've been asking the Lord for wisdom when it comes to talking about this pop political stuff, because people get in their feelings and I want you to hear what I'm saying.  I'm not saying that God is a Republican.  I'm not saying that God is a Democrat.  I'm not saying you're more Christian.  If you vote either one, what I've said time and time again, it's put it on the scales and see which one is pushing the antichrist agenda.  I know you might not like a certain individual, but I believe that God does that on purpose.  It says he uses the foolish things to confound the wise.  I believe he allows certain things to happen.  So you have to walk by the spirit.  So it isn't an easy decision.  So it isn't black and white.  So you have to pray.  So you have to observe and watch and put it on the scales and see.  Put it on the scales and ask God to open your eyes because there's definitely something.  I end the video with this.  I've been saying it every video the last couple of times.  The Lord told me that when the temperature increases, so would the spiritual activity.  And that was a couple of weeks ago since I've been saying that.  Now, on a good note, you look across the world.  I don't know if you guys seen the video in Brazil where the people were worshiping.  Right.  All together from their balconies and people in Spain and all over the world.  These people are worshiping, calling out to God.  God has allowed all this stuff to happen to give us a wake up call.  All right.  He's allowing all this stuff to happen to give us a wake up call.  People have been straddling the fence.  People have been lukewarm with their Christianity.  People have been very carnal with their Christianity.  And the Lord is he's he's.  some people still haven't got it yet because they're still like, oh, it's no big deal.  You know, it's not a big deal.  But the Lord is allowing it to be where people's eyes have no choice to be open.  And they're like, man, you know what?  I need God.  I fully I fully need to depend on him for every decision.  From here on out, the way that I vote, the places I go, the churches.  Check this out.  God is allowing this to happen because a lot of churches are getting exposed right now.  A lot of churches have not wanted to talk about this stuff behind the pulpit.  You've been going there every Sunday and they've been feeding you a little motivational speech.  And now the people are not equipped for what is happening.  Many of you are going to go back to these gummy bear churches And they say, Pastor, what if they want us to take this vaccination?  What we should do?  And the pastor's going to look at you, I don't know.  But keep believing God for a new car.  So what I challenge you to do, and I tell you guys this all the time, my brothers and sisters, don't take my word for it.  Pray, study, seek God for yourself.  Some of you might be wondering why I got the hoodie on.  My hair is just super ridiculous right now, okay?  But new coronavirus, that's the key thing.  It's not like they just announced, oh, we're going to go with a digital dollar.  They're saying, in order for us to pass this bill so these Americans can get their checks, we want the digital dollar to be created.  So like I said, I'm not a conspiracy kind of guy, but I do believe there is corruption.  I do believe the Bible says the spirit of the Antichrist is running rampant through the earth.  You guys have heard me say that many times.  And I do believe that people who have no conscience of God, people who don't seek God, they're wide open for the Antichrist to use them like puppets for them to just flow and build the stage.  And so, yes, I don't believe in conspiracy theories, but I could see, I could see how someone made this virus, right?  Because we're doing stem cell research and we're trying to make men pregnant and they're doing all this stuff with science.  And people are like, oh, science is good.  Science is good, right?  But then they try to play God.  Some people are saying it's population control.  But look at how it's happening.  It's like, oh, there's this virus.  Oh, let's shut down the churches.  Shut down the churches, right?  That's wisdom.  But you still got all these people running around in the grocery store.  Think about this for a second.  And I'm not coming against the pastors who shut down churches.  My whole point with that was don't shut it down based off fear.  If the government mandates it and the Lord doesn't tell you to go against it, then submit.  Now, if the Lord tells you to go against it and fight back, that's a whole different thing.  But think about this for a second.  Oh, we can't have church, but the grocery stores are full, right?  We can't have church, but you go to all these places and it's still packed.  So that's just something that's a little bit funny to me.  The people that are handling the food, the restaurants, all these places still operating, but we can't go to church.  And then they say, shut down, lock down.  Then they say, oh, the National Guard.  We're activating the National Guard in California.  And we're implementing a curfew here in New York.  And oh, yeah, by the way, the digital dollar.  Literally everything that we've been talking about for the last six years, it's like they're dipping their toe in the water to test.  Let's see how they're going to respond.  Let's see how they're going to respond if we tell them we got to lock them down.  Let's see how they're going to respond if we tell them no gatherings more than 10.  Let's see how they're going to respond if we say that we're going to put some, we're not going to call it martial law, but we're going to bring the National Guard in and we're going to put in a curfew.  Let's see how they're going to respond.  Are they going to go easily?  Are they going to resist?  Are they going to keep going to the beat?  And so it's almost like it's a big test right now with the spirit of the Antichrist and the world, but also with the Lord.  And he's saying, man, I'm watching.  How are the people going to respond?  Something to think about, guys.  Love you.  Be blessed.  Be encouraged.  Have a wonderful evening in Jesus' name. ",
