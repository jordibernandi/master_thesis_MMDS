He's a really an independent thinker, a great writer.  His books are on Amazon on his website of twominds.com.  And he's here to discuss, obviously, the coronavirus, supply chains, markets, bonds, Trump's three-year election, precious metals.  And I think this is one of the best interviews for everyone to listen to right now because this is very data-driven and not based on any emotion or bias.  This is all facts.  And I love the way that he analyzes markets.  Charles, thank you for joining us. ",

            "text": "I want to ask you, first, let's start with coronavirus.  Why can't the origin be traced?  That's question A. Because I've heard several stories about this, and we've seen denials from China that it started in their fish market, et cetera, in the Huawei district.  Why is it so disruptive to the global supply chains?  Are they that fragile?  Or is this just not properly handled?  And C, do you believe that quarantining like 400 million people in China was the way to go? ",

            "text": "Great questions.  And in terms of the origin, I of course have to start by stipulating that I'm not an expert in genetics.  And so I just have a layman's understanding and interest in it, like most of us.  I believe that the viruses, as a general rule, and coronaviruses are also like this, they mutate very rapidly, right?  That's partly why they're so dangerous is they mutate very easily.  They're unstable.  And so the Chinese authorities and also scientists in the West have sequenced the genome of this coronavirus.  in a number of timeframes, right?  The earliest samples are, of course, in China, and then the later samples are present in the West.  And so they're trying to compare the rate of mutation, like the mutation drift, and they're trying to figure out how much of it is related to the SARS virus.  And apparently, from what I've read, it's almost an 80% match.  So, and other people have gone astray by looking at little snippets of the genome and they're saying, wow, this looks like HIV virus.  But, you know, viruses like all of life, you know, they use bits and pieces that are very similar to other viruses.  And so, It's, um, it turns out it's, I think it's fairly tricky to, to identify exactly where this came from.  And so that's, that's an ongoing thing in terms of the, why it's so dangerous, um, or why to the supply chain.  Um, yes, the supply chains, um, were, have been optimized for perfection.  And, and, um, if, if you know people who, um, are in the corporate, global corporate supply chain, they'll explain that there's like four layers deep here.  The supply chain isn't just the finished product, of course, there's all the components which could be circuit boards and which have components within the circuit board.  And so it's like you go down each layer, there can be a disruption that then disrupts the supply chain, you know, four layers deep, three layers deep, two layers deep to the final product.  And because the competition, at least within China and the global supply chain, has been quite intense, intense, then there's been this huge push to get rid of redundancy, second sources, and everything, and to limit the cost of keeping inventory, so-called just-in-time delivery and inventory.  So all of those management methods to optimize profits by reducing costs they come at a cost which is now only becoming visible, which is you get rid of redundancy, you get rid of inventory, you get rid of alternative sources for critical elements of your supply chain.  Well, then you realize now the whole thing's disrupted because you got rid of all those costs, but those costs had benefits.  And so now there's this huge scramble, right?  Of course, the most dangerous part of a supply chain is if there's only one source, right?  One unique source for various components.  or that source is overwhelmed, right?  That there were five sources, four are closed.  There's only one left.  They're running 24 seven.  They can only supply 20% of the component globally.  So those are the kinds of snafus and difficulties that are arising.  And, um, on top of that, as, as many of us have been predicting for quite a while because of the trade war, uh, the global supply chain is, is trying to, um, get out of being dependent on Chinese supply sources.  And so this is now accelerating that desire for global corporations to find some other source outside China.  In terms of your last question, the quarantine, a lot of my friends who don't follow it quite as closely as I do are surprised by this because they look at the so-called official deaths in China, which are 20, 2,500 or something rather small.  And they wonder, well, why did the Chinese react so dramatically here, like quarantining 400 million people, shutting down most of their economy?  Well, I think we can kind of infer, just as a matter of logic, that the Chinese authorities made these decisions based on facts that were known to them but are not known to the rest of the world.  In other words, this was much more lethal than they're letting on.  It's much more disruptive.  And so they felt, it seemed to me, we can conclude they felt that this massive all-out quarantine to save their industrial coastal cities was their only option. ",

            "text": "Yeah, it's kind of hard to judge with the partial information that we have.  And obviously, now that this is in 50 some countries, many of them first world will have much more information that will be properly disclosed.  Because obviously, when you're running a country with 1.4, 1.5 billion people, you don't want to start a panic if you don't have to.  And you want to drip information to keep people safe and healthy, but you don't want to do anything that creates any sort of fear mongering, in my opinion.  Why did gold and silver rally hard, then sell off hard into the weekend?  I have my own opinion on it, but then... Today, as we're doing this interview, the gold's up like $50.  It's back to $16.50.  What is moving the metals up, obviously, on an uptrend, but then that big smash, and now again an uptrend? ",

            "text": "Right.  Well, as everybody that follows the precious metals markets knows, they're prone to these huge sell-offs.  And many people have assembled evidence that this is, you know... intervention from authorities who, who don't want that signal to go out to the public that, um, the signal being gold and silver soaring, um, that would, um, be viewed as a signal.  that, um, things are not, uh, right with the world and you better, uh, start selling your, your stocks and bonds and get into, uh, precious metals or equivalent, uh, safe havens.  Right.  Um, so, um, That's one element in there.  The only non-intervention element I can think of is that people get panicky and they want to sell everything and they just want to be in cash.  And we might see that going forward, that all asset classes may get these massive sell-offs as people panic and just want to liquidate and just get in cash because they no longer trust anything. ",

            "text": "I understand, Charles.  And obviously, we've seen many, over the years, many instances where these situations have occurred.  And if you remember, in 2008, these metals sold off real big, right towards the end of the panic.  They really sold off.  Silver went from $21 an ounce to around $9 an ounce when Lehman went down.  So this could also signal that we're headed to sort of a reflation era, sort of like 2020 and 2011.  And with that in mind, You know, the 10-year treasury bond now yields about 1.06%, the lowest of all times.  The Fed just cut rates by 50 basis points on an emergency meeting, unscheduled.  This is the asset class that the rest of the asset universe is based on, the 10-year bond.  So what does that mean going forward for real estate and for the stock market? ",

            "text": "Well, that's a big question.  And again, I want to stipulate that I don't claim any expertise in all the complexities of the global bond market.  I'm just looking at it as a lay person.  as the largest asset class in the financial world, right?  I mean, real estate is also, you know, I think on the order of about $100 trillion market globally.  But in terms of like so-called liquid assets, financial assets, then the bond market is the 800-pound gorilla.  So we want to focus on that because what happens to bonds, of course, influences all the other asset classes just from its size.  And the fact that institutional players tend to be big players in the bond market because they need to tie up some sort of reliable income source, right?  insurance companies and that kind of institutional buyer.  So for the Fed to cut rates, obviously a move of, if not panic, then of desperation.  And around the world, we've seen a move over the last few years in Japan and Europe to negative rates, right?  Where it's actually costing you money to park your money in a bond.  That until... until the coronavirus, COVID-19 hit, that trend was reversing, that the move to negative interest rates was not accomplishing what central banks were hoping for, which was rapid growth and so on.  So it was actually hurting the banking sector and creating another source of fragility.  Instead of helping things, it's actually hurting things.  And so there was kind of a reduction of that move.  So now with the Fed lowering interest rates, we're getting back to a point where there's not much yield available globally at all.  And so that creates this interesting sort of feedback, which is if you're a global money manager and you want some sort of yield, well, then you're going to be drawn to the U.S.  dollar-based bonds because they're still providing a positive yield.  And so... You can say, well, gosh, if I buy a 30-year treasury bond, I'm still getting 1.6 or 1.5, whatever it is, percent.  And that's better than negative.  So we may see this in terms of safe havens.  We may see a permanent large flow into precious metals.  We might see that same kind of flow into dollar-denominated bonds simply because they're still paying a positive yield. ",
