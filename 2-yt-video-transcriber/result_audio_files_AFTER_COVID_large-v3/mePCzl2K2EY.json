            "text": "Shallow on call along.  how about your mouth shy by Hashem with cock with dosh.  double honors into the Apostles and the elders.  Salutations to all my fellow laborers doing this work in truth and sincerity Risking their lives and their freedom to do so now more so than ever.  To the scattered elect that are scattered around the four corners of the earth that be like unto the speckled bird the Israelite foreigners and to the aqua that are listening and learning to you.  I say shalom.  This is your brother, Malcolm, from the branch of the Great Millstone here in Chicago, coming at you with another lesson in truth.  And this is about lineage and heritage.  This video is inspired by the beloved brother, ICR, from the Carolina camp.  And he sent me this video, which I can't seem to find.  So I'm just going to play the video that you can hear it and then look at images that represent what she's talking about.  And in this video, there's an attractive girl who appears to be an Edomite.  And then she shows her brother and she shows her mother.  And then she shows her father.  Her father is a so-called Negro, clearly from the Southern Kingdom.  All right.  And I'm going to assume Judah.  He could be Benjamin or Levi, but but I kind of just from the images, I kind of get that Judah vibe.  And then I'm looking at groups and images of people that have either Edomite fathers and Jacob or Jacob as a father.  And often their children look as if they're so-called biracial children.  And sometimes their kids or their children look completely like one parent or the other.  Now this girl, she looks completely like she's Anita Mike.  Like she does not have a Negro father.  Like one of my clients, her daughter is the same way.  And I've spoken about her in many videos before, her daughter London.  And London is so beautiful.  is such a talent.  I've known this little girl since she was two years old.  Yeah, about two.  The little girl is 10 now.  And the girl can ice skate, water ski.  She does snowboarding and skiing.  I mean, she's just amazing at everything that she does.  And they marvel at it.  And you know why they marvel at it?  Because they don't get it.  Alright?  They don't get it because she's Jacob.  That's why she's able to do things.  I mean, when she was like six years old, she was.  She was too advanced for all the six years old and she was performing in the skate shows, the ice skating shows with all the 10, 11, and 12 year olds.  So you had this tiny little six year old out there with all these bigger kids doing everything that they were doing.  You know?  But let's get a scripture just to explain that.  Because you're going to have people talk about mamzer and all these other things.  A mamzer... As a matter of fact, let's give you an example of a mamzer.  I forget this... This celebrity's name and his wife.  She's also a celebrity, but this is their child.  All right.  Even though this boy has melanin.  I think this is Owen.  Oh, Dax Shepard.  All right.  And this may be a TV family.  Maybe not a real family.  I'm not sure if they're family for real.  If it was just in a TV show.  But if this were their offspring, which looked like it could, this was perfectly cast.  that would still make this melanated child an Edomite, okay?  Now, let's go to this United States census.  This census would be improper because what would they label this child?  All right, other.  What the hell is other?  The Lord didn't make any group of humanity called other.  That's confusion.  See, the Bible clearly says you are whatever your father is.  And this little girl is an attractive child, and she actually looks like both the parents.  I see both their faces in her face.  All right?  But just to clear up any confusion that might be there, let's get a scripture to clear up the matter.  This is Booker's Numbers 1 and 18, the go-to scripture.  And this lesson is more for the... Ooh, I hit 18 and one, so lock it.  One and 18.  And this is more for the newer people that are coming into the truth, that are coming into the knowledge.  In Numbers 1 and 18, and it reads, and they assembled all the congregation together on the first day of the second month, and they declared their pedigrees, all right, after their families by the house of their fathers.  according to the numbers and names from 20 years old and upward.  And by that poll, see, the people over in the land of Israel, the Israelis, the Jewish people within their religion, which is really not biblical at all, they claim their heritage through their mothers.  Well, that's not biblical.  And this is just one of many scriptures.  But it used the word pedigree.  So let's look that up in the English.  You know, I could go to the blue letter and Break it down.  But we're just gonna go to an English breakdown of the word pedigree.  All right, so it looked up there, pedigree.  Okay.  It's got two definitions.  Well, we're not going to worry about the one which is dealing with animals, but we're going to go with the number two.  It says, a recorded ancestry, especially upper class ancestry of a person.  Pedigree, ancestry, descent.  Lineage, all right?  Lineage, a descent from an ancestor or pedigree, a Dutch nobleman of ancient lineage.  See, from a man.  All right, descent.  All right, so your pedigree is through the male.  It's a patriotic, it's a patriotic thing.  Let's look up the word patriarch.  Oh, not that one.  There we go.  A male head of a family or tribe.  All right.  Any of those biblical figures regarded as fathers of the human race, especially Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and their forefathers or the sons of Jacob.  Oh, let me read that again.  Any of those biblical figures regarded as fathers of the human race, especially.  So it didn't matter if you were Japheth, if you were Ham, if you were Sham, if you were male, you were patriarch of your family.  But it says especially Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and their forefathers.  or the sons of Jacob, the 12 tribes, all right?  So looking at this confusion, people would say, well, I'm black and I'm white.  No, unless he happens to be one of those speckled birds, these children are Edomites.  And see, and Edom was so cruel and so wicked, they put their own children in slavery.  Often ones like this will become house servants, which would be these two little girls, so they will eventually become bed wenches.  Get sold, especially down in New Orleans.  You know, that was, in Louisiana, was famous for whore houses, and many of children and offspring that came out like this during the time of slavery, that's what they were used for, comfort girls.  All right?  This one, well, that's an Israelite.  Because that father, that's Jake all day.  Okay?  She looks like a woman that I know.  It looks like she could be Ephraimite that I know.  Who's trying to get at me?  for years too, by the way.  But you know, she had a man, so I avoided her.  But there you go again, back to them.  Okay, so let's go back to the whole page.  I think they might be famous.  She looks familiar.  But nevertheless.  These children.  Are his lineage.  So without any further ado.  Because those little kids could actually.  This is the perfect one.  Because those two children could actually pass.  At this point in their lives.  One for the fact this little.  This little one has a daddy's eyes.  You know.  He could get pulled over stop.  When he has those kids.  Because I've seen that happen.  a really dark man with a blonde baby or something in there, pulling him over, you know, telling him, what do you get that child for?  It's like, what are you talking about?  This is my child.  It's crazy, the hatred and the racism that Jake faces, the problems that it creates when you hook up with, if you hook up with Edom, or that it could possibly create, all right?  But let's find and play this video.  It's only a minute long, all right? ",

Because she has subscribed to the false narratives... that has been presented in Babylon to the whole world, this whole white-black thing, all right?  Because what I'm looking at is a brown man and a red woman.  She's different shades of red, kind of pinkish, and he's a light caramel brown, all right?  But people will call him black, and people will call her white.  And you have to understand that those are... social constructs that were created to elevate white superiority.  When you listen to the definition of white and you listen to the definition of black, they're completely opposite of each other.  White is everything that's pure and that is wonderful and that is decent.  And black is everything that is indecent, that is ugly, is nasty, is dirty, it's negative.  Then what's sad is that you will have Israelites who would try to defend blackness.  Oh, no, but black is beautiful.  Idiot, you're not black.  You're freaking brown, man.  It's like, can you not see that your skin is brown?  And did you not just read and hear the definition of black?  The amount and level of stupidity trying to hold on to black culture.  What is black culture brought you?  All right.  Adulterous music, murderous music.  and chitlins, pork, shrimp, and lobster, shrimp fries, fish fry, catfish fry, frog legs, hog maws, possum, coon, just all out.  wickedness, twerking in public places, all right?  Baby daddies and baby mamas.  That's black culture with Israelites.  just like these two children, doesn't matter what their mother is, all right, they're still Israelite, and then you're going to have some, oh, they're Mamzer, no, if it was, it was reverse, then they would be Mamzer, all right, a Mamzer is someone who has a heathen father and an Israelite mother, there are way too many examples of Israelite men, all right, even in the The holy lineage of David, Solomon, and Yahushua.  There are heathen mothers in that lineage.  So you're going to call the Lord a mamzer?  You're going to call King David a mamzer?  Solomon a mamzer?  These people are ridiculous.

So, this little girl grows up and she's filling out paperwork and she puts on there black or African American... They think it's some sick joke.  And then she puts white on there.  She feels like she's lying.  Because what?  You can't hide your father forever.  Eventually your father's going to pop up.  All right?  This I know because my mother came from a family like this.  Where all the siblings and all the people could pass for being white.  But they weren't.  All right.  Half the family decided to live their lives as white because they got to get better jobs, live in better neighborhoods and have that so-called white privilege here in America.  And the rest of the family, which my mother was a part of that part of the family, lived their lives as if they were so-called black and didn't get all that treatment.  All right.  That thing is real.  And my mother is just as much as a damn a Negro woman as Tyra Banks or Lauryn Hill.  She don't look like it, but her spirit, the sound of her voice, her actions, her rhythm.  Well, you know what?  Let's grab a quick scripture.  This is the book of Romans 8 and 16.  This lesson one, these are really supposed to be, should have been over with by now, but you know.  But this is Romans 8 and 16 and it reads, the spirit itself bear witness with our spirit that we are the children of power.  So you have to be able to spiritually discern spirits.  You just can't write someone off.  When they approach the line or approach the brothers.  Because they look a certain way.  I was watching an old video of the beloved brother of my lawyer.  And he was talking about Manny Pacquiao and calling him a goop.  And how he had just beat Shane Mosley and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  What he don't understand is that.  Pacquiao had the spirit of Israel.  That's why he was even able to beat Shane Mosley and many other.  Jake.  that he's that he's beaten in the ring because it literally takes Jake to beat Jake. ",
