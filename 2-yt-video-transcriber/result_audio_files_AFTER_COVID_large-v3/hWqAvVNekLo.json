We're coming for you.  And we're going to have a good time doing it.  He said we'll go into the Capitol.  And walk down to the Capitol.  And I'll be there with you.  And I'll be there with you.  Of course he wasn't there with you.  Aghast, we say they sent you on a coup that day.  MAGA.  Rioting for MAGA You're a sucker for QAnon.  That's the poison you've been chewing on.
