Einstein's MC squared or Euler's equation are very simple and small and relate fast.  very massive ideas together, you know, mass energy and the speed of light in Einstein's equation.  It's not obvious why the speed of light should be in there, but intuitively.  But some things that people think are beautiful are extremely complicated.  The standard model looks like a mess if you just see it on a piece of paper.  String theory is famously extremely hard mathematics.  So why is that beautiful? ",

Now, the beauty of a physical theory, or let's take Einstein's theory of general relativity, nobody's going to tell you that the math there is easy.  But it's extremely beautiful.  The beauty of something like that theory or even something more basic like Newton's laws of motion and his use of calculus to solve them.  It's hard to convey if you don't live in the world of math and theoretical physics.  But it's very real.  It's like the beauty of music.  So asking me why an equation is beautiful is a little bit like asking why a piece of music is beautiful.  If you've heard it and you've experienced it, you know that it's beautiful.

But once you have sort of learned your lessons, you've learned about quantum mechanics, relativity, and quantum field theory, when you learn the language in which the theory of the strong interactions is formulated, it's actually simple.  It's incredible that such simple equations can give birth to such great complexity.  Nuclear physics is incredibly complicated, but it's described by extremely simple equations. ",
