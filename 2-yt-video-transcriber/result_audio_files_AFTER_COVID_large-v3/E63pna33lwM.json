            "text": "Hello, faithful Catholic.  2020 is set to be a monumental year in the church and in the culture.  To help you confront these rapidly changing times, we at Church Militant have created the 2020 Catholic Voters Guide.  Voting is one of the most moral actions you can do, and therefore, you must consider that our Lord will judge this action.  This Voters Guide will not only equip you to vote with a rightly formed Catholic conscience, it will give you reasons which you can, in turn, share with your loved ones.  As the late Father John Hardin said, any Catholic who is not about the business of evangelization might never entertain a serious hope of the beatific vision.  Gone are the times when Catholics could just sit back and trust our leaders.  The Marxists have invaded the church, the media, the government, and every other cultural institution they could.  A clean sweep, in fact.  Because of that reality, we have named this voter's guide appropriately, Saving Civilization.  So please follow the link and play your part.  The future of our country and our church is at stake.  God love you. ",
