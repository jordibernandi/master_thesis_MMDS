            "text": "Okay YouTubers, this is the Angry Pepper.  So today's episode we're going to talk about more civil unrest on the way.  Now, everything is getting out of hand in a hurry.  For the obvious reasons that United States are letting babies take control of the country.  Meaning, they're giving into their ways.  So, They're tearing down all the Confederate statues.  I disagree with that immensely.  They are changing or, sorry, banning movies or stopping the playing of them.  They are taking off shows, cartoons, because of police depiction.  They're getting rid of I guess, mascots on food products because racial depictions.  Now, that being said, when you give in to the cries of babies, They're going to want more, right?  It's like giving a spoiled kid one thing, then the next, then the next.  And before you know it, he's out of control.  Before you know it, you have to give him a beating, a spanking, whatever you want to call it.  This is what's happening here in this country.  We're letting babies or children run this country.  Now, there's been an uptick in hangings.  which I'm sorta not buying.  And I'm not buying it because suicide is up.  Now, I don't know the particulars on all the cases.  From what I've read, they were just, these people were hanging from trees.  I think there's been three so far.  I'll give you the area and location of each hanging now.  So, I'm not buying that bullshit at all.  It's just insane how all of a sudden, hangings are popping up with this racial tension that's building.  It is one hell of a coincidence, if you ask me.  They are erasing history.  They're tearing down statues all over the country because they are giving in to children, good, bad, or indifferent.  Those statues of those men, they built this country.  Slaves built this country.  The Chinese helped build this country.  So, you want to put up more Chinese statues, more African American statues, so be it.  But taking down statues of southerners who helped build this country is erasing history.  And when you erase history, you are doomed to repeat it.  So that leads into racial divide.  Now, racial divide is becoming a big to-do.  I'm starting to see it firsthand with white people, if you will, who were neutral in this, and they're now speaking up and they're more vocal.  But they're vocal within reason.  And they're logical.  But that... because of Black Lives Matter, can be misconstrued as racist.  There goes the racial divide.  Because again, when you let children speak, and uneducated kids speak, they think everything's racist, they think everything's sexist, they think everything's homophobic.  Couldn't be further from the truth, right?  So, again, you let kids cry, these are the things they come up with.  Their solution is to label you racist, homophobic, misogynist, once you start giving them facts.  And once you hit them with facts, all of a sudden now, you know, you're those three things and more.  So in case you guys haven't figured it out, I'm walking home again.  Part of my workout, I lose more weight.  I'm getting too old to be 275 pounds.  Now I'm now 267, 268, so I'm coming down in weight, but... Once you get to a certain point, your body can't hold that weight anymore.  Anyway, more police shootings.  So we had the shooting in Atlanta.  That shooting, to me, was a righteous shooting.  The whole thing was on body cam, the whole thing was on the surveillance in the Wendy's, and civilians in the area, and it looked like a righteous shooting.  But instead, Because they're listening to fucking uneducated children, they fired a guy and they brought him up on murder charges because a guy was shot in the back.  The guy turned around to shoot a taser at them.  Of course you're going to get shot at the back.  In Atlanta, that taser specifically is a lethal weapon.  Hence, shooting the motherfucker.  Now, I have no sympathy for this dude.  Zero.  Everything was going according to plan.  When they put the cuffs on him, he flipped out, fought with the cops, punched them, beat them, stripped one of his taser, and he gets shot in the back.  And people are like, he shouldn't have died.  Fuck him.  Right?  Because he fought... grabbed the taser, he was probably trying to grab a gun, but grabbed the taser instead and tried to incapacitate the cop.  If he would have incapacitated the cop, he could have got the cop's gun and killed the cop.  This case, this very scenario, happened probably 10, 15 years ago, where the suspect grabbed the taser, tasered the cop, incapacitated him, grabbed the cop's gun, killed that cop and his partner.  Right?  So this has happened before.  That was a justified shooting.  But Black Lives Matter, the hacks that those guys are, said it wasn't.  And the asshole Mayor Helena and the DA agreed, fired him, and brought him up on charges.  With that, right before they brought him up on charges, They were rioting.  It was a small riot.  It was like a baby's riot.  They burned down the Wendy's where it happened.  because leave it to the black community to burn down their own shit.  And don't get me started on the whole black-on-black crime shit again, but yeah, okay?  So guys, the more civil unrest... is coming, and it might not be in the form of a big riot and looting like we saw here in New York or across America for that matter.  It's going to be micro-riots, micro-looting, little pockets of shit here and there, which is going to add to more division in this country.  Now, I am seeing a big uptick in black conservatives.  I think I'm starting to fall into that group, that category.  I really am.  I'm like, you know, I was a die-hard Democrat because I'm like, the Democratic Party can change as long as you get righteous people inside.  Hell, any party can change as long as you get righteous people inside, right?  The Republicans can get back on their shit.  Democrats can get back on their shit.  But the Democrats are not.  They're assholes.  Most politicians, if not all, are assholes.  That's a blanket statement, and I'm covering everyone, from the president down to the councilman of whatever city and state.  So every politician's an asshole, and a lot of politicians are in it for themselves.  They're in it for themselves and the money they make.  They're not in it for us.  But should we have to start a new party... it needs to happen.  Something needs to happen.  Because at some point, you can only eat the same box of cereal for so long until you want some other shit.  You want to try something else, see what that tastes like, what it looks like.  Right?  Same thing as these fucking politicians.  Enough already.  We need new leadership across the board.  Black Lives Matter is trying to get into the political arena, guys.  Do not fall for their bullshit.  They don't give a shit about black lives.  They can care fucking less.  All of a sudden now they're trying to push the whole black trans movement.  I'm not buying it.  I'm not buying any of this shit.  Why?  Because they're in it for fucking themselves.  They're in it for political gain.  They're looking to start their own political party.  Mark my words, Black Lives Matter will be a political party inside of five years.  And then this shit's really going to fucking hit the fan.  Antifa, they might try to become a political party if they start using their brains.  And I hope they do because that would be my personal mission to fuck with every last one of their members.  All right, guys, this is D'Angelo Pepper.  Thank you for watching.
