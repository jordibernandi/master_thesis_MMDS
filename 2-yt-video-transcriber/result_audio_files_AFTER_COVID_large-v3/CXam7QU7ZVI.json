But COVID-19 isn't like either H1N1 or the seasonal flu.  For one, it's far deadlier.  And the coronavirus also appears to spread more easily than H1N1 or the seasonal flu.  In fact, the U.S.  could need more than five times the number of hospital beds currently available if the virus infects 40 percent of American adults.  That's prompted calls for people to stay home to help slow the spread.  Trump also said that the Obama administration didn't test for H1N1. ",

On April 21, the CDC began working to develop a vaccine.  Clinical trials began in July.  On September 15th, the Food and Drug Administration approved four H1N1 flu vaccines.  And by December, 100 million doses were available.  A vaccine for COVID-19 is likely to take much longer because it's new and more complex than the flu. ",
