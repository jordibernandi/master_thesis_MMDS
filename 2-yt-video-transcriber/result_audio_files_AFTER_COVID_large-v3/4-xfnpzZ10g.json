Of course we would.  Of course we would.  We would probably receive the tithe.  Some guy said, well, I just won $30 million.  I'm going to tithe.  Well, since you were against gambling, I won't send it to your church.  That pastor might read his theology possibly.  I don't know.  But to say that it's a sin, I don't believe so.  I believe it falls under the whole Christian liberty piece.  I believe same thing like with alcohol and things like that.  I believe it falls under that same category.  I believe there's a lot of warnings to it.  A lot of people use the whole thing about lots and casting of lots.  that that's it.  And that's not what they weren't gambling.  when they did those things.  But I believe where it goes back to, we kind of made a joke about the whole love of money piece and things along that line, but that's where it goes back to.  Greed.  About greed and wanting money and things along that line.  That's where I think we have to look.  What's my motivation behind it?  Why am I doing it?  And then also stewardship.  Mm-hmm.  How well am I stewarding my money?  God calls us all to be faithful stewards.  So if somebody went out and bought a lottery ticket, I don't think they have to show up on Sunday morning and get down and weep before the Lord and say, Father, forgive me, I'm a sinner.  But at the same token, if that's becoming a drive to you and you're driven by that because you're trying to get more, then that's where we have to check motive when it comes to those things.  So that's my personal stance on gambling. ",
