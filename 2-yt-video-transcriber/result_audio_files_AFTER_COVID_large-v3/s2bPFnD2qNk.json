When you look at the clashes that we've seen between police and protesters, is there a way for police to handle what seemed, or at least Shimon is describing, an almost entirely peaceful protest until the police came in and blocked it without making it even more tense?  In other words, is it normal just to stop protesters from walking or not? ",

Police officers are taught to use only that force necessary to overcome resistance and or gain compliance.  And so understand that there's a segment of police officers out there who live for protests.  They want to engage.  They want to get involved in what, you know, I've heard referred to on LAPD as stick time because there's no use of force report that you have to create once you engage a protester in that way.  And so there are those who live for that on both sides, right?  There are antagonists on both sides. ",

It has nothing to do with Breonna Taylor.  This was about Officer Brett Hankinson firing rounds into the next door neighbor's apartment had nothing to do with the murder of Breonna Taylor.  Those officers, according to the attorney general, were justified in that use of force.  Now, I don't know how 16 shots fired by one is justified use of force when officers are taught to fire two shots in rapid succession and then reassess the threat.  But nonetheless, that was his story and he's sticking to it.  And I found it offensive that he would call out celebrities and alleged influencers because he too says he's a black man and somehow celebrities can't speak for Kentuckians, but as a black man, he can speak for us.  And so I understand He's skinfolk, not kinfolk.  He doesn't speak for me. ",

The city council must approve much of this.  And then let's not forget that there is no admission of wrongdoing.  And so, listen, if he didn't do anything wrong, I don't even know why Hankerson was fired in the first place.  They came up with this no-knock warrant.  You need a supervisor to sign off on it.  That should have already been in existence.  And so everything that they pretend to put forward really doesn't affect patrol officers, me, when I'm in uniform day to day in my patrol car.  It won't stop.  And we know that because we saw Derek Chauvin sit and have us watch him for eight minutes and 46 seconds on the neck of George Floyd and dared us to do anything about it. ",

They're saying that Breonna, her boyfriend, fired the first shot.  I don't know that that's true.  We know that they'll lie.  They have.  They said that they rendered aid.  They said that There were no cameras.  They said that they announced, and there's been evidence contrary to all of that.  And so now we're stuck with their version of events.
