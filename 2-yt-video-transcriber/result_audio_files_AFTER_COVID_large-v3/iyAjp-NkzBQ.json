            "text": "So I have this problem with Ion Fury.  Okay, I have two problems with Ion Fury, but while the second is far less important, I have more to say about it.  This is a throwback shooter made in the style and engine of Duke Nukem 3D and Shadow Warrior, and published by the same company.  And in true 90s fashion, it has a big-ass arsenal of weapons.  And they're all cool and creative and they feel good to use.  I like firing them and making robots go boom.  And I played it all the way through, which is odd because I've played the first half of The Far Superior Dusk twice now and fallen off it both times because despite being a much better game, it did not scratch the same itch, which makes me wonder what the itch even is.  But that's not what I want to talk about today.  What kept rattling around my skull as I worked through Ion Fury's campaign was, if I like all these weapons, why don't I like this combat?  Which led me to step back and consider the broader question, what makes a shooter arsenal good?  We're in a mini-renaissance of indie shooters that throw back to 90s design.  Some are very creative and experimental, taking the principles of the era to make stuff unlike anything the decade actually produced.  But the big four seem to be Dusk, Project Warlock, Ion Fury, and Amid Evil, each of which hew much closer to a specific old-school lineage.  Quake, Doom, Duke, and Hexen, respectively.  And can I just say, of the four, a medieval is the only one where firing a crossbow would be period-appropriate, yet it's the only one that doesn't have one?  That's not important.  I just needed to say it.  Anyway, one result of all this harkening back to the 90s is the comeback of the arsenal.  I've talked about this a bit before, but the first-person shooters had a few distinct phases.  All through the 90s, we had these big, sprawling maps with keycards, and then once Half-Life dropped, we started seeing more linear, directed, story-driven levels.  And for both of these phases, players could expect to accumulate an increasingly large and increasingly ridiculous spread of weapons.  But come the era of Halo and Call of Duty, the arsenal faded away and was replaced with the loadout.  In games with loadouts, players may still use a wide array of weapons, but can only carry two or three at a time.  now and again swapping one out for another to prepare for whatever task is ahead.  And there is an artfulness to this, to making sure most weapons pair well with most other weapons, just as there is an artfulness to making a broad and cohesive arsenal.  This video is not about which is better design, but the rise of the loadout is indicative of a larger trend, Loadouts meant designers were no longer responsible for keeping the combat balanced, regenerating health meant designers no longer placed medkits to determine when players recover HP, and skill trees put players in charge of tuning the gameplay.  It's a shift in ethos towards, when in doubt, make the player do it.  And for the most recent phase of shooter design, that was the dominant model.  But the loadout is starting to lose its stranglehold as well, and the new model is... actually, we don't seem to have a dominant model anymore.  Shooters just aren't as big as they used to be.  We don't have that one monolithic property whose design seeps into everything that follows.  AAA design is much more franchise-dependent now.  You've got Halo and Call of Duty still using loadouts, team shooters that take after fighting game design where your movement, weapons, and abilities all depend on the character you're playing, and Doom and Wolfenstein are going strong, doing the old-fashioned arsenal with modern twists.  It can be a bit of a bummer when a genre wanes in popularity and starts to fragment, but it leaves room for ideas new and old to share space with each other.  So, since they're back, let's talk about arsenals.  90s shooter design has been pretty thoroughly covered on YouTube.  Chris at Errant Signal and Mark at Game Maker's Toolkit have talked about how 90s shooters handle combat encounters, both through the lens of Doom.  the former looking at level design and ammo availability, and the latter looking at enemy design, and both owe much to the writings of Liz Ryerson, Robert Yang, and J.B.  Leberton, among others.  So to avoid overlapping with them too much, let's look at the weapons themselves.  What makes the arsenal worth bringing back, and what makes a given arsenal succeed or fail?  Let's take it from first principles.  The most distilled arsenal is probably found in Quake.  A mere eight weapons.  Axe, shotgun, other shotgun, nail gun, other nail gun, grenade launcher, rocket launcher, thunderbolt.  90s bread and butter.  Most games from the era had versions of these.  I'm going to divide each weapon into five major attributes.  This is not definitive, we can do more than five, we'll get to that, but for now, range, accuracy, rate of fire, ammo consumption, and damage output.  I'm also going to sift these eight into five categories.  Most shooters from the era would cover these archetypes.  Melee, a close-range weapon that doesn't cost any ammo.  Slow to fire, but doing high damage at medium close range, mediocre accuracy.  Longer range and better accuracy than the shotgun, can do sustained damage, but at the cost of burning through ammo.  Doing a lot of damage, but can only be used at longish range, lest they damage the player character.  and whatever a given game's version of the BFG is, usually something that does massive damage but either rarely sees ammo pickups or just eats through it like a beast.  Looking at them this way, you may note that each weapon comes with trade-offs.  A shotgun trades rate of fire for power, a machine gun trades ammo consumption for rate of fire, and the super variants amplify these trade-offs.  The double-barreled shotgun does more damage but fires even slower.  The super nail gun fires faster but consumes twice as much ammo.  I find a lot of games from this era.  I tend to use shotgun and machine gun as my defaults, hot-swapping between them because they complement each other.  The other weapons I take out situationally, when I need to do a lot of damage from a distance, or when I'm ammo-starved, or when I need to just really mess up a big boy.  Quake is actually so distilled that there's a few expected categories missing.  For instance, most games of this era would have a pistol, a weak and mostly unremarkable starter weapon that nevertheless has better range and ammo consumption than your shotgun-machine gun combo.  Quake fills this role by having an oddly accurate shotgun.  And by the Half-Life era, you could usually expect to have a sniper category, something that trades rate of fire for high damage at extremely long range.  Then there's an eighth category, and here's where things get interesting.  Trap.  Your tripwires, sticky bombs, and snarks.  And this is fun, because it breaks the rubric I just built, which I think is great.  I like design that's too interesting to be reduced to a formula.  Duke Nukem can plop down a pipe bomb, walk halfway across the stage, and detonate it.  How do I measure the range on that?  And I can time how fast Gordon Freeman throws down satchel charges, but does that tell you anything you need to know?  So, okay, we'll have to tag into our pseudoscientific bar graphs that some weapons have unique attributes.  In fact, one category is mostly based around them, and these can't be easily categorized.  And we could see that as my failure to come up with a decent methodology, but I say it opens up possibilities.  Because our rubric left a lot of stuff out.  The grenade that ricochets, or the scope that reduces your field view.  Maybe a complete system would just add ricochet and FOV to our list of attributes to keep things clean, but they would be irrelevant to most weapons.  So, no.  We're gonna keep it messy.  But we can get a little taxonomical.  We can wrestle unique attributes into at least a few general categories.  The ice gun that immobilizes, the flamethrower that burns, the rocket that jibs.  These are all unique effects on enemies.  The chaingun that slows you down or pushes you back, the voodoo doll that hurts you if there are no enemies around, these are unique effects on the player.  And the grenade that bounces off of walls, or the Tau Cannon that shoots right through them, these are unique effects on the environment.  That covers most of it, but there is one more.  Though it is only one piece of the puzzle, we can't deny, in this genre especially, the significance of aesthetics.  A game can have a shotgun tactically indistinct from dozens of shotguns that have come before, but if designers get the look and feel just right, it makes a difference.  And is wrapping an enemy in a bolo grenade and then manually detonating it that different from just having a rocket that explodes on impact?  Not really.  But also, yes.  Extremely yes.  So we've got eight-ish categories and five-ish attributes and a few types of unique effects.  I'm not saying this analysis is perfect, nor do I pretend it's static.  Now that reloading is a common mechanic, for instance, rate of fire and ammo consumption would have to factor things like clip size and reload speed.  I acknowledge this is a from-a-few-steps-back look at something that is, up close, ever-shifting.  But what does all this codification tell us?  Well, what it tells me is that a game's level and enemy design are going to present you with a certain spectrum of combat encounters, and ideally, each weapon in an arsenal will cover its own part, and collectively, they will cover all of it.  If any one weapon is too all-purpose, it will leave others redundant, but if the weapons are too specialized, it will leave gaps.  So over the years, designers have trial and errored their way into a handful of weapon types that are distinct but complementary, each one's strengths making up for the other's weaknesses.  Together, they cover most of what a shooter will throw at you.  So in assessing an arsenal you haven't played with before, I suppose the primary questions would be, how do these eight weapon types distinguish themselves from any other game's eight, and did they add anything?  Adding something is really hard, and is such a treat when someone pulls it off.  I find the best additions usually play off a game's higher level systems.  The way Half-Life's gravity gun plays off the physics engine, the way Bulletstorm's leash plays off the combo system, the way Titanfall's homing pistols let you shoot while platforming.  These let the game's various systems come together into what feels like a cohesive whole.  So, what's the deal with Ion Fury's arsenal?  Well, let's walk it through.  For melee, you've got an electrified billy club that stuns enemies, one-shots spiders, and can power up generators.  Pistol is pretty standard, but secondary fire can let you target multiple enemies to line up automatic headshots.  Really good for taking down these little flying buggers.  Your shotgun can fire six times before reloading, and each one feels thumpy and rude.  Machine guns include Uzis that burn enemies and can be dual wielded, and a chaingun that slows you down but can absolutely wreck shop.  For explosives, you've got bowling bombs that can be rolled along the ground and even charged to become homing bombs, a grenade launcher that can go pretty dang far and launch over chest-high cover, and a cluster puck that can be thrown, affixed to walls, or turned into a shrapnel grenade.  Finally, you have a bow that is highly accurate at a distance, can be charged to fire up to five shots in a spread, or overcharged to... They're all unique twists on their respective categories, and they feel great to use.  So this should be doing it for me, right?  Right?  Why aren't I having more fun?  Well, okay, for starters, there's redundancy.  While all unique in their own ways, tactically, the grenades, bowling bombs, and cluster pucks shake out to long-range explosive, mid-range explosive, close-range explosive.  I played the game a second time to capture footage and had the same problem as my first.  I kept forgetting I even had the pucks, because there's so rarely a scenario where a bowling bomb doesn't suffice.  And sure, you can stick them to walls, but like the tripwires in Duke Nukem 3D, it seems like a multiplayer mechanic more than anything.  The run-and-gun nature of the campaign isn't suited for laying down traps, and the AI isn't built for walking into them.  And with only nine weapons in the game, a third of your arsenal is just explosives.  But there are also gaps.  Defeated enemies drop ammo for whatever gun they're carrying, and the most common enemies carry dispersers or ion bows.  So you tend to be up to your breastplate in shotgun shells and bolts, but the weapons that consume ammo the fastest are the machine guns, for which you come across ammo far less often.  You can single-wield an Uzi to halve the ammo consumption, thereby giving up the thing that makes it fun to use, but even then, you can only use it in very short bursts.  This means rather than one of your defaults, the machine guns are situational weapons, like a rocket launcher or sniper rifle, used primarily when you need to clear out a room in a hurry or do sustained damage to a boss.  So instead of shotgun machine gun, your go-to combo is shotgun bow.  You also tend to be stocked up on pistol ammo because it depletes slowly, while so ammo-starved for everything else that these three might as well be a loadout.  And aside from the fact that all three of these weapons fire fairly slowly, that's a close-range weapon and two long-range weapons, and it leaves a big dead zone.  You often find yourself taking damage from middle-distance enemies too strong for your weak-ass pistol and too dangerous for your slow-ass bow, and just chuck-charging them till your shotgun becomes useful.  The bow is theoretically good for picking off far away enemies, but a single bolt is surprisingly weak.  You can load up multiple shots, but they come out in a spread, so that doesn't help with sniping.  And thanks to the headshot targeting, you're better off just using the pistol, and only end up sniping with the bow if an enemy's too far away to target.  And then you're just chipping away at them while ducking their perfect and far more lethal aim.  A charged bow does a lot of damage when used as a slow-to-fire close-range weapon, just like your shotgun.  And with the spread and ability to pierce multiple enemies, it can do work on a clustered group, just like your three different explosives.  And you can still have fun with this.  Taking out this dude with a charged bow, this dude with the disperser, and this dude with a pistol headshot is more dynamic than just hitting all three with a disperser.  There's no tactical reason to do so, but you can, with effort, make it fun.  But it kind of seems like putting the player in charge of whether the game is enjoyable.  And it's never fun enough that you wouldn't trade it in a heartbeat for another Machine Gun clip.  Now, look, this isn't a product review.  Don't avoid the game just because I said it has problems, though maybe avoid it because it's made by transphobes.  I'm not here to share my every petty complaint, like how most weapons have to be reloaded but the HUD doesn't tell you how far you are from needing to reload, and you swap between weapons so much it's really easy to lose track, so you'll regularly line up headshots with the pistol, fire one bullet, and then have to sprint away while your character automatically reloads.  Oh whoops, I did the thing!  My point is, I wouldn't be talking about this game if it didn't illustrate something interesting.  Looking at failure is often the best way to understand success, because there are many successes.  There are people right now making old school shooters that truly understand what made the 90s arsenal work, who were not even alive when those games came out, while the people who actually made them have lost track of it.  I think that's wonderful.  that the arsenal holds value even for people who don't have nostalgia for it, and that they're the ones teaching us, or at least reminding us, that guns that are good to shoot do not alone make a good shooter.  Some things I feel like don't die, you stupid dumb shit.  God damn it, it's a ghost! ",
