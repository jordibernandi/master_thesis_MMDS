            "text": "It is crucial to note how in their effort to historicize gender identities and render visible their constructed nature, the LGBT ideologists, as far as I know, maybe I'm wrong, I'm trying to follow what goes on there, ignore a little bit too much the fact which again I don't perceive it as a negative fact, but it's crucial to understand it, philosophically, ethically, and politically, of what I cannot but designate as what falsely appears as essentialist language.  I met many people who changed their sexual identity, mostly from masculine to feminine, although of course there are also changes in other directions.  And I was so surprised how almost with all of them, The language they used to account for their experience was what?  In deconstructionist jargon that I don't share, they called essentialism, essentialist language.  For example, people repeatedly tell me of this liberating effect, like a boy who became a girl told me, finally I have a body into which I should have been born.  Now, are you aware how this runs against the usual?  deconstructive transgender ideology, which is, I say this with all my respect for her, personal respect, Judith Butlerian historicism.  We don't have any essential fixed identities, every gender identity is the result of performative practices, we reconstruct them, we playfully playfully change them all the time and so on and so on and I love this paradox.  all of a sudden we get at least in what they say and I don't care how they justify it afterwards.  that's what they say this shameless use of essentialist language.  it is as if that's how they talk.  it is as if I somewhere existed, at least in a purely virtual way, before I was born with a fixed identity, and it happened from time to time that then I was born into a wrong body.  Finally, through the transgender operation, I can find my own proper body.  Now you will say, this is a fiction.  Of course it's a fiction.  But it's, if I may put it like this, a truthful fiction.  I am an atheist.  I don't believe we have an eternal nature which includes sexual identity before we were born.  What I'm only saying is that in our society, sexual, symbolic, and so on, practice, the way we act, we act as if we have such an a priori identity.  And that's this paradox of how Our practice retroactively presupposes or posits such an essence which doesn't exist in itself.  It's the act of freedom, what Hegel called self-positing.  For example, my other hero is, I like this news article.  who was the big other who intervenes now.  You know, recently I read, I like this crazy news, in newspapers that a guy in India, Robert something, I forgot his name, but he's an Indian, is prosecuting his parents, put them to court.  Why?  Claiming they gave birth to him without asking him for a permission.  In some sense, he is right.  Right.  We don't have this closed loop.  It's a fiction, but it's not simply an ideological fiction.  You know why it's not?  I don't have time to go into it.  It's simply a fiction.  Because it is a fiction only if you presuppose that there is a full texture of fully determined reality.  But the moment you accept that there are cracks in reality, that reality is in itself... incomplete, then such retroactive loops where an effect retroactively posits its cause, such loops are possible.  What I'm saying is that, let me give you another example.  Let's say something it's not fashionable to talk about today, passionate love.  It's the same essential category.  Of course it's contingent, always, whom you fall in love into.  But once you fall in love, it's essential.  What do I mean by this?  You never really choose it.  You don't decide, now I will fall in love.  You just live your stupid daily life.  Maybe you have a one night stand here and there.  You drink, whatever.  Then all of a sudden the catastrophe happens.  You don't fall in love.  That's crucial.  You realize that you are already in love.  This is what I'm talking about.  And the great German idealist Schelling knew this perfectly.  When he realized, when he wrote that the true free decisions that constitute us are unconscious decisions.  They never happen unconsciously.  in the present.  Like all of a sudden I knew that I have decided.  And I claim the choice of our sexual identity is something like that.  And so again, for me to really think our gender identity, I will not go now into the distinction between sex and gender, of course, we have to think these two aspects together.  A true materialist is not just a cheap historicist who say everything is historical and so on and so on.  One has to add something.  I don't have time to go into it.  If you want to go into it, read my last book and so on.  It's that eternity itself is historical.  True anti-essentialism means that there are eternal essences, but they emerge at a certain historical point, and retroactively they become eternal. ",
