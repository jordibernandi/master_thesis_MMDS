Freedom News Now is on the front lines to hold accountable the new modern day brown shirts.  Here to fully ensure they follow rule of law and honor their oath to the U.S.  Constitution.  On this night, these brown shirts were strongly fixated on one man's right to freedom, and they would let nothing or no one stop them from stripping this man of his rights to be free.  Officers detain the passenger of a white truck when he refused to give them ID.  The passenger of a parked vehicle has no obligation to produce identification to the government agents, who in this case are revenue collectors primarily for the county, not serving and protecting, but harassing and collecting from citizens of Jackson County, Michigan.  This one single ambush, possibly unconstitutional stop by the Jackson County Sheriff.  yielded four deputies, one sergeant, and four patrol units at the cost of thousands of dollars to the citizens of Jackson.  All this wasted money, time, resources over a warrant for unpaid ordinance tickets to the state.  Give us your money or we will take your freedom.  The state will use force, violence, and coercion to get what they believe is theirs, not yours.  This is why it is more important now than ever before to hold your public officials accountable.  Not one of us is stronger than all of us.  Rise up together and fully support the First Amendment audit community.  Always record.  Stay strong.  Never give up. ",

Thanks for smashing that like tab.  If you're new here, smash the subscribe tab, smash the like tab.  If you're just stopping in here at a gas station in Jackson, Michigan, Jackson County Sheriff got one detained.  They called for backup.  I believe the detained individual gave a fake name to police.  He got busted when they brought the verification system.  I think it's called ASIS.  They found out who it was and Now I believe he may be taking a ride downtown.  Yeah, they're going to loosen the cuffs up for him.  Do you think they loosen the cuffs up for him if the camera wasn't here? ",
