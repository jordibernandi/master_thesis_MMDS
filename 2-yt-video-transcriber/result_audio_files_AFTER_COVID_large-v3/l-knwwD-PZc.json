            "text": "What is a wealth cycle?  And, you know, there's only so many different asset classes, and I've picked the three major ones here, paper assets like stocks and bonds, real estate, and commodities, which include precious metals, but precious metals are a little bit different than the rest of the commodities because they're also money.  So they're a safe haven asset in times of crisis.  So there are some times when commodities can be going down but precious metals go up.  But if investors are rushing from other asset classes into one asset class, pushing this asset class into a bubble, shouldn't it be drawing currency away from the ones they're selling?  and shouldn't those fall?  Yes, I mean it should, except we live in a world where they're constantly creating currency and everybody is getting a little bit of this currency.  And so instead of the things that are being undervalued falling, they either go sideways or they increase just a little bit as the one asset class is going into a bubble because of all of this currency creation.  And so This is based on a real world example.  It's just a very simple diagram, but this is from the 70s.  If gold is going up and if stocks or real estate, it was both stocks and real estate in the 70s, but I'm using stocks here because I'll show you the actual chart of that later.  If gold is going up at a much faster rate, and it did during the 70s, stocks rose a little bit, but basically they were sort of bouncing along sideways and going up a little.  If you were invested in gold when you sold 10 years later, you could buy many, many, many times more stock.  If you were invested in stocks when you sold, you could only buy a fraction of the amount of gold that you could have had you just invested in gold in the first place, or conversely, just to spend it on food, gasoline, your house payment, a new car, whatever.  Stocks did not keep up with inflation during that period of time.  But then one asset becomes too overvalued, the other one becomes too undervalued, and the cycle reverses, and it did for 20 years.  Gold went down from 1980 to the year 2000, and stocks entered a bull market.  that was one of the greatest stock bull markets in history from 1980 until the year 2000 with the blow-off top of the tech bubble.  And then it reversed again, and we're about halfway through this cycle right now.  And what's happening here is they're printing currency right at about this rate in the middle.  So this is the investors rushing back and forth from one asset class to another, but the one that's underperforming doesn't actually go down because they keep on printing all of this currency.  Now, if you take one asset class and divide it by the other asset class, and it doesn't matter which way, which direction you do this.  You can take gold divided by shares of the Dow or the price of the Dow Jones Industrial Average or S&P 500 divided by gold or your house divided by gold or bushes of wheat or tons of iron or barrels of oil or shares of the Dow.  And what you discover is that everything is trapped in what I call a valuation range.  And you can be invested in one thing for a very, very long time and end up nowhere.  But if you can measure when something is overvalued and something else is undervalued, And you can see that because you have to measure it to be able to see it.  You can't see when something's overvalued or undervalued in this monetary system that's constantly expanding.  And so... If you can see that, then you can sell the overvalued asset class and buy the undervalued asset class.  And it's like busting these cycles apart and pasting the next wave onto the end of the last one.  And it is a road to true wealth.  I'll show you that in a moment.  Now, some of the examples I'm going to give here, I understand that nobody can catch the exact top of anything.  and that these are much longer time frames than most people's lifetime even.  However, I just want to show you the immense power of this, the types of gains that can be made.  This is in the 1920s.  This is an upper middle class home, nice like four bedroom, large home with a swimming pool in the backyard and a decent amount of land.  And that sold for about $3,000 in the 1920s.  And gold was $20 an ounce back then.  So it would have cost $3,000 or 150 ounces of gold.  Conversely, if you had sold the home, you could have gotten 150 ounces of gold for it.  And then in the 30s, because of, and this is just a few years, I mean, this could have been 1928 and this is 1932.  So it's not very long that you had to wait.  The house fell to $2,000.  Gold was now $35 an ounce, so that meant that this house only cost 60 ounces of gold.  If you had sold this house for $150 and bought gold and then repurchased, you could have gotten 2.5 times the amount of real estate in just those few years.  Then in 1970, that house was now $30,000, but gold was still $35 an ounce.  So it cost 850 ounces of gold.  So if you had bought this home, the 2.5 times more real estate in the 30s, and then in the 70s sold for, when it was $30,000, 850 ounces of gold, you would have received 2,125 ounces of gold.  Then, just a decade later, because of rampant inflation, the house was now $60,000.  But gold became free trading in 1971, and it went from $35 an ounce up to $850.  So that house was now worth 70 ounces of gold.  It went down from $850 down to $70 during that period of time.  So if you repurchased real estate with your 2,125 ounces worth of gold, you would have now gotten 30 of the same type of home that you sold in 1920.  You would now own 30 of them.  And then in the year 2000, gold bottomed at $250.  That house was now worth $200,000.  Same house.  The house hasn't changed.  It's $200,000.  But gold had gone down, so it now cost 800 ounces.  And so if you sold the house in the year 2000, you would have received 24,000 ounces of gold.  Then, in 2011, gold hit $1,925 an ounce.  And the house was now worth $300,000, but it was only worth 150 ounces of gold.  So you could have, in 2011, bought 160 homes with the proceeds from taking this one home and just going back and forth to different asset classes.  160 homes.  However, this cycle isn't done yet.  You'll see later.  in the Dow Gold ratio, gold's price went from 35 to 200 from 71 to 74, and then it went back to 100 to late 76, and then it took off and went to 850.  We're basically in that mid-cycle correction now, and it's pretty much over with.  And so now we get to see the fireworks of the end of this cycle.  I don't know when the end is going to be.  I don't know if it's going to be 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, could be 2023.  But what I'm fairly confident in is that that house It could be $30,000 measured in US dollars if we're still fighting deflation and we don't have any big inflation.  But it could also be $3 million if the Federal Reserve is fighting deflation and they just print and print and print and it keeps on going into real estate and the stock market.  But either way, measured in gold, it's probably going to be somewhere around 50 ounces of gold.  And if it hits 50 ounces of gold, that means you could buy 480 homes.  that are the same home that you started here with in the 20s.  It's just the same investment, just jumping from different asset classes.  Now, the gold that you received here makes you worth, let me see, I think that was about $30 million worth of gold.  If you hang onto it and buy this real estate, this is about a billion dollars worth of real estate.  So you've gone from $3,000 to a billion dollars.  This sounds absurd, but these are just numbers.  This is an exercise on what is a wealth cycle and how big is its power.  So this is the maximum power.  You'd have to have a lot of luck, but you can catch quite a bit of this wave just by looking at numbers and making the right decisions.  Now I'm going to show you a real-world example of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.  This is it measured in points.  And this is a fairly old chart.  It would take several days, if not a week, to update this presentation to today's prices and everything.  I'm teaching a concept here.  At the end of the presentation, I'll give you today's price of gold, and I'll tell you where this would be if these charts were going today.  But when you take this chart that goes back to the year 1900, when you take it and divide the points on the Dow, which are basically determined by the dollar value of the underlying stocks, so call points dollars, take the points on the Dow, divide them by the price of an ounce of gold, And you get the Dow Jones Industrial Average not priced in dollars, but priced in gold.  And what you see is that it's going nowhere.  It goes up and down.  The bubbles are getting bigger because we keep on printing more and more and more fiat currency.  But there's a mean here, an average that it goes through.  It's going to return to that, and it's probably going to overshoot.  And when it does, I think that this is one of the greatest opportunities presented to anybody in modern times, and I sort of see this as an inevitability.  And one thing I do want to say is that to show you that if you ride just one asset class, you potentially get nowhere over a lot of your lifetime.  If you had invested in stocks in 1929, right at the peak of the stock market bubble, it would have cost 18 ounces of gold to buy one share of the Dow.  and if you held on to it for eighty nine years those stocks and sold them.  now you could buy nineteen ounces of gold.  your return for the whole eighty nine year period was five point six percent.  it's about six one hundredths of a percent per year and you know there were periods during this time when we had raging inflation.  in other words you didn't go anywhere you were invested your entire lifetime and you didn't make a gain.  so If you take this, you can see that there's sort of a cycle here, but if you really want to see the cycle, this is the Dow measured and priced in gold.  But if you take gold priced in the Dow, you get this chart, overlay that with the Dow priced in gold, and now you can really see a cycle.  I mean, that is just a perfect cycle that you can jump in and out of, but you only have to make a few decisions in your entire lifetime to be an immense winner.  If you're invested in stocks and you ride them up and sell and buy gold and measure to see when gold is getting overvalued and stocks are undervalued again, go back into stocks and then back into gold and then back into stocks and back into gold, If you had invested back here just $30 in stocks and did this technique, your $30 would have become $15 million from just $30.  Now, This, again, is almost impossible to catch the exact peak and the exact bottom of everything and to have perfect timing.  But it just shows you the immense power of this.  And if you only catch one or two of these in your lifetime, there's still immense gains that you can make.  And you're escaping that valuation channel.  That is the most important thing, is getting out of that valuation channel and actually going somewhere.  The total maximum that you could have achieved here is 50 million percent returns.  That's unheard of.  Now, this also would have taken three generations.  This is more than 100 years.  You're talking about 1903. to the year 2018.  So that is the end of this portion of the presentation.  The next portion is going to be the everything bubble.  We're going to update you on where stocks are, where real estate is, where bonds are.  So thank you very much for watching this section.  I hope you really got something from that because this is the difference between price and value.  That home went up in price constantly.  But the value measured in gold went from 150 to 50 to 850 down to 70 to 800.  So it was bouncing in that valuation range that I was talking about.  Learn these things.  It's a powerful tool.  We'll see you in the next piece. ",
