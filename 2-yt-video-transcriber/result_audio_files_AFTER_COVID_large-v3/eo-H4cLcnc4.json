            "text": "I was out doing errands Tuesday and heard a clip of Donald Trump saying, don't be afraid.  He was referring to COVID specifically, but he was talking about everything, wasn't he?  Of course, the left attacked his statement.  The people who had put Donald Trump onto the trash heap of history want very much for us to be afraid.  They want black people to be afraid of white people.  They want gay people to be afraid of straight people.  They want poor people to be afraid of rich people, and they want us all to be afraid of a virus with a 99% survival rate.  They want you to keep your mouth shut because you're afraid of being called a racist or a sexist or a homophobe or a xenophobe, to sneak around and speak in a whisper if you support a duly elected president.  They want you to be afraid of being thought stupid or mean or narrow-minded or simply deplorable.  I don't agree with the president on every issue.  At the ceremony for Amy Coney Barrett, I think he should have had everybody in the audience wearing a mask.  And I wasn't too sure about the ride he took with the Secret Service.  But I know why he did those things, because don't be afraid.  From the time he took over his father's business, he's lived by that motto.  Nobody thought a kid in his 20s could swing with the big boys of Manhattan real estate.  A fearful person wouldn't even have tried.  But Donald Trump isn't wired that way.  He doesn't do fear.  I got home that afternoon and sat down to write about it, and I heard that Eddie Van Halen died.  It hit me harder than I thought it would.  Eddie was my age.  We grew up a few miles apart.  In high school, I went to parties where the earliest versions of Van Halen were playing.  Everybody in town knew they were good, but I never heard anybody say that they were about to take the world by storm.  And then they did just that.  because don't be afraid.  Eddie Van Halen was among only a few rock guitarists to ever be that influential.  Hendrix, Clapton, maybe Stevie Ray Vaughan and Eddie Van Halen.  Innovators can't be afraid.  Fearful musicians like fearful politicians just imitate what they see others do.  They know that the people who stand between them and success want more of what they already understand.  Whether it's an A&R guy at a record company or the hacks in charge of a political party, the gatekeepers want something that they know how to sell.  Some shiny new face to service the status quo.  When Van Halen hit, every guitarist in America was still working on being Hendrix or Clapton.  And six months later, they were all trying to play like Eddie.  Quick story.  I met the Van Halen brothers on Independence Day.  This would have been 1979, I think.  There was a hair and nail salon called Victor Sabino's in Sierra Madre, one town over from Pasadena.  The Van Halens got their haircut at that salon.  My best friend Glenn and I also got our haircut there.  And we were both dating women who worked there.  Victor, the owner, had legendary parties every 4th of July at a house on the sand in Laguna Beach.  And that year, Glenn and I were invited.  We didn't know that Eddie and Alex were also invited, but there they were.  And things got a little crazy.  Alex and Glenn were in charge of the fireworks.  This was a couple thousand dollars worth of heavy artillery that had been smuggled in from Mexico.  Rockets were lined up for 100 yards, stuck into the sand, and everybody up and down the beach was out on their decks and balconies.  Victor gave the order, and then it was Alex and Glenn leapfrogging each other with torches in hand, lighting off the inferno.  The rest of us saw two young maniacs laughing their heads off, silhouetted against the apocalypse.  It was amazing.  Later, I went for beer.  It was Schlitz malt liquor for Eddie and Alex.  When I got back, most of the people had gone home.  Somebody talked Eddie into showing a photo album of pictures from their world tour.  There was one shot that I think was from a festival in Brazil.  It showed him from behind with a sea of upturned faces stretching away into the infinite night.  I said, that would scare the crap out of me.  Eddie said, yeah, you can't let that get to you.  You just plug in and do it.  I tried half-heartedly to make it in music myself.  Glenn turned his obsession with engines and speed into a career that found him building cars for people like Unser and Andretti.  He's now doing something with a guy named Musk.  I owe him a phone call.  I wasn't so brave.  I wore myself out on drugs and drink and eventually 35 years of task work.  But I plugged away with my stories and songs, and I pretty much conquered all of my demons by the time Donald J. Trump did the impossible and won the presidency with even the party whose banner he carried mostly lined up against him.  It was two months after his inauguration that Jason and I posted our first videos on Facebook.  The protests and riots and slander and intimidation were already raging in the party of division that calls itself progressive.  And we just felt like, okay, enough's enough.  I have no idea why we thought that anybody would care what we had to say, but for once in my life, I wasn't afraid to take a risk.  I'm guessing that a lot of you felt the same way.  Did you ever hurt yourself on a job site and pretend that you weren't in pain?  I sure did.  I needed to finish every job so I could feed my family, and I had to live up to what I'd promised the people who hired me.  I didn't want somebody to see their house painter limping across the lawn and wonder if I could finish what I started.  I guess that's why President Trump did a drive-by outside the hospital, so that people could see that he was still on the job.  As Eddie Van Halen has sadly reminded us, there are no superhumans.  Not even the guy who erupted in the music world like Vesuvius with a Marshall stack.  Not even Donald Trump.  Eventually, we all face down the setting sun and leave the world behind.  But for those of us on both sides of this camera, that day can wait.  We have our work cut out for us, and this is no time to cower.  Long ago, in an America we would hardly recognize, a man who had been crippled by a disease much worse than coronavirus hid his paralysis from citizens and told them that the only thing they had to fear was fear itself.  This week, a man who might be having a little trouble breathing gave us the advice he's lived by.  Don't be afraid.  Don't be afraid.  Don't be afraid.  Thanks for watching.
