            "text": "This is what happens when YouTube allows me to post a poll on my channel.  Not that type of poll.  Readers, I have something very important I need to tell you.  Some of you probably already figured it out if you follow me on Twitter.  Mostly because I told you on Twitter.  But for those of you who don't, I think it's only fair that I let you know.  I'm black.  Wait, no, everyone already knows that.  I'm a furry.  A casual furry, but a furry nonetheless.  Yep, been in the fandom since fall of 2006.  Got a fursona and everything.  And whenever I have the opportunity to support a furry artist that I admire, I cop a commission or support their Patreon if they're a decent person, even if the character I'm getting art for isn't an anthropomorphic animal.  Of course you have people that look down on the fandom because they either find the entirety of it weird or tend to frown on the not-so-safe-for-work side of it resulting in making fun of the fandom as a whole.  To which I say, don't be mad at us just because nobody loves you.  That's why I found it absolutely amusing that Beastars, the newest anime to exclusively hit Netflix, recently opened the doors to the furry fandom to a lot of people.  So much that it's getting people to dip their toes in the waters.  the same way a lot of us got into the fandom, by looking at other animal characters and giving them a humanoid visage.  And that's what Marco the Artist over on Instagram did after he watched Beastars.  He took some animal characters he grew up with and proceeded to have them stand on two legs with his art across social media.  The animal characters in question, however, are from Disney's The Lion King.  And as a result, non-furry black folk are losing their minds, both in a good way and a bad way.  Now, as a casual furry, seeing these mockups isn't a brand new thing for me.  To be honest, those same folks who ain't used to nothing and are calling these furry thirst traps honestly don't know what they're talking about.  These are not furry thirst traps.  Trust me, I've seen furry thirst traps, especially Lion King furry thirst traps.  These are rated E for everyone.  If you want real furry thirst traps, specifically line one since we're on theme, I check out Nuxlite.  He's a great queer furry artist with a really great style and can do G-rated stuff just as well as the male-leaning, adult-oriented stuff he dishes out.  He even did his own versions of Mufasa and Scar based on Marco the Artist's take on the two, and those pics look great.  I'd definitely give him a follow on Twitter if you're over 18 years old, or if you don't feel comfortable making a Fur Affinity account.  But yeah, readers, Marco's Lion King stuff is actually pretty tame, and they each have a lot of personality behind them.  And that's why I actually want to go through a few of them right quick.  Oh, come on, you knew what this was.  So let's begin with the ones that started this whole thing, Mufasa and Scar.  So I can't be the only one that can just sense the Atlanta influence in these designs, right?  Not Atlanta the show, I mean Atlanta the... Atlanta.  Like, Mufasa looked like he taught Idris Elba how to pose for the camera.  And Scar looked like he about to fight Rick James to win the heart of Tina Marie.  Do you not see this?  Sarabi.  Or as I like to call her here, Sarabi P. Henson.  Like, y'all can see it, right?  I'm not going crazy.  Like, the way old dude drew Sarabi here is just radiating all the Taraji P. Henson vibes for me.  And It works, it works really well.  There was one that he did where he put her and Scar together, but we don't believe in that.  That ship is against my religion and in this household, we serve the Lord.  Not really though, I'm agnostic, but you know what I mean.  Rafiki looks like the amalgamation of every black uncle that tries to be suave trying to stunt at every black gathering since the beginning to the end of time.  Look at the smile.  Look at the changes made to his facial hair.  Look at his outfit.  Now tell me I'm wrong.  You can't.  Because you know I'm right.  Simba and Nala, Ah, Nala's in Beyonce's Adidas collection because she's voiced by Beyonce in the CGI movie.  And then Simba's in the green outfit because Jay-Z's married to Beyonce IRL and was in that same green outfit in that one music video.  the two of them made in the loo.  Okay.  I see you out here with your hidden references and whatnot.  But yeah, I don't see thirst trap when I see this.  I see we got each other's back.  We practiced that ride or die philosophy.  We a double income household.  Like they just look like those Gen Xers that found a way to turn the lemons.  boomers left us into lemonade, you know?  And no, that Beyonce pun was not intended.  But it works.  Timon and Pumbaa.  I've seen these two in real life before, and I hate the way this makes me feel.  Especially Pumbaa.  I feel like I grew up with this dude.  We lived on the same street.  When we got older, he started dressing exactly like this.  What is happening?  And I am absolutely sure I went to middle school with Timo.  He was a transfer student from Alabama.  We bonded because we had the same lunchbox.  This is insane.  Kiara.  What in the name of love and basketball?  Like, I see it and I'm not mad at it.  So I just hope she gets her scholarship.  Kovu.  I mean, just because he was a fuck boy in the beginning of Simba's Pride, don't mean you gotta depict him like that permanently.  I mean, he got better.  There was proper character development involved.  I don't think this is fair.  By the way, you have no idea how many women, especially black women, I know that legitimately finds Kovu sexy.  I'm not going to say that's ridiculous because we all have our vices.  I'm in a polyamorous relationship with Winston from Overwatch and Thrall from Warcraft after all.  But you'd be surprised at how many people have actually dipped their toes in the furry fandom even before things like this Lion King artwork or the Beastars anime hit American shores.  If you want the socials of any of the artists that I featured in today's video, there'll be links in the description box below.  But other than that readers, your homework assignment for the day.  Write in the comment section below which piece of Lion King fan art was your favorite or If you feel like sharing with the rest of the class, whether or not you want me to review Beastars Season 1 for an installment of Anime Saturday.  Not gonna lie, it's probably gonna happen regardless of what you say, but I at least wanna know how many people are gonna watch it.
