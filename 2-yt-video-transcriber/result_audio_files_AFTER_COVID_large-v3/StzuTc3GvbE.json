And we have to remember, yes, it was about Bloody Sunday and you and I and others were there.  That was my last big event before the pandemic was to be there with John, with you and so many others to walk across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in March.  But let's also remember that John Lewis was the first person to testify in the Senate hearings to get rid of DOMA and to talk about the connection between Loving vs.  Virginia and the LGBTQ movement for same-sex marriage, and he would talk about love is love.  John Lewis was front and center in the fight for immigrant rights, where he talked about how immigrant rights are about civil rights.  John Lewis was part of the creation of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.  By the way, Mitch McConnell needs to put the Voting Rights Act, H.R.  4, on the floor for a vote.  It's been 225 days and needs to name it the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. ",
