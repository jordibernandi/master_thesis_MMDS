We'll report on that.  And our presidential historian will offer clarity, perspective.  In the debate, the president told a group of white supremacists, some of whom stood by those in Charlottesville with their torches, to stand back and stand by.  Joe Biden declared the duly elected president of the United States unfit to lead, called him a racist, a liar, a clown, and told him to shut up.  We've never seen any of this, not in America.  But from this, we march toward the vote. ",

Does anyone in the anyone in their right mind think for one second that Joe Biden was not capable of having a civilized conversation last night on the issues?  The fact of the matter is, is that Donald Trump made it impossible.  And yes, Donald Trump is a racist.  He is a clown.  He is unfit to lead.  And he most certainly needs to shut his orange mouth.  So Joe Biden did nothing wrong last night.  And the problem is, is if the media continues to draw a false equivalence between the awfulness and the downright madness and sociopathy of Donald Trump last night with what Joe Biden did, then we will always have this asymmetrical fight in this country where Donald Trump can get away with inciting violence through his white supremacist militias.  while we won't be able to tell him to shut his orange mouth without the media calling us all the same.
