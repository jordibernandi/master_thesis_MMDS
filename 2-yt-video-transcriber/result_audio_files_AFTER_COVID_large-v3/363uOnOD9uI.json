            "text": "So we're at a point in our lives, and these kids are being taught, that words hurt more than physical action.  Physical violence and punches to the face are punished less than words are.  Thank you.  What is going on, everybody?  I know I haven't posted in a little while, but this situation that I got going on right now has been, it's been bothering me.  It really has been.  And it hits a little close to home because it is within my own family.  And it's just such a clear sign of the times and of what is going on right now.  So I have a niece and a nephew, and they're both in middle school.  And typical middle school drama, right?  Some girl was basically talking shit on my niece and my nephew got sick of it and wasn't having it.  My nephew, he's a man's man.  I mean, he plays hockey.  He's one hell of a hockey player.  He fixes things, man.  I tell you what, the one time he was replacing a bike tire or inner tube on his bike and he had asked me like, how do you do this?  How do you How do you take apart the wheel?  How do you get the inner tube out?  And I showed him one time, one time, and it was amazing.  He has that fix it gene.  You know, I talked about that before where not everybody has the fix it gene.  I put the two screwdrivers in, you know, I put one in, flip the tire, put another one in and flip the tire up again.  And then when I moved the first one over to flip up another part of the tire, it was like a light bulb went off.  He just went, oh, done.  Kid understood it was tearing his bike apart, repairing it himself.  So this kid's a smart kid.  He's a good kid.  Um, this girl's making fun of my niece, right?  Just, just the girl in question that was doing this, honestly, here's the situation with her.  She was super popular because she, uh, developed a little bit faster than everybody else, if you know what I mean.  So, uh, it had brought her a little bit of attention and a little bit of popularity.  Well, that popularity has since been dwindling because I think she's a little bit of a, you know, not a great person and people are starting to see that and it doesn't really matter anymore.  People are past the fact you have boobs and a butt.  Um, Um, so this girl is desperate to try to hold on to whatever popularity she can get or she has left.  So she's, she's running her mouth about my, my niece saying some things about her that my nephew didn't really appreciate.  And my nephew sends her a Snapchat and it's basically, you know, these kids now they like to talk through the Snapchat back and forth.  They don't really text each other because they think it just goes away.  And what they'll do is they'll take a picture of like whatever, like the roof of a bus or something.  That's what they did.  They were on a school bus.  They took a picture of the roof of the bus and then they just put a, uh, he put something over top of it and I don't have the thing in front of me right now to read you what it said, but it said something along the lines of like, basically keep your mouth shut.  You fat bitch.  Something along those lines.  Okay.  hilarious, right, I mean, it made me laugh, but I get it that it's, you know, did he need to say that to her, technically, no, but at the same time, he's standing up for his sister, right, he's being, you know, he's being a good brother, he's being a good big brother, he's standing up for his little sister, he's putting his chick in her place, who needs to be put in her place, she's, you know, she's spreading rumors, she's, you know, picking on the sister, so he stands up for it, This girl, now this was a whole conversation that was going on, right?  This is bad.  I know this sounds like middle school bullshit because it is, but there's a point to this story.  So there's a back and forth going on here, right?  She's saying things, they're saying things, she's saying things, they're saying things.  None of what she said or they said was technically recorded, right?  Because with the Snapchats, especially when you do the picture thing, When you do the picture thing, it's gone.  Once that's opened, it's gone.  You can't, unless you screenshot it, you can't see that again.  So there's not even records ever through Snapchat.  Like technically, from what I understand, Snapchat can pull text messages that you send back and forth, like the messaging part of it, but any pictures that you sent, they don't have any access to.  because could you imagine how many pictures are sent every day through snapchat for them to store?  all of that information would be massive right so he said.  so they like to do it that way that way that it just kind of goes away.  they think this girl takes a screenshot right so she takes a screenshot of this you know keep your mouth shut whatever and she takes it to the principal of the school because this happened on the school bus.  It is considered to have happened under the umbrella of school being responsible for you.  So technically, they are responsible for you all the way up to the point that you get to your house type of a deal.  So whatever.  So they take this text message to the principal.  The principal then, I guess, contacts.  I don't know if he has to contact the superintendent, whatever.  They basically say... We're going to send you to court.  We're going to contact the magistrate and they're going to file charges based on, I want to say it was like disorderly conduct or something like that.  This text message, words, simple words, right?  He didn't tell her to go off herself or anything like that.  He didn't call for people to go attack her or beat her up or anything like that.  He simply told her to shut up.  Stop running your mouth about my sister.  Shut your mouth, right?  Simple, right?  You want equality, ladies?  This is equality, okay?  You want to be treated the same?  If you want to be able to run your mouth and say whatever you want, guess what?  People are going to run their mouth and say shit right back to you.  And it shouldn't matter if it's a boy or a girl or whatever, okay?  So this paperwork gets turned over to the principal.  Principal says, you know, we're going to have to contact the magistrate on this.  We didn't get any paperwork on it.  My sister didn't get any paperwork on it.  So we were just kind of like, ah, whatever, you know, whatever it is, who knows?  So it turns out they did.  They go and they file this paperwork with the magistrate.  And now he basically has a court hearing where he has to go show up and defend this text message, this one little glimpse of a conversation, right?  Now, here's the part that's starting to piss me off is not too long ago, This is going to make my niece and nephew sound like troublemakers.  They're not.  My niece is a little bit more of a troublemaker.  She just got a little bit more of a... She got some spunk to her, right?  So... But here's the deal with these kids.  They're not troublemakers, but they don't take shit.  That's the difference, see?  Nowadays, kids who stand up for themselves and don't take shit are troublemakers.  You're a troublemaker for standing up for yourself.  You're not allowed to speak out like that, right?  So... Somebody was messing with her in the cafeteria, and this girl started trying to, like, fight her or whatever.  And my niece and my nephew, they'll go at it.  Like, they don't beat the shit out of each other, but they'll wrestle and stuff like that.  Like, my nephew, you know, I used to always think, like, why?  Like, this is bad.  You shouldn't be letting him do this.  But then now I'm like, I kind of get it because he's kind of toughened her up a little bit and got her, you know, that edge that she needed to be able to stand up for herself.  So... The girl's running her mouth, whatever goes down.  She pops her, right?  Pops her right in the face, right in the middle of the cafeteria, right in front of everybody, right?  Pops her.  Nothing.  She gets like a day of suspension or two days of suspension, something like that.  No magistrate contacted.  None of that shit happens, right?  No court, none of this shit.  So two people, actual physical violence on another person, actual assault of punching a person.  You know what the principal said?  Well, when it comes to fights, we have a policy where the first time it happens, we handle it all in-house.  After that, if it happens again, then we contact the magistrate.  But when it comes to words, we immediately contact the magistrate.  So we're at a point in our lives, and these kids are being taught, that words hurt more than physical action.  Physical violence and punches to the face are punished less than words are.  That's insane to me.  That is an insane concept to think that we're at a point where words are so hurtful.  Oh my God, he told me to shut up and called me fat.  Oh my God.  I'm screenshotting this.  I'm telling the principal.  And then we're going to take one little portion of a conversation that we don't even know.  None of these people know anything about it, right?  They don't know anything that was said before that.  They don't even know what she said to provoke that comment.  They're going to be the judge, jury, and executioner of this trial based off of a screenshot of one small portion of an entire conversation.  How are we letting this happen?  How are schools getting to this point where we are... Now, think of it this way.  We were just talking recently on the video about men's rights and child support and things like that.  And I remember Rocco brought up a really good point about how the court system... is they feed off of this stuff, right?  They feed off of child support payments and all that.  There's so many people in every little city who are employed and have a full-time job with full benefits and everything, probably a pension, all kinds of shit.  Because you have to pay child support and they get to process that payment and they get a little chunk of that from the federal government and everything, right?  So same thing goes with this.  These little small magistrates in these little suburb areas are probably feeding off of this, things like this, things that these schools that are sending these kids to the magistrate over stupid bullshit, over words, okay?  So... We take it a step further now.  We got other teachers treating my nephew like a piece of shit for what he said because he said it to a girl, right?  So let me pose this question to you.  Do you think, comment down below and let me know, do you think that this same situation would have been handled the exact same way had it been a girl sending that exact same message to another girl or a girl sending it to a boy?  Do you think that either of those situations would have been handled the same?  Or do you think that only because it was a boy saying it to a girl that it is now considered to be, you can't do that.  This is horrible.  We have to correct this action.  We have to beat this out of this kid.  We have to make him feel like such a piece of shit for standing up for his sister, right?  We have to beat him down and make him feel like less of a man because of it.  This attack on masculinity and on men is just... insane.  it's insane how deep this is going all the way down to now.  the school systems right these public schools.  i want to pull my kids out of school personally.  i would like to pull them out and i would like them to do some sort of a cyber school and especially for high school.  i'd rather them do a cyber school and start educating themselves at home on on you know through uh youtube or anything like that.  start educating themselves on the things that they want to do as a career or things that they're interested in.  right because let's face it my kid made a great point to me the other day.  i was talking to her about she's uh she's gonna be 15 this year.  so we're kind of having the talks about driving which i don't even want to get into.  it blows my mind.  i have to think about that.  um but i told her i said well the first step that you do when you start driving is you got to go.  you get the book and you read the book and you learn all the laws and the.  you know the different signs and all that crap.  and then you go take a test on it.  I was like, but you got to study the book and all that shit.  And she goes, I'll just watch a YouTube video on it.  And I was like, oh my God, you're spot on.  Spot on that there is nothing that you cannot learn by watching YouTube videos.  Nothing.  Anything.  You want to tear apart your car.  You want to fix my vacuum.  I fixed my washer.  Like anything you want to repair or want to learn, there is somebody on YouTube ready and willing to teach you.  Why are we sending our kids to these shitty school systems where they push all these social and just liberal agendas on them?  We'll give you a snapshot of a few other things that have happened at my kid's school just this year that my kid has come home laughing about.  They had a special guest speaker in their health class who talked about the difference between sex and gender.  And sex is what you're born with between your legs, but gender is how you feel on the inside.  Come on.  I don't need this shit being taught to my kids, right?  This isn't what I want them to be.  They talk all the time about how, oh, these kids aren't learning about sex and stuff in health class.  You're 100% right.  Nobody is talking to them about sex in health class.  When I was in high school and shit, we went to health class and they told you about sex and they talked about all that stuff and pregnancy and how all this stuff works and everything.  Now, health class \u2013 and let me preface this with this.  Their health class teacher \u2013 has to be 180 pounds overweight.  I mean, the dude's gigantic.  I don't even know.  He couldn't run if he wanted to.  He hobbles down the hallway.  How do you have a man who can't even take care of his own health teaching other kids about health?  That's because they're not talking about health.  You know what they're telling them?  They're talking to them about accepting yourself and body positivity.  And it's like anti-health is what it is.  Right?  So we have that situation.  We have the teacher who talked to my daughter about, do you think it should be okay, or do you think people should be able to marry whoever they want?  Bitch, they already can.  What are you talking about?  If a man wants to marry a man, a woman wants to marry a woman, or a man wants to marry a woman, they can.  Nobody is stopping them.  What are you talking about?  Do you think a man should be able to marry a dog?  Do you think a woman should be able to marry a horse?  Where are you trying to go with this type of talk?  Nothing.  You're just trying to push this agenda that same-sex couples are shit on and they're not allowed to do the same things that other people are.  Bullshit.  You know what I always say?  You could have same-sex marriage all you want.  You know what comes with same-sex marriage?  Same-sex divorce.  Good luck with that.  So then that same teacher also brought up... Do you think that it should be okay for people to kill somebody, to murder somebody else or kill somebody?  I forget the exact wording, but I was like, I would hope that every kid in that class 100% knows.  You know what?  Not even hope.  I guarantee you, every kid in that class would say, it's not okay to kill somebody.  Nobody out there is thinking, none of these kids in this school are thinking, boy, you know what?  I just wish it wasn't, I wish I wasn't allowed to kill people because I would just stop.  Like I'm just going on this killing rage and just, you know, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill.  That's all I do.  And then I think the last thing that she had brought up was, oh, she played a video about the women's soccer team.  And it was a complete, you know, liberal agenda, feminist type video where it talked about how, you know, they don't get paid as much and how they're not treated as equal as the men.  And all this bullshit that we all know is fake.  We all know.  I've done videos on it that completely debunk.  the, the, the, uh, gender pay gap, right?  It doesn't exist.  Um, and at the end of the video, you know what she did?  She looked at all the kids in the class and she goes, now girls, of course, address the girls, right?  Now girls, how does that make you feel knowing that these men are getting paid more than these women for doing the exact same job?  How does that make you feel?  Keep your social agendas away from my children.  That is not why they go to school.  See, that's the problem right now with educators.  And that's the reason why I shit on teachers.  I shit on them.  I have zero respect for teachers.  I just don't.  I'm sorry.  I don't.  If you're a teacher, I'm sorry.  I got no respect for what you're doing right now because of bullshit like this.  You are no longer teaching these kids.  You got grown kids.  You got soon-to-be adults and adults that are in college.  that don't even know about the wars that we've been in, the changes, the amazing things that have happened over the years.  as far as, I mean, hell, people don't even know about communism, socialism.  They don't even understand Mao and the things that happened in places like Venezuela and everything.  They don't know any of that shit.  They're not even teaching it.  They don't know anything about their past.  They're keeping these kids dumb.  all school is doing right now is pumping out good little victims and they're taking men and boys like my little nephew and they're beating that out of them.  They are beating it out of them.  They do not want you to be a man.  They do not want you to have masculine tendencies.  You know that I'm, I'm sure.  I am sure that this judge and the judge is a dick.  All right.  I know the judge.  Other people know the judge.  They've dealt with them before this magistrate, whatever you call them.  Uh, He's a dick.  And I can guarantee you, I'll guarantee you right now what's going to happen in this little hearing, what he's going to try to do.  He's going to try to shit on my nephew.  He's going to try to talk down to him like he's some horrible person for sending this atrocious message to this poor little innocent sweet little girl, right?  And then he's going to try to punish him and teach him a lesson by shoving him into some sort of community service for some ungodly amount of hours, 50 hours, who knows?  They'll put them in and they'll be like, yeah, you got to go do all this bullshit, right?  We're going to punish you.  We're going to make an example out of you so that nobody else has the nerve to stand up for their sister and to put somebody else in their place who's running their mouth and trying to start shit, right?  I think that's the biggest issue we got right now.  When I was a kid, When I was in high school and middle school, and I'm sure a lot of you guys will say the same thing, if you ran your mouth and you ran it to the wrong person, you were going to get popped.  And if you couldn't stand up for yourself and you couldn't hold it for your own, you either A, stood up for yourself and popped them back or whatever it took, or B, you shut your mouth, right?  We've lost that now.  We've lost that.  These kids are less likely to pop each other in the face and more likely to run their mouths at each other all day long.  And when somebody finally does come along and says, I ain't taking that shit.  Boom, the horrible people, right?  Nobody cares about what the other person did.  Nobody cares about what led up to that moment.  All they care about is this horrible boy said these horrible things to this poor, innocent little girl.  And we can't allow that.
