And it makes you humorous and charismatic and attractive.  And I think you appeal to young people the way that... outside intellectual rebels appeal to young people.  And so those are all positive things that can be used positively or negatively.  And my question is, like, it seems to me that you're... you're... your reputation, unless I'm very misinformed about this, is as a strong supporter of Marxist doctrines on the left, or was that?  And so then, my question is, given the originality of your thought, Why is it that you came to presume, at some point in your life, perhaps not now and perhaps still, that the promotion of Marxism, say, rather than Zizekism, was appropriate?  Because it seems to me that there's enough originality in your body of thought and lateral thinking in the manner in which you approach intellectual ideas that there's just no reason for you to be allied with a doctrine that's 170 years old.  if capitalism is rife with problems, is twice as rife with problems as that.  And so you're kind of a mystery to me in that way.  And so that's my question. ",

            "text": "Okay.  Very briefly, I developed systematically in my books critical insights into many traditional Marxist theses, so no doubt here.  You know what I still admire nonetheless in Marx?  Not those simplicities of Communist Manifesto, but I still think that.  his so-called critique of political economy, capital, and so on, is a tremendous achievement as a description of the dynamics of capitalist society.  And if you read it closely, Marx is much more ambiguous and open there.  For example, he mentions, for example, apropos what you referred to, he mentions that law of diminishing return, like why crisis will arrive necessarily, poor are getting poorer, but then he is honest enough to enumerate seven or eight counter-tendencies.  And if you read him closely, you will see that precisely those tendencies prevailed later.  Forget Communist Manifesto, go to read his political analysis of its unsurpassable 18th premier and so on of the 1848 revolution, which are incredibly complex, no traces of that class binary there.  Marx deals with middle classes with crucial lumpenproletariat with the ambiguous role of intellectuals and so on and so on.  but basically what I was pleading for and I like to put it in paradoxical term was for a return of from Marx back to Hegel.  I define myself more as a Hegelian.  why?  Hegel is considered.  Hegel is considered a madman, you know, the guy absolute knowing and so on and so on.  No, Hegel is much more modest and open.  The danger in Marxism is for me this teleological structure.  We are at the zero point, but there is a unique chance of a reversal into a new emancipated society and so on.  And the danger here is that of self-instrumentalization.  Proletarian Communist Party is an agent of history which knows the loss of history, to put it, follows them, and so on.  That's the catastrophe.  In Hegel, such a position is strictly prohibited.  In Hegel, whenever you act, you err.  So, you know... You have to, there is no position of this pure acting where you know what you are doing and the result will be, so I, this would be my main point.  So yes, my formula is kind of, ironically, I know Hegel is the greatest idealist, but materialist reversal of Marx by turning back to Hegel.  For Hegel, Hegel says in a part that people don't read, introduction to philosophy of right, he says explicitly that the all of Minerva takes off in the evening when there is dusk, so philosophy can just grasp a social order when it's already in its decay, Philosophy cannot see into the future.  It's radical openness.  We need this openness today.  The tragedy today, maybe we agree here, is that we really don't have a basic, how should I call it, cognitive mapping.  I don't think we have here a clear insight into where we stand, where we are moving, and so on and so on.  So I'm much more, again, sincerely of a pessimist. ",
