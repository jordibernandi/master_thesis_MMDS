Bro, when I lived in LA, police used to harass me like gangbangers.  They would literally roll up on the side of you at a red light and mad dog the shit out of you just waiting for a reason to pull me out of the car.  Ugh.  The problem we have with cops is that when they get there, they escalate the situation and they can arrest both parties or end up physically harming us.  Fuck the cops, for real, for real.  Yeah.  Anyway.  I'm done with this PragerU video.  Look at the comments.  It's not even, this is on Twitter.  I didn't see it on YouTube.  Um, yeah, but what do you fail to understand is I don't really care.  I just wanted to fish.  Okay, well, here, take two weeks off then to contemplate. ",
