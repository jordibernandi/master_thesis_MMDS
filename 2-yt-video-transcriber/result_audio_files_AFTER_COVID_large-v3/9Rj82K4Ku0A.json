You also moved from our old house to our new house.  How do you feel and what can you share with the people on Hey There Humans?  If there's one greatest issue, one greatest lesson that I take away from this pandemic and doing this show, it's, wow, we're all in this shared human experience all around the globe.  No matter who you speak to, their lives have been impacted.  People are the same, similar hopes and dreams, similar senses of humor.  I love how The Office is a show that has really swept around the globe and people all over the globe love it and laugh at it and with it and that's such a wonderful miracle to be a part of.  We're in this together and no matter who we are, no matter where on the globe we are, and that is a very special and beautiful thing.  Steve is using my Instagram because he has no Instagram because he's so old.  hey hi steve how are you? ",

And rather than exacerbate that feeling of tension.  And I guess brittleness is a word I keep coming back to, because it's not like any of these are necessarily bad people, but... There's a lot of anxiety right now, but not to feed into it, I guess is my point.  Not to not to brace yourself, but to open yourself to it. ",

And I just sort of lost it, you know, at the end of your rope.  And again, with all the tiredness and not to excuse myself, but I was ticked off and I kind of unleashed at him like, what the hell, man?  Why did you do that?  And he did something and I'll never forget it.  He came, he just backed away and said, are you, are you all right?  Like he reached out.  It was, it was such a significant moment for me because it, because I was expecting him to lash back at me like, yeah, well you, you drank my diet Coke and, you know, or, you know, get into it that way.  And it completely disarmed me.  And it, And there was a lot going on in my life.  There was a lot of tension.
