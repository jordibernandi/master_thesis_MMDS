            "text": "Somebody got a door.  Blank Beats Productions.  This is not the Christian music that you're used to.  There's a lot of false prophets trying to confuse you.  God said you got talent, let me use you.  Give yourself to the Lord, become a new you.  Okay, I know the devil's trying to get me.  I say no way.  I'm going to tell you what these false teachers won't say.  It's the God of the world.  You can't go both ways.  Can't go both ways.  First off, you can't play both sides.  Let me know right now.  Is it water?  Is it God?  And I'll get persecuted by both sides.  But I'll let you know now that I won't apologize to the LGBT.  That they can't control me because somebody got to tell the world the truth.  You know it's an abomination.  And I ain't the one to say it.  Look in Leviticus.  You can see the proof.  Secondly, marriage is between a man and a woman.  Got a husband for a wife.  You got a wife for a husband.  And that's two between God.  It's either that or nothing.  Stop infringing on the word.  That's the end of discussion.  Ego trying to Bible dump again You know since before marriage is a sin And I know nobody's perfect but it all should be condemned If somebody tell you that it ain't wrong that ain't your friend.  This is not the Christian music that you used to.  There's a lot of false prophets trying to confuse you.  God said you got talent.  let me use you.  Give yourself to the Lord, become a new you.  Okay, I know the devil trying to get me.  I say, no way.  I'm going to tell you what his false teachers won't say.  It's either God or the world.  You can't go both ways.  Can't go both ways.  Nah, why ask for forgiveness if you don't plan to change?  They turn on God for money.  They turn on God for fame.  And then they try to switch the word to fit what they do.  Y'all might want to read Matthew 10.32.  How you cheating on your wife and then you laugh about it?  How you go get an abortion and then go brag about it?  This world is getting farther from God.  I'm mad about it.  And you know that persecuted are blessed.  Man, bring the hook in.  I ain't got to say the rest.  This is not the Christian music that you used to.  There's a lot of false prophets trying to confuse you.  God said you got time.  Let me use you.  Give yourself to the Lord.  Become a new you. ",
