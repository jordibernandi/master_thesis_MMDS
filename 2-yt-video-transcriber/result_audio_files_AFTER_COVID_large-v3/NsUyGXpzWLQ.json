            "text": "hey yo what up youtube y'all know who it is.  drop down tv like always before i get all my videos started all eyes on brie all eyes on brie and to kentucky.  get that shit right out there.  yo we gonna keep preaching.  if you don't want to hear it go to another channel.  now For the ones that really been asking me, like, yo, Drop, why you don't do no more videos where we get to see your face and all that?  Only thing you want to do is edit videos.  Look at my face though, people.  See, Drop going through this thing with Drop trying to grow his beard back out, right?  And, and pretty much the dudes know, man, when y'all stop growing that beard, when we start growing our beards back out, that shit don't be sexy.  That shit don't be sexy at all.  So what I did, I say fuck it until I get my growth in order.  I'm going to stay far away from the camera as possible.  But I mean, at the end of the day, I look at it like this.  You don't want to see drop and drop nasty beard process, man.  Go to another channel, go find somebody else to watch.  I mean, it ain't all about the visuals all the time.  But at the end of the day, I really did this video based on my dude that gave me this.  He didn't give me nothing.  Dude, he thought he was dropping off some jewels and giving me some information.  And he was an older dude, so I respected that.  You know what I'm saying?  I listened to what he had to say.  I mean, I'm not going to take what he said and everything he said and wash it and flush it down the toilet.  But a lot of things dude was saying about an FAC was out of pocket to me.  I mean, first of all, and then for the people that are saying, yo, why you always addressing the haters on NFAC?  Come on, man.  I mean, it's enough people putting them down.  Why you ain't got people out here trying to big them up?  I mean, it's enough channels out here trying to talk about how bad NFAC is and how much of a crook Grandmaster J is to the point it's insane to me.  So how you going to crucify me?  But try to come save a situation when you got a thousand channels on YouTube that's trying to bring this man name down through the mud.  You know what I'm saying?  I've always said from day one, you don't have to approve with everything Grandmaster J say.  Not at all.  I don't approve.  I don't agree with everything that dude say.  But what I do stand for is that movement, though.  Stand by that movement.  I mean everything everything and made for everybody to agree with.  I mean so to get to the to the older dude who's saying like we Reaching for something that if it ain't been done see this is my thank you.  see you you got false hope.  You gonna tell me we reaching for something that we've been reaching for 100 years and ain't got there yet while we keep trying Brother that mean you selling for less.  I I mean, I got kids out here, dude.  I don't know about you.  I mean, I know you're pretty much older than me, so your kids is probably grown.  But I got young kids out here, man.  And I feel like if this fight don't start and we end it, I don't want to leave it up for my kids to end up fighting and saying, well, we going through pop.  So at the end of the day, if you want to give up and And put your flag in your back pocket and do whatever you want to do, man, that's on you.  But don't knock people that's trying to make a better change for 2020, man.  I mean, my kids, I don't want my kids coming up the same way I did.  I don't want my kids to have to experience this racism shit that I did growing up.  Even though we grew up in New York City and everybody thought everything up south was free.  yeah we was free yeah we was free but yeah god racism was up there too.  i mean racism was everywhere.  so you can't say just because i was up north you didn't have to experience racism as much as y'all did down south.  that's a lie.  it may not have been as thick it may not have been as thick but trust me we went through it too.  so all that about people up north didn't have to go through racism that's a lie.  we had to go through it too.  you understand i'm saying so at the end of the day I'm not down to nothing.  you told me yesterday because brother you sat out there in that parking lot for about 20 minutes once you found out who I was and you tried to sit and tell me on how we running America down through there by uploading and that's crazy.  That's how I know you out of touch because it ain't nothing about these YouTube videos.  that's running America nowhere yo.  I don't know who you listening to or where you getting your advice from but ain't none of these YouTube videos sending people places that we ain't never been before.  You understand what I'm saying?  At the end of the day, I love all my black people.  Just like I told you, Scooby, before I left, man, old man, no disrespect to you.  I mean, I understand when you're accustomed to living a certain way, you don't want change.  I mean, and I understand you in your late 50s and Probably maybe early 60s.  And I understand you done been through a lot.  And you probably don't see how we gonna get out of this situation we in.  If you look back at your past, the only thing we have been doing is fighting for the same thing up until the present day.  But how dare you tell us to stop fighting?  How dare you tell us to stop fighting?  I mean, I got kids to fight for.  I mean, I'm pretty sure you got grandkids to fight for, pops.  Maybe not your kids, Pops, but you got grandkids you want to fight for.  So you sitting around telling me just because you know I upload these videos on NFAC, you're going to try to convince me to hell.  Oh, brother, you going to hell because you're trying to tear, man, I'm not trying to tear nothing apart.  America's already torn apart.  Racism was here before me.  Racism was here before you, old man.  You understand what I'm saying?  This ain't nothing new.  Racism has been here.  And it's not going nowhere until we make it go somewhere.  You got it.  You can't stop the fight.  For you to sit and tell me, brother, I don't know why you continue to fight.  That heart broke me.  How you going to tell me why do we continue to fight?  Come on, man.  See you.  Harriet Tubman would have loved a lot of y'all, man.  That lady would have loved a lot of y'all.  She would have killed a lot of y'all, but she would have loved a lot of y'all, too.  Because, boy, I tell you.  I mean, and that's crazy.  And she said it best.  She could have freed more slaves if they had have known they were slaves.  Bro, you old man, you don't even know you a slave.  And it's sad.  It's sad for a young girl like me.  And I'm not, I mean, I'm not young.  I'm 40 plus years old.  Probably was older than me.  You done been through more than me.  You done seen more than me.  I mean, don't you want better for your grandkids?  I want better for mine.  I don't want to leave my daughter behind a whole bunch of... Do you see what we leaving behind?  Do you see what we leaving behind, young old man?  I don't want to call you old man.  I don't even know your name.  You'll probably never get to see this video.  But at the end of the day, black people, I want to say as a whole, man, we got to stop the hate on each other.  We got to continue this fight.  I mean, I don't know what this old man Great was with NFAC.  I have nothing to do with that.  He feels some kind of way.  Oh, y'all doing this and y'all doing that.  Hey, man, I don't know what day.  I don't know what channel you watching or who's feeding you this information about.  We trying to start a civil war, my dude.  We not trying to start no civil war.  And then for you to sit and tell me if I'm uploading Grandmaster J videos, NFAC videos, I'm a part of the problem.  Brother, how about you being a part of the problem from not understanding what we're going through?  I'm not the problem.  I'm trying to be part of the solution.  But at the end of the day, to me, it seems like you're the problem, man.  You're the problem.  And it's sad to say, and that's because you come from an older generation, man, and I understand how you think, because that's how my uncles and them think.  I mean, they look at it like if ain't nothing broke, why fix it?  They don't see this pot is broken to hell, though.  They don't see we broke.  They don't see that this pot is broken into a million pieces.  You understand what I'm saying?  So I'm not going to knock you for feeling the way you do.  I just hope you understand and wake up one day and understand, yo, if we don't fix it now, it'll never get fixed.  It'll never get fixed.  And I'm in the mood to fix it now.  That's why I upload these videos.  Granted, I don't have the biggest channel in the world.  I don't have 20, 30, 40,000 followers.  I got 14,000 subscribers.  I reach 14,000 people.  But I hope these 14,000 people I reach, I hope this word touches you.  We got to continue this fight.  Don't let these people... I brainwash you out of what you think is right.  Because this fight is what we need.  This fight is what's right.  Us giving up is what's wrong.  Because we have been giving up for so many years.  I feel like right now that we do not get it right now and fix it now.  It's a wrap for us, boys and girls.  And I love my people too much for it to be a wrap for us.  So if it's up to me, I will continue to upload these videos.  I will continue to give you my thoughts.  I will continue to go around interviewing people that got these little small, long businesses that's trying to get a voice out here and trying to come up in the world.  I have no problem with it.  That's how I give back to my people.  It's not a lot.  I don't have a million dollars to sit around and lie and tell y'all I'm about to go open up this school.  or I mean, I do the best I can for my situation.  And it works out for me.  People understand and respect what I do.  You understand what I'm saying?  And I'm going to continue doing it.  I mean, no disrespect to the old man.  I mean, everybody's entitled to their own opinion.  I'm quick to say that.  That's why I'm quick to rebuttal, to give you my opinion on how I feel about certain shit, because everybody's entitled to their own opinion.  You understand what I'm saying?  I wasn't going to try to hold people today.  I mean, I just felt after I dropped that first video this morning, with Grandmaster J saying like, nah, man, we ain't, we ain't, we're not a cult.  And then it just dawned on me that the old man yesterday had this whole conversation with me on.  How many upload these NFAC videos is bad for the community.  The only thing he's doing is trying to tear the community apart.  That's not it, Pops.  That's not it.  That's far from the case, Black Man.  Black Man dropped diamonds here for a positive reason and a positive reason only.  You understand what I'm saying?  And I hope you get it right, man.  I hope you get it right.  And I hope I see you in the near future.  so I can ask you your hot things looking for you, brother, because I don't want the worst for you.  I want the best for all my brothers and sisters.  That's all I want.  No more, no less, yo.  And let's drop down.  That was my 10 minutes and 35, probably 40 seconds by the time I get up off of here, yo.  But y'all stay blessed, yo.  One love and I'm out. ",
