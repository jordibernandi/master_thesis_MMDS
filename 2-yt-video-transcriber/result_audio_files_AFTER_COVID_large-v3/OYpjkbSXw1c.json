            "text": "A sitcom needs to be relatable, its characters familiar, as a television series is a commitment of several years of the audience's life.  A sitcom often mirrors the lives of the audience, and because of this, the characters are often members of the lower economic classes, waged or salaried workers, laborers, and those performing essential duties while on the low run of the ladder.  some sitcoms in which class is featured lean in heavily on the social concerns of the lower classes more than the economic concerns and some barely mention either.  the series that do reference economic concerns do so at their own risk as poverty is not inherently funny.  married with children was the rare sitcom that frequently referenced the family's poverty but often blamed the bundy family's circumstances on the fact that al married peg or on customers making al's occupation as shoe salesman so painful or at least in one case on a curse.  Home Improvement had the flavor of a working-class series but without the economic concerns.  Tim fancied himself a man's-man, blue-collar hero bathed in a romanticized laborer's masculinity while maintaining local celebrity status and a house in the suburbs.  the simpsons only glibly mention the family's occasional economic concerns often to the point of parody in which homer is able to land many different occupations some of them high paying over the course of the series.  now infinite run.  some working-class television series have the relatable family patriarch as a police officer which muddies the waters of class conflict further.  Sitcoms balance relatability with aspiration.  Characters need to have enough in common with the audience for them to relate to them, but not so much that the audience's stresses and concerns play out with too much familiarity on the television screen.  Sitcoms traffic in comedy and poverty is not funny.  and then there's bob's burgers a long-running television comedy in which virtually everything that happens is seen through the lens of the family's ongoing economic concerns.  the series stars bob belcher the owner of bob's burgers a fairly unsuccessful burger restaurant or slop shop as the children mockingly declare.  linda the wife of bob and unpaid worker at the restaurant and their children, Tina, Jean, and Louise, all three unpaid workers at the restaurant where they work after school.  It is unclear exactly how much money Bob makes, the expenses of Bob's Burgers, the expenses of three children, and the cost of the rent in the apartment above the restaurant where they live, but the series makes it clear in almost all of its 194 episodes that the restaurant is not popular, the family is constantly behind on bills, always late on paying the rent, and unable to provide much for their children.  While many comedies shy away from this, Bob's Burgers consistently references the family's poverty. ",

            "text": "the series actually uses the word poor on a regular basis anathema in sitcoms.  in addition to these references episodes often center around bob trying to dig his family out of poverty or trapped in situations caused by their poverty.  In Season 1, Episode 6, Bob takes a second job as a cab driver at night while working in the restaurant during the day.  In Season 1, Episode 7, Linda turns their cramped apartment into a bed and breakfast.  In Season 1, Episode 12, Bob laments that his burger restaurant is struggling because he lives in a seafood town that hails the annual Lobster Fest as its biggest event.  The series often references movies that have working class economic concerns, such as Season 2, Episode 1, which recounts the events of The Goonies, or Season 2, Episode 2, which recounts the events of Dog Day Afternoon.  Bob's efforts to increase traffic to his restaurant often blow up in his face, such as in Season 2, Episode 4, in which Bob buys an arcade game that eventually mocks him in his own restaurant.  or in season two episode five in which bob buys the cheapest vehicle possible to supplement his income with a food truck.  these are only a few examples and only in the first two of the series ten seasons so far.  in addition most of the family's rivalries and personal relationships are shaped through class.  Tina's primary rival throughout the series is Tammy, a popular girl who transferred to Wagstaff School in Season 2, Episode 8.  Tammy is spoiled and is a bad influence on Tina, but the conflict is more that of personality than class until Season 4, Episode 13, in which Tammy refuses to invite Tina to her elaborate and expensive bat mitzvah.  Louise convinces the party planner to no longer be Tammy's subject, and Tina steps in, takes over the party, and makes it more fun for everyone, while Tammy is stuck in a giant representation of her own head towering above the partygoers.  The imagery is not subtle.  Tammy is, perhaps, not as rich as she believes herself to be, as Season 6, Episode 10 reveals that her parents must have lied to her about Wagstaff being a private school when it is, in fact, a public school.  Tina's most notable relationship is with Jimmy  Jr.,  the son of Jimmy Pesto, Bob's most immediate economic rival.  Jimmy Pesto is the owner of an Italian restaurant across the street.  Bob is simple, honest, and poor, whereas Jimmy Pesto is flashy, dishonest, and successful.  Jimmy is not actually Italian, but changed his name to fool his customers about the authenticity of his restaurant.  jimmy is not rich but his restaurant is successful placing him in the middle class or perhaps even upper middle as a business owner with real paid workers.  jimmy consistently mocks bob through classist insults about their comparative levels of success and the family's poverty.  Bob's Burgers Confronts the Myth of Meritocracy.  Many episodes remark on the fact that Bob makes excellent burgers at affordable prices.  Season 5, Episode 5 shows how much craft Bob puts into his work, competing for the title of Best Burger.  However, Bob is consistently outclassed by Jimmy Pesto, who uses low-quality horse meat, mostly uses frozen food instead of fresh food, and doesn't know nearly as much about food preparation as Bob.  Another rival who is shaped through class is Randy, a filmmaker who first threatens to put Bob out of business for serving hamburgers, then rivals Bob with a successful food truck and is generally a thorn in Bob's side.  Randy is a trust fund kid, a fail son of some unexplained fortune. ",

            "text": "We prefer the term lucky baby duckies.  Yet another antagonist shaped through class is Helen, a woman who inherited wealth when her husband passed away under mysterious circumstances.  She's introduced in season 5 episode 19 and then reappears in season 9 episode 12 in which the children compete with her over a missing valuable.  bob does not maintain many friendships devoting nearly his entire life to his family and his restaurant.  however his best customer a working-class laborer named teddy forms a bond with bob which is only sometimes reciprocated.  teddy is a self-employed handy man and bob is a small business owner with no hired workers.  Bob and Teddy don't have much in common, but this shared lifestyle will always mean Bob will have more in common with Teddy than with, say, Randy.  Bob's Burgers frequently portrays the police as either incompetent or actively harmful to the communities they are presumably instructed to protect.  In Season 1, Episode 5, the police are represented by two officers who pass by the restaurant as it's being robbed and then fail to go after him when he robs the restaurant again.  By Season 2, these officers are gone and the face of the police is Sergeant Bosco.  In the aforementioned bank robbery hostage episode, Bosco fires on the bank several times despite the fact that it puts Bob and the other hostages at risk.  the robber mickey is not violent but poor.  after mickey is arrested and eventually released he becomes a friend of the family and later gains employment at the wonder wharf again.  bob and mickey have little in common but their shared class fosters solidarity.  class shapes every relationship in the series.  In addition to this, class shapes the episodes, though some are more overt than others.  In Season 4, Episode 15, Tina, Jean, Louise, and their friend, regular-sized Rudy, are locked in the back of a train for wine connoisseurs.  Unwilling to accept their status as second-class citizens, they plan to rob the train of its chocolate.  In Season 6, Episode 11, Tina, Jean, Louise, regular-sized Rudy, and a few others ask to share the bounce castle with the wealthy birthday girl.  She rebuffs them, and they seize the bounce castle for themselves.  Season 7, Episode 17 revolves around Bob and Linda winning a contest to take part in an elaborate LARP of the show's Downton Abbey proxy.  Their roles are assigned at random, and Bob and Linda are given the parts of servants while other guests are given the parts of the wealthy, a nod to being born into one's economic circumstances.  Bob is tempted by the wealthy LARPers into being a class traitor, but he eventually sides with Linda and her revolt against those who were assigned wealth.  Life was horrible back then if you weren't in the super upper class.  I'm just glad that we live in a time where there are no classes. ",

            "text": "In Season 9, Episode 3, Tina, Gene, and Louise join a school extracurricular in which they create a small business selling wooden figures.  Tammy, Jocelyn, and Jimmy Jr.  nonchalantly take power and assign themselves the roles of management, doing comparatively little work but gaining far more rewards than labor.  Tina initially sides with management until she realizes what this is doing to her siblings and to regular-sized Rudy.  When labor recognizes the unfair power dynamics, they fight back, eventually making the small business collectively owned and operated among all workers.  These are only a few examples.  More than anything else in the series, the class conflict is highlighted most by Mr.  Fishoder, the landlord and the richest man in town.  mr fishoder is not just the antagonist of one episode but the primary antagonist of the series positioning class conflict as an inescapable aspect of every episode of bob's burgers regardless of whether or not mr fishoder appears because the belchers are always living and always working on their rented property.  rent seeking is as unjustified as leeching the profits of labor from the workers.  a rental property is not simply something someone owns that others want to buy.  it is something someone privately owns that the entire community needs to live and that cannot be realistically used only by the owner.  The series humanizes fish odor from time to time, but the belief that rent is exploitation is not a personal jab at individual landlords, but a condemnation of the practice.  Whether or not Fish Odor is a nice guy is irrelevant, though the series clearly frames him as, at best, aloof, and at worst, uncaring and conniving.  In Season 1, Episode 13, Fish Odor shows Bob that the games he owns at Wonder Wharf can almost never be won, which is allegorical for the promise of wealth to the lower classes that is historically incredibly difficult to attain.  Bob's Burgers highlights the exploitation between landlord and tenant in various episodes in which he has the Belchers perform unusual tasks for him in exchange for leniency on their often late rent.  This is not generous on the part of Fish Odor.  If the Belchers can't pay their rent, they're out on the street.  It's an ultimatum that the Belchers must agree to, and Fish Odor recognizes this.  Class conflict is perhaps the most overt in Season 5, Episode 21, in which Mr.  Fishoder threatens to raise the rent on much of the town.  Bob organizes a rent strike and marches to Mr.  Fishoder's mansion.  Fishoder does what those with power and wealth always do \u2013 divide the working class against itself.  He organizes a water balloon fight, with the winner receiving several months' free rent and the losers suffering through the raised rent.  The town briefly goes along with it.  Basically capitalism brain.  The idea that instead of organizing to avoid everyone being exploited, some will focus on the extremely unlikely chance of becoming the exploiter.  In the end, the town recognizes this, organizes against Mr.  Fishoder, and Bob convinces him to keep the rent as is.  A small victory.  Bob's Burgers has a lot of humanity to it, a lot of talk of the common good, rarely punching down, fairly inclusive, and largely avoids the faux edginess that has plagued other animated comedies and has engendered unpleasant fanbases.  Faux edginess is not bold.  Bob's Burgers is bold because it has the audacity to talk about concerns of the poor in a way that does not shy away from that word, and does not shy away from who maintains economic disparity.  That may or may not be the goal of the series or the intention of the writers, but in an attempt to make the series relatable, it has done just that.  Marshmallow in the house.  Now put a burger in my mouth. ",
