Please remove the hat and the boot tube before you give any more distress to the United States Marine Corps.  Sir, I didn't give you that.  You're also wearing a Silver Star device with a valor device, which is not an authorized award.  You also have three service strikes with 12 years of service.  Yes, sir.
