            "text": "Thank you for tuning in to Terry Sue videos.  I wanted to talk about this website OnlyFans.  There's this IG model who makes $30,000 a month doing walking videos.  She's a big booty model.  In all her videos, she's just walking up and down the street or walking through a store.  But all her videos are she's just walking.  And people pay her $30,000 a month to see her videos.  Now how OnlyFans works, any woman can go on this site and you can post your photos, you can post videos, and people will pay you to watch your videos.  But what blows me away is people, and it goes by your donations, it's similar to Snapchat.  where people can donate money to you.  But this woman gets $30,000 in donations each month simply doing walking videos.  She'll wear some tight shorts, she'll put on some shorts or some yoga pants, and she'll just walk through a store or walk through a parking lot.  And all these men are paying their $30,000 a month.  That's insane.  Do you know there's some kids that are dying from cancer that have a GoFundMe page that can't even raise $1,000 for their treatment?  But this woman can go on OnlyFans and make $30,000 a month simply doing walk-in videos.  They call it walk-through videos.  Delicious also does videos like this.  I like the fact that it gives people an opportunity to make money legally.  A lot of women who used to do this, they used to have to go to the strip club.  They used to have to do all types of little things in order to make their money.  But nowadays, any woman that's attractive, any woman that has a nice shape, You can go on OnlyFans, you can go on Snapshot, or you can start your own website and make money right online.  So it's kind of given a lot of adult entertainers the own way to make their own money.  Because back in the day, if a woman wanted to make money in the adult entertainment industry, she had to go hire a manager, or she had to go hire a pick, or she had to go work for somebody in order to make her money.  But nowadays, with social media and the internet, any woman who's attractive, any woman that has a nice shape, you can go right on social media and make money.  And make tens of thousands of dollars.  And what blows me away is these are just simple videos.  You don't even have to do porn.  You don't even have to have sex show yourself nude or anything because by my knowledge she doesn't do any new photos.  she doesn't do any porn.  all she does is these walking videos.  if people are paying her thousands of dollars to walk do walkthrough videos it's so easy for women to make money.  if the man wants to make money he has to actually do something in order to earn that money.  We can't just go on social media and do a walkthrough video and people are going to pay us thousands of dollars.  So it's much easier for a woman to make money than it is for a man to make money.  Even here on YouTube, even here on YouTube, any woman can do clothing videos where they're changing their clothes in their videos.  clothing haul videos, a lot of thick women on YouTube are doing these clothing haul videos, and they're making thousands of dollars in endorsements, thousands of dollars in ad revenue.  So it's much easier for women to make money on social media than it is for men.  Because no matter how attractive a man is, he's not going to be able to go on OnlyFans and make the type of money that she's making.  I don't care how attractive you are.  You could have a six-pack abs.  You could look like Mr.  Universe.  You're not going to be able to go on OnlyFans.  You're not going to be able to go on social media and make the type of money that these women are making.  No man is going to be able to make the type of money selling their body the way these women are able to make money.  And they don't even have to do a whole lot.  Like I said, she's just doing walkthrough videos and she's making this type of money.  So I'm happy to see a lot of these women are making their money independently and they don't have to work for a pimp.  They don't have to work for the adult entertainment industry in order to make their money anymore.  But it just blows me away how women can make money so easily on social media.  So if you're a young woman who's broke, Any woman nowadays, any attractive woman who's broke nowadays is broke because of yourself.  Because there is no excuse for any woman nowadays to be broke.  Especially if you're an attractive woman.  Any woman that's attractive has no excuse to be broke.  Any woman that's attractive nowadays has no excuse to be broke.  Because any woman that's even remotely attractive can go right on social media and make thousands of dollars.  Simply doing clothing videos, doing walkthrough videos.  You don't even have to do anything lewd or you don't even have to do anything that has to do with porn or any of that thing.  All you have to do is model some clothes.  or show yourself walking or show yourself dancing.  you don't even have to do anything over the top in order to make money on social media.  this is how easy it is for a young woman to make money and you don't even have to be a young woman because a lot of these meth videos a lot of these older women doing meth videos.  they're making just as much money as the younger women are making.  so you don't have to be some 20 year old size two size woman in order to make money.  You can be a 40 year old woman as long as you got yourself in shape, as long as you are attractive, you can get on social media and make thousands of dollars.  So I'm happy to see that a lot of these young women are making money independently.  They don't have to go to a strip club.  They don't have to work for a corporation.  They don't have to work for a pimp in order to make their money.  So I'm not hating.  It just really blows me away how a lot of men out there would pay all this money to a woman just for doing walkthrough videos.  Now, her name is Lola Coyne.  Her name is Lola Coy.  You can follow her on Instagram.  You can follow her on Twitter.  She's starting to get a huge following on social media.  And there's a lot of women doing what she's doing.  So I'm not hating.  I just want to show that a lot of these young women can make money independently.  A lot of people have different opinions about this topic.  Leave a comment.  Rate and subscribe. ",
