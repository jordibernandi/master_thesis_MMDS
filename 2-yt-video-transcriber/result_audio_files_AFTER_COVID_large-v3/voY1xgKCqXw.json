            "text": "Hey, peace and blessings and Shalom.  Now, welcome to probably the briefest ever edition of Maccabees TV.  It's your brother, Priest Daniel Alonzo of Israel Maccabees Alliance Council.  Yeah, that still exists.  We still here.  Talk about that another time.  So just a quick public service announcement.  So today the big news was Kamala Harris.  was selected by Joe Biden to be his running mate for president and she being the vice president.  Now, I hear a lot of different things, but there's something I'm not hearing.  So I just wanted to add this to the conversation for you, brothers and sisters, for those of you that don't know.  And here it is.  Here's the great reveal.  Kamala Harris's husband likes wearing Small hats.  You might say to yourself, what the hell is he talking about?  Well, this is the new YouTube era where you can't say certain things.  So you have to read between the lines.  Kamala Harris's husband likes wearing small hats.  Shout out to Irritated Gene.  This is not original.  I didn't come up with this.  He likes wearing small hats.  What type of small hats does he like wearing?  Well, that's the question that you need to ask.  So let me show you.  Because when I show you, you'll understand exactly where I'm coming from.  The small hats he likes to wear are these.  Look at his last name.  He likes to wear small hats.  And in this environment, in this day and time, it just so happens that people that like to wear these type of small hats are at war with the Israelite community.  They're shaming the cannon.  They're shaming Deshaun Jackson.  They're trying to cancel Ice Cube.  They're trying to cancel Jay Electronica.  They're trying to cancel Larry Johnson and everybody else.  People that like to wear small hats don't like us.  So make sure, make sure that when you guys are talking about Kamala Harris and her husband, make sure that you mention that he is one of those people that likes to wear small hats.  and they are against our community.  So if peradventure they were to win this election, oh, that's a whole nother level.  I just wanted to add that I promise you there's way more coming.  I'm still here.  I make a video in a week, but I'm still here.  I'm working on some internal things within Lions of Israel, but I'm still here.  And I'll be right back with that fire that you guys know that I bring.  This is your brother, Priest Daniel, Lions of Israel.  I just wanted to add that in.  This is your brother, Priest Daniel, Lions of Israel, Maccabees.  Alliance Council.  And with that being said, I say Shalom. ",
