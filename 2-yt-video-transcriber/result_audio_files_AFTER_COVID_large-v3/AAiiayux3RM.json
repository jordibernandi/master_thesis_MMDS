            "text": "That wasn't difficult, was it?  Now, there are people who would make you believe that this is difficult.  There are people right now asking the question, why should I have to wear something like this?  There are people acting as if being required to do this is some sort of oppression.  It's some infringement on their personal freedom.  They're so upset by it, so incensed at the act of putting cloth over their faces that they're protesting, that they're complaining on social media, that they're berating store employees.  And the truth is, when you wear something like this or you refuse to, you're making a statement.  The statement you're making when you wear this is, I give a damn about other people.  That I have compassion for the world around me.  That I'm trying to love my neighbor as myself.  That I trust science.  That I'm trying to do less damage in the world than more damage.  And when you refuse to simply do this right now in the middle of a deadly pandemic, you're making a statement too.  You're saying, I don't care about other people.  I'm not particularly concerned about my own health, but I don't care about the health of my family or the health of strangers.  I'm not willing to be inconvenienced in the slightest if that will help other people not get sick or not die prematurely.  So wearing this or not wearing this is a statement about your level of empathy.  But we also know it's a political statement right now.  To watch tens of thousands of people die over the course of eight or nine weeks and to refuse to wear something like this out in public makes the statement, I am so beholden to my political affiliation that I will refuse to acknowledge the severity of the situation and I'll refuse to do even the smallest thing to try and help other people.  And if you will wear something like this, you're making the political statement that what we have happening in our country right now in leadership is unacceptable because human lives are not expendable.  So you're making a statement about your level of empathy.  You're making a statement about your political affiliations.  And strangely enough, there's another statement I see people making.  I went to the store tonight and maybe 80% of the people who were there weren't wearing masks, which was inexplicable to me.  But I saw a lot of couples and if they were men and women and only one of them were wearing a mask, invariably it was the man who was not wearing a mask.  And it got me thinking, Guys, are you trying to make a statement about masculinity by not wearing a mask?  Are we really there?  Are you flexing in the face of a pandemic?  Because that's not how it works.  I don't know what you think real men are, but to me, real men care about other people more than themselves.  Real men go through life trying to protect humanity, not endanger it.  Real men don't care how they look.  They care about the effect that their lives are having on other people.  So right now, yeah, you're making a lot of statements for wearing or not wearing this mask.  About your level of empathy.  About your political affiliation.  About how you view humanity.  And so if you are one of those people who... does take the trouble to do this before you go out.  Thank you.  Thank you for having a level of empathy that goes beyond just caring about yourself.  Thank you for walking out into the world and trying to be a source of healing and love and kindness.  And to those of you who refuse to wear a mask right now, who refuse to do this simple task, I'm not sure what matters to you.  I'm not sure how you view yourself and the world around you, but I don't think in the middle of a pandemic that has killed tens of thousands of people that you can walk around without one of these and still claim that you're pro-life.
