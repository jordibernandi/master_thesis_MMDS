            "text": "Some of you, I can't even imagine the hardship that you're going through right now.  I can only just say, it's hard.  I'm trying to even imagine what it would be to be in a desperate place like some of you are in.  And then you hear the scripture, God works all things for good.  And maybe it's frustrating to you.  Because how in the world could a good God put the term good plans on what you're going through?  I know that sounds crazy, so I don't want to say it lightly.  But what I do want to do for all of us is gently ask, how are we defining good?  Because it's easy for us to define good as comfortable or easy or prosperous.  Right?  I mean, how's your day?  It's good.  It went really well.  Circumstances were awesome, right?  That's how we define good.  Paul goes on in Romans 8, 29 to define the good when he says this.  For those God foreknew, he also predestined, here it is, to be conformed to the image of his Son.  The good God can do in all things is to use all things to form you more into the likeness of Jesus.  That's the good.  God knows the plans and his plans are meant for good, to form you more into the likeness of Jesus.  And this definition changes a lot of things.  It changes our prayers.  Because I have a feeling that when we pray prayers, we want our definition of good to come to pass, right?  Think about it.  If God said yes to all the prayers you've been praying for the past few weeks, would your life be more comfortable or would God be more glorified?  God's glory is the good and is glorified as we look more like Jesus in the process.  So let me ask you, how might God be wanting to use the very thing you're going through to form you more into the likeness of Jesus?  He wants to make you more like Jesus through this.  And if you're finding yourself wanting relief from the pain, I want you to hear this word.  He's wanting to transform you through it.  And you're in really good company all throughout the scriptures.  He does this.  He doesn't just pluck people from their hard place.  He promises his presence to be with them in the hard place as they go through the hard things.  Remember Noah?  God didn't rescue Noah by stopping a flood.  He rescued Noah in the midst of the waves.  On a boat.  In fact, God shows his hand what he physically did in the Noah narrative.  Genesis chapter 6 verse 17 says this.  Ah, verse 16.  Chapter 7 verse 16 says this.  The animals going in were male and female of every living thing as God had commanded Noah.  Then the Lord shut him in.  Did you catch it?  God closed the door.  Am I the only one that thought that God only opened doors?  Maybe you're in the season and you're feeling like every single door continues to be shut.  I want to give you this word from Noah's life.  God didn't shut the door on Noah to keep him from the good plans he had.  He shut the door.  He closed the door on Noah to keep him from drowning on the other side.  God doesn't remove us from hardship.  He transforms us through it.  Remember Daniel in the lion's den?  He didn't save him by keeping him out of the pit.  He saved him with the beasts at his side.  Or how about his buddies, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego?  Remember them?  God didn't save them from the fire.  He saved them in the midst of the flames.  And we can learn something about faith and how to handle hardship from Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego's words.  Do you remember what their words were before walking into the fire?  They said this, we want you to know, O King, that our God is able to do anything.  Remember the speech they gave?  It's such a good speech.  And the next few words they said, but even if he doesn't, we want you to know, O King, that we will not bow down and worship the image of gold you have set up.  What they're saying is this, we want you to know our God can do absolutely anything, but even if.  Those two words are transformative.  Mike Foster said this, even if breeds faith.  And the thing that needs to be replaced is the words what if.  Have you been saying that in this season?  But what if.  What if breeds fear.  Even if breeds faith.  Because even if your what?  if comes to pass, God will use it for good to make you more like His Son.  He didn't rescue them from hard places.  He transformed them through it in the same reason.  He's not pulling all of us out of this hardship.  He's wanting to transform us through it.  So let me ask you again and hope and trust that you're seeking to find what God is saying to you in this moment.  How might God be wanting to use this, this season, that difficult relationship, anything you're going through, whatever comes to mind, how might God be wanting to use that very thing to form you more into the likeness of Jesus?  He'll do it.  He knows the plans.  His plans are meant for good.  They're not exempt from trial, but he'll use all of it.  to make you look more like Him, because guess what your family needs?  More of Him, and guess what God's plan for them is?  Maybe transforming you.  You wanna know God's plan for your neighborhood?  It's to reveal to them who He is, and guess who God might wanna use?  You.  It's not in you making perfect choices, it's you being conformed more into the image of His Son.  Let me tell you who Jesus is, who he is revealed through scripture and who he's specifically been revealed to me as in this season.  Jesus is calm in the storm.  Jesus is a prayer warrior.  Jesus is dependent upon the words of his heavenly father.  How about you?  I'll ask again, how might God be wanting to use this to form you more in the likeness of his son?  He'll do it.  All we got to do is pay attention to the right voice.  He's speaking.  He knows the plans and he'll use it all for good. ",
