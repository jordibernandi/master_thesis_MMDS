            "text": "Hey everybody, John here.  Obviously.  And I've just read an article in the New York Post, which probably you've seen, but in case you haven't, I'll put a link to it in the low bar.  It's about a bronze statue that's just been unveiled in New York City, and it's a life-size or slightly larger-than-life-size statue of a naked woman.  She is athletic-looking and of heroic proportions and nude, and has... snakes for hair.  so it's Medusa from Greek mythology except the mythology has been turned on.  its head turned upside down Medusa is holding the severed head of Perseus although it's in the description.  in the article it doesn't say Perseus or it doesn't say the hero.  it just says a man and in the other hand holding a sword.  now the mythology is Perseus the heroic.  the protagonist of the Greek mythology slays Medusa who is not a regular woman is a you know is a goddess or a semi-god who embodies the aspect of nature that is feminine and is petrifying and destructive to male nature.  you know like the men freeze under the gaze of the woman and all that stuff men are transfixed, men are turned to stone.  I mean, those are metaphors.  But anyway, this statue, bronze statue in New York City, is a nude, heroically proportioned woman, clearly being Medusa with the snakes for hair, and has severed, in her hand, a severed head of a man.  And I think this is actually perfection.  It is the perfect symbolic encapsulation of the present state of social discourse between men and women.  And the article says the statue sends a hashtag MeToo message.  Well, it does.  What is MeToo?  It's characterized mostly by its proponents as justice and all that kind of stuff, except that MeToo is a movement that bypasses justice, bypasses facts and courts and inquiry into evidence, and decides that a woman says something, therefore somebody shall be destroyed.  It is women's fiat control of the destruction or the dispossession of a person that they accuse.  Now, the public discourse around this says it's, oh, we're just about protecting people from abuse or from sexual assault or from sexual aggravation or harassment and so on.  But if that was the case, then there'd be an inquiry into the facts and then you'd be able to separate a true accusation from a false one.  That's not what it's about at all.  It's about being able to point your finger and destroy somebody regardless of what evidence does or does not exist.  And I think this statue is actually perfect because it sends a message.  It sends a message much deeper, more forcefully, and more clearly than any words could ever do, than any description could do.  The head in the hand of the heroic woman, that's not... perseus and it's not a god representing some dark aspect of humanity.  that's just a man and if you're a man that's you.  uh so uh i'm delighted that this statue is here and and do not be fooled when you see the picture when you see this statue do not be fooled that this is like a A movie set of a dystopian science fiction movie, you know, based on a novel of feminist supremacy or subjugation of men, you know, made in the 1960s or 70s.  This is the present we're living in now, not a dystopian sci-fi movie.  This is actual reality and the statue is perfect.  Gentlemen, pay attention.  Can you get the message yet, or is it still too subtle?  Oh, and I'd just like to remind you all that what we live in is a patriarchy.  That is a world organized to advantage men and to suppress women.  Yeah, that's what it is.  Thanks for watching.  Thanks for helping support my channel through Patreon and Subscribestar down below.  And as always, have a lovely, lovely day. ",
