They're not going to sell it because they're under the delusion that Bitcoin is going to be money one day.  Well, it's never going to be money.  Money doesn't fit the very definition of money.  Money needs to be a commodity.  It needs to have actual value unto itself, not just a use as a medium of exchange.  Now, in America today, in most of the world, nobody actually uses money.  We use currency, which is a money substitute.  And there are two types of currency.  There's legitimate currency where you have paper that is issued but backed by real money, which is what the Federal Reserve used to issue in the United States.  And then you have fiat currency, which is paper money backed by nothing, which is what we have now.  Well, Bitcoin is like a fiat digital currency.  It's backed by nothing, except it doesn't even have legal tender status.  So it's worse than traditional fiat currencies.  And people who are buying it are going to wake up one day and they're just going to be a bag holder. ",
