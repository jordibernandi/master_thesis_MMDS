            "text": "Well, thanks so much, Rebecca.  The Shelby County Environmental Court is in some ways really a misnomer.  You think of the term court.  You think that there will be witnesses sworn in on the stand and that they'll give testimony under oath, that that testimony will be recorded, that those recordings will go into a court file that you can access, and that there will ultimately be findings of fact and conclusions of law that determine your case so that you can appeal it if you don't agree with the order.  None of that exists in the Shelby County Environmental Court.  What it is is a specialized court that originally served a function that addressed what I think we can all agree is a legitimate problem, which is addressing blight by way of vacant and abandoned properties, many of which had out-of-town owners.  And having streamlined processes in place to deal with those vacant and abandoned properties was this original intention of a specialized court.  Well, like so many instances where we see abuses of depriving people of due process at the hands of the government, the original intention and what it ultimately became, which is a place where people living in their homes that aren't abandoned, where they have had a family history for years, get caught up in this essentially black hole of a courtroom.

The repairs took a long time, and she ultimately ended up being sued in this environmental court.  Well, in some ways, what happened... And this, by the way, was initiated nearly a decade ago.  So what happened in that time is in some ways a mystery because there were not oftentimes findings of fact or conclusions of law or sworn testimony.  It became a sort of black box.  But what we do know is that she was ultimately deprived of a home that she owned outright.  They took her home, threw her belongings in the street, and they issued a warrant for her arrest so that she was essentially a fugitive from justice, all without due process.  So now... Ms.  Holmberg was experiencing not only the loss of the property rights and her most important possession, her home, but also potentially her liberty at the threat of being jailed, all stemming from this tree falling and being caught in a courtroom that didn't allow her to have those due process protections that you would normally associate with a court.

I mean, you know how hard it is to get things done with a house, even under the best of circumstances, let alone, you know, Ms.  Holmberg had health issues.  She has suffered two strokes since this all got underway.  And it's been difficult to meet these sort of changing goalposts that the environmental court sets.  So there were those efforts, but again, part of it legally is always going to be somewhat of a mystery because the jackets, as they call them, which are essentially court files that they normally maintain, are often missing or non-existent for people who end up in environmental court.

And again, if it had ended there, you and I wouldn't be having this conversation now.  But in 2016... And you'll note 2016 is after they filed the lawsuit against Ms.  Holmberg in this court.  So there was really no authority to begin with there.  In 2016 is when the state legislature said that you can go after occupied homes as part of this system.  And so suddenly you have cities like Memphis with a real blight program, a real blight problem, but who can now have occupied homeowners who haven't left their house to just rot, are caught up in it.
