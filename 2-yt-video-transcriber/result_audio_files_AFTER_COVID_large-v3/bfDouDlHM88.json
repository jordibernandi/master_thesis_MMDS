Trump is going to remain the President of the United States.  Do you believe that?  This is truly dangerous.  Many of these pastors are radicalizing their base, and it's downright scary.  Even with Trump out of office, this won't just go away.  This is what I've been pushing back against with my channel, conference organization, rallies, and public speaking events for over four years now.  When I started doing this full-time in 2016, it's amazing how often people would ask me why I'm still talking about atheism, religion, and science, and they'd say things like, \"'This conversation's been had, and we already  won.'\".  And four years from now, they'll probably be saying the same thing.  Meanwhile, these pastors will continue to grow their following and their political influence, and I'll continue to be here pushing back.  My videos will always be free, but if you appreciate what I'm doing and you want to help me reach more people, you can make a per-video pledge on patreon.com slash holykoolaid, or make a one-time credit card donation through PayPal.  And if you want to directly help me upgrade a specific piece of gear, I have an Amazon wishlist linked below.  Thank you guys so much for your ongoing support.  I've got work to do, but as always, dare to be curious, but don't drink the Kool-Aid. ",
