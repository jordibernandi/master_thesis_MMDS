Even though like, I don't know, every major news media outlet has a thousand articles on Brie Larson.  Apparently it's different when you're a YouTuber. ",

So let's quickly have a flick through some of the thumbnails and the titles.  So Brie Larson attacks me, we must strike back.  Brie Larson fired from Captain Marvel and failing the YouTube channel.  Brie Larson YouTube channel collapses.  Brie Larson is ugly.  Captain Marvel actress goes fishing for compliments.  Brie Larson joins YouTube.  She's totally just like us, except better.  Avengers cast savagely roast Brie Larson and her lies.  Brie Larson totally doesn't hate white men.  So what we're going to do in this video is talk about why reactionaries and anti-SJW types really hate Brie Larson and why they have this real focus on her as opposed to other people.  It's clearly good for generating traffic and views to their channel but their obsession of her is really really weird.  I don't know if it's quite dangerous yet but of course you don't want legions of incels being, I guess, incentivized to harass her from all these reactionary channels.  And you can see even on her first YouTube upload, it's been brigaded by loads of these right-wing types.

If you want to support me financially, check out my Patreon in the description and also come join my Discord and my subreddit and follow me on social media at TheCavanacles.  So if you go on Brie Larson's YouTube channel, she has over 450,000 subscribers.  But if you go on her first video, which now has 2.2 million views, it has 192K likes and 141K dislikes.  Now, this is actually a really high dislike ratio, especially for someone like this just making the introduction to their channel.  And most of the comments, if you go and have a look, are just troll comments from reactionary channels brigading her channel.  Now let's just have a quick look at what she says in the video.  It's really not a big deal.  Definitely not worthy of 141k dislikes.  Hi, I'm Brie Larson. ",

YouTube has been a place that I have learned so much, whether it's been like how to use my printer or it's been watching like how to be a considerate activist.  This is like the place to talk about things that are important and that matter.  It doesn't mean that there isn't also silly content, that there's ways for me to express myself personally, but there will also be deep conversations, anti-racist rhetoric, inclusive content.  So with all that said, the following video is just me getting warmed up and feeling this out and getting to talk with a lot of really brilliant, awesome creators.  So, here it is. ",

            "text": "So earlier this week, USC Annenberg's Inclusive Initiative released findings that 67% of the top critics reviewing the 100 highest-grossing movies in 2017 were white males.  Less than a quarter were white women, and less than 10% were unrepresented men.  only 2.5% of those top critics were women of color.  So you're probably thinking right now, like, wow, that super doesn't represent the country that I live in, and that's because that's true.  This is a huge disconnect from the US population breakdown of 30% white men, 30% white women, 20% men of color, and 20% women of color.  On top of all of this, Am I saying that I hate white dudes?  No, I'm not.  But what I am saying is, is that you make a movie that is a love letter to women of color.  There is an insanely low chance.  a woman of color will have the chance to see your movie and review your movie.  Other people besides white dudes like Star Wars and would love the opportunity to do a set visit.  And I'm also saying I don't hate white dudes.  I'm just saying we need to be conscious of our bias and do our part to make sure that everyone is in the room.  Good reviews out of festivals give small independent films a fighting chance to be bought and seen.  Good reviews help films gross money.  Good reviews slingshot films into awards contenders.  A good review can change your life.  It changed mine.  We are expanding to make films that better reflect the people that buy movie tickets.  But they are not allowed enough chances to read public discourse on these films by the people that these films were made for.  I do not need a 40-year-old white dude to tell me what didn't work for him about A Wrinkle in Time.  It wasn't made for him.  I want to know what that film meant to women of color, to biracial women, to teen women of color, to teens that are biracial.  And for the third time, I don't hate white dudes. ",

            "text": "As a white guy watching that clip, I don't have any problem with it.  I guess what some people, maybe who are rational, took it as is no white man's criticism of any film is relevant unless it was made for a white man.  And I don't think that's what she was saying.  I think she has clarified later.  that's not exactly what she was saying.  But her main point is, in the film industry, you have a lot of different films, and I guess it's getting more diverse, but 67% of critics in America who reviewed the top 10 blockbusters are white men, which is disproportionate to America having about a 30% population of white men.  So when you make a film about the experience of black women, of biracial women, all these different groups who are underrepresented, it would be nice if more of the critics reviewing this stuff actually had a connection to the film and the film was, I guess, either catered towards them or made about similar experiences they might have in life.  because, yes, white men are obviously the most privileged in Western society.  If you're making a film about, I don't know, a poor black single mother or, you know, there's various different films about the black struggle in America historically or contemporary films, anything like that, you would like a wider range of voices.  You wouldn't just want white men dominating the conversation around that.  And like they also go on to say, reviews affect what films get picked up by studios.  So you've wouldn't just want white men dictating what films get picked up and what films will not get picked up.  It's a totally fair point in my opinion and you definitely have to have some sort of prejudice and you'd have to be some sort of bigot to really take that as an affront to white men.  I honestly really don't understand white men who can't take any criticism of white men.  I think it also explains why Jordan Peterson is so popular, saying that you need this hierarchy which has been in place for thousands of years, you need men at the top, and in Western society that is white men, because that's the way society's always worked, something about lobsters, blah blah blah.  But let's go into how the anti-SJWs reacted back in the day.  Of course, we have to turn to the two Jeremy twins, Jeremy from The Quartering and Jeremy from Geeks and Gamers, two of the more stupid reactionaries I always like to dunk on.  But they just have such horrible takes all the time that are so easy.  Sometimes it feels a little cruel because they're clearly not intellectually capable of digesting these things.  They just see someone with progressive politics saying something about white men and then they all freak out. ",

And I like what anti-SOWs like to do is not address the actual point she was making.  So what do those guys think?  that 67% of film critics for the top 10 blockbusters in the year she made those comments were all white men, even though that's not proportional to the population.  Do you wanna dig a bit deeper into the social causes, why that might be, the reasons with patriarchy, with institutional racism and biases, why there aren't more diverse film critics, or do you just wanna make some really lazy video where you just criticize her for having woke politics and that she is a feminist, but don't address any point she is making, or not even try and understand the point she was making, even if you don't particularly like the comment that she doesn't care about the opinions of 40-year-old white dudes.  Now, to go on a bit of a tangent, just to go on his personal opinion, he seems to think Brie Larson is a really, really bad person, but I don't really see any evidence for that apart from these comments.  And his obsession and his comments seem a bit unhinged.  And it goes to my point that these reactionaries have real deep-seated, bigoted, and prejudiced views, where someone just saying something like, let's diversify film critics, sets them off like this.

She's not saying, you know, some amazing stuff you'd hear from communists or Marxists about global institutional racism and colonialism and Western supremacy and white supremacy.  It's a pretty simple point.  I just want the film critics to represent the population and it's quite hard being a woman in the film industry and it's even harder if you're a woman from a minority.  I don't understand why that is so controversial when it's true.  So let's get into the real obsessive with Brie Larson quarter pounder.

            "text": "This comment also plays into what I feel a lot of anti-SJWs and reactionaries believe, that white men are somehow persecuted, criticising white men dominating an industry or acting or filmmaking.  If you change that around to black or women, that would be controversial.  Well, that would be controversial because they're not in a position of power.  The society they live in is not controlled by that group.  Western society is controlled by white men.  Most industries are dominated by white men.  White men have the power to criticise white men disproportionately.  making up the percentage of anything isn't racist it's just true and it stems from our racist system where we are very over represented in lots of different things and you can't just explain that away that these different groups who aren't represented just chose not to go for those specific industries and you guys are totally obsessed with her And it comes from two different places.  Like I said, I believe most anti-SJW and reactionary channels are very bigoted.  So simply because a superhero who's a white woman saying she doesn't want to hear the opinion of white men like you about films that aren't catered to you, drives you absolutely insane because you deny basic prejudices in society exist.  You get angry when anyone tries to advocate against the status quo.  Anyone tries to advocate for people who might not have as big a platform as they do, like Brie Larson has been doing with her platform.  And someone made a good comment on one of my other videos saying, you guys are the status quo warriors, because you are, you don't want anything to change, and like I said earlier, you don't engage with the arguments she's actually making, which are very sound and make sense, you just criticise her for being woke.  and you criticize and misconstrue one little thing she says and try and paint her as a racist for talking about white men being dominant in certain industries.  But then it also plays into the other side that these guys are basically content farms in a lot of ways.  The Quarter Inn uploads so much stuff and it's super lazy videos in the sense that he doesn't really make an argument.  He doesn't really make too many sweeping statements, he just reads an article and reads everyone else's tweets.  Geeks and Gamers does the exact same thing.  It's lazy, but their click baitiness and picking on people, or even making people targets to keep picking on, gets them views, gets them money, and YouTube's algorithm like it as well.  So hopefully this explained a bit why they're obsessed with Brie Larson.  They've made so many videos on her about so many different things.  I, of course, can't cover it all, but it all stems from this comment about white men.  Now, if you liked the video, please like, maybe share, maybe subscribe to the channel.
