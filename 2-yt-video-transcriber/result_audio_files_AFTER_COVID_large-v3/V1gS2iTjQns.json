            "text": "I just want to be clear in terms of the definition of people dying of COVID.  So the case definition is very simplistic.  It means at the time of death, it was a COVID positive diagnosis.  So that means that if you were... in hospice and had already been given a few weeks to live, and then you also were found to have COVID, that would be counted as a COVID death.  It means that technically, even if you died of a clear alternate cause, but you had COVID at the same time, it's still listed as a COVID death.  So everyone who's listed as a COVID death doesn't know that that was the cause of the death, but they had COVID at the time of death.  I hope that's helpful.  Are you on drugs or alcohol?  No sir.  Do you take drugs or alcohol?  What is drugs?  What is drugs?  What is drugs?  What is drugs?  What is drugs?  Drop the bass, kitty. ",
