            "text": "No, I do not think that it is all that unreasonable that mathematics is effective in the natural sciences, because what is mathematics about?  It is a way to describe patterns, to describe regularities, and that's exactly what we do in the natural sciences.  So there is, of course, an underlying question here, which is, why is the universe such that there are patterns for us to discover to begin with?  And I think that that's a question which just falls outside of science.  So that in and by itself is not a question that belongs into my discipline.  Personally, I think that the more interesting question is, why is mathematics so inefficient in the other sciences?  Like if you look at social sciences, for example, or maybe also at neurobiology and related disciplines, there's very little mathematics that is actually being used.  I mean, I say that as a theoretical physicist.  So in physics, all our theories are mathematical.  But that's not the case in other disciplines, which brings up the question whether that is a property of nature.  Is there just a limit to what we can do with mathematics?  Or is it just a case of we have not yet found the right mathematics? ",

If you're a reductionist, then you have everything.  and neurobiology composed of the physics, and you have sort of a factorial relationship among all these probabilistic things.  You have just a hugely unwieldy universe to apply mathematics.  But I think there's a deeper question.  And I agree with you that mathematics is a way to describe patterns.  That's correct.  But the question comes up, why are the patterns in nature you're putting aside?  OK, but this is an intermediary question, is that why are the patterns in nature such that many of them have a unity of specificity?  And they're not like the square root of 2 or pi that can go on forever, but whether it's... Newton's inverse square law or whether it's the Maxwell's equations or Einstein's general relativity, these are kind of whole number relationships and are whole relationships that describe the patterns.  So it's not a question that there are patterns, but there are patterns that are susceptible to very simple mathematics.  I find that unusual or disturbing. ",

I don't think that that is likely to be the case.  I think that these are questions that mathematics can very well answer.  We just have not found the answer.  On the other hand, if you think about the many parameter systems like human beings or societies and so on, this creates a big problem for the scientific method and the use of mathematics.  Because it's just not possible to test such a system under sufficiently many circumstances. ",

If you can use mathematics, that would give you maybe more certainty in your predictability or something.  But that doesn't mean if you can't use mathematics like an art appreciation or something, that that makes it less real or you're less able to get at some kind of truths.  I think the question of patterns, though, in the deep physical reality is still a problem to me.  Because I don't know why any of the fundamental aspects of reality should submit themselves to simple mathematics unless there was some deeper kind of relationship, which is why the unreasonable effect of this resonates with me.

We could discover that Einstein's general relativity had 50 different terms like the standard model or something.  And then it still wouldn't be perfect.  It would be perfect up to 10 digits, but it wouldn't be perfect beyond that unless you extended it.  So that would describe a pattern in mathematics, but it would be extremely unwieldy.

There are, for example, the Brown sticker theories.  That's one example where you have additional parameters that modify Einstein's equations.  It's just that for all we currently know, those parameters are either zero or they are so small that the effects are not observable.  For all we currently know, these additional terms are the parameters in front of them are either zero or they are very small.  And why that is so, we don't know, but it is something that we can just experimentally test.  So I'm afraid that I see myself not so much in the business of trying to understand why those laws are the specific laws that describe the universe, but more concerned with the question, does it work?  And for me, if you can measure constant and you find it to be negligibly small, that's all fine.  That's how science works. ",
