            "text": "This video was brought to you by the lovely members of my Patreon.  So let's talk about Jeffree Star.  Now, this is not the first time I've actually talked about Jeffree Star.  I made a video a couple of years ago when a lot of people were pulling up his old racist videos.  In that video, basically, I made the argument that we really can't judge people's current feelings about racism based on these 10-year-old videos.  I also made the argument that, you know, MySpace was a different time because it truly was.  I mean, it was definitely a time where lots of choices were made.  we should actually interrogate him about how he currently feels.  Basically, I made the argument that if the only black people in Jeffree Star's life are there to make him money, that's not necessarily evidence that he's not a racist, right?  Now, hearing that, y'all should be able to see that I gave him a lot of leeway.  I cut him a lot of slack.  Now, what some of you guys might not know from just watching that video is that after I posted that video, Jeffree Star filed a copyright claim against me.  It was one of the few times where I've had a video literally just yanked off of YouTube.  It was one of the most upsetting experiences I've ever had on YouTube, right?  And of course I disputed it.  The video got reinstated.  Everything was copacetic and cool.  But Jeffree Star, even with me giving him a very light criticism where I defended him low key, still, still, try to get my YouTube channel deleted.  So I'll be honest, all the leeway that I gave him, I almost immediately regretted it because he did not deserve it.  So in this video, I'm definitely going to be speaking really bluntly.  Now we know that we're not a drama channel over here.  This is not a drama channel.  We're not here to spill tea or dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.  If I have conversations like this on my channel, it's because I do believe there is a larger message here, but I wanna make it really clear that I'm not here to mince words.  So I want to start out by saying that I've known a lot of people like Jeffree Star, people who believe that everyone they interact with is jealous or bitter or doesn't like them.  You know, people who have enemies everywhere, people who have this like revolving door of friends that never stick around or leave as quickly as they came.  Like, I've known so many people like this.  And when you get closer to people like that, you kind of start to understand that it's not that everyone hates them and everyone's bitter and no one can stand them.  It's more that they're just toxic people.  People like Jeffrey really require praise, right?  And whenever somebody goes just a little bit off script, a little bit off script they've got to either bump them off or butter them up to the point where they're back on the script.  do you know what i mean?  and i think we saw that with a couple of people.  i mean we saw that with rich lux who used to openly criticize jeffree star but is now seemingly on his payroll right.  and again we're not a drama channel.  we're not here to talk about all the tea but you guys can tell i i do watch.  Now listen, I want to give people credit where credit is due.  Jeffree Star, even though he's been accused of being a terrible racist, has been posting a lot about Black Lives Matter.  He's been posting about George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and I think that that is actually a really great thing.  But like a lot of these companies who have come out and started to say these really positive things about Black Lives Matter, there have been some people who have decided to take this opportunity to call them out for their own anti-blackness.  So in my first video, I basically say that we can't really judge Jeffrey based on what he did 10 years ago.  We have to judge him based on what he does today.  Well, recently, a person named Tab, who is a former friend of Jeffree Star, released this video where he goes into detail about some of the racist things that Jeffree Star said in his earshot. ",

So we were all figuring out what we were going to do for the night.  And I had stepped outside on the patio and Jeffrey told me, you know, like, wow, I can't believe.  she canceled the show and continued to say a very derogatory word towards Jewish people.  It starts with a K. I'm not going to repeat the word, but that's what he said.  And when we went to the store, ",

            "text": "so jeffrey likes to point out that a lot of people who call him out are just these fame hungry people looking for likes shares and views and i'll be completely honest and say that i think that's very very true to some degree.  there are a lot of people who make jeffree star content where They're just sort of, you know, posturing and being so offended and, you know, doing all of this stuff.  that's just so over the top to talk about Jeffree Star.  Honestly, in a lot of cases doing things that are kind of innocuous, right?  But that all being said, Tab is not a person who is looking for social media followers.  And I watched the entire video and I definitely got the impression that Tab was just the sort of person who wanted to come on here, say those things and leave.  He's not looking for subscribers.  He's not looking for clout.  He's not looking for any of that.  So I tend to find what he says to be very credible.  I don't want to believe that, you know, Jeffree Star is a terrible racist, but how many times do we have to hear this story over and over and over again?  until it becomes true.  So Tab came out and had those conversations, but also as a reaction to Jeffree Star posting more Black Lives Matter content, a micro influencer named Cameron Lester decided to share his experience working with Jeffree Star.  Now Cameron has been in several promotional photo shoots for Jeffree Star's cosmetics and he's partied with Jeffree.  He considers himself to have been a friend to Jeffree Star and he made a video recently detailing why he no longer supports him. ",

He's like, she doesn't deserve a fucking spot on my platform.  And so I was just like, whatever.  It wasn't personally towards me.  So I was uncomfortable, but I just was like, whatever.

So I was going hard for him on Twitter because I'm getting backlash, but he would never defend up for me.  So I was really hurt. ",

            "text": "Now, full disclosure, I've met Cameron and I think that he is an absolutely lovely young man, but I gotta be honest, I really don't know what he was expecting.  I don't really take any pleasure in essentially saying I told you so, but I don't know what Cameron was expecting.  And to some degree, I know he was expecting more views, I know he was expecting more subscribers, but I gotta be real with you guys.  Cameron Lester worked with Jeffree Star because Jeffree has a massive platform.  And if Cameron worked with Jeffree, that obviously would mean a lot to his career.  Jeffree Star has 18 million subscribers on YouTube, and it seems like no conversations about his former or current racism are ever going to significantly hurt his platform.  And I'll be honest with you guys, it has been really interesting for me to observe the way that Jeffree Star has been handled and seen and still celebrated.  Now, in this video, he talks a lot about feeling tokenized, feeling like he is going out and defending Jeffree Star and then being called a coon and being called all of these terrible things because he's defending somebody who a lot of people said was a racist right and how he didn't feel like that was reciprocated how he didn't feel like his labor in defense of his white friend who was accused of racism was not reciprocated right.  i think that isolation has opened a lot of people's eyes to the energy that they spend and whether or not it was productive and good and useful for them.  And when I look at the situation, I look at somebody who spent a really huge amount of emotional energy defending somebody who, frankly, we warned you about.  What I call Jeffree Star out, a lot of people's reaction to that was to tell me to be patient and to be educational and to help them out, understand.  And, you know, honestly.  When he claimed my video, I kind of knew that he wasn't the kind of person who would listen to that.  When it comes to racism, there are definitely people who are ignorant.  There are definitely people who don't know.  no better, right?  But one of the sort of sad realizations I've had is that there are people who know better and know that they're being racist and know that they're saying really bad things and they just don't care.  Furthermore, there are people who know that they can't say certain things publicly, so they will only say them privately amongst friends and amongst people who they know they won't get called out for saying those things.  Personally, I've learned a lot in isolation, and one of the things that I'm constantly thinking about now is who I give my energy to.  recently finished this really amazing book called why i'm no longer talking to white people.  you can't really see it about race.  it's by renny edo lodge and it's a really amazing book.  it's really vital i think for anyone who's trying to understand why so many of these conversations are frustrating.  And I wanted to read a passage from it because it really made me think a bit about this whole Cameron Lester situation.  This is part of the chapter about race and class.  She writes, so although class and race are inextricably connected for people of color, moving or changing class can be a tantalizing prospect.  Children of immigrants are often assured by well-meaning parents that educational access to the middle class can absolve them from racism.  we are told to work hard go to a good university and get a good job.  we can't berate our parents for wanting us to have a better life and better chances than they did.  but after i graduated i quickly realized that social mobility was not going to save me And I thought that that was a little bit relevant here because it's almost like Cameron saw the racism and was like, okay, but not me though.  You know, okay, maybe he did say this about this person, but like, not me though.  It's really seductive to a lot of black people to believe that you're going to be able to put yourself in a position if you just walk and act and talk the right way.  Racism is something that you're not going to experience.  But, you know, for me, again, I don't take pleasure in saying I told you so, but I don't know how Cam looked at Jeffree Star and all the merriest accusations of racism and didn't think it would happen to him.  I don't understand that.  I do not get that, right?  For me, the lesson in all of this is, again, to really think about where you're spending your energy.  After all of that, Cameron still has under 100,000 subscribers.  I think his most recent video has under 2000 views.  He put himself all the way out there, exhausted himself, got attacked on Twitter, put himself into a position where he's potentially going to be seen less favorably by other black influencers.  All for nothing.  All for nothing.  And I'm not saying it would have been worth it if he got something out of it.  But I just want to point out the little that was gained from it all.  Because at the end of the day, I do think that that stands... as evidence that this is not productive for you.  This is not helpful for you.  So at the end of the day, I again think that this was a big lesson for Cameron.  I think that he is going to really come out of this with more awareness.  And I think that's a great thing.  I think that in this time in quarantine, I think this is a Really important time to hunker down and to gain more awareness.  I think that Cameron fell down the trap that a lot of us fall through, a lot of Black people fall through.  We believe that it's just not going to happen to us if we act the right way.  And I'm glad that he was able to see through it and to call it out.  And I hope he moves forward, not backwards.  There have been a couple of people who have called out Jeffree Star only to get some PR randomly.  And I just, that's, we really hate to see it.  We really, really, we really do hate to see it.  So anyway, I think I've said all I want to say about this.  If you have anything to add, I would love to hear it in the comment box below.  I'm curious for the black folk watching this right now.  Would you ever work for Jeffree Star?  Would you ever collaborate with Jeffree Star?  Would it be worth selling your soul?  Let me know.  I'll talk to you guys next time.  Bye. ",
