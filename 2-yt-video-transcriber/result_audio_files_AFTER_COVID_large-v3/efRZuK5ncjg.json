            "text": "Lord, we honor you today as the only one.  Lord, when we are feeling alone and in despair, we lean on the abiding presence of Jehovah Shammah, the Lord who is here, the Lord who is present.  Lord, when we need direction, we lean on the abiding presence of Jehovah Rohi, the Lord, our shepherd.  And Lord, when we are confronted by infirmity and sickness, we lean on the abiding presence of Yehovah Rofi, the Lord our healer.  And Lord, when we are in need of provision, we lean on the everlasting abiding presence of Yehovah Jireh, our Jehovah Jireh, the Lord our provider.  But Lord, when it comes to your presence your salvation we lean upon Yehovah Yeshua our Messiah our King and we lift you up today.  Lord God I thank you that you hear our prayers today.  I thank you Lord that heaven is awakened by the praise of Kim Clement by the praise of Hannah and Miranda the praise of Doobie and Mr.  Fowle the praise of Charlie the praise of Sunil the praise of Joe the praise of every person watching.  lift up your hands everybody.  heaven is listening to you right now.  heaven is hearing you right now and say his name.  say his name hallelujah.  come on worship the Lord.  come on and we will not take away from the very words that you said Lord God in your word.  For there is an inherent blasphemy when one seeks to add to the words of Christ in his dying moments, declaring, it is finished.  There is no more work to be done, it is finished.  There is no more salvation to be offered, it is finished.  There is no more healing or blood to be required from the man's hands.  for it is finished the work that was done on the cross and when Christ cried out as the smitten lamb it is finished.  Lord from that smitten side flow rivers of everlasting life.  from that smitten side of Christ Flow the rivers of life and streams of joy.  We shall drink from the wells of salvation.  We will drink with joy from the wells of salvation today.  Speak to us, Lord, and remove confusion.  Speak to us, Lord, and remove loneliness and depression.  Speak one word, Lord God, and paralysis is gone.  speak just one word god and our dead daughters and sons shall come to life.  our dead daughters and sons shall come to life.  lord god you are not a respecter of persons.  lord if you could do it for the centurion you can do it for us.  if you could do it for abram isaac and jacob you can do it for us.  you alone lord god do we praise today.  come on give me praise hallelujah.  And so, Lord, with that powerful prayer that I brought before you, may you see the hands of the people that will not come empty-handed to you.  Their mouths have not been empty.  They have had praise to sing to you and prayers to pray to you.  But, Lord God, we also come to you with our hands filled with offerings to you today.  Because that's what you instigated for us, initiated at least, for us to be blessed.  I'm praying today that some of the wells that you promised would flourish, would begin to flourish in the September, October, November season.  I pray Lord God some of the things that you've revealed to us for the sake of the prosperity of your people.  that Lord those wells would spring up.  we have prophesied to the wells.  we have sung to the wells.  open our eyes that we may see where the wells are that you may bring prosperity in this season.  that is the prayer of this prophet into this generation.  that Lord we will not go with lack.  if you said to David the Lord is my shepherd i shall not lack i shall not want.  then lord in this with these people there shall be no lack.  we bless you and praise you lord as our god the provider and the source of supply el shaddai.  we bless you today amen.
