            "text": "The corporate media has failed us.  It's time to build something new.  Newspapers run as playthings for right-wing billionaires, whip up bigotry against minorities, refugees, migrants, Muslims, trans people, instead of holding the rich and powerful to account for the problems and injustices that they cause.  Broadcasters fail to challenge and scrutinise the government.  Thank you so much.  And create monsters who peddle and feed off fear and hatred.  And with the Tories' friends lined up to run the BBC and Ofcom, our media ecosystem is only going to get dragged ever further to the right.  That's why we need your help.  I'm launching a new video channel to offer an alternative.  To challenge the powerful and give a voice to the marginalised.  To expose injustice.  To create a platform for alternatives.  Whether it be how we run our society or our economy or how we fight the existential threat of the climate emergency.  to fight the far right without fear or compromise.  And this isn't going to be an echo chamber.  We are going to talk to, debate with, challenge people.  we couldn't disagree with more and go to the very heart of the opposition.  And if this sounds a little bit dry, we're going to have a laugh as well, I promise.  Why are you fighting back?  Hello?  Hello?  But we can't do this without you.  I need to hire an incredible team.  Videographers, producers, editors, all on a union wage.  And the more money that we raise, the more powerful and hard-hitting content we can produce, and the more we can challenge the right-wing grip on the media.  It won't be funded by corporations or billionaires.  It can only be funded by you.  And you're going to be involved every step of the way.  You're going to help decide what we talk about, what questions we ask, who we talk to, what issues we champion.  On my old YouTube channel, we had hundreds of thousands of shares and millions of views.  But unfortunately, the Guardian cut it.  It's over.  But it's going to come back bigger and better and independent and global in reach.  Every Sunday I'm going to host a new politics show.  It's going to have guests from Britain, the United States and all over the world.  Politicians, campaigners, economists, experts, people from the grassroots.  Voices who you wouldn't otherwise hear from in the mainstream media, in newspapers, on television.  And as well as the Sunday shows, we're going to do mini documentaries on the big issues of our time, interviews with voices that we all need to hear from.  If you want to challenge the right-wing grip on our broken media landscape, if you want to challenge the status quo, if you want to reach as many people as possible with an alternative, then please support this channel.  Please give whatever you can by clicking on the Patreon link and help build the media that we all deserve. ",
