And they believe that Jesus, the eternal God, is a created being.  They believe that God had sex with a mother and they had baby Jesus.  born to them as a god in heaven.  This thing is so polluted and convoluted.  It is idolatry of the rankest kind.  It is polytheism of the worst kind.  There's millions of gods all over everywhere.  It is deviant in the sense that it has all these sexual overtones.  And that ought to be clear to anybody who's got his eyes wide open because Joseph Smith's big deal was polygamy.  And, of course, recently the Mormons have tried to back away from that.  Now, you have to understand this about Mormonism.  Mormonism believes the Bible is corrupt.  by their own statements.  The Bible is corrupt.  The Bible is filled with error.  The Bible is not trustworthy.  And the Bible has to be corrected.  And the correct interpretation of the Bible comes through all the writings of Joseph Smith and the Pearl of Great Price, the doctrines and covenants, all of that kind of stuff is designed to correct the Bible and give added revelation.  So what you have is a denial then of the Trinity.  They don't believe in a Trinity.  A denial of the nature of God as the eternal one.  A denial of the person of Jesus Christ as the eternal Son of God.  There's even a denial of the Holy Spirit, the biblical teaching of the Holy Spirit.  Denial of the veracity and truthfulness of the Bible.  And then you add to this this where you want to have multiple wives and end up on a planet somewhere making spiritual children forever, and you can see that there's some really perverse things at the core of this.  And the reason I'm saying that, because I know the question was about evangelizing them, I think you have to understand that you're snatching a branch out of the burning.  This is a very, very, very pagan religious system.  They have managed to do enough public relations to convince people, that we ought to accept them as Christians.  They even talk about salvation by grace.  Now, you've got to understand what they're saying.  They believe in three heavens, for example.  So all of their theology is skewed.  All of it is warped.  So when they talk about a salvation by grace, they're talking about getting you into that place that first heaven where you're single, but if you want to get to the big heaven, you earn your way there.

They can't interpret any of it.  The presiding president apostle is, he has the final say on what is true.  So all they can do is affirm these things.  And they came to meet with me, invited me to Brigham Young, invited me, they wanted me to come into the city, they wanted me to talk to the faculty, talk to the students.  I tried to be as gracious as I could.  I said, you've got a different God, a different Christ, a different gospel, different source material, and you've got a false religion.  What am I going to gain by going there and having you pat me on the back like I'm some kind of a co-belligerent here?  So I have not gone, and I've continued to correspond with these people.  But to me, this is a deeply insidious issue.  Now, what do you do to evangelize these people?  First, you realize there are two things you've got to say to a Mormon.  One is this.  The Bible is the Word of God, and the Bible alone is the Word of God.  It's very sophisticated.  It's very clever.  It's not human, but it's not from God.  There are so many lies that have been exposed in Mormonism.  Joseph Smith supposedly translated some of those documents that he wrote from some language.  Well, they now know that language didn't exist.  He said that he was translating something from Egyptian.  They found those documents.  They're in museums now.  And his translation has nothing to do with what was said in the original.  There are just so many lies.  It was fraud from the beginning.  So I think you have to understand the seriousness of this.

We talk for about half an hour.  We just engage in a conversation.  And I told them, my struggle is if you started with this, would you ever come up with your belief system?  And I said, okay, so you believe that God has a father and that that father has a father and he has a father.  So there's a great-grandfather God, great-great-great-grandfather God, right?

He's somewhere, but we're not worried about him.  And I go, okay.  And they all became God, like they weren't God to begin with.  No, they weren't God to begin with.  They became God.

They're like, no, we're sons of God.  And I go, but you believe that you're eternal.  I go, so were you eternally sons of God?  He goes, no, eternally we were just some sort of matter, and then at some point we're given a soul, and then we're given a body, and then we're going to become like God is now.  And I said, gosh, that's so hard to get from this book.  I go, if I just read this book, I would think that God was eternal, that there's just one God that's always been, and that he didn't change, that he was the same yesterday, today, and forever, that he always was God, and there's just one.  I mean, I would just naturally, I don't know how you can make it any clearer than And I said, so that's my struggle with this.

I said, because you believe they were cursed by God, right?  He goes, yeah, that was the mark of God's curse was their black skin.  And I said, okay, well now, how about me?  I said, I'm not black.  I mean, in summer I get pretty dark.  But just honestly, I go, seriously, I go, what shade of black?  And they said, well, any shade.  I said, so the whiter you are, you know, the more pure, he goes, yeah, any color showed that there was some of that in your background and showed that you were part of those who received this curse from God.  And I said, and isn't it strange to you that that ban was lifted in 1979, you know, after the, they're like, no, it makes perfect sense to me.  And I go, I go, that's, see, I go, I can't get that.  I can't get that from here.  Like, again, they go, no, you can make it.  I said, I can't get your Book of Mormon and mixing this together.  He goes, oh, yeah, you can if you could see the big picture.  We went into all different issues.  I even had my daughter.  I said, you know, honey, you've got to come listen to this.  Because I wanted her.  I wanted her to learn.  I go, I want you to understand.  And we're going back and forth.  I go, here's my problem is I would never just read this and then put it down and go, okay, I need to become God.  I need to, you know, go in this succession and everything else.  I would just say, no, there's this creator who just made me, and I just bow down to him.  I just worship him and this Jesus.  It's all about him, and I'm not going to become like him one day, you know.  There'll be, you know, this sense in which I'm given a new body in this.  But I wouldn't come up with this whole theology if I started with this.  Sure, you can take this verse here and this verse here and mix it all and create this theology, but you'd never if you started this way.  It was no different than some Jehovah's Witnesses that came to my tour.  And when they were, I go, here's my struggle.  I go, again, and you guys, I go, man, I like you guys.  I'm trying to, I'm not trying to be facetious here or whatever else.  I'm just trying to understand how you think.  I go, because you guys are teaching that Jesus is one of the archangels.  You know, you're teaching that Jesus is the same person as Michael?  The archangel in the Old Testament?  And explain, but Michael was just one of the chief princes.  And then showed him Daniel 10, 13, where it says that Michael was one of the chief princes.  And he goes, well, I never noticed that.  I go, well, now that you notice, I mean... what does that do?  I go here again.  My point is not, here, let me show you this, or let me question this one detail about your theology.  My point is, is you'd never open this book, read it from cover to cover 20 times, and go, you know what?  Jesus is Michael the archangel.  You'd never get that.  Seriously, it's not like something that's going to... That's not what you're going to get, just like you're not going to get, you know, the whole succession of gods and on and on and on.  That's not what you would come to.  What would you come to?  through exegesis, through reading this book and just going, okay, what's the truth?  See, and I told him, look, you guys grew up, I go, I feel bad for you.  You grew up in a system.  You were told this way, and I can't imagine how hard it would be for you tonight to get by yourself, not even the two of you together, just alone with God.  I don't think you really believe this when you're alone.  And I said that, I go, I can't imagine you really do before the Holy Spirit, before the scriptures, just you alone.  Could you please just consider getting alone And reading this book and studying this book and being open to the Holy Spirit saying, whatever it says, I'm going to do and I'm going to obey.  We just try that rather than the system you were brought into.  That's a really difficult thing to do when you're brought up a certain way.  Now, we'll listen to those examples and you'll go right on, right on, right on.  Okay.  But now I want to challenge your upbringing.  Even in the evangelical church, right?  even what we're doing right now, because this is what I've been struggling with for the last couple of years.  If I started with Scripture, let's be fair.  Let's be fair to everyone.  Let's be fair to the Jehovah's Witnesses.  Let's be fair to the Mormons.  And let's look at ourselves and go, if you started with this book, is this the type of gathering you would have come up with? ",
