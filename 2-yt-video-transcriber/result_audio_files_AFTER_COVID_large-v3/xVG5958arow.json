            "text": "Listen, I think a lot of this stems from, like when you see those Hebrew Israelites in New York, the dudes that be standing like this, read, it says that in this one that the black man, stop right there.  You see, the white man is the devil, and they have the little superhero shit on, and then there's always a little Jewish man going, you're wrong, you're wrong.  No, that's not true.  Listen to the white man, we ain't got time for the bullshit.  And then if you walk past and you're black, say, brother, you need to listen to this scripture, man.  Don't let these white people be like, no, I'm just going to an audition.  Fuck that audition.  Read.  It says right here that the black man needs to stop.  We are the chosen people.  We are the 12 tribes of Judah.  Now listen.  This is coming from, I think, this is coming from being lied to for so long, right?  Being lied to.  Making all the images white, even though you just said they're melanated people.  These people were melanated.  In the Bible, when I was reading it, I went to Catholic school for 12 years.  Everybody was white, man.  The King James Version of this, they don't talk about... The black royalty, the black kings and queens that were in Europe, they don't bring that up.  They don't bring back how a lot of these people were black.  They don't bring up none of that shit.  Everybody was white.  When I watched the Ten Commandments, right, Charlton Heston's a white dude that goes up into the mountains and shit, and he said he talked to God.  Cleopatra's white.  Everybody's white.  That's where that's coming from.  It's that the images that they changed.  Why is it that they did a movie recently on Egypt and everybody was white?  Gerard Butler, and I know Gerard.  Gerard's from Scotland.  And why is he in an Egyptian movie?  I'm not saying that Europeans couldn't be in Egypt, but why are the main characters all white?  Why is the Great Wall with Matt Damon, Genghis Khan, why is he not Mongolian?  Why is he white?  What is this with this fucking... This addiction or this thing about making all these people that aren't white, white?  Why are you telling stories with white people in them that are not white?  What the fuck is that?  And that is where I think... This comes from the Hebrew Israelites.  It's the lies, and the way they come at it, you're so pissed off that you go, that's right, the white devils.  We're not saying that there's every white person walking around just trying to fuck everything up.  We're talking about these historians that have literally, purposely changed the history, left us out of it, and all we're stuck to is slavery and the NBA.  There's a problem there. ",
