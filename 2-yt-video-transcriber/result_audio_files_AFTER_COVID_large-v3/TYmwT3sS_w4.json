            "text": "If they had any children and any decency, they would walk away from here with their heads down.  Now as the Dublin West representative, Roger Gargarman's in way earlier, I felt obligated to have something done.  Just send a nice little message to Roger Gargarman, his supporters, and people who support this train of thought in general.  We got leaflets done up.  called for Roderick O'Gorman to resign.  On the back foot we have three reasons why we want Roderick O'Gorman to resign.  His associations to Peter Tatchell is he wants to push children under 16 being able to change the agenda.  Absolute madness.  how any child under the age of 16 can make a decision of that nature is beyond me.  how these people even have belief that children under the age of 16 can make this decision.  The third reason then why we're calling for the resignation of Roderick O'Gorman is the RSE sex education that he's pushing into the schools.  In this sex education, he's talking, it's not even that he's talking, it's the legislation itself that's being pushed from somewhere else and it's being handed to the Irish government and it's being handed to governments all across Europe.  This is the ideology that we want you to implement into your skills.  It's policy, you just have to do it.  And Ellie Barnes, the keynote speaker of the INTO conference, she's quoted as saying, like, this is coming.  Like, this is in policy.  We have to implement it.  We don't get a choice.  And she's also then quoted saying that don't send the letter home to parents.  Don't ask them for their consent.  The last thing you want is 30 people showing up and screaming abuse at you.  Like, sure, who wants that?  I want that because I want to know if my daughter is being educated on these things because I don't agree with it.  And I'm sure as hell certain there's other parents that don't agree with it either.  And all we're asking for is information.  Send to people, be honest, frank with them, give them the information and let them make the decision on what way their kids are educated themselves. ",
