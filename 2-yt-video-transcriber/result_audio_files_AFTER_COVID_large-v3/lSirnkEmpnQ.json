So much has been going on.  I am working on stuff, I promise.  I'm currently between flats so I'm moving all of my stuff to this new place.  This isn't really an important update or anything, it's just me saying thank you so much for supporting me and my dog.  As you can see, this is my current work situation, so I really need to get this together before I, you know, finish the video that I'm working on.  I will definitely see you soon, and Black Lives Matter! ",
