            "text": "People talk a lot about Midwestern values.  Here in Michigan, we live those values.  Things like decency, honesty, and respect.  Treating everyone the same.  But we're hurting in Michigan right now.  In our factories, on our farms, in our hearts.  We're living basically pay to check to paycheck and then some months let the credit card bill go.  Michigan's the worst right now.  We believe when we look someone in the eye and tell them what we're going to do, we do it.  We don't say one thing and do another.  Here in Michigan, we believe in the golden rule.  We believe in paying our fair share.  In Michigan, we don't pound our chests and blow our own horns.  We just get the job done.  We suit up, show up, and get to work.  We take responsibility.  Here in Michigan, we don't believe in paying off porn stars to keep their mouths shut about who we really are.  And we don't think much of a man who disrespects women.  In fact, we don't think he's much of a man at all.  Michigan deserves a president who tells the truth.  Michigan needs change.  Michigan deserves a president who cares about all of us.  Michigan deserves a president who believes in things like decency, honesty, and respect.  I'm Jeff Daniels.  I grew up in Michigan, lived here most of my life.  Still do.  I voted for Joe Biden. ",
