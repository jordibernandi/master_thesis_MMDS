            "text": "hey everyone and welcome back to another video in which we are going to be asking once again am i the bad guy?  you may recognize these posts from this subreddit which name i'm not going to say for the sake of monetization and all that good stuff and that's because i'm not a huge swearer.  so we're just going to say bad guy.  because Yeah, reasons.  This is just a relaxed little series of unscripted videos in which we take a look at some of these posts and kind of discuss the issues around them in which people are having kind of moral dilemmas, saying, am I the bad guy if I do this?  Was I the bad guy if I did this?  Should I do this?  Shouldn't I do this?  And we're just gonna be taking a look at them, discussing the situations, and having a little talk about them before opening the conversation up to you guys so you can share your thoughts down in the comments below.  This is a short series of videos and I'm filming quite a lot of them today, so if you want to check out the full series of these videos, the playlist for it will be linked down in the description below.  Please go check out the others, because... I get quite emotional and ranty in them.  And if you like that kind of thing, you'll love those videos.  Today's post that we're gonna be looking at is titled, am I the bad guy for not paying my daughter, 19, her college tuition and rent anymore since she refuses to help out with the new baby?  Interesting.  Hi Reddit, my husband and I have always tried to provide the best we can for our two daughters, 19 and 14.  We're both well-paid engineers and have set aside money to pay for our daughter's college tuition and weddings.  College tuition understand weddings?  It's an odd one to me, anyway.  My elder daughter is in college and also lives with us completely rent free.  That's a nice thing for you to do for her.  Nice if you can do it, I guess.  We're now having another kid and we wanted our elder daughter to help out with some childcare things during the day, like changing diapers and also watching the baby some evenings and weekends when needed.  My older daughter said it was not her responsibility and that she absolutely wouldn't help out with the baby.  During this conversation, a lot of words were exchanged and she, perhaps in anger or in all seriousness, I don't know, said we better not expect her to help take care of us when we're older either.  My husband and I have always tried to help our daughters out as much as we can, and we thought they would do the same for us.  But my older daughter has some very strict boundaries on what her obligations are as a child and says she owes us nothing.  Which is true, but my husband and I had serious talks about everything that happened and decided perhaps it's in our best interest to take older daughter's tuition slash wedding money and save it for the new baby.  and in our retirement savings account instead, given that we would not be receiving any help from anyone else.  Our older daughter freaked out and called us all kinds of names.  We still let her live with us rent free, but it's becoming really unbearable living with her and all the animosity she's showing me and my husband right now.  We said we would continue to pay for the rest of her sophomore year, but she would have to start working or taking out loans to pay the rest, We're not doing this to spite her, but rather to look out for our own best interests.  So Reddit, am I the bad guy here?  Oh, tough one.  No, yes, yes you are.  That's awful.  All because she won't provide free childcare.  I'm sorry, but if you have a child, you should be responsible for it.  You should be prepared to look after it.  If you can't look after the kid, don't have a child.  Don't have a child if you're expecting someone else to take care of that child.  however much percent of the time it's your responsibility.  it's your child.  it's no one else's.  yes it can be great when older siblings help out with younger ones but only if they offer.  it's not their responsibility it's yours as a parent.  i was very very lucky that my uh sister she's 14 years older than me and she was basically like a second mom to me when i was a kid and even now like she's one of my favorite people in the world and we're very very close and i love her to bits.  but She looked after me so much because she wanted to, not because my parents made her, and not because they forced her to do it by saying, oh, we'll take away this, this, and this if you don't.  That's awful.  And as a parent, it's your responsibility to set your kid up for the best possible life they can have, right?  Why would you want to say, oh, you know, older daughter, take time out of your education so you can be a nanny for us.  That's not helping your kid at all, is it?  You're putting your new baby ahead of your older daughter and that's not fair.  All your kids should get an equal opportunity.  And if you've offered to help her out with things like tuition fees, It's not fair to take that away when she's done nothing wrong.  She's clearly trying to focus on her education and her career, and she's been responsible.  Don't punish her for that.  The stuff about her saying she won't take care of them in their old age, like, I do find that a little more complicated, because on the one hand... maybe she should offer to do that kind of stuff out of kindness.  But again, it's not an obligation.  She's right that she didn't ask to be born and she didn't ask for any of this stuff.  So she doesn't have an obligation to do anything.  And yeah, if they are trying to essentially inadvertently ruin her education and her career, and they're asking for these things that she can't and shouldn't have to give, then yeah, I don't really see why she has any obligation to them anymore.  I don't know, that bit's complicated.  I'm not quite sure how to express myself properly about that.  That's tough.  All that said, having stuff like having your parents pay for college tuition and stuff should never be taken for granted.  That's... something she's incredibly lucky to have and it's wonderful that she does have it living rent free as well incredibly lucky she should be grateful.  don't take that for granted but i don't think she is and it's not like she's demanding that stuff and it's not like she's saying i'm entitled to this but the money's clearly there, the offer for it was there, and I don't think it's fair for the parents to take it away at this stage.  I don't know.  I'm also very intrigued by what this person, kind of like, what they expect of their soon-to-be middle daughter, the 14-year-old.  Do they also expect her to start looking after the baby and, you know, for her schoolwork to take a hit so she can look after her sibling?  Do they expect her to, you know, leave school some afternoons so she can come home and change nappies and stuff as well?  Are they going to threaten to kick her out if she doesn't do it?  It seems like they're just trying to take advantage of their older daughter and then getting mad when she says, no, I won't let you do that.  And I don't think that's fair.  But I don't know.  Maybe I just have a kind of like weird biased view here because I wouldn't personally want to look after any kids myself, whether they were siblings or not.  Although at this point, that's impossible.  but I don't know.  maybe maybe you can let me know like if you think differently if you're a parent or if you're someone who is an older sibling who's looked after your younger ones.  maybe you can tell me if you've had a different experience to this.  I don't know.  maybe you can see where the parents are coming from but for me I think yes the mother here is being the bad guy and the daughter is not.  but they're just my thoughts.  what do you think of parents kind of I guess controlling their children's lives and threatening to take away things like financial support if they don't do exactly what the parents want.  What is your opinion on things like that?  Do you think it should be allowed?  Do you think basic parenting stuff should come with conditions like this?  Or do you think it's wrong of parents like this to essentially use career and education as a bargaining chip to get what they want out of their kids?  I don't know.  Let me know your thoughts for that down in the comments below.  This one thankfully hasn't been quite as much of a ranty video as the last two, I don't think.  As always, I would love to hear your thoughts down in the comments below.  Please start a conversation, get chatting with each other, share your experiences and stories and your thoughts on all this.  I love, love, love reading your comments and I'll see you guys again very soon.  Thank you for watching today and I appreciate you guys so much. ",
