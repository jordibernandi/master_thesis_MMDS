            "text": "Oh, Austin, the progressive oasis of the great state of Texas.  Say, defunding the fuzz looks like just the ticket here.  Now, I recently set up shop there for the latest installment of Change My Mind.  If you missed that segment, you can click the card or the link in the description down below to check it out.  But even after we found a sidewalk that wasn't entirely soaked with bum piss, not too many people were eager to sit down.  What?  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Why don't you come talk about it?  I think you're a bitch.  I think you're a bitch in your car, Mr.  Sonata.  What up, you?  On the other hand, some felt a little too comfortable approaching some of our fans.  What's going on?  I'm not doing nothing.  I'm not doing nothing.  No, no.  They're breaking the law.  Man, they're breaking the fuck out of here.  Who's breaking the law?  I'm breaking the law.  Back up, back up, back up.  Don't get physical.  Back up, back up, man.  You're a gold digger.  All you want is some money.  You don't want no relationship.  Do you know him?  No.  Exactly.  You don't know me.  All right, let's just back up.  If I was John Cena, I bet you you're a fucking... If I was Dwayne the Rock, Justin, you'll fuck me.  Nobody wants to fuck you here, man.  You might just want to get out of here.  Man, leave me the fuck alone, man.  Don't touch me, bro.  Get out of here.  Leave me alone, bro.  Get out of here and leave the woman alone.  That's enough.  Leave me alone, bro.  That's enough.  Leave me alone.  You touch me, I'm going to curse you, bro.  You're going to curse me?  Man, I know witchcraft, bro.  Okay, that's fine.  Don't touch me, bro.  Well, I'm not going to touch you, but... I know witchcraft, fool.  I understand.  I'm going to curse you and your firstborn son if you touch me.  Okay, all right.  Well, I don't want that to happen to my firstborn son, but, you know, if you have to do what you have to do.  Just leave the woman alone and go on your merry way.  No, I can do whatever the fuck I want.  No, you can't.  This is America.  Actually, you can't.  That's assault.  I didn't touch the lady.  Okay, good.  So let's keep it that way.  But she's uncomfortable.  You're being pretty violent.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I'm out here doing the work of Jesus Christ trying to defend these goddamn men out here for these sorry-ass females out here.  Jesus Christ called a lot of women gold-digging suckers, did he?  I didn't read about that in Mark.  Come on, you want to read the Bible?  I got the Bible with me.  Go ahead and read your Bible and do your witchcraft.  Thanks, man.  Is everyone good?  Yeah, we're good.  You okay?  By the way, just while we're talking about, you know, I saw the big Wonder Woman sign, don't forget the ladies, which seem to have been forgotten right now with the looting and Black Lives Matter and this stuff going on.  This is a perfect example of what you just saw of an anti-rape culture.  I saw every man around step in, make sure that the women were safe.  He was following them.  He was chasing them.  And I didn't see a bunch of guys going, oh, yeah, secretly, we're on board with the rape.  I saw every guy get protective and want to keep the women safe.  I appreciate you guys doing that.  Thank you.  And it's not virtue signaling.  It's not white knighting.  It's just making sure that women don't get hit, women don't get hurt, women don't get raped.  I think we're all on board with that.  That's what men instinctively want to do.  So good to see the city's priorities come to fruition.  Keep Austin weird.  Whoa.  And remember, if you want these conversations to continue, please consider joining up at lottoworthcrowder.com slash mugclub, where you get a wonderful hand-etched mug, an exclusive full-length daily show, and it helps us to go out and make the kind of content that you see here.  But on with the show.  Word got to Antifa that I was in town, and they decided to make an appearance.  Hi.  You'd like to come over and talk?  No?  The reason I'm not going to is because this narrative is dangerous, and this narrative got Garrett Foster murdered.  Really?  We ought to say that these people out here saying Black Lives Matter are domestic terrorists.  You're putting lives at risk, so I will not talk to you.  You know what you're doing.  Garrett Foster was killed because he aimed an AK-47 point-blank in a car.  He said he didn't.  No, no.  The guy was right.  No, but the police report.  Let's change the sign.  Let's change the sign.  We're going to change the sign just for you.  We're going to change the sign just for you about Garrett Foster, brother.  Let's change the sign.  If you'd like to see the conversation on Garrett Foster that could have happened, click the link in this video.  But now, back to Boombox Boy for some more peace.  You can't even tell me your face, man.  So now, I'm waiting to tell you.  I'm going to tell you.  I'm going to tell you.  Fuck Donald Trump.  Yeah, fuck Donald Trump.  Yeah, fuck Donald Trump.  Yeah, fuck Donald Trump.  Yeah, fuck Donald Trump.  Yeah, fuck Donald Trump.  Yeah, fuck Donald Trump.  Yeah, fuck Donald Trump.  Oh no!  Mommy's checks didn't clear for those clutch lessons!  Now, we were sitting down for a nice conversation with our new friend Molly, who, unbeknownst to Antifa, just happens to be biracial.  But these guys seem to think that it's dangerous to have conversations, and they continue to try and shut it down.  You said two years ago you left.  You were more liberal.  Yeah.  What changed?  So, I actually remember the epiphany I had.  I was sitting on the couch.  Hold on.  I don't want that product placement.  Oh, yeah.  So, two years ago, after numerous conversations with my husband, who's on the opposite side.  One second.  Stop silencing black voices!  Stop silencing black voices!  Stop silencing black voices!  Stop silencing black voices!  Stop silencing black voices!  Stop silencing black voices!  Stop silencing black voices!  Stop silencing black voices!  Stop silencing black voices!  It worked!  Sorry, I know there was a little tokenism there, but I hope you understand.  I can't believe that worked.  No, wait, I totally can.  It's a common ailment in which the identity-politic-obsessed brain experiences a neurotransmission short circuit, and it is no non-laughing matter.  On with Molly.  Okay, so you left.  Yeah.  What was the epiphany?  So, two years ago, sitting on the couch with my husband, and we had multiple conversations.  We've been together eight years.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, so we've been married for four.  Anyway, two years ago, after multiple conversations, I was sitting on my section on the couch, and my husband said something to me.  And he said, this isn't about altering the Constitution.  It's about long term.  If you start somewhere, where is it going to end?  So that's what kicked it off.  Then I started thinking, all right, that's true.  What other logical facts and things can I put together?  So then I started researching.  So I realized the news never talks about that or numbers.  Right.  So then I started looking at my own incredible sites like the FBI, CDC, the U.S.  Census.  And that's when I started uncovering that the narrative doesn't make sense.  It doesn't make sense at all.  And do you want me to touch on Black Lives Matter?  Sure, you can touch on it.  But let me ask you this.  My question is this.  These people who claim that they're obviously in line with Black Lives Matter, and that guy just said that they've been there to have it in his back.  Boy, I hate... This is my real concern, and you tell me if you've seen this.  Black Lives Matter, we have their charter here, and Antifa, since they're one and the same.  My concern is that it'll breed more racism, because you see this asshole's behavior?  Most black people are not on board with this, but they unfortunately have a megaphone to speak for them, and I will tell you, I do see younger people... having this rebound effect and that's what i was curious i want to talk with you about because you're here you're obviously your black biracial voice.  um and they show up to silence us because they said we were putting black lives at risk.  that really scares me.  I wonder what that's like living as a black person right now who doesn't agree and they speak for you.  It's really upsetting because you look at me and say, well, she's not black, she's black, so then she must be on board with this stuff.  Right.  And that's not true.  And the reason why I'm not on board with things like Black Lives Matter is because it's like, why are we focusing on like, I don't know if this is exactly 0.6%, but why are we focusing on the few... unjustified killing over the span of X amount of years.  We agree.  Unjustified.  Why are we focusing on that?  I'm just going to say .6%.  Why are we focusing on that when the number one court goes to the CDC?  I know you know all this.  Thomas died.  Yeah, we just talked to that guy.  He said he didn't care so much.  It's like, why are we focusing on that and not talking about the real issues within our community?  Why are we not taking accountability and trying to... It's the number one killer.  In fact, actually, when I was on the CDC, I was like, okay, what's the top killer for black people?  It's just not even like the young age range.  So I know it's number one for like 15 to 34, homicide, right?  It's like 15 to 44, but yeah.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah.  So I thought it was actually number six.  Which seems weird to me.  It's actually 14.  I think we have them right here.  This is the... Yeah, we have the Department of Justice, like 14 to 44, like which 14-year-olds are committing murders?  Are they black Chucky dolls?  I don't know.  And then it's in the top 10, right?  Yeah, it's number one killer for young people.  Yeah, but I think it's like number six, like overall top 10.  Right.  Okay, so then we go, I was like, okay, well surely if I go to like the white Hispanic ethnicities, it's going to be in the top 10 homicide.  It's not, not even in the top 10.  No.  even if you go into poor areas.  So then it's also like, why?  Why, why, why?  We're not violent by nature.  We're not bad people.  Black people are not bad.  And it goes down to socioeconomic danger, welfare, and the family unit.  That's what's so disturbing.  We were talking about this with the Black Lives Matter chart.  A lot of people don't know.  This you can go find on their website.  You know, disrupt the Western prescribed nuclear family structure.  Nope, not with that.  I know, I was on the website.  So when you abolish the police, by the way, I find it hilarious, they also want to abolish prisons.  Like, Derek Chauvin, in prison, right back out.  Like, how do you keep police officers accountable?  But destroying the Western prescribed nuclear family, that will do irreparable harm to not only America at large, but specifically black communities.  That's something that we need to, I mean, I noticed a wedding ring.  Now, have you been married for eight years?  We've been married before.  Oh, congratulations.  Thank you.  Year five is when it kind of settles in.  I've been married for eight years now.  Oh, sh... I have an anniversary coming up.  I just realized I forgot about it.  I just realized.  Yeah, it is.  I think this is what I was trying to talk about.  And we just sat down and spoke with that black man.  Unfortunately, I think we made some headway.  And he asked me why I wouldn't saddle up and protest with him.  But then he wouldn't just ask him to stop drowning out.  It's like, well, you want me to go and protest with you and Luke?  And basically riot, as we've seen in Austin, but you won't have this guy.  just stop silencing our speech.  So it is really concerning to me that we're not looking at all black lives.  And these people speak for the guy who's trying to dress up like kick-ass over here.  You know that's where he's inspired, right?  You saw a kick-ass movie poster.  He's like, that is going to look awesome.  I'm going to ally the shit out of this vest.  Yeah.  But yeah, you're right.  And I think because I was on the opposite side a couple of years ago where I didn't want to really think about it and the logical steps and ask why, it's really hard.  I understand the hard thinking, but part of it's pride.  You don't want to admit that you're wrong.  You've been instilled all your life when you're a minority.  Especially in the black community, you're a victim.  You're the victim.  You're a victim.  The government owes you something.  The government owes you something.  I'm not a victim.  Yeah, doesn't seem like it.  I think the victims are these guys out here who are wearing these get-ups and they'll never get to hear a point of view like yours.  No, and it's very uncomfortable because then, you know, when you're not white and you are for the things that we're talking about, like fixing the family unit, taking accountability within community, focusing on the right things that make black lives matter.  They're seeing us, kind of the cops, the police, the traitors, and it's like, why does my skin color and my race have to determine what party I'm affiliated with?  Yeah, I understand.  Yeah, and it's unfortunate that this is the kind of behavior that's been taking place in these protests, and it's branded Black Lives Matter.  It's really uncomfortable when people assume, just because you look a certain way, like, how about not racist?  Yeah.  Well, it's also really racist to look at those statistics and assume that it's just because of color of skin and not understand that it's because of family units.  It's because of the breakdown.  They're not asking the right questions.  Why?  Why?  Why?  I think if my community were to keep asking why are we like this, what has happened in our past, like an honest conversation, we would start to uncover.  I think it, in my opinion, it goes down to the family unit thing.  That's where it starts in our community.  But statistically, it's undeniable.  And you know what?  Here's something that I think that you and I, we talk about privilege, take for granted.  But first off, the biggest privilege I've ever had is I have a mother and a father who love me.  But we do both enjoy a privilege in that I just spoke with a man who's a Black Lives Matter activist who believes in abolishing the police.  There's a guy that was in here, right?  Yeah.  I got to speak with him and hear his point of view, and he heard mine.  You'll get to speak with people like that.  These people, these Antifa protesters, will never have the privilege of hearing a different point of view.  They want to bitch about education.  They'll never have the privilege of actually educating themselves.  Why does it have to be all or nothing?  Why can't we be in the middle?  I know.  All right.  Well, thank you.  Your name?  My name's Molly.  Molly.  Are you shaking hands?  Yeah, I can shake your hand.  Thank you, Molly.  I appreciate you coming out.  Stay safe.  They might not be happy with you.  Thank you.  Thank you so much.  Yeah, let's move along.  that's fine.  let's let's go a long path around.  When the black girl leaves, he starts his motorcycle up.  It works like a charm.  Right on cue from Clutch Brick.  So what do you think?  How would you deal with these kinds of mob tactics, especially in a time when people are unfortunately increasingly resorting to violence?
