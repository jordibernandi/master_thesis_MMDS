            "text": "Hello, I'm Carlton Pearson.  Listen to this word.  It's provocative, but it's also powerfully instructive.  When you hang out with someone and share your energy with them, you're not just giving them energy, but receiving their energy in exchange as well.  The very basic law of energy is that it moves in circles.  every time you allow someone in your energy field.  You are creating an energetic connection with them.  If you're not aware, you start absorbing all the programs and beliefs of the other person without even realizing it.  Be extremely conscious of with whom you're establishing an energetic connection because people come with their own emotional baggage.  Spiritual maturity is being in control of the energetic connections you create with others and not hanging out with just everybody is a big part of it.  Honor your energy and be aware of the people you hang around.  That's a powerful lesson that we should all learn.  You don't have to reject.  Just decide who, when, and how you want to be with other human beings.  All of us carry vibrations and energy.  That's an important awareness.  Love you.  Believe in you.  Om Shanti. ",
