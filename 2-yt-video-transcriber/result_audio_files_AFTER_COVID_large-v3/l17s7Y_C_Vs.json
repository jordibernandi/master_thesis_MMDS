Women are leading the way, and they can't see what they're doing because they're into their mind, they're emotional.  It's the men that's needed.  That's why everything is falling apart.  I do want you to know that once you wake up, you're going to catch pure hell from your wife.  Because she's not going to lose that control over you.  And she's going to be like, oh, you don't love me.  You used to cater to me.  You used to hug me.  You used to do this, right?  But what she's saying is, you're not letting me control you anymore.  I don't know how to handle that.  You're going to change and you're going to catch hell from her because she's losing that control over you and her ego won't be able to handle it.  And she would be like, I'm going to leave.  I'm going back home to mama.  And then if that doesn't work, she'll bake you a cake.  And if that doesn't work, she'll give you some sex.  And you should take it all, but don't change.  Eat the cake, but don't change.  And when you have sex, just have a quick, quick, bam, bam, thank you, ma'am.  Did you know that sex shouldn't last more than two or three minutes?  Two or three seconds.  Did y'all know that?  But the women have men licking and lapping and It's going for hours now.  The women are like, worship me, worship me.  And the men are just worshiping.  When really the only purpose for sex is to make a baby.  You're supposed to... If you seek the kingdom of God in his right way, God will put a woman into your life if that's your heart desire.  You would date her without the sex because once you have sex with her, she takes control over you.  It's like a drug.  And you wake up to it.  You become emotional.  And you feel like you can't do without it.  She has control over you.  So you don't really see the woman that you're marrying.  And then once you marry her, The morning after the night of, you wonder what in the world happened, right?  But it's like a drug.  So you were high, and you didn't see what you were getting.  But if you don't have sex with the woman before marriage, you will see what you're getting into.  And if it's not the right woman for you, the right wife or the mother for your children, you'll be able to walk away from it without tripping.  Why did your father protect you from your mother?  Thank you. ",
