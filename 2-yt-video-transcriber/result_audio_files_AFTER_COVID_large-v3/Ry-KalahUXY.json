And I'm sure this isn't a surprise necessarily to you, but the number was, do you know how much more likely a black male, specifically a black male under the age of 30, is to commit homicide than a white male?  I do not.  It's over 35 times more likely.  50% of all homicides in the country are committed by black males.  Now, a lot of that is gang violence, as you know, that happens in neighborhoods.  And they don't have that so much even in poor white neighborhoods.  They don't really have the same gang on gang violence.

At least strip some of the power away from police unions that protect bad police officers.  And I think we need better training for police officers, specifically in unarmed combat.

No, this is a guy who likely wasn't just drunk, but he was so inebriated, he fell asleep in the drive-thru line, failed the sobriety test, and when they tried to simply handcuff him, beat the shit out of him.  beat the hell out of two officers, stole a gun.

We always have these sources so that people can reference them, but I tell you what I do.  This is just my advice.  I could be wrong.  Assume that there is no unbiased media.  So assume that you're getting some kind of a spin left or right.  And so start off with that.  What I do is I set bookmarks.  And if I read Fox News, right away I read HuffPo.  And then if I read something like Daily Caller, right away I read Slate.  And I just make sure that I stack my deck right, left, right, left, so that I can see the same story covered from different angles.  And then I'll go and look up the original sources and try and find the data that's actually accurate and unbiased.

I mean, there was a time in this country where black people had to kneel, unfortunately, and that was slavery.  that we ended, and I think is a great evil.  And as Christians, we're called to kneel before no man.  They're still in Africa, by the way.  The Pygmies have to, was it the Bantu tribes?  They have to kneel to other tribes.  Six million people are slaves in Africa, not to mention across Asia.  The whole reason that the American flag, we have this, we stand for the Pledge of Allegiance, is because it's a country that requires us to kneel for no man.  And so I think people have said, well, kneeling is so symbolic.  I agree.  And the moment you ask someone to kneel over their whiteness, it's just as evil as asking someone to kneel over their blackness.  And it tells me that it's not about equality.  And this is the kind of conversation.  This is what I think is productive.  And like you said, the only thing that's going to heal us is shared values.  And in the United States, those shared values that say you don't kneel to anybody, those are Christian fundamentalist values, as the media would call it.  I just think it's Americanism. ",
