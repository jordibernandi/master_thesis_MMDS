I'm driving your car, but I just got a notification that Ruth Bader Ginsburg died!  Okay.  Was that one of your fares, is it?  Because, you know, you're not supposed to ask for their name.  They're supposed to ask for... Did this year get any fucking worse?  I mean, yes.  We could get a death that's unexpected or untimely in some way.  Plus, while you're busy breathlessly screeching over the loss of the privilege of stacking the deck that you once had, instead of paying attention to the road and the way you're going, I also might fail to reach my destination.  You just had to make it to 2021!  Fifth and Main!  Fifth and Main!  You're not even listening to me.  Look, I may have to knock a star off of the review for this.  And please do watch out for the truck.  Hi.  Uh, listen, my last Uber driver was so, like, politically warped and hysterical that she caused a 15-vehicle pileup on a busy road.  So if it's not, like, too much to ask, I would prefer it if we could... ",

It's because you're too busy destroying everything else first.  You know, fascism, among other things, is typically characterized by a very small-minded one-track system that impulsively rejects any and all alternatives to it without a second thought.  Say, why do you have such a reactionary aversion to alternatives?  Because the alternative is a fucking fascist!  What's a fascist? ",

Is there any chance, and this is a guess, but an educated guess, is there any chance that by fascist you mean anyone who is not a communist?  Would that perhaps be a little reductive?  Maybe we can have the conversation about dismantling the two-party system when a fascist isn't running!  And then we can finally implement our one-party system where we abolish private property and seize the means of production on behalf of whoever now owns all of that property.  This is, of course, anti-fascism!  Because as we know, an anti-fascist is an anti-fascist.  Don't let those McCarthyian conspiracy theorist dinosaurs tell you otherwise.  Do remember this, folks, this video, and do play it on repeat in response to any of those thick-browed, dead-eyed children trapped in the minds of the manipulated undead who for their whole lives have been yelling fascist at every inconvenience they experience.  I've done it.  You've all done it.  Don't pretend you've never done it.  You learned that word when you were young and you thought it meant just authoritarian.  And you still do think it means that whenever it suits you.  The police arrest someone, it's fascism.  They confiscated your anthrax, it's fascism.  You're not allowed in this nightclub wearing coloured sneakers, it's fascism.  The teacher gave you a detention for stabbing another kid in the eye, it's fascism.  It's completely irrelevant what fascism actually means or ever meant.  It's just a word we use to describe every rule we don't like.  And we keep doing it.  No fascist ever challenges it and comes to the defense of actual fascism because there aren't any actual fascists.  But the moment, the very first moment you hear someone calling anyone. ",
