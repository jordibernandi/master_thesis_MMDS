            "text": "How's everybody doing?  My name is Anthony Brian Logan.  And today we got to talk about an NBA basketball player by the name of Jonathan Isaac, who plays forward center for the Orlando Magic, who refused to engage in the anthem kneeling and the Black Lives Matter shirt wearing.  OK, well, all his teammates and everybody else in the whole league, I guess probably collective bargained to kneel during the anthem and wear the Black Lives Matter shirt.  He says, you know what?  I'm not going to do that.  I'm going to stand up like a man, not wear a BLM shirt and bow my head in prayer.  And prayer is the key thing here because Jonathan Isaac is a Christian.  He has preached before at a church in Orlando, Florida, where he plays basketball.  Now, before I get into this anymore, let's watch this clip.  In this clip, you'll see NBA reporter Taylor Rooks.  Why didn't he kneel?  Why didn't he wear the BLM shirt?  If he thinks that Black Lives Matter, you'll see his response.  After we get done watching that, I'll talk about what he said.  Then I give you my two cents, my deep detail analysis.  And then I wrap it on up with a nice bow on top.  So without further ado, let's go ahead and roll it. ",

            "text": "Absolutely.  I believe that Black Lives Matter.  A lot went into my decision.  And part of it is, first off, is my thought that, you know, kneeling or wearing a Black Lives Matter T-shirt don't go hand in hand with supporting Black Lives.  And so I felt like just me personally and what it is that I believe in standing on a standstill.  I do believe that Black Lives Matter, but I just felt like it was a decision that I had to make.  And I didn't feel like putting that shirt on and kneeling one hand in hand with supporting Black Lives or that it made me support Black Lives or not.  I believe that for myself, my life has been supported through the gospel of Jesus Christ.  and that everyone is made in the image of God and that we all fall short of God's glory.  And that each and every one of us, each and every day, do things that we shouldn't do.  We say things that we shouldn't say.  We hate and we dislike people that we shouldn't hate and dislike.  And sometimes it gets into a point where we point fingers about whose evil is worse.  And sometimes that comes down to simply whose evil is most visible.  So I felt like I wanted to just take a stand on it.  I feel like we all make mistakes, but I think that the gospel of Jesus Christ is that there's grace for us and that Jesus came and died for our sins.  And that if we all will come to an understanding of that and understand that God wants to have a relationship with us, that we can get past skin color, we can get past jacked up.  I think when you look around, racism isn't the only thing that plagues our society, that plagues our nation, that plagues our world.  And I feel like, you know, coming together on that message that we want to get past not only racism, but everything that plagues this other society, I feel like the answer to it is the gospel. ",

Can you just explain further what you feel like religion has to do with kneeling for the anthem to protest against racism and police brutality, the correlation between those two? ",

            "text": "Well, I mean, honestly, I don't really see it as religion for myself.  I see it as a relationship with God through his son who died for our sins.  I feel like not only, I don't think that kneeling or putting on a t-shirt for me personally is the answer.  I feel like for me, black lives are supported through the gospel.  All lives are supported through the gospel that we all, like I said, have things that we do our own.  Sometimes it gets into a place of pointing fingers about which wrong is worse.  And who's wrong is seen.  So I feel like the Bible tells us that we all fall short of God's glory.  And that at the end of the day, whoever will humble themselves and seek God and repent of their sins, that we could see it in a different light.  See our mistakes, see people's mistakes in a different light.  See people's evil in a different light.  that would help bring us closer together and get past skin color and get past anything that, you know, that's on the surface and doesn't really deal with the hearts of men and women.

I'm Jesus, and that's why I stake my flag, and that's just how I felt.  And they respected me for it because they know who I am, they know my heart.  They know who I am as a teammate and a person. ",

            "text": "All right, you saw that.  You heard that.  Now, shout out to Jonathan Isaac.  You are a brave man, sir.  I know it can be tough.  You're in the NBA.  Everybody's kneeling.  Everybody has on the Black Lives Matter shirt.  This was something that was planned.  It was scripted.  It wasn't like, okay, all right, guys, what are we going to do before the game?  Everybody going to kneel?  Nah, you got all the shirts.  They're printing it up.  Said the same thing on it.  This was a thing that was orchestrated to send a message about police brutality.  Hands up.  Don't shoot this day.  and the third.  They also have Black Lives Matter.  like literally written on the basketball court.  so this was a thing that was talked about extensively before they did the quote-unquote bubble restart in florida to get games back going.  he says you know what i'm not gonna do that.  nope i'm gonna stand up like a man by my head in prayer and i'm not wearing a blm shirt.  and his answers that he gave were right on point.  it's like look I'm a man of God.  I'm a man of faith.  I think if we get back to God and get back to being in our faith, then all these things we have going on in the world, all the wickedness and whatnot, that will go away.  Now, you guys know I'm not a Christian, but it's OK, because I respect Christianity and I was raised in that kind of environment.  And if I were to be religious, I'd be that because that's what I most enjoy.  connect with as far as a value system.  You know, my value system, although I don't claim to be religious, is based on Christianity.  You see what I'm saying?  So I respect what he did 100%.  I would much rather have Jonathan Isaac out there talking about being Christian, talking about God, talking about Jesus, then what's going on with the BLM stuff?  There's no comparison.  You know, I will take that any day of the week.  I'll be totally happy 100%.  I'll be happy as a pig in a pile of mud.  You understand what I'm saying?  This whole BLM stuff, I'm not really a fan of because all it does is it just creates division.  We can unite under, you know, Christianity, Christian values.  That's what most of us are anyway.  Even if we don't necessarily claim to be religious, a lot of us have that kind of value system in us.  especially as Americans.  Now, the reporter, that was Taylor Rook's black woman.  She is most certainly in favor of BLM.  You go to her Instagram page, it's BLM-ness.  You know, how do we navigate as a black woman, this, that, and the third?  So, you know, she's like on that train.  I think she was even dating that guy, Jesse Williams.  You know, one of these, you know, barbershop revolutionaries who was kind of popular a few years ago.  I think she might have been dating him.  So she's like right on this whole Colin Kaepernick wave.  And speaking of Kaepernick, he's the one to blame for all of this, okay?  Because before him, it wasn't even a thing to kneel in the NBA.  Matter of fact, I think they had to do the collective bargaining agreement before the restart in this season because there was a rule in the books that said you couldn't kneel anyway because of what happened with Mahmoud Adouraouf, aka Chris Jackson, back in the 90s, all right?  Because everybody was standing during the anthem, handing over a heart.  But Chris Jackson became Mahmoud Abdul-Raouf during the season, during when he was in the NBA.  And he would start to pray, do a Muslim prayer during the anthem.  People didn't like that too much.  It was seen as a form of protest.  And he had to get out of the NBA.  He was blackballed.  And ever since then, there was a rule in the books that you couldn't actually do that in the NBA.  So this is why when the NFL guys were kneeling, it didn't happen in the NBA up until right now.  They probably changed that rule to be able to do so.  And Jonathan Isaac is not a fan of it.  So shout out to him.  He's a brave man.  And I feel like there's a lot of us out there that feel the same way he does.  but they don't want to come out and say anything because they don't want to offend anybody.  They don't want to get on the bad side of their peers.  And of course, if you're playing basketball, you want to be able to have team unity, camaraderie.  You don't want to be that one guy that's kind of like the outsider and not... going along with everybody else is doing.  but he was able to do that and i think that if more of us did that in general not just obviously playing nba basketball or nfl football if more of us did that in general in our everyday walking life then things would be a lot better.  shout out to the nhl for not doing any kind of anthem.  kneeling.  you know everybody stands up Hand over the heart.  You know, the funny part about it is you get a lot of these guys over here in the States, a lot of hockey fans that are kneeling.  Quote unquote, I say fans very loosely.  You got these guys, you know, on Twitter and Facebook and the Instagrams kneeling with a Black Lives Matter sign.  Most of these guys, 99.99% are white.  So it's like, I don't even understand.  What are we even doing?  Is Black Lives Matter, like what is it at this point?  I don't really know.  I can't really tell what it is.  And I think that Jonathan Isaac was able to kind of see what I'm seeing.  Black Lives Matter, is it an organization we're supporting?  Is it a company we're supporting?  Is it a saying?  Is it something that is trying to be divisive?  Is it a thing that people use as a shield to do whatever they want to do?  Is it an avenue through which you're able to shed your guilt and feel like you're doing something positive in the world?  If you hear me right now and you support Black Lives Matter, just take a moment to zoom out and think, what am I really doing, all right?  How many black folks are gonna be helped by this thing?  We know that people have an issue with police brutality.  Whether it's an actual issue or not is a different story, so I digress.  My whole point is that we know that people have an issue with it.  They think it's a problem.  Okay, so wait, what's next?  The awareness has been raised.  What are you going to do now after that fact has been revealed to us?  You know, this is just no more than division.  It doesn't help us go forward as a nation.  And if we want positive change, if we want to go forward as a people and as a nation and you want to continue to prosper, then we need to get past all the division, all the hatefulness and do what Jonathan Isaac was saying.  Listen to that, man.  Young man, too.  Only third year in the league.  He's like 22, 23 years old.  Young man, really knowledgeable.  Listen to that guy rather than these guys on the ground, nearly trying to get attention, trying to just virtually signal for their audience.  But I think I'll leave that.  right there for now.  and what say you?  do you think that Jonathan Isaac was right on point what he was saying?  if that's your viewpoint let me know why in the comments below or was he not on point?  if that's your viewpoint let me know why in the comments below.  how do you feel about the reporter Taylor Brooks asking those questions?  and I'm reading a lot of articles online by the way and people are saying I don't know about this.  his You know, his reasoning was garbage.  A lot of white liberal writers talking about, I don't know, man, he didn't wear the BLM shirt.  It's like, how have we gotten to the point where it's okay for random white liberal guys to criticize black men about how to be black?  I don't understand how this makes any sense at all.  All I see from this whole BLM nonsense is division.  hatefulness and just a lack of cohesion in society.  We gotta get back to being as one as a people.  We can be different and have our differences, but all of the harping on the differences and creating more division does not help us at all.  We gotta get back to some semblance of unity rather than the constant intentional division.  But whatever your thoughts are, please let me know in the comments below.  And that's all I got to say for this video.  If you like what you heard, please comment, rate, share, and subscribe.  Peace. ",
