I talked to the district attorney's office and I got a detect, well, I talked to Kayla at the front desk.

This is in their back shed behind their attorney building right now when the district attorney is claiming that they have it in their possession as evidence.  And now this is the attorney family that I was investigating when they arrested me for trespassing and then confiscated my phone, which, you know, that kind of don't make sense for trespassing.  So, it's bizarre that it later winds up in the back shed of the attorney family who I was investigating for massive corruption and collusion with the district attorney.  This is what we're here.
