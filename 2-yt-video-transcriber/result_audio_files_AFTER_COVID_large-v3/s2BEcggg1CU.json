            "text": "My name is Will, and not voting for Biden turned me white.  Oh, yo, what's up, my fellow business associate?  This was me before the election.  Every celebrity, every politician, even my own family warned me that if I was black, I'd vote Biden.  But I didn't listen.  Then November 3rd, I woke up like this.  I'm looking at Kim Kardashian right now.  It does nothing for me.  I'm a black man trapped in a white man's body.  I'm a male Rachel Dolezal.  I'm a male Rachel Dolezal.  Finger on the trigger.  Two shots on a pinger.  Tinger?  Ginger?  Maybe, I don't know, shoot a ginger maybe?  People seem to love when you identify as all sorts of things, but now that I'm an actual black man trapped in the body of this dweeb, no one wants to acknowledge it.  I used to be like you.  Tried to get a haircut today at my favorite barber shop.  He told me he doesn't cut lettuce.  I don't know, maybe I'll do like a Sean King beard and hairline or something.  Honestly, I don't know.  Now when I holler at girls in the street, instead of thinking I'm a cool guy, they think I'm a freaking homeless person.  Yeah, what's up, girl?  How you doing?  Okay, sorry.  I'm getting cussed out by white girls now.  I can kiss jean suits goodbye.  When I put them on now, I look like a friggin' hick.  It's a Canadian tuxedo.  I'm glad someone's happy.  I talked to 50 Cent, Lil Pump, Thomas Sowell, they're all starting to turn.  Kanye got off the Trump train just in time.  It always works out for Kanye, doesn't it?  The other day I watched Tyler Perry and didn't laugh once.  Adam Sandler, on the other hand, I now love.  Yesterday I did sensitivity training at work and the girl tried to make me admit that I'm racist towards black people.  Bitch, I am black!  Sorry, I know I can't call girls bitches anymore without social repercussions.  Try telling people you like Dragon Ball Z as a grown white man.  Maybe I'll be like an environment guy now or something.  I don't fucking know.  Chelsea, call me to remind me that I'm black.  This is how you remind... I'm freaking singing Nickelback now.  I look like a fucking douchebag.  Hang on, dude.  That's me.  That's me now.  That's my fucking life.  I was looking forward to aging into an old black man, you know?  Big belt buckle, unreasonably fancy suits for normal life.  Some dude just gave me an atheism pamphlet.  Yesterday I drank out of a red cup and I had the urge to flip it.  I'm trying to look on the bright side.  I mean, I didn't really have that big of a dick for a black guy, so that's a positive.  I got a cab a little easier.  I guess that's something.  Not helping.  Celebrities are always right.  Take it from me.  Stay blue and stay black.  I'm not even going to try doing stand-up comedy.  It would be this.  Fucking a stool. ",
