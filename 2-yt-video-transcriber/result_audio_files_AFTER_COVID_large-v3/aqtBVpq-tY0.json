            "text": "Hey everyone, Eric Stackelbeck here.  Today on the newscast, Israel reportedly strikes Syrian and Iranian regime targets outside of Damascus.  Plus, still more mysterious explosions inside Iran.  And US and European lawmakers are teaming up to ban Hezbollah throughout Europe.  Get all the details coming up.  Hey folks, Eric Stackelbeck here.  Welcome to the Watchman Newscast.  The long hot summer in the Middle East continues and I believe it may just be getting started.  Iran, Syria, Hezbollah, we've got some breaking news updates for you today.  Before I get into it, I just want to encourage you to subscribe to the Watchman News Channel right here on YouTube and click the notification button so you get alerts Every time a new video is posted, remember, we've got the Watchman Newscast every Tuesday and Thursday.

Okay, let's get into it now.  I'm coming to you from Studio B today.  Over the next two weeks or so, we will be filming here.  I am in the process of moving, which is never pleasant, but it's a good thing overall.  So just expect not the usual studio, but I've got a lot of rave reviews about the brick wall, so maybe I'll stick with it.  Who knows?  But let's get into it.  Yesterday, Monday, July 20th, yet again, we have a reported Israeli strike against Iranian and Syrian regime targets outside of the Syrian capital of Damascus.  Now, a Syrian opposition group, anti-Assad group that is based in London released this report.  They've been very credible and accurate most of the time with their on the ground reports and information out of Syria throughout the past nine years with all the chaos and civil war going on in that country.  They say that Israeli airstrikes targeted Iranian and Syrian regime military sites inside Syria.  Again, right outside the capital of Damascus, at least seven of these regime fighters were reportedly injured.  Now, Israel has not claimed responsibility.  Usually they don't, unless it's really big.  Israel usually will stay mum about this, but we do know, and Israeli officials, defense officials have said, look, we have carried out hundreds, of strikes against Iran and Assad and Hezbollah and various other radical actors inside Syria over the past several years.  It looks like this is one in that chain, one more attack.  There was no retaliation as of yet.  Usually when these attacks happen, Assad is fuming.  He and his regime forces will maybe issue a threat and blame the Zionist entity.  Iran Hezbollah might say some things.  If it's a really major strike that sets them back in a serious way, you may see some attempted retaliation.  But the point is, that this is the war between wars, as Israeli officials call it.  It continues.  Speaking of that, this Thursday night and Friday afternoon on TBN, I mentioned the Watchman television show.  We've got an exclusive briefing with top officials from the Israel Defense Forces.  You will want to check that out, folks.  If you don't live in the States, you can catch it here on YouTube over the weekend.  We will post it here.  But my point is, they made clear to me This is the war between wars.  Basically, what we're seeing right now, the strikes in Syria, the flare-ups along the Israel-Lebanon border in Gaza, perhaps the mysterious explosions inside Iran, which we will address in a second.  That is all the precursor.  It's all the run-up.  All the chess pieces are moving on the board in the run-up to the big one.  As you know, if you watch a newscast on a regular basis, we call it the Great Northern War.  It is coming.  It's a question not of if but when.  It is coming, and it will pit Israel against Hezbollah and the Iranian regime and various radical Iranian-sponsored forces in southern Lebanon and in Syria.  It's going to be a major, major conflict, folks.  It is absolutely coming.  Not only is Israel prepared for it, they're prepared for it, I should say.  I've been at drills with the Israel Defense Forces, nighttime drills on the Golan Heights, tank drills.  And they are preparing.  They know the stakes.  They know what is coming.  They are very aware, again, that it's not if but when this conflict comes.  They don't want it.  But Iran and Hezbollah are forcing it upon Israel because literally they are shaping policy around their ideology.  When the Iranian regime says they intend to wipe Israel off the map, folks, you must believe them.  because clearly this rhetoric that they use is being put into action.  What I mean by that is they're saying they want to wipe Israel off the map and they are taking concrete, tangible steps to do just that.  Why else would they surround the tiny nation of Israel, which is the size of the state of New Jersey, on all sides with hundreds of thousands of rockets and missiles?  with proxies, Hezbollah, other radical Shia militias in Lebanon, Syria, with Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hamas in Gaza.  There's a method to the madness, and it is madness, but their method is the destruction of Israel.  They are true believers.  Now, if you're watching this newscast, you probably realize that, but we live in times where common sense is not so common, and I feared that many Western leaders believe that Iran's rhetoric is just kind of a bluster for domestic consumption.  It's anything but that.  I think the vast majority of the Iranian people say, why are we so, not I think, I know because I've interviewed them.  Why are we so preoccupied with Israel and the Palestinians?  When our economy is struggling and we need so many advancements right here inside Iran.  Let's focus on Iran first.  Why are we worrying about countries thousands of miles away?  That's what the average Iranian believes.  But the regime does not believe that.  They do not feel that way.  They are fixated, obsessed with a demonic obsession.  I don't use that word lightly.  A demonic evil obsession with destroying the state of Israel.  So it should come as no surprise to anyone watching, to any Western lawmaker, that they are taking active steps to do just that, including establishing military and terror bases inside Syria at Israel's doorstep to complement the base they already have in southern Lebanon, also at Israel's doorstep, in the form of Hezbollah and its 150,000, at least, rockets and missiles that are pointed at every inch of Israel.  Again, if you're watching this newscast, you probably realize this already, but many out there may not.  They say, look, if Iran got the bomb, they would never, ever use it.  Really.  Their track record says otherwise and their rhetoric is not just rhetoric.  They're putting it into action.  So, considering that, It should come as no surprise, number one, that Israel continues to strike Iranian and Hezbollah and Assad regime sites inside Syria.  And secondly, this string of mysterious explosions that we have been telling you about occurring on Iranian soil, really, it's lasted about a month now.  This has gone on consistently, folks, every few days or so.  Explosions, fires at sensitive Iranian missile and nuclear sites.  And just yesterday and over the weekend, we saw it again, a major fire at an Iranian factory in northwestern Iran, a factory there.  Now, what was being produced at that factory?  That's always why I question when I see, hey, a factory was set on fire or there was an explosion like we saw last week.  Seven wooden ships in the bay at Bushehr in Iran were set on fire.  What was in the ships?  What was in the factory?  What was being produced?  I doubt it was by coincidence or just random that these sites were targeted.  Certainly not.  The first of these strikes that we saw almost a month ago now at an Iranian ballistic reported, suspected, Iranian ballistic missile underground factory in the mountains east of Tehran, the Iranian capital.  It sent a firebomb into the night sky above Tehran, kind of culminated after that with the major explosion.  Literally, a bomb went off at Natanz, an Iranian nuclear facility, nuclear plant where uranium was being enriched.  Centrifuges were spinning.  Of course, these are the kinds of components that go into the construction of a nuclear bomb.  And now we saw not only this fire in the factory, which I mentioned in the past few days, but also at the Isfahan power plant in Iran, a major fire and explosion there.  Folks, these sites, again, it's not coincidental that nuclear sites Power plants, nuclear reactors, suspected missile sites are being targeted.  Again, Israel has not claimed responsibility for any of these attacks.  Iran has pointed the finger at Israel, in particular for the Natanz attack, and they've threatened retaliation.  And there's definitely some concern in Israel.  They're on high alert.  They always are.  for some kind of Iranian retaliation.  But could it be an Iranian dissident group?  Maybe anti-regime forces inside Iran are also carrying out some of these attacks.  Who knows?  It's very murky right now, but what we do know is that Iran's missile and nuclear programs are taking a hit.  And folks, again, I said it last week, I'll say it again, That is a good thing.  In particular, that Natanz strike, analysts believe that it set back the Iranian nuclear weapons program at least by several months.  Something is going on here and the Iranian regime has egg on its face.  This is embarrassing.  It's happening throughout their country, literally in every corner of the country under their noses.  So what are they going to do?  That's the question.  Could this be a trigger?  for that big war that sadly, God forbid, I believe is coming.  We will see.  But speaking of which, and we talk about Iran and its proxies and these evil forces that are gathering, not only against Israel, key point here, but against the West, Hezbollah.  We told you back in April here on the newscast, you can go back and look in our archives.  We told you that Germany, a leading member of the European Union, banned all Hezbollah activity on German soil.  This was a big deal.  Germany, obviously the biggest economy in Europe, a major power player on the continent, banned all Hezbollah activity outright.  Now, in Europe, I'm not just talking about Hezbollah's military wing.  I'm talking about the fundraising component.  Folks on European soil, Hezbollah members and sympathizers who raise money for the military wing and mail it, ship it back to Lebanon to be used to build and obtain weapons that are used then to kill Israelis and Americans, by the way.  But let's be clear.  The military and quote unquote political wing of Hezbollah should be indistinguishable.  And that's the problem.  Many in Europe over the years have said, we abhor the military wing.  We have banned Hezbollah's military wing, but they also have a political wing and they do social work.  Isn't that great?  No, there cannot be any daylight between these two wings.  of the world's most dangerous terrorist organization.  They are one in the same.  So thankfully, Germany recognized that belatedly, but hey, better late than never.  And back in April, banned all Hezbollah activity on German soil.  now.  An update, a new development along those lines, folks, and we wished for this back in April.  We said, hey, all of Europe now needs to follow suit and follow Germany's lead here.  Well, good news.  236 American lawmakers, members of Congress, joined with European lawmakers to issue an open letter to top European Union officials urging the EU to ban Hezbollah outright.  Not just Germany, meaning not just Germany, meaning the entire European Union, France, Germany, Spain and beyond.  These lawmakers from the US and Europe are calling on the EU, all European Union member nations to ban Hezbollah activity outright throughout Europe, throughout the continent on European soil, not just the military wing, Both wings, the political wing, are diehard violent terrorists who support the military wing.  Ban them all.  That's what this letter recommends to the top officials in the European Union.  Very encouraging to see that.  And again, we see momentum building.  It's very interesting.  If you talked to me four years ago, I said, my gosh, Iran is on the march big time.  And they were, and they still are to a degree.  They're trying to continue the march, but the march has been slowed.  They are still in four Arab capitals.  I'm talking about Sana'a in Yemen, Damascus in Syria, Beirut in Lebanon, and Baghdad in Iraq.  Iran effectively controls these four Arab countries.  But their confidence, you have to say, folks, has been shattered over the past several months, especially since the past few years under the Trump administration here in the  U.S.,  which obviously has taken a much harder line with sanctions and designating the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps as a terrorist organization, and rightfully so.  The takeout of Qasem Soleimani, the terror master and the architect of that expansionist move across the region.  He's gone, and now we see Europe, surprise, surprise, maybe gathering some steam here, banning Iran's top proxy, Hezbollah, and of course, these repeated Israeli strikes against Iranian and Hezbollah targets in Syria and probably inside Iran with a series of mysterious explosions.  Not all of them, perhaps, but I think in the very least, the Natanz strike, Could have been an Israeli strike.  If it was, more power to them.  They're not going to claim responsibility for it.  I say all that to say, Iran, you have to think, is on its heels.  By the way... The regime just came clean this week and said that millions of Iranians, millions have been infected by coronavirus.  Now we wish no ill will on the Iranian people who are oppressed by this diabolical regime.  But it's interesting that for months the Iranian regime downplayed those COVID-19 numbers and now they're.  Now they're saying millions have been infected inside Iran.  Folks, the Iranian regime is on the ropes.  They are struggling.  2020 has not been kind to many, but certainly has not been kind to the Iranian regime.  And when they have their back against the wall and when an animal is wounded, what do they do?  They look to lash out.  So we will continue to keep an eye on this and give you these updates.  I say it all the time, the chess pieces are moving on the board.  Things are heating up and hey, we have so many, if you're in America, we've got COVID-19 worries, social unrest, and no matter where you are in the world, your country of origin has problems.  But man, oh man, the Middle East is the center of it all.  And there are events developing there and unfolding there that will attract all of our attention.  Very, very soon, I can guarantee you that.  But the good news is God Almighty still sits on the throne.  That's our refrain every time here on the newscast where I have to bring you, sometimes it's dire news, let's be honest, but God is in control.  He will never leave you or forsake you.  And he has his hand on Israel.  He's a promise-keeping God.  And he says throughout his word that his promises and his covenant with Israel are everlasting.  And I quote, everlasting, forever.  God uses these words.  My question is, What part of everlasting and forever do Israel's enemies not understand?  Further, what part of everlasting and forever does the replacement theology wing in Christianity, who says God is done with Israel and the Jewish people, What part of everlasting and forever do they not understand?  We must be reading a different Bible, I suppose.  Anyway, thanks for joining us today on the newscast, folks.
