Greg underscore Palast is his Twitter handle.  Greg, welcome back to the show.  I noticed when Steve Bannon got busted that Chris Kobach's name was floating around the outsides of this unsavory thing.  And immediately I thought, Greg Palast!  So tell us, what the hell is going on here? ",

We Build the Wall is basically a crime wave parading as a not-for-profit foundation.  Kobach is general counsel.  Bannon and Colfage, the guys who founded it, with Kobach, said they wouldn't take a penny, and yet they issued a check for $250,000 to Bannon, just no explanation, $100,000 to Colfage, which in fact was listed as wages, identified as wages.  They're not supposed to take the money.  That can't happen unless the general counsel says, yeah, cut those checks.  I know, look, I've got a foundation, Tom, and my general counsel, if I sent them a bill, said, listen, just wire me a quarter million bucks, what do you say, and give my friend $100,000 while you're at it, uh... the next call would be he'd have the fbi on the line in a minute and just so you know actually i did that we did but someone who tried to do you know take a couple extra bucks for our foundation.  we went to the fbi.  they're in prison.  hello mister call out what we send you a file a cake or why weren't you indicted?

And I want to know what's going on here because not only did Chris Kobach close his eyes to the checks going out.  And, you know, I worked \u2013 remember, I was an investigator with the Justice Department.  You don't bust the capos and then leave the consigliere to run free.  That's what Kobach is.  He's the consigliere to this basically racketeering enterprise.  It's a classic racketeering enterprise.  You know, you just scam the rubes.  In addition, though, now this is interesting, Tom, Kobach used the list from We Build the Wall to fundraise for his Senate campaign.  Now, the last time I looked, that's a felony go-to-jail crime.  So Kobach is using the list.  So, in other words, they're taking the money, but he has something that's more valuable to him using the list.  Though he did crank the organization.  I don't know how many people realize he got something like up to $400,000 in the past year for legal fees while he's running for the U.S.  Senate.  So, you know, we have to ask why Bannon goes down, not Kobach. ",

They would give him hundreds of thousands of dollars.  He would pretend to process data or something.  And sometimes they got left holding the bag.  Sometimes they would pass some meaningless law.

What I'm very concerned with is that you can't get a political indictment like this without the approval of the Attorney General, Mr.  Barr.  So he decided Bannon had to go, but not Kobach.  Now, remember, what I'm very concerned with, Tom, is that Bannon was the key witness with Randy Credico against Roger Stone.  So I'm very afraid of the machinations of Roger Stone behind this, getting even with the guy who almost jailed him.  And, of course, Bannon is in bad odor with the Mercer family.  He attacked Ivanka as dumber than a piece of lumber.  And so they had to get rid of Bannon.  They didn't want him around for the campaign, but they need Kobach.  So they made a very interesting decision.  You're going to take down Bannon.  But you're going to leave his co-conspirator out.  He wasn't even mentioned in the indictment.  And that's like you have to understand with Justice Department, that's impossible.  So the fix is in in some way.  And that's why while I'm very, you know, look, we're all applauding that Bannon got pantsed on this one.  But I'm very concerned about what they have in mind for Kobach and for Roger Stone in terms of mischief for this election.  Yeah. ",

Bush, you know, or 92, excuse me, the Christmas Eve massacre of 1992 when he had George W. Bush pardon Caspar Weinberger and Ollie North and all these other guys in order to blow up the Iran-Contra prosecution.  Greg, just to widen the lens a little bit, I sent five bucks off to the Trump campaign, along with a bunch of other campaigns, back in 2015, when they were just starting up, just to get on their lists.  On some days, I'll get five or six of these fundraising appeals, and they all use the same Trump-Pence logo, the same graphic logo, so they all look like they're coming from the same place.  But I'm getting them from Our President 45.  These are super PACs.  Our President 45.  I don't even remember all the names of them.  I should write them down.  Trumpisagreatman.org or whatever.  I mean, there's a half a dozen of them or so.  And I remember when Stephen Colbert did that, when super PACs first became a thing after Citizens United.  And Stephen Colbert did this thing where he ran for public office for a senator from North Carolina, as I recall.  and created a super PAC, and then he had his lawyer on afterwards and said, okay, you know, we got 100,000 bucks in the super PAC, what do I do with the money?  And his lawyer said, well, you can take it, basically.  I mean, you've gotta circumscribe slightly how you use this money, but basically you can use it to live on for the rest of your life.  And it looks to me like Trump is acquiring, and because these are super PACs, there's no campaign donation limits, that he's probably acquiring hundreds of millions of dollars that he and his grifter buddies are gonna live on for the rest of their lives.  Do you know anybody who's investigating this? ",

And by the way, just one little aside, I can't resist.  Chris Kobach, when I was investigating him for Rolling Stone and he was trying to talk me out of writing the article, he did mention to me proudly that he's the one who told Trump that the Mexicans will pay for the wall.  He told Trump how to get it done.  And yet Kobach is saying, well, the Mexicans will pay for the wall, but in the meantime, just make out the checks to me or we build the wall, which is mostly we and not much wall. ",
