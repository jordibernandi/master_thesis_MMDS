            "text": "Good morning.  Welcome to Viking Preparedness.  I am Pastor Joe Fox.  I guess I hit a nerve yesterday.  I'm going to talk about that.  Do you remember, most of you, when you learned, by whatever way you learned, that there was no Santa Claus?  Some people kind of figured it out on their own.  Some people were a little bit upset.  Many people wished for the innocence of youth and the return of the fat jolly man in the red suit, right?  And many people look back fondly on the wonders of that.  But it's a lie, right?  I saw a lot of comments that irritated me a little bit.  Not on a personal level, so if you're the one who made the comment, don't worry about it.  You just speak in your mind.  I get it.  People saying things like, well some people nothing's worth fighting for.  you know words to that effect basically in a roundabout way challenging my since I was the messenger my willingness to fight for the ideal of the United States of America or something like that newsflash gang.  I served this nation for almost 40 years 20 of it in the Army and 20 of it out.  I'll put my record of service to the nation up against any of y'all's.  Yeah.  There's that.  I saw one person say something about, I'm shocked, PJ.  I love it when people say they're shocked.  Because my first kind of knee-jerk reaction, you know how I told you all before I have the knee-jerk reaction when someone says you have to or you can't?  I automatically, at least in my head, think what if I don't or what if I do?  When someone says I'm shocked, that's another thing I automatically knee-jerk on.  And I'm like, what about this?  do you find shocking?  How could you not know this, see this?  I'm shocked.  Shocked, I tell you.  You're winning, sir.  What did he say he was shocked about?  I'm shocked, PJ.  Oh, you're the one who always tells us never quit.  Never say die.  Yeah.  On a worthy, hopeful cause.  We'll get into that.  I need more of this.  It's early.  Sun's not up.  I spent the bulk of my career in Special Forces.  And Special Forces, The role has changed a little bit.  There's actually talk in our circles, the special forces intelligentsia academic circles, about which way are we going with special forces.  But in a nutshell, it was designed for guerrilla warfare or to counter guerrilla warfare.  If you can train and raise guerrillas, you can train and raise counter guerrillas, right?  And so you need to understand that about me.  I am very good at guerrilla warfare.  And you don't fight battles you can't win.  You run away.  Hit and run.  Come back and fight when the terms are more favorable.  So being shocked about that.  Never say die, never quit.  Absolutely.  When you're engaged in a task in which you can win.  Do you remember how we started out talking about Santa?  Many people, and I was one of them for a long time, so I get where you're coming from.  I do.  And I'm going to, in a way, slay some sacred cows.  And you're not going to like it.  And some people may even quit.  And if you do, if you quit over emotion, then quit.  I, as I've gotten older and have more time to widen my lens... and what I get to think about and do because I'm not super focused on one thing.  We've got to go there and do this mission and get out, and it takes all of my creative energy.  I'm not living that life anymore.  I have a broader perspective.  I've been looking at human history a lot.  So has Sister Kate.  Human history.  I remember when my wife said, you know, Americans think that our country is old.  And I was in a pub, a no-name pub in Britain, sitting at a table that was made before our country was born.  Just having a pint at a table older than our country.  We Americans are very new.  We're very forward looking in a cultural way.  And we think that 200 years is a long time.  It's not.  It's not.  And so if you look at human history, the nation state, America, Germany, France, China, as a united nation state as the people and and functions and and uh... need more coffee uh... institutions a nation state a country what many people call a country relatively new thing in humanity and i submit In many ways, it's a Santa Claus.  Anymore, it's only an illusion.  The real players, the real movers and shakers, are no longer concerned with nation-states.  It's a useful distraction for the masses.  Does anyone know what nationality Soros is?  Do you think he cares what his passport says?  He doesn't.  They use it as a means to an end.  I'm going somewhere with this.  It's early.  I believe... And I hope I'm wrong.  How about that?  I believe and I hope I'm wrong.  I believe that the time of the nation state is going away.  And we're going back more to empires that are not necessarily comprised of nation states.  You know, the ancient empires, Persia, Babylon, whatever, Greece, Rome, they weren't made up of countries as we know them today.  They were made up of little big tribes.  Coming together.  And those tribes, even the Greek nation states were really tribes in many ways.  Those tribes had what we don't have today.  Lack of diversity as an individual unit.  The people of this tribe looked like this tribe, talked like this tribe, acted like this tribe, worshipped like this tribe, carried themselves like this tribe.  They would be either joined together with other tribes.  They would join together with other tribes, whether that was forced or they wanted to, and then go fight for the greater empire.  I think that this grand experiment of democracy is coming to an end.  I tell you to read Sir John Glove.  Read it.  If you haven't read it, go read it.  The American Empire is dying.  And it's a death throes.  And we were an empire.  And someone else is going to replace us.  And I think probably there's a good chance it'll be China as the world empire, as the major factor on the world scene.  That's one.  Number two, read your Bible.  Read your Bible.  Somebody said something about this nation.  may be Babylon, but it's worth saving.  Okay, if you're coming at this from a Christian perspective, what about this country do you think is worth saving?  This country that slaughters babies by the boatload with abortion.  This country that passes laws that go in the face, fly in the face of God.  The country passes laws that do.  And you know me, guys.  I'm not that political, and I try not to be that religious here.  But I'm talking to those who are the Christians who made some comments about that.  And you think this country should stand?  Why?  Come out of her, my people, so that you don't partake of her sins and receive of her plagues.  Well, there are plagues coming.  Oh, yeah.  And they're going to start in the cities.  They are going to start in the cities.  Nothing new I've been saying.  You're just getting a deeper slice of the pie cake.  whatever lasagna if the father has decided that this country needs to fall because of the way we act as a country not talking individuals as a nation state and it needs to fall why in the heck would you want to defend it?  why in the heck would you want to slow that fall?  You should embrace it because it's Yah's will.  There's still people here, and most of you are more level-headed than that, who in effect are saying, no way, man, I'm still young enough to fight.  I'm going to fight.  Who the hell are you going to fight?  Who are you going to shoot?  Who is leading you?  See, that's how you know.  this thing's corrupt to the core.  People like us, you, me, we care, right?  We do care.  I get it.  I care too.  I'm just seeing further ahead and saying, oh, this is where it's going, so I'm switching course.  We care, and we're upset at what's going on.  Okay.  What are the Congress critters doing?  What are all the Republicans whose president is being stolen, right?  Their Republican president, Trump.  What are all the Republican senators doing?  What are the Republican representatives doing?  What are they saying?  What are the governors, the Republican governors saying?  Nothing, nothing.  And so who are you going to go fight for?  What ideal are you fighting for at that point?  The country's done.  It's done.  It's not there.  It's Santa Claus.  It's your idea of the country.  And if you think you're going to go rebuild a country or build a new nation, you start where you are.  You start where you are.  And that's what I've been saying the whole time.  The whole time.  Come out of her, my people.  See to your circles.  Expand your circles.  Your circle starts with your household.  If you can't lead your household, you're not worthy of leading anybody else.  That's biblical too, by the way.  If you can't lead your clan, your neighborhood... You got some fantasy about driving across the country to do something.  For who?  Nobody in any real position of powers supporting you.  They don't care.  They know the gig is up, the jig is up.  What are you fighting for, Santa's honor?  I'm fighting for Santa Claus's honor.  Santa Claus doesn't exist.  I know that's pissing some of you off.  Remember, I've been at this game longer than most of y'all as far as defending the nation.  I would love to see America strong and bold again.  I loved growing up in one of two superpowers and seeing that transition to the sole superpower in the world.  It's comforting going to bed at night knowing no one is going to roll tanks through my street.  I want that for my grandchildren.  One in one hand, crap in the other.  Tell me what you got.  If wishes were horses, beggars would ride.  I try to see what's coming.  I try to look ahead.  And I try to choose the best course of action to get through what's coming.  And again, if you have some fantasy about dying on a hill holding a flag that the powers that be don't care about, knock yourself out.  I've got more to do.  I have real people for whom I am responsible.  People, it's time to start thinking locally.  When this whole thing breaks apart, and I think it will, the stronger you are locally, the better off you're gonna have it.  We're getting tribal, baby.  It's coming.  Not this, this.  How long have I been telling you, get with people.  Join a tribe, find a tribe, make a tribe.  This is why.  The warlords are fixing to rise.  They're already doing it.  This thing's going to fragment.  It's Humpty Dumpty.  All the king's horses and all the king's men can't put Humpty back together again.  Who knew Pastor Fox would be talking about Humpty Dumpty and Santa Claus?  To your tents.  See to your tents.  See to your people.  Maybe.  I'll see you out there. ",
