            "text": "I have debated for quite some time in my spirit how to share this with people, because I'm going to be telling you a vision that I experienced, not a dream, but a vision that I experienced about 15 years ago.  I wrote it down.  Most of my staff have heard me share this a couple times over the years, but I believe it's very possible that we're about to see it come to pass.  NOW FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE WATCHING ME, THERE'S TWO GROUPS OF PEOPLE.  THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE KNOWN ME FOR 10, 20, 30, AND 40 YEARS WHO HAVE KEPT UP WITH MY MINISTRY AND HAVE HEARD ME TALK ABOUT TIMES.  THAT THE LORD WOULD SHOW ME SOMETHING, AND THEY WOULD ACTUALLY WATCH IT.  COME TO PASS THREE, FOUR, OR FIVE YEARS LATER.  One was a vision in Brooksville, Florida in 1998, in which I saw the trade center shrouded in black with five grayish tornadoes spinning off of the building.  And there was papers and computer papers inside of those tornadoes.  And there was even sparks that you could see a fire.  Now, I had an artist draw this out in 1999, and I got to the point I was thinking, well, maybe it's a Y2K computer mainframe.  I didn't know what it meant.  I just knew it looked like the Trade Center.  And when 9-11 happened and the two Trade Centers, the planes flew in, the black smoke went up, they both collapsed, and those tornado-looking, the dust that looked grayish is exactly what I described for five years to people about this vision.  And I didn't know it would be planes flying into the Trade Center, but Trade Center 1 and 2 fell, and there was five tornadoes, and then 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, the other buildings were completely affected and actually destroyed by that.  And so that was something I told five years before.  And then there was the THE VISION OF THE, RIGHT OFF OF THE GULF OF LOUISIANA, SEEING AN OIL TORNADO, A TORNADO OF BLACK OIL COMING OUT OF THE WATER NEAR AN OIL RIG.  AND I TOLD PASTORS AND FRIENDS OF MINE, DINO RIZO FROM HEALING PLACE AT THAT TIME WAS ONE OF THE PASTORS, THERE'S GOING TO BE A PROBLEM, SOMETHING WITH OIL OFF THE GULF OF, COAST OF LOUISIANA.  AND THAT'S WHEN THE EXPLOSION TOOK PLACE, IF YOU'LL REMEMBER.  And when they showed the pictures under the water of the oil coming out, it was like a black spinning tornado.  And listen, I actually drew this out of the five things that would affect that I saw in the vision.  And all five of those things literally happened.  And I went to Healing Place Church many years ago and preached about the vision.  We prayed that night that God would find a solution to the oil coming out of that hole where that rig had been.  And it was like a week later, the story I heard was a Christian man came up with the way to stop that up.  And of course it was stopped.  Now there's other things I could share with you, but those are two of the most notable incidents that people have heard me talk about long before they happened.  This particular one I've never shared publicly because honestly, I didn't know how it would happen or what it meant.  And I say I haven't, perhaps I have at some point, but I don't remember, but I do know.  My closest friends, and I've got witnesses that's watching me tape this right now, remember me talking about this for many years.  Today I'm going to share with you the empty cities that were in the United States that I saw.  About 15 years ago, I was in a deep sleep and suddenly carried away by the Holy Spirit to a city.  Now, this was a vision.  This was not a dream.  My office manager, Charlie Ellis, was in a car with me, and I remember clearly driving that car down a road, and I could even see trees and sidewalks over here, and there was a city over to our right.  And all of a sudden, the car came to a complete halt.  It was so sudden.  I remember it wasn't like a gradual halt.  It was that quick.  And I said, what just happened?  Goodness, what has just happened?  The car, suddenly there's no movement.  And Charlie said, I don't know, let's get out and see what's taking place.  And we got out of the car, and I began to look, and I was in a city, I was in a US city.  Now, I'll be honest with you, it didn't look like any city I recognized, but it did have large skyscrapers with modern buildings.  And I remember looking at it, and to my amazement, all the people were inside, but there was nobody on the street, and I mean nobody.  There were no taxis in operation, no buses, no children playing on the sidewalks, no people shopping.  I mean, it was like this entire city was completely shut down.  I remember that we have, we have to this day, these black anvil cases that we take on the road to our larger meetings and they carry our product and sometimes electronic equipment we need to tape the services,  etc.,  I remember Charlie and I, and there were several other workers with me, and I would have to go back to my notes to get all of their names.  And I remember trying to push the case toward the city and it would not go.  I said, we've got to get these cases to the city because there's a meeting plan.  We have to be in the meeting.  Talking about a gospel meeting, of course.  When those cases did not move, I clearly remember unlocking them and lifting the lid.  And instead of seeing my resource product or electronic equipment in the cases, there was a silver trumpet.  It was very large.  And I grabbed that silver trumpet.  Now we know that silver trumpets in the Bible IN NUMBERS 10 ARE FOR THE CALLING OF THE CAMP AND THE JOURNEY OF THE ASSEMBLY.  WE ALSO KNOW THAT SILVER TRUMPETS ARE BLOWN ON THE YEAR OF THE JUBILEE.  AND SO SILVER TRUMPETS ARE VERY SIGNIFICANT IN SCRIPTURE, AND SILVER DOES REPRESENT REDEMPTION.  And I blew that trumpet and it wouldn't blow.  It was a very long trumpet, but it wouldn't blow, pure silver.  I lifted up the second case and I pulled out of that a stem of a trumpet to hook to this one to extend the sound.  It would not go, it would not blow.  And I'm blowing it toward the city.  Nothing's happening, no movement.  And there were at least three cases, possibly four.  And again, I have these notes, and I actually looked for them before I came on to this with you, and I couldn't find them.  They could be with 25,000 books upstairs or in five different desks anywhere.  And if I find those, I'll show those to you, the notes that I made that night 15 years ago or so, perhaps a little longer, right around 15 years ago.  And I remembered saying to the group... There will be no church meetings of our own, speaking of myself, in this city.  Something has happened.  For many years, especially during the times when there would be a war in the Gulf or there would be an uprising in the Middle East or there would be a tanker with oil that would have been blown up somewhere, I thought that perhaps... And this is me thinking, not the Holy Spirit, this is me, that there would be a disruption in oil and we would not be able to get to where we're going because oil prices would be high, gas would be high, people would not be driving.  But then that didn't make sense the more I thought about it because even though prices would be high, people should still be working, there should be taxis, there should be buses, there should be transportation available.  Nothing's moving.  I know that you have seen this the way I have, that China shut down an entire city and all the activity.  If people were on the street, they were arrested.  There were actually people that were beaten if they were on the street.  And people on the inside said it came to a complete shutdown in the city of China where this coronavirus began.  But in the United States, we're beginning to see things happen.  We're beginning to see the shutting down of ballgames, sports events, church gatherings, church events, theaters, universities.  All because of this particular virus that is deemed quite dangerous, especially if it continues to spread, because this particular one did not have a particular vaccine that had been prepared knowing that it was about to come.  I believe we're going to go into a season, and this is what I pray.  I pray that God will be merciful to us, that God will somehow stop this particular virus out there, shorten its length of effectiveness, and have mercy on us as a nation.  That's my prayer.  That's how we should pray.  But in that prayer of asking for help, we need to ask God to forgive us as a nation.  for shedding innocent blood and for mocking traditional marriage and for taking prayer out of school and Bible reading out of school and not allowing God himself who created us to even be a part of our life.  So I want you to hear me for just a moment.  I believe if this is the meaning of the dream, and I'm going to always put if there because we're not there yet, but we could be.  that there will be a lot of closures in where.  if this were to spread, and hopefully it's being contained, but if it were to spread or something would come along behind it like a second strand, it would be possible that areas and cities would go on lockdown and people would be confined to stay inside where they are, disrupting life as we know it.  I never saw the end of this.  I do know that each trumpet could represent a month, I certainly hope each trumpet doesn't represent a year, because that would be three years of difficulty.  Three weeks, three months, three years, I don't know.  I'm not going to speculate on what I don't know.  But I will tell you this, and I want you to hear me for just a moment.  In the Bible... There was a rebellion that arose among the people of God.  They rebelled against their leadership, Moses, and they began to criticize and mock him, and God became angry.  And God said to Moses, I'm going to plague the people because of their rebellion.  They're stiff-necked, they're hard-hearted, they're stubborn, and they won't listen to me.  And a plague came, and when the plague came, the people cried out to God.  When the plague came, the people turned to God.  Moses sent Aaron, who was the high priest, to stand between the living and the dead.  This is in the book of Numbers, I believe, chapter 16.  And he took censers filled with incense.  The Bible says the incense represents our prayers in Psalms and also in the book of Revelation.  And he stood between the plagued, those who were dying, and the living.  He risked his life because that plague could have come on him.  But between the dead and the living, he stood between the two.  And when he did, the plague was stayed forever.  because Moses was an intercessor of the intercede on behalf of the people.  Let me just say this to all of you right now.  This is no time to get political and make this a political issue that some politicians are doing.  This is no time for people to be so fearful that they lose their faith in God and they're not praying.  God did not give us a spirit of fear, but power, love and a sound mind.  This is the time for all of us, myself, my staff and all people included to turn to God and say, God, we need your help.  I hope the president will call a national day of fasting and prayer.  President Trump will do that.  I hope he will.  I believe he's a man that understands spiritual things and he is surrounded by spiritual people, at least.  Many, many ministers and preachers that have his ear.  Mr.  President, we need prayer and we need fasting.  Abraham Lincoln did it.  Presidents in the past did it.  And there's no reason why you can't call it as well.  It must come from the top.  And let the skeptics criticize.  Let the liberals rage.  Because without the help of God, this could go on a long time.  Without the help of God, it could be a lot more worse than it could possibly be now.  We need his intervention.  And I'm sharing this with you because I felt released that I should and I could.  And the biggest thing I will tell you is as a believer, you're in covenant with God.  You're under the blood of Jesus.  Do not fear.  Do not be afraid of what men would do to you.  No weapon formed against you shall prosper.  The blood of Jesus overcomes the powers of the enemy.  Jesus said, you have authority in my name to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the powers of the enemy and nothing shall by any means harm you.  Claim, believe, pray, and confess the promises of God.  I will be doing some very special updates in the future and I'm coming into my studio to actually put together some things.  That I want to make available to people who are interested in deeper study of where we're headed prophetically.  I thank those of you who are partners in my ministry.  And I thank those of you who stand with us and those of you that support us.  We have 50 staff members working for you on a consistent basis.  So thank you for your support.  Thank you for your prayers.  And God bless you.  And don't forget to stand in the gap and make up the hedge for this nation. ",
