            "text": "Oh, hello, Franklin and Jerry.  Welcome, pool boy and personal fitness assistant.  Suzette, please get these charming young men some shirts and a beverage while Jerry and Franklin and I talk.  Oh, Jerry, where do you find the energy?  Listen, the reason I invited you over today is to talk about a delicate dilemma.  I'm getting rather concerned about this encroaching cancel culture.  because I have some bad news for you too.  Apparently people are figuring out that those Confederate statues you're so fond of were not put up after the Civil War to remember history.  No, most were put up right after Reconstruction to remind non-whites who was boss during Jim Crow and then again later during the Civil Rights era.  so the South could thumb its nose at the Supreme Court and Congress.  Same reason Georgia added the Confederate battle flag to its state flag.  Not even during the Civil War, but after Brown v. Board of Education told it to desegregate its schools.  Not exactly subtle, so.  My only surprise was that it's taken so long for the rest of the country to catch on.  Anyway, boys, we are just remembering history, sham.  It's kaput.  It brings me to something that was used by the South to justify the peculiar institution before and during the Civil War, the Bible.  After all, the Bible endorses slavery.  Franklin, there's nothing funny about slavery and there's nothing reassuring about the Bible failing to condemn it.  No, it really doesn't, Jerry.  Well, look it up when you get home.  Really, you don't own a Bible?  Oh, that explains so much.  Well, you can take one of mine, cash only.  Just not the autographed one.  Well, of course the Bible being okay with slavery makes you like it even more, Jerry, but that's not the point.  No, Franklin.  The problem is both testaments, but as always the case, old is worse.  Exodus 21 addresses owning Jewish slaves, and Leviticus 25 is all about shopping for foreign ones.  Guess which are treated better?  Ownership of the foreign slaves only expires when they do.  You can even pass them on to your kids.  What was the Lord thinking?  But the Jewish slaves, you have to free after six years, unless you don't see the fine print in Exodus 21 for details, like whether you have to give them the wife and kids as part of their severance package now.  I've talked to pastor and he said the best way to explain away the Lord's appalling endorsement of owning slaves is just to say, oh.  But slavery was so different back in ancient times.  Back then, it was really like something out of Downton Abbey.  That glib spin is made a bit difficult by Exodus 20 to 21.  If you beat your slave with a rod, you can't be punished if they recover after two days.  Since the slave is your property, leave it to the Lord to say the most problematic thing ever.  especially as Proverbs 30, 5-6 tells us every word of God is perfect.  How trump is that?  And Jesus wasn't any help.  He condemned a fig tree for not bearing fruit out of season, but he didn't condemn humanity for its most amoral practice.  owning other humans.  Oh yes, Jesus healed slaves, but he sure didn't free any.  He used slaves as metaphors in parables, he told, but he never told anyone.  it was a sin to own one.  So if the issue comes up, be careful asking yourself, what would Jesus do?  No, who am I kidding?  Like you two would ever do that.  So this is why I worry that the Bible will get canceled.  And this concerns me for the same reason.  it will concern you.  It may affect our bottom line.  You may not have a conscience, but you both have gift shops.  I know what you're both thinking.  Why worry about what the Bible says?  It's not like any of us.  read it, much less follow it.  But atheists can be rather sneaky, so underhanded.  They will actually read the Bible before telling people what it says and then throw it back in our faces, which is super awkward.  Are you kidding, Franklin?  Have you not read it either?  Open one sometime, even only for the novelty.  Crazy talking.  Snakes and donkeys, a guy with a condo in a whale, sending two bears to murder 42 kids, a dowry of 100 foreskins?  Really?  Anyway, all of that pales to endorsing the human stain of slavery.  Why?  Well, for one thing, it sort of undercuts our marketing the Bible as not a compendium of human thoughts from 2,000 plus years ago, but a book of timeless moral truths from an all-knowing God.  An all-knowing God who backed the wrong side in the Civil War.  Here's the irony of canceling the Bible.  If you don't like something, the best way to stop it from happening is for the Bible to endorse it.  Because we always do the opposite of what the Bible tells us to, honestly.  If the Bible condemned slavery, conservative Christian America would probably still be doing it.  Of course, in an unforgivable way, America still is. ",
