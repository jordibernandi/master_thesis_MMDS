            "text": "hello everyone and welcome to the vortex where lies and falsehoods are trapped and exposed.  i'm michael voris.  when a candidate picks a vice president there's usually a solid reason for landing on that person.  either they can carry a state on election day or they fill in a gap on the presidential nominee's resume like in foreign policy for example.  So Biden's pick of Kamala Harris is proving to be quite weird, practically brain dead, in fact.  First, she's from California, hardly a state that threatens to turn red, so no help there.  And Kamala Harris has no real experience in anything significant other than screeching at and blasting and haranguing Brett Kavanaugh during his Supreme Court hearings.  During her term in the U.S.  Senate, she has sponsored no bills of import, but just signed on to the usual list of Marxist claptrap.  While she was in California as Attorney General before that, in a far more friendly Marxist environment, she was able to beat back pro-lifers and advance the cause of same-sex marriage.  She's been picked by Biden because she's a woman and he was under intense pressure from Marxists.  to pick a black woman, which every single person on earth understands means African-American, not just someone who doesn't have white skin.  You know, descendants of slaves, grown up in poverty, victims of white privilege, all of that.  But Kamala checks none of those boxes, not a single one.  For starters, her father admits in an online biography seen here that he is descended from Irishmen and his side of the family owned a plantation in Jamaica complete with slaves.  Yep, slaves.  You heard right.  Kamala is a descendant of slave owners.  Likewise, she has absolutely zero biological ties to the African-American community.  She is not descended from sharecroppers.  Her ancestors were not kidnapped from Africa and chained in slave ship galleys and sold in markets.  None of that applies to her.  And that's just her father's side.  Her mother's side is even less applicable to the whole question of racism aimed at blacks.  Her mother's family is from Madras, India.  Mom was a cancer researcher who met and married Kamala's father in Berkeley, California in the 1960s when they were working and studying together.  A few years later, her parents divorced, mom got a nice job at a Canadian university, and Kamala, with her younger sister, went to live with her mother, where she grew up in a racist-free environment in Montreal.  Kamala has, in fact, had none of the usual experience of what everyone understands as the American Black experience.  She's Jamaican and Indian.  At least Obama was half Black.  Kamala is no Black, commonly understood.  Likewise, to curry favor with the non-blacks.  when she was attorney general of California, she pursued a vigorous anti-crime policy which massively drove up incarceration rates of young black men.  That's something her running mate Joe Biden also did when he was in the U.S.  Senate, the same man who also verbally opposed desegregation in schooling.  Kamala actually ripped him on stage at the party's primary debates for being a racist. ",

            "text": "it's kind of curious all this a racist man who keeps insulting blacks with condescending comments and a fake african-american woman who is not of african descent but jamaican and indian who will now march off together on a blacks need to vote for us because we are woke campaign which will prove to be one of the most hypocritical shams in the history of u.s politics.  Likewise, a whole host of other weird questions arise from this pick.  Kamala said she believes Tara Reid, the woman on Biden's staff back in the day, who ultimately accused him of sexual assault.  Harris flat out said she believes Tara Reid.  So on top of accusing Biden of being a segregationist, meaning a racist, she also believes her running mate is a rapist.  Out of her own mouth, she has accused Biden of being a racist and a rapist.  Don't forget those points.  She's descended from slave owners and thinks her running mate is a rapist and a racist.  You can't make this stuff up.  Add on to the list that she herself is a public anti-Catholic bigot.  In 2018, in the Senate confirmation hearings for Brian Butcher for a federal judgeship, Kamala went off on him for his membership in the Knights of Columbus, specifically because the Catholic organization is opposed to abortion and same-sex marriage.  In short, Kamala was applying a religious litmus test to a federal judgeship.  Catholics had better beware of this monstrous ticket of fake Catholic Biden and anti-Catholic Kamala.  But the Marxist media won't tell you all that.  In fact, they don't know what truth and accuracy is.  Anything, absolutely anything, any idea, policy, or proposal they don't like is automatically tagged as violent.  At the same time, they portray actual violent attacks against innocent Americans, business owners, and police officers as mostly peaceful protests.  It's all surreal, like we've stepped through Alice's looking glass.  A spoiled, pampered girl profiting from a system built on their imagined white privilege in another country whose lineage includes actual bona fide slave owners manages to now be in the vice presidential slot for the United States.  All this victimization, it's horrible, the poor dear.  Neither the media nor Kamala herself can go near this third rail.  She cannot admit her lineage lest the truth come out.  And if she admits it and blames it on the past that she had nothing to personally do with, then the whole BLM argument blows up in their collective Marxist face.  Remember when Elizabeth Warren had to out and out lie about her Native American heritage to gain advancement?  Well, how's Kamala's story any different?  She lies when she calls herself African-American with everything that that imports in 21st century America.  And if the campaign wants to try and hide behind the line that some Jamaicans came from Africa a zillion years ago, well, everyone in America can play that game.  So everybody is both every ethnicity and no ethnicity.  The Dems play the race card.  They use identity politics to get elected.  They even go so far as to nominate a descendant of slave owners.  So every actual black woman in the Democratic Party should be asking right now, what's wrong with us, the actual descendants of slaves, as opposed to a descendant of slave owners?  The Dems do have racism high on their list of issues, just not in the way they pretend.  In that way, much of the U.S.  hierarchy resembles the Democrats, harping on about fake issues of social justice and the environment in order to advance worldwide Marxism.  It's going to be a heck of a remaining 80 days or so.  God love you.  I'm Michael Voris. ",
