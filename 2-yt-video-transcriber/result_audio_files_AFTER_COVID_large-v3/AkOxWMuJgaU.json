I'm just paying my stay in here, and I want to make sure it gets done right.  Those cameras get lost and destroyed.  This one does not.  Good.  A piece of paper and a video is double good.

And the Florida wiretapping law does not have any expectation in public.  This is a public building.  This is not a private conversation we're having.  This is a public service that's being provided.  Read the law again.  I know what I'm doing.  I got thrown in jail for this.  They're wrong.  Don't add on to it, please.  It's not a threat.  I'm just telling you.  I'm sorry that your comfort levels, you can't control them.  I'm making sure that my comfort levels are in control.  I can do this.  It's within my right that I'm comfortable that I'm paying my bills.  Okay, thank you.  You're a public servant.  You're supposed to be glad that I'm comfortable.  Okay, swipe your card.
