            "text": "Gentlemen, welcome back to episode 209 of MGTOW Money.  Today's topic, fired for the third time.  Before I get into that, thanks to the ongoing support from the Patreon investors in this channel.  Thank you guys for continuing to support this channel.  And again, no thank you for YouTube as they continue to do what they can to destroy not just this channel, but any remnants of MGTOW left on YouTube.  In particular, of course, as you may or may not know, the demonetizing all channels and now furthermore age restricting many videos including videos on this channel.  so goes without saying gentlemen i appreciate your support patreon supporters.  And oh, by the way, because I know a lot of you have a lot of downtime right now and have had a lot of downtime, let me give you a quick book recommendation, an excellent one.  See the video description for this book.  The book title, Break the Twitch, A Practical Guide to Minimalism, Intentional Living, and Doing More of What Matters.  A short little book.  It's got some interesting ideas.  I recommend it.  Again, see the video description for a link to that book.  And Before I get into today's topic, by the way, go back and see some of the prior videos I've discussed that are applicable to today's economic environment.  What do you do when we're going into a recession?  What sort of jobs should you be considering?  What to do if you're in tough, tough times like I know a lot of you are.  I think there's some real world practical things that you can do.  right now today to get yourself out of this or at least to move yourself up from where you are right now.  All right, let's get into today's topic.  Fired for the third time.  Did you get fired recently?  I don't know about you.  If you did not get fired, you are extremely lucky because evidently unemployment, at least in the United States, is running around 25 to 35%.  And to put that in context, in the Great Depression, you know, during the 1930s, at the peak, at the absolute top, it was 25%.  So right now in the United States, we have roughly Great Depression levels of unemployment with tens of millions of people having no job.  Yes, there's unemployment and that type of thing, but that presumably is not going to continue forever.  Furthermore, you know, it reminds me of when I was in my early 30s.  I'm in my office, high-rise office building, working for a very large corporation, S&P 500 company, offices throughout the United States, multi-billion dollar company.  Guy stuck his head in my office when I was on the phone and he interrupted me and he said, hey, Some airplanes just hit the Twin Towers in New York.  I'm like, what are you talking about?  That's ridiculous.  And so I hung up the phone.  We went to somebody else had a TV or something or radio in their office.  And I remember watching this.  I couldn't believe it.  I could not imagine what was going on.  And the reason why this is so important today is because nine months later, eight months later, whatever it was, I was out of a job.  I was fired.  Now fired, laid off.  OK, regardless, I was let go.  I was told, you no longer have a job here.  We are no longer going to pay you for any work whatsoever.  Get out, in so many words.  So the point is, that was my, oh, third time that I can remember.  I think there might have been more, but at least the third time I had been fired in my working life.  And so my point is, is that one, guess what, men?  It's okay.  I've been through it.  Lots of us have been through it.  And you too will get through this.  I can promise you that.  You'll get through this.  As a matter of fact, I got fired another time, at least another time after that time.  So I've been fired at least, that I can remember, four times throughout my working life.  So again, you're going to get through this.  And most importantly though, forgetting about what happened, why did it happen, should it have happened, should all these things be going on, I'm going to leave all that aside for just a second.  I want you to focus on Three takeaways, three action steps that you can do now, that you can implement now in your life to make things better.  Because this is what I'm going to tell you right now.  You think this is tough.  You think you're going through a hard situation.  I get it.  But you know what?  You will.  I almost guarantee you, as I'm already describing, probably go through other very difficult situations.  Don't assume just because you make it through this situation... that, hey, it's all going to be bed and roses for the rest of my life and everything's going to be smooth as glass.  No, I virtually guarantee you, you are going to have other issues, whether you choose to get married and probably get divorced, whether you end up bankrupt at some point, whether you get fired three or four times like myself, whether you get seriously ill, some illness strikes you, whatever.  The point is that you're going to have other serious crises that are going to happen.  And so there are three things you've got to start doing right now.  You've got to put in a fact to your life right now to really help yourself.  one get your biggest expense down today.  right now.  start focusing on getting your very big biggest expense to as low a possible dollar amount.  Specifically, your biggest controllable expense is housing.  How much you're paying for a roof over your head.  Now, I'm leaving aside those of you who might be living with your parents.  I'm talking, of course, to adults.  Adults don't live with their parents.  Adults live on their own and they take care of themselves.  You need to focus on how low can you go.  I've used that term before.  It is a very important phrase.  You need to frequently ask yourself, how low can you go?  You've got to get your base expense down.  and housing for most people is their very biggest expense.  getting that down as low as possible I can virtually guarantee you will make your life much much easier throughout your entire life.  if you can adjust yourself to a low expense lifestyle in terms of housing it will be much easier Now, if you start saying to me, well, I live in a particular part of the world where housing is very, very expensive.  I'm going to talk about that next.  Two, move.  Stay mobile.  Whatever you do, don't be attached.  Don't get stuck.  Don't feel like, well, I can't move.  Yes, you can move.  You can move.  You might be able to come up with 101 excuses about why you can't move.  But almost none of those excuses are legitimate.  Look, unless you've got some sort of legal restriction or some sort of physical handicap that literally makes it impossible for you to move, you can move.  You can change your residence.  You can move to a lower cost of living area in whatever part of the country that you're in.  You don't even have to... Even if you want to stay within your own same town... you can find another place to live that has a lower cost of living.  And again, I've talked about this idea in the past, especially what you're attempting to do is balance out that cost of living with job opportunities, career opportunities, new business opportunities, etc.  So I won't go into this more in detail, but the point is don't.  Get stuck.  Three, if you take nothing else out of this, I have emphasized this idea from I think the second video of the 200 plus videos I've done.  The idea being get out of debt.  It's very, very simple.  You either have debt or you don't.  If you have debt now, get out of it.  I can promise you the life that you lead today will be far, far, far better when you have no debt.  When you're going through a very stressful, difficult situation, forget this pandemic.  you will have more, again, stressful, difficult, challenging situations.  I can tell you from my own experience, for a fact, and from the experience of many others, they're going to be a lot easier when you don't have any debt, when you don't have any bill collectors calling you, when you're not getting threats of having your electricity turned off.  Again, Get out of debt, whatever it takes, whatever you have to do, no matter how low you have to go, get out of debt, living like an immigrant.  I've talked about that in the past.  If that's what it takes, some short term pain for the long term gain of getting out of debt.  Do it.  I promise you, you will be a much better, stronger person on the other side of this when you're out of debt.  Let me finish by saying, none of us can control the past forever.  We can't discuss all the mistakes we made, etc.  We can only hopefully, A, learn from them, and most importantly, B, not repeat them.  But there are going to be more crises.  There will be more problems that will come across in your life similar to what we're dealing with today, unfortunately.  However... You can start preparing right now to deal with those things.  The bottom line is the things you start doing today, right now, your 60-year-old self, your 70-year-old self can thank you for.  I'm telling you for a fact.  As a 50-something man, I am thanking my 20-something stupid kid for the things that I did do right.  Because the things that I did do right when I was in my 20s, when I woke up, if you will.  They are paying off big time right now.  And as opposed to barely surviving, I'm thriving.  You can too.  Gentlemen, as always, hit the like button if you found this profitable.  John Galt out. ",
