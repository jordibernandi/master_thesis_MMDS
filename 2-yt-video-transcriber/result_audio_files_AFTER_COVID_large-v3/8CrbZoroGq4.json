            "text": "So you guys have enjoyed my recent videos on neo-Nazi subcultures.  If you look at my channel and the work of my channel you'll see I have made a lot of videos like this and I actually have a big list of videos that are very similar to this.  so we're going to do another one because that's what you guys seem to like at the moment.  But for today's video we're going to be looking at gay Nazis historically, gay Nazis in the alt-right today and what ideology drives these people because just like a lot of these topics I often cover.  There seems to be a very inherent contradiction in that, you know, being a gay Nazi.  Of course, we all know as part of German laws against homosexuality, many, many gay men were sent to concentration camps.  And of course, I don't need to tell most of you, most gay people are obviously not fascist for the reasons that they are pretty incompatible most people.  and it's not surprising due to societal oppression throughout the years including going on today that most gay people are more left-leaning.  but that's why we're going to really delve into gay fascist ideology and how they can reconcile this with themselves because it is very interesting reading about all this stuff.  But yeah, just to make it clear, I'm not in any way saying that there's something about being gay that makes you more susceptible to being a fascist or that most gay men are fascist because that is definitely not true.  It is a tiny, tiny minority.  But like I said, interesting to dissect this stuff.  So we're going to start this video by talking about the history and we're going to be talking about probably the most famous gay fascist in history.  And that is Ernst Ruhm.  I think I'm saying that right.  I've heard some German people say it this way.  It's spelled R-O-H-M.  I've seen some other spellings that say R-O-E-H-M.  But I'm going to say it as Ruhm for this video.  Please correct me if I'm wrong, German speakers.  But Haaretz ran a really good article based on a book just talking about him and his leadership with the brown shirts and how he reconciled being a gay man with also being a leading figure in the Nazi party.  So the article I'm going to read is adapted from a chapter in the book, The New Histories of Nazism.  I'm going to link this article in the description.  So it starts by saying the stormtroopers were in effect the military arm of the Nazi party.  It was an all-male, anti-Semitic, aggressive, radical organization Headed by Ernst Ruhm, an open homosexual, open that in the terms of the period he never made his sexual orientation public, but everybody knew about it.  In fact, of all the parties in Germany, it was the Social Democrats who attacked the Nazis in election campaigns over Ruhm's sexual preferences.  So as a gay person in a society that identified gay people as feminine, he consciously cultivated a contrary ideal of a manly homosexual.  Masculinity from his point of view was based, among other traits, on courage, honour, decency, discipline and fraternity.  Room was a decorated soldier in World War One, even earning a scar on his face.  From his point of view, the experience at the front removed the mask of society's hypocritical face.  That, he insisted, was also the proper way to look at life as a constant revolution, one that includes the liberation of sexual urges.  As he saw it, politics and society was based and deserved to be based on fraternity among men.  As Ruhm wrote in his 1928 memoir, the struggle against the cant, deceit and hypocrisy of today's society must begin with the most basic in life, that is the sexual urges.  If this struggle is successful, only then will it be possible to rip the mask off the illusion of all life's social and legal arrangements.  Room also worked to one degree or another for the advancement of gays even though he identified himself more than once as bisexual during police interrogations.  He was also a member for the Society for Human Rights, the largest organization of gay people during the Weimar period, not a self-evident membership because many gays at the time were apolitical or afraid to come out of the closet.  Ironically enough that beginning in 1931 the Social Democrats attacked him and the Nazis for corrupting the country's youth Because they appointed Rome to a top position.  And he was tried five times for violating paragraph 175.  Which categorizes being gay as a criminal act.  But he was acquitted each time.  Now him and Hitler were friends.  And Hitler did constantly defend Rome.  room about his sexuality and all his criticism.  He maintained that Room was actually not gay or he had been gay but had promised to stop engaging in sexual relations with men.  and also remember at this time it was a widely held belief that being gay was just a sexual perversion essentially.  Broome was eventually purged in the Night of the Long Knives on June 30th 1934.  He was arrested and shot the same day.  and then Nazi policy towards gay people became a lot more hardcore and led to what we see during things like the Holocaust where they are rounded up and put in concentration camps.  and this is largely because of people like Heinrich Himmler who who were notoriously homophobic and he led the SS.  So there was no leeway or no tolerance anymore.  Now that's a brief summary of Rome's role in the Nazi party, but we didn't really talk about his ideology.  And I think it's interesting because his ideology about gay fascists is something you still see today.  So maybe he is the modern father of gay fascism in that regard.  But Huffington Post wrote a good article about this.  So Rome often referred to the ancient Greek tradition of sending gay soldier couples into battle because they were believed to be the most ferocious fighters.  The famous pass of Thermopylae, for example, was held by 300 soldiers who consisted of 150 gay couples.  In the early years of the brown shirts, Hitler and Rome's underground army was seen as predominantly gay.  Rome assigned prominent posts to his lovers making Edmund Heinz his deputy and Karl Ernst the commander in Berlin.  So combine his view of these Greek gay soldiers like the Spartans and of course in antiquity a lot of people were gay and it was widely accepted and combine that with his experience in the trenches where he thinks.  you know this sort of revolution is based on male fraternity and And you can see how it is maybe sort of compatible with Nazi ideology in a way, in the sense that you have these gender roles and to be these good fighters, it's about having this brotherhood and maybe this brotherhood does extend to romantic relations.  but if you are masculine if you are violent if you're leading militant revolutions then those things aren't incompatible.  but it's of course ironic that while he was members of these groups pushing for gay rights he helped this nazi party gain power and conduct a massive massive purge of German gay people and of course the Nazi ideology by the time they properly seized power was outwardly homophobic and under Himmler and people like him and many people who were very homophobic at the time there was a massive crackdown on gay people.  And a small caveat is that the Nazis had stricter policies on gay men compared to lesbian women but I'm not going to downplay that.  both suffered awful persecution.  But staying on the historical angle, Rome wasn't the last gay fascist and outwardly gay fascist.  So a HuffPost article from 2008 seems like a bit ahead of its time in terms of talking about this stuff.  But it goes through various European politicians and various Western political figures who were gay fascists as well.  So the article by... Johan Harry says, just look at our own continent.  over the past decade.  Dutch fascist Pim Forten ran on a blatantly racist anti-immigrant platform describing Islam as a cancer and the biggest threat to Western civilization today.  And this article was written by a gay man, by the way.  Yet with two little fluffy dogs and a mama complex, he was openly flamboyantly gay.  When he accused a political opponent of hating Arabs, he replied, how can I hate Arabs?  I sucked one off last night.  And who does that sound like in contemporary politics?  It sounds like Milo Yiannopoulos, who we will get to a bit later in this video.  So there are allegations that George Hader was gay, who was an Austrian neo-Nazi.  And in 2000, his Freedom Party won a quarter of the vote and joined the country's government as a coalition partner.  He had a hatred of immigrants.  He was anti-Semitic.  He described Auschwitz as a punishment center before a German paper broke the story that he was allegedly gay.  There were rumors of an Indian waiter with intimate details of Haider's body.  Gerald Misca quickly quit amid accusations that he was Haider's lover.  Haider, who was married and had two children, kept quiet while his functionaries denied the rumors.  The revelation that he died after leaving a gay bar suggests these rumors might have been true.  France's leading post-war fascist was Edouard Pfeiffer, who was gay.  germany's leading neo-nazi all through the 80s was called michael kuhnen.  he died of aids in 1991 a few years after coming out as gay.  so then we go to britain in the 90s.  so martin webster a formal national front organizer and head honcho of the british fascist movement wrote a four-page pamphlet detailing his affair with nick griffin in the late 1970s and also in britain the leader of the skinhead movement through the 70s was someone called nicky crane who was an icon of a reactionary backlash against immigrants and feminism.  He came out as gay in the 1980s before he died of AIDS as well.  And reading that history was just to show how there have been more prominent gay fascist figures throughout Europe during this time.  So we spoke about the ideology of gay fascists but now we're going to talk about how this relates to contemporary members of the alt-right.  A big one these days is Islam and migration from Islamic countries.  And it's a big rallying cry in the sense that they say Islamic countries are so homophobic.  You know, if you go there as a gay person and get charged, there's a likelihood you'll be in prison for years and some you'll be executed for it.  So why do we want people like that here?  Now, Milo Yiannopoulos is a prominent troll, gay man and one of the more prominent figures of the alt-right.  So here he is back in Washington.  I think 2016, being interviewed by Dave Rubin.  And here is what he has to say about Islamic refugees and Islamic migrants coming to Europe. ",

            "text": "This is sort of what liberalism has welcomed into Europe.  You know, this is the excuse making that's been made for radical Islam, which has prevented us from fighting this problem by people who lie about the... source of these people, the news stations who refuse to accept that these attacks have anything to do with Islam, the people who won't even use the word Muslim before it happens.  This is preventing us from fixing the problem.  This is preventing people from taking adequate security precautions, looking after themselves.  Europe now welcoming in millions of people from alien cultures whilst the establishment refuses to accept that these people's belief systems are just dramatically incompatible with our own.  And the regular citizenry is being lied to and lied about constantly, all the time by the media on this stuff.  And as a gay man, I'm terrified by the prospect of mass Muslim immigration into Europe.  It's one of the reasons I spend so much time in America now.  I don't want to be there anymore.  It is not extremists.  It's not radical Islamists.  It's not the people the security services are worried about.  that are the problem.  It is the silent majority of Muslims who do nothing in this situation, have no peace movement, no resistance to their own extreme elements, just like the progressive left in the West.

            "text": "So what he says is pretty common in the sense that Muslims who come to Europe allegedly are not compatible.  But the wrinkle, of course, is that he is talking about this from the perspective of being a gay man in Europe.  So this is a thing they're trying with the alt-right, and they have been trying, to get more gay people into the movement and to get more gay people to hate Muslims.  And the big rallying cry at the moment for the alt-right is white genocide, primarily driven from the refugee crisis caused by the civil wars in the region, caused by Western interference in the region, creating loads of refugees fleeing to Europe in one of the worst refugee crises of the last decades.  Which has led to this conspiracy theory that white people are being replaced and people like Marlonopoulos and the alt-right criticize politicians for trying to make the distinction between Muslim people and Islamic extremists.  And the alt-right are trying to paint themselves as the only people who are willing to stand up for Western civilization which apparently now to fascists also includes gay rights.  now a further interesting wrinkle into this is that it only includes gay rights because these gay fascists don't like transgender people and they don't like lesbians they don't like feminism.  they're still all about being super masculine.  so let's get into the ideology and some other prominent figures of gay people in the alt-right right.  so a good slate article written by donna minkowitz back in 2017 titled how the alt-right is using sex and camp to attract gay men to fascism is very interesting in talking about jack donovan a gay member of the alt-right.  so the article starts.  at the national policy institute's 2015 conference alt-right star richard spencer's annual nazi fest a speaker named jack donovan exhorted the crowd to leave the world the way you entered it kicking and screaming and covered in someone else's blood.  another alt writer james j o'meara.  in his book the homo and the negro o'meara says that gay white men represent the best of what western culture has to offer because of their intelligence and beauty and that negroes represent the worst Being incapable of his achievement.  Aside from these two both being open fascists.  They are also out gay men.  Now a big thing that gay people within the alt-right today focus on is gay culture.  They believe gay culture is synonymous with leftism.  And it's trying to emasculate men.  You know the stereotypical gay nightclub culture as they see it.  So Donovan also touches on this like many of them do.  And in a 2010 essay as part of a long list of evils that he feels been perpetrated by gay culture.  He says the extreme promiscuity, the sadomachism, the transvestitism, the transsexuality and flamboyant effeminacy promoted by the pink haired punk rock stepped children of feminism gay activists.  And the article also outlines how that neither O'Meara nor Donovan actually support gay rights because they don't believe in civil rights.  So O'Meara wants to be part of an imagined elite band of men who love each other and rule society.  His version of an Aryan fantasy called the Manabund.  He doesn't want to support, as he puts it in the interview with Alternative Rights, some snivelling queen demanding my rights.  The plight of the homosexuals is a leftist myth.  Donovan says explicitly that straight people should be given more power and privileges than gay folks because their reproductive sexuality is superior to ours.  Both men openly detest lesbians and trans people.  Donovan calling the trans movement men who want to cut their dicks off and women who want to cut their tits off.  Lovely.  And of course, no white nationalist organization anywhere supports LGBT rights on a social or legislative level.  Their new support is limited to allowing cis gay men who are white racists to join them.  So the through line you're beginning to see here is that these white men who are gay and are also fascists Don't see the two as at odds with each other as long as being gay doesn't make you, in their opinion, you know, some effeminate leftist with pink hair or something like that.  Now, you guys saw me read this in the brony video, but here is an extract of Buttercup Dew, who is a gay brony neo-Nazi.  That's a mouthful.  saying why they don't like gay culture much in line with these members of the alt-right.  But then, this is interesting, it was around this time I was coming to terms with being a flaming homo, so I frequented the gay bars around the place.  I saw a lot of working-class masculine white men in their 30s and 40s standing around with their thumbs up their arses while the DJ blared out the song Tragedy.  The contradiction between the male reality and the third gender leftist fantasy about homosexual men was made very apparent to me at the time.  So I never really bought the gay identity that the left was selling.  So to conclude the video, of course, no one believes that most gay men are fascists or are neo-Nazis.  But what I wanted to highlight with this video is the specific ideology that white gay men who are fascists believe in to make them feel like it's okay to be part of these groups.  Because on the surface, you're thinking, why would you do this?  You're just going to turn out like Ernst R\u00f6hm.  One day, if the Nazis, you know, the new Nazis ever took power anywhere, they would have used you and then they'll discard you.  Just like I was saying with the other things like the, you know, the furries and bronies where Nazis wouldn't actually accept that.  But while they're in the minority, while they're in opposition.  while they're looking for as much recruits as possible.  They will use you and pretend they are okay with it.  Now perhaps what we are seeing is a stretch to normalize this stuff within the alt-right itself by taking the ideology of people like Rome saying, you know, look back to ancient Greece and the warrior gay people of Sparta and, you know, others taking inspiration from him being a militant fascist himself who rose to prominence.  And then you have people like O'Meara and Donovan who are saying they hate queer culture and they're trying to make being gay and fascist something where you are just super, super masculine and you can be compatible with fascist ideology that has this very specific gender roles for people where the men are, you know, the soldiers, the fighters and women are essentially just there to raise a family.  But it's definitely an interesting contradiction.  And of course, I feel bad for gay people who join the alt-right in a weird way because like I said at the end of the day I don't think fascist movements are ever going to accept you properly.  While we do see quite an apparent history throughout the last 100 years of these visible gay figures in fascist movements it doesn't seem to end well for any of them when they're outed and you know the public hear about them or when they're just purged because elements within the movement don't like gay people a lot more than other members.  and despite how visible these figures are I'm hoping Obviously, I don't have any data.  I'm hoping it's still a very, very small minority.  But let me know what you guys think in the comments.  If you want to support my work, please like and share the video.
