He was the one promoting things like anti-vaxxer conspiracies or global warming conspiracies or other things like birtherism.  That was enough to turn me off Trump.  Then there was the scammy university.  That was enough too.  Then there were all his failed businesses.  That was enough too.  And now he's boasting that he's capable of remembering five words in a dementia test.  You know, because that was one of the difficult questions.  And there are still people out there who think that he's the stable genius responsible for the great economy.  When in reality, there were no changes in the unemployment rate decrease or the GDP increase when Trump took over from Obama.  And he still has a 40% approval rating.  That's not 40% who think he's better than Hillary or something, or 40% think that he's doing a good job triggering the libs.  That's 40% who think that he's actually doing a good job.  So this is my genuine question to those 40% that think that he's doing a good job.  Why?  And, you know, what would he actually have to do to make you think that he's doing a bad job? ",
