            "text": "The land of Arcadia.  Hello there, my friends.  Chris Marcus here with you for Arcadia Economics.  And tonight, an exciting video because there was a big change in the silver world today where we've been waiting to see how things shake out with the July silver deliveries right on the heels of record gold deliveries.  And the first day of data did not disappoint.  Because according to the reports issued, it looks like JP Morgan is posting 30 million ounces of silver on day one of the July delivery cycle.  And let us dig in.  First of all, I'd like to give a lot of credit here to Craig Hemke, who was all over this in his podcast today.  And actually Ronan Manley, who was kind enough to send me this, emailed it to me.  Although he also posted on Twitter, yesterday was first intent date for July, 5,000 ounce contract.  A huge 11,458 contracts stepped up to the plate for delivery.  of which it turns out that here you see JP Morgan issued or is set to deliver 5,975 contracts, which at 5,000 ounces per contract is just under 30 million ounces.  And Craig put this into great perspective in his podcast today.  I'm going to play a small snippet of that, but Keep in mind, JP Morgan had zero in their warehouse when the price of silver crashed from $49 in April of 2011.  They rushed to open those vaults and started accumulating ever since then.  Ted Butler thinks that JP Morgan has as many as a billion ounces.  What we could see, well, we couldn't actually see the silver, but we could see, and you'll see it here, There is JP Morgan.  This is the CME Group report.  And you see their total at 160 million ounces, which it's been in that range for quite a while now.  I'd say a couple of years, you know, 150, 160.  So the change today is that apparently, and we'll go back.  here.  So you see, here's the 11,458 contracts that Ronan cited, basically 6,000 JP Morgan issuer delivering, and here's JP Morgan's customer account.  So now again, if you want to tell me that these numbers aren't accurate or that the data's outright fraudulent anywhere in between there, I would certainly accept as a possibility.  My one thought on that is that either they're saying they're gonna deliver the 6,000 contracts, or if the numbers aren't, I mean, that would be stunning, or if someone's lying about the numbers, then you would think that would also be stunning for whatever reason, although probably bullish for silver if you're committing fraud with these numbers.  But we'll take it on face value and see that you know, the 6,000 contracts there.  What is interesting here, and again, this chart was courtesy of Craig.  He highlights how, see, negative 29, almost 30 million ounces go from eligible to registered.  You see it switched here.  In fact, we're going to cover this article here.  You see the chart before that update came out.  There you see it was 160 and 151 in the eligible category.  and that has been updated.  there you see 30 million ounces now.  i wanted to get things as accurate as possible so i made some phone calls today and feel kind of grateful of the people in the silver world that i'm able to speak with.  talked with david morgan.  he said well i'll believe it when i see it when the metal actually leaves the warehouse.  he did agree that it is scheduled here but whether it actually leaves although when i asked him do you think it's at least moved from one side of the imaginary line to the other?  he said that's possible.  um so by all means if you want to speculate whether they're going to somehow fleece people out of the metal or avoid the delivery, it sure looks like it is scheduled there.  And I'll play a brief clip so you can hear in Craig's own words what he felt about that because I thought that was well phrased. ",

            "text": "So again, I'm kind of learning this whole delivery and translating these CME reports on the fly here.  And I really want to get the language correct.  I don't think the metal has left the building yet, but it seems like they've committed to that.  and have updated their warehouse report.  So a few other items here, which fortunately are actually summarized.  Craig was really on fire today, I must say.  And I know when I bring him on the show, I say he's one of my favorites.  And this is the reason why you're seeing here.  He had an article for Sprott Money, basically comparing, not comparing, but going through the gold and silver deliveries.  And let's see here, starting with the COMEX Gold.  Over the past several years, as far back as I have records, an average delivery month for COMEX Gold sees anywhere from 6,000 to 10,000 deliveries.  um between 2015 and 19. the highest amount was 15 almost 16 000. and note that april of 2019 saw 7 000 june just 2500. and again this is coming off of this april we saw six thirty one thousand as compared to 7,000 in April.  And then June last year was 2,500.  And this year it was 55,000.  And again, it's not like this is just, I mean, if this was 1942 or something or in the middle of some time where nothing's happening, but as for anyone who's been watching my show here for any period of time, we've been detailing one piece of evidence after another that You know, still, when is the official break point?  When do you wake up and your price is silver?  You can sell your silver for 75 bucks or something like that.  Okay. ",
