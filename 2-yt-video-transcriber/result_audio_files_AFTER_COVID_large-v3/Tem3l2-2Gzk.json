The former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang says he knows what Congress can do to avoid another Great Depression.  The Emergency Money for the People Act.  It would give $2,000 a month to adults making less than $130,000 a year, 4,000 to married couples making less than $260,000, an additional $500 per child up to three children.  Andrew Yang ran for president as a Democrat.  He also wanted the universal basic income.  Andrew's with me now.  Your plan is expensive.  Even those who are in favor of it admit it will be expensive to implement.  Just how expensive? ",

            "text": "Richard, we've already spent $3 trillion on stimulus packages.  The problem is that most of that money did not go to American families.  And so you're seeing right now the employment rate in the United States, despite the recent uptick is below 55%.  It was 61% pre-crisis.  So that's over 10 million Americans who've gotten booted out of the labor force.  And many of them are going to become increasingly desperate.  America clearly has the resources to be able to make families whole and give people a secure path forward right now.  We're just putting that money in the hands of the big companies and the banks and not our families.  So that's what we need to change.  And if we do that, we have a chance to still avert a Great Depression because we can see that this crisis is going to keep on rolling on and on in the United States for months. ",

Only two groups work at lower rates, new moms who spend more time with their children and teenagers who spend more time in school.  So these are the results that we've seen.  in the US, in other countries.  And this is particularly vital during a pandemic because right now you have Americans who are unfortunately reopening bars and going back to work in part because they don't have a choice.  We have to give Americans a chance to actually pursue the right actions according to our public health experts instead of feeling like they have to go out to be able to put food on the table. ",

The fact is putting money into people's hands will be good for businesses, be good for job growth, be good for maintaining the economy throughout this crisis.  So we have to think bigger about, like you just said, common sense solutions.  74% of Americans are for direct cash relief during this time, including a majority of Republicans.  So this isn't about socialism versus capitalism.  This is about common sense ways that we can keep our economy strong and preserve millions of jobs through a multi-month shutdown. ",

And so to me, it's not an either or in the sense that there are many incredibly qualified women who I know are being considered for his beat pick.  And this is a very personal choice that Joe understands well, because he knows you need to have the right chemistry with a partner in governance.  And so it's in Joe's hands who he's going to pick, and I'm sure he'll make a great decision. ",
