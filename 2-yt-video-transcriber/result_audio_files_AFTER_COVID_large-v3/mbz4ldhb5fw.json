            "text": "Hi there, Peter of England bringing you a massive announcement concerning debt easement eradication program that Weirbank was looking to launch in 2019.  But it's taken over a year to make the preparations.  It's taken just over a year to get everything lined up ready for you.  Now, I can imagine at this moment I'm talking to a lot of pissed off people out there.  This video is initially addressed mainly to people in the United States and the United Kingdom because this is where the voucher payoff system is going to initially be rolled out.  The vouchers are called economic impact vouchers and they're available to you as of now but limited to five.  The first thing you've got to do is go to freemanlegalservices.com website and search at the top for the button which says QE Voucher.  QE stands for Quantitative Easing.  and quantitative easing is the people's quantitative easing this time.  Instead of allowing the Federal Reserve to put one billion every day into the pockets of the corporatocracy, what's going to happen now is a combination of the United States Treasury, the United States Department of Defense, and the United Kingdom Treasury are going to start putting that money into your pocket.  Stimulus, these amounts of money, have mysteriously been manifested out of thin air almost under these what's called coronavirus stimulus bills, which became Axe, in 2020.  So these are the main provisions.  In the United States, there's between, well, not between, there's one tranche of two trillion, one tranche of to give a total of six trillion United States dollars available to stimulate the United States economy.  And the economy is you.  In the United Kingdom, the amount is a paltry 40 billion, but that's another story.  So you, in effect, are the economy.  You are the people that need stimulating.  And if any of you have suffered any degree, of financial inconvenience if you have suffered at all economically or financially if you have suffered at all emotionally or for any other reason then you have a claim under this legislation for the people in the united states.  um it's the general conduct of the Act.  Initially, $1,200 checks are being sent to every household.  In the United Kingdom, the main thing that you need to be looking there is what's called financial provision, and that is Section 86 of the Coronavirus Act 2020.  So we have open-ended facility now to make payment.  So when people look at the scenario, look at the fact that the economies of the world have now been decimated, to ask the question, who pays for the shutdown?  Who's paying for this lockdown?  Well, it's old John Bull and it's Uncle Sam.  So the President of the United States Donald J. Trump.  The United States Department of Defense, from what's called its non-adjusted accounts, which has around about 21 trillion in there, have taken the initiative to step in now and allow us collectively to do what we haven't been able to do for a long time, as long as the Kazarian Zionist global banking mafia had control of the Federal Reserve and the main amounts of money supply on the planet.  You will be very, very interested to know that the Federal Reserve now is firmly in the hands and firmly in the control of the commander-in-chief, which is Donald Trump, and the United States military, which performed a soft coup in 2016, but in effect, since the 14th of September 2001, three days after 9-11 happened, under what's called the Emergency War Powers Act 1941, in effect, the United States military have taken control and are the paymasters general for all debts within the United States.  Now, for some of you in the United Kingdom who might say, well, what's that got to do with us?  There is partial provision, we believe, for the United States to be able to pay debts for you also in the United Kingdom.  We're initially running this initiative for those people in the United States which will be initially vets, veterans of the military, also serving military personnel and state nationals, and then it's also going to be rolled out to the general citizenry by the end of May.  All you have to do is decide who you want to pay and find out how much you need to pay.  What can you pay?  You can pay off virtually anything.  You can pay your rent in advance to your landlord.  You can pay state and federal taxes.  You can pay fines.  You can pay court fines.  You can pay off mortgages.  You can pay off car loans, capital machinery.  farm machinery, virtually anything you want.  Utility bills in advance.  All these things are doable.  And the payor is the United States Treasury and the UK Treasury.  And the payee is obviously the individual that needs paying, the so-called creditor that wants money from you.  So these people, the payee, the ones you want to pay, are being paid by the United States and HMRC treasuries, not by Weir Bank and not by your bank.  So please clarify that now in your mind.  So what you've also got to ask yourself is, why is the one narrative being perpetrated across the entire planet?  all the media is in what's called lockstep narrative every country everywhere saying the same thing the politicians saying the same thing big pharma saying the same thing.  the church and the church leaders.  no one has come out and said that there is an alternative to what's been proposed to you and what has caused this entire lockdown scenario.  So I'll reveal to you now why it's happened and why it's been done.  If Hillary Rodham Clinton had won the 2016 United States presidential election, you would never have heard of COVID-19.  But she lost, and now you've heard of it.  Because what the New World Order, losing its grip now, wants to do is to retake the United States presidency at any cost whatsoever.  Do you understand that?  Any cost whatsoever.  And that cost is you.  It's whether you're in India, whether you're in Jakarta, Indonesia, Oceania, Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, France, the Middle East, UAE, it doesn't matter where you are, that's the cost of executing this plan.  To reiterate, finally, in conclusion, go to freemanlegalservices.com website, look up QE voucher at the top of the page.  That explains everything.  Find out then who you want to pay and how much you wish to pay, and then follow the links and the instructions, and that will show you everything.  So for those of you who are aware of QE, in the United States.  Those of you who are aware of Q globally, welcome.  Q has been working very, very hard in the background.  Q stands for many things.  QE stands for quantitative easing.  In effect, the economic impact voucher is a Q claim against the powers that have inconvenienced you and criminally tried to tyrannize you and harm you and lock you into a mindset that would have you rendered into a automaton robotic 1984 Orwellian agenda.  So if you like what you've heard, subscribe, pass the video on to other people, communicate it as far and wide as you can.  I also post now on Vimeo, so you'll be able to find this video on there should anything happen to it.  And I'm also going to be doing a webinar within the next week or two to explain a little bit more about what I've covered in this video and also to explain to you what I think is the next phase, phase two of the coronavirus pandemic.  scandaldemic, which probably will be rolled out in September, October, as it starts to get colder and just in time to derail the 2020 November United States presidential elections.  OK, thank you. ",
