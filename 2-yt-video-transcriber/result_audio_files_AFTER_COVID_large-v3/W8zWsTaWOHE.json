            "text": "Now, you're going to really see the war ignite before your eyes when the National Football League kicks off.  70% of the players in the National Football League are African-American.  And there are tremendous pressures on those players because there's a militant sector run by Sherman.  He plays San Francisco.  Kaepernick, if he gets back in the league, and he probably will.  Seattle will probably sign him.  there are pressure on the other African-American players who may not be militant or radical to kneel.  All right?  And in the locker rooms, there's going to be strife because not all the players want to see their country insulted.  They don't believe, not all the players believe this is a racist nation, but many, many do.  So what you're going to have is you're going to have, if they do play the Star-Spangled Banner, and I don't think they will.  I think if they play, it'll be 20, 25 minutes before game time.  But the commissioner of the National Football League, Roger Goodell, let's see him, he makes $40 million a year.  He's been in the job 14 years.  All he has to do is say, we're not going to have any politics on game day.  There are no politics, no political expression, nothing on your uniform, no kneeling, no waving your arms, no anything.  We'll have the anthem before the game.  You don't have to come out for it.  You can stay in the locker room.  We're not having politics on game day.  On Wednesday, we'll have an open press session, and you can say whatever you want about anything you want.  But not on Sunday, Thursday night, before the game, Monday night, whatever it may be.  Now, he could easily do that, Goodell.  And if you violate that, you're suspended for two games.  You violate it again, you're suspended for five games.  Now, most of the owners, and the owners are all white, again, they have the money, are conservatives.  They don't want this.  And most of the fans that go to the games are traditional Americans.  They may not be conservatives, but they're traditional.  If you have a circus, a political circus, before these NFL games, you know the press is going to be all over it.  That's going to blow up.  And that will be the Gettysburg of the Second American Civil War that we're experiencing now.  Again, I advise Mr.  Goodell to make that rule and to make it fast.  You'll take some heat, Roger, but you'll save your league.  And you'll save the teams because, as I said, there's going to be trouble in those locker rooms. ",
