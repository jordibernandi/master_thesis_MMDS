            "text": "Pay attention!  We're losing our democracy!  Wake up!  There's a lot more where that meltdown came from, and you guys are going to love today's episode.  I'm Tyler Zedd.  Welcome to Zeducation.  welcome to zeducation and welcome to another sjw episode on this series.  we have been talking about and highlighting the absurdity and the hysteria fueled in this country by social justice movements.  a lot of these movements they're trying to fight battles that have already been won.  take for example equal pay for equal work.  we all agree every single person agrees that if you do the same work you should get the same pay no matter what you look like no matter what gender you are.  And luckily for us, that has been passed into law already.  Back in 1963, when John F. Kennedy passed the Equal Pay Act of 1963.  So people who go out on the streets and they scream and they talk about the gender pay gap, what exactly do they want to be done?  Because if you are getting paid unequally, you have a lawsuit on your hands.  And I guarantee you, you can find somebody to take it pro bono.  Guaranteed.  All of this is fueled by the media, and they have drummed up this hysteria.  And they have given these people a sense of purpose.  They feel like they're fighting for something, and as I said, battles that have already been won.  And before we get into some of the meltdowns today, I want to go over this meme right here, which perfectly explains the difference between a social activist and a social justice warrior.  Okay, here's the difference between social activists and social justice warriors.  Social activist.  Oh look, there's no wheelchair ramps into that building.  Let's build a ramp.  social justice Warrior let's persecute the people using the stairs and make them feel bad for having legs and that's why we need to continue calling out social justice Warriors and highlight the insanity and the absurdity on places like this channel.  so today we're going to go over some more of these crazy crazy examples of social justice Warriors and activism gone wrong.  but before we do so as always please subscribe to this channel and please click the bell for notifications when new videos are uploaded now onto some of these social justice Warriors.  As we have all seen in the past four years, one of the biggest, biggest talking points of the social justice movement is getting rid of Trump because he is the evil.  He is the racist bad guy.  And when all of this hysteria, that narrative gets pushed by the media and these talking heads, people start acting crazy.  They start acting like this.  It was so stupid.  It was so stupid.  Word of advice, barking like a dog doesn't get anyone to side with you.  It makes you look crazy and it actually pushes people away from what you're trying to talk about.  So, I mean, it's good for us.  Just keep doing whatever.  Honestly, just keep doing it.  It's entertaining at the very least.  Can we normalize men in muzzles?  Because all they want to do is... But... Honey, the biggest turn on you can do for a woman, or anyone, is shut that pipe.  There's a few muzzle jokes in this, but I'm just going to leave it at that.  Guys, next time you are out eating dinner, make sure you keep an eye on the racist things around you, okay?  Because if you see anything racist, you can report it now to Yelp. ",

You're going to try and ruin somebody's business.  And as we know, places like NBC, ABC, CNN, MSNBC, they all reported on that and they all cried hate crime.  So you're going to ruin someone's life off of a possible fake story.  Any of you that have a restaurant, I feel bad for you because all it takes is someone to come in, cry racism, it's going to be believed, and then you're probably going to lose your business. ",

FML, I am not okay right now. ",

            "text": "Just so we're clear, critical race theory is not diversity training.  Critical race theory says that the entire system is racist.  It's built by white men and it's racist.  And it blames many problems on the system.  It doesn't put any accountability on an individual.  And for me, that's a problem.  I believe in anyone's individual rights.  Because you know what?  If you really, really want to, you can change things for the better in this country, no matter what you look like.  And there are many, many examples of that.  For instance, the black president that we had and his black attorney general, two of the most powerful people in the country.  That's how amazing this country is.  No matter what you look like, you can rise to the top, to that level of power.  And everyone has that ability as an individual.  So I don't feel bad at all because critical race theory, it does not empower individuals, not one bit.  It actually devalues their ability to help themselves.  We're raising our daughter gender neutral, but she only wants pink dresses.  Where did we mess up?  Where did we mess up?  I thought the whole movement was supposed to be about accepting.  Accepting everyone.  Why can't you just accept your daughter?  Because she likes pink dresses.  Give me one dollar or I'm voting for Trump.  That's called the hustle right there.  If he's in San Francisco or New York City, I guarantee he made tons of money.  Free slabs for cisgendered, straight-identified white men.  So tolerant.  So tolerant.  Oh, you love to see it.  They're doing so much for the movement.  They're doing so much.  A bike company offers black customers reparations in the form of a discount.  Again, I have a hard time believing that this is truly helping anybody.  Like, what is it changing?  What is it doing?  Letting them have $10?  Before and after college.  What lies ahead?  A poem.  Hi, I'm a slut.  A slam poem.  Oh, man.  Sometimes, college can be the most toxic thing you can let your kid do.  This is a very sad and tragic example of that.  Honestly.  But hey, on the right, so empowered.  So empowered, you guys.  She's gonna live such a happy life now.  Communism, bro.  Communism.  Yeah, dude.  On an iPhone.  Posting on Reddit about freaking capitalism, man, dude.  Don't let your kid be this kid.  This is a tragedy.  Under his eye, blessed be the fruit.  This is actually a real story.  Like, they were comparing Amy Coney Barrett's dress with The Handmaid's Tale.  Oh, how dare she?  She's wearing red.  It's the same dress as The Handmaid's Tale.  So you can't wear red anymore?  Like, these people are delusional.  Swedish Left Party chapter wants to make urinating while standing illegal for men.  Sometimes I feel like there are people within these leftist groups... That are plants.  They're trying to make themselves look very, very stupid and insane to drive people away from the left.  And if that's the case, it's genius.  But if not, like, how blind can you be?  How blind can you be to try and get people to do stupid things like this?  It's just not going to work.  Also, great reporting, Huffington Post.  You guys never cease to amaze.  Donald Trump, the reason why the country has the highest unemployment.  Don't vote for him.  Ad me snap.  Oh, yes.  Taking advantage of the hate to promote the Snapchat account.  I love it.  NBA caves to fans.  Boss says next season will abandon social justice messaging and return to normalcy.  Look at that.  We have some hope, guys.  We have some hope.  People walked away in such grand fashion.  I want to say that the ratings for the NBA championship with LeBron in it were down like 70%.  And now they have to go back to not having the social justice messages everywhere, which is a good thing.  There's hope, guys.  There's hope.  I should President Trump come see your show.  Well, I hope he doesn't because I won't perform if he does.  Really?  Really.  Tell me why. ",
