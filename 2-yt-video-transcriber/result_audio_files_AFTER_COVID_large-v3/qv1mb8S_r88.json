            "text": "And this is London, but broadcasting to you, of course, all over the world.  Thanks to the wonders of the internet.  Thanks to Sputniknews.com.  We're also on FM in the Washington, D.C.  area.  105.5 are the magic numbers there.  And on AM across the United States from coast to coast.  But uniquely, I think this is a radio show with pictures.  And many of you, maybe even most of you, are watching the show as well as listening to it.  If you're watching on Facebook, either my Facebook or RT UK News Facebook or RT.com Facebook, The magic words are share, share, share, because we just don't have to beat the opposition here.  Not that there is much opposition.  Certainly on a Sunday, this is the only place you'll get proper politics discussed, proper cultural and other vibrant issues discussed.  But we have to beat the algorithms if you get my drift.  So the only way to do that is for you to take matters in your own hand and share, share and share on Facebook.  You can also watch on YouTube, on my own YouTube channel.  on RT's YouTube channel.  You can also watch on my Twitter.  And tonight, for the first time, you can watch live on Instagram.  Thank you very much, those who are doing so this way.  So a plethora of platforms in which you can be a part of the Open University of the Airwaves.  Now, Love Island became Death Island with the news that the erstwhile presenter of the show, Caroline Flack, at the age of just 40, took her own life.  And may she rest in peace.  She clearly was a woman who got caught up in something very sinister, very damaging indeed.  And I'm going to deal with this story from both sides because there's a danger of the British in a fit of moral hysteria attempting to address the issues raised by this young woman's death in entirely the wrong way, in ways which will make every matter worse.  Some of you won't like my take on these events, but it's my duty to tell you the truth.  as I see it.  Love Island is an excrescence.  I have never watched it, of course.  But it is a narcissistic jamboree, exploitative in the extreme, of young people at the most vulnerable parts of their lives.  And it's done for profit for ITV.  And it's done for the profit of the revolting tabloids that we have here in Britain, who suck at the teat.  until it bleeds and bleed it has.  Two of the participants of Love Island have committed suicide and now the presenter who was paid \u00a32 million a year to present.  Love Island has taken her own life at the apex of her fame and presumably wealth.  Everyone gets a piece of the action, but some people get more of a piece than others.  The tabloids fill their pages on a daily basis with the latest trials and tribulations of young teenagers, young people, young vulnerable people, making a fool of themselves, betraying each other, betraying their partners outside, preening and cursing Cock walking down the beaches of wherever it is filmed.  The whole thing is based on muscular, beautiful young people who of course do their best to live up to that ideal.  But it doesn't always work out like that.  They're not always the people that they are pretending to be on screen.  That's what happens in reality TV.  I spent 22 days inside the big house of Big Brother.  I know what it does to your mind.  And so it came as no surprise to me when serious problems began to present themselves with people who'd been released from the island and on whom the cameras were no longer trained and who had to face the music of the things they had done and said on that television program.  The tabloids love it.  It's a staple of the tabloid.  The only reason I know about Love Island or have ever heard of Caroline Flack was because when I was on a local radio station here in Britain, owned by Rupert Murdoch, who owns the biggest of the tabloids, of course, They would speak about nothing else in the show before I came on air.  And the man who had to hand over to me was the associate editor of The Sun, the worst of Mr Murdoch's British tabloid newspapers.  Dan Wooten was his name.  He's crying today in his Chardonnay about the demise of Caroline Flack.  But he was writing horrific stories and expos\u00e9s about her before she committed suicide.  He's crying now.  She's not crying because she's dead, Dan.  Now, all of that... may seem to you to be a prelude to me demanding new laws, state action, and so on.  But it's not.  Because I'm here to tell you the only thing worse than the rabid Mass media, the rabid so-called mainstream media that we have in this country, the only thing worse than that is a state-controlled media where there are laws to protect rich and famous people from exposure.  And there's people now, right now, gathering signatures.  I heard one in the car on the way here.  92,000 people have signed a petition demanding social media safeguards for celebrities.  Now just pause and think about that for one minute.  Many of these celebrities are only celebrities because of social media.  Many of these celebrities are consciously, proactively exploiting social media to put their price up, to sell tickets, to sell records, films, books.  If you have a law which says social media celebrities must be safeguarded, what you are really saying is that they must be treated differently to ordinary non-celebrities and protected and safeguarded from criticism.  And you're saying to them, you've got a license to print money.  We'll stop anyone.  criticizing you, attacking you, ridiculing you.  All you need to do is show up on the social media and sell your tickets.  That would clearly be a monstrosity.  I also see people damning the Crown Prosecution Service for bringing criminal charges against the late and lamented Caroline Flack for having allegedly attacked her partner in his sleep so severely that there was blood on every wall, blood everywhere.  And the partner called the police 999.  What were the police to do?  Say we're not going to come because she's a troubled celebrity?  What was the CPS supposed to do?  Not bring charges because she was a celebrity.  And what was the media to do?  Not report the fact that a two million a year television personality had allegedly banjoed her partner at the very risk of his life and that the police had been called, that the man had been taken to hospital.  Do you really want to repress?  that kind of news, you can't do so.  Because if you do so, you're saying to the rich and powerful, the celebrities, those that rule us, that there can be one law for them and a different law for a man who commits an assault up an alley.  in Middlesbrough or somewhere else, a man who is not a celebrity or a woman who is not a celebrity for that matter.  This is the road to madness.  Once upon a time in Parliament, I talked out a private member's bill by a Tory MP called Nigel Watterson, who wanted to introduce a privacy law.  And I was able to say, look, I could show you my scars.  I have actually had worse treatment from the mass media, on social media, than the vast majority of celebrities.  But I'm here to say, I told the Parliament, that this would be paving the road to hell with good intentions.  Because once rich and powerful people can do what they like, shielded by laws which have built walls to allow them to carry on to their heart's desire, then you would be in a totalitarian society and a totalitarian society bent to the wishes and the interests of the rich and powerful.  Prince Andrew, for example, his conduct, under a privacy law, under the protection of celebrities law, or whatever the petitioners want to call it, you would know nothing about the kind of things that the Queen's son has been doing with his well upholstered life paid for by us, the taxpayer.  If it wasn't for the Daily Mail, you wouldn't know any of these things.  You wouldn't know about Ghislaine Maxwell.  You wouldn't know about Prince Andrew and his relationship to Jeffrey Epstein.  And now another sex beast whose island, whose private island he's been visiting.  What was it about this sex beast's private island that first attracted you, Prince Andrew?  What I'm saying is... Yes, our tabloid media.  Yes, our mass media is oftentimes utterly revolting.  But you try being in a state-controlled media environment.  Because I've been there.  I've seen that.  I tell you, it marks death for democracy, for freedom of speech, for freedom of expression.  for freedom from the algorithms and freedom from the people that own the platforms, the so-called public square.  that turns out to be anything but public, I promise you, that would be good night.  Do not go quietly into that good night.  Now, if there's blood on the beach on Love Island, there's blood on the walls in the Democratic Party in the United States.  The latest wheeze, given the utter failure of the waxwork Joe Biden, given the utter failure of the fake Cherokee Elizabeth Warren, given the utter failure of Pete, however you pronounce his name, Buttigieg.  is the best I can do.  Given their utter failure to check the remorseless insurgency of Senator Bernie Sanders, they've come up with what must be the most grotesque, the most grotesque pairing in history, certainly in Western political history.  They want to run The billionaire Michael Bloomberg, former mayor of New York, a Republican, a man who went to the Republican convention and endorsed the presidential campaign of George W. Bush.  a man who didn't even participate in the debates or the primaries up till now, but who's now spending money out of his $67 billion fortune like it was going out of fashion.  But worse, worse even than a president, Michael Bloomberg, would be Hillary Clinton as his running mate.  And that, it appears, is what they intend.  They intend to blow Bernie Sanders out of the water by running Bloomberg and Clinton as their ticket.  Well, in one sense, well look, it's incumbent on me to tell you, I would not encourage anyone, anyone, anyone to vote for Bloomberg and Clinton.  And I think that the great majority of the supporters of Bernie Sanders, if this process is rigged in favour of Bloomberg and Hillary, will never vote for that ticket.  And that means get ready for another four years of Donald J. Trump as president.  Now, lastly, though there are many other issues on the agenda this evening, we have to look at another very, very vexatious issue.  I watched the so-called Corbyn candidate Rebecca Long-Bailey on television today, whose number one priority, number one priority, if she becomes leader of the Labour Party, is to deal with anti-Semitism in the Labour Party.  Mind you, that's the number one priority of all three of the candidates, as spoken on television.  But Rebecca Long Bailey wants to make a law in Britain that if you identify as a woman, you are a woman.  Not that you must be treated like a woman.  As I've already told you, I've already done that.  I had a comrade who was a man whose hand I used to shake, who began to identify as a woman whose cheek I used to kiss.  but who changed back to being a man again and whose hand I now shake.  If somebody wants to identify as a woman, I'm prepared to stand up when they come back to the table, open the door for them to go through first.  I'm ready to kiss their cheek rather than shake their hands.  In other words, I'm ready to treat them as they want to be treated.  But they are not women.  And to make a law which so offends science and logic has to be the most disastrous Labour policy yet.  And yet they're starting to apply it right now inside their own party.  If anyone made the statement I have just made in the British Labour Party, imagine the party of Keir Hardie, the party of Ernest Bevin, the party of James Callaghan, Michael Foote, Tony Benn, you would be expelled forthwith.  from the Labour Party for making the statement that I just made, because their position is that if you identify as a woman, then you are a woman.  This is the edge of madness.  As a matter of fact, it's over the edge.  It's into the chasm of madness.  But that's what Rebecca Long Bailey intends for you in Britain.  We're going to be talking to a man educated at Oxford University who became a rapper, who became a banker, who is an author and a coach.  Of course, he's the legendary Zuby.  And what's his connection to this story?  Well, he's a super strong guy.  So he decided to identify as a woman, albeit briefly, in order to break the women's weightlifting record.  And he is now the world record holder in women's weightlifting, even though he's not a woman and only briefly identified as one in order to break this record, to get into the Guinness Book of Records.  That's where this madness leads.  It leads to men playing in women's football and using the strength and speed they have as men to cut a swathe through the defenses of the women's football team, actual women, that he's playing against.  Boys and men are winning women's sporting events all over the world merely by identifying as women.  I'm sorry.  I cannot remain silent on this.  I have actually tried to stay out, by and large, of this whole affair because it was such a swamp and guaranteed such a backlash on social media.  But hey, I don't need any safeguards.  I can just block lunatics.  And if it gets too hot, I could just not go on social media.  It's quite easy, you know.  You just don't click the button.  I promise you this, it's going to be the mother of all talk shows tonight. ",
