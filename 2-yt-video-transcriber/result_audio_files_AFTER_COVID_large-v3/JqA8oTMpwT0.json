He's just or jerking me around, I meant to say.  And because I think he's using the time machine.  Like yesterday I went in and I said, hey, when's it going to be ready?  And he was like, it'll be ready in exactly 13 days and 11 hours and 15 minutes.  And I was like, wait, how do you know exactly?  And he's like, got to go.  So anyways, that's none of your concern.  Your only concern is this wonderful episode we've got.  And boy, howdy, is it ever a humdinger of a banger?  as we've got calls to Tom Gulley, Michael Dukes, plus the big man himself, Jesse Farrar calls JJ McCartney.

I'm a Canadian, obviously, Ben, as you said there, so I have the benefit of experiencing socialized medicine in my life.

You know, I would have some respect for you, I'll be honest, if you just admitted that it was more important for you to live in a country with a powerful military than it is to live in a country where low-income people don't die when they get sick.

So first of all, the idea that poor people in the United States are dying for lack of care is simply not true.  In fact, there is Medicaid that is available for a huge variety of people who are low income in the United States.  The idea that we have a completely privatized system is nonsense.  We have Medicare available for people who are elderly.  Also, we have emergency care available for everybody by law.  Second, the idea that life expectancy in the United States is dramatically lower than that in Canada neglects to actually adjust for homicide and car accident death.  When you do that, the United States has the longest life expectancy, including in Canada.  Third, people in Canada who actually need emergency, who need any sort of elective care, tend to come to the United States.  Fourth, the notion that Only poor people, that only rich people in the United States have health insurance is absolutely insane.  160 million people in the United States have health insurance coverage through their employer, and the vast majority of those people, by all polling, about 80% of those people, are extremely happy with that health insurance.  So the idea that only rich people in the United States are really happy with their health care in the United States is simply a lie through and through. ",
