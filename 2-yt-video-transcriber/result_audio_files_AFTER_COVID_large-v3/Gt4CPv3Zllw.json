But this mask has now been slipped thanks to Brexit and the trade talks that's been going on.  As you know, on this channel, I've been keeping you guys up to date every day with our Brexit updates.  This week, obviously, has been quite chaotic.  Today, the European team are in London without Michel Barnier because he's a troublemaker.  He's coming tomorrow to beg for the talks to resume.  It's not really looking good for these guys because now we have all the European countries attacking each other, primarily attacking Brussels.  And we're going to go through each one of them, the reactions that we've had.  from various MEPs.  So some of them are taking the UK side, some of them are taking the French side on this with the fisheries.  But first, let's start with Michel Barnier and his latest rant, because he's now exposing himself. ",

He's now taking it seriously.  Really?  I think it's a bit too late, because we now have a number of members of the European Union who have realised that the EU and the negotiating team have been lying to the whole of the continent.  We have people like Nicolas Bey.  who's one of the MEPs, and obviously you're a sceptic, is now obviously criticising the Brussels and the Michel Barnier's team because they've been lying about the whole situation, especially when it comes to fisheries and everything else.  So firstly, let's go to his clip and see what he had to say about No Deal. ",

Germany has already underscored that it's favourable to concessions, and you yourself, Mr Barnier, recently said that we had to be realistic, and I quote, when it comes to access to British waters.  So it will be either weakness or a no deal, the lack of an agreement.  And of course the perspective of failure is not one that's pleasing to me, but unlike what you've been saying for the past four years, the consequences of a no deal would be much worse for the EU than for the UK.

            "text": "Well, that's true.  Nicolas Bey is absolutely right.  As a French MEP, he's now saying that no deal will be worse for the European Union than it is for Britain.  I've been saying this for a long time because the UK is one country.  Managing one country going through a no deal situation is a lot easier than managing 27 countries.  But that's not the only reaction we've had.  We now obviously have... One of the Estonian MEPs, Mr.  Madison, who is now saying that the UK is playing with the EU.  And he said, congratulations, Johnson.  The EU was humiliated over its stance in the Brexit negotiations, according to this Estonian MEP.  Essentially, what he's been saying is that... they've been insisting that the EU should have been much more kind of clever in terms of the way they've handled these negotiations and obviously the no deal scenario.  the consequences will hit the protectionist EU bloc more than obviously the UK.  Also obviously speaking after Guy Verhofstadt he said that it's always funny to hear the speeches of Mr Verhofstadt because he's very active and funny and they're full of power.  So that's one.  But then you also have one of the German MEPs, obviously they're now saying that they won't have their way.  So they've said that Angela Merkel and Ursula von der Leyen, obviously, it's actually essentially their fault.  You've got Macron obviously talking about fisheries and all this stuff, but actually, at the end of the day, the management of the bloc is von der Leyen, and also she's best friends with Angela Merkel.  Merkel has always been the main person in charge of running these puppets.  So that's the biggest problem that they have, because... The German NOP has now said that Britain wanted a Canada-style trade deal and signalled some flexibility.  The EU, in contrast, barely moved, even though it was the European Union that offered a Canada-style trade deal, obviously with some differences.  Negotiations are discussions between parties with diverging views, but a shared interest in finding a compromise.  The EU, notably Germany, has a vast trade surplus with the UK.  And that's absolutely spot on.  We have been quite clear about the fact that we just want a trade deal.  The EU hasn't helped.  The MEP continues by saying that Yet the German presidency and the Commission remain committed to an unequal treaty on EU terms.  So that's one problem.  And also Merkel and von der Leyen know not to negotiate because they know not when to compromise.  That way they will not have their way.  That's also very, very true.  Now one of the Belgian MEPs is also now kicking off because the whole situation with... Obviously, the battle between France and fisheries and Brussels itself creating this protectionist mentality is the reason that the talks are now collapsing.  So, I mean, it's been always clear, but I genuinely think it's not even just about fisheries.  They want much more. ",

And we want to show that there is an alternative to this, an alternative to the super state of the EU.  If Brexit is a success, other countries will no doubt seek to imitate this, and that's what the EU wants to avoid at any cost. ",

At this point, while he's saying if Brexit is a success, I would say when Brexit is a success, things will change regardless of this whole situation.  And yes, there will be other countries that will look at the situation and say, well, we don't have to be in this club anymore.  So you have obviously now.  Belgian politicians, you have German politicians, you've got French politicians attacking Brussels.  And then, well, you have, on the other hand, people who have a different view, the Europhiles.  So one of them has actually now said that Boris Johnson will have no friends left in the world if Brexit happens, especially if no deal Brexit actually happens.  This is a Spanish politician.  who's said that with all this going on, it makes it even more incomprehensible that Boris Johnson is burning every bridge with the European Union, condemning the UK's economy.  Sure, if Donald Trump loses the election, Boris Johnson will have no friends left in the world.  Again, I find it fascinating when I hear this from politicians, people who are in politics.  If I hear it from a random person or someone in the media, a journalist, yeah, but you are in politics, you know how the system works.  There's nothing to do with the friendship between a president or a prime minister.  The UK is one of the top countries in the world with one of the top soft superpowers.  It's not just that.  America is our friend.  You know, we're also friends with Canada, with Australia, with a number of other European countries.  We're still friends with France and Germany, despite all this.  We have alliances with, you know, Far East Asia, South Korea, Japan.  People think this is some sort of playground game where, oh, it's just going to be Trump and Boris Johnson standing in a corner in the backyard.  Not sure that's how it works.  And then you have a situation with Charles Michel.  who is obviously the head of the European Council, who's also kicking off essentially at this point because fisheries is very important for him.  Fisheries is the red line.  OK, Charles. ",

No, we just want free access to UK waters.  Okay, Charles Michel.  And then I guess you have another MEP from Finland who's talking about how Boris Johnson is actually doing the right thing and Boris has to defend UK waters and the British sovereignty.  This is actually my favourite speech of the day, over the last few days because it actually shows the true side of the European Parliament.  I have a message for Boris Johnson.  defend your fishing waters, etc.  You have now an opportunity to take your sovereignty back. ",

They're saying that at least try your best to get a trade deal with Britain, because no deal is going to be worth for the continent, well, the mainland, Europe.  So this is the whole problem that we have.  I don't think these guys are understanding the situation because, as I said, today, Wednesday, we have the EU's negotiating team in London.  And apparently Michel Barnier is joining them tomorrow.  God knows what's going to happen there.  But I will keep you guys posted as usual on this channel.
