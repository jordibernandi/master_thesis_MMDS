This video is entitled, The New Age Family Won't Work.  I was watching a video and having these conversations over time where, you know, people are getting away from marriage.  And I'm speculating when I say, you know, when people say family nowadays, they're thinking of mother and children or mother, children, and mother's family.  Mother's immediate family, right?  As the nuclear family.  And I think to myself, we've seen this fail so many times and it keeps going further and further and further because people want to view that as a family.  Well, it's not going to work.  Hasn't worked in the past, not working in the present.  So the best indicator of future results is past and present, right?  So it's going to only get worse.  uh for for our women you know like they keep saying the number keeps increasing with black men who don't have children and you know you know we are made to procreate both men and women.  uh but women have this thing where they're going to be a mother.  and i think the the the The yearn to be a mother outweighs the yearn to be a wife, which outweighs the yearn to have a family.  So, wow, this is an interesting song to play right now.  That's interesting.  I didn't do that.  But what winds up happening is, You see these women, baby showers, women at the baby showers, telling all the women how happy they are to be a mother.  You see these women who are single, who have kids, who don't want to be married, because we don't talk about that part either, where there are a lot of women who don't want to be wives.  They want to have weddings.  They want to get a ring, but they don't want to be wives.  So either they can't, you know, have cold feet before the wedding or they file for divorce.  I know we go into this dynamic that, you know, the majority of divorces are filed by women, right?  But we go into this dynamic that the men did something to end the marriage.  He cheated.  He abused the woman, but we never take, you know, we never say she cheated or she abused the man.  She just didn't want to be a wife to that man or just a wife in general.  She's like, ah, she thought she wanted it.  And then she changed her mind in the middle of it.  We don't talk about that part, but after that's over with, we're going to still view this as a family, mother and child family, but does it work?  No.  You know, the vast majority, most children from single-parent households who wind up becoming productive adults, they leave the nest.  You know, the days are getting, are separating from take care of your mama.  Now it's like too many Children have been scarred by their mama.  Too many children have been played by their moms.  You get what I'm saying?  Too many lives have been told to fracture the relationships between fathers and the father side of the family.  And too many people have went down a road of, you know, boys grow to be men and figure out what happened to the... The negative things that happen to their dad, okay?  Not going to call these guys deadbeats, but they come to see the games that are played that they were in the middle of.  that they didn't think of.  Some girls grow up to be women and figure out the same thing.  And sometimes, you know, they also figure out that How can I say this?  They figure out the games mom plays so she can get away with the same thing because she doesn't want the father in these kids' lives.  And the reason I'm bringing this up is because the new age family won't work because some of these women are having children because they wanted children.  They plan to be single mothers.  We don't want to talk about these quote unquote families where women plan to be single mothers.  They wanted to have a baby.  They didn't care who they cared somewhat who they had a baby with, but they wanted to have a baby.  You know, and when they had the baby, this is when, you know, they say the guys just walk away from their responsibility because they didn't, you know, they just punked out.  Well.  I give you that.  There are guys who just, you know, was having unprotected sex with this woman, and now she got pregnant.  All that smooth talk.  he was talking, he punked out and he ran.  Yeah, I give you that.  That does happen.  But there's another part that happens on the other side.  When a guy is unprotected sex, and the woman gets pregnant, and he's like, wait.  This ain't what we talked about.  And you told me, you know, you was on a pill.  I am.  You are on a pill, but you're not.  You told me you was on a shot.  You told me your tooth was tied.  You told me, you know what I'm saying, I'm allergic.  But I'm on birth control.  You lied.  I got an IUD.  Now, there are scenarios when these things happen and a woman gets pregnant.  That's very much so true.  If a guy, he finds out the situation, he gonna say, I got trapped, then he gonna find out the truth.  I'm like, oh, okay, I'm in that percentile.  But there are other guys there.  The reason I gotta bring this up is because these women plan pregnancies, and when they get pregnant, this is the family that they want.  Just, you know, you gotta think about How quick people want to put people on child support.  If you want to put a person on child support right when you had a baby, you never intended to have a family with this person.  That's what this is about.  You never intended to have a family with this person.  You never intended to raise a child together.  But the new age family won't work.  Because what happens?  The support system over time gets tight.  See... I hate to bring this up, but there are a good number of women who ran out of help.  Mama don't help no more.  Sisters and brothers don't help no more.  Aunts and uncles don't help no more.  Why is that?  Because even the family gets tired of helping.  The family gets tired of keeping dad at bay and taking up the slack and then realizing, oh, wait a minute, I'm not going to give my life to this cause because that kid got a father.  But we've been fighting for this kid not to have a father.  But I don't want to take my time to keep helping raise this kid.  Wait, you got to figure this out on your own.  Oh.  So it doesn't work.  So these women, as these children get older, they increasingly get left by themselves and that's the family.  You know.  You see this over and over again.  And then And then at the time, and I got to say this, one of the big reasons, in my opinion, a new age family won't work, don't work.  A lot of ladies want to have, women want to be mothers, but women want to be mothers of babies.  Women want to have babies.  You hear most women talk about, we give life, we birth children, we have babies.  They're not talking about that.  toddlers, preteens, teenagers, young adults.  The mindset just stops babies.  Once they start walking and talking and having a personality, it's a whole different thing.  Raising them is a whole different thing.  And what you see is a lot of mothers get blamed for not raising their children.  They get credit for having children, but they get discredited for not raising them.  And this is part of the reason why there's the fallouts, even with their own family, friends, and their inner circle.  Because they don't raise the children properly.  So these new age families are not working.  And then you're seeing more and more depictions of a family being what?  A mother and a child.  So what you're looking at is guys like, oh, yeah, yeah, all right.  So it's a deadbeat setup from the jump.  You know?  And you hear all of these, these men are like this, these men are like that, these men are... No, no, no, no.  It's not that other men don't are better fathers.  It's just, you know... It's gotten to the point where you're going to have to go elsewhere to find guys who are going to slip up and be fathers.  And the one thing I can say that's going to hurt people's feelings, new age family won't work because a lot of people are trying to date interracially or interethnically or in a different ethnicity to circumvent.  you know, that their group figured out that the jig is up and they're not playing the game no more.  But there's a little two-pronged system where you want to keep these other ethnicities, so you're going to deny yourself from having a baby.  Or you're going to, you know, play the game that just hold on, baby type of thing.  Or you're going to do it and do the same thing to them and then you're going to deal with it in a whole different way.  And it's going to be a whole other problem.  Or their families don't want it to happen.  Or their families abandon you.  But that's why I'm saying the new age family won't work.  Not to mention, you know, these kids ain't getting no money out of the deal.  They ain't getting no inheritance.  They ain't getting no legacy.  They just started from scratch, from scratch, from scratch, from scratch, from scratch.  Because I just want to be a mother.  Okay.  You didn't want to be a family.  There's no benefit because... You know, after the child support is over with, guess what?  There's no guarantee that dad has to actually provide anything after that because you might've taught these children to be disrespectful to the dad that was providing.  I'm just saying.  So it doesn't really work.  So like, share, subscribe, catch on the next one.  Peace. ",
