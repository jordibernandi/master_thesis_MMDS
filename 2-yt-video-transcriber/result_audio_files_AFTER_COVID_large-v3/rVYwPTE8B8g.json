            "text": "Hey guys, it's me, your favorite celebrity.  I just want you to know, you gotta stay in your home right now.  It's the only way we're gonna make it through this.  But don't worry, everything's gonna be fine.  I promise you.  And I know you're stuck in your little apartment right now.  I know what that's like.  I'm stuck on the grounds of my estate too.  This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do.  But look, we're all in this together.  I know you miss me, which is why I feel so much purpose connecting with you on social media.  And look, we all have our part in this experience.  My part is to educate you, inspire you, and uplift you throughout this experience.  I know you appreciate me taking the time to tell you how to live during this crisis.  You know, seriously, stay in your home.  It is so important.  I'm suffering just as much as you are during this.  Hashtag one world.  I feel like a normal blue collar person too.  I'm just famous.  I know so many of you have lost jobs during this time and I don't think anyone understands what that's like more than me.  My wealth has dropped during this crisis.  It looks like my latest movie isn't going to come out on time.  This is going to be a summer release.  Everything's going to be fine.  so don't be a hoarder and buy too much at the grocery store.  We have to make sure there's enough for everyone.  I can't even tell you how bored I am being stuck on my estate.  I'm not even in my Malibu beach home.  There's no ocean here.  Swear I'm gonna have a breakdown.  But you gotta be positive.  And I know things are scary.  You might be sick but unable to get a test.  There's limited supplies.  You've gotta just play your part and be patient.  We all do.  I've got my stockpile of tests.  I'm taking one every hour on the hour because I'm famous and have a high net worth.  But my supply's only gonna last another three weeks at this rate.  And then I don't know what I'm gonna do.  Don't forget about me.  I'm still relevant.  When all this is over, I'm going to have some movies come out.  And guys, I think the coronavirus has really exposed the vulnerabilities of the industrial food system and grocery stores.  So I think it's important at this time that you start growing your own food.  And it doesn't matter how many acres you have, just grow what you can.  And guys, when you're stuck at home, it's really important that you stay committed to your fitness.  You just got to do whatever you can do, whether that's doing pushups on your dirty floor or riding your Peloton.  You really got to keep your discipline up.  I mean, that's what I'm doing.  My personal trainer isn't able to come here to train me, so I'm just making do with what I have.  You know, I was listening to a song the other day, and I decided it would help guide you through this difficult time.  I also decided it would be more powerful and pure if I sang it to you instead.  Imagine all the people Living for today.  That was beautiful.  I think that's really gonna pull you through this difficult time.  Stay in your home.  What's up you weirdo?  Just one more thing before I get kicked out of this estate I broke into to film this video for you.  I want to invite you to my live stream comedy show this Friday night.  I'm doing them each and every Friday until the quarantine ends.  The live comedy show is called Friday Night Still Alive.  First couple shows.  we've had massive turnouts.  Beautiful feedback.  And we've got an all new show coming to you this Friday.  You can click the link in the description of this video.  You can also go to awakenwithjp.com slash live to register and buy your ticket.  It's just $9.95 to get into the live comedy show.  And that money just goes towards putting some food on my table and food in my dog's dishes.  So it's my way of helping give you a night out while you're stuck in your own living room.  See you this Friday.  Just hanging with my dad, doing my book.  Oh man, you're doing your book?  Yeah.  Yep.  You'll be doing your mom later. ",
