            "text": "Hello everyone.  I decided against making a video about the coronavirus today because I feel like it's all that anybody's been talking about since January and I assume that, like me, many of you feel a bit burnt out and would prefer some variety.  If I'm wrong in assuming that though, please do let me know and I'll try to make some videos about it in the future.  For the moment, though, I will just say that the most recent update here in Austria is that the lockdown is starting to lift.  Since Monday, the Austrian government has started to slowly reopen the economy, making them one of the first countries in the entire world to do so.  So I will be sure to let you know how it goes.  Anyway, for today's video, we're going to talk about something completely unrelated.  I'm sure that many of you are probably familiar with the viral story from I think it was December of 2019, about a polyamorous relationship that consisted of one woman and four different men.  The woman had gotten pregnant by one of the men, and apparently the whole group had agreed upon raising the baby together.  At the time, the story was promoted by a variety of mainstream media outlets, from the New York Post to The Sun to Mail Online to Metro.  And now, several months later, it's recently been revealed that one of the men in this relationship has been charged with aggravated child abuse because he fractured the baby's arm, leg, ribs, and skull when it was just five weeks old.  Thankfully, the baby will not suffer any permanent damage and is expected to make a full recovery.  Now, I am certainly not claiming that all polyamorous relationships are destined to inevitably end in abuse.  I am not saying that at all, although I do personally oppose polyamorous relationships on moral grounds and I don't really understand how such a relationship could possibly be genuine or healthy.  It's more about why, particularly in the media and on social media platforms like Twitter, for example, you seem to have this bizarre fascination with inverting fundamental and healthy societal norms and then presenting this inversion as a positive thing.  You have heaps of praise for polyamorous relationships.  You have praise for girls prostituting themselves on OnlyFans.  And just as a quick side note, due to the coronavirus, OnlyFans has apparently seen a 75% increase in signups.  with more than 170,000 new users each day.  Patreon reported 50,000 new creators in March, its fastest ever rate of growth.  You also have the consistent devaluation of fatherhood and relentless criticism of men in general.  You have criticism of the nuclear family and stay-at-home moms.  You even have criticism of people who choose to have children.  In contrast to the reaction to the polyamorous relationship that I mentioned in the beginning of this video, look at the reaction to this admittedly dorky, but overall normal photo of a mother posing in matching outfits with her children.  Really dark in such a layered way, I can't fully wrap my head around it.  So much to unpack, but seemingly willfully having four children in 2020 is always so dark to me.  This is what Hitler wanted.  It's a white supremacy wet dream.  In response to these comments, one woman made an excellent point.  please tell me if this was a beautiful black woman with gorgeous healthy looking children in a nice clean house.  believe me there are many of my sisters who are that blessed.  will people still describe the picture as dark?  someone even went so far as to accuse the mother of tying the children together by a cord when you can clearly see in the photo that the cord is behind them and it's a treadmill cord plugged into the wall.  and last but not least my personal favorite You innately understand that the mom is trying to create her idea of a perfect family by grooming, controlling the children to be exactly what she wants them to be, which will have devastating psychological effects on them as they grow up.  You know pain is coming to this family.  To react to a dorky but perfectly normal photo with such twisted accusations and animosity does far more in revealing the darkness of the person who posted this comment than anything else.  In fact, if you look at the Twitter account of the woman who initially criticized the photo of the mother and her children, the woman's timeline is chock full of tweets talking about how depressed and unhappy she is.  It's already been said a thousand times before, but there really is truth to the claim that this push to invert fundamental societal norms is coming as a result of indoctrination from the mainstream media, the education system, Hollywood, etc.  Indoctrination to hate the nuclear family, monogamy, masculinity, and even the notion of acquiring success based on merit as opposed to what ethnicity you are or what sexual orientation you identify with or whether you're a man or a woman.  It's a concerted effort to destroy natural order, which in turn is going to destroy our society.  But this, of course, we can never let them do.  If there's any silver lining at all to this whole coronavirus lockdown, perhaps it's that we've been given a rare opportunity to rediscover the importance of family.  Or if you don't have a family, then of finding a close unit of friends or perhaps getting married and starting a family of your own.  Because given how disastrously many of the world governments have handled the coronavirus outbreak, it's become more apparent than ever that they're unreliable and that we as citizens aren't always the highest priority.  In the end, family and friends are really all we have.  Thank you so much for watching everyone.  I really hope you enjoyed and I'll see you all soon. ",
