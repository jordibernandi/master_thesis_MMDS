            "text": "Now we have men out here, good-looking dudes.  You know, probably in the top 25% of men.  You've got Terrence Popp.  Even Blake isn't too bad.  Right, Blake?  You've got Coach Greg Adams, Sidney MGTOW.  You've got Undead Chronic.  You've got Better Bachelor.  You've got Mystery Elite.  You've got all these guys with their faces on the line, and they're saying, no, no, no, mm-hmm.  No, enough.  You got to get your shit together before we're going to even consider coming back.  We're off the plantation.  We don't need you.  Speaking of women.  However, it seems women seem to need us regardless of what we look like.  Well, there's some man driving that truck over there.  Well, that's his job.  It's a male role.  And then the next fucking breath.  We shouldn't be put into gender roles because it's societal constructions.  They just don't even see the irony of what they're saying.  Well, they don't care.  Because from a little girl, daddy has always said, you're so special.  You're the best.  You deserve Prince Charming.  And then when Prince Charming is busy delivering toilet paper to the target, well, they don't see that.  They just know it's going to be there.  Just like the electricity coming out of the outlet, well, it's just going to be there.  Why do I have to care about what's going on behind the scenes?  I'm a whammon, and if I don't get what I want, I'll just throw a fit and go back, Daddy, it's not fair.  These men are oppressing me.  You get into a situation like this where soon you're going to have women eating cat food because they didn't think ahead.  Women do not future.  Now, I know I'm generalizing and stereotyping.  Whatever.  F off.  I could go and break it down, but nobody cares about that.  The point is, in general, women do not future.  They want now.  Now.  I want this now.  I want the new car now.  I want this and I want this stud now.  And blah, blah, freaking blah.  And there's never a care in the world.  I'm a woman.  Why wouldn't I just get this shit for free?  And now they're not.  It's like, wait a minute.  I have to do something.  I have to be an adult to go down to the grocery store and get food and pay for it myself.  I've never done that before.  It's always been free drinks Fridays, free meal Saturdays.  And all I had to do was give some dude a sniff of the pea sleeve or just the thought of that sniff.  And I go, oh, for now, what am I going to do?  But the bottom line is, MGTOW, Red Pill, all of these men walking away from this whole situation, off the plantation.  If the top shelf men do not do the same, they don't care.  Notice the explosion of bitching.  when recently the Wall Street bankers and some of these other high-level guys that they truly want has said, no, no, no, no more mentoring, no, no, no, no more one-on-one, no more drinks after work, no more dinners, nope, nope.  And the women are going, why?  But I want it.  I should be allowed to do this, man.  But your sister said, if I looked at you wrong, you can, without evidence, get me fired from my job.  Well, I would never do that.  That's not me.  That's those other people.  Bullshit.  The smart men are saying no.  Now you made your bed.  Feminists, haven't you?  Now you don't like it, but just like everything else, I didn't think ahead to what might be the consequence.  It's not fair.  I'm oppressed.  And that's why we need feminism.  Isn't that what they're going to say?  Of course it is.  James Maxwell, thank you for listening. ",
