            "text": "In case you've been in a coma or maybe you're just overwhelmed with all the news about how the apocalypse is going these days, last week, thousands of alt-right fascists, white supremacists, Donald Trump supporters stormed the United States Capitol armed with guns, flags and fire extinguishers used to be a cop to death, and tasers.  Social media is tricky in big, scary events like this, where people desperately crave information that they can't really get from the mainstream news.  It happens with destructive earthquakes and hurricanes and terrorist attacks, and it happened last week.  People hit social media, they see some information that's interesting or they think crucial, and they share it, often without stopping to consider whether or not that information is true.  Because sometimes people post information that they think is correct, but it isn't.  And at other times, people post knowingly false information in order to get attention, to get laughs, or just specifically to screw people over because they're assholes.  And that can be dangerous, like in the case of natural disasters, when people are using social media to share important information about where people can find refuge or supplies.  That's why in currently ongoing crises, I try not to retweet or otherwise share information that hasn't been verified.  Like Nazis are breaking into the United States Capitol, as they have been promising to do for weeks.  And as you can clearly see on these TV news channels, that's verified information.  And I don't mind sharing it.  But there are a lot of other like on the ground reports that you don't necessarily know are true until there's some sort of corroboration.  And I encourage you to do the same thing, to not share information that's not been verified, as hard as that can be.  It's difficult to sit at home and see all of these updates happening from people who claim to be on the ground and to not help spread the word, especially when they're saying particularly important or interesting things.  Things like, I don't know, a man just died of a heart attack after he repeatedly accidentally tased himself in the testicles.  And yeah, that's what we're gonna talk about today.  Kevin Greeson was a Trump fanatic and extremist who loved guns.  He posted on social media about how he wanted Nancy Pelosi to get COVID and die.  He encouraged other alt-right extremists to, quote, take this fucking country back, load your guns and take to the streets.  He regularly begged Donald Trump on Twitter to send in the army to stop Black Lives Matter protesters.  He replied to a story about a woman who was shot while protesting yesterday.  Don't be out after curfew, the simple things in life some folks really struggle with.  So it's deeply ironic that Greeson showed up in DC last week as part of a mob attempting to violently break into the US Capitol in order to arrest and possibly murder representatives, but he experienced a massive heart attack that killed him instantly.  Before I go any further, let me say that Greeson did not deserve to die.  I personally don't think anyone deserves to die.  I'm a humanist.  I think that all humans deserve life and health and education and rehabilitation.  But I'm also a realist who feels that we should all appreciate the fact that we all die one day and to find humor in our lives and our deaths.  And I find intense satisfaction in irony.  The fact that a man brandished assault rifles and told his fellow white supremacists that that he would be coming to DC with guns and ammo only to be immediately killed by his own faulty heart.  I mean, if you were to write this morality play, it would be criticized for being a little on the nose.  Anyway, there's no dispute that Greeson died of a massive heart attack.  What is in dispute is what may have led to that heart attack, whether or not he accidentally tased himself and whether or not he accidentally tased himself in the balls.  When I first heard that version of his death, I was skeptical.  And spoiler alert, I am still skeptical.  If a heart attack is on the nose, then ball tasing is somewhere up inside the sinus cavity.  But obviously, this is a very funny story.  So it spread on social media quite quickly, prompting the legendary debunking site Snopes to publish an article quickly stating that the ball-tasing claim is rated as false.  While I respect Snopes and the good work that they've done in the past, I'm here to tell you that their rating on this particular ball-tasing is wrong and bad and poor investigative journalism.  Does that mean I'm saying that Kevin Greeson did die via ball-tasing?  No.  Let's go through this step by step.  I promise there is something to learn here.  When examining a subject like this, it's important to note where the burden of proof lies.  Generally, the burden of proof lies with whoever is making the claim.  Like if you say the earth is flat, it's not suddenly on me to prove that. ",
