            "text": "I'm sure we saw the other day that Kim Jong-un is apparently dead, according to CNN, and the tweet that they deleted, once they realized they kind of just made that up.  Now, it wasn't just the United States and CNN that reported that he had died, and those reports have now changed to him being in critical condition after a heart surgery incident.  etc.  Russian media also did this as well, which would tend to lend credibility to the claim because it was not just the United States completely making things up.  And it was CNN who said that Yonhap News Agency, the state-run South Korean media who create, are the source for this claim.  Yonhap has come back and said, no, they don't have any evidence that Kim Jong-un is dead.  They don't even have any evidence of his ill health to begin with.  So again, when it's news about the DPRK, expect no bloody consistency whatsoever because pretty much everybody just makes everything up.  Now that is not to say that this couldn't be true.  Obviously, when you are overweight, you are going to suffer from health problems.  It's not like I wouldn't know about that myself.  I do have negative health effects due to my own weight.  That happens.  But there's a difference between claiming somebody is dead and claiming that their health is bad.  I wouldn't be surprised if Kim Jong-il's health wasn't that good because of his weight, because that's what being overweight does.  Unless, of course, you're healthy at any size.  So, in the end, baseless accusation.  We're going to wait until the DPRK actually says something, because try not to forget how many times they reported Kim Jong-il had died.  until he actually did die.  And you know, the entire history of literally all news coming out of the West being completely unreliable when it comes to the DPRK. ",
