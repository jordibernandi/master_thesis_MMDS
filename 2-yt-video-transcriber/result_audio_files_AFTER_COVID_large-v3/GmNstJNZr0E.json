He was a traitor who resigned his commission because he would rather fight on the side of slavery, and then he died like a bitch.  What are you going to do?  Worthy arguments.  I don't know.  What does this have to do with him being a statue?  It seems like he kind of sucked one of the big.  one of the big lies that gets told.  a lot is like People will say oh, yeah, dude, like lee wasn't that bad.  He was just like a hero for a state.  No, dude, listen, I don't care if you just really like your fucking home southern state.  Okay, if if you're fighting for slavery, you're fighting for slavery.  Okay, chill.  um What would you say about a concentration camp guard who's just happy to be a part of resurrecting the glory of ancient Germany or something?  It doesn't matter.  You're still doing the thing.  This is just pro-slavery.  I actually don't know what to say.  Yeah, we also didn't talk about that.  But Lee also didn't want the Confederate states memorialized.  He wouldn't want statues of Confederate soldiers.  Yeah, why don't we have more John Brown statues?  That's the real shit.  Here's why Lee's statue should remain.  Oh yeah, and then they tweet this.  I don't know, my dude PragerU.  You literally just put out a video that was like, Here's why we should keep Robert E. Lee statues up.  He fought to keep slavery and thought slavery was good for the blacks.  Also, he crushed a slave rebellion by radical abolitionist John Brown.  What?  It's so interesting how they say that the Democratic Party was the party of slavery, as the Democratic Party was the party of the Confederacy, except these days it's always Republicans who defend the Confederate flag, always Republicans who say the South will rise again, always Republicans who defend Confederate statues.  That's so interesting, dude.  If it's really the Democrats who were the party of slavery, Jim Crow and the fucking Confederacy and shit like that, it's so crazy how the Republican Party is the one who now lays claim to their cultural legacy.  That's so weird.  Um, yeah, I like the was over here.  Also, was the party of emancipation racial integration?  Hold on there, bucko.  Emancipation?  You mean like what John Brown tried to do?  Racial integration?  You mean like what Robert E. Lee opposed?  What are we talking about here?  I mean, I will admit, I wonder who wrote that, like, that segment.  I bet, I wish I could, like, get into the internal workings, because I bet that video was written by, like, a white nationalist, I'd be willing to bet.  Usually, because the way these YouTube projects work, it's not like Dennis Prager writes every script.  It's usually, like, they get outsourced and people, like, claim to make one project or another.  And I have a feeling that one was definitely fucking written by, like, a griper or something like that.  How much does PragerU make?  I don't know.  PragerU is AstroTurf, though.  It gets its money from oil billionaires.  Dennis Prager himself is quite wealthy.  Yeah.  Cringe. ",
