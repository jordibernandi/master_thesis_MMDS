            "text": "Yeah, and I guess this ties into another endless debate that happens in these spheres, which is the applicability of cultural Marxism as an interpretive framework of the past century or whatever, you know, the post-World War II period, and the question of how much of the, you know, the degeneracy and the things that people normally pinpoint as being the result of cultural Marxism, you know, whether it's LGBT or the breakdown of traditional marriage and the family and so on, you know, all the forms of degeneracy we're familiar with, how much that's the fault of academic subversion by people like the Frankfurt School and kind of a concerted effort by radical leftists ",

            "text": "insert this moral rot into the mainstream.  Or how much this is just the logical effects of capitalism.  And again, that commodification process where all of these traditional forms of life, uh, any traditional social order is a limit to commodification.  It's a limit to profit.  Uh, it's a limit to this growth imperative and that the tendency of capitalism is always to turn limits into barriers and to overcome those barriers.  And.  you know, traditional moral orders, national identity, all of these things are limits to growth and limits to commodification, and so it only makes sense in the capitalist logic that they would be transformed into barriers and overcome, and that the absolute moral wrath and degeneracy is just that kind of natural expression of capitalism in this late stage.  Now, you know, there is a case at the same time, I think that would much more be my opinion, in terms of, you know, the breakdown of identity being a necessary effect of capitalism.  But at the same time, you know, there are obvious effects of the work of people like Adorno and Marcuse.  And, you know, there obviously was somewhat of a combative approach or attitude to, I guess, what we might consider Western civilization.  And, you know, there's a tendency for people to say, well, you're absolving the bad characters involved of the role in this.  And, you know, if you have this kind of structural explanation that you're lessening the effect that these radicals had on things.  So, again, I'm interested where you'd stand on that.  You're obviously very familiar with the Frankfurt School. ",

            "text": "Yeah, I mean, I agree with you that what we're really talking about here is cultural capitalism.  So if we take what is capitalism trying to do, it's essentially trying to homogenize the world into consumer units so that you purchase your identity.  Everything becomes commodified.  Right.  This is why it takes on a very Gnostic look to it.  Right.  What was Gnosticism?  It's that the physical world and essentialist notions of the self or race or culture is degraded and created by an evil God.  So the goal is to gain the proper knowledge of who you are, and that's how you get salvation.  It's a flight away from the material.  It's a flight into ultimately abstraction.  So now if you look at the way capitalism is, why is it that we're having such a proliferation of, say, trance or anti-racialism or non-essentialist notions of man, of which man is malleable, is because it's essentially removing us from these physical and social and cultural expressions, which are our barriers.  to commodification.  And the reason there are barriers is because only notions of higher meaning that can't be satisfied by an economy of desire, which is based on face needs, on fake needs, is the only bulwark against that.  That's why I like the traditionalist worker party slogan, faith, family, and folk.  That perfectly encapsulates what real resistance to capitalism is.  So now if we look at the Frankfurt School, The story is a little more complicated than the traditional right wing's telling of it actually is.  So if you look at Adorno and Horkheimer, for example, as early as the 1930s, they actually gave up on critical theory as trying to bring about social change.  They were very pessimistic.  The story that they tell in Dialectic of the Enlightenment is basically one in which instrumental reason comes to dominate and push us away from religion and culture and other sources of meaning, and even destroys art.  I mean, Adorno was famously hateful towards jazz music, and he was all about high art.  If Adorno was in that debate between Stryker and Destiny, he would have been on Stryker's side.  All right, that's just a fact.  Now, this is where it starts to get a little more complicated, because then you have other Frankfurt School figures like Herbert Marcusek, herbert marcusa.  he had actually worked for the state department as an anti-fascist during the war and then after the war he was monitored by the fbi but he was also weaponized by the cia.  why was he weaponized by the cia?  because for marcusa what he thought was that this which he actually identified i think correctly.  what we've been talking about is that the way in which we move and become a one-dimensional man instead of one capable of critical thinking is because democratic unfreedom coupled with industrialization prevails to such an extent that we start to identify with the ideology of the state, which is homogenization, meaninglessness, consumerism.  What the American way of life means means freedom and liberty away from these ethnic groups.  understandings of ourselves and it, of course, destroys value in the process.  This was something Marc Huser was talking about and he was completely right about.  But now where he becomes a problem and where I think that story is only very minutely correct about cultural Marxism is his answer to this was saying we have to look for moments of rupture in which Those that are traditionally left outside seats of power and are outside of this homogenization process can affect liberation from it.  They can bring about two-dimensional thinking.  They can bring about a critical attitude towards the prevailing ideology.  So he looked to the feminist movements.  He looked to gay rights movements.  And, of course, this is where it becomes a problem because for him, his reasoning is dialectical.  You look at the domination, then you look at the opposition, and then you try to effect a change from that.  And so he was weaponized by the CIA.  They funded a lot of his work and distributed a lot of his work.  And the reason he did that is because they wanted a left that was friendly to American hegemony.  So if you look at the Soviet Union, this was the Cold War.  They're trying to counteract dialectical materialism.  They're trying to counteract bourgeois and proletariat way of thinking about the problems of the world.  And they want to be like, this totalitarian state, the Soviet Union, which it definitely was, is something that the new left in the 60s was starting to become critical of.  They were starting to look to all these other minority identities and to pull them up, right?  So how does the elites, how do they deal with this?  They go, okay, well, we have this great philosopher who's telling these leftists that it's all about becoming free to realize yourself, right?  It's becoming free to push your minority identity and to rupture the system.  And so it ended up becoming a method of helping to co-opt and solidify American hegemony from that new left form of resistance.  And the reason that that happened, of course, is because what we see right now, you take a look at the black experience in America, For example, you have these groups that were traditionally obviously not at the seat of power.  Right.  They were the ones, you know, slaves.  And then, you know, then you had Jim Crow.  We had all these things.  And so they were.  they were resentful over that.  So they go, OK, well, this is how we can help fight the Soviet left.  Let's bring these people up.  Let's let's let's use it as a part of pulling them into this economy of needs.  Let's sublimate that dissent.  And now it becomes a part of the way the system functions.  And so the reason they did this was because it aided neoliberalism.  Not because they wanted cultural Marxism.  This wasn't subversive professors that just somehow influenced a majority white nation and subverted it.  It was very particular work of the elites that saw a weakness in this project.  And they saw how it tied together with what they were trying to do, right?  And so now we're in a position where whites are scapegoated, because in order to make it look alike, you know, they are woke, that they care about the poor and the oppressed.  They're going to scapegoat us as the traditional holders of power.  And then at the same time, these minority groups are going to become the bludgeon against criticisms of neoliberalism.  So Marcuse, where he went wrong, was very much in his dialectical thinking.  Now, if you look at another Frankfurt School figure, you look at Walter Benjamin, when he wrote theses on the concept of history, he was actually criticizing the materialist and Marxist worldview, which he thought could very easily become co-opted by the state and can turn on any dissidents that are trying to criticize it.  It draws them up into it precisely by satisfying their needs.  So now we're in a place right now where it's like, Congratulations, you replaced a powerful man with a black woman as some CEO position.  This was very much a planned part of solidifying neoliberal hegemony.  This wasn't from just subversion into some pretty system in which American capitalism has somehow always been good.  It hasn't.  It led to the state where it is.  It was not just from some obscure philosopher's right.  Marcuse certainly played a role and he I would say later on he actually got pessimistic about it himself.  And I don't want to absolve him.  I think the weakness in his understanding helped influence what would later become in the academy as like the post-colonial studies, the gender studies, all that proliferated from this reconfiguring class and dialectic between bourgeois and proletariat into oppressor and oppressed and minority groups.  He did play a role, but ultimately it's not really, he was more of a pawn in that game.  It was not that he somehow changed the minds of the entirety of America and made it hate itself.  There was no perfect capitalism.  There was no perfect rising liberalism.  There was no perfect financial empire.  It was planned and that is exactly the way that it went. ",
