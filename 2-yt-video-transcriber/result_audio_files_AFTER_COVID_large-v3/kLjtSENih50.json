Now the fourth suspect has been caught in the attempted carjacking brutal murder of Dwayne Williams, 65 years old, retired firefighter, 28 year vet on the force.  The fourth suspect name is Jalen Salisbury, 19 years old of Chicago Heights.  He was found in Pennsylvania.  The other three suspects, One of them named Darren Barron, 20 years old, of Linwood.  All appear to be from the south suburbs.  Dwayne Johnson, 18 years old, of Gary, Indiana.  And 15-year-old, his information is not being released.  Of course, he's a minor.  I want to bring you guys to the story.  This does not look like an attempted carjacking to me.  It looks as if the suspects... That's the car right there.  They got the license plates and everything.  It looks as if the car... It looks like they ran right past this car.  It looked like they... Look, they jumped out and ran right past the car and started blasting at him.  Those are the suspects there.  And he blasted back.  Boom.  I was hoping he blasted all of them and laid them all down.  They're calling this attempted carjacking.  If I'm a carjacker, I'm going to at least wait until you open the car door, at least put the keys in the ignition, at least.  So they're all facing first-degree murder, one count of unlawful use of weapon.  It was only a matter of time.  The other three suspects were caught at the end of December.  This fourth one was just now found yesterday.  Now, I want to bring you guys, this is where it happened at here. ",
