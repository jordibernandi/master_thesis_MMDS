He's just ignorantly assuming that if the video is dated July 18th, 2020, then Stephen Kozar should be asking why he hasn't removed all of those old videos.  And I know a bit about how this works.  But Stephen Kozar doesn't ask that because he has no idea what's going on.  Stephen Kozar obviously doesn't understand server-side scripting. ",

But the problem is that the clip where Benny Hinn is asking for $1,000 is an old video.  Let's compare it to the one from September.  You can see that these days Benny Hinn's hair is mostly white, but in the $1,000 video it's silvery gray.  I would guess that this video is about five years old.  Shortly after Benny Hinn's repentance back in September, the same thing happened and Justin Peters called him a liar, but Benny said that he had a lot of older videos where he asked for $1,000 that would need to be removed from the servers and it would take time to find and remove them ",

And I told my staff, I said, you cannot put anything in the mail that I don't believe no more.  You can't put anything on.  this is your day that I don't believe anymore.  You cannot.  You will not.  And they're doing their best to make sure they go back in the history of the thousands and thousands of programs and tapes to remove things I don't want in there.  I don't want any next generation to see an old tape and say, oh, my Lord, look what he said there. ",
