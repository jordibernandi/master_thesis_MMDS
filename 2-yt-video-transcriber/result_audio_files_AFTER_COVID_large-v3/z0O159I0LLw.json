            "text": "Hi, I'm Dr.  Dave Janda.  Welcome back to Operation Freedom Briefings.  The goal of these briefings in my weekly radio show, Operation Freedom, is to provide you information.  the bought-off lamestream fake media will not present or will not touch.  Why?

You can join us on the radio show because we try to shed light on what the deep state is doing.  and how they're trying to strip you of your freedoms and liberties, and how to transform our country into a, well, a dark winter, a la Venezuela, a la China.

We hope we become part of our freedom family.  The title of today's presentation is, We the People and Sidney Powell, versus the deep state's dark winter.  Joe Biden spoke about the dark winter ahead.  What he was speaking about is he had a really good idea.  I've played that clip for you before about how he stated that he, as far back as Obama, had the best and most effective voter fraud organization in place.  He had Big Joe.  The big guy, as they used to call him in the Ukraine deals and the Russian deals, the China deals, the big guy had an idea, a good idea, that the election was going to be stolen from him.  And then comes the dark winter, the dark winter of communism.  If you look, and many historians have pointed this out, the way in which many communist leaders came into being and, quote, legitimized was through thrown elections.  Stalin said in his own words, and we've spoken about that before, but it bears repeating.  Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin, quote, I consider it completely unimportant who in the party will vote or how, but what is extraordinarily important is this, who will count the votes and how.  My mom, the history teacher, taught me many, many years ago that one of the primary foundations, if you will, bedrock of a free society are open and honest and free elections.  Even the most hard and progressive zealots out that window in the People's Republic of Ann Arbor have told me, there was something, there's something wrong with this election.  There's something not right.  I mean, these are people who still have impeached Bush signs on their lawns.  I kid you not.  They even have questions about the legitimacy of the election.  The head of the Federal Elections Commission, Treanor, said it himself that he felt that the election on November 3rd and 4th and ongoing was, in fact, illegitimate.  See, folks, we're in a war.  We're in a war for the future of our country.  And please, stay away from this left-right thing.  As I pointed out before, My experience starting in health care policy as far back as 1988 is that there's one political party in Washington, the Republicans.  They're all owned and operated by the same criminal syndicate.  And that's really coming to the forefront now.  We're in a war.  We're in a war for not right versus left.  But as Ronald Reagan pointed out to all of us, it's a war that's based on not an x-axis of right versus left, but up versus down.  Freedom versus oppression.  Free markets, capitalism versus totalitarianism and communism.  That's what this is all about.  And in fact, this is now, with the election, a two-front war.  As we have pointed out time and time again, when it comes to this election and the stealing of this election, not just against Donald Trump, but there were many Senate candidates and House of Representative candidates and State House And state Senate candidates who got caught up in this fraud.  Here in Michigan, John James running for Senate.  He got taken down in the fraud.  He's asked for not only a recount, but an audit of the votes.  And well, he should.  Because it truly was fraud.  And as we have pointed out, this was a multi... Now, this is really important.  multi-level, multi-faceted, coordinated criminal vote fraud operation.  And yes, as we have pointed out, COVID was used to change election laws, mail-in voting, mail-in, right?  Without signatures, without... COVID was used to change election laws as a setup to steal the election.  They're gonna want you to believe that this was just a glitch, and we've done that video.  Watch it from last week.  It's more than just a glitch, right?  It's more than just a glitch.  So they had their COVID run up into the election to institute the mail-in voting.  And then we had, as we've pointed out before, the fake polls and the fake endorsements by former intelligence officials, CIA directors, who are telling you that Joe Biden is the guy for you.  Yeah, right.  You're gonna believe anyone in the CIA?  Best of luck.  And as we pointed out from before the election, It was going to show that Donald Trump won the election.  Just look at the numbers up until midnight.  But then as we pointed out, and I take you back to the interview we did two days before the election with General Tom McInerney, who came on Operation Freedom on our radio show and said how the deep state was going to steal the elections.  Multifaceted.  Multilevel.  Look, I grew up in the city.  I grew up in Chicago, right?  I grew up in the suburbs of Chicago and a lot of family on the south side, spent a lot of time on the south side on the streets.  And, you know, you talk about throwing an election, Mayor Richard J. Daley, wow, he was the king of it.  But he, he would be absolutely awestruck in how this was done.  Because you have the dead voting.  You know, I mean, Biden got 100% of the graveyard vote.  It's the only demographic he did well with when the facts come out.  He had the dead vote.  He had the fake mail-in votes, the ballot stuffing votes.  But there was another side.  See, that's one front of this war.  And we have to be cognizant of both fronts.  But the second front was the electronic front.  And that's not conspiracy theory.  It might be conspiracy, but it's conspiracy reality, in fact.  And it's going to be proven in court, not some schmo on cable television on Fox.  It's not going to be proven there.  It can't.  It has to be proven in a court of law, because if you go to the media first with this, you compromise your sources and your methods.  And you make that evidence potentially inadmissible in a court of law.  And then these criminals get a pass on a technicality.  That ain't going to happen.  Sidney Powell isn't going to let that happen.  This was a multi-level, multi-faceted, coordinated criminal vote fraud operation.  And this is a war, a war on several fronts.  Just as World War II, we had the European theater and we had the theater in the Pacific.  MacArthur kind of ran the show over there in the Pacific.  And Omar Bradley and George Patton ran the show in Europe.  When you're in a multi-faceted, two-front war, MacArthur isn't running the Pacific and Europe.  And the reason why I bring this up is there's this, oh, The other night, there was an announcement that Sidney Powell isn't going to be working on what happened with the election.  What?  Rudy Giuliani and that team is running the Paper ballot, vote fraud, dead vote, absentee problems, mail-in voting problems.  That's one part of this war.  That's one front.  But the other front is the electronic side.  And we're going to talk about that.  We're going to talk about that in a minute.  You know, one of Sidney Powell's associates, Molly McCann, who's a brilliant lawyer, when it started to blow up Sunday night, I started to hear about it.  And the deep state was right on it, right?  Anyone, you know, look at their Twitter feeds, look at their Facebook accounts, look at what they're putting in the press.  Anyone who characterized this as, oh, this is horrible.  This is terrible.  Sidney Powell was fired.  You got to be hired before you're fired.  Sidney Powell was never hired by Trump or the RNC or the campaigns.  She had volunteered her services to work on the electronic stealing front.  Molly McCann wrote a great article, and we're going to get to it later in this presentation, but it was entitled, Democrats Do Drama, We Need to Stay Resolved, Disciplined, and Driven.  And General Flynn retweeted that article.  In the coming days and weeks, whether it's on the front led by Rudy Giuliani or the front opposition led by Sidney Powell on the electronic side, you're going to hear a lot of chain of custody of the votes.  That is really, really important.  What happened when someone went into a voter's booth and made their vote?  and how did that vote make its way to the tallies?  How can we confirm that there was no funny business, manipulation done on that paper ballot?  or as that paper ballot was sent across the electronic superhighway known as the internet, how do we know that that vote was not changed?  And when you hear chain of custody of the votes, that is what they're speaking about.  And that is what is so critical.  On the one front, as it relates to the dead people vote, the absentee vote, the mail-in vote, the stuffing of the ballot box vote, and on the front, as it relates to the electronic side of the votes.  An author by the name of Pat Scopoletti wrote the following, and it's actually interesting.  Excellent.  It's brief.  He said, by herself alone, Sidney Powell is telling us that our American election of 2020 was stolen by the exact methods of Hugo Chavez takeover of Venezuela.  If you want a communist America with a K, allow this travesty of an election.  Stolen elections are the greatest power of communism.  That's the 2020 version of what Stalin said.  Quote, I consider it completely unimportant who in the party will vote or how, but what is extraordinarily important is this, who will count the votes and how.  Let's go to Sunday night because there's a lot of confusion and I think there's a lot of of anxiety about what happened Sunday.  And first, let's go back to what my dad used to drill in my head from when I was a little kid on.  Panic is easy.  In times of trouble, panic is easy.  But a measured, rational approach is what is difficult in times of trouble.  In times of questioning, So let's talk about Sunday and what's transpired.  Okay.  It all started, I don't know what it was.  My radio show got done at 5.  I think it was probably closer to 5.45, 6 o'clock.  There was a release put out by the Trump campaign.  Trump campaign statement on legal team.  Quote, Sidney Powell is practicing law on her own.  She always has.  She is not a member of the Trump legal team.  She is also not a lawyer for the president in his personal capacity.  Rudy Giuliani, attorney for President Trump and Jenna Ellis, Trump campaign senior legal advisor and attorney for President Trump.  Well, Sidney was never hired by President Trump or the White House or the RNC or the Trump campaign.  She was a legal consultant that was donating her services and still is.  So let's go to what some people put out on Twitter.  after that came out.  There was a lot of people saying, oh, the sky is falling.  Oh, Sidney Powell was fired.  Oh, she wasn't fired.  You have to be hired before you're fired, as I said.  And she's still... working on the front, the electronic front.  General Flynn, and by the way, when this happened, Sidney Powell was blocked from Twitter.  So she could not respond on Twitter.  She was blocked.  I heard from Sidney and she said, I don't know why I was blocked, but I'm blocked on Twitter.  I cannot tweet.  And I think she was in Twitter jail for 12 hours.  I recently was in Twitter jail for 12 hours.  for tweeting on the election.  And they don't tell you.  All of a sudden, it just happens.  It's like, I'm trying to send a tweet.  Why can't I send a tweet?  The next thing you know, there's an, oh, you're, well, we're evaluating you on our community standards.  So you are, well, you can look at tweets, but you're not allowed to send any or, oh, lordy.  General Flynn posted the following on Twitter Sunday night.  Sidney Powell has been suspended for Twitter for 12 hours.  She understands the White House press release that I just read to you and agrees with it.  She is staying the course to prove the massive deliberate election fraud that robbed we the people of our votes for President Trump and other Republican candidates.  Lin Wood, who also has donated his services to on this election fraud to we the people.  He's the attorney who's been filing a number of lawsuits on his own as it relates to this fraud.  He's been very big in what's been happening in Georgia.  Lin Wood said, Sidney Powell and I are more alike than we are different.  We're fighting different legal battles for the same clients, we the people.  The people voted overwhelmingly to reelect Donald Trump.  All interests are aligned.  Fight back. ",
