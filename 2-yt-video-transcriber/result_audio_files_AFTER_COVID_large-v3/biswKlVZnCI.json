            "text": "Is everything okay over here guys?  That was ignorant.  You got lift?  Why'd you roll the window up on your friend like that?  That's not nice.  You guys are supposed to be a team.  He rolled the window up on you, sir.  Are you going to let him do that to you?  I guess so.  Yeah, he rolled the window up on his friend.  They're looking on the computer.  I'm in zoom everybody, so please forgive me for any little bit of shakiness.  He's a little upset, and then this guy's, oh my god.  Oh my god, let's get his face.  27.08.  We have 27.07 here.  And I guess they pulled over the Subaru Forester.  I don't know what the deal was with that yet.  I haven't gotten to the crux of it.  So this vehicle is unoccupied.  So I guess they're hanging out.  I guess it's these two hanging out in that vehicle right here.  And shoot, I'm leaving.  I'm leaving.  So this is the last one of the day.  He rolled his window up on his friend.  Did he?  Yep.  I don't know where that up.  He's coming back.  Here he is.  Are they harassing you, sir?  Are you guys okay?  All right, good.  Seaside Park.  Well guys, we found that the officers in Seaside Heights, New Jersey, are actually a lot from there.  Seaside Park is kind of like Philadelphia PD.  And they don't really talk at all.  They just ignore you.  Which is smart on their behalf because whenever a police officer talks to you, they usually say something stupid.  Seaside Heights likes coming up to the camera and saying things that are stupid.  So there's a vast difference between the two towns which border each other.  I'm gonna get your face.  I'm gonna get your mask.  Your mask face.  I'm gonna get it.  I'm gonna get it.  Trust and believe.  Stop hiding.  Security!  So Seaside Park and Seaside Heights kind of border each other.  They're right next to each other.  We're kind of on the cusp of where they go in.  He's walking up with hopefully not a citation.  I didn't see a manila piece of paper.  Is this the female officer from earlier?  Yes, that's her.  I just, I just, it's so exciting.  Don't you have a state-funded hotel room to go live in?  I love you, bro.  I'm going to throw the love bombs at you.  I am.  I love you.  Bless your heart and soul, bro.  I'm with you.  I'm going to throw the love bombs at you.  Do you know where to find any?  Do you know where to find it?  God darn it.  Don't mention it if you don't know where to find it.  Sit straight up.  I'm not here for no protest.  No, I wasn't.  Nope, nope, nope.  No, you didn't.  I'm not with them.  I'm with a whole different type of crew.  I just want to make sure they don't get their ass beat by the cops.  Are you sure?  You watch that?  I bet you I can find something.  They don't put their hands on no one in Seaside.  This ain't New York.  This is Seaside.  This guy thinks I'm a crackhead.  I like it though.  It's pretty funny.  Seaside of the best cops will take care of you.  They don't kick your back in.  Call it that.  Alright, so that guy got let go.  I don't know if it's a citation or not.  I didn't see him in a little piece of paper, so it might have been just a warning for something.  You guys don't see the camera as a threat, do you?  I didn't see him in a little piece of paper, so I don't think they gave him a ticket.  I think they may have just given a warning for something.  Let's go this way.  Do you guys know what happened with that guy?  No, we have no idea.  I mean, I don't hate you guys or nothing.  I'm just here to just observe things and stuff.  You know, everybody's interested nowadays.  Yeah, we have no idea.  I didn't see a manila piece of paper, so I don't think he got a ticket.  I'm hoping that, you know, the guy just gave him a warning for something stupid, you know?  Yeah, I know.  I wish I could tell you, but, you know, we only hear basically what you guys hear, and that's it.  If we're not in a computer, that's all.  It doesn't go over your radio, the Kenwood radio that you have?  No, it doesn't ever go into the radio.  Have a good day, guys.  So wait, so you guys just show up to things blind?  You guys don't know if it's an officer safety issue or anything before you arrive to them?  I don't hate you guys, bro.  I just want to observe and learn more about you.  That's all.  I'm not with all that stuff that happened today.  I saw this guy earlier here.  2709 unit.  Everything okay, ma'am?  You're such a fucking little bitch.  Why are you mad?  What are you, videotaping cops?  Yeah, we like to document.  Why, so they can do their own job?  Why are you approaching us?  Because you're fucking harassing them.  No, we're not.  You're not letting them do their fucking job.  No, we're not.  No one is harassing anyone.  You fucking film one more person, I'm going to beat the fuck out of you.  Back it off.  Shut up.  Shut up.  I ain't afraid of you.  I don't give a fuck if you are or not.  Well, move on.  You ready?  Move on.  Move on?  Why are you filming people?  Are you a woman beater?  I love being a woman.  You love being a woman, huh?  You filming that?  Give me that fucking phone.  Get the fuck out of here.  Move on.  Shut up.  Shut up, you little fuck.  Get the hell out of here.  Move.  Give me that fucking phone.  No.  Move it!  You little fucking... You guys are fucking garbage.  You're nothing but garbage.  I'm not afraid of you.  I don't give a fuck.  I'm not afraid of you.  You shouldn't be afraid of me.  You're nothing but fucking garbage.  And you, you should be ashamed of yourself, you little fuck.  I just want to see what my public servants do for a living.  Fuck your public servants, you fucking little faggot.  Go get a fucking job.  That's not nice.  That's not nice.  Shut the fuck up.  Stand there with your cigarette on your hip, you fat little fucking... Walk in shame, walk in shame.  Walk in shame would be fucking you and walking home, you pig.  Walk in shame.  Shut up, you fucking cunt.  Oh, thank you for the... Get the fuck outta here.  Thank you for the compliment, I appreciate that.  Did you get that on?  Yep.  Got every single bit of it.  What the fuck is wrong with these people?  He just pulled you over for no reason at all.  I am... You'll be our next YouTube star.  YouTube star.  You caught me not backing down.  Hell yeah.  Yo, there she is again.  Hey, you might want to get those two, but I'm not a snitch.  All right, guys, so that's Seaside Park, Seaside Heights, because we're right on the cusp, so we don't know where they actually come from.  Yeah, they came out of nowhere.  I told you.  I told you that's why I wanted to walk around the block and keep my head on a swivel. ",
