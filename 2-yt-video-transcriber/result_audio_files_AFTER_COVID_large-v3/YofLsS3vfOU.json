When there was that footage that emerged of him going down that ramp where he looked all sort of hunched and vulnerable, that's a sort of an open goal for his detractors because he sort of looks kind of ridiculous and vulnerable and frail.  But in focusing on that, it's trivialising and banalising political debate, you're sort of being personal.  If you're sort of like, look at him chuffling down that ramp, you're acknowledging that the level that the political conversation is taking place on is sort of ridicule and sort of trivial conversation about a person's physical appearance, physical abilities, et cetera, et cetera.  So it's hard then to shift the focus to what's important.  Redistribution of power, redistribution of wealth, change in public institutions.  so they're a better reflection of the populations that they're supposed to cater for.  Suddenly these things are also trivialised.  I was fascinated by watching this rally, but the thing that I thought was significant, important, is that the way that he tackles the ridicule for going down that ramp slowly is funnier than anything anyone criticising him said.

            "text": "To be clear, I met Donald Trump once and spent some time with him, and I personally think the policies of Donald Trump are detrimental to ordinary American people.  I think he is another president that's interested primarily in the success of transnational corporations.  I think his particular brand of nationalism is sort of jingoistic and unhelpful and like anyone I was powerfully impacted emotionally by the kids in cages and his sort of inability to condemn obvious overt racist tropes.  However, what is problematic is that I believe that the mainstream media is being dismissive of Donald Trump, not acknowledging the many things that he does that are very very skillful, including his ability to engage in public discourse in a way that is personal, amusing, accessible and that's, I think, leaving democratic candidates and democratic ideas in the dust.  The other thing that's problematic is that there is no willingness to acknowledge that the preceding administration didn't meaningfully improve on other right-wing governments.  I'm old enough to remember when George W Bush was president, it's only eight years ago, ten years ago, I don't know, twelve years ago, he was demonized as a sort of like or vilified as a kind of like dopey daft oh shucks thigh slapping dimwit cowboy cokehead and i in fact joined in with that.  uh the mtv awards that i was hosting at that time.  now donald trump is a sort of a con on a continuum with that sort of pathway of sort of macho kind of Republican president, although of course he is a sort of an entity unto himself, a kind of demagogue, detached, individualistic, weird phenomena.  There are moments in this video that are sort of somewhat jaw-dropping, mostly when he riles up the crowd to condemn the mainstream media. ",

            "text": "But you know what?  It wasn't that long ago that saying that the media couldn't be trusted was a discourse that entirely belonged to the left.  You can't trust the mainstream media.  They're the shields of big business.  They're there to keep the public docile.  Noam Chomsky, who... But hardly right wing would say that the media is a pillar of establishment whose role is to keep the populace spellbound and distracted so that the interests of the powerful can continue uninterrupted beyond the reach of democratic process.  This is true whether Joe Biden is president, Obama is president or Trump is president.  Doesn't matter.  So I feel like the vitriol that's being directed at Trump is somehow disingenuous, because if it was sincere, you would have to extend it to Democratic candidates and Democratic presidents who are not sufficiently different from Trump to warrant exalted status.  A true opponent of Donald Trump, or indeed any centrist Democratic or Republican candidate, would be genuinely interested in redistributing the resources of America, reevaluating the institutions and systems of American democracy, and creating a fairer society where ordinary people have purchase and impact on the decisions and power that controls their own lives.  Nobody's interested in that conversation.  What I think people are interested in is having a more diplomatic, superficially attractive president so that people that are in positions of relative privilege can continue to live their lives feeling like, well, look, we've done something.  We've dealt with Donald Trump.  Without ever acknowledging that the reason Trump is able to galvanise people is because he's a good public speaker who's... able to have the kind of conversations that the mainstream media are facilitating, i.e.  personal, trivial, banal attacks.  For me, the solution would be to focus solely on policies, ideas and changes that would improve the lives of ordinary Americans instead of engaging in this territory of mudslinging and personal attacks.

If you were to watch Joe Biden in a similar situation, I don't think it would be as interesting.  Furthermore, Joe Biden's been in government for eight years as vice president under Obama.  And under Obama, we... you know, drone strikes, Ferguson.  It wasn't like everything was cool.  We had everything straight.  We'd sort it out.  We had an equal society.  But whether you're talking about Cornell or Cornell West, any sort of left-wing American academics, no one thinks that the Obama administration delivered.  Most people prefer Barack Obama, or a significant number of people, prefer Barack Obama as a statesman, as a diplomat, as a person that you'd want to hang out with, seems charming and well-intentioned.  But when you look at that eight years of government compared to this four years of government, no doubt Donald Trump has instigated and presided over policies that have been detrimental and I'm no fan of Donald Trump.  But what I'm saying is that the nature of these attacks is not addressing the core problem, neither is it acknowledging the populist appeal that he is continuing to demonstrate mastery of, and I would suggest, and I'm obviously not alone in suggesting this, because I think it's kind of borderline obvious, will probably lead him to electoral victory in November, in spite of the disruptions, brutality, chaos that we've seen in America in recent months.

Furthermore, when they're booing like that at the media, wow, that's some intense stuff.  I think that the issue is that any opponent of Donald Trump that has serious intention of displacing him or acknowledge this is that you're dealing with someone who knows how to play this game in a way that it's not been played before extremely well.  is galvanizing his support brilliantly, is a narrator of considerable skill, is able to engage in the games of derision that are being facilitated by sort of late-night talk shows,  etc.,  with aplomb.  And if you're interested in a different kind of politics, then I think it is prudent to acknowledge that Donald Trump has been created by inertia in the mainstream, centrism, and the democratic left's abandonment of the interests of underprivileged people across the board.  That's what creates Donald Trump.  And until that's addressed meaningfully, in all likelihood, they're going to be more Donald Trump. ",

The bit where he talks about calling up his missus and her sort of taking the piss out of him, saying that all of the news coverage was about you walking down that ramp.  Firstly, it appeals to his perspective as a kind of individualistic narcissist.  It means that he can attack them on a territory that they've created.  I seriously think that if you want to... exceed, supersede, overthrow Donald Trump.  Don't fight on the territory where he can directly respond to personal attacks because I think he's better at that than they are and so you're fighting him on his own turf.  You know, he's able to personally respond to personal attacks.  It would be much more difficult if the debate became about the social, political, economic reality of America.  It would also be a lot easier if there was a political movement that was interested in real change.  I wonder if the Democrats, for example, will meaningfully back the Black Lives Matter campaign.  If they'll be able to... convey the significance of the intentions of that movement in a manner that Trump supporters would recognise is also beneficial to them.  That everyone benefits from a fairer, more democratic society.  Everyone benefits from a society where the most vulnerable have more access to power.  and that it has been a continued game of mainstream politics to pit people on the lower rungs of the social and economic ladders against one another on the basis of religion or class or colour, when in fact the people on those rungs have much more in common with one another than they have with people on the top rungs of those ladders.  But the reality is that whether you vote for Democrat or Republican, You're voting for the interests of powerful people.  There is some variation.  There are some cosmetic differences, but they are not significant enough.  And if you are interested in a different type of government, then you need a different kind of discourse, different kind of policies, different kind of politicians, and a very different approach to Donald Trump.  If this is the game that's going to be played in the build-up to the next election, he will win it. ",
