            "text": "yup okay.  So as you saw, that was a clear case of racial profiling.  He didn't like her in his neighborhood.  He said, it's too many people.  It's not too many people in that neighborhood.  Just say you don't like black people in the neighborhood.  And, and they are in, this is that we like to say, you know, this Mzungu privilege, but they feel deputized to do whatever they want to do because the society has told them they are deputized to do whatever you want to do.  This is why, you know, you have this changing of society and Trump and his ilk is just upset to watch this happening, but it gotta happen.  because we cannot go on another 95 years dealing with the way America is as we know it.  And you know, when I watched the message, you know, from the honorable minister to Louis Farrakhan and he was saying about how this country would never return to what it was and I've been feeling that and he said it and I'm like, you know what?  Yes, I agree with that a hundred percent because gone are the days, of them just getting away with the murder.  They've been doing the line, the pillaging, everything is on display.  And I liked the part where he said that it's going to be a price to be paid every time they do something to us.  And we have seen that every time they do something, they getting arrested.  Now losing jobs, even the police are getting arrested, losing jobs.  So much so that, you know, when sister Vicki did the video that, you know, union member in Atlanta was crying, crying the crocodile tears because he mad that he can't just abuse or his cops can't abuse black people no more like they used to and get away with it.  It's a new day in America and yes, we're going to keep on showing you and yes, that's what black media is supposed to do.  You know, some people say, Oh, well that's all you guys going to do is talk and show video.  You doggone right.  That's what media outlets do.  is many parts to the black community.  Understand that if you feel there's something else that needs to be done outside of media, then in the words of Rasputia from Norbert, you do it because that means that obviously you feel that in your heart that you need to do air.  All hands need to be on deck anyway.  Contribute something to the black community.  Media is warfare and media is powerful.  That's why these people spend billions of dollars on media.  And this is why it is a fight.  When you're doing media, you fighting every day because these people want to make sure to recapture the hearts and minds and make you submit to this kind of treatment.  because you know, they used to black folks saying, well, you know, it's just the way it is.  No, that's not the way it is.  It's not.  We is gone other days.  We say that's just the way it is.  You know, that's how these people are.  No, we're not gonna put up with that.  The reason why this has been going on so long because we haven't stood up against it and now we're taking the stand against it once and for all and say, you know what?  No more of this.  You leave us alone.  Go bother whoever you gonna bother, but you're not gonna bother us.  It's not gonna be tolerated.  Now this guy had, you know, got a disorderly conduct charge.  Because he did this not only to this young sister, but he did this to other people as well.  I think he should have got some stalking personally because he was stalking that young woman.  That's not disorderly conduct.  So see, they even still covering for him.  And then she should find a way to sue him in civil court as well.  But leave me a comment.  Let me know what you think about the situation in this story.  But like I said, just make sure you keep your eyes open all the time.  You know, these people, you know, I said, they mad.  right now, brothers and sisters, they are angry.  Trust me, the whole world starting to flip upside down and they know it and they don't know what to do. ",
