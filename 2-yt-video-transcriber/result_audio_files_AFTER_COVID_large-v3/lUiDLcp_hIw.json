            "text": "I don't know, doctor, I've never tried therapy before, let alone over Zoom or whatever, but I just have really been going through a rough time with this pandemic.  You know, and I know you're not a shrink, but I just didn't know who else to go to.  I mean, my country is a mess.  I'm not even talking to it right now.  I haven't had a haircut in like five months.  I mean, I know I still look great.  Thank you.  But I just feel there's no leadership.  And, you know, the president is even attacking you.  Can't you stop him?  I don't have the qualifications to do that.  I can only give people advice from the standpoint of public health.  Deep.  Darling, Dr.  Fauci, we know you're smart as hell.  You're certainly no slouchy.  You made it through Cornell.  You fought some bad infections.  But now you've hit a wall with the worst infection of them all.  Gee, Anthony Fauci, so calm and precise.  Your raspy voice is sexy and your classes are nice.  You follow the science on facts.  You're a lie.  You only want us not to die.  What a guy.  What a guy, what a guy, what a lovely guy, like he only wants us not to die.  Dr.  Fauci's made some mistakes.  Sir, COVID cases continue to rise.  Why would your administration try to discredit the nation's leading expert on infectious diseases?  It is what it is.  Dear Donald, you're satanic.  You should have stayed in Queens while we're in full on panic.  You're hocking frigging beans.  The doctors try to save us, but you push them away.  Wear your mask and just shut up, okay?  Hey, Anthony Fauci, he's dragging us out.  Forget the mask, just slap some masking tape on his mouth.  While you help protect us, he prays it'll pass.  He only covers his own ass.  His fat ass.  His own ass.  His own ass.  His own big fat ass.  All he tries to save is his own ass.  Ivanka Trump finding herself accused of violating federal ethics laws.  She shared a photo endorsing Goya.  Vanka, take your Goya and blow it out your can.  I know this might annoy you, but we ain't got a plan.  Your daddy wants to kill us.  Your husband's even worse.  Help me, Vanka.  Quick, design a purse.  Anthony Fauci, their strategy sucks.  They slander all the experts and promote all the schmucks.  And still some are buying the garbage they sell.  Please save us, Fauci.  We're in hell.  We're in hell.  The science should not stand in the way of this.  Our schools are extremely important, they're essential, and they must reopen.  Yes.  Hey, Kaylee, you're a dipstick, and please don't take offense.  Have you been eating lipstick?  You're making zero sense.  You're pushing propaganda.  You're acting like a snob.  Love your hair, girl.  Do your freaking job.  Hey, Santhony Fauci, we're all at a loss.  We can't rely on Barbie and Cruella DeVos.  He's winding them up and they're playing his tunes.  They're all unethical buffoons.  They're buffoons.  They're buffoons.  They're buffoons.  They're all shameless goons.  They're defrayed unethical buffoons.  In a way, we're creating trouble.  The trouble is this lady.  The trouble is he's mean.  The trouble is he's shady.  The trouble is this queen.  The trouble is she's useless.  The trouble's there's no plan.  Copper Fauci, you're the one we stand for.  Anthony Fauci, we're down on our knees.  Hey, girl.  Because no one at the top can help us stop this disease.  Please, Anthony Fauci, he hasn't a clue.  Thank you very much.  We love you.  You probably think I'm crazy.  I'm convinced of that. ",
