I was on my way out, and he started quoting Bible verses at me.  And I brought him, you know, some things that didn't make sense to me.  And he said, well, you know, that's just for God to know, and you'll find out after you die.  and he said but what you have to remember is that it's divinely inspired.  and I looked at him and I said well but that's what we're arguing about.  I don't think it's divinely inspired.  and so if I don't think it's divinely inspired then it doesn't really have the effect that I think you're thinking it has because we don't hold it in that regard.  and And if we're not holding it in that regard, then, well, then you're casting your pearls before swine.
