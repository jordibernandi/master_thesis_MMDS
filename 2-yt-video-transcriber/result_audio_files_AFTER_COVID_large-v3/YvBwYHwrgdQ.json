            "text": "What's up, you guys?  You know, one of my favorite things about the internet is that it's easy to be anonymous.  You can just hop online right now if you're not already online and say pretty much whatever you want in almost total anonymity.  Nobody will know it's you.  Probably won't be any consequences unless you did something stupid illegal.  This is how the controversial group Anonymous got started back in the day.  They've attempted to take on powerful entities to varying degrees of success.  But the idea of allowing people to operate behind a curtain is a little unnerving.  Some people have argued that anonymity makes it easier for bad actors to, you know, spread hate online or to organize crimes.  In my sex ed days, I often heard people argue that a lot of the trolling and bad behavior online would probably go away if everyone was just forced to use their real name.  But would it really?  On today's indirect message, the right to remain anonymous.  The good, the bad, and the ugly.  Last week, Scott Alexander became a target of the New York Times.  It started out on a high note.  The paper is writing an article about his blog, Slate Star Codex.  I'd describe his blog as a sort of skeptical, rationalist approach to philosophy, politics, science.  Worth noting, Scott's a psychiatrist.  Also worth noting, Scott isn't his real name.  So after being interviewed, the New York Times says to him, hey, look, we know your real name and we're going to include it in the article.  The paper insists that real names are policy, likely as a matter of public interest.  Faced with being doxxed by the biggest paper in the country, he decided to delete his whole blog.  He didn't want to record audio, so we had a little chat over email. ",

I think it's plausible that if I became a national news figure under my real name, my patients, who run the gamut from far left to far right, wouldn't be able to engage with me in a normal therapeutic way.  The second reason is more prosaic.  Some people want to kill me or ruin my life, and I'd prefer not to make it too easy.  I've never been shy about any of the things that people might want to know about me.  My age, my profession, where I live.  All that knowing my real name would add would be how to find my house and how to get me fired.  I don't see why either of those two things are in the public interest.  On the other hand, I think it's hugely in the public interest for people to be able to write blogs without worrying about their jobs or their safety. ",

It certainly has some pretty strong opinions about gender roles.  Is supporting Trump racist?  I would rather say that if someone has bad opinions, you argue with them or block them.

            "text": "Scott's story underscores a few reasons why anonymity is really important.  For one, most of us occupy multiple social identities.  You probably don't behave the same with your friends as with your romantic partner as with your parents.  At least I hope not.  The other reason that anonymity is important, which is actually a bigger reason in my opinion, is that we need to be able to express our ideas freely in order to challenge authority and dogma.  Anonymity enables the pursuit of truth.  It's why we protect whistleblowers and why researchers will collect sensitive data anonymously.  And around the world, anonymity is critical to fighting government corruption without being killed or jailed, which is precisely why oppressive regimes are trying to take anonymity away.  China is a particularly egregious example.  The Chinese government operates one of the largest internet censorship regimes in the world.  Since 2017, anonymity isn't allowed there.  Everyone has to have their real identity verified before they can use social media.  And the government claims that this is to fight fake news.  Sound familiar?  But it's part of a broader pattern of China controlling the flow of information and punishing dissidents who speak out against the Communist Party.  At least 2 million people are employed by the Chinese government to scour the internet looking for information that needs adjusted or removed.  This is not the thing of dystopian sci-fi movies, right?  This is real life.  And American tech giants have often been complicit in all of this.  Just a couple of weeks ago, Zoom terminated the accounts of three Chinese activists who were using the platform to organize.  Why?  Because the government asked them to.  I mean, come on, Zoom, grow some balls.  Now here in the US, our right to anonymity has been protected by a few Supreme Court cases, but that does not mean that we're home free.  For instance, Facebook itself has a policy requiring real names.  Now imagine a world where most people get their news from Facebook, and it's one of the main ways that people can discuss what's happening in the country.  Imagine that that country's government is hostile to people who criticize it.  This hypothetical is not a huge stretch, just a little stretch.  But what about online harassment?  Doxers and swatters and trolls?  Should they really be able to hide behind a screen name?  In the popular imagination, an internet troll hides behind an anonymous screen name while they wreak havoc on the internet from a dingy basement.  So this is why people say, hey, you know, if we take away the anonymity, then the behavior's going to go away.  But there is an elephant-sized assumption in that argument, which is that it's the anonymity that causes bad behavior.  If that were true, we should see less toxicity in online environments where people's real names are attached.  But... We don't.  So what's going on here?  Researchers think something that may be playing a big role in bad behavior online is that when we're anonymous, we're more likely to conform.  Which means if I'm on a trolly internet forum where everyone's being a dick, well, I'm more likely to be a dick too.  But if I'm in a community that expects respectful conversation, well, I'm more likely to be respectful too.  This effect is known as deindividuation.  It's a psychological phenomenon where the norms of a group we're in overrides our individual sensibilities.  And the effect gets worse when there's a clearly defined outgroup.  So, you know, one group's fans versus another group's fans or liberals versus conservatives.  Unsurprisingly, it plays a role in mob mentalities and groupthink.  Which means we have to think about the environment that all of this stuff is happening in, which is a lot more complicated.  So this is why some researchers are now saying we need to think about trolling and bad internet stuff not as an anonymity problem, but as a self-control problem.  we can take a couple of things away from this.  alternatives to getting rid of anonymity.  one is to encourage social media platforms to build in tools that help us to get a grip when we are having self-control issues.  the other thing that we can do is because there is a conformity element at play here is we can model the type of behavior that we want to see in our online communities and try to cultivate that as a group.
