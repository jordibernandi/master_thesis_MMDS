            "text": "Hi folks, I'm Steve Hindy with Showing Animals Respect and Kindness.  We've already posted a couple videos exposing the unbelievable corruption of Kentucky's Clay County Sheriff's Office, whose deputies actively protect horrifically cruel and illegal cockfights.  To update this issue, no higher authority has dealt with Sheriff Patrick Robinson so far, but we're going to stay on top of this, so stay tuned.  Today, we'll move to McCreary County, Kentucky, where cockfights are protected by not only the McCreary County Sheriff's Office, but even more disturbingly, they're protected by the Kentucky State Police.  Come on, folks.  Time to expose more crooked cops.  On June 20, 2020, shark investigators acted on a tip about a cockfight at 303 Low Gap Road outside Pine Knot, Kentucky.  A shark drone found the cockfighting location and the McCreary County Sheriff's Office was called.  The Sheriff's Office is located about 10 minutes from Pine Knot, but the sheriff wouldn't respond, wouldn't even pick up the phone, and never responded to the message left regarding an active cockfight.  This utter lack of action is almost funny, given the sheriff's last campaign video.  2015, when I was elected as sheriff, I promised the people in Macquarie County that I'd work 24-7, I'd have 24-7 coverage, that we'd answer all calls in a timely manner, and we'd work hard on the drug problem.  McCreary County Sheriff Randy Waters is apparently just as corrupt as Clay County's Sheriff Robinson.  Next, we called the state police, and in a very timely manner, we saw two state police cruisers headed toward the cockfight property at speed.  But what happened next was something we never saw coming.  A hidden camera picked up the cruisers as they pulled into the drive.  The cockfighters were trapped.  Suddenly, the cruisers stopped.  Then they reversed, pulling back far enough to create an escape route at the front of the drive.  Next, a cockfighter's car was allowed to escape the property.  Then another.  And another.  and then a stream.  33 cars were given a get-out-of-jail-free card by the Kentucky State Police on that day.  One of those vehicles was towing an unlicensed trailer.  Trailers like this are used to carry fighting roosters, and a trailer that size can obviously hold dozens and dozens of them.  But the state police just let this unlicensed trailer pass right by them.  Only after allowing a majority of the suspects to leave did the officers go onto the property.  What kind of law enforcement operation is this?  The state police were only on site for seven minutes, and then they simply left.  A seven-minute investigation.  We were stunned.  We confronted the state police by phone, and things got even weirder.  State police trooper Jason Browning basically said that nothing was happening.  We pulled up there.  We walked in.  I talked to several people and didn't even see a chicken.  There was actually no fight going on or anything like that.  I did not see anything illegal as far as cruelty to animals or gambling or drug dealing or anything like that.  At no time did Trooper Browning mention that he and his fellow trooper allowed 33 vehicles to leave the property, including an unlicensed trailer.  When I heard this, I had to call Trooper Browning because I knew that there was a major flaw in his claim that there was no sign of roosters around.  No feathers, no nothing, huh?  I mean, yeah, there's feathers, there's... Feathers lying around.  So Trooper Browning admitted that there were feathers around, but there was more than feathers to be found.  Our drones filmed these cages of roosters being carried to vehicles on that property after the police left.  And you can bet there were plenty more birds around because they're kept in all those trailers on the property.  One thing we know about roosters is that they never shut up.  From the beginning of the day to the end, roosters are crowing.  That means that roosters in these cages were crowing while the police were there.  So claims that there was no sign of roosters is a blatant lie.  So what is going on?  I think the troopers were intent on doing their job when we saw them heading to the cockfighting property.  I think they received orders from someone above to stand down the moment they stopped on that drive into the property, and those orders were to allow the cockfighting criminals to go.  There's plenty more evidence to support that theory.  The following week we returned to the site and again our drone found lots of cars and another cockfight.  We used a larger drone with stronger magnification and caught cockfighters as they brought live birds into the building and brought dead or dying birds out.  We called the state police again, and again they responded, only this time they never went onto the property.  Incredibly, they appeared to actually be running security for the cockfighters.  They seemed more intent to keep us from interfering than anything else.  This time, the cockfighters did not flee the site.  Apparently, the word was out that the state police were the friends of these criminals.  For hours, our drone filmed, and we tried to get the state police to do their job.  We told them we had video evidence of live birds being brought in and dead birds being brought out, with weapons being removed from the dead birds' bodies, but nothing could get the state police to do their jobs.  That's when you know the fix is in.  That's when you know that even the state police are corrupt.  Welcome to the shit show that is Kentucky.  I don't believe that those young officers who were posted as security for the cockfighters were making their own decisions.  I think the state police, at the heart of this corruption, are farther up the food chain.  These guys were too young.  They were just following orders, I believe, and they didn't look too happy about what their orders were.  I think a week earlier, they were ready to go in, but then received orders from above.  That doesn't pardon their inaction in any way, but I think the real corruption is higher up in the state police, which is even more disturbing.  The following weekend, we were back at the Pine Knot site on the 4th of July.  This is supposed to be a big weekend for cockfighters, but the place was empty, as well as two other sites in Butler and Clay counties.  It took too long because the police wouldn't act, but our cameras and drones did finally succeed in shutting them down.  In both June and July, the McCreary Voice published articles by reporter Eugenia Jones about our efforts.  The story included comments from McCreary County Attorney Austin Price, who confirmed that cockfighting is illegal in Kentucky, just as it is throughout the rest of the country. ",

            "text": "That is a silly claim, but even if we indulge it for a moment, the state police could have stopped that unlicensed trailer that passed right in front of them.  One can only imagine how many fighting roosters they would have found inside.  This matter requires a comprehensive investigation, either by the state police internal review or an independent investigative group or the FBI or all of the above.  So far, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear has been completely unresponsive, both in McCreary County and in Clay County, where our investigators caught sheriff's deputies at the cockfight, but completely ignoring their duties as law enforcement officers.  So now we've implicated sheriffs in two counties, plus the state police, in the web of corruption that protects Kentucky cockfighters.  Unfortunately, we're not done yet.  In our next video, we'll expose another Kentucky sheriff in Butler County, so stay tuned.  In the meantime, please contact Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear and demand he take action to ensure enforcement of the laws against cockfighting and illegal gambling.  If you know about cockfighting locations anywhere in the  U.S.,  please let us know either by emailing us at tips at sharkonline.org or by calling us at 630-385-0244.  I'm Steve Hindy with Showing Animals Respect and Kindness and we are going to crush cockfighting. ",
