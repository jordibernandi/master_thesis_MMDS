            "text": "Welcome everyone, this is your host Sean with Blue Ridge Silverhound and today we got a good one here for you.  Today we're going to talk about the 1958 Lincoln Wheat Scent slash Penny.  And this, as you guys know, is the final year of the wheat back design for what has been one of the most widely collected coins in coin collecting history for the most part in U.S.  coins.  so these coins here uh were produced heavily.  uh in total there was over a billion 1958 Lincoln Wheat Pennies produced by both the Philadelphia and the Denver Mints respectively.  And we are going to talk about it.  Most importantly, this is a coin that probably you have come across in change at some point, or perhaps, you know, if you're an avid coin roll hunter, the 1958 date is one of the most common coins that you'll pull out of your change or out of them rolls.  and uh i'm happy to say there's a few things that this coin has going for it that you need to know about.  all right not just about the coin itself and the grade and all that but all the other intangibles we're going to get right into it.  you never know you might have a really valuable and rare pocket change piece.  you just don't know about it.  uh why spend the next hundred dollar coin or thousand dollar coin when you can learn all about it here on blue ridge silverhound?  so with that being said this is your first time here.  welcome like share subscribe.  go ahead and hit that bell for instant notifications if you enjoyed today's video and you want more of it.  uh like a pringles chip you can't stop but just one right.  uh we have a lot of binge watchers on the channel so uh why can't you be one of them?  anyways we're gonna jump into the first coin.  and uh The 1958P Lincoln Cent, we're going to be talking about both business strikes.  There is a 1958 proof strike, which will not come up in the conversation except for when I'm talking about it right this second, because those were produced and made for the collectibles market.  Those were sold direct from the U.S.  Mint.  The 1958 P, as you can see, and I got my mouse pointer for you guys to kind of draw your attention to a certain point or area on the coin.  that's important.  Usually on these coins, the mint mark will be right under the date.  But for the longest time, Philadelphia minted examples exhibit no mint marks whatsoever.  So you're not going to see a physical letter P on these coins.  So this one right here is the Philadelphia struck coin.  It's the lowest minted coin out of the two, albeit there's still a lot of them out there.  252,525,000 total pieces were made by the Philadelphia Mint Facility.  Quite a bit, quite a bit, but pales into comparison to the Denver Minted Cousin, which we will talk about here in a moment.  Now the coin on its face, if you found one of these in change, and you know, it's brown, it's circulated, there's not much to it, then it has a minimum value of about four to five cents.  Okay, so it's worth five times face.  You can't retire off of it, but that is the absolute minimum that the coin will be worth.  It'll be worth a nickel.  Now, when you come across a coin that you see like what you have on screen here, it's nice, freshly minted, looks like it just came out of the mint yesterday, then we're going to be talking about coins that are going to be worth a lot of money.  Now, the example that you see here is a 58P.  It's a PCGS Mint State 67 Plus full red.  That's what you see here on this slab designation.  Now, we have these third-party graders, okay?  NGC, PCGS, which is, you know, they're usually the bell cow when it comes to grading, along with a few others.  Annex and ICG also come to mind.  So what people do is they go and they take the highest graded raw specimens.  That means they're not graded yet.  They send it off to these companies.  They pay the money.  You know, it could be $25, $30, $40, $50, whatever the amount of fees it costs to send these out for grading in the hopes that it will come out at the highest grade level.  The highest grade level equates to a lot of money.  So for the 58P Lincoln scent that you see here, okay, keep in mind, grading does cost money.  it costs a lot of money.  usually you can't send one coin expecting for it to come back at the grade level that you expect.  all right grading is a very subjective thing.  so you know your opinion and my opinion and the grader's opinion are going to be three different opinions.  So you want to make sure that if you wanted to submit these coins that not only do you submit the highest graded specimens out of your group, but you submit multiple examples.  That's why people go through what they call brilliant uncirculated rolls.  They buy full BU rolls in the secondary market.  They go through them, they cherry pick the nicest examples, and then they go ahead and send it off to the graders.  Now, for the 58 Philadelphia, the highest assigned grade value is a mid-state 67 plus full red.  Okay, that's pretty nice.  The highest grade is 70 when it comes to coin grading.  The highest recorded sale is going to be $9,000 for this one example that you see on screen.  It's a Mid-State 67 Plus full red.  It was graded by PCGS, and it sold October 24th.  of 2019. all right.  so that is the most extreme example.  there aren't a whole lot of these coins in existence.  uh at the highest grade there are only four that have been assigned.  that 67 plus full red all right.  so the second business strike coin is going to be the 1958 d. now as you can see there is an actual physical d mint mark.  okay that means your coin was minted in denver.  Now the coin that you see on screen is a really nice high-grade example, but the Denver Mint Mart coin, there were tons of these that were produced.  Like I had mentioned, there was over three times as many produced for Denver as there was for Philadelphia.  800,953,300 total pieces were produced by the Denver Mint facility.  now if you're looking to getting the grading and you see the coin that you see on screen here as being a subject coin for what could be a future grading submission possibility then this might be for you okay.  so we got the 1958d lincoln wheat cent.  as always guys grading costs money.  all right each submission.  don't be surprised.  you spend two three four hundred dollars submitting a number of coins to PCGS.  it's not a cheap service but the rewards are high.  keep that in mind.  but you also have to have that discerning eye for perfection for quality.  you want to make sure your coins are spot-free as you submit these to the graders.  so much like the philadelphia minted coin that we saw previously.  the highest assigned grade is mint state 67 plus full red.  think of the plus designation as being the 67 and a half.  so it's a half a point grade higher.  so it's like right in the middle between 67 and 68.  There are no Mid-State 68s in existence.  As a matter of fact, at this grade level, the 67+, there are 21 examples at that assigned grade.  So the highest recorded sale is $3,360.  It's a PCGS Mid-State 67+, full red, and it sold January 14, 2019. through heritage auctions.  So, as far as the Philadelphia Endeavorment coins go, that pretty much sums up high-grade collecting, which is a popular thing these days.  You have these registry set participants that pay all the money in the world for the top-grade specimens.  Now, there is one known variety.  This is a huge, huge asterisk.  This is not going to be a coin that comes easily out there with enough searching.  And that's the 1958 Doubled Die Auverts.  I've talked about this coin on a previous video, probably about three years ago.  But as you can see, take a look at the auverts of the coin.  You have extreme doubling on Liberty and in the motto, In God We Trust.  This is a coin that has been quite the white whale for the longest time.  A lot of people know about it because of all the press it's received, especially on YouTube.  Not only myself, but a lot of my counterparts are talking about this coin.  Now, here's the thing.  Now, the reason why I say that there is a bold asterisk on this coin, there's a few things that need to come to mind.  Was this a mint mistake?  Did they only produce a couple of these, found out about the error or the variety, and then decide to scrap that set of dies and then start all fresh?  wasn't intentional?  did they intentionally make this error?  okay.  and then finally for a coin that exhibits this extreme doubling why isn't the date doubled as well?  usually you're going to see a little bit of doubling even if the center of rotation is on the date.  you're going to have some pretty nice doubling on there as well in spite of all the other doubling on the coin.  So there's a lot of question marks revolving this coin.  The one loan example that sold on the secondary market was through Stacks Bowers Auction Galleries.  This was a few years ago.  For $336,000, it's the coin that you see on screen.  It's a PCGS Mid-State 64, full red.  And yeah, this is, again, this is not a coin that's just going to all of a sudden pop up.  This one right here, there are three examples known that are graded and they're in pretty legitimate collections.  but are there?  is there a fourth example?  okay that really begs the question is this an evil?  a searchable type of variety remains to be seen?  i don't know but at least you know about it just in case.  Now in terms of errors, I have selected six notable errors that have sold in the recent past all through Heritage Auctions.  So all of the image credits go to Heritage.  So we're going to take a look at the notable 1958 Lincoln Wheat Penny error coins.  That maybe could be a possibility in your searches later on down the line, not only for 58, but all dates as well.  So earlier, later into the memorial stage of the design, you never know where you're going to come across these.  So the first coin I want to talk about is one that you see here.  This is a 1958 P. As you can see, it's all center struck by about 20 percent.  All right.  So these right here are going to appear a little bit bigger than your standard Lincoln cent because they're kind of stretched out a little bit.  They're going to be a little bit oblong.  This coin here is an NGC graded Mid-State 63.  Red brown example.  Looks like it's circulated a little bit.  And this one sold for $300.  Heritage Auctions, September 10th of 2019.  Pretty nice example.  Again, error coins in general.  All highly desired, very coveted.  You have a select group of error collectors.  It's actually a really large community of folks that collect US Mint error coins.  So this is the low end on the totem pole, but it sold for $300.  Pretty nice.  The next coin that we have here is another off-center struck coin.  However, this one is struck off-center by 60%.  Quite a large difference compared to the previous coin.  But the cool thing is it still has a fully legible date on there, which is kind of like one of the hot points to collecting off-center coinage is a full date.  If you're able to see and read a full date, that makes the coin more desirable.  uh in the uh the eye of public opinion i guess of error collectors.  so this is a tremendous example.  it's a pcgs mid-state 64 red brown and it sold for 312 dollars.  september 10th of 2019. this is a recent sale.  All right, so the next one we have here, this is an older sale.  Okay, so the scanned images provided by Heritage is a little bit fuzzier compared to what they normally do nowadays.  I mean, their quality has gotten a lot better.  But this is a 58P.  This one is struck on a 90% silver dime planchet.  All right, so this was intended... to be struck on a regular uh bronze planchet.  all right uh an errant silver planchet that was made for uh production of a roosevelt silver dime somehow made it into the hopper of other blank lincoln sent bronze planchets.  so this one right here is an annex mid-state 62. it's sold for a 805 dollars january 8th of 2010. so it's a 10 year old sale up.  this coin could be worth a lot more today.  It's hard to say.  And then we have like.  the last three coins on the list are very interesting.  They're like borderline, just like tantalizing, very, very incredible arrow coins.  But what we have here is the 1958 Lincoln cent that was struck on a Cuba centavo blank.  All right.  So a blank planchette intended for Cuban centavos.  You know, as a matter of fact, the u.s mint produced a lot of the coins for cuba back in the 50s.  so this explains a lot.  all right there's going to be a lot of like cross contamination of these planchets from one to the other.  this is an ngc mint state 65 example that you see here i mean the centavo coin for cuba is a little bit smaller than your standard lincoln cent planchet.  so you have a lot of design loss there.  This one sold for $1,527.50 December 4th of 2015.  Quite an interesting error.  And it is kind of silvery in color.  So it's going to look a little bit different.  It's going to appear a little bit smaller.  It's a strange coin.  A strange mint error.  So on the same vein, we have another coin.  coin here it's a 58. uh this one is struck on an improperly annealed cuba.  one cent planchet.  that's a mouthful one cent planchet.  so it weighs two and a half grams.  it's a little bit smaller than standard lincoln cent planchet.  uh and plus you have all these these peeling little bubbles.  okay that's the improper annealing.  uh so this coin has quite a bit of extra copper on the surface.  this was exposed to heat a lot longer and that's why you have the copper ions stuck to the surface of this coin and it's not sticky enough.  okay it's kind of flaky on there.  this is an ngc graded mid-state 63 full red example and it sold for 1740 december 7th of 2019 another recent sale couple months old.  And then finally, we are going to end it off on this bad boy.  This is an incredible coin.  And if you sit there and stare at it long enough, you're going to see a lot of neat kind of like crossover between one and the other.  It's a 1958 Lincoln that was overstruck.  it already struck 1958 Cuba Centavo.  okay.  so first thing that you're gonna see is the date is right here 1958. you could see some design details.  you could see something right here as well.  on the obverse of the coin I mean this coin has a lot going on for it.  this is this is an incredible kind of white whale Lincoln sent error that anyone would be happy to own and quite honestly i think it undersold.  you know price wise and this is a recent sale.  this is actually from last month.  i believe the florida fun show had this coin on exhibition during that sale last month.  But this one graded NGC Mid-State 64, and it sold for only $2,880.  $2,880.  I mean, in hindsight, it's a lot of money, but I felt like it's like, man, this could very well have been like... a five six seven thousand dollar coin just because it's so unique.  and uh it's incredible.  just the crossover of the overlap of the overstruck appeal of this error is just second to none.  all right i love this coin.  um And there you go.  That's the slab right there.  It's a great piece.  It's part of the emo collection.  That's strange.  Spelled differently, of course.  But anyways, that's going to wrap it up for the 1958 Lincoln Cent values.  Hopefully you guys got a little bit of information, a little takeaway from this particular episode.  If you found a 1958 Lincoln Cent, you never know.  Take a close look at it.  You might have something extraordinary.  And It was a pleasure talking with you guys today.
