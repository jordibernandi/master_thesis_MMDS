I'm done placating people who want to vilify the delicious beauty, all right?  No more of this.  We're not going to associate this with that, all right?  I don't want some Pavlovian response where people see this face and all of a sudden they think of penises.  That's malarkey.  That's malarkey of the highest order.  It's a blessed day.  When you learn things about Ben Shapino, you didn't already know.  Sorry, Ben Shapino.  Why do I have that name stuck in my head?  Cody Schody.  This is your fault.  By the way, Cody, love you.  Great show.  Keep doing it.  Keep doing what you're doing.  Anyways, Ben Shapiro.  We all knew for some time that the man was a consummate grifter.  Not in the sense that he doesn't believe everything he talks about.  I think he genuinely does believe a lot of the vile things he spews.  But more his success.  How is it that Ben Shapiro, of all people, seems to be so popular on the interwebs?  When I can't really find anyone beyond the median age of 97 who enjoys that kind of content, who really wants someone who's kind of condescending and talking down to them.  So for this bit, I have done a lot of Ben Shapiro takes, and I often like to get into this kind of zone where I do an imitation of Ben Shapiro.  The problem is with Ben Shapiro, if this gets to his eyes and ears and he does a response to me in some form... he likes to play the anti-Semitic card.  And just like Tree of Logic likes to play the anti-Semitic card as well, she doesn't happen to be one of the chosen people of Israel.  She's not Jewish herself.  So because she's not Jewish, I took a bit of umbrage to the fact that she was basically Jewish trying to speak for the Jewish people.  That was one of my problems.  I don't really think you're allowed to play the anti-Semitic card if you yourself don't really understand anti-Semitism and or the history of the persecution of the Jews themselves.  She does know about the Holocaust, which, congratulations, you're sentient in the 21st century, but can you speak about a lot of the other atrocities that have been happening?  I mean, historically, if there's one group that has been persecuted, it's the Jewish people.  The reason I bring all this up, by the way, is because when it comes to Ben Shapiro, I don't want an imitation of him to be characterized as me making fun of Jewish people.  I'm distinctly making fun of Ben Shapiro, and I do not think that my impersonation of Ben Shapiro is in any way a characterization of Jewish people as a whole.  That being said, I'm not going to do it, because clearly this is going to be taken out of context, something to that effect.  I'm going to let other people do it for me, okay?  So I think I found... Here's an imitation by a Jewish individual making fun of Ben Shapiro just to warm himself up. ",

            "text": "bravo.  that uh that gets a thumbs up from me.  that was good.  and now that i've gotten that out of the way let's talk a little bit about ben shapiro and the grift.  someone was asking what exactly is a grifter?  a grifter is someone who may or may not believe what they espouse.  so someone like dave rubin for example is the king of the grift as i like to say.  we even made a song about it.  uh myself and napoleon the legend and dave.  we came together.  we made a song about who is the king of the grifters someone who doesn't believe what they talk about.  so Here's the truth, everybody.  We're all hypocrites.  Every single one of you, myself included.  All right.  I love to talk about all these things like socialism and that we should have open borders and that we should help out people and all this kind of stuff.  I have an apartment and I have a couch in my apartment.  Have I opened up my couch to a refugee?  No, I have not.  Is the reason because I don't think that would be a good thing?  No, it is not.  But to some degree, there's a level of how much we can accomplish versus how much are we hypocrites.  That's kind of like, that's just the life, right?  All of us try to project, especially if you're a public figure, a better version of yourself and a better version of the world.  But at the same time, I drive a car.  I'm contributing to CO2.  I eat meat.  I'm a monstrous hypocrite when it comes to that.  And yes, my couch is not filled right now with a refugee who could probably use that couch more than anyone else, or even a homeless person in Vancouver.  My justification for that would probably be that the amount of, I guess, anxiety and mental stress that that entire activity would cause both me and my partner would not be... good for me and me trying to then do further work because I would be distracted and my ability to show something like that.  that that would be how I justified myself.  but anyways on to a certain extent all of us are hypocrites.  that being said Ben Shapiro spouses all this kind of conservative rhetoric.  do I think that makes him a grifter?  Whether or not he believes it, I think he does.  I'm going to be honest.  I don't think he's a grifter, okay?  I think he's genuinely in the know.  However, this was a great revelation today.  There's a dirty secret behind the extraordinary success of Ben Shapiro on Facebook.  The Daily Wire has an undisclosed relationship with Facebook pages owned by Mad World News, a notorious site that exploits Facebook algorithm with racism and violence.  Interesting?  Tell me more.  The success of The Daily Wire, the website run by right-wing pundit Ben Shapiro on Facebook, is mind-boggling.  The site itself is a small staff and is primarily aggregates content from Twitter and other news outlets.  Typically, it's articles that are very short, usually less than 500 words, and contain no original reporting.  And yet, last month, The Daily Wire was the seventh-ranked publisher on Facebook.  Obviously, appealing to that demographic out there, right?  Uh... According to Analytics Service News Whip, articles published in the Daily Wire attracted 60 million engagements.  Holy shit.  Engagement is a combination of shares, likes, comments, and is a way of quantifying distribution on Facebook.  The reach of the Daily Wire's article was equal to the New York Times and more than the Washington Post.  But what actually understates how well the Daily Wire does on Facebook, while the New York Times publishes 15,000 articles in May and the Washington Post publishes 8,000, the Daily Wire publishes 1,141.  On a per-article basis, the Daily Wire receives more distribution than any other major publisher, and it's not even close.  Wow.  I didn't even know this because, again, Facebook is just a decaying old platform used by old decaying... Oh no, the ageism is real right now.  What explains the Daily Wire phenomenal success on Facebook?  Popular information revealed part of the answer last October, but the full story is much darker.  Popular information was discovered by a network of large Facebook pages, each built by exploiting racial bias, religion, bigotry, and violence, and systematically promote content on the Daily Wire.  These pages, some of which have over 2 million followers, do not disclose a business relationship with the Daily Wire, but they all post content on the Daily Wire 10 times or more each day.  So there's someone who is just force-feeding all of your parents' Daily Wire content on the reg.  And you're wondering why your parents might be more conservative.  You're wondering why they might not vote for, say, even if they're liberals, they might not vote for someone like, I don't know, a Bernie Sanders.  And they might prefer a Joe Rogan.  That's because they spend all day on Facebook.  Get them off Facebook.  Save your parents.  Take them off Facebook.  It's the only way.  But anyways, the undisclosed relationship not only helps explain the Daily Wire's unlikely success on Facebook, but also appears to violate Facebook's rules.  How to convert bigotry and fear into shares and likes.  The network of large Facebook pages promoting The Daily Wire are all run by Corey and Christy People, who are best known as the creators of the Mad World News.  Facebook pages controlled by the Peoples include Mad World News, which has over 2 million followers, The New Resistance, which has over almost 3 million, The Right Stuff, 600,000, America First, and American Patriot.  The reach of these pages is massive.  Content posted on these five pages has generated more than 31 million engagements on Facebook over the last three months, according to CrowdTangle, an analytic service owned by Facebook.  To put it in perspective, the reach of the network over this time period exceeds that of the New York Times.  How did pages like Mad World and New Resistance grow so big?  They did so by exploiting racism, religious bigotry, and violence.  And this is important.  This is important both to understand why the alt-right and the far-right is doing so well on both the internet and in general in life because this kind of stuff leaves the screen, it jumps off the screen and permeates the real world.  So when your parents again are telling you conservative talking points and you're like, mom, why do you believe that?  What is wrong with you?  Like, well, yesterday on the Facebook, I saw a link that shows that apparently black people are all criminals.  There's this thing called the 1350 rule.  Have you heard of it?  I heard it from this academic.  He's a neuroscientist called Sam Harris.  And he told me the black people are genetically predisposed to committing crimes.  and that these Black Lives Matter activists are actually rioters.  and this shit is actually terrible.  And you're like, what, why?  And then you're like, mom, why are you going out and you're voting for these people?  What is going on?  Oh my God, the gray vote, the boomer vote is an enormous demographic.  They're voting in swaths and they're voting for centrists to right wingers.  This shit is important.  I'm very fucking serious about this.  Like jokes aside, bits aside, we have to find a way to combat this.  There has to be an equivalence.  So we have to weaponize the things that are working and use it in our favor.  So someone out there, it would make you not only a ton of money, by the way, these these these like enormous Facebook groups.  They make a shit ton of money.  I'm talking millions of dollars if you have a Facebook page that is that powerful.  So, hey, everyone, if you want to sign a part-time job, you want to do some praxis, and you want to help us win the game, go out, start one of these groups, call it whatever you want, Freedoms for, I don't know, Clitoris, something like that.  Start the Freedoms for Clitoris group, get it populated, and then start weaponizing this shit against us.  the right.  So weaponize things that seem to be doing really well, such as racism, bigotry, all of that.  But you can do it in a smart way, all right?  If you want an example as how to use the news for good, check out some more news.  I'm not talking about John Krasinski.  He uses the news for evil and is also some kind of a strange CIA stooge.  I don't know what's up with that guy.  But anyways, if you want to use it for good, check out some more news.  He has a really good video on that recently about how to weaponize these kind of things.  This is scary.  Now let's go back to the revelations.  Ben Shapiro has partnered with Mad World News to game Facebook.  Each day, five large pages controlled by Mad World News, some with 2 million followers, post 10 articles a day from the Daily Wire.  These pages post the exact same content at the exact same time.  Boom, boom.  This aggregates it all.  Mad World News has built these pages by exploiting racial bias, religious bigotry, and violence.  So, hey, by the way, if everyone is wondering here why Ben Shapiro suddenly is on the name of massive shooters, why Ben Shapiro pops up on the name of, say, the Quebec Mosque shooter, probably because he's getting a lot of this Daily Wire stuff force-fed to him.  So it's creating this weird world where you can have a small team of people who suddenly have an enormous reach and voice with a lot less money than is necessary by someone like the New York Times or the Washington Post.  Granted, I'm no fan of either of those publications, especially, well, okay, we won't get into that.  That's another story for another time.  But at least there's some oversight there, right?  At least there's some checks and balances.  At least they're trying to be the fourth estate or maybe the eighth.  I'm not entirely sure at this point.  But as shitty as they are, they're definitely better than the Daily Wire.  But that being said, they're going to be the dodo bird very soon.  They'll disappear and they'll be just in the annals of history.  Meanwhile, the Daily Wire and its ilk will continue to propagate in this weird fashion because this shit works.  Here's an example.  In June 19, 2020, Mad World News wrote an article about a guy waving a Confederate flag on the side of the road who's threatening by a man with a gun.  Not mentioned.  this incident happened in 2015.  It doesn't matter.  There's no oversight.  Like I said, it doesn't need to be any kind of journalistic integrity.  What matters is A, making money and B, furthering the cause of all this racist bigotry.  because yes, it sells, but also there's something to be said about getting people to believe this shit because then they go to the voting booth and they vote out of fear.  So it keeps the right in control and at the same time it keeps Ben Shapiro in the monies.  The undisclosed relationship between Ben Shapiro and Mad World News appears to violate Facebook's rules.  You are required to disclose when you are posting content for money.  Facebook also bans artificially boosting the popularity of content.  But we all know that there's something to be said about Facebook allowing the alt-right all the way up to the Nazi-lite all the way up to the full-blown Nazi dominate the platform.  I don't think it has anything to do with the fact that Mark Zuckerberg likes any of that shit.  I think he hates it.  But I think Mark Zuckerberg cares more about one thing.  And again, this happens to be what all these people care about.  Can you guess what that is?  I'll give you a hint.  It starts with M. It ends with Y. There's a dance involved.  You know what's going on.  Facebook says it investigated and found no violation of its rules.  This isn't the first time Facebook gave Ben Shapiro a pass.  It raises questions about the relationship with Zuckerberg.  According to a source, he has spoken with Shapiro and Shapiro speaks with Zuck.  If you're interested in this story, you'll probably like my newsletter, Popular Information.  It's devoted to an independent account of e-journalism.  Sign up here.  Wow.  What?  What?  Monkey?  Mummy?  May?  Cock?  Cock.  It's cock.  The answer is cock.  No, it's not.  I'm not going to use that, all right?  I'm done placating people who want to vilify the delicious beauty, all right?  No more of this.  We're not going to associate this with that, all right?  I don't want some Pavlovian response where people see this face and all of a sudden they think of penises.  That's malarkey.  That's malarkey of the highest order.  I will not support it.  Anyways, this is all great.  Good that this is getting exposed.  Good that this is getting some exposure.  And let's go forth and spread the word.  Hey, friend. ",
