While we have been imprisoned in our homes, they have been preparing the new fear infrastructure out there.  All this for what?  Is it just the bitter mechanics of life?  I can hear the majority say, this is what we have to do to survive.  That's what the science says.  For those, I say what is happening now is a disgrace to science.  Just like religion has always been hijacked to serve their agendas.  Welcome to the 2020 upgrade.  Now they hijacked science.  We are all for science and betterment of mankind, but it must be examined and scrutinized when new evidence is introduced.  Let's look at the definition of the word in the dictionary.  Science is the intellectual and practical activity encompassing the systematic study of the structure and behaviour of the physical and natural world through observation and experiment.  Look at the keywords activity, study, observation and experiment.  It's process of enquiry and that's not what we are seeing right now.  when the establishment scientists get it wrong.  And they have been a few times.  All the wrong computer modeling is just one dimension. ",

How are the experts so sure of producing the V in that timeframe?  Can they create a safe V when they are still debating whether wearing a mask is beneficial or harmful?  And if the scientists can be that effective, why has the no V been developed for AIDS?  I mean, we had it now for over 35 years.
