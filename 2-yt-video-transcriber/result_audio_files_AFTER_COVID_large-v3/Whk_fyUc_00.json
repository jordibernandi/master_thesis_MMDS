I'm going to have to just block you on GP.  Shout out to Nigeria.  You love me in Nigeria?  I got a lot of love for Nigerians.  People think that because I ride hard on the Nigerian coons that I don't fuck with Nigerians.  I do.  Nigerians, we got some riders.  The problem is y'all sending all your coons over here.  That's the problem.  See, y'all getting rid of your coons in Nigeria and you're sending them over here.  Y'all don't want them and we don't want them either.  Y'all done got rid of your coons and we don't want them either.  That's the problem.  There you go.  Somebody got it right.  I'm in D.C.  right now.  Shout out to D.C I'm in Washington, D.C I'm not in the Bronx.  I'm in beautiful D.C.  right now.  I'll be out here for a few days handling business.  It's raining out here.  What's up?  I am A.M.  Browning.  But if you haven't checked out my latest broadcast on YouTube, man, that thing has really went viral.  A lot of people liked it.  where I talked about the election, this farce that was an election.  I dropped some real heavy stuff on that.  Yeah, a lot of people like that election response video.  And a lot of stuff that I said in that video, a lot of stuff has been popping off, man.  Like I said, in New York, they didn't pass this bill to make it mandatory to do those COVID vaccines in New York.  They made it mandatory.  Subtrade.  Nigga, you got on a magathon, dude.  We ain't the same, nigga.  Trey, you need to put some clothes on.  I'm about to block you, my nigga.  Yeah.  Where are my DC people?  I need a barber out here, too.  I got to get my shit tightened up out here.  So I need a good DC barber.  I need y'all to hit me up in the DMs.  Let me know some good barbers out here.  Yeah.  What's up, Plus Size Aqua Fina Kitty?  You said you don't like that video.  I sounded like I wanted Trump to stay.  Well, nigga, do you want Biden to stay?  I mean, we're getting a shitty deal on both ends, but we're getting a shittier deal on Biden.  So, nigga, anybody who's out here caping for Biden, nigga, you just as bad.  Nigga, we got to be caping for black empowerment, dude.  We shouldn't have the cape on for no damn body.  I ain't caping for anybody.  But I'm not going to let them pull a finesse and us not say nothing about it.  They pulled a finesse and then tried to put our name on their finesse.  So that's something that should be called out.  Yeah.  Yeah, they pulled a major finesse and they're still trying to put that shit on black people.  And we ain't getting none out of it, dude.  And did y'all see, I posted a clip on my Twitter of de Blasio's daughter.  Mayor de Blasio has a daughter who's crazy as cat shit.  And she did an interview and her ass made a Freudian slip.  I should post that on my Instagram.  She made a Freudian slip where they asked her how she felt about Biden getting elected.  And she was like, yeah, Biden stole the election.  I mean, he won the election.  I got to post that clip.  It's on my Twitter.  So there's some funny style stuff going on out here, man.  There's some real funny style stuff going on out here.  Yeah, but folks don't need to be praising no damn Biden at all, man.  And definitely not no goddamn Kamala Harris.  Yeah.  Oh Lord, what did Amanda Seale say this time?  I didn't hear, what did she say this time, Ann Brown?  What's up, you in Twitter jail?  Oh, my mask is in my pocket.  I can't talk to you guys with my mask on.  You said de Blasio's daughter said that on purpose?  Nigga.  She's hypers acting, so that was a little Freudian slip.  She couldn't really contain herself.  Yeah.  Anybody out here taping for Kamala, man, that ain't the business.  Yeah, and they need to really stop all this black girl magic shit with Kamala Harris.  Stop that bullshit, dude.  Stop that.  That's that Biden shit where we're supposed to be one big nigga.  You know what Biden said?  Remember Biden said, well, you know, Hispanics are diverse, but, you know, black people are pretty much the same.  That's that racist one big nigga theory that we're just one big global nigga and anybody can be our damn leader or spokesperson.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Absolutely not.  Absolutely not.  Who is Moe 3?  Who are these rappers that really don't nobody know.  who's shooting each other and all this other shit?  Who are these dudes, man?  I know the one brother down in Atlanta who, I think he was from Chicago, he went down to Atlanta and he got shot.  You know, that shit is corny.  But yeah, let's be clear.  Kamala Harris... is not a foundation of black American at all.  And if y'all want to argue about her blackness, argue about that shit in the Caribbean somewhere.  She's not a foundation of black American.  We know that for sure.  Okay.  We're talking about lineage.  We're talking about lineage.  You live in a country, this is a country where there is a lineage of people who go back to the founders of this country who are the foundation of black Americans.  We're talking about a lineage.  We don't need non-FBA people trying to be our spokespersons because they have dual allegiances.  You understand?  And she comes from a culture that has anti-black contempt.  That woman comes from an Indian culture and a Jamaican culture.  And let's be clear, there's a class over in Jamaica That elitist class in Jamaica who has anti-foundational black American contempt.  So she comes from two cultures that has anti-foundational black American contempt.  So to bring back MacLessons, I was thinking about doing that.  I was thinking about doing like a MacLessons Reloaded for Spotify.  The people from Spotify reached out.  They wanted me to put a podcast on there.  So I was thinking about doing something exclusive for Spotify, which is probably the MacLessons Reloaded.  yeah yeah so and notice all the people running around talking about all that black girl magic all these democratic shills these niggas who either work for hollywood or they work for these white supremacist um feminist organizations.  and look a lot of niggas in hollywood are going along with that whole kamala black bullshit.  because you know they can't get no acting gigs if they go against the grain.  If they go against the grain, they're not going to get no acting job.  What's up?  You still haven't seen Hidden Colors 5, brother?  Come on, man.  You're slipping.  You need to go to HiddenColorsFilm.com to see that.  You need to go to HiddenColorsFilm.com.  What's up, Court Court?  Yeah, I'm telling y'all, watch all the Negroes you see running around talking about, oh, I'm so proud of the black girl.  These are niggas who work for the Democrats.  They're told to say that stupid shit, man.  All these niggas who work for the Democrats, man, all of these niggas will sold you the fuck out.  We know Roland Martin and all those clowns, Van Jones with all that fake crying on TV.  All of these Negroes that's clicked in with these white feminist organizations, they've sold you out, man.
