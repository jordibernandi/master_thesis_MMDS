            "text": "Hello, everyone.  Yep.  He's back at it in the mud pit.  Aren't you?  He's already given himself one plop.  Oh, and there's the Shamu plunge that we've all come to know and love.  Look at you.  Look at you.  He just lays there.  He rubs his face in mud.  Oh, it's so gross.  Yep.  Oh, my gosh.  He's really splashing now.  Mama's got to get back because Mama has white on.  Not very user-friendly for a mud pit.  He's got a new tarp.  He's got a nice new tarp that shades him in here, which is nice.  Okay.  There goes Chris Pye with the garbage.  Bob, here he comes.  Oh, no, you're not pulling those grapes down.  Oh, no.  Look at him.  Look at him.  He'll knock that.  Let me tell you something.  He'll knock the chair over for some grapes.  Let me.  Noble, you got yourself in quite the predicament there, haven't you?  Fine.  You want grapes?  Come get them.  There you go.  Look at you.  Look at how muddy you stinky boy.  You're a stinky boy.  But you love grapes.  He got me yesterday.  He rubbed right on me with his mud.  Oh, there's some salad.  Mommy put some salad down for you.  Look, he's got like, look at him, half.  It's like one of those makeup commercials where half the face is done and half the face is not done.  There you go.  That's what it is.  All his grass grew in in his pasture area.  He loves it.  He just goes and chomps on the weeds and the grass.  So we let it grow in here because he likes to dig through it.  Keeps him busy.  Don't it, bud?  I don't know what we're going to do about a mud pit for you in the winter.  I'm not quite sure.  Are you?  Look, hi, everyone.  Thanks, you've got mud on my phone.  Yep, there it is, a snout mark.  A snout mark on the phone.  Okay.  Yep, I've got to fill up his mud pit a little more.  Oh.  No, you can't get in the bag.  He sees me put it on here.  He'll wait a few minutes.  He's a little patient.  There you go.  He loves grapes.  He absolutely loves grapes.  Chris got him hooked on grapes.  That was totally Chris's doing.  Look at that tail.  Up.  High knee shot.  So... Oh, yes.  You see that piece of wood?  We have to put that piece of wood there because Noble figured out how to open the door.  So that piece of wood keeps him from being able to open the door himself most days.  Okay.  What are we doing?  What are we doing, bud?  We got some newbies in the pen.  I'll show you.  I'll do a video with the newbies too.  We'll do a video with the newbies.  Hi.  He's looking for the grapes.  Here's what he's doing right now.  Oh, my goodness, Noble.  What are we going to do with you?  You're half caked.  We're going to have to hose you down, which is your papa's job.  He's the hoser.  It doesn't matter if I hose him.  Chris will take the hose from me and act like I didn't do it correctly and re-hose Noble.  So we go through this every time.  Oh, you finally found the organic salad mix?  He's like, nope, I want grapes.  Grapes and weeds.  Whoop.  Oh, my gosh.  Oh, my gosh, Noble.  So you're going to play in here for a little while?  You're going to stay in here while Mommy goes and does some stuff?  Mommy will throw some pig feed out for you?  Yep.  Noble loves it in here.  Oh, sorry.  That was my fingers.  Sorry, guys.  Yep.  He will mosey his way out to the grazing area.  So I'm going to go get his pig feed ready.  I'll pause it and I'll go get his pig feed ready.  Okay.  There it is.  Nobo Up he hurt.  here he comes.  He's gonna make his way over.  I just chucked the pig feed.  I'm on the other side now and Here he comes moseying on out.  It's pretty warm here today guys moseying on out.  He heard the pig feed drop and Yesterday, Noble stole part of a sandwich.  The other day, I had to wrestle it out of his mouth.  Oh, it was so much fun.  I felt like I was in a rodeo event.  Let me tell you.  Never ends.  Never ends with Noble.  The fun never ends, does it, bud?  Don't turn your backside to the camera.  Let me tell you, pigs are smart.  You may know I'm filming him.  What you doing, Nobes?  Up.  There's a delivery coming up.  There he goes.  Noble runs with the delivery trucks.  It's hysterical.  There he goes.  He's going back in, people.  Here we come around.  Hi.  What, are you afraid of the delivery driver?  here we are reunited and it feels so good down it all right everyone.  they have a lovely afternoon while I continue to eat grapes and hunt for weeds.  god bless.
