            "text": "So there's a video going around by Dr.  Shiva Iyaduria, and in it he puts up this graph here, and it's a metric of something that he plots based on the votes in Kent County, Michigan, and he's confused as to why this line slopes down.  So what I did is I set up a kind of a simulation of voting possibilities to explain why that happens, and as you can see I've kind of duplicated the line sloping down here.  Now he has this other thing here where he says the line kinks off to the side, but really that's just a very arbitrary way of drawing a line through here.  You could very easily just draw a straight line through the entire thing as I have here.  So what's actually going on here?  I set up this simulator so this square here represents all of the voters.  On one side, there's the people who normally vote Republican.  On the other side, there's the people who normally vote Democrat.  And we can move between the two.  So we can kind of simulate different precincts where, for example, the Republican vote is very low, like over here.  and precincts where the Democrat vote is very low and the Republican vote is very high.  And that gives you this graph of different precincts throughout Michigan.  Some of them are more Democrat, some of them are more Republican in Kent County.  So what's actually, what is this graph?  What is it representing?  Well, it's a little confusing based on his description, but I eventually figured it out.  He's taking on the x-axis here what he calls the Straight Republican Party Score.  which is the percentage of people who just voted for a Republican straight ticket divided by the total number of people who voted for straight tickets, which is the Republican straight ticket plus the Democrat straight ticket.  And we're ignoring all of the parties for now because they're pretty small in this analysis.  So it's essentially this rectangle here divided by this larger rectangle, the red plus blue rectangle.  Then against that is plotting The difference between that and the same thing for individual voters, people who chose to vote for individual parties in each race.  So they could vote, say, for one party for the Senate and another party for the President.  So it's the ratio of this rectangle here, the Republican individual Trump voters, the individual Trump voters to the individual Biden voters over here.  So it's this rectangle divided by this rectangle, but it's not just plotting these two, it's plotting the difference between them.  So we can see if I put that back and move from left to right, we have this difference here between the two, and you can see it's plotted over here.  Now, Eideria's key mistake is that he assumed that all people who were Republicans would vote for Trump because Republicans all love Trump so much.  Of course, this isn't true.  If it was true, you get what he says he should expect, which is a flat line centered around zero because the proportions of these two things never actually changes.  It's always the exact same proportions, this to this and this to this, the exact same proportions.  Of course, if you add something into the mix like Republicans who vote for Biden, Republican individual voters who vote for Biden, and Democrat individual voters who vote for Trump, then this changes things.  Now, if we go through the various proportions, you'll see we get a sloped line.  And it's always going to slow down.  It doesn't actually matter whether you've got all Republicans or all Democrats switching.  It's always going to slow down.  The reason is because this ratio here always goes from 0 to 1, whereas this one goes from different values.  But the point is that if you introduce something like this, which is an expected thing, we expect people to do this, you get this downward sloping line.  And you can see this downward sloping line is similar to what we get in this graph.  And you can adjust the amounts of people.  I think perhaps more Republicans would actually vote for Biden than Democrats would vote for Trump.  And that changes the graph to be more like the one we see in the picture here.  Of course, it's more complicated than this.  This is a fairly straight, linear thing.  Things might happen, for example, like the proportion of people who vote Republican straight ticket might not be the same as the Democrats.  They might be more, or it could be the other way around.  Or it could be, in fact, that it's skewed so that the more people vote Republican, the more likely they are to vote a straight ticket and vice versa.  So it could end up something a bit more like this, which is even more of a straight line.  So I think this kind of illustrates a couple of things.  First of all, this graph here, the fact that he's confused about how it could be slowed down, is he actually confused or is it a bit misleading?  I don't know.  I tend to assume that he's just a bit confused, but perhaps he has a preference to express here and he's expressing it by maybe deliberately misleading.  I don't know.  It's just a speculation on my part.  And the other point is that it's actually quite complicated.  It was kind of difficult at first to follow his explanation of where these numbers actually came from.  And it took me a while to replicate the graph, which I did eventually replicate the exact same graph.  Here's my version of it.  It's basically the same one.  And it's not intuitively obvious as to why the line would slope down.  I thought initially that if we had these flipped around, then the line would go up.  But of course, that doesn't actually happen.  The line goes down no matter which way around you have it.  So it's actually an unintuitive metric.  And it's also kind of, in some ways, kind of a pointless metric because it doesn't really tell you anything because there's so many other variables like How does the split between split ticket voters, people who vote one party for one seat and one for another, how does that vary based on the percentage of people voting one way or the other?  I have it skewing here for the amount of straight versus individual, but that too is unknown as to how much that's an actual factor.  And it didn't really take very much to replicate the results as we see them more or less the same here as they are in the graph below.  So there you go.  There's no real significance to this other than showing that some people flipped their vote for president from their normal party preference. ",
