            "text": "Yeah, God has given us an eyewitness testimony in the book of Genesis.  And he's laid out the history of the earth, starting with supernatural creation, where trees were already bearing fruit.  If we were going back and looking at those trees from our everyday experience, we'd expect those trees have been around for a while to have grown and produced fruit.  And we see rocks that by our normal observation today, we would think have taken a long time to form.  But no, God was there and he supernaturally instantly created them.  That's what he says in his eyewitness record in the book of Genesis.  And then he goes on to say there was a time when he judged the earth because of human wickedness at the time of the flood.  And at that time, he caused catastrophic things to happen.  Water came from inside of the earth, molten material came from inside the earth, and the earth's surface was totally reshaped.  All the high hills and the mountains were covered in water.  And Noah came out to a totally different world to the one that he'd experienced before the flood.  And so geological processes were speeded up at such magnitudes and rates that we can't even imagine today.  We can only get hints at by stepping back and looking at the geological record and looking at the big picture of the geologic record.  I think that's very important.  Just like we stepped back before, yes, we can see this cinder cone volcano behind us looks quite large, but it's small by comparison to what we see even in human history with Mount St Helens.  But these lava flows are small by comparison to what we see in the geologic record.  And so we see evidence that we need to open our eyes to a bigger picture on a bigger scale and start to think in terms of what was going on around the world at that time. ",
