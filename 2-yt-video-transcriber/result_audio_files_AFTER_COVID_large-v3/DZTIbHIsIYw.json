So she's gonna create a male account and then she's gonna have the experience of trying to get women on that app to date her.  Sada is a smart girl and she's pretty sympathetic to male struggles.  So she probably appreciates on a cognitive level that this is not going to be easy.  That being a man on one of these dating apps is not easy, but I'm curious to see her journey as she actually goes through the experience of being in a man's shoes and trying to chat up women.  All right, let's go ahead and give her a call.  Hi Sada, how are you doing? ",

Okay, so I think I've chosen the three photos that I want to send her.  I'll show you.  I've got this one.  that seems pretty standard.  It's just a photo of me looking at a camera.  I chose this one from a few years ago on like a boat cruise that I took.  And this one is kind of just to troll her a little bit, make it a little bit harder.  It's from a community dance project that I did a couple of years ago, but it's a pretty strange photo.  So I think she'll have fun trying to explain that one to potential matches.

Now I'm just thinking about the story I need to invent.  I want to prepare a few points just for the conversation to be more natural.  I want to like be very direct but also smooth in the approach.  So yeah, let's see how this goes.  so i already put his pictures on tinder and i invented some bio just some simple stuff.  hi my name is alex.  i live and work in lisbon as a psychologist looking for a nice lady to develop a meaningful relationship with and enjoy the pleasures of life.  it's simple it's good.  and yeah there we go.  i'm going to start doing some matches.  this is day three of tinder operation And it's going well.  On the first day, we only got five matches.  And I was like, I was stressing out.  I was just like, this is going to be much harder than what I was thinking.  I mean, I thought this was going to be like easy peasy, okay.  I'm going to text these women.  And these women are going to want to go on a date with me.  And I'm going to match a lot.  And that didn't happen.  On the group of five, there was one that was like really gorgeous.  Another one that I don't know.  why the hell did she match with me.  I mean, the whole conversation was just pure pain, pure agony.  She was like answering with two or three words in each message.  And I was like, why? ",

I asked if she wanted to go on a date with me and she was like, no, but thanks.  Get the hell out of here.  I mean, it was just like... Why?  Day two, I was blown away.  I mean, I was like, oh, this is it.  This is the real deal.  We got more 28 matches.  28, it's a lot.  Let's be honest here.  On average... those women were not that good looking.  I'm not being selective and I think that's a problem.  Here, I'm just swiping like a maniac and see what I can get.  I don't think I should do that anymore.  I want to try a different approach.  I want to be more selective and I'm going to try to think more like a man.  Let me try to pick and swipe the most beautiful women that appear.  I want the more attractive ones.  And I want to see that if I'm not that selective, can I get as many matches?  So here's the Tinder account.  I don't know exactly what this is, but this is like... I think there are a lot of women that are liking me.  This is like has... 17.5 here.  I don't know what that is.  But yeah, here's a chat.  Here are all the women I've been texting.  I just want to go like with very gorgeous ones and I just want to see if I can match with them.  Uh, so I think this one is Very agreeable.  I think this one too.  I'm going to put a like on her and it's a match Good.  I'm going to text her saying hi How are you?  And let's continue.  Julia, I think this Julie is very gorgeous too.  This one, very gorgeous.  Oh, this one is interesting.  It's like a booty pic.  I don't know why.  We have some more skin.  So yeah, let's just put a like on this one too.  And it's a match.  I'm being more selective.  I mean, this is going well.  So I'm going to keep this and I want to see what happens by the end of the day.  So this is day five.  And at this point, I am not motivated.  I am not happy with the results.  On day three, I got 13 matches.  Yesterday I got one and today I got one.  In the beginning I had lots of matches, but I wasn't actually being selective.  And let's be honest here, I was matching with women that were not that attractive.  I was getting like women on mid thirties, higher.  What amazed me wasn't this decrease of matches, was actually the replying.  I mean, How can I get these women to go on a date with me if they don't even reply to me?  I was so confused.  I mean, if we match, why aren't we talking?  I matched with so many and I got no response.  I saw a lot of Instagram stuff, follow me on Instagram, and I didn't thought this would happen.  I didn't thought I would match and they wouldn't reply.  From what I talked to my friends and maybe myself, that doesn't happen.  if I matched like the man doesn't reply to me.  Like that doesn't happen.  If I compare an experience that a woman has on a dating app and that a man has on a dating app, it's much different.  And it's weird that I struggle so much and that if I change like the picture to a woman, I don't struggle at all.  I didn't thought this would be like this because I find Alex, in terms of looks, good looking and interesting.  I put he was a damn psychologist.  That's super interesting.  I don't know if people get depressed after being on a dating app, but I don't know.  I just feel like down at this point.  I don't know why I feel down.  It's not even me.  This is not very healthy, is it?  There are maybe some psychological effects from this whole thing.  I mean, I'm down now and it's not even my damn picture and my damn life, but I'm down.  I really thought I would get a better response.  I mean, I just don't know.  I thought this was going to be more easy.  Like, oh, I really wasn't expecting this.  I don't want to do this again. ",

Once the Tinder algorithm starts to assign you like a hidden value, then you start to get matches according to your actual kind of desirability on the app.  And it starts to go way, way, way down.

I know what they want to hear.  I'm going with some pretty good messages and it's going to work out.  But it didn't.  I'm so confused.  I don't know.  I don't know about anything anymore.  I was with a woman mindset.  I thought what happens to a woman in a dating app would actually happen to a man.  I was like, meaningful relationship.  Not even a damn meaningful relationship these women want.  What?  My friends can tell me the experience, but we can't really feel the whole thing.  We can feel a little bit.  We have empathy, of course.  But once we are actually in the situation, it's much different.  And we can actually feel the... Maybe what some guys feel.  And it's not good.  It's not a good experience.  For me, it's very good to go through this, really, because I'm getting more, I'm just expanding my awareness of everything. ",

And thank you to all of the women who watch this channel, taking the time to empathize with the difficulties that men face in the dating market.  understanding things from the male point of view.  If you enjoyed Saada's contribution to this video and you'd like to see more experiments with Saada, please comment below, especially if you have any suggestions for what you'd like to see.  This video was shortened down for YouTube.  The final debriefing conversation with Saada went for a full half hour, and we went into a lot more depth on her experiences and a large number of topics, including a more thorough exploration of those Tinder conversations where she was successful.  In fact, in the final tally, she actually convinced seven women to go on dates with her, and even though she was disappointed with that result, that was actually more than I would have predicted.  I think that her disappointment reflects the vastly different expectations each gender has for success in the dating market.  If you'd like to see the full uncut version of the whole conversation with Sada, I have posted it as a bonus video on my Patreon page.  For every video that I post on YouTube, I post an additional bonus video on Patreon.  That means that at the moment, you're only seeing half of my total content.  If you'd like to see the other half, then please go and sign up at my Patreon.  Not only will you see an extended version of this video, but you'll get instant access to a whole bunch of other exclusive videos.  It's just $5 a month and it is a great way to support the channel.
