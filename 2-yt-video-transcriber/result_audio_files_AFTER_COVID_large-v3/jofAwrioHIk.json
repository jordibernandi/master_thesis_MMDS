            "text": "Hi there everybody.  Peter of England here.  It is Friday.  It's the 14th of August and it's disappointing news that I hear on the radio and it's disappointing news that I read in the newspapers and so I thought I would make a video just to try and alert some people out there who might be a little more open-minded about this so-called pandemic that's raging throughout the world.  The two topics that I have just heard, one, Boris, Boris the Clone Johnson, has just made an announcement that he is extending an olive branch, an olive branch of hope to stimulate certain key industries in the United Kingdom when the UK is at a point of recession, and these key industries are lifting some of the restrictions on casinos, bowling alleys, nail bars and the such.  And in addition to that, though, what he's doing with the carrot and the stick, he's ensuring that if any of you disobey the compulsory wearing of a mask in certain areas, which is probably soon to be in all outdoor areas, even, you know, outdoor full stop period, he's raising the fine for that to \u00a33,200.  So at a time when people are economically and psychologically repressed, he's coming along and issuing fines that you don't even get for I don't know driving your car 160 miles an hour down the down the motorway so you have to ask yourself what's going on here.  it's not a very good state of affairs and I think my warning to you is that it's going to be coming your way a little bit worse as the summer unfolds.  now.  don't forget weren't you actually told that this virus is susceptible to hot temperatures and as the summer progresses as as is typical for for flu related viral, virological infection, that it would actually drop away and it would stop.  However, not only has it not stopped, it seems to be getting worse.  So what I think is happening here is the global New World Order agenda.  is that they are passing the hat around and keeping everybody on tenterhooks, keeping everybody in the belief that, oh well, it's surging here, it's digressing there.  So what we've just heard is that from 4 a.m.  on Saturday morning, people traveling back from certain places in Europe, from France, from Monaco, from some islands called the Turks and Caicos Islands and the Andos Islands, and maybe one or two other places.  Now, because France, once having the lowest R number, i.e.  a fictional number which relates to whether you've got high infection rates of this so-called virus, What we have now is France being put in a tit-for-tat battle on the quarantine list.  So that means anybody returning, any Brits returning from France and these other places I've just mentioned, have got to now forcibly quarantine themselves, so they say, for 14 days.  Now, the other story which is a bit of a concern has just come out on BBC Radio, BBC World Service, and that is concerning the idea of vaccinations, which I'm sure all of you out there are just... you can't wait to receive your first dose administered with some type of vaccination cattle gun, probably by a vet or by someone in the military.  or other members of, let's say, the NHS, which are our caring and beautiful angels of death, that Joseph Mengele, the angel of death himself from the Gestapo concentration camps, would be very happy to have working for him.  Because don't forget what they've done here is they've turned all the medical profession into a Gestapo, a medical Gestapo there shaming you and telling you what needs to be done in the name of white-coated citizens.
