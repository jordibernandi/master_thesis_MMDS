There is a type of ad hominem fallacy where you can argue that somebody's point is invalid simply because they've brought up something that you've deemed as your genetic source for invalidity.  That's not how you tell if somebody's losing an argument, okay?  Sometimes it's when they get incredibly angry, but even then, that's not a good way of telling if they've lost an argument.  The way to tell that somebody's lost an argument is to fact-check the shit that they've said.  If it's a public debate, then it's hard to really quantify a winner or loser there in certain situations.  Now, there are some that I'm okay saying there's a clear winner, like Ken Ham versus Bill Nye.  Bill Nye slapped the shit out of Ken Ham, but Fact of the matter is, whenever Greg Locke here says that the left loses an argument when the race card gets played, what if the conversation is about race, Greg?

He literally had been thrown out of multiple BLM groups before he actually did anything at the Capitol.  So he's also not the main instigator.  That basically would mean that a person of color who is an Antifa insurgent, quote unquote, is somehow more compelling and provocative than Donald Trump.  And don't don't.  You know, don't get me wrong, Greg.  I agree that there are people who are Antifa that are certainly better rhetoricians than Donald Trump.  But I don't think you'd ever admit to that. ",

Unless he wants to say that the FBI is wrong, which don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that they are a perfect organization by any means, by any metric, but to come to the conclusions that Greg Locke does, he has to literally ignore material reality and make up his own and then sit there and chug seminal fluid from One America News Network and other sources that are more right-wing than Fox News, which is... Not not outside the realm of possibility.  I don't know exactly which news sources Greg stands, but he certainly hits the mainstream media, which, you know, I can understand that.  But it is fun, honestly, to see this kind of meltdown.  Not because I'm taking any particular joy in it.  Don't get me wrong, I am.  But because, like I said before, it does give you a little bit of insight into the type of mentality that drives an individual like this.  That drives someone who is in a position of privilege... so high that they have to maintain the facade that they are a victim in order to function day to day in life.  But that's all we're going to cover from Greg today.  I'm interested to see what the rest of his library of tweets and also videos is going to look like within the first few weeks of Biden's presidency.  I'm very interested to see what's going to happen here.  But if you want to see that whenever we get to that, go ahead and hit the like button, hit subscribe, and hit the bell notification icon so that you'll know whenever a new episode comes out.  Also, that like button helps a ton in the algorithm.  If you didn't like what I just said or anything that I've covered, then go ahead and leave a dislike.  I mean, those help me as well.  Thank you all for watching, and hopefully this video has caught you at a good time.  Hopefully. ",
