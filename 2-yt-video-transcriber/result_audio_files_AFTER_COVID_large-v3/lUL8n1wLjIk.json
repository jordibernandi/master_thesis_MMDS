            "text": "You'll definitely never find this law in any physics textbook, at least not one that isn't published by a Christian university press.  In physics, there would be no need to specify that what you're talking about is material because physics obviously only deals with the physical.  The only reason the word material is in there is because they want to arbitrarily exempt anything supernatural from this so-called law.  Secondly, the way the law is phrased is tautological.  Of course for every effect there's a cause, because an effect is, by definition, an event or entity which is dependent upon a cause.  This law would make more sense if it stated that every material event or entity requires a cause.  However, it would also be inconsistent with physics.  At the quantum level, there are particles which seem to pop into existence uncaused all the time.  Thirdly, simultaneous causation makes no discernible sense.  If two events or entities are simultaneous, the idea that one depends on the other but not vice versa is impossible to demonstrate.  I think the reason this bit about simultaneous causation is in there is because apologists want to be able to say that a god can cause time to exist without there already being any time in which to carry out an act of creation.  You can't cause time to exist if you need time in which to carry out any act of causation.  Also, all interactions, that is, anytime anything does anything to anything else, are mediated by the four fundamental forces.  Gravity, electromagnetism, and the weak and strong nuclear forces.  And those don't propagate instantaneously.  They can only go the speed of light.  A cause can't have an effect that is instantaneous if the force mediating that interaction travels at a finite speed.  Fourthly, what is meant by the assertion that a cause must be greater than an effect?  Greater in what sense?  Humans can make all kinds of things that are greater than they are.  I can make a pile of rocks that's taller than me.  I can make an adding machine that can add numbers faster and more accurately than me.  So in what sense must a cause be greater than its effect?  If for every action there's an equal and opposite reaction, then it seems as though causes can be equal to their effects rather than needing to be greater. ",

If by nothing you mean the complete non-existence of anything, well, scientists don't actually say that the universe popped into existence from that, because there never was nothing in that sense.  Of the 13.7 billion years that time has been passing, at no time was there nothing.  There obviously was never a time when at least time did not exist.  Nothing was never a state of affairs.  The way apologists seem to conceive of the beginning of the universe is that first there was nothing, then at some later time there was something.  If you think of it this way, it makes sense to ask, if nothing changed to something, what caused that change?  However, since the beginning was not preceded by nothing, rather it would be clearer to say that it was not preceded at all, there was never any change from nothing to something.  If no such change occurred, then there is no need to account for it.  There's no need to explain an event that never happened. ",
