And we're sitting down with Masako Ganaha, who has been analyzing some of the video footage of what happened.  Now, Masako is a Japanese independent journalist.  She runs a YouTube channel, and she has some very interesting analysis specifically on the shooting of Ashley Babbitt in the Capitol building and some Antifa involvement around that.  Masako, it's real great having you on Crossroads. ",

So I could see who was doing what.  And I was seeing one video that was about 44 minutes long.  And this video had a title named Jason X. And he was identified as one of the Antifa by Andy Ngo.  And he took the video from beside of the lady who got shot.  And he was taking this video.  And I think that everybody who watched those video only see what happened to that lady, right?  But I was watching the people around her.  And I just, I saw two men who was leading the crowd.  And one man got in front of the people facing one of the, I think, police or guard.  And he was saying, hey, everybody, he was saying.  And it looked like he was trying to calm everybody down.  But what he was doing was, I think he was trying to Everybody get upset so that people would attack.  That's what I thought.  And he didn't have anything at first. ",

            "text": "In his hands.  But he had his body right next to him.  He has a yellow flag around his body.  He gave this man a black helmet.  And when he got the helmet, he took his hat off.  The hat was really thick, winter hat.  So I think he used it as a cushion to hit the glass with the helmet.  So he started to crush the window.  And then one man right next to him, he had a stick and he was also hitting the glass.  But I did not know that if he was part of them or not.  But those two were actually clearly communicating when they were doing this action.  And then he broke the window and then the lady climb up the window and she got shot.  And the camera goes to the women, right?  But I was looking those two guys.  One with the yellow flag went to the crowds.  And the other one who actually hit the window went to downstairs where the police were.  And I saw him.  He was, he did not escape.  He was down there and he had his backpack.  And it was gray and with black on the back.  So I could see that was his back with the color.  And I saw him that he was opening the backpack and he was putting his hat, I think, or shirt inside the backpack.  And he changed his appearance.  so that I think he could manage to stay there without getting caught or without people noticing that was him.  And so how does, when I saw this, he's not Trump supporter?  because he was leading the crowd and communicating with those other guy and he was changing his appearance.  How would Trump supporter do that?  He was trying to agitate people to go inside the building further so that they have the confrontation between transporter and then police.  And then funny thing is that I had one more camera who got the picture of the person who took that previous video.  Am I explaining correct?  So I could see who took that previous video.  And I saw his face.  And from that video, Andy know Andy identified.  The person who took the video was one of the members of Antifa.  And he was taking the picture, the video, and I think he was there to report as if Trump supporters attacked and police shot the woman who was unarmed.  And he was saying that she is dead.  How can you tell?  She just got shot and the medic was there.  So people are trying to help her. ",

But Trump supporters say, back the blue.  So they have a different opinion.  But from this occasion, they can make Trump supporters upset with police.  So he was saying, she is dead, she is dead.  And then he started to walk around and telling people, she's dead, she's dead.  So then people get upset with cops.  And so Trump supporters started to yell at police.  And then, so from that video, I could see that there are two players dressed like Trump supporters.  And then you have this Antifa guy trying to report as he was one of the witness.  telling that he saw what he saw.  But eventually he appeared on CNN saying that he was a witness and he saw the women unarmed.  But CNN didn't say about him or why he was there. ",

And then one of the other individuals, who I would say is very suspicious at this point, actually I met in the parking lot afterwards.  I was in the parking lot of the Capitol building during this whole thing, just talking to people.  Came out and was shouting, walking down the street.  They shot her, they shot her, and was really agitating as he walked.  And this individual seemed suspicious.  I published a video of him talking about the shooting of Ashley Babbitt.

We've of course talked about how they do these operations and how Antifa does them.  Going back to Marxist tactics though, the dividing tactics they would call dialectical materialism, identify, contradict, eliminate the middle, to divide people, to split people, and then using what they call agitation propaganda to get people agitated, angry, and turning against each other.  How do you see these tactics being played out?  You said you noticed the same tactics used in Japan by these radical groups as being used by these groups you saw in Washington.  Oh, how? ",

And then don't think too not many people would analyze those video or they cannot reach to the actual video because social media would ban the video.  so i was lucky to go got those videos and um what i was gonna say.  so and then the actual AP happens at site.
