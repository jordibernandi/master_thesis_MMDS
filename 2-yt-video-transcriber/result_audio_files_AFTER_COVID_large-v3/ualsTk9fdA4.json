            "text": "What is up, everybody?  We got some cool freaking news tonight here on Twitter where we got Obamagate trending at 1.12 million tweets, okay?  And just for a little gauge, here are the other things that are trending.  Kenya, 82,000.  Jeremy Piven, they won't even say.  Tanya, 74,000.  27,000, okay?  1.12 million tweets right now.  And this was kicked off, well, first for the fact that they released all the transcripts.  If you haven't gone through the transcripts, I spent days going through these.  Go to my last video here.  I go through a bunch of them and it was fake.  It was all fake.  They had nothing.  This was a complete political head job put in place by Obama and Hillary to take out an incoming president, which is pretty freaking bad.  It's never happened.  I mean, that is above and beyond.  So Obama, I would not want to be Obama right now.  And of course, it was requested by an anon, Q+, can you retweet Obamagate?  And this isn't a picture of that, but I'd seen it earlier, and he waited.  to exactly 3 11 the perfect time.  i think it was about two hours after he was asked and 3 11 is what was the united states secret service code name for hussein r renegade.  renegade is a freaking traitor.  okay they knew all along.  expand your thinking.  i'm sure everyone behind the scenes knew what obama was.  he was an usurper president who was set in to wreak havoc and do what they had been doing, but just on a higher level.  And he infiltrated every part of the DOJ and every system while everyone was lulled to sleep by the 24-7 of the media fawning all over him, blah, blah, blah.  That's what silver tongues do.  And this is great.  President Trump just put this on his Instagram account.  You had fun investigating me.  Now it's my turn.  And obviously it has started already.  But just the release of all these documents, everything.  This is so freaking awesome, man.  And here we go, Obamagate, 1.12 million tweets.  And you can see here that Inevitable IET retweeted just now a screenshot of 1.14 million tweets.  Right in here, live time, as mine says, 1.12.  So, of course, they are erasing these in real time.  So what should this really say?  Maybe this is really 2 million tweets.  Who knows?  Who knows how many?  Because that's... 20,000 right there, right on the table within 32 seconds of what he probably posted about a minute ago now.  So not only has this got over a million tweets, but they're actually erasing them at incredible clips.  And it is freaking glorious.  Where we go one, we go all.  Thank you.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Thank you. ",
