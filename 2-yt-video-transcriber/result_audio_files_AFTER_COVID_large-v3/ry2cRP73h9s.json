            "text": "Well, hello there.  A couple of weeks ago, I put out a video called Why Didn't Africa Colonize Europe?  where I attempted to answer a potentially racist and slightly inaccurate question about why the colonization of Africa from the 17th to 19th century was such a one-sided affair.  the answer i gave was essentially that europe and asia enjoyed a combination of agriculture and very expansive trade routes spanning from portugal to shanghai whereas african societies were more limited by the shape of the continent and as we're about to find out probably didn't have as much need to expand anyway.  But what also caught my attention was a strange number of people in the comment section pointing out that sub-Saharan Africans were so backwards that they hadn't invented the wheel.  This was a claim I had never heard before, and it definitely seemed to clash with my own understanding of what these societies achieved.  for example there was the mali empire which was well known for the excessive wealth of its rulers in particular mansa musa who ruled in the fourteenth century and is often labelled as the richest man who ever lived.  he was so rich that historians simply describe his wealth as incalculable.  on his pilgrimage to mecca he visited egypt and was carried through cairo in a litter where he threw chunks of gold into the streets For an impression of how wealthy this guy was, the amount of gold he threw out ended up causing an inflation crisis in Egypt that lasted 12 years.  And then to the east, there was the kingdom of Aksum, where the philosopher Zira Yaacoub and his understudy wrote the Hatata, which translates to inquiry.  Published in 1667, their work was basically an African enlightenment.  Though a believer in God, Jacob's work brought forward the idea that stories within different religions are often contradictory, and should therefore always be doubted and critically examined.  An idea that is often attributed today to David Hume, who wouldn't write it until a century later in his inquiry on miracles.  The book also has this quite familiar passage.  All men are equal in the presence of God, and all are intelligent since they are his creatures.  He did not assign one people for life, another for death, one for mercy, another for judgment.  Our reason teaches us that this sort of discrimination cannot exist in the sight of God, who is perfect in all his works.  The idea that men are created equal would later be attributed to John Locke, who wrote it twenty years later, and the writers of the Declaration of Independence, ",
