            "text": "Hey, Migtos, this is Vention.  Man, let me tell you, that dry fast, the effects of that were just, are just like tremendously more than even a conventional fast.  I broke my fast this morning.  I wussed out after like 31 hours, but then I, uh, uh, yeah, broke my fast with a low, with a zero carb meal, and man, I can feel that, the energy coming in, it's just pouring in, and freaking, man, I feel freaking amazing, uh, I, I don't know, uh, people are saying, oh, it's so dangerous, oh, it's dangerous, wringing hands, oh, but, uh, Dudes, it seems to have a pretty darn good effect.  I lost like eight pounds.  Not that that's a big deal, but I'm... I'm lower than I've ever been, as far as weight goes, by like a pound.  But I'm still in the friggin' zone of healthy weight, according to the American Medical Association.  So I think people should stop wringing their hands and having conniptions that I'm like some kind of Auschwitz candidate, because I'm not.  And chances are I'm significantly more healthy than a lot of people who are the way I was like just eight or nine, ten months ago.  So yeah, I think you should stop freaking out and let me handle this.  Not that I'm unwelcoming of suggestions, but all these people are saying, you need to get into a doctor and you need to take your chemo and radiation, blah, blah, you should take your freaking chemo, yeah.  Well, you know, read between the lines.  So there you go.  I think I'm going to do a little work on the camper.  And later today, I think I might just reward the people who made that Sonic movie for actually listening to the fans and go put my money where my mouth is and then laugh at birds of prey, which is because that's totally empty.  And that ought to be good for a laugh.  And then come home and... I've got some things to do.  And I can't really do much as far as arranging a PET scan on the weekend.  So please excuse me if I'm going to do something fun in between now and then.  So I'll talk to you later, my brothers.  And don't get married.  And don't get cancer either.  And I'm thinking, considering my experiences in cancer, marriage is clearly... more difficult and much more of a pain in the ass than having stage four colon cancer.  And don't get married. ",
