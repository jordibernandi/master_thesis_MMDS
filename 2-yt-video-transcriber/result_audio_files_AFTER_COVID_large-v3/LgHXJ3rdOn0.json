Fires are burning, and we have a president who fans the flames.  He can't stop the violence because for years he's fomented it.  But his failure to call on his own supporters to stop acting as an armed militia in this country shows how weak he is.  Violence will not bring change.  It will only bring destruction.  It's wrong in every way.  If I were president, my language would be less divisive.  I'd be looking to lower the temperature in this country, not raise it.  Donald Trump is determined to instill fear in America because Donald Trump adds fuel to every fire.  This is not who we are.  I believe we'll be guided by the words of Pope John Paul II, words drawn from the scriptures.  Be not afraid.  I'm Joe Biden, and I approve this message. ",
