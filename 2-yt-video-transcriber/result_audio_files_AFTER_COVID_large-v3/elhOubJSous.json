            "text": "Hey everyone and welcome in this article in the BBC News Online by BBC political editor Laura Kumsberg.  It's about Boris and his fight against the Lurgy titled Power is no protection from harm.  Laura lets slip, in my opinion, why media and elites want us all terrified and locked away.  It's only a short one, this one, so let's dive straight in, shall we?  And then you can let me know what you think as well.  After a day in a strange vacuum, an official statement emerged from Downing Street just after 8 o'clock.  Having struggled to shake off symptoms and having been taken to hospital 24 hours before, Number 10 announced that the Prime Minister has been moved into intensive care.  I hope you're best consumed, Boris.  Fight, mate, fight.  As I'm sure most of us do.  Downing Street has made clear that Boris Johnson is still conscious and it is understood that he's not yet received any kind of ventilation to help him breathe.  But he has received oxygen.  But the decision was taken to move him to part of St Thomas' Hospital where that kind of treatment would be immediately available if required.  So it's not all doom and gloom just yet.  I mean, just because he's in intensive care doesn't mean that he's on death's door as of yet.  I mean, you've got to remember he is the Prime Minister, isn't he?  He's going to get quick treatment.  It has been clear for many days that Mr Johnson was taking far longer to recover than had initially been expected.  He regularly popped up on social media to say that he was suffering mild symptoms and was following advice in customary bombastic tone.  We like his bombastic tone, don't we?  That's why most of the country liked him.  That's why he got in.  Better to vote for someone that you like that you think's a little bit of a baboon than an absolute nutjob.  Just saying.  Even this morning, Number 10 was insisting that he was receiving red boxes full of government business and was in touch with his team.  See what I mean, guys?  I mean, it isn't... desperate yet.  And to be honest, I think Rab will do a good job in his stead for the time being.  But what say you?  Let me know.  But obviously, with his condition deteriorating on Monday afternoon, the view of his condition changed.  With the prognosis uncertain, the government has taken a highly unusual move of asking Foreign Secretary Dominic Rab to step up to deputise for Prime Minister when needed.  I think he was probably one of the best options in my opinion.  If I was asked personally, I would probably have said Rab myself.  But who would you have picked if you'd have had the option to pick someone to replace Boris while he gets better?  Who would you have picked?  Let me know in the comments.  Talking on Monday night, maybe you think Blair or Brown like Piers Moron.  Dominic Raab said that the government's business would go on.  Ministers focused on delivering the plans to tackle Lurgy that Mr Johnson had instructed them to do.  But the Foreign Secretary seemed understandably but obviously shocked.  Well, he's just been handed the reins of a country when he had no idea that this was going to happen.  What do you think he was going to do?  Do cartwheels around the room going, woohoo, I won, I won, I won, I got it, I got it, I got it.  Jesus.  Now, this next bit is the bit that I wanted to highlight.  This is why I think that all of the elites and the media and everybody else... are terrified that they're terrified.  they want us terrified locked away and the prime example for that is this.  listen to this.  politicians have repeatedly said that lurgy does not discriminate the infection does not pick and choose.  with boris johnson now in intensive care it is abundantly clear that power is no protection from harm.  now that to me sounds like projection.  that sounds like she's worried that her power doesn't protect her from harm which would explain why they want us all terrified and locked away.  Less contact for them if we're all locked in our house.  In regards to Boris, I hope he gets better.  I really do.  I don't wish anyone bad feelings or bad futures because of this.  Anyone that does is a bit low, in my opinion.  Nothing wrong with dark humour, but wishing someone dead is just a joke.  We've all seen it on Twitter.  Something needs to be done about that sort of stuff, because it's not good, is it?  I mean, look how toxic Twitter is.  But anyway, I hope he does well.  I hope he gets better soon.  I hope Carrie gets better soon, because I know she had it as well, apparently.  I think Dominic Raab is a very good choice for now, and I'm sure he will be thinking of country first above all else, which is exactly what we need at this moment.  Well, anyway, it was a short one.  Let me know what you think in the comments, guys and girls, and I shall see you on the next one. ",
