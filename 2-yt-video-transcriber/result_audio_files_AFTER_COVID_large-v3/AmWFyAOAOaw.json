            "text": "In the midst of this horrific healthcare crisis, in the midst of this economic meltdown, the American people are demanding to know what their government is doing in response to these crises.  We were elected as senators, members of the House, to respond to the needs of the American people and all over this country.  The American people are looking around them.  They see the struggle for racial justice.  They see a pandemic.  They see an economic meltdown.  And many of them are asking what the Republican leadership here in the Senate is doing.  Crisis after crisis after crisis.  And what is the leadership here in the Senate doing?  And tragically, Mr.  President, the answer is nothing.  Nothing.  Historians have suggested that in the year 64 AD, while Rome was burning, the Emperor Nero played his fiddle.  At least he did something.  He provided entertainment to his court.  But here in the U.S.  Senate, Republican Leader McConnell and his leadership team are doing nothing.  Sadly, tragically, this is the worst do-nothing Senate in modern American history, and every member of this body should be deeply ashamed at the degree to which we are failing our constituents.  All over this country, people are demanding an end to police killings and brutality, demanding racial justice in this country.  All over this country, people are being infected with the virus, continue to die.  And all over this country, People are wondering how they're gonna pay their bills because they've lost their jobs and have, in some cases, no food in the cupboard.  If there was ever a time in the modern history of this country that the Senate and the House are called upon to stand up for the families, the working families of this country who are struggling, who are living in emotional anxiety.  We're scared to death about what is going to happen in the future.  If we are to reaffirm faith in government in this country, to know that we are seeing and hearing that pain, now is the time.  So today I just call upon my colleagues.  I know we have disagreements.  But let us understand the urgency of the moment.  Let us deal with the pandemic.  Let's save lives.  Let's deal with the economic crisis.  Let's put people back to work.  Let's deal with the issue of racial justice.  Let's fight to end racism in this country.  There is an enormous amount of work to be done.  Let's do it. ",
