            "text": "So, people are talking about Diddy dating an Australian model.  And we use these celebrities and you talk about know jeezy um lil wayne something about 50 cent.  i don't know how to throw dr dre wife in there.  i think you know whatever but i could see she looks uh mixed.  so i get what they saying but they're still in the black side.  you know you still.  you can't one drop rule when it's convenient right you know i'm still saying if y'all still saying making marco black his wife black but What happens is you hear these things when these guys dating out of the community.  This is what they do.  Well, that's not true.  Because what you're seeing is, which is normal for us, is guys who have been in multiple relationships with different black women and they reach a certain age and they just get tired of trying.  So they decide to try with something else.  It's not Like, these guys are like, they waking up like, I just want something different.  Like, I do know black men who are like that, who, you know, if she's white, it makes her spectacular off the bat.  Like, I know guys like that, but they're the minority of the minority of the black men that I know.  You know what I'm saying?  I could only think of three off the top of my head that I've met in life.  You know, but that's just, like I said, I know guys, but like I said, three in life.  So, but the other guys who date out, they've been married or they have a kid or kids with black women, whether it's multiple kids with one or a kid with two, you know what I'm saying?  Or they spent years and years dating black women.  And basically what winds up happening is they got tired.  And it wasn't that they were looking for another race.  They were looking for peace.  And when they started dating out, it was easier to find peace.  And people were like, what are you talking about?  Well, I was looking at Diary of a Tired Black Man like two days ago.  And it's funny how The things that were in that are still prevalent right now.  And you can still see the remnants of it now.  Where you have some women who are angry and they assume that, you know, if I'm angry, you got to be with me because I'm angry.  Guys are like, no, I don't.  You know, so that becomes a problem.  Because these guys are tired of dealing with angry women.  You know.  Also, You got to take into consideration that, how can I put this?  You get tired of the rhetoric.  You get tired of y'all are no good.  You get tired of social media.  Black women, you might know, but you're not dating.  Even they have their moments where they post something on social media that's anti-black male.  Like, I would never this, I would never that, and men of this, and men of that, and la-da-da.  And after a while, you're like, you know what?  I don't want to be around somebody that talks negatively with men all day.  Not all day, but I'm just saying, who has the propensity to talk negative about men?  And what winds up happening is, these guys are dating other women because these other women are nicer to them in public.  places.  so that's how it's.  that's you know when it starts and that's why it starts.  because i'm not i'm not about to say that you know.  uh non-black women don't have their issues with black men or they don't have their issues in their own group with black men.  also they're not going to say they don't have the issues of race and this that and the third because they do you know but they understand men better than sisters do in general.  because when you think of When you think of non-black women, they actually have a propensity to date around outside of their group.  I think it gets taboo when they get to black men.  You wouldn't be surprised if a white woman dates a Hispanic man, an Asian man, or an Asian man dates a white woman, or a Middle Eastern woman, or even a black woman.  You get what I'm saying?  But the women do that.  The Asian women date white guys and the Hispanic guys.  They do that.  It's just when they start dating black guys, like, oh, wow.  So they have a better grasp on men in general because they actually do date out.  Do they marry out like that?  No, not really.  Asian women, I think, marry out the highest.  I think it's like 40% of Asian women marry outside of their race.  But What it is is they kind of have a baseline for what men are across the board.  They don't have to put somebody on this pedestal.  You know what I'm saying?  And I think the guys get tired of it because dealing with people who are not content and not satisfied becomes trying.  And I think white men deal with the same thing with white women.  I think Hispanic men deal with the same thing with Hispanic women.  I think what winds up happening is people's American dating culture is a culture of trying to get as much as you can for as little as you can.  you wind up getting turned off by the person that does it to you the most.  So guess what?  Guys get tired of it.  And I know people are going to have a, well, what about women get tired of being used?  I get what you're saying, but then I don't get what you're saying.  Because you can't say sex is empowering you and then say you're getting used sexually.  Because... You wanted to take control of your sexuality, and you can do whatever you want with your sexuality, and now all of a sudden, because you've had sex with numerous men, you mad at men.  That logic doesn't make sense, you know?  And that becomes a problem.  And the other thing about, you know, when and why black men date out is some guys are not wanted.  You know, some guys are... are not wanted, they approach sisters and sisters not feeling them, so they start approaching other people.  And then they find relationships that way, right?  And then other guys are, you know, late bloomers in a sense, and nobody probably wants them.  But when they start growing into the man that they wind up ultimately becoming, then everybody wants them.  And now it's like, he makes everybody compete.  And the best woman is who he's gonna choose, you know, no matter what that is.  And then you got guys who have the means to go other places and be around other people, and they like women of different areas, the exotic thing that they talking about.  You go to another country, everybody looks brand new.  You're exotic to the local people, And the foreigners are exotic to you.  It's something new.  So that's one of the other reasons why people date out.  And then, ultimately, you come to find that you meet other women who treat men better.  They come from cultures that treat men better.  So ultimately, You get guys who, as they get older, they didn't realize, oh, this person actually treats me better than I've been treated in the past.  And you want to continue that treatment.  So guess what you do?  You keep dating that.  And then what you wind up having is a bunch of people who are upset that you don't go date them again, but they're not going to match the level of treatment or they're not going to match the level of femininity.  Or they're not going to match the level of catering to a man as the woman that you're meeting outside of your race.  So you're going to be like, hey, look, I'm not coming.  It's me, Frankie.  I ain't coming home no more.  You know what I'm saying?  So it's one of those things.  So I'm done with this one.  Like, share, subscribe.  Catch y'all on the next one.  Peace. ",
