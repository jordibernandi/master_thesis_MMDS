People told him that he would never walk again, that he had no chance of walking, and today a miracle has happened.  He's riding a horse, he's doing awesome, and he's actually asking them if he can go faster.  That is how brave he is.  He is full of courage and hope.  This is part of aftercare.  that we hope people see is that there is hope, and if Andrew could tell survivors something, he would say, never give up.  And not only did he want to come, but he also wanted those that he has made friends with to come.  everyone around him into a circle of joy, and we get to experience that and be part of that.  Thank you to all of you who support us in rescue and in aftercare.  They go hand in hand, and Andrew is a story of what happened almost six years ago wasn't the end of his story.  He is still saying, I have a future, I have a hope, and I have so much more to come in my life.  So thank you guys for supporting us.  Thank you for being a part of this journey and believing in children when they're at their darkest moment and they're in the midst of being rescued to the full completion of aftercare.  Yeehaw! ",
