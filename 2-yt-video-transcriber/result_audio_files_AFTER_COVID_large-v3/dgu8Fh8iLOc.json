She has two beautiful daughters, Eden and Autumn, and... another one on the way that we don't know what it is yet, but we are all dying to find out.

I'm more so go to books or passages that remind me about God, especially whatever I might be reading or studying in the season.  So for me, This season, I'm studying a lot about the holiness of God, the transcendence of God, the moral perfection of God.  And so a lot of what I'm reading relates to that.  And so one passage in particular that I ran across that was like, whoa, it's convicting, but it's actually encouraging is Jeremiah 2.5.  And it says, thus says, the Lord, what wrong did your fathers find in me that they went far from me and went after worthlessness and became worthless?  I obviously wouldn't tattoo that on my back.  It's not something we would probably cross stitch on blankets.  But I think it speaks to the perfection of God and the futility of idolatry in the sense of God is like, there's literally nothing wrong with me.  And so that encourages me to say, man, all of the things that I'm being pulled towards, all of the things that I'm being tempted with, do they compare to God in any way?  And according to this verse, they can't because there's nothing wrong with God, but there's everything wrong in a sense with created things because they're not as perfect as he is.  And so I don't know that.  just, it does something to me to remind myself that, of just how big and good and transcended and worthwhile God is.  Amen. ",

Well, hey, you started to answer this question a little bit when you said you don't always just go to verses, you go to whole books.

But what would you say to somebody who maybe during this time wants to open her Bible for the very first time and never has and is intimidated, doesn't know where to start other than just you know, letting it fall open and see what happens to pop up.  What encouragement, what help would you give to somebody who wants to start studying their Bible and they never have? ",

            "text": "One, resist the lie and the temptation to believe that you're not capable of understanding what you read.  I think there's many reasons for that.  One, it might be because we don't see a lot of women teaching the scriptures.  So perhaps we think that we're not adequate enough to learn it and then teach it.  Or it's just this innate, what's the word, inadequate feeling that you have that you didn't go to seminary or I'm not as godly as this person.  So how in the world will I be able to interpret this?  this passage or this verse.  And so I would kill that automatically and say that, no, God has given me a brain and by his kindness and his grace, he is going to equip me and help me be able to learn about him in the scriptures.  Will you learn everything?  No, but nobody knows everything.  Not even PhD professors.  Nobody knows everything but God.  And so I think there's a bit of humility that says, no, I won't get it all.  But what I do get, let me worship God with it.  So that's one.  Two, Prayer.  Before I open the scriptures, I am praying that God would help me understand, that God would help me to discern spiritual truths, that God would open up his words and help me see the wonders in it.  So I don't want to go into it with the assumption that I will get it, which is the other, I guess, extreme assumption.  of feeling insufficient, which is feeling way too sufficient, way too proud of your own intellectual capability.  But nah, I need your help, Jesus.  And so there's that.  And then three, enjoy yourself.  Just open up a book.  I probably wouldn't start in Leviticus.  I probably wouldn't start there.  If you want to, it's beautiful.  Just read Hebrews with it.  But If I were to encourage anybody, I would start with the gospel.  When I became a Christian, the first book I read was Matthew.  When I was a disciple, the first book I read was John.  I think John is beautiful just because of how it displays the godness of Jesus.  And I would just read it.  And while I'm reading it, I will be asking the spirit questions.  Oh, in the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God and dwelt among us.  What does that mean?  And just trust that the Holy Spirit will use his text to interpret his text and underline things, circle things that are confusing and just enjoy it.  It's not some rigid mechanical thing.  God is not grading you on how well you understand the Bible.  God has given his word to you so that you may know him.  This is an intimate practice of worship.  And so that's what I would do.  And when I closed the book, I would say, God, the little I understood, help me obey it.  Help me apply it.  Help me believe it.  So it doesn't just become information that you tweet, but it becomes a life that you live.  So that's what I would say. ",

And so there's this beautiful picture of he's way holier and way more beyond us than we can realize.  But we have way more power to understand than we even know because God's spirit lives in us.
