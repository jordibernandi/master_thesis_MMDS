            "text": "welcome to the daily injection program.  this is show number six and this is going to be an epic one.  i want to talk about everything that has to do with qe to infinity opening we open in the uh swap lines.  the repo market is going insane trillion dollars a day going into overnight and 14 days repo neil kashkari.  uh what's going on with the fed?  what's going on with trump?  he's going to put a hard line between the medical industry and the financial uh opening of the markets.  And then historical day for gold, historical day for stocks.  Let's start off with 112 years ago, 1908.  We have a very decentralized 5,000 banks throughout the United States, deregulated banking industry, and there's a massive bank run.  I mean, the depositors are losing everything, a line outside of branches.  People are panicked.  And therefore, the top bankers in the country, they send a guy named Nelson Aldrich, a very prominent person at that time, to Europe.  And they tell him, go there, check out their banking system, come back with takeaways, with lessons.  Two years after that, 1910, he comes back from Bank of England, from Russian Federation.  He says, we need a central bank in this country to be a lender of last resort, basically.  By 1913, this is passed in the middle of the night in the Christmas holiday, very famous story, the Jekyll Island story.  And throughout the years, there have been a lot of controversy whether or not the Federal Reserve is actually federal, quasi-federal, private, a lot of conspiracies that have been going on, assassinations that had to go through with it.  A lot of people say JFK was assassinated because he wanted to abolish the Federal Reserve System.  Charles Lindbergh, a very prominent congressman, spoke a lot about the Fed and ended up dead.  So there's a lot of history going through the Fed.  1971, obviously, decoupling of the gold standard.  But what I want to talk about is this lender of last resort concept because We had the drunk, the dead junkie, the drunkard central banker, Neil Kashkari, president of the Minneapolis Fed, going on 60 Minutes.  And basically, it looks so massaged and so engineered.  The 60-minute crew obviously were fed the questions in advance so they can ask the proper questions.  And basically, they asked them, What's your cash position?  We have an infinite amount of cash.  There's always going to be cash in the ATMs, always going to be cash in your money markets.  We can facilitate as much as needed.  QE, we can buy assets, we can obviously go to Congress and change some legislation, we can buy corporate debt, we can buy anything.  We are the lender of last resort.  So remember that because that's not the kind of talk you want to hear from your central banker.  That's the kind of talk that creates reckless, reckless behavior in the marketplace and they've been acting far more aggressive than in 2008, the central bank.  QE to infinity.  So open-ended QE means QE without limits.  They're not going to tell you how much they're going to buy mortgage-backed securities or stocks.  They're just going to buy it.  So that's a big, big change.  Open swap lines to Europe.  Remember that because that's important.  They're going to basically bail out the European banking system and make sure they have enough dollars to sustain whatever is going to come their way.  So that's the second thing I want to talk to you.  The third thing is the risk-off event.  And So in a classic risk-off event, what you're going to see is you're going to see the system can't handling what's going on.  In a classic risk-off event, people are selling stocks, buying bonds.  Not what we're seeing right now.  In this pandemic, we're seeing people selling stocks, selling bonds they just want.  The system cannot handle this amount of cash in money markets, $12 trillion.  So QE to infinity had to happen.  Otherwise, the system was going to blow up, literally going to blow up with amount of cash needed.  So every night, the repo markets are working at a trillion dollars a night.  That's absolutely unprecedented.  It's going to leave a pile of cash.  And this is before direct deposits to every family of four, $3,000.  This is before the small business loans.  They're going to cover about 14 days of salaries and expenses to make sure that we don't have a snowball of layoffs.  This is a big deal.  Then you got the primary dealer facility that the Federal Reserve is doing.  And that's where they're going to basically allow you to use collateral as anything, any junk or toxic acid.  They're not going to ascertain its value.  They're going to check out what the real value is.  All they want to do is keep the markets functioning during this period.  And this is unprecedented in terms of its effect on the economy.  Now, I want to talk about gold.  Gold's having a historical day.  It went from under $1,500 to over $1,630 in one day.  And the main reason for this is not only the reflation that we're going to start seeing and that's already getting priced in, but also mine shutdowns.  So about 23% of the world's supply of silver and gold is going to be shut down.  Mines are going to get shut down in South America.  And that's big because you know that it takes months to put mines back into production.  That's before we talked about the physical gold and silver supply.  that's basically vaulted a lot of it in New York City.  If they have a shutdown, lockdown, forget about that supply as well.  So you're going to see numismatics already trading about $2,000 an ounce.  Maples and eagles trading over $1,800 an ounce.  In fact, in the silver markets, I've seen resellers selling online for a maple or an eagle or a numismatic at $40, $30, $22 an ounce, even though the COMEX is at $12.  So expect mines to be shut down, mining companies to be very profitable.  but not the operational miners, the hoarders.  So if you go to wealthresearchgroup.com forward slash QE, I wrote everything about this, including graphs and charts, and then you have wealthresearchgroup.com forward slash over, which is a phenomenal report.  Again, a must read on this topic.  Lastly, I want to talk about tax exempts and buybacks, dividends, accountability from companies.  So all these companies are gonna get thoroughly bailed out.  They're gonna get either tax exempts or they're gonna get some sort of subsidies or direct loans, whatever it is.  They're gonna come under a lot of scrutiny.  That scrutiny is gonna restrict them from buying back stock, handing out a dividend.  This is not a 2008 bailout where they're slashing rates, giving the money away, and there's no limits as to what they can do with it.  This is the new economy.  You want a bailout, you want loans, you want money, you have to be accountable for it.  You have to be accountable for the financial situation, the financial stability of your company if you're going to use taxpayers' money.  That's a big, big deal.  And that's going to come in on the second rescue bill.  So that's big.  And that's going to make mining more attractive, more profitable, because you have oil very, very cheap.  You have the commodity very expensive.  So we're talking about gold or we're talking about silver.  It's going to be reflated.  This is a great time to be in the mining industry.  For example, the SLV option chains for the January 21st at $13, it was about $2 a premium.  Two days later, now we're doing this interview two days after That trade took place.  It's already 260.  So you could have made a 30% gain in two days.  These are the type of opportunities that are going to be there.  And if you want to go to wealthresearch.com forward slash gold playbooks, that gold playbook, it's an A to Z on the mining industry.  I also just published my first ever book and I'm gonna make it free, totally free for the next two months because of what's going on with the COVID-19.  So if you go to wealthresearchgroup.com forward slash book, you can download immediately an ebook, a copy of it for yourself.  I wanna talk about Trump.  So Trump is gonna make a very hard line decision.  If he's gonna keep listening to Fauci, the CDC, the WHO, the the medical industry will always tell you do not open do not open do not open.  that's not feasible and that's not going to happen.  so what?  what are?  what's the plan?  what's the federal government's plan?  trump is thinking this there are hot spots.  i want to make sure that in those hot spots we have enough staff enough beds enough space in the hospital enough equipment and then start to open the non-hot spots.  In the hot spots, you have to figure out a way to quarantine the elderly people and let the economy flow.  The United States is the world's largest economy.  You cannot make it stop, hold for weeks.  What happened to it?  Boeing stock is down 70%.  Norwegian cruise lines is down 80%.  Gap is down 60%.  These are the sort of... Collapses that you cannot have.  you're gonna have to bail out these companies because it's not their fault.  the federal government basically mandated them to close and You're gonna have to bail them out.  four trillion dollars has already been promised.  another two and a half trillion is gonna come their way.  the deficits that will come out of it are insane and you have to unleash the economic machine and and start weighing the cost imbalances of having ICUs flooded with elderly people or maybe younger people.  We just don't know.  We have to face facts that we have to live with a virus.  Every year, two and a half million people die of flu-like viruses and diseases.  We don't never talk about that because nobody stops the economy for that.  There will be drugs coming along.  There will be a vaccine about 18 months.  I'm not saying it's over.  What I'm saying is it's a two, three-year ordeal, but we have to live through it.  And we have to be healthcare-wise smart, and that's what I think Trump is going to do.  Obviously, after every American citizen has gotten injected with a check courtesy of Donald Trump, he believes that his re-election votes and re-election opportunity or probability is very high.  So that's coming into play as well.  Again, wealthresearchgroup.com forward slash QE for this podcast.  unprecedented report about what the Fed has done, what Neil Kashkari stands on this.  And I believe it will be the next Fed chair.  So that's a big, big deal in the United States.  And look for my update tomorrow because markets have just gone for a ball today with gold, with silver.  And tomorrow we will have to see if this is a bear market bounce, a rally that is going to be actually very painful for people and the markets will actually start going down back again.  Or are we going to see this really started to turn around.  So definitely let's just touch base tomorrow. ",
