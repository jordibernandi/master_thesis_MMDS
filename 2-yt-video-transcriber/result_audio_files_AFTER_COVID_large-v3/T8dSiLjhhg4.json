            "text": "Hey guys!  So I am trying to think of new ways to make other kinds of content besides just video essays when there comes shows or different kinds of entertainment that I'm interested in and I want to talk about, but I don't necessarily want to do an entire long video essay.  I kind of played with this format already when I did my Abby Mills video that I posted earlier this week, and I wanted to continue this by talking about Curse, the new Netflix series that premiered on July 17th and that I binge-watched this weekend even though I found myself intrigued and perplexed at almost every turn of it.  It is a Netflix show based on the graphic novel Cursed by Frank Miller, Bat Frank Miller, yes, and Tom Wheeler.  It is a reimagining of the Arthurian legend, but instead of King Arthur, the protagonist of this series is Nimue, the Lady of the Lake, played by 13 Reasons Why, Katharine Langford.  She is a member of the Fae and they are being persecuted by this Christian group called the Red Paladins.  We do his work today.  who are going and trying to execute a genocide, essentially, against all of the Fae, led by Father Carden, played by Peter Mullen.  And he has the Weeping Monk, played by Teen Wolf's Daniel Sharman, as his weapon.  and basically in the first episode we realize that Nimue she has super magic but her fey community shun her because I guess her magic is a little bit too real.  it's got too much flavor that makes them uncomfortable.  However, they all get slaughtered and Nimue escapes and her mother gives her a sword and tells her to take it to Merlin.  Bring this to Merlin.  And Merlin in this adaptation is played by Gustav Skarsgard.  Is he a Skarsg\u00e5rd brother?  Let's click.  Yes he is one of the Skarsg\u00e5rd siblings.  All right that family just produces talent because this Gustav was a very good Merlin I must say.  and Sebastian Armistow is Uther Pendragon and he is also fairly fun in this role.  Overall I will say that the performances are pretty strong.  um Devin Terrell who played um Barack Obama in the movie Barry plays Arthur Arthur.  why did I say that Arthur Arthur Shalom Rune Franklin plays Morgana and there's another and there's a bunch of other characters that show up later on.  some of them are like spoilers, I guess.  It really depends and I think a lot of your enjoyment of this series will depend on kind of your levels when it comes to cheesy generic fantasy, but also how much you actually know and care about the Arthurian legends.  And I will say this, the legends of King Arthur are interesting because while there is canon that the tales have evolved constantly over the ages from the original Welsh to the French adaptations of it to the more Christian leaning ones so the myths of King Arthur have always evolved.  they have always changed and ebbed and flowed and we have adapted them countless times from musicals, to BBC miniseries, to Terrible Stars series that only lasted for one season, to you know that Guy Ritchie movie with the hottie from Sons of Anarchy.  But the concept of trying to do sort of like a feminist reimagining of King Arthur has been going on forever.  There is a YA novel called The Guinevere Deception, of course the now deeply problematic The Myths of Avalon due to child rape allegations and crimes done by Marion Zimmer Bradley.  but before that was an issue that people knew about.  those books were really big in terms of having feminist King Arthur reimagining.  So this concept in itself isn't very new.  So if it's not very new what does this show kind of bring to the table?  In my opinion it is very much a YA with a lot of violence like it is has some very gory moments but it's kind of muted by the fact that it's really bad cgi like season one of hercules legendary journey cgi.  and you may think that i am joking good sir but when i tell you there's a scene where nimue is being chased by some wolves and i was like girl.  where did the budget go?  because it wasn't to the hair it went to the costumes and it was to these wolves.  Yes!  Yes!  I mean, there is one good sequence at the end of the finale with some magic, but that was pretty much it.  The magic is pretty mundane and the world building is very strange.  And I think the reason why it's so strange for me is because the fae in this series, some of them look a little bit more than human, others do not.  And I just felt like, even though Christianity is a part of the stories, it's a little bit more complicated.  And I think just always going to wholesalely commit genocide against, you know, magical creatures that play a role in these fantasy, you know, like, there's always been a fantastical element to the King Arthur myths that it was kind of just odd to me that there was this kind of this wild scale genocide being happening, like the Christian aspects of it were really interesting, I guess?  I don't know.  I thought the whole thing was kind of weirdly conceived.  And I think the issue that I kind of find is that this show does try to add like diversity, you know, King Arthur or the future King Arthur if he becomes a king is, you know, is played by a Black actor.  That makes Morgan Le Fay a Black actor as well.  And that's all fine and good, but race bending and gender flipping only really work if you are being subversive with the text itself.  Hi everyone, Editor Princess here as I drink my giant cup of coffee.  Arthur's hair is atrocious.  Like this is why it's important to have black hairdressers, because his hair looks terrible, dude.  It's like he's got like three struggle braids.  the back of his head.  Also something that I found out as well when I was doing the editorial for this video is that apparently in the graphic novel book because I think it's just it's a book with some illustrations Nimue is more racially ambiguous.  so Like, Arthur in this is just a sellsword mercenary.  He's just as milquetoast and silly.  Like, he's not very interesting.  Neither is Nimue.  Nimue is just a chosen one person.  And I think what's so frustrating is that I feel like we should have gotten to the point already where, like, we realize that just making a white brunette woman the protagonist of a series does not inherently make it subversive.  Nimue should be the woman of color like King Arthur.  you know who cares if he's white or black?  you know.  I think it's cool that Morgana is a black woman but like her character doesn't really get to do as much.  like her autonomy is really shaky because there's so much manipulation going on with her storyline.  I mean the most interesting character is gotta be Sister Iris who's played by Emily Coates and is like an imagined character for the series.  she was great like she.  every episode she's in she just is.  she is filling the room with an environment so toxic it was delicious.  um sister iris is like she's a fanatical uh christian i guess catholic.  yeah because they're doing it for the pope who wants to join the red paladins and and destroy the fae because she believes in god.  and she's amazing.  she's my favorite character.  she's so good.  she's so good at being despicable but i think it's just a very generic series.  it's a very generic series because it doesn't really have much to say.  everything that it's doing has kind of already been touched on in some way or another with another fantasy.  another adaptation like the witcher is doing the same thing like the whole fey.  human conflict is not a new one and they're not really doing anything new with it.  and what's worse is that they play with certain elements of the canon which could be interesting if it didn't feel like they were slowly taking away things from Nimue that made her a compelling figure in the myths.  because um in the mythology Nimue the Lady of the Lake is has like seven different stories But one of the biggest ones concerning her is that, and I guess this will be my one spoiler, so spoiler alert for Cursed.  One of the stories about Nimue, who's also called Vivian in some stories, is that... merlin is like obsessed with her.  he's obsessed with her he wants to date her really bad and she's like no dude not into it.  um you're not my type but he keeps pursuing the issue.  so nim way vividly like all right you want to keep getting on come and breathing down my back teach me magic.  and And Merlin knows that if he teaches her magic, it's going to end up badly for him.  But he's read enough Greek mythology to know that like, you can't, you can't fight fate.  So turn out, we'll teach his hottie some magic.  And she's like, thank you for the magic.  Boom, you're in a tree now, which I stand because for all of the women in Greek mythology had to turn themselves into trees and rocks to flee.  from a rapist, I'm glad that Vivian Nimoy was able to reclaim that and then turn her perpetrator into a tree rock.  So sometimes it's a tree, sometimes it's a rock, either way, it's a slay moment.  In the show, Merlin is her father.  It's that thing that they do with Ray in Rise of the Skyfarter is they connect the empowered female character to a patriarch.  that amplifies her already existing power.  So even from this change, you are taking autonomy away from Nimue's story and integrating her with Merlin.  and Nimue throughout this series makes foolish decisions that make it hard to root for her.  she's she's not an adult so i don't want to hold her to like adult standards but she's so quickly elevated to being like queen of the fae and the savior of the fae.  i'm like the girl can't even run from point a to point b without being saved like she's constantly being saved by people.  she can only really do things at the ultra most minute.  and i'm like you.  know what if you were like my girl you saw your teskino and just an ordinary school girl who didn't have no powers for the rest of her life.  and all of a sudden you get a whole responsibility and you're like oh my god i'm chosen.  that would be one thing right but the thing that will vex me so hard is that like the fae is supposed to have magic and yet no one is using magic.  she just don't know.  i'm just like so y'all have powers but then y'all don't?  that'll get me agitated because i'm just like how do you have this power that makes you a threat to the church and intimidates you?  that's all this kind of stuff.  but you can't do anything.  and there's so many sort of like characters that get switched over or do this or do that like.  they have a gwen three knight character but he's weird.  lancelot shows up.  that was kind of weird.  uther and arthur have no real relationship because they're not related at all At least not the way it's set up here.  There's a character that you only know is Guinevere.  if you read the Wikipedia page or like it, for example, for Mary Sue, we got the DNR and it was confirmed in that, but not in the show itself.  Like there's so many weird choices.  There's a character named Pym who's like, Nimue's friend and there are episodes about her that are like okay this is cute but like what's the point?  oh it's to bring in this character who we don't know who they you know a lot of.  it is just feels very YA fantasy but with more terrible cgi blood and honestly like.  that's not entirely a bad thing.  i will say that like i enjoyed this show for what it is and it's kind of bad but it's quarantine.  so you know everything can't be.  perry mason which i am watching and i am enjoying it is fire.  i think it ends in a place that's more interesting than how it begins.  but i do think that while i don't think that a female protagonist can't have doubts and and have growth and have an arc and have that be a big part of it i think that And I think Lindsey said this when we were doing our Q&A for her book tour, is that you want a character that is pushed forward by the choices that she makes.  And that those choices are validated by the writers that think that you are a smart character.  And Nimue throughout the entire last part is doing things that are only there to facilitate the next beat of the plot.  Like she has to do A so that you can lead to this big moment and like she's so unsuccessful every time like every time she succeeds it's by coincidence it's by circumstance it's by plot convenience not because she came up with the best plan for the situation.  there is one time what she does works out and it's only because at the very last second she remembered how magic works.  The show isn't beautiful.  It doesn't really have any great outfits.  It is super duper generic.  And I think that The Witcher series, while The Witcher has its issues, it just, it looks really good.  It's fun.  It's got, it gives you that bang for your buck, you know?  It doesn't, it's not expensive, expensive, but it feels expensive.  This show feels like, it's like, oh, do you want some of these leftover costumes?  The show is fun.  but meaningless.  and if that's okay for you then you'll enjoy this.  for me i'm just like i'm.  i'll see i'll watch season two i'll do that.  i don't got it wasn't.  it wasn't as good as the best parts of bbc merlin but it wasn't as bad as stars as camelot.  and i think as long as it's not as bad as stars camelot then it's already won.  Let me know if you guys like these sort of like 15 minute long videos.  I also like being able to talk about more topical things and just being able to throw in a couple quick clips and everything like that.  And, you know, I like doing video essays.  I am working on editing my LGBTQ discourse one.  It should be down at the end of the month.  And for those of you who do not know, on my Patreon, on the 31st at 10 o'clock Eastern.  Yeah, I don't know why I said 10 o'clock Eastern.  It's 8 o'clock Eastern.  we are going to be doing on Crowdcast a live watch of 10 Things I Hate About You.  I have it on Blu-ray, so it won't be any streaming issues, at least on that regard.  I will be, I'll order a pizza and I'll be watching it together with everybody.  I'm still trying to figure out how I'm gonna have it play but it'll be fun.  i'll be chatting and so if you want to join us on that it's on patreon and i'm so excited.  and after this lgbtq discourse video i'm working on i have moved up girlhood because that topic really kept coming up and being relevant to a lot of things.  So that's going to be my next long form video.  And then I'm kind of figuring out after girl bossing monarchy, what I want to do next.  So if there's any suggestions you guys have, maybe it might come up in a future video.  Who knows? ",
