            "text": "Welcome to the video guys.  We all saw, most of you have seen a variety of things that happened yesterday.  We've had a bunch of fake news come out from both sides but obviously the media are the most prolific in this because of course we know what they're like.  We had BBC News last night and of course the Andrew Marr show this morning talking utter rubbish about what happened yesterday.  almost completely ignoring the actions of the so-called BLM protesters who weren't there to protest, but instead were looking for lone men to jump who they could claim were part of the far right with who knows what evidence, likely absolutely none.  As we can see here, which I will actually show you, I can't play the video because some of them are a bit brutal and YouTube will probably take the video down or limit the amount of views it get which is not something I want.  on this video I want as many people to see it as possible and I want them to complain to the BBC for their utterly biased coverage that they have performed in these protests.  not once have they shown any part of these videos during any of the broadcasts that show gangs of BLM protesters attacking single white men.  so let's take a quick scroll through them here.  you can see there is one guy in amongst that melee there.  i'll give you a rundown of it.  i've watched this video about 100 times and that makes me feel sick.  but there is one guy fighting it out with about 20 of them over there.  10 15 20 there's a lot of them anyway and i will say for him he does give a fair old go of himself.  he's on the floor down there.  you can see him there.  he does get up there as you can see camera moves down and he's still fighting him.  he's not giving up.  He's still swinging punches, you can see it.  Big guy here, comes in, blindsides him like a big man, knocks him down.  and then they start kicking him while he's down.  BBC, not a word on that at all, as I'm sure you have all seen, and likely is not surprising to any of you, to be honest.  It's certainly not surprising to me, but it's things like that, that mean we need to really complain against the BBC, and as I posted the other day in that video, definitely need to get it defunded, given what we are seeing here, and you will see in a minute, from the actual videos I have taken of BBC coverage of this, overnight and this morning.  and here we have another one.  here tribal aggression hunting impacts.  look at them.  look surrounding one guy.  there is one guy in amongst all that they are beating on one guy.  what 20 30 40 people.  people need to be going through this and taking faces.  i will say there are a couple of guys in there i hear for instance another one behind him who are actually trying to stop him.  he easier to see in the full video but there were guys in amongst the crowd that were trying to stop the fucking rabid animals from attacking him.  obviously once mob rule starts which was all started of course by Sadiq Khan this is the sort of scenes you see.  the police come over to get back.  now you will notice something that you've all probably seen from the protests in London.  on the other side outside the statues the police the police here come over with their hands out as where when they went towards the protesters on the other side of the bridge what did they have out then?  riot shields and batons.  It's amazing.  the double standards of the police which I think needs to be done in a separate video entirely.  This is about the BBC and it's utter bias reporting and take a look how long it takes these coppers to see if this man is okay.  He is on the floor for a good 10 seconds after they get there before one of them even bothers to see if he's all right which by the looks of it luckily he is sort of all right.  but given the kicking he's just had by a Now why those old Bill there are not arresting every single one of these fucking people that are?  there is another question entirely and something Cressida Dick needs to answer quickly.  This guy here in the grey top he is one of the ones who was actually trying to stop it from what I've seen in the video.  so respect to him.  the rest of them are a bunch of dirty cunts.  And obviously, I will add on there, there were scenes of people still being people.  You know, not everyone was down there fighting and arguing.  We also have this video here, which I can show you of the so-called far-right racists that were apparently at the statue talking to a black man.  If you don't like this country, you leave.  Yes.  If you don't like this country, you leave.  If you love this country, you love this country.  Many of you have lost your family for the peace.  If you don't love this country, you leave.  If you don't love this country, leave!  Leave!  Leave!  Leave!  Leave!  Leave!  Leave!  Leave!  What a bunch of racists, I think you would all agree.  But you won't see that reported on the mainstream media, obviously.  They're more interested in calling football fans far right.  And I think I will add this on there.  It was definitely a mad day yesterday because Jess Phillips actually talked talked a bit of sense though apparently she deleted this tweet and then come out with some other bullshit.  but that is besides the point.  she did tweet this out and it was out for a little while.  remember that violent scenes do not represent our country.  go outside your house pop to the shops And watch how people actually are.  Which I'm sure most if not all would agree.  Is actually a common sense approach.  I wasn't aware Jess Pislips was capable of.  But I suppose you learn something new every day.  The videos that I kind of showed you in this.  I will actually add to the video description.  So you can go and watch them in real time.  And be sickened if you want to.  But the real point of this video is of course the BBC and their piss poor reporting on the subject because of course as usual they are taking the one-sided approach that they are always known for.  This is why we need to complain against them in regards to their coverage of this incident.  We need to complain about every single one of their broadcasts where they have shown complete and utter bias and not reported both sides of the argument.  These couple of the clips are just a few examples.  I have one from the 10 o'clock news segment last night and the other from the Andrew Marr show.  so some of the more popular programs seen by likely millions of people where where they have not reported the truth as is commonplace for the biased broadcasting corporation.  so let's take a quick look at these clips.  I'll go over them briefly before I end this video because there are a few things I want to try and cover today if I have enough time.  Every single paper and announcements from the government about things they might do.  Just take us through.  I think the front page of the Mail on Sunday has that big picture, which is fairly horrifying. ",

            "text": "Yeah, they've got the big picture and it says, what has become of the tolerant Britain we love?  Well, the answer, of course, is that what has been ostensibly a peaceful protest up to now has yet again been hijacked by a violent faction.  And this time, as we saw over the weekend, it's the far right.  And, you know, I really just think that the police need to really clamp down on this violent faction and get back to what was the original message of these protests, which, of course, was against police brutality.  That has now that message seems to have got lost.  And we have these.  well, I can only describe them as thugs dominating the headlines.  Now, it all sort of centers, of course, around the argument about statues, particularly statues in central London over the weekend, which statues should remain standing, which statues should be taken down.  And there's a superb piece in the Mail on Sunday by Sir Geoff Palmer, OBE.  He's a professor of life sciences.  And he says, you know, that history cannot be changed.  He said it most certainly can't be changed through violence and destruction.  And he said racism, which is a consequence of this history, can and must be challenged.  But he said... In terms of the statues, let's educate people.  He said, if you remove the evidence, you remove the deed.  So again, it just brings us back to this thing of let's have debate.  Let's have, you know, statues, certain statues taken down if people want them taken down.  by democratic means and not by mob rule. ",

            "text": "Well, we start off there with a clip showing a sun shit weasel talking about how we've lost tolerant Britain, which, no, we have not.  This is just Sadiq Khan and the media stoking tensions between people, causing these sorts of problems.  If Sadiq Khan would have kept his mouth shut the other day instead of running around screaming about far-right this and far-right that, the scenes we saw in London yesterday would have never occurred.  Knowing Sadiq Khan as we do and the snivelling shit weasel that he is, we always knew he was likely to do it.  The guy's sole job, it seems, is to sow divisions between people and stop them from banding together to kick them out of office while obviously pushing that they Party and left-wing lunatics agendas.  You will notice that not once does she point out anything the BLM protesters did.  She instead blames everything on the far right, which was actually, from what I could tell, just a bunch of football fans who went down there to protect the statues, but mainly by the looks of it, have a row with the old bill, which obviously didn't help nothing, and gave the BBC the headlines they needed to which is why I advised against actually going down there because we all know what the BBC and sniveling shit weasels like them would do.  You can tell her blatantly biased reporting on the subject when she says it's been taken over by the far right.  Has she seen none of the videos on the other side?  I have to wonder.  Since seeing this I did actually tweet at her with a link to the videos showing her the other side of the coin and telling her maybe she should start reporting the truth.  As to whether she will, I highly doubt it.  I actually expect she's probably blocked me already, much like a few other media personalities have when I've pointed out their utter hypocrisy or complete stupidity.  I mean, the only sensible thing she said during that whole segment was literally the piece in the paper by Sir Geoff Palmer OBE.  That, that is not her own words, she is literally just parroting someone else, she is there to push the media agenda.  but let's move on.  we actually have a clip now from the BBC last night which shows yet again more bias reporting from them in relation to what happened yesterday.

            "text": "cut out a bit of that report because they have essentially said exactly the same thing as we saw from Andrew Maher this morning.  there's no.  there's no point in listening to it again but they do get on a guy who is part of the so-called counter-protest or should we just say protecting the monuments.  He points out he's a South Londoner like me and he's got no issue with the stupid BLM movement, he just don't want these fucking idiots to run around destroying statues of British history.  You know, the common sense thing that should be going on, which the BBC and every media organisation should be fully behind, instead of running around screaming about how these guys are supposed to be far right.  He really looks extreme far right to me, I'm sure you would all agree.  But what follows after the man who was defending the statue spoke is some more biased bullshit from the BBC, where he runs around claiming BLM marches were held the day before and just a few had turned up, but they were mostly peaceful or some bullshit like that.  which we all know is utter bollocks, as I've shown there and you can see on my Twitter from yesterday, I tried to catalogue as many incidents from both sides as I could, because obviously the ructions with the old bill really do not help the situation, especially when we was all condemning the other side doing it last week.  Though in some way I do understand the protesters being pissed off with the police and their blatant double standards, as many people have pointed out, and I may well have to do a video on later.  or to Back to what the BBC shitweasel said.  He was on about.  there were some scuffles while showing a couple of guys apparently scuffling with absolutely no one because what they showed on the screen at the time was a couple of people having a debate.  Why didn't they show the many videos that I have posted from various people on my Twitter?  that shows what really happened from the BLM side yesterday?  Because I'll tell you what, it is certainly a far lot worse than what any of the so-called far-right protesters did, that is for sure.  Now, we also hear the BBC talk about what the Prime Minister said, which I think I will have to deal with in a separate video, because Boris the Soy Boy Johnson deserves to be called out.  For being a complete piss-poor tosspot who is just pandering to the lefty media and the woke cunts around the country, it is really pissing me off that he's running around saying racist thuggery has no place on our streets when the only racism that anyone saw was the other way to what he is claiming, if you ask me.  Priti Patel was a bit more nondescript in it but still lacked to call out the actual shit that was going on yesterday as I'm sure you all noticed when you watched it.  And obviously at the end there, the BBC shows Waterloo Station, which a couple of the videos that I scrolled through are actually from.  Funny how they didn't show them once there.  Instead, they showed this one here of BLM protesters kind of bouncing off the old bill, rather than bouncing one man's head off the floor multiple times, as you saw in those videos.  Now, they do also point out the number of officers injured, which was six.  Still too many in my opinion.  No one should have been attacking the old bill.  That is exactly what the media want, as I've said.  But last week, there was something like 60 of them injured, while only six this week.  Yeah, we get extreme far-right racist thugs are the real problem in the UK.  Is the BBC having a fucking laugh?  I am going to end the video there because the more I look through this bullshit, the more incensed I get with the BBC.  Make sure you guys put in a complaint to the BBC about their biased coverage.  Let's make sure they are forced to report on what actually happened yesterday.  We want them to show the videos of all the attacks that happened from both sides if they want to run around and scream about how one side was worse than the other while covering the actions of so-called BLM protesters.  Which I do feel I need to say, I don't think we're actually BLM protesters, but instead we're just boys from around the estates in London, spurred on by the Stone Cold loser, Sadiq Khan, and his words claiming far-right extremists were coming to London to start trouble.  This is obviously going to get people's backs up and send them out into the honey trap, which of course it did.  Sadiq Khan is playing for divisions.  He is someone we also need to get rid of, though that is slightly more difficult.  Next year, London needs to vote against him.  This is a campaign we definitely need to lead, I think, not just for London, but for the good of the country in general.  Now as always I want to say a massive thank you to everyone who supports the channel and my other social media.  links are down in the video description.  If you want to come and support me on Twitter, Bitshoot and a variety of other platforms including my second YouTube channel.  As I said all links are down in the video description.
