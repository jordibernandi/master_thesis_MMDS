            "text": "So this is video of Donald Trump goofing around during the National Anthem at a Super Bowl watch party in Mar-a-Lago with a bunch of millionaires who paid a lot of money to watch that with him.  Let's just talk it out for a minute, guys.  Let's just talk it out for a minute.  It's just really funny because everyone who opposes Donald Trump knows that the guy is a complete moron.  And this is just video evidence of it.  So for people like myself, it's like, oh yeah, of course he behaves like that.  The guy doesn't really understand true patriotism.  But if you were to ask a Trump supporter, Like, this guy is the biggest patriot in the history of our country.  This guy.  This guy.  The guy who pretends to be conducting an orchestra during the national anthem.  The guy who is at a resort in Florida with a bunch of other millionaires... Yet he's trying to present himself as though he's the guy who's fighting for the salt of the earth type person.  Like guys, he's a con man.  He's a scheme artist.  And this is just evidence of that.  The guy is not a patriot.  He's un-American.  He doesn't hold our values as Americans.  And for all you supporters who think that he does, like he doesn't.  And this is direct evidence of that.  The guy conducting during the national anthem.  Video evidence.  Hard to disagree with that.  Thanks for watching.  My name is Brendan.  See you in the next video. ",
