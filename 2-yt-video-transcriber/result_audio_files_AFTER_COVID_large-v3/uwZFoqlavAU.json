            "text": "This is the backside of the FBI, or the side of the FBI.  So this is right across the street from the FBI.  It says it's a command substation.  That's what it says.  They're already circling me.  Mr.  FBI and the terrorist hunting.  I don't want to have a conversation.  I don't want to have a conversation, sir.  I'm narrating.  What are you?  I'm narrating.  I don't want to have a conversation.  Well, I'm here to make sure that what you're doing, we got a call.  We got a call.  I'm doing a story.  I'm a journalist.  So you guys can leave me alone.  I don't need an ID unless I commit a crime, sir.  You're filming a nation.  Yeah, that's not a crime, sir.  It's not a crime.  It's not a crime.  And it's not a reason of articulate suspicion either.  Really, it isn't?  It isn't.  I challenge you to that.  You're being live streamed on the internet.  Hey, you guys.  Why are you going to challenge me?  Because you think you're just so up and you're going to want to see who I am, a guy with a gun?  I'm sorry, but you're not getting an idea.  I don't even have one on me.  It's my job.  No, it's not, sir.  No, it's not.  I told you I'm doing a story.  No, sir, you're overstepping your boundaries.  I already told you.  I just did the FBI, and they said it was okay, and you're going to come out here?  Who told you at the FBI?  That's why we got the call.  Yeah, I already talked to them.  Well, it doesn't matter.  I got the DHS memo here.  But don't come up and start demanding ID because you're not going to get it.  You're not going to get ID.  I just came out here, man.  You asked me for ID, bro.  Exactly.  So why would I... But why... No.  Let me see your ID, where you live.  Why am I going to show you my ID?  Exactly.  So why should I show you?  Okay.  Do you want to give me your name then?  No.  You can call me Good Citizen.  What's that?  You can call me Good Citizen.  Good Citizen?  See, you guys, I'm at... Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Station, the Larisee Bowling Area Command substation.  I was doing a story on the FBI, and I noticed all this stuff, this fire station, police station, and he just wants to show up and demand ID and stuff.  So I told him what I'm doing.  I'm just doing a little story.  I'm exercising my First Amendment right.  How's it going?  How you doing, sir?  Greet the public, man.  You work for the community.  We pay you.  This guy, I say hello.  He doesn't want to say hello.  This is how you serve this community.  Partners with the community, okay.  Won't even greet.  What's your name and badge number, sir?  BA10640... Which clearly shows that what I'm doing is fully illegal, so... Listen, I never came out here and told you... Yeah, man, but that... You know what, man?  You can't just... No, because you can't... I know, but I told you... No, it's not rude.  It's inserting my rights because one question needs to... Yeah, but I have the right not to listen to you.  Have a good day, sir.  I want to just get my shots.  I've been driving around.  I know there's a lot of crime, man.  You shouldn't be bothering people that are doing a lawful act.  Huh?  What, road cops that kill people?  What's your shirt say, man?  I like it.  I love your shirt.  What's it say?  I like it.  There's a gift.  I like it.  Thank you.  Got to represent, got to represent, man.  My son gave it to me.  You guys have a good day.  Stay safe.  Have a good day, brother.  Stay safe, okay?  All right, guys, I'm going to shut this off.  I know they're going to follow me, so thank you, guys.  I did the boo-hoo rubbing of the eyes as he went by. ",
