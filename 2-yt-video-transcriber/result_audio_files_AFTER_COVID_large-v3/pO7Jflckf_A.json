And that's up against dissecting frogs, so you know it's pretty bad.  Well, what made that happen, that eruption of stenchy bubbles?  Chemicals encountering and reacting to each other, producing various new effects.  Just like life, only less complicated.  When the Earth orbits the Sun, it's not reacting to movement, but to the Sun's gravity, which is creating movement through the force the Sun generates.  Movement is a byproduct of the interaction of spheres and forces.  And not just spheres, but that's usually how a hypothetical object reacting to a force is portrayed when people study these kind of things.  The motion of a sphere in a vacuum and zero gravity is often the beginning model for the study of the interaction between forces and objects because of the uniformity of the shape and its environment.  Without introducing an outside force, nothing will be going anywhere, and when it does, its movement will not be changed by its own shape.

            "text": "You say fucking what, when?  First of all, there are no laws of nature.  That's not a thing.  Or rather, it's not a thing outside of philosophy.  There are no laws of nature and boots on the ground science.  There are scientific laws which describe the topic.  she obviously thinks are covered by this term laws of nature, but they're not called that.  And while it may seem pedantic to make this distinction, because it is, it's also important to do it.  Christians love to take advantage of sloppy language.  You see it all the time if you're paying attention.  Don't even get me started on the crap they like to pull with the word theory.  And not being specific about whether we're talking scientific law or the so-called laws of nature opens the door for them to start equating things that have nothing in common.  And second, breathing defies scientific law?  Breathing.  Really.  She doesn't say how.  She doesn't say why.  In fact, her video is basically over.  There's 12 seconds left that I'm not gonna show you because she doesn't say anything new.  And I'm sure there are some better biologists out there than I who are currently gnashing their teeth as they furiously type in the comment section the reasons why breathing is more than adequately explained by science.  In a way, I kind of feel sorry for her.  Just from her mannerisms, I don't think she wanted to do this.  I don't think she wanted to be on camera.  She's acting like someone said, Hey Kristen, you're the kind of pretty people respond to.  Go put on a dress and talk to folks who aren't here for just under six minutes.  Maybe I'm reading her wrong, but that's the vibe I get.  But that's hardly important.  Far more pressing is that I have two long overdue thank yous for my Amazon wishlist, and I'm not opening those on camera anymore because people send me stuff that can get my channel in trouble, and I don't need any more surprises.  2020's been bad enough already.  Right, so who's first into the head basket today, eh?  No idea why I did that with an accent, it's just what was in my heart at the moment.  What we have is a collection of 50-plus Sega Genesis games ported over to the Nintendo Switch.  It's pretty cool.  You know, I mean, I'm an 80s kid.  I was raised on, well, actually Atari and television and then finally NES.  So obviously I'm an old school gamer.  And, you know, so having a bunch of stuff from my childhood is pretty cool.  And this wonderful bit of nostalgia-gasm comes to me about a month, month and a half ago.  I really should start making videos more often again.  From Rix.  That's R-I-X Rix.  So thank you for that.  I definitely appreciate it.  Hey, are you like me in that when you say thank you for something, it doesn't matter how genuinely you feel gratitude, you kind of feel like when you said it, you projected dishonesty, like you're just going through the motions?  I don't know how to say a thank you, no matter how sincere, that sounds sincere, at least in my own ears.  And next, but by no means least, in fact, you have no idea which one I value more because I'm doing them in the order they were received, is a Firefly keychain.  It looks just like Serenity, the spaceship, the Firefly bulk transport.  Yeah, from the TV show and the rather unfortunate movie.  No, I didn't like Serenity, and not just because they killed off my favorite character.  But regardless, this comes to me from Mama Atheist.  If you don't know Mama Atheist, you're missing out.  She's really good people.  Go check her.  Uh, and I'm not entirely certain why she sent it to me, but I have a vague notion or two.  But either way, I'm definitely grateful to have both this and, well, to know her.  So, again, thank you!  And if any of the rest of you wants to send me something, there's links down in the growing bar for both my Amazon wishlist and PayPal for direct donations.  But in no way feel obligated, and let's face it, it's a pandemic.  If you're spending money on me, you better be frickin' rich.  Cause, well, take care of your own first.  You know, I don't need presents if it's gonna be to your family's detriment.  Anyway, until next time, fellow space travelers, this is Bionic Dan saying, don't run on automatic.  Instead, please, think.  When you're rocking around, rocking around, walking around in nature, I'm going to do my best, dear viewers, to trim down what's being said by the living hu- Because movement doesn't come from other movement.
