            "text": "Justin Bieber's penis.  I'm kidding.  I'm kidding.  I would never do that to you.  We begin in Afghanistan.  It's just the tip of international conflicts.  We jumped in too fast, went in further than we originally intended, and now we're pulling out way more slowly than we said we would.  America.  Land of the free, home of the brave, inventor of Chinese food.  America.  The greatest country on earth.  You hear that, Denmark?  You go fuck yourself!  Yeah, I don't care what the World Happiness Index says.  Michelle Obama told me that we're number one and her arms make me feel safe.  Argentina.  Argentine tradition every bit as grand as the tango and hiding Nazis.  Both of which they are flamboyantly good at.  Australia.  an entire new country with prisoners, and trust me when I say, that is not a good idea.  Literally the only good thing to come out of that experiment was Hugh Jackman, and that took 180 years.  It was worth it, but it was a long time.  But it was worth it.  It was worth it.  Two centuries, but it was worth it.  Australia.  Not just the country where Russell Crowe lives, but very much the Russell Crowe of countries.  Azerbaijan.  A country you think about so little.  you didn't even realize that not only is that not Azerbaijan, it's not even a landmass, it's the Caspian Sea.  This is Azerbaijan.  Belgium.  The casual acquaintance France crops out of its Instagram photos.  Belgium.  Though Belgium does have one thing in common with Budweiser.  Historically speaking, Germans refuse to acknowledge that it's even there.  Bolivia.  A country you think about so little, you haven't even realized that's not Bolivia, this is Bolivia.  Actually, actually, that's still not Bolivia, this is Bolivia.  Or is it?  Or is it?  This game is never not going to be fun.  Bolivia, a country you think about so little, you don't even realize that's not Bolivia, that's Colombia, except it isn't, that's Venezuela.  That is Colombia, except it isn't, that's Bolivia, which is the one we were looking for in the first place.  Which one's Colombia?  There is simply no way to know.  Brazil, home of that one famous statue that I don't know the name of because I'm too embarrassed to Google, come at me, bro, Jesus statue.  Brazil, the country with the second most valuable Amazon on Earth.  Brazil, where even the Amazon rainforest looks like it's gotten a wax.  Brunei.  Wait, let me back up for a second.  There is a country called Brunei.  It's located here in Southeast Asia.  Specifically, it's located here on the island of Borneo.  Anyway, Brunei falls under the Saudi Arabia rule.  If you're a tiny, wealthy, strategically located country with oily business underneath you, the whole world is your friend.  Canada.  The country you think about so little, that's it.  End of sentence.  Canada.  It's basically five hockey rinks surrounded by bears.  Canada, the country with a thriving economy based on making jean jackets for geese and, of course, their booming sexy Ryan manufacturing industry.  Canada, what you get if America and Britain had a baby they abandoned in the snow.  Chechnya, the place that, when it shows up in text at the beginning of an action movie scene, promises you some shit is about to go down.  Crimea?  Have you seen the Crimean people?  It's basically this guy.  This is what you won, Russia.  This man and the entire history that his face represents.  And I just want to be clear that this guy is having a really good day.  That is what smiling looks like in Crimea.  And why shouldn't he be smiling?  After all, it's his 16th birthday.  Chechnya, a sentence uttered almost as infrequently as, man, I hope I get seated next to a baby.  China, the country responsible for huge technological advances, and yet it still can't seem to get pandas to fuck.  China in microcosm right there.  A gigantic machine looming over its subjects, forcing them to be more coordinated than anyone thought was physically possible.  China, manufacturers of everything except that piece of crap clay jar you got for Mother's Day.  China, a 3.7 million square mile panda fuck pad.  Cuba, Florida's teardrop tattoo.  Cuba, the world's least fun Castro district.  Cuba, or as JFK used to pronounce it, Booty Island.  Djibouti is a country with a rich cultural history and a multi-ethnic population of over 850,000 people, but you are right, it does also sound like a butt.  Denmark, you go fuck yourself!  Yeah, I don't care what the World Happiness Index says, Michelle Obama told me that we're number one and her arms make me feel safe.  Denmark, also known as wrong Norway, different Sweden, and that's actually not Finland.  Denmark, what would happen if a suicide note was a country?  Egypt, or as ISIS calls it, next.  Egypt, home of the world's first botched nose job.  A country where, from the looks of it, they still worry about Shrek attacks.  You know, that thing Belgium is in.  Finland is on all the good lists, like countries with the best pastries, or best countries to host your overseas lesbian wedding.  To drinking an entire bottle of red wine and then leaving the party with the host's wife.  France.  Country that looks at snails and says, I have got to get you in my mouth.  France.  The Frenchest thing imaginable.  A croissant sitting in a cafe eating a baguette.  Or maybe a mime feeding invisible cheese to his invisible mistress with a visible erection.  Spain.  Barcelona.  You are the worst.  The worst.  Gaza?  Horrific.  Germany, where the national motto is, let's stick to the present, shall we?  Germany.  A country whose idea of a bedtime story is two children being left to die in the forest before being nearly cooked and eaten and then murdering an old woman.  Sleep well.  Germany.  Who dares have the hubris to assume they deserve great wealth for mere excellence in trivia?  Beautiful language.  Just like honey off the tongue.  Greece, a country of and in ruins.  To Greece, the most recent Greek tragedy.  Greece, it spent money like a rapper whose accountant is Nicolas Cage.  Greece, the home of geniuses like Socrates, Aristotle, and this guy in Mykonos with an elephant-shaped thumb on his dick.  It's a vibrant country.  Greenland is icy, distant, and semi-autonomous.  It's exactly Trump's type.  Guam, the Pacific territory that unequivocally sounds the most like a Batman punch.  Guatemala, a country you think about so little, we're just going to leave up a map of Central America and make you look up which one it is.  Crack a book, I'm not here to spoon feed you what's Guatemala.  Hong Kong, the former British colony now back under Chinese rule.  Hong Kong is in an odd situation.  It's a limited democracy inside a communist country.  A setup that their own constitution describes as one country, two systems.  It's like the two girls one cup of governance, with one girl having a lot more control over what happens to that cup.  Hungary.  Yes, Hungary.  The fantasy home for every little girl who's young enough to love castles, but not quite old enough to be aware of neo-fascist political parties.  Iceland.  Seems in Iceland the line of succession goes Prime Minister, the guy in charge of the fish, the secretary of licorice-flavoured schnapps, a litany of elves that live in assorted boulders, And finally, anybody in a wool sweater who's feeling political.  Iceland?  Come on, guys, they have cars in Iceland.  It's a modern Nordic island nation and their English is excellent.  India.  And honestly, the last time a British person said that, we didn't leave for about 200 years.  India, or as we once called it, Britain's spice rack.  India.  It just narrowly beats out America as the country where a 20-minute lecture in this accent is the least welcome.  India, or as people with this accent have historically called it, mine.  Iran.  Not just the setting for 2013 Best Picture winner Argo.  Also, a country.  Iran.  The greatest threat to Salman Rushdie since Padma Lakshmi's divorce attorney.  America's relationship with Iran.  It's the Star Wars of international relationships.  Good in the 70s, terrible for a long time, and now hopefully on the brink of a revival.  Iran?  Let's say crippling sanctions.  Ireland.  A country with a slightly higher Irish population than the dropkick Murphys.  Ireland.  Europe's Boston.  Home of more red hair than Deborah Messing's shower drain.  Well, the less contentious spot on the globe, Israel.  Israel.  Drama-wise, the opposite of Canada.  Italy.  The country that gave us spaghetti, the Colosseum, and in a roundabout way, the guy who played Turtle.  Italy.  We all know the three most famous stereotypes of Italian culture are that they have close family relationships, they turn international negotiations into shouting matches, and they enjoy cooking pasta for dogs.  You know, Italians.  Japan, a nation so vibrant, not even Sofia Coppola and the band Air could make it boring.  Japan, Earth's pervert uncle.  Luxembourg, did you know that if you Google interesting Luxembourg facts, the result is just a page that says, no.  Luxembourg, what happens when you leave Lichtenstein out in the sun too long?  BAM!  Mexico, number seven on the list of things that Donald Trump is most frightened of, just ahead of Muslims and just behind the concept of self-reflection.  Mexico, or as you may know it, spicy Canada.  Mexico, the only place you can get a truly authentic volcano quesarito.  New Zealand.  We are not Australia.  New Zealand.  Now, you may know it as the homeland of Lorde, or that place where people who are happier than you go on vacation.  Now, New Zealand.  The country that, like a bad edible arrangement, is full of fucking Kiwis.  New Zealand.  The country whose major form of transportation is bungee jumping.  New Zealand this week.  Hobbit Australia.  New Zealand.  Australia's chia pet.  New Zealand.  Australia's Australia.  New Zealand.  Home of the planet's most worthless bird.  You are nothing.  Look at me.  You are nothing.  New Zealand.  Wallaby fuck island.  New Zealand.  If you want an image that sums up everything great about New Zealand, this is the flag right here.  What Olympic team would not be proud to march beneath that?  To Nigeria, the country whose prince is going to be sending you some of that money he owes any day now.  North Korea.  Earth's Florida.  North Korea.  Named best Korea for 70 years running by North Korea magazine.  North Korea.  Alphabetically speaking, the world's foremost Korea.  Norway.  You know, one of these.  Norway, the left testicle in the frigid sea penis of Scandinavia.  Norway, the only reason we have Winter Olympics is so you freakish snow people can pick up your stupid cross-country skiing medals.  Pakistan, well, probably drone strikes.  Panama.  A country you think about so little, you don't realize that's not Panama, that's the outline of a Scotty dog.  This is Panama.  Papua New Guinea.  That is unlikely a pairing as Sofia Vergara and Reese Witherspoon.  Peru.  Life isn't just a fairytale land of alpacas and pan flukes, Peru.  At some point you've got to pull your weight.  And don't give me the whole, oh but John, our population is the size of Texas and the war on terror is a hopeless geopolitical paradox.  That's bullshit, Peru!  Philippines.  The world's raw shark test.  I see an upside down feather and my father's disappointment.  Souls to the Poles, which is not to be confused with my charity foundation, Souls to the Poles, which sends shoes to Polish people despite the fact they haven't asked for them, don't need them, and have repeatedly asked me to stop.  Russia, a country that will continue to be funny until it suddenly isn't.  Russia, the prequel and sequel to the Soviet Union.  Russia, the future home of 45 million Ukrainians.  Russia, Earth's Death Star.  Russia, where despite appearances of the contrary, the cathedrals are not edible.  Russia, the real borscht belt.  Russia, the country that gave the world Tetris, merkins you wear on your heads, and potentially the 45th president of the United States.  Russia, Earth's Death Star.  Saudi Arabia, birthplace of the Prophet Muhammad.  The Prophet Muhammad.  Our graphics department must have decided against that one for some reason.  Saudi Arabia, the country with bans on pork, alcohol and porn, or as it's known in America, a Florida breakfast.  Saudi Arabia, the country that contains Mecca, which is like THE Muslim Mecca.  Saudi Arabia, the Mecca of Meccas.  Scotland.  Americans know it as the birthplace of Shrek and that accent you think you can do but actually can't.  Sweden.  Who hasn't spent 20 minutes in Ikea and immediately wanted to launch an attack on Sweden?  Someone has to pay for what I'm going through here.  Switzerland, where the national dance is collapsing from altitude sickness.  Syria, until 2011, a pretty nice name for a baby girl.  Justin Bieber's penis.  I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I would never do that to you.  We begin with Syria.  Much better.  Turkey, a country that shares its name with a bird, and not just any bird, the hottest bird.  Looking good, my friend.  Looking good.  Turkey.  A country, a bird, and the meanest thing you could call someone in 1956.  Turkey.  A.K.A.  Diet Syria.  Turkey is a nation in crisis.  Turk is a dating service that helps you fuck long-haul truckers.  Turkey.  The country named after the fourth best sandwich and the third best burger.  Turkey, the country that's always much bigger than you think it is.  Ukraine, that's a Libyan pool party waiting to happen.  Ukraine, a nation that, like the human appendix and your grandma Mimi, you only really hear about if something's gone horribly wrong.  Ukraine, currently Russia's fastest growing import.  Ukraine, or as Vladimir Putin might call it, Phase One.  The United Kingdom, home of fascinating wildlife like the fearless mating foxes of Kent, and beautiful mountains that go largely unexplored by the carefree mating foxes of Kent.  It's also home to some of the world's most gifted artists, like whomever took this picture of the stoic mating foxes of Kent.  Unfortunately, the UK is about to be completely fucked in a way not unlike the resigned mating foxes of Kent.  The United Kingdom, birthplace of the Beatles and yet very much the world's Ringo.  The United Kingdom, a place whose very name after this week's events is beginning to sound a bit sarcastic.  United Kingdom, where I am fondly known as who?  The UK, Earth's least magic kingdom.  The UK, the only two letters that promise more iciness and bad food than these two.  United Kingdom, Europe's America.  United Kingdom, the slightly damp corpse of the British Empire.  United Kingdom, America's deadbeat dad.  UK, where 2,000 years of civilization led to this face.  The UK, the country that gave the world the Beatles and then punished it with Coldplay.  Uruguay, a country that you think about so little that you didn't even notice that that's not Uruguay, this is Uruguay.  Venezuela, not to be confused with Benazela because that is the hot new celebrity couple that's just Ben Affleck fucking Avuva Zela.  Yeah.  He's happy.  He's happy.  You should be happy for him.  Venezuela.  Venezuela is the country famous for giving the world oil, seven Miss Universes, six Miss Worlds, and of course, most importantly, one Wilma Valderrama, who I like to think of as the Miss Universe of that 70s show.  Venezuela.  A country you think about so little, you didn't even realize that's not Venezuela.  This is Venezuela.  Actually, that's not Venezuela either.  This is Venezuela.  Except it isn't because Venezuela was the first one all along.  But the fact you didn't notice is the point.  Venezuela, aka North South America.  Yemen.  Home to 26 million Yemeni people and 27 million American drones.  The Earth.  You may know it as that blue thing Bruce Willis is always trying to save.  Or from its famous collaboration with wind and fire.  Or just simply as that place where George Clooney lives.  C'est tout pour ce soir.  A la semaine prochaine.  Bonne nuit, mon amour. ",
