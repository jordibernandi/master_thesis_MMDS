            "text": "A lawsuit against Cabela's could fundamentally change the retail firearms industry in the big box stores and maybe even stop them from selling them at all.  See what I mean here on this episode of Guns and Gadgets.  Hey everybody, welcome back to Guns and Gadgets, your premier source for Second Amendment news.  I am sick of watching the election coverage, I think most of the country is as well, so I figured I'd bring you this information on this lawsuit that could have some major ramifications, especially for those anti-gunners.

They will defend you legally in court if you happen to legally defend yourself with your tools of the trade.  So join USCCA at uscca.com.  slash gng.  Link will be down below.  So let's talk about this lawsuit here against Cabela's.  And this stems from a case back in November of 2016.  That's when a gentleman named Jake Klosick was house-sitting a friend's house.  He invited his friend over, and somewhere along the line, they had a firearm, and the firearm went off.  That firearm struck Klosick's friend in the abdomen, ultimately was a lethal wound and after going through the process he pled guilty to second-degree murder of killing his friend and he is serving a four to twelve year sentence in New York.  Now that's the backstory but it's what has happened since and more recently that Caught my eye.  And why?  Because it's very similar, different but similar, to what happened to Remington.  And we all know what happened to Remington with the lawsuits.  They don't even exist anymore.  So let me give you a quick rundown just to put this on your radar.  Now, if you're like me, you're like, wait, why Cabela's?  What did they have to do with this?  Well... Jake Klosek bought .45 caliber ammunition from Cabela's.  Now Cabela's lawyers are saying that although Klosek, who was 19 years old, both of the boys were 19 at the time, while Klosek couldn't legally purchase .45 caliber ammunition because in New York he couldn't legally own a handgun, It still should be considered legal because there are rifles that shoot .45 caliber ammunition.  So the court case ensued and the victim's family are saying that Cabela's, and let me get the quote correct, knew or should have known.  its failure to use reasonable care in selling the ammunition to someone like Kloszek would result in serious injury or death.  So that claim is an eye-opener to everyone that sells ammo.  So that could be terrible right there if it's not addressed.  Now, this case has gone through multiple levels in the state of New York, from the district level to the appellate to the state Supreme Court, and the case has been allowed to continue, and it's kind of alarming on what they're trying to tie together now.  Now, Judge Diane Devlin She is one of the judges who said that this case shall continue and refused to dismiss it.  She cited things from the testimony in leaning on her decision not to dismiss it that the .45 caliber ammunition in this case by the manufacturer and Cabela's that was being marketed as handgun ammo and also said that the rifle cited by Cabela's attorneys saying that the .45 ammo could also be used in a rifle, well those rifles are not legal under the New York SAFE Act.  So what they're saying is that by buying .45 caliber ammo as the 19 year old in New York, there was no legal way that he should have been able to purchase that.  because there was no way for him to legally own a firearm that could utilize it.  Then I went to the appellate court, and the appellate court upheld Judge Devlin's decision not to dismiss this case and allow it to go forward, and what the appellate court said is probably the most concerning here.  The appellate court noted that the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, that is the law that protects manufacturers of firearms, you insert name here, whatever, CZ, Colt, Glock, whatever, it protects them or insulates them from lawsuits regarding actions taken by an end user.  which is what happened to Bushmaster, if you remember.  The anti-gunners want everybody to think that the bad people, the evil people who are intent on doing evil things, do so because maybe the gun tells them to do it.  An inanimate object can't do these things, but they want to sue the manufacturers out of business.  And it happened to Remington.  Bushmaster was part of them.  So the appellate court ruled unanimous in allowing this case to continue.  And what they said was that the Protection of Lawful Commerce and Arms Act has exceptions.  It's not bulletproof.  Two which include negligence.  And negligence was part of this case as Klosick was handling the gun negligently when it went off.  They also said that they allowed this suit to proceed so that the facts could be sorted out at trial.  Now something just to keep in mind, and I'm not saying that this is the reason they're doing it or if this is going to actually happen, but hear me out.  Riddle me this, Batman.  This case, if Cabela's is held liable for selling ammunition, that something bad, terrible happened that somebody else did.  Both them and Bass Pro Shops who owns them will have a decision to make.  Another avenue is other lawsuits could happen all around the country where shootings happen based off ammunition that was bought at a store.  Well, where else are you gonna buy ammo?  So if this goes through and makes it to trial and is actually ruled on, it's not dismissed, it opens the door for those people who sell ammo to be sued because of the actions of an end user.  I believe that the anti-gunners, especially the ones who are salivating on what's going on right now related to the election, they would like nothing more than one of the last major retail box stores that sell firearms to decide to pull the pin.  Much like... Walmart did.  In 2015, Walmart pulled all AK and AR style rifles from their stores, refusing to sell those.  Last year, they pulled all ammunition that could be determined to be ammo for an assault weapon.  Their terminology, not mine.  Don't forget Dick's Sporting Goods have pulled all firearm sales from most of their stores.  They also pulled standard capacity magazines.  And if you remember, if you've been here for a while, you'll remember a video I did last year where 150 CEOs from different companies from all walks of industry penned a letter to the Senate begging them for more gun control.  BEGGING them for things like universal background checks and red flag laws.  So while I don't want to get all conspiracy theorist, where there's smoke, there's fire, and the links to the chain are there, someone just has to put them together.  So I'll try to keep on top of this lawsuit, just wanted to put it in front of you, maybe give you something else to think about other than what's going on with the red and blue states at the moment.  But yeah, this lawsuit, if it's allowed to continue and ruled upon, where Cabela's might be liable for selling ammunition to somebody legally, That's going to change things.  It's really going to change things.  So let me know what you guys think down below.  I would love to hear your opinions on this.  And what do you think is going on with this election?
