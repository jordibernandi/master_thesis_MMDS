            "text": "I'm actually filming like three videos at once.  I wanted to show y'all what $1,000 in ammunition look like and to show you the ease of purchasing ammunition online.  And I want to also show you a range day vlog.  And I want to also show you me testing and firing my Sig P365 for the first time.  So it's like three videos I got to film.  within the next couple of hours.  This package is actually 38 pounds.  This is a joke, a heavy.  So let's go ahead and get this open.  Safety first.  All right, I got some peanuts.  actually this is what i get paid at work.  i get paid in peanuts.  i gotta clean all this crap up all right.  so let's get in here all right oh goodness.  so in this little box right here More peanuts.  I have, these are my rifle rounds.  So these are Frontier 5.56 and it's 20, 62 grain bullets.  So I have, this is 20, two, four, six, eight, 10, two four six eight.  yeah i know they were happy to get my order too.  yeah over a thousand dollars worth.  so yes i have 200 rifle rounds here and then also in this box i have some uh critical duty.  oh these are hollow points okay.  so um these are my critical duty 25 round and this caliber is nine mil.  so 25 50 100 uh self defense or um hollow point home defender.  um nine mil rounds.  so this is great.  more peanuts all right and put these over here.  So in this box, I have... Where are we at?  Oh, here we go.  I have 500 5.56 rounds.  So these will be... Are these my training ones?  Let's see.  Whoa.  So yeah, this is what 500 rifle rounds look like.  It's more of these 20 round boxes.  So yeah.  So I have 500... And I actually have two of these.  And over here, oh no I just have one of those.  So I have 500 in this box, 600, 700 rounds for my rifle.  And then here is my Home Defenders.  That's 100 round Home Defenders because I got a new baby.  Have I introduced y'all to my new baby yet?  I will at the end of this, okay?  So the next box I have here is, are we, is this box upside down?  Yeah, here we go.  In this box I have 500, I know, I have 509 mil training rounds.  Let's open this up.  Yeah, here we go.  I have Centerfire 9mm 124 grain full metal jacket.  10 boxes totaling 509mm rounds.  I want to just see what it looks like.  Got this joker closed all the way.  here we go alright.  so yeah here we go the Winchester 9mm training rounds.  because I'll show you if you don't know when your round is closed like this that can be considered a training round for paper and these here they usually come in a smaller box when it is the hollow point that just means it has a hole at the top okay.  so that's what it looks like.  that's the difference training.  And then you have the hollow points, okay?  And yeah, and they'll actually say it on the box, because I know that they started labeling the box.  It will say target ammo, okay?  Target, home defenders.  Never shoot these.  I mean, I won't say never, but when you are defending your life, property, limbs, stuff like that, he used these, but for training, he used these.  Because these are generally, you get 50 compared to the 25, and they're cheaper, okay?  they're usually cheaper.  go about like $15 a box but I don't know right now with everybody in a mama owning a 9 mil and buying it all up.  so yeah also I was told to you know save your brass I was told that as well.  so yeah there we go.  so I have some training ammo so let's take it out of the box so that you can see it.  okay this is 500 rounds 200 Three hundred.  One, two, three, four, five.  Five hundred rounds, baby.  And we're all in this box.  And I don't believe that I still have the price for each one.  It depends on the packing slip.  Yeah, but my grand total was $1,075.66.  Shipping was $22 with UPS.  So, and then, but here's the thing.  My grand total was $1,075.66.  However, my product subtotal was only $973.  However, Georgia, Georgia tax, Georgia wanted $70 in taxes, alright?  That's what Georgia wanted.  The shipping insurance was $9 and the UPS shipping was $22.  But Georgia wanted $70!  The 50 rounds of 9 mil, the training rounds, those were $28 a box.  25 round hollow points, those were $28 a box.  These were $16, $16.95 a box.  The other ammo, this is the 556 IMI Systems Israel Military Industries.  These were $15 each.  So $15.95.  The Frontiers were $16.95.  The Training Winchester ammo was $28.95 a box.  I remember when I was paying like $14 for those.  Oh my gosh.  And then these Home Defenders, these were $28.95 a box.  Okay.  That's the breakdown.  So you can price shop, compare, and you may find a different deal.  You know, it just depends.  Supply, man, and all that good stuff.  But before we go, I want to introduce you to my new baby.  So wait one, okay?  This is my most recent firearm purchase.  And I absolutely love, love, love, love, okay?  This here is my baby.  Love, Georgia.  See, it's empty and clear.  This is a Sig P365.  I love it with all my heart.  It is a 9mm subcompact with the magazine empty mag installed if it's comfortably in my hand.  It's kind of like a cross between my 380 and my Glock 27.  Now I had to issue my Glock 27 because this finger was free flowing.  You can check that video out and how I fixed that.  But I absolutely love this firearm.  I absolutely love my SIG M400 and I really love the platform of SIGs.  So when I saw this handgun I actually was not shopping for a handgun.  I was shopping for an iPad.  And they didn't have any iPads in stock.  so I went and bought a gun.  It's just so ergonomically correct.  It has the non-slip grip.  And because it's a 9mm, it holds, I believe... It holds 10 rounds.  10 rounds fit in this.  Of course, I believe they call this style a double stack.  But it holds 10 rounds.  This pistol is so light.  And it's so small that I can comfortably concealed carry.  Now you remember I purchased my Glock 19.  And I didn't purchase my Glock 19 for concealed carry.  I purchased that mainly for my MCK conversion kit.  and use that mainly for, you know, home defense and stuff like that and to look cool as a superhero.  I love this because it's a heavier caliber than a .380 because the .380 is what they want to, you know, point all women to.  Like, hey, look at the .380.  It's so cute.  It's a small gun.  It's a purse gun.  Don't put your gun in your purse.  But, you know, they take us to that.  However, now with, you know, Kevlar being so popular, also with, you know, people, you know, just being on different drugs and stuff like that.  And in the event of an attack, you know, I really want to stop that threat sooner, you know, rather than later.  don't know poking them you know and telling them hey stop bothering me you know.  so i really want wanted a heavier caliber and the nine mil is really where i wanted to go.  i named all of my firearms.  so the name of this one i named it love georgia because it's the first firearm i purchased in georgia and i just i love georgia you know.  um i've been here for half a year now and I absolutely love it.  So I named my baby Love Georgia.  It's my first gun and I'm actually going to go shoot it for the first time today.  I really am.  I've been here practicing dry fire, you know, getting on target, coming from concealed, coming from different positions.  but I want to go, you know, shoot it today and I'm so, so, so, so excited.
