            "text": "The day I got cited, I was blindsided.  I couldn't believe that I was in America.  I left a place where that stuff happens, but not here.  Here, this is the land of opportunity.  I didn't do anything wrong.  I just couldn't believe it.  I didn't do anything wrong.  You think that you're doing things the right way.  You think that you're a law-abiding citizen.  And they said I was under arrest for braiding hair.  And they took me to jail.  They seized a little over $100,000 out of my business account here.  It took 13 years to get it and less than 13 seconds, I guess, to take it away.  I remember my attorneys telling me, most people don't win against the government.  Because I know now that we have more than just a chance.  I know that we're going to keep her homes.  If we win here at the U.S.  Supreme Court, it makes a difference for my girls and for so many other families.  I'm fighting back because I don't want to have a lot of other people have to go through the same thing I'm going through.  They're probably getting seized.  We changed the law so that everybody else can be treated fairly.  I want the opportunity to operate my legal business to practice my craft to meet the needs of my community in an innovative way and someone has to stand up. ",
