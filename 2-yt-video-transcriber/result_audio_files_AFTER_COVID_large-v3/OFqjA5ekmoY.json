Did the universe begin?  Because in the past, people assumed that the universe was forever and had different kinds of cycles or steady state or whatever.  You've been a little bit of a renegade in terms of the traditional, now conventional wisdom of inflation theory beginning the universe.  How so? ",

            "text": "Well, one of the biggest motivations of the scheme, which I've been putting forward, well, for about eight years now, let me just describe roughly the scheme.  The current view is that the universe began with what's called the Big Bang.  Immediately following that was a stage of inflation, which was an exponential expansion, which settled down for one reason or another into a more sedate expansion, which then became a an exponential expansion, which is what we see, what got the Nobel Prize a few years ago, the accelerated expansion of the universe, which I regard as a consequence of the lambda term Einstein introduced in his paper in 1917 for, admittedly, the wrong reason.  He wanted a static universe just at the wrong moment when it was about to be announced that the universe was expanding.  So he regarded that as his greatest mistake.  In fact, it turns out that it wasn't a mistake, but not for the reason that Einstein originally introduced it.  But, yeah, there seems to be this exponential expansion, self-similar expansion, if you like.  The rate of expansion depends on the state of the the size of the universe.  Now, this observed exponential expansion is what we expect to happen in our remote future, unless something else happens.  And I believe it will extend into the remote future.  Now, in inflation theory, there was a similar expansion in the very, very early stages after the Big Bang.  Now, I've never liked inflation right from the start for various reasons.  And I'm proposing a different idea, which is that yes, there was inflation in a sense, but this was before the Big Bang.  Now, an idea like that actually was put forward by the well-known distinguished particle physicist, Gabriel Venetiano, and he had a scheme in which the inflationary phase took place before the Big Bang, but that was sort of a one-off.  The view I'm taking is that what we regard as the current picture of the universe, but without inflation, without the inflation immediately following the Big Bang, expansion and then the accelerated expansion, is just one aeon.  I'm calling it an aeon, A-E-O-N, which is one of a succession of such eons.  So there will be another after ours, there was one before ours, and the exponential expansion of that previous eon in its remote future is what appears to be inflation in our model.  So there is, in a sense, inflation in this scheme, but it's not the kind of inflation that's argued for in normal physics. ",

            "text": "A good order of magnitude is infinity.  Because the view, you see, you say, how can it be infinity?  Well, it depends on how you measure time, you see.  This is an issue.  And the argument is that to build a clock properly, you need mass.  Now we have incredibly precise clocks now.  I don't know what the present record is, but if you think of all the time from the Big Bang to now, clocks are so precise that it's at least something like only a few percent of a second off.  So measuring the time from the Big Bang doesn't mean we know the time from the Big Bang that accurately, but the clocks would keep time to that precision.  Of course they wouldn't survive in the Big Bang, but don't worry about that.  Now this precision in clocks, although it depends on a lot of technology and so on, ultimately comes from the fact that we have mass.  Now we have mass in the universe, and ultimately it is just the two most basic equations of 20th century physics.  Of course Einstein's E equals m c squared, c is just a constant, so E and m, energy and mass, are equivalent.  The other great... The equation of 20th century physics is Planck, Max Planck's E equals h nu, well, f, or whatever you call it, frequency.  This tells you that energy and frequency are equivalent.  So putting these two equations together, we conclude that mass and frequency are equivalent.  So any stable particle is a clock, in a sense, with a very, very precisely defined frequency.  Now, the other way around is that if we didn't have mass, we don't have clocks.  And if you don't have clocks, you don't have a measure of time, you don't have a measure of distance.  In fact, the meter rule you see in Paris is no use anymore.  You would have to... Start, start.  Yes.  The meter rule in Paris is not a good definition of a meter anymore.  You define meter in terms of how long it would take light to travel.  Yeah.  you know, whatever fraction of a light second it is and so on.  So it's really time.  that is the thing that defines the scale of things.  Now that scale requires mass in one way or another.  Either the mass defined by particles or in general relativity.  we have another good measure of clocks from neutron stars going around each other and again just about as accurate.  you have another measure of time.  But that requires general relativity, and general relativity is a theory of gravity, and gravity requires mass.  So those are things which involve mass in one way or another.  If you didn't have mass, scale is irrelevant, big and small are equivalent.  So the idea is, Well, on the one hand, when you go right back towards the Big Bang, energies get so great that the masses of particles become irrelevant way earlier than the Higgs particle time, if you like.  Then the particles become effectively without mass, they're massless.  And so they don't have a way of measuring the scale.  Going to the remote future, almost all the particles around will be photons.  Photons, again, don't have a good measure of time.  So they don't know big from small.  So the idea is that the very remote future, and when I say very, I really mean right out to infinity, is like a big bang.  Now, that's a big, difficult thing to get your mind around because we think of one as stretched out and very... ",

And I think I was, to some extent, influenced by that, because when I got interested in cosmology first at Cambridge, that was a time when Bondi and Gold and Hoyle were producing this theory, and my good friend Dennis Sharma.  And they were all terribly excited about this idea of a universe.  that was always there, you see.  And so I think that rubbed off on me to some degree.  I was worried by how it didn't seem to make consistent sense with general relativity, and I think Bondi was worried by that too.  And when people decided, yes, there was a Big Bang, And the evidence for that is pretty convincing, and so I went along with that.  But nevertheless, there's something philosophically about the old steady-state model.  And it's interesting, you see, Einstein wanted a static model.  Newton, in a similar way, wanted something unchanging forever like this.  So there's something in us all, perhaps, which would like an eternal universe.  And so it has an appeal of that kind.
