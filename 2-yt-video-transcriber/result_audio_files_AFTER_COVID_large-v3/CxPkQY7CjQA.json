            "text": "Howdy, I'm Rob.  I'm a born and raised Texas Republican.  This will be my 12th presidential election.  I voted Republican 10 times in Johnson Weld in 2016.  This November, I'll be voting solid Democrat.  Now, our president is awful proud of the test he's been taking, and I have one for him.  On the left are the seven deadly sins, on the right, the seven cardinal virtues.  Let's see how he does.  Bluttony, check.  Avarice, check plus.  Pride, check.  Sloth, check.  Anger, check.  Lust, check plus.  Envy, okay, a solid nine out of seven on that one.  Virtues, truth, 20,000 lies.  Love, let's see, agape type love, not narcissism.  Courage, bone spurs.  Wisdom, have we still not flattened the curve after five months?  Tolerance, stars and bars, yes.  First Amendment, not so much.  Freedom, cages.  Creativity, well, I got to give him credit for hiding his taxes as long as he has.  In short, I can discern no admirable qualities in the man.  He is without virtue.  To my friends and family in the Christian community, You're good people.  You know the difference between right and wrong.  You know deep down in your Sunday school hearts what kind of man Donald Trump is, what kind of Christian he is.  You know, don't you?  You know.  Sure.  You know.  This is the last card in my little production.  It's mostly common profanity with a few phrases unique to Texas.  It expresses my opinion of the president and his GOP enablers, especially my two chicken shit Texas senators.  I think they're all a bunch of mis-aimed vulgarities that ran down their mama's leg and fertilized her toe jam, in short.  I won't share all that with you because it tends to run a mite severe.  Anyway, thanks for listening.  Now, go do something.  Vote. ",
