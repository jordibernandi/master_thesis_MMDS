But one thing I'll say, at the end of the day, when it comes to the SBS and the SEALs, I just think we have a bigger toolbox.  You know, we're good at a number of different skills.  Fortunately, the Americans do have a lot more money or budget for the military so that when it comes to, you know, they'll get one person to hold the rifle and the other person to pull the trigger.  But, you know, I just, sorry, but whether you call me biased or what, I just think the SBS are absolutely amazing.  And I'll put them at the top of the pedestal any day. ",

I think there's quite a lot of people that they join the SBS and because of the demand out in Afghan and various other theatres, I just don't think they had time to do that.  So although they joined the SBS... And, you know, it is quite a specialist skill, the SBS.  It's not to say we don't, you know, we obviously can do everything we do on land anyway, but our specialist skill is waterborne operations and insertion operations.  But in a theater that's not demanding that, then what are you going to do?  Stick people on a dive course or get them out into the war zone as quickly as possible to support the other lads.  So I think that was just circumstantial.  And I certainly know there's a few people saying, Yeah, no, I think you're exactly right. ",

So I did my first selection, got to the end, and there was a bit of an altercation with the Welsh farmer on the combat and survival, which meant that I got RTU'd at the last moment.  And when I went back, that was the old special boat SBS selection, which was we used to join with Hereford for the trees and also combat survival at the end.  But the rest was sort of done individually.  So then I went back after. ",

And then when I went back, it was the first, I did the second course, I missed the first one, I did the second course of the new selection, which is the joint selection.  But on the first selection, we used to do a thing called a portage, which is nine miles with a clepper canoe.  And that, I mean, we've actually got it coming up in SAS.  Who Dares Wins in the next, I don't think it's, I don't know if it's tonight's on Monday or whether it's next week, but it's coming up anyway.  But basically that is where you split the, you know, the bones of the canoe.  It's a two man military canoe, a Klepper, that you take all the bones out, which is the wood parts.  Someone carries that and someone else carries the skin.  And you had to carry that for nine miles.  I think that's, that's probably the hardest march I've ever done because the weight was just insane, insane amount of weight on your shoulders.  Um, and then what was it?  The swimming was the other question about, um, to be honest, you didn't, I mean, you had to be a good swimmer, but really, you know, it's, it's, it's, Showing a level of swimming ability when you're on selection.  I mean, the hardest swims we did was surface swims when we actually joined the SBS.  You know what I mean?  You would do a few K surface swim.  And also, you know, some of the ops dives you did, you know, some of the, you know, you only use diving in the SBS as a means of transport, as a means of transit.  You know, three meters below the surface thereabouts on a rebreather at night usually.  just following the compass board to target.  And some of those were absolutely hideous, but the surface, you know, subsurface was actually easier than doing surface swims.  You know, you do 5K surface swim, it's just hideous, hideous. ",

Um, and you could more than likely have an ops bag as well.  So you'd have like a, an Ortlieb bag with all your ops kit in there.  And, um, you know, sometimes, you know, you're swimming, you're just stationary because you're swimming against the tide and you just got to swim against the tide until the tide changes or, or becomes high tide or low tide before you can carry on.
