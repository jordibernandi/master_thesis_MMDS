            "text": "All of us here today do not want to see our election victory stolen by emboldened radical left Democrats, which is what they're doing, and stolen by... A twiddler with no proof.  Sounds like a horrible idea for a musical, no?  Or at least a horrible idea for a president.  Well, in just a couple weeks, he won't be anymore.  And whether you're happy about it or not, there are rules that must be followed.  Like my personal rule of not repeating a song I just parodied a few months ago, but you people won't stop f***ing DMing me to request it, so here we are.  More importantly, you ask, how does a desperate lame duck president and his bootlicking minions with no hope or evidence try to overturn an election they've clearly lost multiple times?  I can tell you in one word.  We will not take it anymore.  Sedition.  Sedition.  Sedition.  Huh?  Look it up.  Sedition.  Girl.  Sedition.  Sedition.  We had an election that was stolen.  Sedition.  Sedition.  La-la-la-lai La-la-la-lai La-la-la-lai La-la-la-lai La-la-la-lai La-la-la-lai La-la-la-lai La-la-la-lai La-la-la-lai La-la-la-lai La-la-la-lai La-la-la-lai La-la-la-lai La-la-la-lai La-la-la-lai La-la-la-lai La-la-la-lai La-la-la-lai La-la-la-lai La-la-la-lai La-la-la-lai La-la-la-lai La-la-la-lai La-la-la-lai La-la-la-lai La-la-la-lai La-la-la-lai La-la-la-lai Loser, the loser.  It was a landslide election.  Sedition.  Loser, the loser.  Stop the steal.  Sedition.  We won the election and it's not fair to take it away from us.  How could anyone defend the calls he's made?  It strikes on free democracy.  Maybe they would finally grow some balls if they'd Stop thinking only of their own damn selves.  Consider the evidence.  Ambition.  Ambition.  This is my opportunity to stand up.  Ambition.  Election.  Election.  This was a fraudulent election.  Citizen.  I need 11,000 votes.  Give me a break.  He says he only needs 11,000 votes to win.  He swears they stuffed the ballot box, but girl, they didn't.  Delusion.  Corruption.  Confusion.  Delusion.  Sedition.  Election.  Delusion.  Invasion.  Delusion.  Sedition.  The election that just occurred, quote, was rigged.  The Constitution clearly states it's time that he concedes.  Maybe once they lock him up, he'll finally learn to read.  Where?  In prison.  In prison.  Oh, I hear they do a nice spread.  TRANSITION!  TRANSITION!  Nobody knows what the hell is going on!  TRANSITION!  We will never concede!  TRANSITION!  TRANSITION!  TRANSITION!  There, I did it, ya happy!  TRANSITION!  La la la la.  La la la la.  Without sedition, his lies would be as shady as a twittler with no proof.  This was a fraudulent election.  Girl, bye. ",
