Hundreds of protesters came out in solidarity to mark one year since a major turning point in the Hong Kong pro-democracy protests.  And investors are suing a US-listed Chinese company for misleading them about potential risks from the virus.  Welcome to China In Focus.  I'm Tiffany Meyer.  A part of Chinese capital Beijing is under lockdown again after a recent spike in confirmed CCP virus cases.  The center of the cluster, a wholesale food market, is only 20 minutes drive away from Zhongnanhai.  the headquarters of the Chinese regime.  One district in Beijing has put itself on a wartime footing after seven people tested positive for the CCP virus.  All seven were clearly showing symptoms.  Another 46 people also tested positive in the same area, but none of them appear to show symptoms.  China doesn't count asymptomatic patients as confirmed cases, even though they can still transmit the virus to others.  The cluster of cases was centered around a market known as Xinfadi.  The market is around 10 miles away from China's seat of the state, Zhongnanhai.  Local officials say that six out of the seven confirmed virus patients had recently visited the market.  Authorities have since shut it down, along with other nearby markets.  Video posted online shows a large number of China's armed police force stationed outside Xinfadi.  Another showing people being taken away by buses.  Research samples were also taken from the market, and the virus was found on 40 of them, including on cutting boards used for imported salmon in the market.  Chinese media has cited multiple experts saying that there has been no evidence that salmon can transmit the virus.  Xinfadi claims to be the largest agricultural wholesale market in Asia.  The market supplies about 80% of Beijing's agricultural products and has over 15,000 people going in and out every day.  Local Chinese media say over 1,700 managerial staff alone work there.  Eleven neighborhoods near the market have been locked down, complete with 24-hour guards placed there.  Due to the new outbreak, Beijing has suspended sports events and tourism from other parts of China, effective immediately.  It also dropped plans to reopen schools next week for students in grades 1 through 3.  An update on the flooding in southern China.  Residents of China's Guangxi province are accusing authorities of opening the floodgate of an upstream reservoir.  Authorities reportedly acted to help discharge the flooding, but locals say they weren't notified.  They also said authorities have underreported the death toll. ",

This comes amid fears Beijing will strip the hub of its freedoms.  U.S.  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is planning a trip to meet China's top diplomat in Hawaii.  But media reports say the arrangements are not yet finalized.  Pompeo has criticized China on issues from the CCP virus pandemic to its Hong Kong policy for the treatment of its ethnic and religious minorities.  Relations between the countries have deteriorated in recent months.  An Australian man, Bengali Sheriff, was sentenced to death by a Chinese court after being arrested at Guangzhou airport.  He was trying to smuggle meth from China to Australia.  Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade says it is deeply saddened by the decision.  Relations between China and Australia have deteriorated significantly in recent months when Australia first pressed for an independent international investigation into the source of the CCP virus in late April.  The following month, China banned four Australian beef exporters, then announced restrictions on Australian barley imports.  China's Ministry of Education urging Chinese students to reconsider studying in Australia due to the risk of CCP virus and what they've called racist incidents targeting Asians.  Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison called China's claims rubbish, saying Australians will never trade their values in response to coercion from the CCP.  Students from two Chinese universities for science and technology discovered that they can no longer use a software program.  MATLAB is widely used by science students in China.  MathWorks MATLAB's developer explains that the license is discontinued because the two universities are on the  U.S.'s  entity list.  Any entities listed must obtain permission from the U.S.  authorities to use the technology.  The restriction has enormous impact.  If the two universities ignore the restriction, they can be sued.  For example, if their research papers use any data, graphs, or charts generated by MATLAB, the universities that are banned from MATLAB will have to begin an unprecedented large-scale process to convert MATLAB code into other code, and the process may take up to a year.  And another chapter in the Washington-Beijing rivalry, China has replaced the U.S.  as Venezuela's top oil importer.  This comes after the U.S.  imposed sanctions on Venezuela's state-owned oil company, an effort to topple socialist President Nicolas Maduro.  After U.S.  refineries stopped buying crude oil from Venezuela, China moved to the top of the list, becoming the number one purchaser.  According to Reuters, China imported an average of 350,000 barrels of crude oil daily in the first half of 2019.  The U.S.  tightened sanctions on Venezuela last year.  Any foreign country who does business with the Venezuelan regime will face the same penalty.  As a result, China's imports of oil slowly trickled down, but didn't stop completely.  According to Reuters, China bypassed the wrath of the US by making use of a Switzerland-based unit of Russia's state-owned oil company.  The workaround made it look like the oil was coming from Malaysia instead of Venezuela.  Malaysia is a popular transfer location because it's close to Singapore, one of the world's largest oil trading and storage locations.  Reuters found that within six months, China got its hands on nearly 20 million barrels of oil through this method.  Those shipments made up more than 5 percent of Venezuela's total 2019 exports, worth around $1 billion.  Those sales provided financial support for dictator Nicolas Maduro's rule.  Reuters discovered that the rebranded sales also continue into this year.  Now, the reports have caught the Trump administration's attention.  Earlier this year, Washington also sanctioned one of Russia's state-owned oil firms, which had been helping shuttle the oil from Venezuela to China.  The company denies wrongdoing, but the U.S.  is considering placing more sanctions on Chinese firms purchasing the sanctioned oil.  Due to the pressure, Venezuela's crude oil output has dropped by more than 20 percent this year.  It now produces less than 700,000 barrels per day.  But there are signs the illegal trade will continue.  Two small Mexican firms have caught the attention of the U.S.  FBI as potential violators.  They've recently appeared on the oil trading scene, shuttling oil from Venezuela.  Earlier this year, a Panama-flagged tanker carrying 700,000 barrels of crude oil near a Venezuelan port also attracted attention.  The ship belongs to one of the Mexican firms.  That vessel arrived at its destination in Malaysia several months later.  The Mexican firm has since declared bankruptcy.  Meanwhile, the oil is currently en route to China.  Investors of a U.S.-listed Chinese company are suing it for misleading them.  They say the company failed to alert them about the potential risk from the CCP virus.  Investors could lose as much as half of their money in the company's stock. ",

It went public on the New York Stock Exchange on January 17 this year, issuing millions of shares at $13.50 each.  The class action lawsuit alleges Phoenix was not transparent in its initial public offering or IPO files.  Investors say the company didn't tell them about customer complaints or negative press about its questionable practices, including signing renters up for bank loans without their knowledge and using the loans to fund its operations.  Danka operates in about a dozen cities in China, including Wuhan, the original epicenter of the pandemic.  The lawsuit also claims in the IPO files that Phoenix only said that its business could be affected by Ebola virus, H1N1 flu and some other flu-type syndromes.  But it didn't mention the CCP virus, or novel coronavirus, even though that virus had been spreading in Wuhan since December last year.  The company's shares have traded as low as about $6 since the IPO.  That's less than half of its initial price.  It's currently trading at around $9. ",
