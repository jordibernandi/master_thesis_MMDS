Today's topic and title is episode one.  Confessions of a cheating woman.  Subtitle.  She's in love with two men.  Introducing a new series here.  Let me know what you think of it.  Here we go.  Quoting a woman in a public forum named Candy Apple.  Quote, A few years ago, this was my situation, not being loyal and faithful to my man.  I admit that and I knew it was wrong, but I knew in my heart that it was with him, which was the man that I live with.  But the other man made me feel like diamonds, royalty, a queen, duchess and much more.  He let me know I had all his attention when we were together.  He wanted me all to himself, but I couldn't do that even though he made me feel like the world.  The world was mine and I was the only thing that mattered in his life.  He made me smile, cared so much for me, spoiled me.  He even watched me while I slept.  When I used to wake up, he would just be staring at me, rubbing my head, body and face.  with that nice smile and very romantic man he was.  He would shower me with love and much more like no other man ever did.  Believe me, there were sparks flying when he looked at me in my eyes, the way he held me and touched me.  He made sure that I knew that I came first in his life.  We laughed, we played.  I could talk to him about anything.  Friends before lovers.  He brought out the best in me, showed me what true love was.  But I was in love with the one that I live with because he was a good man, too.  And I was with him first.  Speaking of the guy at home, we were building a life together.  But on one hand, what the other didn't do, the other did.  And I couldn't have them both.  I finally got over that situation and got closure in that situation.  I'm never going to put myself in that situation again.  Close quote Candy Apples confession of cheating.  Now she decided to stay with the man that she was living with instead of going with the man.  that made her feel also great.  Now, let's get into the greater commentary and break down what this cheating woman spoke about her confession.  And in case you were wondering, that is a B-dub who made the confession a succubus.  Just to put that in context, right?  Sound just like one.  Now, I realize that we're living in an age where many, if not most, fee fails cheat, mainly because the average fee fail cannot focus on one man because she has so many options.  Why would she consider being with just one man?  How can she even focus on just one man when there are so many men in her DMs and her inboxes approaching her on the street at work trying to get her attention?  Her options are overwhelming.  Difficult choice for a strumpet to make to deal with just one guy.  Yo girl is being bombarded daily with offers from men to be a better boyfriend than you.  It's rough out there.  The way these SIMPs treat these HOs, you would think that there are.  More guys than gals out here.  Although the opposite is true, but the thirst is so real, nobody's girl is safe out here when it comes to these SIMPs, right?  Everybody trying to get a shot, treating even a below average looking female like a superstar and celebrity.  I said this before, bears repeating, I knew of a woman who had to get off Tinder or it may have been Bumble because she was overwhelmed with request.  now I know the wall is real.  you know the wall is real but this was a 40 plus year old fee fail who was about average or a little bit below average looks depending on who you are and even she was overwhelmed by her choices.  think about it.  now.  let's jump into the forum the post miss candy apple.  let's talk about her for a moment.  her boyfriend The guy she lived with, the main guy, mostly or most likely I'd say did not know about her affair because like the average succubus, she's a master of deception, a great but typical fee fail skill.  Most guys will never know what their girl is doing.  Most guys will never know or even believe that their girl is messing around because most guys believe that they have found the only woman on the planet the one woman on the planet who would not cheat on them.  in their minds.  all other females might be cheaters but not his girl.  this keeps a man blinded.  he's lying and deluding himself just like fee fails often do.  now her guy the main guy.  they live together and yet she was able to do all of these things.  she was able to experience all of these things with another man.  she was able to have all of these feelings for another man although she had a guy the main guy in who she was living with.  And despite all of these feelings and experiences, she was still able to come home with the man she lived with and deal with him be with him like nothing ever happened like nothing was going on.  I bet she didn't miss a beat with the man that she lived with.  I bet he didn't suspect a thing.  masters of deceit is what the creature is.  how can you compete with such?  She went home to the man she loved, but returned back out there to the streets to the man she loved, a different man, loving another man, loving two men.  One at home, one out there, loving them both, at least in her mind.  And that is cold right there.  In love with two.  She believed that she loved two guys and had extremely deep emotions for both.  This is why you should never, ever, ever trust.  a fee fails feelings because our feelings can be all over the place.  She can have feelings for you, have feelings for me, have feelings for him, have feelings for them.  I know most guys don't believe that because us as men, our ego blinds us.  I know you think you're the best, but she told me the same thing and you believed her.  And so did I. But now we should know better.  Now the other guy, the side guy, treated her like a queen.  Spoiled her, as she said, basically worshipped the ground that she walked on.  This shows in detail how she loves to be worshipped and that she'll fall in love through worship.  However, this worship wasn't enough to keep her with him or to pull her from the main guy.  And yes, I'm saying this.  about her and the side guy.  Although you may say the reason why she didn't end up with the side guy was because she was with the main guy first.  And although this may be true, what I'm saying here is that you can give a fee fail the world and that still won't be enough.  And the reason why that's key is because most fee fails have another guy somewhere.  So the same situation applies to you and your girl.  It's her world today.  any guy that she deals with long term short term in the past present in the future Most likely any man, every man that she deals with will have to compete knowingly or unknowingly with another man in her life.  Think about that.  She stated that both men were extremely good to her.  The one she was living with was the man in her life and who she was building a life with, which is what many fee fails claim to want so badly.  The guy living at home with her was basically everything that she wanted, everything that she'd asked for until the other guy came along.  And then when the other guy came along, Then she realized that she was missing something.  Typical fee fail thinking, right?  You had a guy that's great to you, guy that's wonderful building a life together.  But now all of a sudden this guy enters in the side guy.  Now you realize that there's something missing.  She didn't know she was missing it until she found it in another.  A confused mess.  Yes.  Again, such is the mind of the creature.  Chaotic, right?  You cannot trust the mind or the heart of a succubus.  And again, to her own admission, the guy that she was living with was great.  She loved him, but she still wanted someone else.  How could she still want someone else?  That's the question.  And of course, the obvious answer is that she's insatiable.  She's greedy, never satisfied and always believes that the grass is greener on the other side.  She wants to know desperately if the next guy will be greater than the current guy.  Will the next guy treat her better than the last guy or the current guy?  And most of all, she wants to check and constantly make sure that the guy in front of her is the best that she can do.  Because in her mind, she's always asking herself, is this the best that I can do?  Is there a better man out there to serve me?  She thinks.  But this is the creature that you love, right?  This is the creature that you're trying to self-improve and increase your value for, right?  This is the creature that you're trying to make wifey, right?  That's why you in the gym.  That's why you're making your money for a creature like this.  She mentioned that she was building a life with the main guy, but that wasn't enough.  Neither are you.  But because of your ego, you want to think and believe.  Yet you are so great, but there's nothing wrong with you.  There's something wrong with her.  And your esteem is so low that you are willing to take a chance with something that's destined to fail.  But you have every right to chase waterfalls, my friend.  She was being treated well by two men, two men that were investing their all into her, two men that desperately wanted her, two men that put her first, two men and whose goal was to make her happy, two men that deeply loves her.  But she rewarded both of those men, rewarded their kindness, rewarded their passion, Rewarded their actions toward her by cheating, rewarded both of them by dealing with both of them, because in her mind and in the mind of those men, she's the prize, right?  This is what society is.  This is what the dating coaches are telling you, right?  She is the prize.  And you believe such rhetoric, don't you?  Black Room 313 is a different type of dating coach.  The dating coach who has your best interest in mind, not hers.  Both of these men were trying to give her the world.  Although she's nothing but a cheater and an HO.  And yes, this is your girl too.  Many of you, many of us are giving our best to a streetwalker, also known as the modern fee fail, who is no different than the streetwalker.  She ended up staying with the guy that she was living with, the main guy and leaving the other guy that she had so much love and such passion for.  The side guy by no means was the victim.  However, he did invest greatly in her.  And now he's left with just his feelings for her because he's without her.  But again, he's no victim, but no less possibly hurt by the situation.  Now, of course, and obviously the victim here, the loser, I should say, here is the guy that she was living with.  the main guy because he probably has no idea what his woman was doing.  Probably had no idea about how she felt with another man.  I bet she probably pressured him and prodded him into living with her, into possibly marrying her.  But then she cheats on him, right?  This woman, this cheating woman in who I'm sure that he would probably risk his life for, sacrifice his life for.  live his life for was living her life with another man while she was with him.  think about that.  the fee fail that you would protect with your life is living her life with another man who feels the same way.  guys out here man losing because every guy thinks that his girl is the one and only good girl out there.  And it's true because my girl wouldn't do that, but yours would.  But the odds are that most fee fails cheat the vast majority.  Therefore, what are the odds that your girl is a cheater to very high?  Logically, right?  But we won't admit that.  This is why it's best to stay single because single guys don't get cheated on.  Hashtag winning.  But both relationships that she had with the main and the side guy, Miss Candy Apple, those relationships were a fraud and a lie.  And the main guy will never know the type of woman that he's laying next to right now.  He will never truly know her.  And there are guys on YouTube sitting up here telling you to always be honest with the modern fee fail, to be honest with such an evil.  Sick, deceitful, conniving, wicked, lying and cheating creature.  And this is where I differ.  I say if you're going to deal with them, the best way to deal with them is to keep it casual and occasional.  pump and let her dump the catch and release method by black ram.  three one three because we don't date we recreate we treat them for what they are worth which is next to nothing.  speaking of the succubus Like the video, sub to the channel, hit the notification button.
