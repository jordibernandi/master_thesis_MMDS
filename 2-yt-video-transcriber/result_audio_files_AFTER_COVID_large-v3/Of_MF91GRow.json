            "text": "So all of these big-name teachers that are out there, these false teachers, these TV charlatans, if you will, the TBN guys, what do you do with these guys?  when you've tried to help them, you've tried to give them Bible truth, but they have so fully embraced a lie that it's almost like the truth becomes offensive.  The truth becomes their enemy.  What do you do with guys like that?  Well, You try maybe once or twice, and the Bible says to reject these men.  Because while you're wasting all your time trying to convert these guys who won't listen, there's a whole other world filled with people out there who will listen.  Hey guys, your friend Spencer here.  Something happened this week, came across my social media feed, and I thought it was a notable incident.  And very interesting, Costi Hinn, the nephew of Benny Hinn, who of course came out of the prosperity gospel crowd and has come to more of an orthodox position.  on biblical Christianity, sent a copy of the movie The American Gospel to Todd White and apparently sent it with a letter, a very loving letter saying, hey, I love you and praying for you.  Please, would you watch this and reconsider your theological positions, which is a commendable thing to do.  And I think that was a good move.  You know, Costi seems to have all the connections in that crowd.  He was raised in that crowd and now has come out of it.  But I want you to see how Todd White, openly and publicly responded to that event.  And I want to play this video for you here at this time.  But before we do that, I want you to see this, that there are men in the Bible.  The Bible uses the word reprobate four times.  Jeremiah 630 is the first mention of the word reprobate in the Bible.  Reprobate silver shall men call them because the Lord hath rejected them.  So We invoke the law of first mention right there, and we understand that if that'd be the understanding of that in the first mention of the Bible, of the word reprobate, so it should be that way all the way through.  Romans 128 says, even though they did not retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient.  And then also it says there in 2 Timothy 3.8, It talks about that these Janus and Jambres withstood Moses.  So do these also resist the truth.  Men of corrupt minds reprobate concerning the faith.  You understand Janus and Jambres are the two guys that Moses did before Pharaoh and threw his rod down.  His rod became a snake.  Well, those two other Egyptian sorcerers, they threw their rods down.  They could do the same thing.  Those were the Kenneth Copelands of their day.  You know, Moses being, of course, the fundamentalist, if I can presume that as much.  And These guys were, you know, they were the apostate, false signs and wonders guys of their day.  And so that's something I want you to notice when we talk about this kind of stuff, that there are men, not only immoral men, Romans 1 talks about men that are so immoral that have so embraced their immorality that God just gave them over to it.  But it also, 2 Timothy chapter 3, there are men who have so embraced a false religion that God just gave them over to it.  God just said, okay, that's fine.  You can have that.  Reprobate concerning the faith, meaning that God has just rejected them because they rejected God.  Now, I want to play this video for you because it's very interesting how Todd White reacted to this.  I'm going to play this for you here at this time. ",

And he said, I've been listening to these different messages of different people and man, my buddy, I have a friend of mine that actually was director and he actually made a movie.  and you know, it's a movie and you're in it and I know what it is.  And it's a demonically inspired movie.  Why are you doing  this?\".  Well, you know, I'm doing this in love.  I really love you.  I said, you don't love me.  You're handing this to me and other people pointing out that I'm a heretic.  How can you say that?  Kosti Hinn is one of Benny's relatives.  MacArthur, MacArthur brought Kosti in.  One of Benny's, like, closest relatives.  And switched him around.  And now Kosti is working for MacArthur.  going after everything trying to expose as much as he can.  so they just made a really well done movie at the cost of the anointing.  so he hands me this letter and he wrote a letter to you and he wants you.  it's done in love.  I read it. ",

            "text": "Now, this is not my attempt to endorse the American gospel movie.  I have not seen the American gospel.  I am familiar with most of the men that are in it, and they are neo-evangelical men, conservative neo-evangelical men.  And of course, I've explained my position where I'm not a modernist and I'm not a neo evangelical.  I'm more of a fundamentalist type position.  And and really a lot of the theological battles are that are going on today are modernist fighting neo evangelicals.  And that's what this whole entire thing is.  It's it's.  it's very, you know, it's it's really it's.  It's very interesting to watch.  But did you notice how Todd White reacted to that?  He threw it away.  He tore up the DVD.  And man, just react is so hostile.  People don't realize this, but I have actually heard Todd White say that if you don't love him and you don't love Kenneth Copeland, then you're going to hell.  I've heard him say that.  He says if you do not like him or Kenneth Copeland, you have no relationship with the Holy Spirit and you're not even saved.  This man is a raging psychopath.  Todd White is a false teacher of the worst kind.  If you follow Todd White, I want to strongly admonish you to reconsider that.  This man is a complete theological train wreck.  I mean, he's one of the guys at the top of the food chain in that world.  He, for some reason, now years ago, Brian Welch of Korn got saved.  And that was notable to me because as a teenager, I liked Korn.  I liked their albums.  I listened to that stuff.  When I got saved, God cleaned my life up and got me out of all that.  Well, Brian Welch came to Christ apparently, and now he runs around with Todd White going to these Korn concerts asking Jesus to possess you.  That scares me to death, that terminology.  That absolutely unnerves me.  that somebody would word it that way.  Come on, we're gonna ask Jesus to possess us.  You can count me out.  I'm not into all that kind of stuff.  And so I guess what Kostya's trying to do is just trying to reach out to these people.  He's in the American Gospel Train, which those guys are very heavily Reformed.  John MacArthur and all those guys are Reformed.  I am not in those circles, and this is not my video endorsing that.  But I do think that... They largely hold an Orthodox view on Scripture.  Largely Orthodox, of course, not, of course, when they're Reformed.  I am not Reformed, and I have made no attempt to hide that on this channel.  But I think it's notable how Todd White acted towards that.  the anger that he showed openly about that.  And the reason is because he is reprobate concerning the faith, in my opinion.  Now, most people today would say, well, that was not a good move.  What you just need to do is you just need to pray for these guys.  You don't need to expose false teachers.  You just need to pray for these guys.  And you can say what you want to, but when I hear people say, well, I don't call them out.  I just pray for them.  I know instantly that you're just a coward.  And you're hiding your cowardice behind a facade of love.  I want you to know that a praying Christian is a bold Christian.  And we have people today that are just these feckless cowards, if you will.  And they don't want to call out these Todd Whites and the Benny Hens and the Kenneth Copelands.  I want to tell you that it is biblical to call these people out.  It's very biblical to do so.  I want to say that I appreciate what he did, but I also want to say that these men need to be exposed for who they are.  I talked to a psychologist years ago, a very interesting person, and they told me something that I've never forgotten.  They said that the psychological makeup of a TV charlatan, of a TV evangelist, of all these money-grubbing, crazy charlatans that we know, that their psychological makeup is almost identical to that of a serial killer.  And that blew me away.  I mean, how could you say such a crazy thing about these TV preachers?  Well, I got to looking.  I think from what I can tell, I think that's largely true.  A serial killer kills people as objects of his fascination.  A TV preacher spiritually kills people, feeds them poison as objects of his exaltation.  And I appreciate what was done.  I'm thankful for that.  I think that was a good gesture.  But I want to know and I want to say that these men, these Todd Whites and these Kenneth Copelands and the Benny Hens, they need to be called out for what they are.  These people are dangerous.  These people are psychopaths.  These people are spiritual serial killers.  These men are deceivers and liars and they are reprobate concerning the faith.  to the point where even a semi-Orthodox DVD handed to them enrages them so greatly that they act out like that.  That's unnerving.  Now, I showed you in this passage of Scripture, in this entire deal that we're talking about here, 2 Timothy chapter 3, and I want to show this to you because this is something that is so important for us to understand what God said about false teachers and the such.  And let's just back up here just a few verses here.  It talks about in verse number 5, it says, \"...having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof from such turn  away.\".  and it says verse 6 for of this sort are they which lead which creep into houses and lead captive silly women laden with sins led away with divers lust ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.  and so these people these people are those who they subvert whole houses.  they're subverters of people.  and the reason they subvert houses is because they have been subverted themselves.  and uh verse number eight of course is the one that we just went to a minute ago now as janice and jambreeze withstood moses.  so do these also resist the truth?  men of corrupt minds reprobate concerning the faith.  so reprobate is a good bible word that you need to know when we're dealing with these things.  also i want you to see this that the word reject is a great bible word.  That only happens just a few times, believe it or not, in the Bible.  Four times in the King James Bible.  And the last mention of the word reject is in Titus chapter 3.  It says here, this is a faithful saying.  Let's see here.  Let me move that away here.  This is a faithful saying.  And these things that thou affirm constantly, they which believe in God might be careful to maintain good works.  These things are good and profitable unto men.  Verse 9 and 10 says this.  It says, but avoid falsehood.  Foolish questions and genealogies and contentions and strivings about the law, for they are unprofitable in vain.  Notice this right here, verse 10 and 11.  A man that is an heretic, a man that's into TBN stuff, a man that won't hear the truth, after the first and second admonition, reject him.  Reject.  Knowing that he... Is such is subverted and sinneth being condemned of himself.  And so these guys, the sad thing is that these guys can so fully embrace a lie that God completely gives them over to it.  And they need to be exposed for who they are.  And they need to be called out publicly because they're killing people.  They're spiritually murdering people.  They're doing damage to homes.  They're ruining people's eternities because they're so good at articulating a lie.  And they've been so given over to that lie.  They have been deceived and are deceiving themselves.  It's pitiful.  But I want to read this to you in 2 Timothy 3.  It says, verse number 9, But they shall proceed no further, for their folly shall be made manifest unto all men, as theirs was also.  And so there's going to come a day where before the great white throne, they'll be exposed for who they are.  But in the meantime, they need to be exposed now while there's still time to help some people.  I get emails all the time from folks who have had 20 years of this nonsense.  And so you have to go back.  In order to build these people, you have to tear down 20 years of these false teachings.  And that's why these guys are so dangerous.  And so I want to say that Todd White has revealed again.  If he hasn't revealed it enough already, he revealed it again fully.  that this man is a reprobate mind concerning the faith.  He's going to hell.  And he's taking a lot of people with him.  And I think it's time we call him out.  Get away from Todd White.  This man is a demonic minister of Satan.  He is out of hell.  He is going to hell.  He is evil.  And he's destroying a lot of people.  I may not be able to help him, but I certainly can try to help you.  And as I said in the beginning here, I'm not going to waste my time trying to convert these top-tier guys because they won't listen.  You really think Kenneth Copeland is going to give all that up, all that money, airplanes, wealth, diamond rings?  You really think Kenneth Copeland is going to give that up?  You crazy.  You think Benny Hinn is going to give up all that money?  You think Paula White's going to give up all that?  I mean, the girl gets Louis Vuittons every week.  She's living high on the hog.  You really think she's going to give all that up?  I don't know.  But I do know there's a lot of other people out there, especially a lot of people in Africa.  They're trying to chase that.  And if I can expose guys like Todd White, I can rescue their souls.  Get them out of that.  And that's what we want to do with our life and ministry.  Got a lot of big things happening in Kenya.  Pray about helping us.  Pray about helping us with some projects there.  In this ministry, we go forward by faith.  We try to just do what God wants us to do and just try to reach as many Africans as we can over there in Kenya.  So we've had a great time with that.  So pray for us and pray that God would have his way and will in our life here.  But I think Todd White has... Exposed himself for how angry and... I mean, really, that little hissy fit that he threw, that was demonic.  That was evil.  And I'm glad that their folly shall be made manifest unto all men.  Subscribe to our channel.
