And in the common area, hence why we call it the commons, is a big area where students are able to just have fun, be students, mix and mingle with everyone, and study and also play video games, connect their computers to the screens and watch movies.  And it's a perfect place to live on campus because it's right in the center of everything, right next to the Vines Center, right next to DeMoss Hall, and it's super convenient for students living on campus.  So that's a little bit about our commons. ",
