His words and his actions must line up.  He must be protective.  He must strive to please you.  He has to pursue you.  He has to know what he wants.  All of those are great.  But I want to go a little bit deeper today, really quick, and talk about competent men and how to recognize these things, how to vet for those things that we may overlook.  Hello, I'm Nicole Michelle, founder and femininity influencer for the Inner Beauty Movement.  Welcome back to another video here.  And please like, share, and subscribe.  I appreciate that.  If you haven't already, jump over to YouTube, Inner Beauty TV by Nicole Michelle.  I appreciate that so much.  So let's get right into it.  So today we're talking about how to recognize a competent man for marriage.  And I'm speaking to traditional women who are down that road that they know they want to be married.  They know that want to be married.  They know they want to couple with a man who's on the right page.  They don't want to waste a lot of time with a man who may not be on the same life path as them.  They may not be ready for that right now.  So they don't want to waste a lot of time.  They also don't want to acquiesce and give all their feminine softness to a man who's going to take advantage of that and abuse her and string her along in a relationship that goes nowhere.  So we want to cut down on that.  We want women to effectively find partners they can truly build with in a relationship and build a healthy family.  Okay, so let's talk about that.  So one of the first things is associations.  Who does he hang out with?  How is his relationships with his parents and his friend circle, his associates, his neighbors, his people in his community?  What type of relationships does he have?  Does he take care of those relationships?  Does he have a good reputation?  When his name is mentioned, do people go, oh, Or do people go, oh, I know that guy.  Do people speak highly of him?  Or do they have negative things to say about him?  A lot of this has... to do with who he is as a person and it's setting you getting into a relationship and finding out he's a creepy guy.  a lot of times you can find out from people who hang around him people who are in his circle.  how do they respond to him?  how do they uh interact with him?  how does he interact with strangers?  how does he interact with children?  how does he interact with older people?  how does he interact with his family his mother his father his siblings?  How does he maintain relationships?  Is he loving?  Is he kind?  Are any of his friends married?  What's his network look like?  Who are the people that he is around most of the time?  What are their lives like?  So if he's a competent man, if he's a builder, a producer, a provider, and a protector, he's going to surround himself with like-minded men.  Another thing you want to look for is what is he doing in his spare time?  Is he watching a lot of TV?  Is he watching a lot of video games?  Or does he read books?  Is he expanding his intellect?  It's okay to have activities where he decompresses, but does he do that all the time?  Does he have enriching activities where he grows as a person like reading?  He knows what he's doing.  He's on top of things.  He's not just living and existing and when he comes home he flops on the couch and he doesn't do anything else the rest of the day.  Those are things you want to pay close attention to especially if you want a certain lifestyle, especially if you want to make sure you partner.  with someone who wants the same life as you.  You want to make sure that you're not going to be a cheerleader forever, that this person is self-motivating, he is ambitious on his own, he generally wants the best for his own life before he brings in a woman and children.  He generally wants to be better and to be the best man that he can be already.  The next one is temperament.  Now this one is real important.  Is he high headed?  Is he, you know, zero to 100?  If something doesn't go his way, does he lose his top?  If he's going off on service workers.  Is he losing his temper with children, coworkers?  These are things you want to pay attention to because these are the early signs, red flags, of someone who may not be able to control their temper and may tend to be abusive.  So you don't want to be in a relationship with someone who can't control their temper.  Does he make excuses for abusive men?  Does he make excuses for men who exploit women?  This is important because this is a cheat sheet into the future.  And he could possibly end up abusing you.  So you want to be careful of that as well, ladies.  The next one is, does he have any spiritual values?  Does he have ethics, any boundaries, any standards, any principles, any codes that he lives by?  All of these are important.  If he's a man that he hates rules, He hates codes.  There's no boundaries.  There's no standard.  There's no ethics that he lives by.  There's no spirituality.  There's nothing guiding him as a person.  That level of spirituality is missing.  And that's a red flag because there's nothing holding him.  There's no ethics.  There's no code that's telling him.  that's convicting him and telling him right from wrong and this is good and this is bad.  He just flies by the seat of his pants.  That's not a sign of a man that's good to parent and a good person to partner with because you need somebody that's bound by some type of code, some type of ethics, standards, values, something that he values, principles.  What type of principles does this man have?  And lack of any of those things or all of those things is problematic.  And it says that he's not governed by anything.  And so that may not be the person that you want to spend a lot of time with and definitely build a family with because you need a man who is able to enact Protectiveness over his family as well as discipline.  The masculine man as a husband is a disciplinarian to the children.  So if he doesn't have principles and standards and values or any of those things, it's impossible for him to implement discipline.  His house will be in disarray.  Here's another important one.  Dear heart, how does he handle failure?  Does he unravel?  Does he completely lose his mind on in and everybody because things didn't work out the way he intended?  Does he blow his top because he had a setback?  He had challenges.  Does he spiral out of control when things don't go his way?  These are important because not only is it a red flag that he has a temperament problem, but it's also a red flag that he can't handle stress and challenge.  Meaning, does he have the propensity to give up?  Is he somebody that can keep going?  Is he somebody that can take a setback and keep going?  Is he somebody that can take a hit and keep on ticking?  Is he somebody that's going to leave you hanging, leaving you there to solve the problem because he lost it, or leaving you to pick up the pieces because he's damaged relationships?  so where they can't be fixed?  Is he the type of person that's going to require pity every time things don't go his way?  Does he want you to pick up the pieces and figure it out, work it out yourself?  Are you going to have to sit there and find ways to solve the problem yourself, even though that's something he's supposed to be doing as the man?  Does he lick his wounds and get up and try again or does he just lay down and whine and complain about the world?  Does he blame women for everything?  Does he blame the government for everything?  Or does he lick his wounds and get out there and as a man make things happen?  Does he spiral into depression when things don't work his way?  This is problematic because a lot of times this type of behavior is symptomatic of something else.  And if unchecked, he may be prone to alcoholism, drug abuse, and abuse, period, to you, physical abuse.  So ladies, pay attention to that.  How does he handle setbacks?  And sometimes if they unravel because things didn't go their way, sometimes they just flat out.  Stop trying to be challenged.  They stop going out to the world to compete.  And in that situation, that leaves you on the hook.  So if you choose a guy who cannot handle adversity in life, ladies, you're going to be on the hook.  Here's another one you want to pay attention to, ladies.  Does he understand what traditional means?  Does he go into exorcist convulsions when you start talking about traditional living, traditional life, being a stay-at-home wife?  If he is not in alignment with that lifestyle and that's what you want, run for the hills.  Typically, men understand what traditional means.  So if he's having you to explain it, to backtrack, to redefine what it means, he's holding you to the fire to, why are you asking for that?  You're not in a position to ask that.  If he's doing any of that, he doesn't want that with you.  So move on.  Thank you so much for tuning in today.  I appreciate that.
