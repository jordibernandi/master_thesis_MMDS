            "text": "When we talk about buck breaking, we have to understand that buck breaking is a show of power.  It's a show of dominance.  So we can't talk about buck breaking without talking about power.  When we look at the domination of Black people by the dominant society, what we are in essence seeing is that this society wants to ensure that we are not able to actually mete out that thing that makes humans exist.  and that is creating families and procreating.  See, psychologically, when we're talking about the sexualizing of our people, primarily from the dominant society or the system of white supremacy, it had to be established in a very impinging way from the mental state.  This whole notion that masculinity is somehow toxic and detrimental to society is nothing but an attempt to emasculate black malehood.  It's clearly an agenda.  If you have two eyes in your head and you're able to see, you can see that it's an agenda, and it's an agenda to decrease our population.  It's always been about destroying the black family.  The family's the foundation of the people.  The heterosexual black meal is last on the pecking order here in America.  If you're just a heterosexual black man, how you gonna beat the case?  Because when you show up to court, when you show up to the job interview, when you show up to wherever, you coming in here as a heterosexual black man, you have no power.  When Mark Twain confessed that we white people ground the manhood out of the Negro, why ground the manhood out of the Negro?  because it's the it's black masculinity that most exposes the fraud of white masculinity.  we as the progenitors of culture the ones who are the fathers and mothers civilizations who taught all people who people look to for social cues, whether they want to realize it or not, I think they feel if they can get us to adapt to it, they can get everybody to adapt to it.  If anybody should have a problem with European males, it should be the European females.  Because everything the European male has ever learned to do to us, he first practiced on his own woman.  We need resources in education.  We need resources in labor.  We need resources in politics.  We need resources in medical.  We need resources in so many things.  But they ignore that, and they put millions and even billions of dollars to tell us that you need to really embrace your LBGT side.  So these people have an agenda.  and it's up to us to understand what the agenda is. ",
