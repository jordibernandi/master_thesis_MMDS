Several friends have reported this violation to Twitter.  Obviously, this kind of identity theft and online deception is nothing new.  And it just serves as another reminder to be wary of who we're interacting with when we're not face to face.  It's not always who we think.  For future reference, I'm not on Twitter or Facebook so you can be sure any profiles claiming to be me or to speak on my behalf are fake.  Any genuine links to other platforms will be authenticated by me through this YouTube channel.  Thanks for your vigilance.  Peace. ",
