Trump's tax cut giveaway exploded our debt, so he's threatening Social Security and Medicare.  Biden will make the wealthy and big corporations pay their fair share, so we can protect Social Security and Medicare and invest in schools and health care.  I'm Joe Biden, and I approve this message.  Thank you. ",
