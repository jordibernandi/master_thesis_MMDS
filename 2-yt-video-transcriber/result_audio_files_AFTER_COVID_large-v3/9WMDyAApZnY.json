They don't like it when citizens somewhat or know their rights.  They hate it with a passion as much as they hate cameras.  Now everybody that has a phone these days in this day and age has a camera and cops hate it.  Cops hate it because they can't do what they used to do, which is violate people's rights and get away with it.  Or in some cases they still get away with it, but at least It's out there for the public to judge, right?  Roll the clip. ",

She's trying to get a hold of the guy that called us.  For what were we doing?  I don't entirely know.  But she came to knock on the window, so what were you coming for?  What was she coming for?  She came to make contact with you two.  For what?  For sitting in the white SUV.  In a parking lot.  that's got to do with a restaurant that's open.  24 hours.  So what did we do wrong?  You're free to leave.  I know I'm free to leave.  We're not detaining you.  You can't detain me.  I didn't do nothing wrong.  So first of all, let's talk about that.  But the second part is, what did we do wrong?  Nothing.  It don't matter what we got.  What do you got to come knock on our window, bothering us?  Okay.  So I couldn't knock on a car window in a parking lot?  For what?  You didn't knock on nobody else's.  There was a car right next to ours running that you didn't knock on.  Right.  So then what's the problem here?  There is no problem right now.  Now there's a problem.  What's your name?  I just told you not to call into suspicious emails in the parking lot.  Does that work?  I don't know.  I'm not looking at the camera.  I'm just, I'm asking you.  T-A-M-A-N?  Yep, T-A-M-A-N.  What's your name?  Miss Hunter?  Do you have numbers?  It don't matter what we're doing.  I lost taste for food.  Probably haven't seen my food or something, so I don't want it.  I got other plans for you though.  I'm going to talk to Lou Fredericks about you though.  I'm going to talk to his senator about you.  That's what I'm going to do.  Lou Fredericks.  Okay.  Yeah, I'm going to talk to him about you.  What are you going to say?  I'm going to make sure I show him this because we wasn't doing nothing wrong.  And there's a million people coming in and out of this parking lot the entire time.  And you're talking about.  you got a call about us and we're not doing nothing wrong.  How would you get a call?  and there's a car right next to us?  She didn't knock on the car right next to us.  that went right over.  She went right past him, but she got a suspicious call on us.  Why is it suspicious?  Let me make that up.  Why did I make that up?  Why would I just come and pick your car out?  What's suspicious about it, though, is what I'm saying.  Were you guys at the night deposit tonight?  No.  Why would it matter?  Why would it matter?  Who called for us?  There's a female here that said two subjects who saw the night deposit and thought that they followed her here.  We came with a car full of girls.  Okay.  I don't know the circumstances, which is why we investigate the calls we get.  We don't make them up.  Okay.  So why are you, why are you didn't say anything about that at the window?  You said nothing.  I said, I'm gonna go find out why you guys were suspicious.  But you just said that we followed somebody here.  Right, that's the report we got.  Come on, man.  You guys look stupid, man.  Like I said, I'm going to show you.  You look stupid.  is what I said.  I didn't say you're stupid.  You might be stupid.  I don't know that.  But you look stupid.  You guys look stupid.  You look like dumb and dumb.  I'm just letting you know.  I'm just letting you know.  It's better than your bullshit.  Clown.  He's a clown, man. ",
