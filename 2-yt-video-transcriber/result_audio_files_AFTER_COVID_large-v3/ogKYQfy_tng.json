And what you're going to talk about has to do with a specific, very, very famous rabbi who just died.  The media is reporting it.  It was in relation to COVID-19 complications.  And you're going to explain that.  You're going to explain how the funeral went from something that could have been huge down to this tiny little number of people that showed up.  But you're going to explain to us the supernatural that's behind all of this because you had a chance to witness to this rabbi some time back.  And you're going to share with us something that was shared at the funeral that just kind of just... brought it alive in your spirit, what this rabbi was doing, perhaps.  And I can't wait for the folks to hear it.  So I'm going to hush and let you tell the story of this famous rabbi that just passed and the supernatural that's connected to it.  Go ahead, Zef. ",

            "text": "Rabbi Eliyahu Ador and Bakshi was the former chief rabbi of Israel, together with Rabbi Lau.  Those of you who are I've read my testimony in messiahofisraelministries.org.  You know that I was connected with Rabbi Lau very much, and therefore, through Rabbi Lau, I was able to minister to Rabbi Doran Bakshi.  He passed away a few days ago from the COVID-19.  He arrived at the hospital, and within four or five days, the rabbi passed away.  When he passed away... he left instruction in his funeral to read Psalms 18, verse 2.  But I want to back up a little bit, because in 2017, this particular rabbi went through a very, very difficult time in Israel.  He was convicted of some kind of a crime where they tried to convict him, they tried to indict him.  He was going through a very difficult time in 2017, and this is when I had the opportunity, through my relationship with Rabbi Israel Lau, to minister to Rabbi Doran Bakshi and had several meetings with him one-on-one, but later on, many meetings on the internet, because of his position, it's very, very difficult for him to meet, very jeopardizing his reputation.  We did a lot of meetings on GoToMeeting and other links that he sent me, preaching the Gospel to him.  Rabbi Doran Bakshi never denied Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus.  On the contrary, he was very touched that in 2017, I reached out to him when everybody else was against him, and I shared the love of Jesus with him, and I think it really touched him.  The Holy Spirit really touched him.  So we go to his funeral.  Number one, he was a big rabbi known here in Israel, kind of like Rabbi Yitzhak Adouri, maybe a little bit smaller.  At least 200,000 or 300,000 people would have attended his funeral, but because of the COVID-19 and the restrictions of the Israeli government and the Israeli health department, It limited to 20 or 25 people of some main rabbis in that funeral.  However, the funeral was televised to all Israel, so over 8 million people watched the funeral.  That's way more that would have been there if the cameras would not have been in that funeral.  And in the funeral, the rabbi reads instructions that he left.  Watch the instructions.  I don't want you to read from the rabbinic traditional book.  I want you to read Psalms.  And he quotes Psalms 18, verse 2.  The Lord is my rock and my fortune, my deliverer.  And he's quoted Psalms 18, excuse me, verses 18, verse 16.  That's what he quoted.  He reached down from on high and took hold of me.  He drew me out of deep waters.  Now that, first of all, it's huge that a rabbi would quote the Psalms, but he was saying something, because if we look at the context, of Psalms 18.  We'll go back to Psalms 18, verse 2.  It reads like this.  The Lord is my rock, my fortune, my deliverer.  My God is my rock in whom I take refuge, my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold.  What's the word for salvation in Hebrew?  It's Jesus, Yeshua.  So he was preaching the Gospel.  He chose Psalms 18, verse 16, in order for people to go and read the whole context of what is this speaking about.  It's speaking about Yeshua.  So the rabbi was actually preaching the Gospel.  We don't know if he believed in Yeshua.  He didn't quote, but everything, my relationship with him, the fact that he did what he did, the Bible verse that he quoted here indicates that this rabbi, like Rabbi Yitzhak Aduri, believed that Yeshua is the Messiah, Several months ago, four or five months ago, before he passed away, well, he didn't know he was going to pass away, but before he passed away, I had the opportunity to give him the book that you and I wrote, The Rabbi, The Secret Message, and The Identity of the Messiah.  We don't know these four months, but him reading the book and understanding the revelation of Rabbi Yitzhak Aduri, how much that triggered him to the Word of God as well.  We give Jesus all the glory.  For your listeners that are listening to this and saying, okay, so a rabbi reads the Psalms.  What's the big deal?  It is a huge deal that a rabbi in his position would jeopardize his own reputation by telling them, guys, don't read from the rabbinic book.  I want you to read from the Psalms.  And which Psalms?  The Psalms that point to Yeshua HaMashiach. ",

That's the story of Rabbi Yesa Kaduri, who basically did something very similar that this rabbi did, except that Rabbi Kaduri died.  left a note in his own handwriting saying that Jesus is Messiah.  And this rabbi that you were just speaking of that just passed away the other day left instructions, and you said it's unusual for a rabbi to have the Psalms quoted.  Rather, usually at the funerals, they have prayer books quoted.  Speak about that just a little bit. ",

We need to understand, first of all, that there are rabbis there that don't believe in Yeshua, so I'm sure they did that.  But they had to abide in what he said.  It was kind of like a decree of a king.  Think about that.  The king decreed.  He was like a king, right?  He decreed, you must read this psalm in my funeral.  So they had to do it.  And without even realizing it, they were preaching the gospel to millions on television.  When a rabbi... Rabbis read books from... They read interpretations of books.  They read other rabbinic books.  They read the Talmud.  They read the Zohar.  They read the prayer book.  They don't necessarily read direct from the Psalms, especially in a funeral or in a marriage.  They don't do that.  This is huge.  And the fact that he did it is going to open many doors here in Israel, because people are going to begin to ask, Why did he do it?  And even if they don't ask, we're going to ask them why he did it.
