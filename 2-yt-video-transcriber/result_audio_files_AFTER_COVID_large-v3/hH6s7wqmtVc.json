            "text": "Shalom, I'm Messianic Rabbi Zev Porat, and welcome to a special outreach update from Jerusalem, Israel.  We are living in exciting and prophetic times.  There has never been a generation closer to the second coming of Jesus Yeshua than this generation.  We're not setting any dates, but we know that the time is near.  We know that the veil is being lifted.  2 Corinthians 3, verse 16, and Jews are being saved like never before.  There is a revival in Israel.  In Israel, like around the world, the COVID-19 is shaking those that don't believe in Yeshua.  And unfortunately, even some that do believe in Yeshua.  And he's using it to scare Jews in Israel because he knows that his time is near.  Revelation chapter 12, verse 12.  Therefore rejoice, you heavens, and you who dwell in them, but woe to the earth and the sea, because the devil has gone down to you.  He is filled with fury because he knows that his time is short.  The devil and his demons are doing all they can to put panic into people, are doing all they can to try to stop the gospel.  But we rejoice because the devil's running out of ammunition.  The best he's got is COVID-19.  But those under the blood of the Lamb, the remnant, as believers in Yeshua, in Jesus, we understand this is spiritual warfare.  We understand that the devil's at rage.  Greater is he in us than the one in the world.  We overcome by the testimony of the blood of Yeshua, Jesus.  We overcome by the blood of the Lamb.  We're using the panic of the COVID-19, the demonic outpouring, to preach the gospel.  As believers in Yeshua and Jesus, we understand that Satan's power is limited.  If Satan has launched this COVID-19 and God allowed it as a wake-up call, it means that now, more than ever, it's time for the gospel to go forth.  Orthodox rabbis in Israel that don't believe in Yeshua are shaking from the COVID-19.  Jews in Israel are shaking from the COVID-19.  And as a result, many are flocking to the Kotel area, the western wall, to pray.  But because of the panic of the COVID-19, even the Kotel area has restrictions.  They put white boxes like fences all around the Kotel area in order to get people to distance themselves.  And they're not allowing huge crowds to go in.  at one time.  As the ministry team were praying, I began to preach the gospel to the Jews that were there praying and panicking.  You could hear the panic all over.  As Orthodox Jews, secular Jews, we're all talking about the COVID-19.  We're all saying, we came here to get a blessing.  We don't want our family to get the COVID-19.  Satan is working overtime.  What the enemy meant for evil, God is going to turn around for good.  Genesis chapter 50 verse 20.  You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good, to accomplish what is now being done, the saving of many lives.  As the ministry team were praying, I began to preach the gospel.  I was sharing with many, but I noticed that there was a line.  I looked inside the Kotel area and I noticed that there was a rabbi there, a very known rabbi, Harav Yaakov Metzger, Rabbi Jacob Metzger.  He was praying and crying at the Kotel area and others were waiting to get a blessing from him.  I immediately entered the area and was stopped by two Jews.  who said, are you waiting to get a blessing from this rabbi?  I said, no, I'm coming here to give the rabbi a blessing.  They were shocked by my statement and let me in.  Praise Yeshua.  Rabbi Metzger turned to me and asked, what is your name?  I told him my name is Zev.  He said, are you here to receive a blessing that you would not be hit by the COVID-19?  I told the rabbi Metzger, I'm here to tell you about a blessing.  The rabbi was puzzled.  He said, what do you mean?  Are you a scientist?  Do you have a cure for the COVID-19?  I told Rabbi Metzger, I'm not a scientist and I'm not a doctor.  And there is a cure, not just for the COVID-19, but for all sickness and disease.  He asked, what do you mean?  I turned the Bible to 2 Chronicles 7, verse 14, and read together with Rabbi Metzger.  If my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face... and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and I will forgive their sin and heal their land.  This is the key for all sickness, for all disease, for all sin.  Rabbi Metzger turned to me and said, But I'm a rabbi.  That's exactly what I'm doing here.  I asked the rabbi, We just read in the Bible, if my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and seek my face.  Who is that name?  Rabbi Metzger said, God.  I said, read the Bible verse again.  We read the Bible verse again.  If my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and seek my face.  Seek my face.  What is his name?  I turned to the rabbi and said, This is speaking about the Messiah.  All those who call on his name shall be healed in this world and for eternity.  Rabbi Metzger said, No one knows who that Messiah is.  We're all waiting for him.  But until that time, we come here to the Kotel and pray.  And because I'm a rabbi, I bring the prayers of the people to the wall here.  I asked the rabbi with love and compassion, what does the Bible say that the prayers to God go through a wall?  The rabbi was speechless.  He didn't have an answer.  I turned the Bible to the book of Isaiah, chapter 35, verse 8.  And a highway will be there.  it will be called the way of holiness in hebrew.  it will be for those who walk on that way.  the unclean will not journey on it.  wicked fools will not go about on it.  the only way to make it to the father is through one way the way of the holiness the messiah not through a wall.  The rabbi then turned to me and said, rabbis don't believe in that way.  I asked Rabbi Metzger, have you ever heard of Rabbi Yitzhak Kaduri?  Rabbi Yitzhak Kaduri.  Metzger turned to me and said, not only have I heard of Rabbi Yitzhak Kaduri, but my father was his good friend.  And in fact, Rabbi Kaduri bar mitzvahed me.  I told Rabbi Metzger, Rabbi Kaduri knew the way of holiness.  He knew how to make it to the Father.  He knew who is the one who forgives all iniquities and heals all diseases.  At that moment, something supernatural happened.  Rabbi Metzger's attention was now all ears.  It was time to pull out the book, the rabbi, the secret message, and the identity of the Messiah.  There is no revival without the Word of God.  But Jews need to be taken to the Word of God, and they take at face value what rabbis have to say.  When Rabbi Metzger saw Rabbi Kaduri's name, his face was glowing.  He asked me, is this a book that Rabbi Kaduri wrote?  I said the book is written about Rabbi Kaduri, but inside the book, there is a revelation revealing the name of Mashiach, Messiah, the one who can heal, the one who can take you on the highway and the way of holiness.  No one makes it to the Father, but only through the way of holiness, only through the Messiah.  It doesn't say in the Bible through a wall.  It says, through the way of holiness, and that is Mashiach, Messiah.  We looked at many pages in the book, the rabbi, the secret message, and the identity of the Messiah, and finally reached page 53, and decoded the note in Hebrew, according to the instructions that Rabbi Yitzhak Kaduri left.  When we decoded the note, and he read the note that Rabbi Yitzhak Kaduri left, that Yeshua, Jesus, is the Messiah, he almost fainted.  He could not persecute.  He could not be angry.  He started to mumble.  This is impossible.  How can it be?  I said, they put it on his website, and they took it down.  You can check it.  You can confirm it.  He said with a very low voice, I'm asking you right now to leave.  Don't cause trouble.  It was time for the full gospel.  The only way that we can be healed from COVID-19 or from any kind of disease is through Messiah Yeshua.  We must repent and believe that he died on the tree on the cross for our sins.  He rose on the third day and by his blood, we have full redemption of sins, eternal life.  Rabbi Kaduri understood this.  He received a vision.  He received revelation that Yeshua, Jesus, is the Messiah.  In fact, we now have 14 students confessing that Yeshua, Jesus, is the Messiah and more are coming to faith.  The truth is going forth.  The rabbi began to mumble in Yiddish and other languages.  He started to curse and say, you're a missionary, you're a missionary.  We never argue.  with a demonic spirit.  We just preached the gospel.  I turned the Bible back to Isaiah 35 verse 8 and read out loud in Hebrew.  And a highway will be there.  It will be called the way of holiness.  It will be for those who walk on that way.  The unclean will not journey on it.  Wicked fools will not go about on it.  I asked the rabbi, do you want the way of holiness?  Do you want your family to be saved?  Today it's the COVID-19, tomorrow it's the COVID-22.  Satan and his demons will do everything they can to cause panic.  And God says, and a highway will be there.  It will be called the way of holiness.  And that holiness is Mashiach Yeshua.  No one makes it to the Father, but only through Him.  This wall cannot do anything.  It was supernatural.  The rabbi told the people to leave the area as he could not pray.  The power of the Holy Spirit was hovering all over the Kotel area.  Praise Yeshua.  Rabbi Metzgil turned to me and said, I asked you please to leave.  It's supernatural.  To preach the gospel in the Kotel area could be a stoning offense.  But yet this rabbi was begging me to leave.  The power of the whole Hakodesh, the Holy Spirit was there.  I told the rabbi, I will not leave.  I turned the Bible to Psalm 71 verse 15 and proclaimed it.  My mouth will declare your righteousness and your salvation all day long, though I cannot know their full measure.  And the word for salvation is, In Hebrew is Yeshua.  So I was reading like this over and over again.  My mouth will declare your righteousness and your Yeshua all day long, though I cannot know their full measure.  I gave Rabbi Metzger contact information and told him to call.  Don't be afraid.  Let's study the word of God together.  And the devil, Satan, will not have a grip on you.  And you'll have eternal life.  The rabbi turned to me and said, but I'm Jewish, I'm Jewish.  I said, there's no more Jewish message than this.  Rabbi Kaduri believed it.  King David believed it.  Yeshua was an Israelite, a Jew.  Moses was a Jew.  And even Moses testifies in Deuteronomy chapter 18 that there'll come a prophet.  You must listen to him.  This is Yeshua, Jesus.  You were born a Jew, and you will die a Jew.  But a real Jew, a completed Jew, an eternal Jew, is a Jew that believes in Yeshua, Jesus.  We pray for Rabbi Metzgil's salvation and all those that heard the gospel.  And for Zion's sake, we will not keep silent.  Isaiah 62 verse 1.  For Zion's sake, I will not keep silent.  For Jerusalem's sake, I will not remain quiet.  Till her vindication shines out like the dawn, her salvation like a blazing torch.  And we know that the translation in Hebrew for salvation is Yeshua, Jesus Christ.  So it reads like this, And heard Yeshua like a blazing torch.  And he's coming back with fire in his eyes as the Lion of the tribe of Judah.  Revelation 5.5, To take back everything that the enemy has stolen.  And until that time, we will continue to proclaim his name.  We will continue to preach the gospel.  Until all Israel shall be saved.  Romans 11.26, Let's continue to stand together as the one new man, Ephesians 2.15, bring the gospel back to Jerusalem and go home.  Until next time, I'm Messianic Rabbi Zev Porat, sending you blessings from Jerusalem, Israel, in the mighty name of the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, Ah Yehudah, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, Jesus Yeshua, Amen.
