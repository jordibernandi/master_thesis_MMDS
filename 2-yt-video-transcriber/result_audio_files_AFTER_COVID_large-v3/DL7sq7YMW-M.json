To him was given dominion and authority.  His victory was won.  Let's give it up for the Lord Jesus!  What's happening, what's happening?  What's happening, what's happening?  smoke machines, a dance troupe, gaudy thrones, a stage crew to make the final adjustments, and now the big gun.  Senior Pastor Myles McPherson starts off by allowing the applause to continue, to give it up for Jesus, and begins by asking the people what's happening.  Well, what should be happening is the pastor ready to open God's Word and preach from it.  Now remember, we're looking at the altar call, so let's cut to the end of his sermon. ",

He sees you, a little guy in the back.  Now, where did this activity originate?  Well, it doesn't go back quite as far as one might think.  Most historians would agree that the father of the modern-day altar call is Charles Finney, a 19th century Presbyterian pastor who turned out to be a full-blown heretic.

            "text": "Now, I'm not about to give Charles Finney such high marks, and here is why.  In his systematic theology, written by a man who never even went to seminary, by the way, is full of doctrinal error.  He believed in Christian perfectionism and is quoted as saying this in regards to a Christian who commits a sin.  This is wild.  Whenever he sins, he said, he must for the time being cease to be holy.  This is self-evident.  No passages he gives, it just is.  Whenever he sins, he must be condemned.  He must incur the penalty of the law of God.  In other words, if you sin by lusting after someone as you walk down the street and get hit by a bus at that very moment before you have time to repent, you will be eternally lost.  Finney denied the doctrine of original sin, that we are held responsible for Adam's disobedience.  He taught that sin does not come from Adam's sinful nature, which is clearly taught in Romans chapter 5, but rather that sin is an act that we can, by our own moral free will, engage in or avoid.  Now that's straight out Pelagianism, a 4th century heresy that was condemned at the Council of Ephesus in 431.  Finney denied the death of Jesus as a substitutionary atonement for the sins of his people, and rather taught that it was an example of the virtue of Jesus that Christians are to follow.  He believed that being born again is simply an act of the human will, rather than a supernatural act of God.  the Holy Spirit performs on the human heart.  He denied the doctrine of justification and the imputation of Christ's righteousness to the believing sinner by faith alone and said that it is, I quote, founded on a most false and nonsensical assumption.  In short, Finney believed and taught another gospel.  Think of Galatians.  And it is in no way Christian at all. ",

And therein lies the problem with the anxious bench, as he called it, or as we call it today, the altar call.  Finney said this about revivals.  A revival is purely a philosophical or scientific result of the right use of constitutional means.  In other words, if the emotions are stirred to a certain level, then a certain reaction can be expected.  But here are some real dangers associated with the altar call.  It shifts the real issue of an awareness of sin by the weight of God's law and the need of a Savior to getting a person so emotionally charged up that he or she performs an action like raising a hand or walking down an aisle.  This cannot help but create a false sense of being converted to Christianity by virtue of something the person did, rather than a true repentance of sin and a real trusting in Christ that is brought about by the mercy of God.  It's a sad fact that many who go no farther than performing this act of walking down an aisle may spend the rest of their lives thinking they are saved from God's wrath when in fact they are still under it and headed for eternal destruction.  So what's a God-honoring way of ending a sermon that calls the unbeliever to trust in Christ?  Now, I make no apologies for using a sermon clip from the pastor of the church I attend because it is such a good example of how to do this right. ",

A great Reformed catechism asks this question.  Since faith alone makes a share in Christ and all his benefits, where does this faith come from?  The answer it gives is this, from the Holy Spirit.  Now think of John 3 verse 5.  No one can enter the kingdom of God unless they are born of water and the Spirit.  Now think of 1 Corinthians 10.16.  Is not the cup of blessing which we bless a sharing or participation in the blood of Christ?  Is not the bread we break a sharing or participation in the body of Christ?  The gospel of Jesus the Christ, heard with the ears when preached, and felt and tasted with the sacraments, is not simply the beginning of the Christian life.  It is the essence of the Christian life.  Without it, our justification, our sanctification, and our ultimate glorification cannot and will not happen.  As the Apostle Paul says in 1 Corinthians 15, For I delivered to you of first importance.  what I also received, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that he was buried, and that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures.  And he goes on to say this as well.  If Christ has not been raised, your faith is worthless.  You're still in your sins.  Then those who have died in Christ... have perished.  If we have hoped in Christ in this life only, we are of all people most to be pitied.  But now Christ has been raised from the dead, the first fruits of those who are asleep, or who have died in Christ.  For since by a man came death, by a man also came the resurrection of the dead.  Who are these men?  For in Adam all die, so also in Christ will all be made alive.  As Christians, let us continue to look to Christ Jesus and nowhere else And know that we're cleansed and forgiven of all our sins.  And know that we are no longer under the curse of sin and death, but are now and forever, as Pastor Svensson said, sheltered within God's covenantal embrace. ",
