            "text": "I don't think I'm going to get through my royal family.  Bare with it, sister.  I'm going to try my best.  So, you know, from time to time, I like to invoke humor in my royal family.  And there's a lot of people up because they're wondering who will be the president.  We all know they're one and the same.  But Trump is quite unique.  He, you know, lets his presence be felt and known.  Basically, Trump is a man-child.  Or... a straight up toddler.  You know, he demonstrate those particular traits, you know, with his ill behavior and his shenanigans.  And, you know, I have discovered the reason why Trump is screaming and hollering as he, you know, do.  He don't like his diaper changed.  And he bitches about that, you know, and when they force his ass to get on the potty chair, then he got to be extra and, you know, fuck with the walls and stuff.  You know, you don't see no letters there, no particular art or anything because he has zero IQ.  Seriously, my royal family in the world, the world leaders, um, know what they're looking at and what they're dealing with.  That's why he's the butt of all jokes worldwide.  And he feels these things.  When he's joked on and, you know, feeling totally dejected, you know, they try their best to calm his ass down so they can get whatever they need to get out of him.  So, yeah, you got to bottle feed him, breast feed him, or whatever, whatever.  you know, you have to do to get whatever you got to get.  Because, see, Trump, you know, he wants you to hold his hand all damn day, walk him all... All right.  I got... See, Mr.  Santana messed up my train of thought, but I'm still about to deliver.  So this, these pictures that I'm showing you basically is Trump's true self, you know, and he feels entitled.  And again, when he don't get his way.  This is what you have to deal with.  Plus that shitty diaper that he wear all damn day.  Now y'all know long ago, a few years ago, I made a video about them shitty diapers.  Y'all know he was leaking.  All his ass was leaking.  Butt pee pee.  Brown butt pee pee.  Let me just get to the point because I'm just going to make this video short and sweet.  But, um, Now, what I'm about to present my royal family, and I'll play it about two times or so, as Trump's truest essence in how he gets down when you simply say no.  Lean up in this, my royal family.  Let's see what's really going on.  No!  No!  I couldn't even stop.  Don't drop.  One more time.  One more time.  I'm going to get my ass off of here.  well my royal family oh this shit is fine.  let me take this off oh my goodness.  well anyway Trump The cat is out the bag.  Your wife had to change your shitty diapers.  I know you.  somewhere in the White House, maybe you up in that damn bunker, licking on the walls and worrying if you're going to become the president or not.  We, you know, overall in the royal family, we simply don't care who becomes the president because ain't nothing going to change.  Just like you.  I mean, you're a straight up whiny ass toddler and you want constant attention.  you may get what you've been praying for trump.  do you pray trump i wonder?  you know he wants to be seen as the king.  how the hell you gonna be a king with a leaky ass?  how you do that?  you want everybody to wait on you at your beck and call, you got us real fucked up.  You know?  You know, deal with them super spreaders, your inner circle.  They'll help you out.  Get off of here.  All right, my royal family.  Render your voice with your beautiful divine words.  And as always, my royal family, I thank you for your love.  I thank you for your support.  And with that said, I'll shake.  That's funny. ",
