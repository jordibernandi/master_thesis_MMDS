            "text": "Oh, photographs for news, advertising, or commercial purposes, 41 CFR 102-74-420.  Except where security regulations, back there, dickhead, orders or directives apply, or a federal court order or rule prohibits, which is back there, right?  Persons entering upon the facility may take photographs of you piece of shit.  Space occupied by a tenant agency for non-commercial purposes, which is right here, you piece of shit.  Space occupied by a tenant agency, which is right here.  Again, want to fill it in for me?  You piece of shit.  And building entrances, lobbies, foyers, corridors, auditoriums for news purposes.  Again, you piece of shit.  He was ready to touch me too.  Oh man, you messed with the wrong guy today.  He did it with me.  So my concern is he knows what we're doing here and he still acted in that fashion.  So right now he's under citizen's arrest.  Okay.  So you have the right to remain silent.  Anything you say can be abused against you in a court of law.  You have the right to an attorney.  If you cannot afford one, one will be presented to you at the court by no cost.  You're now under citizen's arrest.  So can I have your, what is your position here?  What's going on, guys?  Josh with Accountability for All at the Federal Building, United States Post Office, United States Courthouse in Burlington, Vermont.  Let's see if they respect our rights to film in a public place.  Let's find out.  Oh, what is this?  Is this the post office?  I can't film in here.  Over that way.  Oh, it's over here?  Okay.  So where, is it no filming?  You can't film in the building.  Sir, I'm reading the Bill of Rights.  Yeah, the Bill of Rights is not to film.  The Bill of Rights actually gives me the authority to film.  Don't, don't.  So we're trying to, are you the supervisor, sir?  Come on.  So is the no filming allowed inside, like whatever this area is?  This way, guys.  Is there a sign that posts that somewhere?  You're not that ignorant.  It's right there.  Your buddy's got it.  Yeah, look at it.  of the press and of the right of the people.  It says it right there, so I don't know why you're preventing me from... So it does say, attention visitors, no electronic devices inside the lobby.  But we're not inside the lobby.  Right.  We're inside the lobby.  All right, well, we'll check out the door.  Yeah.  So... There you go.  Wow, huh?  What's his name, sir?  Can I have your name as well, please?  Yes, I'm C.S.O.  Currier.  C.S.O.  Currier, thank you.  And this gentleman's name?  That would be great, because now I want to press criminal charges for assault.  Yeah, assault is not the battery, that's the gesture.  He was threatening in his mannerisms.  I'm waiting for your supervisor.  Can I have your name, please?  No, so you're refusing to identify.  You're employed by the court.  Okay, well, why don't you tell me?  I mean, court security officer, United States Marshal Service.  Are you U.S.  Marshals?  No, I'm not a U.S.  Marshal.  So, I mean, that's kind of vague, but that's fine.  So now we're just going to wait to speak to the supervisor.  Because you tried to intimidate the wrong guy, buddy.  That's what you did.  That's the mistake that you made today.  I was going to say we came in the wrong entrance, but it looks like we came in the right entrance.  This guy's identified himself.  My problem is not with him.  It's with this aggressive, dangerous... No.  It's with this guy.  So now we're going to find... Now we're going to get... Maybe we should just call the police ourselves.  I didn't let you into my secret.  I have a civil rights activism channel.  I travel all across the country.  I have millions of views.  I'm aware of that.  You are.  So you're acting like a piece of shit and you know that.  Nice.  Yeah, it's my freedom of speech to do so.  You swore to uphold that constitutional oath, didn't you?  Or did you not?  Are you just uneducated?  Or are you ignorant?  A whole lot of questions, zero answers.  Good for you.  Can you spell famous?  Because you just became famous.  So now we'll wait for your supervisor to arrive.  And here's the other mistake you made.  You didn't think that maybe we stumbled in here in the wrong way or maybe we came in here on purpose.  And I looked up your policies and I can't bring any recording devices without special permission or a press access pass?  Beyond this point.  Right here, I'm fine.  You scumbag.  Smile for the thumbnail.  You're famous.  Bully.  Bully.  It's guys like you, it's just, how about this?  Guys like him that make good guys like him look bad.  Yeah, well, he's doing all right.  I would do a for charity, I would do a for charity legal boxing match with you.  Maybe you'd take me up on that.  And you probably wouldn't want to look, you probably wouldn't want to be publicly shamed, so.  Is a supervisor on the way, sir?  Thank you so much.  All right, guys, so just to be clear, our issue is not with CFO Currier right now.  It's with this piece of shit.  Oh, you're going to learn a very valuable lesson today in the Constitution.  Very, very valuable.  You know what?  Look at this.  We the people, brother.  Not you the fucking tyrant.  I knew you'd do it too.  I knew you would do it.  That's why I checked the policies before I walked in here.  The Bill of Rights is on the frigging wall.  Oh, now he's just realizing that maybe he screwed up bad.  So we're gonna speak to a supervisor.  Oh, photographs for news, advertising, or commercial purposes, 41 CFR 102-74-420.  Except where security regulations, back there, dickhead.  Orders or directives apply, or a federal court order or rule prohibits, which is back there.  Right?  Persons entering upon the facility may take photographs of you.  piece of shit.  Space occupied by a tenant agency for non-commercial purposes, which is right here, you piece of shit.  Space occupied by a tenant agency, which is right here, again, wanna fill it in for me?  You piece of shit.  And building entrances, lobbies, foyers, corridors, auditoriums for news purposes, again?  You piece of shit.  Oh man, you messed with the wrong guy today.  Wrong guy today.  Can you say viral video?  My video from two days ago has 100,000 views and that's slow.  Oh, you are such a dumb piece of shit.  Wow.  So guys, listen.  So he tries to put his hands on him.  I'm going live for this.  Maybe I should go live.  You want to see how fast I can get a thousand people watching?  Real fast.  I'm going to take the lead on this.  Not great.  So I checked your policy.  I'm sorry.  I'm all tightened up because he was just physically threatening.  Okay.  So nice to meet you.  I don't want to divulge my name at this point because I'm feeling threatened.  I came in this door.  No one's threatening you?  Oh, he actually did.  I call him Officer Shitbag.  Okay.  So to just skip forward, okay, we walked in this door, and the first thing they both, now, he's been okay.  He tells us that there's no filming in here.  I checked before I came.  I know the federal regulations.  I can't go back there and film.  This is public law.  It's part of your CFR.  So I want to know why.  he came around, physically threatened him, got up in his face.  That's considered assault.  Did he touch you?  I think he put his hands on me, and that's on video.  Okay, so now I'm going to have to press charges against him.  All right.  He happened to do it with a really big channel.  All right.  So now a big channel.  I do civil rights activisms and I do.  What's the channel?  So I have a huge YouTube channel. ",
