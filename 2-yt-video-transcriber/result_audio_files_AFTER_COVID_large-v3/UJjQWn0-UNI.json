If anything, what happens is the people who have the pensions inside those companies, the employees of these companies, end up owning more of the company.  The people that get wiped out are the speculators that own the unsecured tranches of debt or the folks that own the equity.  And by the way, those are the rules of the game.  That's right, because these are the people that purport to be the most sophisticated investors in the world.  They deserve to get wiped out.  But the employees don't get wiped out.  The pensions don't typically get wiped out. ",

            "text": "So that was awesome.  Now, this is a message that is heard a lot.  People are often saying this on the left.  But when you hear this sort of message coming from a venture capitalist, a former Facebook executive, a billionaire, and he is deriding wealthy CEOs and saying how the people should be bailed out at the expense of these companies... It holds a little more weight for at least the audience that needs to hear it, the audience that watches CNBC, largely wealthy executives.  Now, there are a couple of issues here.  Where he's off a little bit.  So let me just show you, like, I appreciate the entire message in this video, but he is off a little bit.  Before I get there, though, I do want to say, so he had a response to this person here on Twitter, asking him, call your interview on Halftime Report.  Had a question.  If we let airlines go bankrupt and they kept employees on, where would the employee salaries come from with no revenue coming in due to the virus?  No business should take on debt after coming out of bankruptcy.  And then he responds saying UBI, so universal basic income.  We should spend $8 trillion and give every American their 2019 taxes back.  So that is how he would propose actually helping people, getting money to people is through UBI.  And I agree that people should have a UBI right now.  But there is an issue with... His approach in that clip.  So Matt Brunig tweets out here, this guy is great, hilarious, and right, though it is better to wipe them out, wipe out the rich CEOs, through equity dilution, bailouts for equity, than through bankruptcy restructuring.  So the issue with relying on bankruptcy is when companies are going bankrupt, they are often laying off employees in the process of when they are about to go bankrupt.  So employees will lose their job in that process.  Even though it may not be through bankruptcy, it would be in the lead up to bankruptcy, employees losing their jobs.  When you have bailouts for equity, what you are doing is you are returning the company to the employees or to the government if there's an equity stake in terms of the government having equity in these companies.  So that would save the employees.  While still, yes, wiping out the wealthy CEOs.  So just the approach of just looking at bankruptcy as the solution, I don't think is really, really gives you the full picture.  Another aspect of what he said there was with pensions.  So he sort of just assumed that people with pensions in these companies would keep their pensions.  That isn't always the case.  So to give you a couple examples here, GE here, this is from late last year, August 23, 2019.  GE freezes worker pensions, what to do if your employer changes the terms of your retirement plan.  So they go into more details here.  But essentially, they were freezing worker pensions for current employees.  So people that already had their pensions, retirees already still had their pensions.  But also, that isn't even always the case.  Looking at Sears here.  So this is from CBC.  This again was a couple years ago, August 2018.  It's going to be hard.  Sears pension payments cut by 30% this week.  And this includes people.  This was while Sears was going out of business.  So pensions being cut in the process of bankruptcy.  So it isn't always the case that these employees get to keep their pensions.  In fact, in most cases, or in many cases, I would say it isn't the case.  But with all that being said, the overall spirit of this appearance on CNBC, I think, was fantastic.  And really, let me just play the first eight seconds again.  It's maybe my favorite part of the entire thing. ",
