And I just want to say, above all else, have a very Merry Christmas.  Enjoy your families, your friends.  Make this a time of love and renewing that love.  And let's get ready and help each other through what's coming.  And pray to Our Father, our Heavenly Father, our Eternal Father, Avinu Ha-Melech Ha-Olam, through His Son, Jesus Christ, Yeshua Ha-Mashiach, who made this sacrifice for us.  And even though this is a pagan holiday period, it never hurts to recognize Jesus anyway.  and to thank God for all of our blessings.  So let me show you the decorations here.  Again, have a merry, merry Christmas.  Okay everybody, take care.  Merry Christmas to everyone. ",
