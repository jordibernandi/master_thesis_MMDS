I'm in my scrubs now because I was on my way to work this morning to go to a special customer service required class that we all have to take every year.  And I got there and the class was canceled.  And I asked why?  Because I was at work till past midnight yesterday.  working in OR.  And I was told that it was canceled because they're expecting a sharp uptick in the Rona in COVID cases.  So the hospital must prepare for it.  It is Wednesday.  And they told me by next week, that is when the uptick is going to happen.  and uh yeah how interesting.  all i could say to you guys is be careful.  they told us Pre and post anesthesia, which is where I'm part of the anesthesia team, that we're, as of next week, starting Monday, we can't allow family members to come in to visit patients coming in and have surgery anymore because they're taking up part of our department for COVID cases.  This is really awful.  You know, I lost an uncle this way in March of 2020 who was supposed to have dialysis, but they didn't give it to him because of the Rona because of COVID and kept dying from it from freaking a potassium level of 7.3.  He ended up having a cardiac arrest.  So I'm seeing it from both ends.  So watch out for your families.  You know how they do.  They want to stop you from being around your family members so you won't see what's going on and advocate for them.  People aren't getting treatment like they're supposed to.  They're not.  They're not getting treatment at all.  One of our coworkers who works on the anesthesia team with us, her and her husband, tested positive for the rona.  they were having a little difficulty breathing and stuff so they admitted them two days later.  they're on the vent.  it has been a few months and they're still on the vent and all they're getting are breathing treatments.  they're not getting anything else.  so be careful out there all right.
