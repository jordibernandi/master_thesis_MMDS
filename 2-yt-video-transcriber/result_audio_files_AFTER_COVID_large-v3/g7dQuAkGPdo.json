Understandable, but sometimes you need to understand the fact that some people don't want to listen to that, and sometimes you need to respect that.  I understand.  I understand.  Just like this gentleman over here.  He said, oh, I don't want to talk to you.  Fine.  You don't want to talk to me?  That's fine.  But he was the one that first came and said, no, I want to know what's going on.  I want to know what's going on.  know because he saw this and obviously right now like obviously it doesn't matter which political side you're on it seems.  when somebody comes out with a different opinion obviously then everybody say he's harassing but if i have the same opinion then i'm good.  it's much more of making sure that everyone is like being safe like no one's going to come out and be like yo let's go.  oh no exactly.  and that's what these guys are here for.  but you know I don't think they should be here to overlook a constitutionally protected activity.  These guys are supposed to be looking for criminals, not with the guy exercising his right and with his camera phone, you know?  I can tell your sergeant, yeah, sure, go ahead.  I can tell your sergeant is not courteous and professional because the first approach, let me tell you, I do this for a living.  I go around the entire nation meeting public employees.  Look how many cops we have here right now.  We have one, two, three.  Oh, that's not a cop car, but I thought it was.  But they have a good job.  They get paid pretty good money.  So at least way over 50 grand a year at least.  So we have 50.  Let's say it was 50.  We have 50 plus 50 plus 50.  That's $150,000 in salaries right here.  And I'm sure it's more because this guy hasn't been a cop for two years.  He's been a cop for longer than that.  You've been a cop longer than that.  So you don't get paid $50,000 a year.  What do you hope to accomplish by being here today?  I hope to educate everyone on the First Amendment, on freedom of the press.  We have the right to speak.  We have the right to say how we feel.  We have the right to film in a publicly accessible area.  And if people don't like it, tough luck.  I'm not going to be disorderly.  I'm not going to be rude.  Although some people say, yeah, you're rude, but I can say F this and F that and I'm not.  So I'm pretty courteous.  I'd like to find out who called the cops on me.  Because that person is very, very, very uneducated.  This is for auditing America on every platform.  We have over 80 million combined views.  We're well known around the country.  Is it like corporate or is it like individually?  I'm independent.  Okay, I'm independent.  I'm independent.  Individual projects.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's what I meant.  I was just curious.  Yeah, I'm independent.  Like I said, I want no trouble.  I just speak.  I want people.

That's the meaning of disorderly conduct.  Once you have a police officer... Walking up to you like that, that's disorderly conduct.  Why do you think he didn't get my ID?
