I... The cognitive dissonance, man.  The cognitive dissonance.  How can you simultaneously take such pride in your weakness and then deride another man for being weak?  You are such a woman.  Not a good woman.  You are the type of bad woman that... That no one should give the time of day to but will because she's attractive.  That's what you are.  That is what you are.  You are so smarmy and nasty and you made it this far.  I don't know how you've made it this far.  Women make it this far because they're attractive and people want to have sex with them.

Now, again, the problem would be more... Having a relationship predicated on insecurity rather than stability, which is an unfortunate reality of how women operate.  Women are not creatures that operate on instability, they operate on insecurity.  A lot of the things that are motivating the woman is not a desire to create stable environments, but to satiate her insecure notions of herself.  So Elliot is just kind of doing what works here.  This is what works, but it's not really the way it should be.  And so those are two different things.  The way something should be is not the same as what works.  So what Elliot is trying to tell you is what works.  And what works is preying on women's insecurities, unfortunately.  I didn't make it this way.  It's just like, I just play the game, dude.  I didn't, I'm not the game designer.  Talk to women about that. ",

Now, I understand that N equals 2. considering the fact that these people found women that wanted to do it with them.  It greatly saddens me that his video has gotten over a million views, because all it's really done is just led people astray.  My more optimistic hope would be that some people would have watched this video and walked away from it saying, yeah, you're just being a snarky dickhead.  You're not making any valid points.  But I highly doubt that they do.  And I'm sure a million people are certainly going to watch my response to this shit.  It sucks.  It really does suck.  that you have another dude being so proud of being weak and effeminate.  And the worst thing about being effeminate is it's oftentimes the worst traits of being a woman, which is more than anything the real problem.  It's not the problem, it's not so much so far as you are adopting traits that are feminine, but it's the worst ones that you are adopting.  The passive aggressive attitude, The snarky disposition, the arrogance that does not allow you to accept something else that you don't like, the moral self-righteous ignatiation of your mere existence being enough to validate any opinion you have.  That right there, that's the problem, really.  And sure, I get it.  A lot of people don't really distill it as in this is a negative female trait.  The fact is, in principle, it's negative.  It's really the issue.  A lot of people are 100% putting it on, acting like a woman itself.  So a lot of people interpret it as a bad thing.  But hopefully you guys will recognize, you guys being the viewer, will recognize what the issue being.  And that is, again, adopting these negative traits more than anything else.  In conclusion, I want to say that it's okay to be a masculine man and it's okay to fail at being a masculine man.  What's not okay is to try to throw the whole concept out the window because you failed at it.  Because that's what this video really says to me.  This video says to me that he recognizes he failed at being a man or being a good man and so he's trying to destroy the entire archetype or the entire idea.  So there's no standard of which he could fail at.  Rather than challenge himself to be better or challenge the notion itself to create something better.  If there's no standard at all, you can't fail.  If I have to make my own standard, then that means I have to put in effort and I have to try to obtain it.  And that means, again, I can fail.  He wants to be in this wishy-washy area where he can just exist on the merit of his own existence and be validated.  I.e.,  like a woman.  And I'm not going to let that shit slide.  So with that being said, I just hope you guys got something out of today's video.  And if you did, man, go ahead and click the like button.  Yeah, shoot, go ahead and click that subscribe button.
