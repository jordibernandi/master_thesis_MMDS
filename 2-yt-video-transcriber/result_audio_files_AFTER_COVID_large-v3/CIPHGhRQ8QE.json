Some lady was standing five and a half feet away from me.  I don't know what to do anymore.  Who do I listen to?  Do I listen to the experts on TV or the experts on Facebook?  What happened to Dr.  Fauci?  How come he's not in the news conference anymore?  What did they do to Dr.  Fauci?  Oh, my God.  Did a spaceship land in the Rose Garden and take him away to a different planet?  Oh, my God.  I got to calm down.  I got to calm down.  Oh, my God.  What if the virus is out here?  What do I do with the gloves and the mask?  What if the virus is on these?  How do I get rid of them?  I don't want to throw them on the street.  That's not nice.  I'll get rid of it later.  Oh, my God.  I touched the steering wheel.  What if the virus is on the steering wheel now?  I just spit on the dashboard.  What if the virus is on the dashboard on the steering wheel?  Oh, my God.  I got to come back. ",
