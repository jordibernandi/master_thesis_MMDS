We give them a small electrical charge.  I'm just, act like a fertilized egg.  If I got a fertilized egg, all I need is a receiver in order to make it.  So they were hypnotizing women, you know, said they were being invaded by aliens.  And the fetus starts growing, right?  Needs food, where they can use cows and sheep too.  Again, a food source, that's all we need.  After about 14 weeks, all of a sudden that fetus is gone.  because they've learned to take, that's when the fetus starts developing its own blood supply.  Then they've used a pituitary hormone extract that they have, what accelerates the being that grows.  And the original technology was given to our government by the Grace.  Now, the reason was that our scientists were all excited because we could have spare parts.  If you need a heart or a liver or anything, you won't have any rejection.  It's your own DNA, right? ",

He had somebody else that was up there acting like he is and looked like it.  Even Hitler had a, you know, he had his standing.  In fact, his standing was the one that they found in the ground over in Germany.  I mean, Hitler and Eva and the dog and 14 other people got aboard a plane and flew down to Barcelona, Spain.

Okay, it's like Blade Runner, the android.  Exactly.  The only thing is that it's like this DVD recorder.  Sometimes you have glitches in it, so you have to have them tuned up occasionally or redone.  And so we take them to Camp David.  or there's a wing at Bethesda Hospital to just tell you.  If you go down there and check, you'll find the nurses, if they're willing to come forth, they'll tell you that they work on those people and they call them the others.  I thought it was interesting.  they're people.  remember these people can think and act but they don't have soul.  that's also prophesized right that's true that's true.  now we have another agenda that's going on so you have to be careful of all this.  there are many extraterrestrials that would like to be in on the game right now so they can sometimes will come into these physical beings that we've made to manipulate them.

            "text": "i see Once they cloned David Chappelle, then they killed David Chappelle.  Okay, and once they killed David Chappelle, that was it.  Now they could do anything.  It only takes a few hours to do this.  And once they did this, then they had full control of this new Dave Chappelle.  Old David, you know, his eyes, David had, you know, semi-big eyes, but his eyes were more slanted than bulged out eyes.  And David and I, we always talked about his weight.  And I was, Dave, you know, they said, no, cuz.  I don't want to be big.  I want to stay small.  Because I can run fast.  I can do things fast.  David never believed in being a big, husky-type person.  No, this new person here today, they have him as a big, husky-type person, like a bodybuilder.  His eyes are budging out of his head.  His neck is as big as one of the wrestlers' necks on WrestleMania.  You see, that's not, I'm telling you, you all can believe what you want to believe, but I know what I know.  The family, the Shapil family knows this.  This is not our family member.  Now, when they did, David made him a clone.  Now this is the thing now.  They knew that his wife and his children and his mother would know the difference.  If they had, once they cloned David Chappelle and sent this new Dave back home, they would know the difference.  This is not my husband.  This is not my father.  And this is not my son.  So what they had to do, they made threats.  to David earlier about taking out his wife, his children, and his mother.  They told David at one time, this was all after they asked David to quit smashing on the black race as far as the character that he was playing on the Chappelle show.  And they told David, too, that if he didn't stop, they would take out his mother, they would take out his wife, they would take out his children.  And so, now, they knew that once they combed this Dave or David, whatever you want to call him, but I know him as David, that once he goes back to Ohio, the family would know that this is not the man.  This is not, no, hell no, that ain't my husband.  Because then you have to go to, it's a man of Russia, Putin.  When his, because Putin is cloned too, whether you believe it or not, but you do get research to find out these things down here.  And when Putin is cloned, his wife said when they when they send them back home she said she got on the front of the cameras.  she told everybody this man is not my husband.  she said no this is not my husband this is a different man.  and she saw the difference that they that this man had had bought for.  well she was beginning to run her mouth a little bit too much.  so what did they do?  not they didn't do it until Putin's wife was going to divorce Putin.  And so what did they do?  They cloned her.  They cloned her.  And now if you ask her if Putin is her husband, she'll tell you, yes, that's my husband.  And if you do your research on it, you'll find statements and bulletins where she said, At one time, that's not my husband.  I don't know who this man is.  This is an imposter that I'm living with.  And, you know, do the research and find out what she's saying.  And so they figured if they sent David back home to his wife, his children, and his mother, they would say the same thing.  So they had to do something.  And so what they did.  before they sent David back home to his family, they cloned his wife, Elaine.  They cloned his children and they cloned his mama, my aunt.  And they cloned all of them.  And so now they were able to send David back home to them.  And they don't know the difference.  And you know why they don't know the difference?  Because they all have been cloned.  They all have been cloned.  So like you did with Princess Diana.  Princess Diana knew so much.  And what did they do?  They cloned her.  But see, the brain part of Princess Diana, the original, came into the brain of the cloned Diana.  And so the cloned Diana, as you know, Princess Diana, the original one, you know, she used to crawl all the time.  Do your research now.  She was a crawler at times.  She would wipe away tears and that sort of thing.  And so the clone Diana did the same thing.  And Queen Elizabeth had taken this so long, so much.  And they were on the shore.  They were unassured if the clone Diana would take on the bicep of the original Diana by going and telling the things that she knew.  That she knew that the original Diana knew.  So what did Queen Elizabeth, she didn't directly do it, but she had the order to sit down.  And so what did they do?  They had her killed in a car accident to kill off the clones.  So there will be no more Dianas to speak of.  He has no soul.  He has no spirit.  Sure, he can eat and drink like anybody else.  Like you and I can.  He can drink like you and I can.  He can bleed like you and I can.  But the thing about it, he has no soul and no spirit.  These type of clones are called synthetic robotoids.  And that's what David, this new David Chappelle is.  He's a synthetic robotoid.  That's what Britney Spears is.  That's what all the other of these singers and actors and actresses and comedians, that's what all of them are.  They have warned each and every one, they have told each and every one of them, each and every one of us.  How, you know, they hate.  they got into the business.  Kanye West has said the same thing.  Kanye West has spoken about, you know, how he gave up his mother as a sacrifice.  How, you know, he, you know, how the business is.  He has told us about that.  Britney Spears and, you know, I could go on and this and this and this.  But there's so many.  You see what I'm saying?  But David, he tried to tell people about the business.  Thank you. ",
