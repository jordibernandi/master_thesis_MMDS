            "text": "Hi, and welcome to another episode of Redeeming Truth.  I'm here at Redeemer Bible Church with my good friend and pastor, John Benzinger, and we want to address a listener question.  Somebody wrote in and said, can you expand, please, on your church's position and just the position at large for what is complementarianism in the pulpit or in the pastorate, the question really was, can a woman be a pastor?  And if you say no, why not?  What would be the case for that?  And so I thought we would just in a brief episode address this.  We're not looking to throw stones.  We're not looking to blow things up with controversy.  Our church highly esteems women.  We have incredible women who serve and lead here, and we could not do what we do without them as spiritual equals and incredible.  We have wives who we love.  And so let me preface this by saying this is no doormat theological position or some misogynistic attempt to be dominant in today's world.  this is just about the Bible and it's about roles.  And so, Pastor John, would you expand?  Can a woman, biblically speaking, operate in the office of elder or the function of a pastor with that authoritative role in a church?  And if no or if yes, why not or why? ",

            "text": "Yeah, so that's, thanks for an easy one.  We have a... We have a culture that is really not excited about anything the Bible teaches, including what the Bible teaches on this subject.  So as Bible guys, as guys who love the Bible and our value is the Bible determines everything here, as our highest authority, sola scriptura, so the idea there being, okay, we've gotta go with what the Bible says.  And so even though our culture is pushing us violently even to alter, to soften, to say, yeah, it doesn't really mean that, we're all going to be tested and tempted to do that on various issues.  And this is one of them.  And so when it comes to the answer to your question, which is, can a woman... Christian, be a pastor or an elder in the church?  The answer from the Bible is no, they can't.  And you said why?  It goes all the way back to creation.  God in creation created men and women, Christian men and women, men and women united under the authority of God to follow certain roles that he has given them.  Going all the way back to Genesis, all the way back to creation before sin entered the world.  So you see in the early chapters of Genesis, especially Genesis chapter two, that those roles come up.  But in Genesis chapter one, it's equally in the image of God for men and women, equal in value, equal in deserving of respect, equal in dignity.  So while different roles exist for men and women in the Christian home and in the Christian church, there is an equality, what we are as human beings.  There's an equality before Christ.  We are equally saved, Galatians 3.28.  And so within that sense, we are, that would be my answer for you. ",

We see that in the marriage covenant for men and women, that men and women, while equal and spiritual equals, there's a role.  And where the Bible says that a woman is to submit to her husband, her own husband, by the way, not all men and not anyone's husband, but her own.  And a man is to lead in love and like Christ, of course, in Ephesians 5.  I think roles are a normal part of God's order.  Roles are a normal part of sports teams even.  Roles are a part of any organization.  I think God in his wisdom certainly did establish clear roles. ",

You have 1 Timothy chapter 2.  But then we have the qualifications for pastors or elders in 1 Timothy 3, and you actually preached on Titus 1, the qualifications there.  And we'll put that sermon and a link to it in the info and even on the screen so people can watch the sermon.  It was very well done, and you went through those qualifications.

You have Jesus choosing 12 disciples who are all men.  Those were the ones who would then be leaders in the church in the book of Acts and beyond.  And so this has been the consistent teaching of the Christian church for 2000 years.  This is the majority position still today within organizations that call themselves Christian.  So this is not a novel view.  This isn't some weird kind of offshoot view.  This is the major view because it's taught in the Bible so clearly and so obviously.  This has always been the major view.

And so I don't wanna sound like those things don't happen.  Those things absolutely happen.  But what I wanna say is that's not because there is something deficient in the doctrine.  That's something deficient in the man, in the leader, in the husband.  The doctrine, there's nothing wrong with it at all, but the application of that in sinful hearts, who are, as we see from Genesis 3, who are prone to be dominant, that is absolutely going to be something that the Christian man is going to have to fight because what he is told is to love his wife like Christ loves the church, who gave himself for her, who sacrificed for her.  He's there to nourish her and cherish her.  Abuse is the exact opposite of those things.  So to say that, well, this is a problem with the doctrine, it's not the problem with the doctrine.  It's a problem with sinful hearted men who are applying the doctrine sinfully. ",

I heard you preach a sermon at a men's conference on 1 Peter 3 about considering one's wife, being sensitive.  and you go to 1 Peter 3, 7, and God basically says, I don't even hear your prayers.  Your prayers, if you're an abusive man and sensitive to your wife, a lack of consideration, your prayers are just hitting the ceiling.  I mean, you don't even need to pray, God, fix her.  What's wrong with this woman?  Why doesn't she submit to you?  God is basically saying, or has said in his word, you're the problem.  And so men, to that point, must follow God's design in order to be lovers, protectors, sensitive, caring, kind leaders, leaders who lead from sacrifice.  Speak to the other side though, because our culture that we have a wave of feminism, that's the opposite of maybe not male abusers, but men haters and male haters.  Speak to that briefly. ",

It came from a heart of rebellion against the Bible and even against men who were applying the Bible sinfully.  And so that would be the first thing I would say.  The second thing I would say is that there is a... Because we are... men and women equally in the image of God, there is prohibition against misogyny, which is hatred for women, and misanthropy, hatred for men.  So our culture is rampant with man-hating.  It is rampant with it.  You cannot say the same thing about men, women, that you say about men in our culture.  You just can't.  Why?  Because it's okay in our culture to hate men.  Our culture stands condemned by what the Bible says about men being in the image of God.

Because God... didn't say maybe that women can't lead or they're just to cook and clean and kind of be chained to the stove so to speak.  Could a woman be a CEO conceivably and a Christian man in a church who is used to submitting to elders or even let's say someone was a bivocational elder and they hold authority in a church as a man, Could they then go and work for Pepsi or whoever or one of these companies with a woman CEO?  And would God, by his word, require that man to operate in a way that is submissive to a woman boss in the world system, even if he was a bivocational elder who does not submit necessarily to a woman on the elder board at his church?

Those are the spheres that we see in the New Testament.  And so the way I want to answer that question is if you are a Christian working outside of church, the Christian church, you're working for a business that's either Christian or non-Christian, just neutral, then you submit to the structures that are in place at the job that you're at or find a new job.  It's that simple.  So even if you're an elder, even if you're a bivocational pastor, you are to submit to the people that God has put in authority over you.  Or like I said, we don't live in a country where you're forced to have the job that you have.  Go find a new job if that violates your conscience.  But at the end of the day, what we're talking about from the New Testament is in the Christian home and in the Christian church.  So we shouldn't be surprised that organizations outside the Christian church and non-Christian homes don't function this way.  They don't want to function this way.  They're going to rebel against functioning that way.  Well, of course they are.  But we as Christians are to submit ourselves to what the scripture says in context, face value, literal interpretation.  That's what we should do. ",

So there is a gradation of, okay, so you have Acts 18, 24, Priscilla and Aquila taught Apollos the way of God more accurately.  So there they are in a small group, husband and wife teaching another man the Bible.

We've been going through the book of Titus at a snail's pace because he likes to preach verse by verse, literally.  And it's been incredible.  We've been so blessed.  He took a deep dive into the qualifications of elders.  So if you're on the fence on this issue, or you're unsure if the church you're at is faithful on this issue, or just in general... You hold a view of egalitarianism or you say, you know, I'm a woman pastor, whatever.  And you want to just look at what the other side is from a fair and kind and gracious approach.  There is a charitable spirit that we want to have.  And so see what God's word says and be sharpened by it.  Well, John, thank you as always.  Love you.  Appreciate you.
