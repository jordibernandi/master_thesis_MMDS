I just wanted to let you know that you have a lot of supporters in India and a lot of these outspoken people that are just rallying against you, posting stuff about your loved ones and all that crap.  It's just a very tiny, vocal minority of people.  That is what religion does to people, right?  So I wanted to support you.  And for the first time in my life, I've joined Patreon.  So I'm one of your patrons now.  And you know what?  I just want you to know that I really support you.  And we have a lot of supporters from India.  So yeah, that's all.  Keep being yourself.  And let's just do some more blushing, right?  Okay. ",

Why do you people comment on Hinduism when your own people keep murdering, knifing, knife people shamelessly?  just for even if we sort of reply to your vulgar comments and point out what your gods are why do you sort of go and knife them kill them but you dare to sort of talk about hinduism hindus whether hindus should revolt for any comments.  have anyone ever killed anybody just for speaking out against our gods?  have some shame.  you're really typical coward calling yourself atheist but then you just poke your.  I mean, dig into all aspects of conversations about religion and especially anti-Hinduism.  Aren't you shameless?  If you're really pro-Islamic, just say out, no, why do you want to sort of call yourself atheist and then comment about Hinduism?  Have some shame.  Morons you are really. ",

            "text": "Hi, to whoever this may concern, I am actually speaking from India.  I sent you an email regarding the same.  I came across one of your t-shirts for, I think it was Kali and Sita, two Indian goddesses we worship.  And I'm sorry, I could not resist myself from sending you a voicemail.  That was extremely offensive.  And, you know, I understand that and I respect your ideologies and I respect what your page runs on.  However, what you said about our goddesses in the form of a picture, the depiction was not appropriate at all.  You need to realize and understand that if you are taking into consideration an atheist community, Propagating your own community doesn't mean you insult the other person's community or their faith.  If you have faith in something, it's not necessary for you to pull the other person down.  That's exactly how feminism works.  If you're not a feminist and if you're an atheist, I mean, I don't know, it kind of seems off.  So, you know... I just wanted to convey this message that, you know, anyone from the Indian community, be it a Hindu, be it a Muslim, be it a Christian, anyone that has lived in India at least for a year or two, does understand and realize the fact that this is extremely offensive.  Not only because of the fact that it is sexualizing our gods, but also because of the fact that you are propagating something that is a very big problem in our country.  We have the highest number of rapes.  India.  and by creating t-shirts like this you are actually sending a message to the youth.  in some ways you are trying to send them send a message that oh you know what it's okay to live in India it's all right and it may not seem like a very big problem to you but as a woman I'm 19 years old right now as a woman living in this country I can tell you that it's not a joke.  It's not funny.  It's not atheism.  This is not what atheism is.  Atheism is when it's backed by science.  You want to explain why you don't believe in God?  Explain it through science.  Explain it through stuff like, okay, you know what?  The Big Bang Theory exists.  The black hole exists or whatever the fuck you do.  But don't do this because this is not acceptable.  And imagine I tear your mother's clothes off and put a picture of her in front of you kissing some other girl.  Okay, I don't have a problem with anyone being a lesbian.  I completely support LGBTQ.  But would you like to imagine your mother's image all across the internet, naked, kissing a woman?  In fact, not just your mother, just anyone, any woman you know.  Would you like to imagine that?  We worship our goddesses because we treat them as our mothers.  And we were offended when we saw that.  Your community is supposed to make atheists feel better and not people who worship gods feel offended and worse about their religion.  And it's not supposed to propagate rape.  What you're doing here is actually propagating rape.  So please do something about it.  pull it down i don't know.  i'll issue an apology at least and whoever the artist is a big you to you you republican people you guys have no balls huh? ",
