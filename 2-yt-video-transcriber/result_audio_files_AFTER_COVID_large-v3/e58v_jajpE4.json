            "text": "In early 2019, Pixar Animation Studios began releasing a new series of movies to the public.  Titled Spark Shorts, the series features animated short films that Pixar employees were tasked to create in only six months and with limited budgets.  The first three entries in the series were given a limited release at the El Capitan Theatre on January 8, 2019, before the first film, Pearl, was officially released on YouTube on February 4, 2019.  As more shorts were released, the series would eventually be moved to Disney+, with the launch of the new streaming service.  The Spark Shorts series does a wonderful job of showing what Pixar has accomplished as an animation studio.  Each short brings a different story, environment, and art style.  that reminds me of why I love Pixar so much.  They're able to deal with a variety of subjects in a way that feels accessible and engaging from many perspectives and age groups.  A lot of their animated films are considered some of the most effective all-ages content of the last 20 years, and though they're not above criticism, it's clear that they stand out among their competitors.  When I read that a new installment in the Spark Shorts series called Out would focus specifically on a man coming out to his family, I didn't know what to expect.  As I spoke about in my video on Ferdinand.  the Bull, media that falls under the Disney umbrella has always had a complicated relationship with the LGBTQ community.  Though there have been attempts in the past to proclaim that there are openly LGBTQ characters, the inclusion of those characters only feels performative when you consider the fact that they're easy to miss even if you're looking for them.  However, this time it's different.  Out is a touching, wonderful film about a man coming out to his family that feels both personal and universal.  Directed by Stephen Clay Hunter, the film feels like a necessary step in the right direction for positive LGBTQ representation within Disney-owned media.  There are many things that make the short film work so well, but I believe that sound is one of the most important ones.  Let's talk about why. ",

            "text": "It's fun, it's fun, it's fun.  To be free, but to be free.  Out was released on Disney Plus on May 22nd, 2020.  There will be spoilers from this point on, so you've been warned.  The film centers around the main character, Greg.  As he is preparing to move to his city with his boyfriend Manuel, his parents pay him a visit to help him pack everything up.  Throughout the course of the short, Greg deals with some cosmic forces that eventually lead him to come out to his parents about his relationship.  If you want to get the full scope of what went into this cartoon, I highly recommend you watch the whole thing for yourself.  At its core, Out is a pretty authentic portrayal of a coming out experience.  Granted, it's only one type of coming out experience, but it never pretended to be anything else.  Though the direct happy ending after coming out isn't something I can personally relate to, I really appreciate how the film builds up the tension leading to the big coming out moment.  Throughout the short, the score by Jake Monaco does a great job of setting up the environment and narrative.  Quirky musical segments help provide a sense of lightness to the action that allows the short to transition from comedy to drama and back in a way that feels seamless.  Even when the score is accompanying dramatic moments, it feels like a natural progression that is serving the momentum of the dialogue.  However, the score isn't the main reason why I'm making this video.  I really do love the music by Jake Monaco, but the sound design by Adrian Maruri is what affected me on a very personal level.  For starters, let's define what I mean when I say sound design.  Technically speaking, sound design is the process of specifying, acquiring, manipulating, or generating audio elements.  In other words, sound design is the process of creating a sound world that a piece of art occupies.  In theater, the role of a sound designer usually involves working with speakers, assembling incidental music for the show, and creating the sound world that the actors exist in.  For example, in 2018, the Massachusetts-based organization Shakespeare & Company staged a production of Creditors by August Strindberg.  My husband, John McDermott, was asked to do the set design, so he started where he always does, reading the script and doing research.  In this situation, John's role as a set designer was to create a livable space for the play to exist in.  Part of his craft is to have a sense of intuition for what a livable space looks like.  It's much more than simply putting chairs and tables in a room.  The floor needs to be properly scuffed to look like people have walked on it.  Items on tables need to not only match the personalities of the characters, but also look used.  On top of this, all of the furniture and design had to represent Scandinavian design of the late 1800s.  In order to set the scene accurately with the materials available in western Massachusetts, John had to do a great deal of research and visiting antique shops all over the state in order to curate props that fit his set design.  The sound design had to be curated in a similar way.  In order to immerse audiences in a play that took place in a Scandinavian beachside hotel in the late 1800s, sound designer Amy Altadonna had to carefully craft the soundscape for the play to exist in.  It's very likely that visitors will hear waves and seagulls while at a beach resort, but it's also very likely that those sounds will sound different in Scandinavia than they do on the east coast of the United States.  To get the right sounds, Amy had to use her intuition and sound designer expertise to curate sounds from Scandinavian vacation videos to create an authentic environment.  While the characters in the play argued, the sound design acted as if it was its own character.  These sounds were then mixed and integrated into a sound design thanks to her production skills.  Someone would exit, leaving the others in silence while waves and beach sounds were quietly mixed in the background.  In animation, sound design serves a similar purpose to what it does in theater.  Because the setting is inherently artificial, it's the job of the designer to create a sonic environment that helps immerse the audience.  This can be anything from curating sounds to creating your own sounds as a foley artist or other things.  In my interview with Greg Meter, sound designer and ex-imagineer for Disney, he even shared an anecdote with me regarding his work on the original Tower of Terror attraction.  He even tried to use real elevator noises, but they didn't sound convincing enough, so he had to create his own sounds that audiences would recognize as elevator noises.  In the case of Out, Adrian Maruri had to conceptualize and curate sounds that represented the seemingly North American suburban setting of the film.  It's impossible to know exactly how all of the sounds were created without asking Maruri, but that's not the point.  When you hear a person run or a door shut, Maruri has chosen a sound to go along with that gesture that combines with the animation to make it feel real.  However, it goes so much deeper than that.  Maruri's work on Out not only sets up the sonic environment for the narrative, but also the emotional tension within it.  When Greg's mother is lamenting how she feels distant from her son, there's no music in the background.  only the slight purring of the wind and the dialogue.  The sound design wraps around the dialogue, accompanying it and facilitating the drama.  There's a stereotype in music that loudness is equivalent to drama.  However, the sound design in Out is an argument for the exact opposite.  The quiet sounds bring out the tension in each scene.  There might be no music underneath Greg's mom's dialogue, but the spaces in between her words and how they interact with the sound design help us understand just how lost and let down she feels.  When the score slowly starts to come in at an emotional turn, it only becomes more intense.  This also works really well in the minute or so before Greg decides to come out.  The squeaking of the Wheezy toy interacts with the action-packed score, having the real-world sounds align with the music.  However, when it all comes crashing down and Greg switches back to his own body, there's just silence.  Between the dog panting, the wind blowing, and the mother's body moving as she leans in to ask, what is wrong with you?  The tension is intimate.  As Greg lightly handles the photo while looking at himself and Manuel, it's clear that he's about to tell them something.  To hear him reply nothing feels like a release.  He's finally allowed to share himself with his family.  As a queer person, this is a moment I relate to intimately.  It may not have been the exact same situation, but I'll never forget the first time that I actually came out to somebody in person.  I asked my friend to follow me to a band room during our school lunch break and told him the news.  However, it wasn't that simple.  It took at least a minute of me murmuring to get out the words.  In that minute, I also became acutely aware of my surroundings.  The wrinkles in my shirt, my uneven breathing, the slight whir of a fan, and the footsteps of people walking by the classroom.  It was like my ability to hear had become incredibly intense as I took note of every detail in the situation.  Once I said I was gay, the words came out like a sigh that was reflected in my perception of the sounds around me.  To feel a similar intensity from this moment in and out is truly remarkable to me.  Sound design is a type of art form that is almost unnoticeable when it's done well, leading some people to not be aware of how much goes into it.  However, in this situation, it's one of the most important characters in the story.  Even if you're someone who hasn't experienced coming out, it's likely that you can understand the intensity of that moment just by listening.  That is what I love so much about Adrian Maruri's sound design for Out.  It helps this beautiful short film take incredibly personal moments and make them accessible.  And I hope that's a step in the right direction for positive LGBTQ representation.  To learn more about the art of sound design, I spoke with Amy Altadano, sound designer for the production of Creditors that I mentioned earlier in this video.  Alongside her design work, she's also a lecturer in the sound design and technology department at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.  Amy was very kind to share insight on the importance of sound design and what it means to listen. ",

            "text": "very self-centered.  And I think that's evident.  I'm serious.  I mean, I guess I understand sound design and intimacy when I perform, but that's entirely dependent on me as a person.  And it's dependent on me having creative control over every aspect.  I think that's why I was never a good classical musician, because it was hard for me to use that musicality that I developed And it was hard for me to find that within the performance practice.  I think in terms of design, to be able to understand existence and sound in a way that I feel like is very nuanced, to be able to understand sound on a level to the point where you're able to adjust based on somebody else, I think that takes a great deal of intuition.  You have to know a hell of a lot more than just your experience. ",

            "text": "I think what you described is so succinctly the difference between a composer or an artist... and a designer.  Some designers are artists and they can say, you know, that's all great.  For me, the reason that I'm not sitting around composing all day is because I am not that.  I actually really need something coming in to respond to, I have these kind of raw materials that I'm going to craft around other people's things that they have crafted.  There's a Duplass Brothers movie where Mark plays a sound designer for film and he goes out and records a coyote yelping.  And the director's like, what the heck is that?  Because it was a coyote, but it's not what we think a coyote sounds like.  And so that's tricky, too, is to thread the needle between research, accuracy, my knowledge, observations of the world, and then what is my audience going to associate with these choices?  But I also think telling people, wherever you are, go sit outside and close your eyes.  And just keep listening.  And listen for what's close.  Maybe even sounds that are like what's happening in you.  My stomach rumbled.  I'm hearing the of my blood in my ears.  There's something right next to me that's making a little noise.  There's a bee buzzing around and I heard a crinkle in the leaves.  Oh, there are leaves kind of moving in the breeze out there, trying to identify what's man-made, what's human, what's natural.  I don't know.  I just feel like you can hear the sound design of the world at any time.  And the more you sensitize yourself to that, I think the more you can appreciate things that happen.  And I think Out teaches us the power of that because there are these really big moments.  Like, could you watch that for nine minutes with your eyes closed and you hear the dog hit the wall and how real that sounds?  You know, listening to things with your eyes closed could be a useful tool to help people start to notice and appreciate sound.  The other thing you notice when you close your eyes is You know, we do take so many sounds for granted because they accompany motions, actions, visuals, right?  Like in film, but in real life too.  And they're so integrated that we don't notice them.  But yes, if we were to go back and watch out with our eyes closed, I know that there would be things that even I'm not noticing.  All of a sudden you would think, oh yeah, a dog's toenails on the floor really say a lot.  You know, scramble, scramble, scramble, or, you know, trying to get to the thing.  Sound creates real characterization and contains a lot of expression that we sort of attribute to looking at something.  But the shaping of sound carries so much of a nonverbal language.  Like, can I pick out that thing or can I shape that sound to tell somebody something right to their heart through their ears? ",
