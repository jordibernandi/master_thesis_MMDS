            "text": "You know, one of the great things about working in conservative media is that I don't have to take any insufferable, horrible diversity and inclusion HR training courses at work that a lot of people have to be subjected to.  I've never been subjected to that from our HR department, but many of you have had to endure it.  So I thought that today... Maybe as an act of solidarity, because I'm such a generous person, I would endure some of this training to see what it's like, just to see how the other half lives, and perhaps to offer my own review of it, I guess, shall we say.  So this is from a company called mTrain, which according to the website VentureBeat.com is, quote, a startup providing online education and guidance on human resources and compliance topics.  Among their clients are Dolby, Live Nation, Netflix, Yelp, BuzzFeed, and the New York Times.  Maybe at your own job, you've had to sit through videos like this.  Maybe if you work at one of those places, you're probably not watching my videos.  But either way, if you have had to watch these, you have my condolences.  Now, M-Train has all their videos proudly displayed on their YouTube channel where they generously allow you to watch it for free.  So you don't even have to work at one of these places to do it.  So in your free time, if you're wondering... you know, what you can do to be more diverse and inclusive in your personal life, you can always go to this channel, check out their offerings.  They've got videos on, what do they got?  Workplace harassment.  They've got videos.  Those are probably good.  They've got stuff on sexism in the workplace.  They've got some HIPAA compliance videos.  We might skip those.  I don't know.  Today, we're going to skim through their Managing Unconscious Bias playlist.  how to manage your unconscious bias.  Because you can't get rid of your unconscious bias.  You just got to learn to live with it and manage it, right?  So they've got many offerings in this genre.  We'll watch maybe a few of them today.  And we'll start with this.  This is a video called Examples of Unconscious Bias Pattern Matching.  So the idea here is a little confusing at first, but they show us a scenario.  And then you jump to the wrong conclusion about that scenario based on stereotypes because you're a worthless bigot.  And then we find out what was really happening.  Okay, so that's basically how this works.  And let's take a look.  All right, let's see this.  Um, it's the dry cleaners down on Mission.  Two blocks up.  You know, you know, you know.  I need the red shirt and we'll see you later.  All right.  Okay.  We'll just stop there for a second because what the hell kind of dry cleaning transaction is that?  That's what I want to know.  So I'm supposed to feel bad because I saw the two guys whispering in a corner and exchanging wads of cash on a street corner and I didn't immediately assume it was a dry cleaning thing.  You're going to blame me for that.  That's my fault?  No, I'm not unconsciously biased for not taking the dry cleaning possibility into consideration initially.  That doesn't make me biased.  I'm just a sane, rational person.  And I have lived in the world.  And I know that usually when two guys are on a street corner whispering and exchanging money, it's not because one of them wants their shirt ironed.  But very often, sane rationality is confused with bias these days.  And the thing is, it's also, this is one of my problems.  It's dangerous to tell people not to make common sense assumptions about in the world.  We do have to make assumptions about people and they're not always gonna be flattering assumptions.  Like if you're heading into a part of town where you're going for a jog or something and you end up at a part of town where you see a lot of guys on street corners taking wads of cash from random people and then handing them unknown objects which they discreetly tuck away in their pocket, it's probably safest to turn around and head in the other direction rather than assuming that this is just a part of town where everybody really likes to have their pants properly pressed.  So this has gotten off to a stupid, stupid start already.  As stupid as expected, I guess.  Let's try a new video.  This one is called, this is called examples of microaggressions in the workplace.  All right.  So the famous microaggressions, we've all heard about them.  Now we get to see an example of them.  Let's watch this.  It looks crazy.  It looks like a mess.  I don't believe it.  Your hair always looks awesome.  I mean, how do you do it?  Do you twist it?  Do you do it yourself?  Yeah, I twist it myself.  Oh, I mean, do you mind?  Oh, oh.  Yeah, actually, I do mind.  Oh, sorry.  But I mean, if you're really curious about it, there are tons of YouTube videos out now about natural hair, so maybe check that out.  Okay.  So that's a microaggression.  I still don't know what a microaggression is.  I just watched an example of it.  I'm not even sure who committed the microaggression.  There was a microaggression floating around there somewhere.  I'm not sure who it's emanating from.  Now, I agree that it's weird for someone to want to touch your hair.  I don't want someone touching any part of me in the workplace.  But haven't you just made it a hell of a lot more awkward by turning it into a big deal and then telling them to consult YouTube?  So you're the one who's made this awkward.  It was already a little bit awkward.  You've just ramped the awkward up to level 10 now.  Before it was like a three or four.  Now it's a 10 because of you.  Someone says, hey, can I touch your hair?  No, but there are YouTube videos for hair touching freaks like yourself.  Might want to check some of those out.  See, it seems like the response is even weirder than the initial request.  And at any rate, how does that count as a microaggression?  The white lady was trying to pay the black lady a compliment about her hair, maybe awkwardly, but not every awkward human interaction or clumsy comment or even impolite action is a microaggression.  Sometimes it's just someone being awkward or impolite.  It happens.  It happens in the world.  In fact, nothing that happens ever is a microaggression because that's a made-up category and it doesn't mean anything.  There are more examples with this video, so let's keep going.  How do people at work sit through this and just keep their mouth shut?  I wouldn't be able to do it.  I couldn't physically do it.  Okay, another microaggression.  Let's keep going.  There's no way we were going to make it to that date.  No.  I have no idea what they were thinking.  What are you doing this weekend?  Going to the beach with some buddies.  Dude, sunscreen, you've already got quite the tan.  Where's your family from?  Here.  Yeah, but before here, where are they from?  Still here.  But before that?  A few generations from here.  Cool, sorry.  OK.  So, number one, the guy who we can assume it's not always clear where the microaggression is, but we can.  we can just assume that if it's a white and nonwhite person, the nonwhite person is supposed to be the victim of it.  So we just assume that to begin with.  But he really is 100% the jerk in this situation in so many ways.  Number one, they're sitting down in a cafeteria or something, and he's on his phone the whole time.  So if there is a microaggression in existence, that's one.  You're sitting with someone.  There's only one other person at the table.  They're trying to communicate with you.  You dummy, put your phone down.  But then also, he just made a completely normal, innocuous, inoffensive exchange into something aggressive and weird.  There was nothing weird about what she said.  Because you know what she means.  She's saying, where are you from?  I'm from here.  I'm also from here.  You know what she means.  Yeah, she's asking about your ethnicity.  She is.  That's what she's doing.  So?  What's wrong with that?  Why can't we ask that question?  Someone explain to me why we can't ask that.  I mean, I notice that you are of a different ethnicity.  I can physically see it.  Am I not supposed to notice it?  Or do you want to be invisible?  Because then you're being otherized, aren't you?  Then you're being excluded and marginalized if we don't notice.  So I notice I can't say anything.  I can't be interested.  She's interested in you, dummy.  Who knows?  I mean, she's she's she's especially.  you're a man as a woman.  She's interested in you.  Maybe put the phone down, have a conversation.  There's not gonna be any second date, I can tell you that.  Are you ashamed of your ethnicity?  Like, you know, the other day someone asked me, they said they asked me, oh, your last name's Walsh.  Does that mean your family's from Ireland?  I didn't say, how dare you?  How dare you ask me that question?  No, I smacked them over the head with a whiskey bottle and danced a jig because that's what Irish people do.  That was my response.  So we're supposed to celebrate diversity and embrace people of all races and all nations and all creeds.  But we can never audibly acknowledge or ask questions about or be interested in those differences.  Is that what we're saying?  So this is not a microaggression.  This is not a microaggression.  This is just a plain old regular aggression by the guy towards the girl because he's the jerk.  So let's look at one more.  There's only so much I can stomach of this, but we'll do.  I got to check this one out because this is this one is titled Examples of Unconscious Racial Bias in the Workplace.  So not just bias, but now we're getting particularly racial bias.  That doesn't sound good.  Racial bias in the workplace.  We don't want any of that.  So let's watch this and see what that looks like.  Bro, I'm better than you at 2K.  Bro, talk to Max.  I've been playing for longer than you have been alive.  Bro, what's good?  What's good?  What's good?  Bro, what's good?  Play me tonight.  Play me tonight, bro.  Play me tonight.  What's good?  Monica.  You made it.  Of course.  I wouldn't miss our victory lunch.  We worked our butts off on that project.  Right?  Am I the first?  Tim and Sonia just texted.  They are on their way.  We haven't gotten to the climax of this scene yet, but I need to stop just as an aside and mention that the acting is very subpar in this scene.  in this skit.  I mean, none of the acting has been great, but this is like a skit I might've seen on the morning announcements in high school.  That's the level of acting that we're getting here.  Have some pride in your unconscious bias skits, M train.  That's what I'm trying to say.  Hire some real actors.  I'm having trouble getting invested in the storyline right now because they're, they're basically, you know, they're, they're taking me out of the moment with their bad acting.  So that's a problem, but we'll keep going.  They are on their way.  Great.  I want to celebrate everyone's hard work on this project.  You guys did such a good job.  I really appreciate it.  You bet.  I'm just glad we made it.  Can I get you something to drink?  Oh, just water for now.  But you might want to tell your manager about those guys out front.  Kind of intimidating.  Maybe have the police move them along or something.  Sure.  I'll talk to my manager.  Great.  What are you doing?  What?  Call the police?  Over those kids outside?  I'm sorry, I'm not trying to offend anyone, but those kids can just hang out on some other street corner.  Oh, I see.  You see the tall one out there?  That's my son, Michael.  We're going shopping for prom clothes right after we're done.  God, I am so sorry.  I just heard on the news that someone was mugged over here and... You thought my son did it?  No, of course not.  God, you don't think that I... You know what I think?  I think this celebration is over.  Thanks.  Oh, that's your son, is it?  Well, he's an unruly hooligan, ma'am.  That's the problem with your son.  The kid just slammed the woman against the wall and didn't even apologize.  Once again, the bad guy is the good guy is the bad guy in this in this skit.  Once again, they slammed her against the wall, didn't apologize.  And now she's the bad guy.  My only problem with the hapless white patsies in all these videos is that they don't defend themselves.  That's the real lesson.  That's my takeaway.  You know, when you're being berated by some obnoxious, overly sensitive jerk, defend yourself.  Speak up.  How about saying to her, hey, lady, your son is out there shoving women into walls.  OK, maybe he needs a kick in the ass, not a trip to the tuck store for prom.  Have you considered that?  If that was my mother and I was a kid and I just shoved a woman into the... First of all, in that situation, if you're a good mother and someone comes in and says they want to call the cops on your son, at least I know with my mom when I was a kid, her first reaction would have been, what did he do?  I know he did something.  What was it?  Instead, her immediate reaction is to assume, he couldn't possibly have done anything.  My little angel, I know he didn't do anything.  This is bad, neglectful parenting.  That's what this is.  And that's the lesson for us.  That's what I take from this video.  Bad parenting.  But also, don't allow yourself to be bullied by people who are angling to be the victim.  That's the real lesson.  And also, don't work at companies that make you watch videos like this.  I don't know how people do it.  That is, unless they're putting them on for a laugh, so you can all sit around and laugh at them, in which case, that would be an awesome company to work for. ",
