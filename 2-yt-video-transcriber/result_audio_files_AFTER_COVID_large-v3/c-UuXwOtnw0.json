You're working on your inner strength, mentally, emotionally, spiritually, getting ready for these days ahead.  I'm just making this quickly because I found a video the other day I created the other day, actually, that completely blew me away.  And it's a little bit criminal that he's only got 37,000 subscribers.  He makes some of the most amazing documentaries or short films that I've seen.  And I think in this time that we're dealing with, and it is really good to see whether it's companies like Gab or individual people like Zachary here, Corey, some of the people I know, and the people that are just continuously speaking the truth, trying to educate the world on these agendas that we're facing and the future that we could be facing.  So when I find one of these, I really want to try to plug them so all of you can go over and follow them.  Let's watch this clip together and just see how he absolutely nails it on the head. ",

            "text": "The dark winter came after the first pandemic, and while everybody was paralyzed from fear of the virus, we had something far greater that we were unprepared for.  Cyber Polygon was the largest cyber attack ever to be executed.  The world's internet was collapsed intentionally, and all of our rights to information were cut off.  Banking, medical records, all databases were heavily attacked.  Power grids were shut down, businesses were finished, Economies collapsed, forcing us closer and closer to the Great Reset.  Most were not prepared for this annihilation and were now frozen within the illusion of democracy.  The puppets performed on stage while we watched impassively.  We had entered the dark winter without any awareness.  When the attack finally came, it moved at lightning speed.  The military were brought in to keep order on the streets.  to assist the understaffed police.  With the huge cut in funding, institutions broke down resulting in a worldwide loss of confidence in government.  People fought amongst themselves and countries were close to a civil war.  Many people died due to the civil unrest and the casualties were out of control.  The world was in a state of international emergency. ",

            "text": "You had to fight for yourself over those years.  Economies had fallen and unless you were self-sufficient, obtaining food was difficult.  People had relied so much on the old system that when the rug was pulled from under our feet, we didn't realise what had happened.  We were not prepared for those months.  They had brought the attack forward as the few of us who had awoken started to reveal the mechanics to this evil.  The algorithms inside the control room had told them that they had to attack us now.  People's stupidity and denial of truth kept the majority running in the gerbil room.  Most just fell into an even deeper sleep.  We had fully immersed ourselves into their narrative, digesting and living the script they had planned for a very long time.  So many just blindly followed, lost in a heavy suffocating all-encompassing darkness.  they created the money.  they created the problems.  they then created a solution that only limited us.  they used the excuse that the money isn't available to solve those problems.  so we ended up caught in a whirlwind of dramas that stifles our human evolution.  The creators of that money wanted control of our consciousness, and they would do everything to stop us.  No one was going to save us from this horror.  No leader could sufficiently lead us.  We were emerging slowly, but would we change in time?  We could only lead ourselves, but most people had been broken down by the constant abuse of control.  We had to come together and find ways to connect.  But most locked their houses and kept themselves barricaded in.  The ones that were trapped in the cycle of fear were the ones that perished.  When we stood strong, understanding our true power, this could not affect us.  Your life is your human sovereignty.  Each life is crucial.  Each life must be questioned.  When do you give your power away? ",

The creativity, everything that's put into it.  The man's absolutely fantastic and he's got heaps of these, mental health, property seizure, mask, agenda, the great reset.  And we know at this point in time, they're really trying to keep us away from one another.  They don't want us in communities.  They don't want us speaking our truth and telling the world what is really happening.  That's why they're trying to segregate us.  They're trying to kick us off platforms.  They're trying to quell our voices, especially on Twitter, on Facebook and all these big places.  So finding these creators, I definitely want to share them with you.  Please go over there, subscribe to his channel.  He has a video premiering in, I think, five, six hours from now called The Deep State, and that one's going to be, no doubt, amazing as well.  So share this on different platforms.  Like him, subscribe, and if... you guys like this sort of thing and me plugging these channels or when I find something like this, let me know and I'll keep doing it because there is a lot more people out there than you think that really sees this world for what it is and have really broken the illusion of it.  This is the speaker.  Stay ravenous. ",
