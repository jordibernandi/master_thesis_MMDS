            "text": "I'm looking at you, Georgia.  Hell, I thought my home state of Oklahoma had problems.  You guys just elected, or the majority of Georgia voters just elected, this woman to the 14th Congressional District, Marjorie Taylor Greene.  Now, if you haven't been tracking this little slice of heaven, imagine an unholy union between Alex Jones, Michelle Bachman, and the thickest tree stump in the forest, Marjorie Taylor Greene.  She is, go figure, a Republican.  She is a right wingnut.  waging a by-the-minute assault on reality.  Now, check out the stuff she believes, and literally check it out.  Don't take my word for it.  This woman actually believes the following.  She thinks that the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, which killed 20 children, was actually a false flag operation that was carried out by some shadow organization.  She suggested that the mass shooting in Las Vegas back in 2016 was staged by anti-gun activists.  Oh, look at the crowd, mostly conservatives.  This must have been an anti-gun plot.  Speaking of mass shootings, David Hogg.  Remember him?  He's one of the survivors.  At Parkland back in 2018 at Marjory Stoneman Douglas School, 17 people died.  He and other students and many other people came together as gun control advocates.  Marjorie Taylor Greene caught up with David Hogg at the Capitol.  Now, remember, this is the same woman who has called him little Hitler.  She's on video harassing a mass shooting survivor. ",

And he's a coward.  He can't say one word because he can't defend his stance. ",

            "text": "Now, just a quick digression.  George Soros, he's popular among the QAnon crowd.  He's been blamed for everything from gassing the Jews to being behind the deep state.  He is a billionaire and a Hungarian Jew who actually escaped the Holocaust back in the 1940s.  Marjorie Taylor Greene thinks he's a Nazi.  She's on record blogging back in 2016 about Pizzagate.  In this little conspiracy theory, it was claimed that Hillary Clinton and other Democrats were running a child sex trafficking operation out of the basement of a Washington pizza joint.  A pizza joint that has no basement.  Marjorie Taylor Greene said, yeah, this seems legit.  By the way, she also has claimed that Hillary Clinton took part in satanic ritual sacrifice and drank the blood of children.  And because we're on the subject of the Clintons, there's a longstanding conspiracy theory that Marjorie Taylor Greene buys into that the Clintons are actually assassins.  They have murdered dozens of their political enemies.  So whatever you do, don't piss off the Clintons.  They will have you whacked.  She said that no plane ever hit the Pentagon on 9-11.  She says that Barack Obama is a Muslim.  She says the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville was staged.  That Zionists are trying to wipe out white populations throughout Europe.  And that COVID-19 masks represent, in her words, democratic tyrannical control.  And now, my friends, it has come to light that Marjorie Taylor Greene wrote a Facebook post back in 2018 talking about the runaway California wildfires.  She believed the fires were deliberately set by a secret Jewish space laser.  Now, this little piece of anti-Semitism is actually linked to a longstanding conspiracy theory about a Jewish family of bankers, the Rothschild family.  And they're supposedly involved in all kinds of wicked Jewish deeds, part of the New World Order.  And Marjorie Taylor Greene declared that this secret Jewish space laser... was fired by PG&E, the gas and electric company, and PG&E had teamed up with the Rothschilds to clear room for a high-speed railway.  Now, lest you think this woman isn't batshit and awful enough, it has been discovered that that she has indicated support for the execution of prominent members of Congress.  Her political opponents, no doubt a bunch of freedom-hating, deep state, blood-drinking, baby-eating, sex-trafficking, false-flagging, space-laser-pointing Satanists.  This woman won the majority vote for the Georgia House of Representatives.  This was Georgia's pick.  By the way, now she wants to impeach President Joe Biden.  She wants to impeach him because reasons.  Somebody call somebody.  We are long overdue for the intervention, right?  And beyond all that, you've got this deafening silence by the whole of the Republican Party.  Are they more interested in power than sanity?  Or are they already so primed for conspiracy bat shittery that they have more in common with Marjorie Taylor Greene than they do the real world?  They've demonized people for so long, now they treat them like actual demons.  How alarmed is Marjorie Taylor Greene's party about her crazy and offensive ideas and behavior?  Here's how offended they are.  Republican Party leaders just appointed her to the House Education and Labor Committee.  This woman is influencing everything.  The GOP has not only jumped the shark, it's telling us the shark isn't really a shark.  It's actually a disguised group of blood-drinking satanic pedophiles who are transporting COVID tracking chips to Jews and Muslims who want to drop laser bombs from their orbiting Dr.  Evil space lab.  This is the 21st Century Republican Party.  This is an apocalypse cult, totally detached from reality, from science, reason, decency.  And as far as I'm concerned, the only thing more terrifying than George's Ku Klux Karen is the huge swath of Americans that has given people like her the keys to our halls of power.  She's a symptom of a much greater problem, and that problem is us. ",
