            "text": "I'll give you the story behind this wall.  You can see where the wall goes down into the sand here, but this is what's called the floating fence.  And this was constructed in 2008 after Border Patrol agent Louie Aguilar was run over and killed out here with a stolen Humvee full of dope that the Border Patrol was trying to pull over.  was evading apprehension and they were trying to make it back into Mexico because this didn't exist here before.  And they knew they could get away.  All they had to do was get past the border patrol.  So Louie Aguilar was out here in January, 2008, near where we started up there by the road and putting out spike strips to stop the vehicle that was already being pursued by the border patrol.  The person driving the vehicle saw that Louis Aguilar was there with the spike strips and intentionally drove towards Louis Aguilar and ran over him and killed him out here in January of 2008.  Shortly after that, this wall was funded and built and placed out here.  And this area, especially in the winter, gets tens of thousands of off-road visitors from California, and Arizona that come out here and converge on this place.  more than 10 000 people out here for the week of thanksgiving and so what would happen was the uh the smugglers from mexico would try to blend in with that off-road legitimate off-road traffic in the area here in the border patrol had to keep an eye really close to the line here just to see who was going back and forth into mexico.  now with this wall here we don't have to worry about this.  we haven't had any trouble out here since we've erected this floating barrier out here in 2008 and this is a 16 foot high barrier.  uh we have to uh the sand shift out here a lot so we have to continuously keep it cleaned out.  but it's this was engineered to be able to be these sections to be lifted up and and placed back on top of the sand and stay.

And they all go into Algodones and get a lot of this work done.  Well, just north of there is also a casino, the Indian casino.  So we've worked with the Kachan to erect a double wall system in that area, just between the US and Mexico, Algodones and Andrade.
