Now, we've heard from basically every other preacher out there.  We've heard them completely melt down over a Biden victory in the election.  But Pat Robertson hasn't really said a word about it up until now.  For those of you who are watching this, I just released a video on Sunday that contains Pat Robertson's predictions, but we didn't have the results yet of the election to see him meltdown.  But we didn't have his meltdown after the election yet.  So let's start by watching Pat Robertson's predictions, and then we'll watch his meltdown. ",

            "text": "Okay, wait a second.  Why is that without question?  Even when this video came out, which was, of course, before the election... We had no reason to think that Trump was going to win.  Now, people talk about how inaccurate the polls are all the time.  Let's talk about the polls.  Let's talk about the accuracy or inaccuracy of them.  Let me explain how polling works.  A lot of you guys probably already know this, but again, I'm going to go through this for those of you who may be unaware of how polling actually works because it was a complete mystery to me up until very recently.  So this is FiveThirtyEight.  It's a poll aggregate company.  This is a list of polls that were released on November 2nd, 2020, right?  And we can go through the whole list.  Each of these is a different polling company.  We've got YouGov, YouGov, ResearchCo, Ipsos, Swayable.  SurveyMonkey, we've got a bunch of different companies that are all doing these different polls.  And right here on the side, it has a sample size.  This YouGov poll has a B rating as a pollster.  And this poll, this specific one that they did, ran from October 31st to November 2nd.  And it sampled 1,363 people.  As you go down the list, you see similar information.  1,025 people from ResearchCo.  914 from Ipsos.  Why don't they just pull one great big swath of the country?  Say, why don't they pull 100,000 people in Michigan?  The reason is because... The more people you ask, the less accurate the poll gets.  There's something called the law of averages in statistics.  Say you're at a carnival and there's a guy with a giant ass jar of beans there.  It's got like 50,000 beans in it, right?  The guy says, if you can guess how many beans are in this, I'll give you $100,000.  If you go around to every single person in that area and ask for their guess... Say one person will tell you 500 beans.  One person will tell you 30,000.  One person will tell you a million.  One person says 600,000.  If you take all of those guesses and average them together, you will get... a rough estimate of what the number actually is.  You take the high estimates and the low estimates and average them together and it'll give you an accurate representation.  That is the idea behind poll aggregates.  We want to take polls that are rated really, really well and polls that are rated really, really poorly and average them together to get an average number.  Now, even when you do that, there's still a margin of error of about three points.  So on the last day that polls were submitted, Biden's lead was 8.4 points over Trump.  That means, with the margin of error, it could have been anywhere from 5.4 points to 11.4 points.  That's the nature of polling.  I have a YouTube channel and a studio that I can go to and look and find out exactly how many people subscribed one day, exactly how many people watched the video, how many monetized and demonetized views it has.  I have this information at my fingertips.  We don't have that with presidential elections.  That doesn't exist.  Polls are the best thing that we have.  The only thing that we have.  With that being said we need to find a way to make the polls work.  Companies invest millions, even billions of dollars into getting accurate information.  Not just companies, but Biden's campaign does polling.  Trump's campaign does polling.  Every political campaign has internal polling and they watch this information because they want to know where they need to focus their efforts.  Polling is the best we've got.  So were the polls accurate in 2016?  Yes, they were.  Polls in 2016 were accurate.  They were about 1.7 points off.  That's within the three-point margin of error.  That's pretty fucking good, all things considered.  And when you think about it, you can probably attribute that margin of error to different things.  Voter suppression and things like that.  The problem in 2016 was the fact that the pundits were convinced that Hillary was going to win.  When the polls did not reflect that optimism, there was a good chance of Hillary winning.  They ran statistical models that showed that Hillary won 73 out of every 100... simulated elections.  That means she had a 73% chance of winning.  But that doesn't mean a 0% chance of losing.  Trump still had a 27% chance of winning.  Just because Trump won does not mean the polls were inaccurate.  So what about 2020 polls?  Were they accurate?  Yes, they were.  They were fairly accurate.  They were off by within the margin of error in most areas.  In some areas, they were off by a lot.  They were off by six points, for example.  I think in Michigan and Wisconsin, they were off by a lot.  But by and large, generally speaking, the polls in 2020 were pretty accurate.  And as I said, they are all we've got.  Even if they suck, it is our only means of determining where efforts should be focused and who has a good chance of winning.  So with that being said, I'm really not sure what Pat Robertson is talking about here.  I don't understand why he thinks that Trump's victory was a foregone conclusion.  Let's keep watching. ",

It tells me he actually does know what socialism is, but that's not what any U.S.  leader has advocated for.  Bernie Sanders and AOC probably being the closest to socialism out of any U.S.  leaders, I would say.  Neither of them want to seize the means of production and supply.

Why would somebody try to fight making things more efficient?  He's like the guy in the early 1900s who was fighting the car in favor of the horse-drawn carriage.

Either humanity is going to die out because we live in an uninhabitable world, or he's going to start pulling it together and supporting climate change action.  Back in the 1960s, black people were literally drinking from colored water fountains.  They were using colored bathrooms.  That was only 60 years ago.  There are people alive today who had to use the colored bathroom.  Imagine that shit.  Just look how far society has moved in just 60 years.  We've progressed really far.  Not far enough.  Don't get me wrong.  Not far enough.  But we're on our way.  60 years can make a big difference.  As Pat's generation exits societal influence, climate change is going to become a bigger and bigger issue and more and more accepted.  Just like gay marriage.  The LGBT community, generally speaking, is pretty well accepted by most of the country, most of the world.  We have gay marriage now.  People aren't drinking from colored fucking water fountains anymore.  Progress happens.  The moral arc bends toward justice.  It's just a long, painful road, and we pay for every victory in blood. ",
