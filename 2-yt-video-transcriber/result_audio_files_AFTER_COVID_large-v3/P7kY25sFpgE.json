            "text": "Here we go.  I don't care.  Can I help you?  You can talk and you can stand right there.  Thank you.  I know I am.  Sorry, but that's not my problem.  You're out in public and you're public officials.  Is there anything else I can do for you?  I'm sorry?  Is there anything I can do for you?  Nothing.  We'll get off the property.  Thank you.  Whatever I can see.  Okay, we're not allowed to be in the parking lot of the dormitory taking pictures.  I wasn't in the parking lot.  Okay, you cannot be taking pictures.  I wasn't in the parking lot.  I was on the roadway.  It's a public easement, right?  Utility poles.  It is policy.  I don't care.  I don't care about your policy.  You don't care about policy.  I don't care about their policy.  I'm not behind those walls.  Okay.  Do you want to end up behind the walls?  I don't think I will.  Because you didn't... What?  Be careful.  Be careful.  Okay.  You said policy.  That is not law.  Okay.  Law says... I can take pictures.  Okay, but what's your purpose for doing so?  Whatever I want it for.  Whatever you want it for?  Yep.  Okay, well, that's the problem.  See, it's suspicious activity.  All right, that's why we're here talking to you.  Well, let me ask you a question.  Yeah.  Is suspicion a misdemeanor?  It's neither, but it gives us the right to be here and asking questions.  You can ask all you want.  It's an investigation, and if you're not going to cooperate... I don't have to cooperate with your investigation.  I am not lawfully and under no obligation to cooperate with you.  None.  Okay.  I'm just going to talk to you this way.  Am I being detained?  Am I being detained?  Am I being detained?  Technically, right now, you are being detained.  For what?  For what?  What crime?  Okay.  What crime?  This is the issue, okay?  You tell me what crime, and I will tell you.  You need to be quiet for just a second.  I am not going to be quiet.  I don't have to be quiet.  You don't understand what the word detained means.  Yes, I do.  Detained means you are not free to leave.  You are not free to leave.  For what crime?  For what crime?  You are not being detained for a crime.  Then I should be free to go.  Reasonable suspicion.  What is your rats?  What is your rats?  okay what is your?  what is your rags that have criminal activities at foot?  you are taking pictures?  is that illegal?  is that illegal?  you guys do you guys arrest the google car that comes down through here and takes pictures of all this.  i can see it on google maps.  that's because they use something.  no they drive right down through here but they don't take pictures.  yes they do.  that's how i found the place.  So what is your purpose for being out here?  None of your business.  Other than trying to get it on YouTube and be famous.  None of your business.  If that's what you think, then you're going to be famous.  Am I free to go?  Am I free to go?  You're not free to go yet.  Why not?  Because.  Because your butt hurt?  Your ego won't let me continue about my way?  It's got nothing to do with my ego, sir.  Then why?  This is legally, constitutionally protected activity.  First Amendment.  I'm a journalist gathering content for a story on the prison, on that prison, and the juvenile center.  Do you have any identifications?  I don't have to show you.  I don't have to show you.  If I ask you for ID, you do have to provide it.  No, I do not.  Yes, you do.  Not unless I'm legally arrested.  If I'm legally arrested.  You don't have to be committing a crime.  If I'm legally in the state of Indiana, I have no weapons.  I have a pocket knife.  That's it.  And that's all I have.  And that's fine.  Why don't you step it down a little bit and stop yelling?  I don't have to listen to you.  Do you understand what I'm saying?  I'm going to be free to go on my way.  Why not?  Unless you can tell me that I have broken the law for you to stop me, I'm going to leave.  You are not free to leave.  What other people?  For what?  Because you're an egomaniac?  You're a puss?  You're a puss?  You gotta call your little... I don't have to help you with that.  I do not have to cooperate with you at all.  One bit.  And you know you're wrong because you're shaking your head.  You know I'm right.  You are wrong.  And you're going to find... Where's your supervisor?  He's on his way.  Okay.  You'll be more than welcome to talk to him.  Your sergeant?  Lieutenant?  Sergeant.  He's on his way.  You're more than welcome to talk to him.  That's fine.  I'd like to be on my way.  Because I haven't broken any laws.  Be informed.  I'm perfectly okay with being on camera.  You've got about 600 people watching you right now.  That's perfectly fine.  So am I detained?  Lawfully?  You are being detained until this investigation is completed.  Lawfully detained?  Yes.  What is your razz that I am suspicious?  The fact that you're videoing the prison.  It is constitutionally protected activity for journalists, for citizens.  Then you need to provide identity.  I don't have to provide you anything, sir.  No, I don't.  This is why I'm having to raise my voice, because you won't stop trying to talk about me.  Because you're being dumb.  You're being dumb.  Your ego will not let you walk away.  If you think that the reason you're allowed to be videoing the prison is because you are a journalist.  I am a citizen journalist.  Then you need to provide some sort of proof that you are a journalist.  Who issues credentials?  Who issues credentials?  Every single news media outlet issues credentials.  No, they don't.  Corporate media.  CNN.  I didn't do that.  Listen, unfortunately, like I said, I'll do a GSI survey again and I'll come back.  If I'm right.  Do you have your ID and stuff?  I don't have to show you that.  Am I being detained?  What's that?  You have to ask me to leave, right?  They're asking me to leave.  We found out that this is their property.  I have to leave, right?  Right.  I'm just asking you.  I'm not showing you any ID.  Have a nice day.  I'll be out of here.  Well, when I come back here, sir, I will have proof that this is not state property.  And I will be allowed on here.  And if you call them again, you will be.  Thank you.  Thank you for clarifying it.  No, I'm leaving.  I'm not being criminally trespassed.  You guys are asking me to leave and I'm leaving.  So suck it up.  Thank you.  What do you got going on out here?  Just filming.  What are you filming?  Now your name and badge number, please.  Yeah, Sergeant Matt Voorhees, Indiana State Police.  Okay.  Badge number X-238.  Okay.  Just filming.  Not in public.  I'm just curious why?  your military personnel on base.  Just asking why.  What you're trying to capture out here.  Whatever I can see.  Okay.  All right.  Just going to get a picture of you.  No, thanks.  In case they have any more concerns about you.  Have I done anything wrong?  Pardon?  Have I done anything wrong?  Oh, no.  Then you don't need to take a picture of me.  All right.  Take a picture of me.  It's okay.  Are you a trooper?  Yes.  Okay.  Then you're a public servant.  Sergeant.  Then you're a public servant.  I can film you all I want, and I can film this all I want.  Okay.  Okay.  Have a good day.  All right.  Be careful.  Just don't go onto the base, all right?  You're not welcome on the base.  I'm well enough not to have directed from you, so just go on and go about your business.  Okay.  Sounds good.  All right.  Have a great day, sir.  You too.  Be safe.  Anything about this base?  I can report anything I can see from public.  I am not on that property, sir.  You are on.  Who are you?  By the way, what security force are you?  Frickus.  Okay.  Okay.  From where?  What security?  Okay.  So you have to leave and take whatever you're recording right now.  Yes.  No, sir.  Yes, you do.  I've already talked to the state trooper.  You guys saw me talk to the state trooper, right?  I was the state trooper that you just talked to.  No.  You stopped me earlier.  You're looking like a fool.  You know that?  Okay.  So take your butt back inside and leave the public alone.  I'm on public easement.  33 feet from the center line is public easement.  See those poles right there?  Their utility pool.  We'll just get Metro out here.  You can call whoever you damn well please, my friend.  You're going to look like a fool.  Not like you already have.  Thank you three for being professional, at least.  I know you three saw me talk to that state trooper, and he didn't have a care.  He just asked me the same thing.  Clearly it's none of your business.  I'm not on the base.  I can't hear you.  It's just you're recording the people and making everybody nervous.  That's all.  To actually surveillance of, and we don't know who you are.  Did you swear an oath to the Constitution or people's feelings?  So the question is, it's ultimately a safety issue.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Did you swear an oath to the Constitution of the United States?  Yes.  First Amendment, right.  This is protected activity.  First Amendment, freedom of the press.  Freedom of the press.  There is no under certain crap that you're going to skew to me.  Why are you so upset?  Because I've had five, six, seven... eight guys.  because when this happens outside of here people why are you doing this?  what do you mean?  get shot.  i'm in public outside of here.  individuals who go overseas and actually do this i know and they're fighting for my right to do this.  i am in public sir.  your property does not start until past those polls.  so who are you?  it's none of your business who i am.  i'm a member of the public.  okay i'm a member of the public.  you are.  you are correct.  you are.  then get away from me.  no It's my right to be here, too.  You're in your official capacity.  You're supposed to be on base, and this is public property.  Please go away.  I'm part of the public.  That's fine.  You're not part of the public.  You are in military gear.  You're right.  You are on public.  That's a security issue.  How is it security?  How is it a security threat?  I'm not on your base.  Outside reporting individuals as they come in and off post.  So?  So that's public.  That's fine.  It's kind of creepy, stalkerish, but we're going to wait for the authorities to get here.  I'm sorry.  It's creepy for you, big boy.  Give me a break.  All you guys are armed, and you come out here and run your mouth.  Providing security to the installation.  Security inside those gates.  Correct.  Where am I standing?  Is this your property?  It doesn't matter.  It's public property.  Is that a crime?  To be very suspicious, yes.  No, it's not.  It's up to you.  They can't detain me.  They cannot detain me.  Okay, then I'm free to go.  Then I'm free to go.  Goodbye.  I'm going to continue to do what I'm doing.  Sure I am.  Where's your supervisor?  Are you the supervisor?  Well, then you better get somebody hired.  Because I've already dealt with IMPD on recording in public.  What problem is this?  You're trying to elicit a response from us.  No, I'm not.  Everything was just fine.  I already talked to the state trooper, and he didn't have a problem.  What was his name?  I don't know.  Are we going to clarify?  Here's your options.  You can stand over there.  You're going to have a lawsuit if you do anything.  Because here, you're impeding traffic.  Here is their property.  You're in a... No, sir.  There has to be an easement for I can walk down through here or ride my bike.  Because there's no sidewalk.  That's right.  No six-foot easement.  Do you see a sidewalk?  But they do not own it.  Do you see a sidewalk?  They own the easement.  There has to be an easement.  There is a utility.  Take that up to the mayor's office.  There is no easement.  There is no sidewalk.  The purpose is... Are you... I don't want to talk to you.  Go away.  You're barking orders and I don't care about you.  You're barking up the wrong tree, buddy.  I could care less.  Oh, I'm sorry.  You should subscribe.  Maybe you'd learn something.  Maybe you should learn something.  Maybe you would learn something.  I don't know how you know, but you're an idiot.  I'm sorry that I'm sad, but I value your opinion.  Hey, sir, he took your recording off property.  He took your recording off property.  You've got to go.  Please and thank you.  Please.  I've got two of these.  What's going on, buddy?  We're just walking around doing the First Amendment.  Okay, but this is private property.  So if they don't want your property, you've got to leave.  Out there, you can do anything you want to do.  Is this paid for by the city?  No, this is private property here.  Who owns it?  Indigo.  Indigo has a board of governors.  So that makes it private.  So it's... But it's paid for by tax dollars.  They ask you to leave.  You're not getting the bus.  You're not riding the bus.  You've got to leave.  Okay?  That's good.  Thank you.  We appreciate it.  Sure.  Are you going back this way?  Sure.  No, I'm going this way.  Thanks.  They asked me to leave and I'm leaving.  You weren't nice down there.  I don't care how nice you are.  I'm on a public site.  There has to be an easement as well.  There has to be an easement.  You see these?  Did you put these up?  Did you put all this stuff up right here?  Is this yours?  Did you put this up?  There is an easement.  No, I'm going to walk on the public sidewalk.  If that is your property back there, no.  Whatever you say, I'm going to stay right along here.  And Tuffy McTufferson right there needs to shut his mouth.  What?  Yeah.  Who are you, by the way?  Are you an officer?  I don't have to.  I'm in the public.  Are you an officer?  Are you a public servant?  Then go shut your mouth.  If you work here, then you don't have any authority out here.  Yeah, I bet.  Go away.  I'm going to stand right out here where I'm at.  I'm working.  Don't bother me.  I am working.  You never heard of journalism?  What a journalist is?  What's going on right now?  It's not essential travel.  You know what?  A journalist is on the list, fool.  Okay?  A journalist is on the exception list.  So, again, keep your mouth shut. ",
