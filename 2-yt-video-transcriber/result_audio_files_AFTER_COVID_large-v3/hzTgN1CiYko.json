            "text": "Shalom, call the law you.  how about?  you know, it's shy by shimmer cock with gosh.  Double honors to the Apostles and the elders.  salutations to all my fellow laborers doing this work in truth and sincerity Risking their lives and their freedom to do so now more so than ever.  To the scattered elect that are scattered around the four corners of the earth to be like unto the speckled bird the Israelite foreigners and to the aqua that are listening and learning.  to you I say Shalom This is your brother Malcolm from the branch of the Great Millstone here in Chicago.  And it's going to talk about the elect, the upcoming war, and the people that are going to be saved from it.  And just watched a very good video from the brother, you know, the head of the Carolina camp, ICR.  And And I had mentioned in a couple videos back myself about this new hack, supposedly, that came from Russia and China.  And basically, they put it out there for the last couple years that China and Russia both have the ability to hack into our grids and cause power outages and stoppages of water and that whole sort of thing.  And the scripture backs it up because it tells you that pretty much in 2nd Acts 6 and 24 that we know there will be days without water.  And this is a video that's called The Coming War of China.  that's playing in the background, a true documentary channel.  And, you know, in this fair use act, I'm not using the sound.  I'm not profiting from this.  I'm not doing this for financial gain.  This is being used for educational and informational purposes only.  So that's the disclaimer.  But... There is going to be, it's prophesied, there is going to be a war with China, but not just with China.  Russia is actually going to be the main aggressor in it.  And China is going to join on to them, and so are a bunch of other countries, and so are American allies.  American allies are going to turn on them, all right?  Because it completely tells you in Daniels that through peace, that he would try and bring peace He would, you know, let me just get it instead of fumbling over it.  Let me just grab that real quick.  And the name of this video is probably going to be straight scripture, no chaser, right?  When we go to the book of Daniel, you know, Esau is definitely going to be broken without hand, without power.  And it's going to be the Lord that does that.  But he's going to use the other nations, you know, everything, all his resources to do it.  The angels, the other nations, and eventually the Israelites themselves, the elect.  But this is Daniel 8 and 25, and it reads for through his policy.  Also, he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand.  And he definitely has done that and is still doing it to this day.  All right.  And he shall magnify himself in his heart and his mind.  He have, uh, either my superiority, false pseudoscience, elevate themselves, evolution, all the lies to, to, to basically the lies that, uh, they cover up who they are.  All right.  Because, uh, if it was told who they really are, the world would be in rebellion against them already.  So that's why they fabricated science to, to, uh, hide who they were, you know?  And, uh, And there's been many, many simulations done on the war with China and Russia.  And in those simulations, America has lost every time.  All right.  That was a video about that on the YouTube just a couple of days ago.  All right.  Not that not that long ago.  All right.  So let's just finish the scripture.  It says he shall also stand up against the prince of princes.  And that's going to be his biggest mistake.  And it says, but he shall be broken without hand.  No prosperity.  He's going to be broken down to nothing.  They're literally going to go from riches to rags overnight.  That's what's about to happen.  All right.  So let's go to the book of Jeremiah.  All right.  This is Jeremiah, the 31st chapter.  And I'm going to start at verse 32 at 31.  And it says, and behold, the days come, see if you're how that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah.  The same covenant that's being made.  The second covenant with in the book of Hebrews in the eighth chapter of Hebrews.  That new covenant is basically this one that Jeremiah was speaking about.  All right.  It's still with the Israelites.  So all that all the people can make it and everybody can be a no.  That's that's not.  that's not scriptural.  That's a false doctrine of man.  All right.  But it says, yeah, with the house of Judah, then reading on, it says, not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, which my covenant they break.  Although I was in husband unto them, say of your house.  So we committed adultery.  All right.  And a sentence for adultery is death.  But the Lord loved us so much.  You know, he didn't completely wipe us out.  He punished us and brought us low and but he didn't completely destroy us because the punishment for adultery is death.  A woman that commits adultery against her husband, her just punishment is death.  And we committed adultery against the husbandry, which was our Lord, our power.  All right.  Verse 33, but this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel.  After those days, say if you how.  I will put my law in the inward parts and write them in their hearts and will be their power and they shall be my people.  And now we've come back into our heritage.  OK.  And they shall teach no more.  every man, his neighbor and every man, his his brother saying no more.  Yahuwah, for they shall know me from the least of them, from the least of them until the greatest of them, saith Yahuwah, for I will forgive their iniquity and I will remember their sin no more.  Thus saith Jehovah, which giveth the sun for a light by a day in the ordinance of the moon and the stars for a light by night, which divided the sea.  When the waves thereof roar, Jehovah of hosts is his name.  Okay?  So basically, the Lord let you know as long as the sun and the moon and the sky given a light by night and a light by day, we will still remain and be his people.  All right?  And then it says, if those ordinance depart from before me, say of Yahweh, then the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before me.  Thus say of Yahweh, if heaven above can be measured and the fountains of the earth searched out beneath, I will cast off all the seed of Israel and they shall For all they have done, say of your house.  So even all we have done, we have done.  The Lord still didn't cast us away.  And see, that's what he tried to do was take our place.  He's tried to measure the heavens.  That's what the whole space travel was about.  And he couldn't even measure the sea.  You know, he tried to do in this movie's journey to the center of the earth as if he could go.  All right.  They can't measure the seas.  You know, what was that?  There was some movie called.  Family classics, so many legions under the sea or whatever.  All right.  No, they can't even go.  You know, there's certain depths that they can't go to because the pressure is too hard.  It crushes everything.  All right.  So the Lord gave them an impossible task.  Matter of fact, if you go to the book of.  Of Sirach.  And chapter one verses.  Let me just start reading verse one and read down to verse three.  All wisdom coming from the Lord and it's with him forever.  Who can number the sands of the sea and the drops of the rain and the days of eternity?  All right.  Who can find the height of heaven and the breadth of the earth and the deep And wisdom.  See, so the Lord made sure that that he would never be able to find any of this.  He would never understand any of this.  And they don't.  All right.  They haven't a clue.  They haven't a clue.  So let's go to back to Jeremiah.  Thirty second chapter.  All right.  Because, like I said, in this in this upcoming world's war and in Jacob's trouble, you know, a lot of Israelites are going to die.  The heathen are going to die.  But the people are going to be saved out of it.  The Israelites.  All right.  And not in only the elect of Israel, because the two thirds are set and marked for death.  This is Ezekiel.  Not Ezekiel, but Jeremiah 32, starting in verse 40.  And it says, and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.  That I will not turn away from to do them good, but I will put my fear in their hearts and they shall not depart from me.  So we're going to be made perfect.  We're going to be changed and made perfect.  All right.  Yeah, I will rejoice over them to do them good.  And I will plant them in the land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul.  This is how you know that the people over in our land are not the people of the Lord.  All right.  Because they're not.  they're not perfect.  All right.  They're nowhere near perfect.  Hell, if they were perfect, they would have melanin.  They wouldn't be pale fleshed.  All right.  And they wouldn't have pink city and they wouldn't be on lockdown and be full of disease.  and the people and the uproars and the people and missiles flying back and forth and bullets and rocks back and forth with them in the Palestinians.  The scripture said that when we go back to Israel, the Israelites will dwell in safety alone.  See, they don't fit the prophecies.  All right.  Verse 42.  For thus saith Jehovah, like as I have brought all this great evil upon this people, so will I bring upon them all the good that I have promised.  All right.  So what's that good?  Us going back to the land of Israel and all the nations being given unto us for inheritance.  For we're going to own them all.  All right.  All right.  Because why?  Because our punishment is up.  As a matter of fact, real quick, while I'm thinking about it, let's go to Lamentations.  This is Lamentation 4th chapter.  I'm going to start at verse 5, just since I already went in on those imposters.  This is Lamentation 5 and 1.  It says, Remember, O Yehawah, what is come unto us?  Consider and behold our reproach.  What was our reproach?  We've been made low, called by bywords, niggas, spics, beaners, coons, You know, Hispanics and Negroes, natives, tantos, engines, savages.  We've been called all these different names, man.  All right.  Verse two, our inheritance has turned to strangers, our houses to aliens.  So now you got these Edomites claiming to be us.  All right.  I have been claiming to be us for a very long time and they are not.  All right.  They're not at all.  All right.  Um, Let's go back to Lamentations 4 and 21 because this is what's happening as this war begins to come into place.  This is Lamentations 4 and 21 and it reads, Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwelleth in the land of Uz.  The cup also shall pass through unto thee, and thou shalt be drunken, and thou shalt make thyself naked.  The punishment of thy iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of Zion.  He will no longer carry thee away into captivity.  He will visit thine iniquity, O daughter of Edom.  He will discover thy sins.  And that's exact.  So all the sins and wickedness that they have done, well, we get into the time and period where they're about to play for it.  All right.  And they're starting to pay now.  We're witnessing the downfall of Esau-Edom, all right?  This is Ezekiel 11 and 19.  And that downfall is going to come when it's fully, when this third world war kicks off, which is at hand because we're at the last prophecy, the microchip in World War III, all right?  And the skirmishes may start, but it won't be full-blown world war.  But once that microchip gets enforced, this is going to go down.  All right.  And I can see the drama and the problems is going to cause with the allies, which is going to lead up to it.  But this is a. Yeah, Ezekiel 11 and 19, and this is and I will give them one heart and I will put a new spirit within you and I would take the stony heart out of their flesh and I will give them a heart to give them a heart of flesh and they will walk in my statues and keep my ordinance and do them and they shall be my people and I will be their power.  But as for those whose heart walketh after the heart of their own detestable things and their abominations, I will recompense their way upon their own heads, saith Jehovah Power.  Who is that?  That's the two-thirds, man.  Those are the death-by-pain children.  And there's no way around that.  All right?  You that have loathed the law and instruction, and been wicked, you know, male and female and child.  There's gonna be, the Lord is no respect of persons, man.  This is 2 Ezra 9 and I'm gonna start at verse nine and it reads, then they shall be in pitiful case, which now have abused my ways and they that have cast them despitefully shall dwell in torment.  So the Lord is gonna make you dwell.  He's gonna make you suffer.  It's not going to be some quick death.  The Lord is going to send horrible punishments and death unto you.  They're building up.  I guess they're showing you all the World War II footage.  Working their way up to modern times.  With all these no hip, no breast, no butt, you know, Edomite women.  You know, the thick ones were not being pushed back then.  Skinny Minnie was... Was the, you know, glad that day is gone, boy.  All right.  But verse 10, for such as in their lifetime have received benefits and have not known me.  All right.  So all you well-to-do jigs, all you celebrities, live it up, man.  You know, live it up because you're about to have a horrible existence until you expire and then come back.  As an Israelite on the other side.  Basically, you nutsack Israelites.  You wicked two-thirds that are going to be the children of the elect.  And you're going to be brought back.  perfect.  And exactly that, nutsack Israelites.  Until your father shoots you out into one of his wives.  That's what it is.  You don't get to enjoy the kingdom the first trip.  There's no greater honor.  then to be that, which is what the men of the Lord are striving for, to make that first trip, man, to cross over, to get that new body and go over, you know, without going to the spirit world and coming back out of your daddy's nutsack, all right?  Verse 11, and they that have loathed my law while they yet had liberty And when a place of repentance was open unto them, understood not and despised it, the same must know it after death by pain.  By pain.  And as we're looking at this footage of the first and second world war, working your way up to the third world, the first and second world have passed.  And behold, the third come quickly.  Call her law.  You have a passion.  I was shy.  I was shy.  I was shy.  I was shy.  I was shy.  I was shy.  I was shy. ",
