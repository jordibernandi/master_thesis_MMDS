This we can get through though, okay.  So I am going to arrest you for drinking and driving right now, okay?  And then we'll do the paperwork and we'll offer you a breath test.  And if you haven't had that much to drink, you know how that goes, okay?  And then if you blow under, if you do blow and you blow under, we'll get you home tonight, okay?  We'll get you home regardless tonight, okay?  But I am going to have to arrest you for drinking and driving tonight, okay?  So let's do this.  Put your glasses on or in your pocket.  I'm going to be nice and handcuff you in front.  I have to handcuff you.  It's our policy for transport.  Do you have any other weapons on you or anything?  No.  Okay, so let's do that now.  We'll talk to your husband.  He's going to be mad as a badger.  What district are you with again? ",
