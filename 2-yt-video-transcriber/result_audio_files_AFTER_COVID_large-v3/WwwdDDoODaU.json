            "text": "Well, I first arrived at the Walmart's Corporation Sam's Club store, and I saw all the watches and jewelry gone.  And I'm thinking to myself, damn, is Mad Max now hoarding Seiko watches?  Well, lucky for me, I don't have a job, and I don't need a watch anymore.  So I kept on moseying back to the back.  where normally I'm disappointed that the shit has hit the fan and they're all out of toilet paper most of the time.  But not today.  Today was different.  Yes, today was much different.  The 18-wheeler semi-truck had just arrived, probably around 5.30  p.m.,  and I was there about 6  p.m.,  And there were two pallets of toilet paper available to any lucky jackpot winners.  Here I was.  My shit had finally arrived, and I was at the Port of Sam, waiting to board the ocean liner to nationalism.  All hail Donald Trump, for I have some paper to wipe my ass.  And after our illustrious leaders are done bailing out the post office and the airlines and the cruise lines and the hospitals and the longshoremen and the California public pension system and the Congress pension system and the senator's pension system, and the evil casinos in Las Vegas, and after they're done bailing out the Dow Jones corporations, and they're done bailing out Uber and Goober, let me see, let me see, did I miss anyone?  Oh yeah, and the Patel, Motel, Cartel, yes, they will definitely need some bailout money.  Well, after all that bailing out, I won't need any toilet paper at all.  No, I won't.  Since the dollar bill won't be worth a bucket of warm spit, I can just use it for toilet paper in the summer and then burn it in the fireplace for the winter.  that's quickly approaching.  So please, seek shelter quickly. ",
