            "text": "Class of 2020, congratulations!  Congratulations to the Class of 2020.  Our undergraduates, our medical school students, our master's students, and our doctoral students.  I hope you are celebrating with your friends and family today, and I hope you recognize what a huge accomplishment this is.  I'm sure you're feeling like this is the most bizarre set of circumstances because, well, because it is.  Now, that doesn't diminish the pride and joy that the entire Brown community has for your achievements.  You are truly extraordinary, and the entire Brown community is behind you.  You have worked so hard to accomplish this amazing feat.  throughout some extremely difficult times these last couple months.  Your resilience, your determination, you made it possible for us with your grit and spirit.  But I wanted to remind you that this ceremony, this graduation ceremony, is nothing more than a really nice formality.  It was really just designed to have you walk across the stage, grab a piece of paper, and give you a moment to let it all wash over you, all that you have accomplished, all the successes that you have completed.  But those are already done.  You have those forever.  You leave College Hill.  at a truly, truly historic time with historic challenges and historic commensurate opportunities.  Opportunities to be useful, to change the world.  Now more than ever, the world will need your fight, passion, and your willingness to challenge the status quo.  We need your ideas, we need your desire, we need your compassion.  Your intellect, your curiosity, your creativity, your passion, your human empathy.  The world desperately needs your compassion, conviction, and humor now more than ever.  The world is asking you to be something you never thought of.  And be it.  You can and you will.  You have all of the parts and all the preparation and all the talent and energy and drive to be successful.  Go forward and tackle these challenges with confidence and courage.  There are two types of people in this world.  Those that build sandcastles and those that smush them.  My best advice to you is be the builder, not the smusher.  Work hard, stay true to yourselves, love your friends, call your parents, keep the big picture in mind, and never give up.  But as far as present reality goes, remain oblivious.  It works.  I promise you, 30 years from now when you look back, all you'll remember are the good times.  Thank you for your contributions that you've made while you've been here at Brown and that have helped shape and strengthen this university.  Brown is a stronger institution and a better institution than it was before you came.  The university is judged based on the quality of the graduates that it produces.  So if Brown is to remain one of the world's great universities, we will turn on what you go on to accomplish and advancing civilization in the broadest sense, addressing the many challenges that the world faces today, and pursuing the boundless opportunities that it offers.  So as much as it stinks to not have this day and not have this ceremony, you have achieved nonetheless.  You have succeeded nonetheless.  Nothing can take away from the education you've earned, the relationships you've formed, and the experiences you had at Brown.  And please always remember, ever true to Brown.  I look forward to celebrating with you next year and formally welcoming you into the alumni community.  You now join the over 100,000 other alumni around the world as members of the Brown Alumni Association.  Brown will always be there rooting for you, and we all look forward to joyfully celebrating your achievements together back on campus next spring and to cheering even louder when you walk through the Van Wickle gates.  Stay safe and stay strong.  Congratulations, Class of 2020.  But we're very proud of all that you've accomplished.  Class of 2020, congratulations.  I want to wish you guys the very best of luck in the coming years and go Bears.  Good luck and keep in touch.  You've done an incredible job under extraordinary duress.  I salute you, I honor you, and I say congratulations.  We wish you health.  We wish you joy.  We wish you love and fulfillment and peace and the ability to always celebrate amidst whatever life hands you.  Congratulations.  Felicidades.  Mabrouk Mazal Tov.  We will celebrate together next spring, but in the meantime, stay safe and stay strong.  You are going to be fantastic.  I'm so excited for you.  Congratulations.  Thank you. ",
