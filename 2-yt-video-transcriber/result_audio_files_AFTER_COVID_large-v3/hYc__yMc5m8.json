We don't know what's in the stars.  I just know I'll always follow the light in your heart.  So I'm not worried about us.  And I'm never bad.  We know how the story ends.  We will never break.  We will never break.  Build on our foundation.  Strong enough to stay.  We will never break.  As the water rises.  And the mountains shake Our love will remain.  We will never.  No, no, never.  We will never.  No, no, never.  We will never.  No, no, never.  We will never.  No.  The world is dangerous.  Throw it all at us.  There's nothing we cannot take.  We will never break.  We will never break.  Build our foundation Strong enough to stay As the water rises And the mountains shake.  Our love will remain.  We will never.  No, no, never.  We will never.  No, no, never.  We will never.  No, never.  We will never.  No, we will never.  No, never.  We will never.  No, never.  All right. ",
