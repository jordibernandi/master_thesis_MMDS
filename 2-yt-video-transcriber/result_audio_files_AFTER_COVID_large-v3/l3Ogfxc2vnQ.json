We ain't gonna do nothing, bro.  One, two, three.  What?  Boom, right in the face.  Hit him again.  Boom, right in the face, man.  Damn, brother, that's a good-ass video, bruh.  That's a good-ass video, bruh.  You gonna make me a copy?  Y'all think it's all jokes, but y'all were handling me on the news tonight.  Hey, if you want to talk to me, talk to me.  You got all you guys in here thinking it's funny, thinking when I told them you're not going to hit them.  It ain't funny when you punch a motherfucker.  Let me tell you what happened.

Puts his knee on his fucking head.  Boom, hits him.  Boom, hits him.  Hands behind his fucking back.  Now they start worrying because they know people watching.  Yeah.  What's on camera?  I mean, obviously that guy's got it.  I mean, look.  He ain't even trying to fight back.  Over on his back.  Boom.  Watch.  Knee to his fucking head as that guy's hitting.  Boom.
