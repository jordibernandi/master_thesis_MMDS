            "text": "Shalom, I'm Messianic Rabbi Zef Porat, and welcome to a special outreach update from Jerusalem, Israel.  We're living in prophetic and exciting times.  There's never been a generation closer to the second coming of Jesus Yeshua than this generation.  We're not setting any dates, but we know that the time is near.  And the veil is being lifted, 2 Corinthians 3, verse 16.  We're seeing what's happening in the world right now with the coronavirus, with the panic.  As believers in Yeshua, in Jesus, we understand that the time is getting near.  We understand that this is an end time warning.  To turn to Messiah Yeshua, Jesus, before it's too late.  To call on Him as Lord and Savior.  Am I saying that we're not supposed to prepare?  We're not supposed to take care of our loved ones?  Absolutely we are.  But there needs to be a biblical balance.  We can't panic.  our faith and our trust is only in messiah yeshua god.  it's a wonderful opportunity to share the gospel with those that are panicking with those that see that yesterday everything was sunny and today everything is so dark.  an opportunity for us to bring them to the true god of abraham isaacs and jacob jesus yeshua.  it's heartbreaking to see what's happening all over the world But it's even more heartbreaking to see souls being lost for eternity.  2 Chronicles 7 14.  If my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven and I will forgive their sin and will heal their land.  The word for panic in Hebrew is the word panika.  And even in the schools in Israel, in the public schools in Israel, they teach that the word panika comes from the goddess Pan.  And that's where we get the word panic from.  So we can see that there's a demonic spirit behind panic.  And thus God does not want us to panic.  He wants us to seek his face.  So God says, humble yourself.  The enemy says, panic.  James, chapter 4, verse 10.  Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will exalt you.  In Caesarea Philippi, we see Yeshua, Jesus, talking to his disciples about this spiritual warfare place, the gates of Hades.  In Hebrew, Caesarea Philippi, Abanias.  Before we read Matthew chapter 16, we need to understand the place that Yeshua took his disciples.  In Caesarea Philippi, this is the place where on a cave on top was the goddess Pan, where she was worshipped.  And we said that the goddess Pan, that's where we get the word Panika from, panic.  So spiritually.  we can see the battle.  Let's have a look at Matthew chapter 16, verses 13 to 18.  When Jesus, Yeshua, came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, who do people say the Son of Man is?  They replied, Some say John the Baptist, others say Elijah, and still others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.  But what about you, he asked, who do you say I am?  Simon Peter answered, You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.  Jesus Yeshua replied, Blessed are you, Simon, son of Jonah, for this was not revealed to you by flesh and blood, but by my Father in heaven.  And verse 18, the famous passage, And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it.  There's so much we can take out of this, but I want to focus here on the gates of Hades.  Because what we are seeing right now in the world with this coronavirus panic is exactly what Yeshua Jesus said that we're going to overcome.  He takes his disciples to Caesarea Philippi.  And as I said, if you go to Israel and you see the place where Yeshua was, you see that you look on top, there's a cave up there.  And in that cave is the place where they worshiped the goddess Pan, where the word panic comes from.  And Yeshua right there tells Peter, And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it.  What Yeshua was saying was, greater is he in you than the one in the world.  It doesn't matter what's happening in the world.  Yes, we are to take wisdom.  Yes, we are to worry about our families.  But we are not to panic.  The word panic is not from God.  It's from a demonic spirit.  And the gates of Hades will not overcome it.  There is no room in the life of a godly man and a godly woman for panic.  Wisdom yes, panic no.  This week we had several outreaches all through Israel, preaching the gospel, as panic is accelerating to a new level here.  Since the making of this video, there have been more restrictions by the Israeli government about going in the streets, but we still have opportunities to meet people and preach the gospel.  Nothing is more powerful and more strong than the blood of the Lamb, Jesus Yeshua.  As the streets of Jerusalem are not so full now with people, there are still people walking around in panic.  As the team were praying, I noticed an Orthodox Jew walking around the Old City, nervous.  I approached him and asked him, If everything is okay.  I introduced myself.  He introduced himself as Shimon Levy.  Interesting.  His name is Shimon Simon.  Shimon Levy.  began to pour out his heart.  He asked me, Are you not nervous?  Are you not scared about the situation?  Don't you see what's going on?  I have seven kids at home.  I went out right now to get some groceries and to see if God will tell me what to do.  I don't know what to do.  I'm afraid to lose my family.  I turned to Shimon and asked him, What God are you seeking?  He said, The God of Israel.  I asked Shimon, do you trust the God of Israel?  He said, yes.  I asked him, then, why are you panicking?  He was puzzled by my question and held his head.  I asked him if he knew where the word panika, panic, comes from.  He said, we study that it comes from the goddess Pan.  I asked Shimon, do you believe in the goddess Pan?  He said, no.  I told you I believe in the God of Israel.  I told Shimon, well, you can see that panic comes from the goddess Pan.  If you panic, you're putting your faith in the wrong God.  Shimon began to stutter.  The power of the Holy Spirit was working.  I then turn the Bible to 2 Chronicles 7, verse 14.  If my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, I will forgive their sin, and I will heal their land.  I told Shimon, God doesn't want us to panic.  That's from a demonic spirit.  God wants us to humble ourselves, repent and call on his name.  You said you believe in the God of Israel, but do you know who the God of Israel is?  And do you know what it is?  And do you know what it means to turn from wicked ways?  It was supernatural.  Shimon could not answer.  He couldn't move.  It was time for the full gospel.  I turn the Bible to Tehillim Psalms, chapter 145, verse 18, and read, The Lord is near to all who call on him, to all who call on him in truth.  God is not searching for religion or ceremonies.  He's searching for truth.  He's searching for the heart.  If my people will humble themselves.  Panic.  Viruses, sicknesses are far from God.  God is not the author of evil, but God can allow it.  We live in a fallen world.  Proverbs 15, verse 29.  The Lord is far from the wicked, but he hears the prayer of the righteous.  Sickness and panic are a result of sin, are a result of a fallen world.  God wants to restore everything, and he has restored everything to those who call on his name, in spirit and in truth.  Do you want to be with the Lord forever?  Yes, said Shimon.  I turn the Bible to Isaiah 4, verse 2.  In that day, the branch of the Lord will be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the land will be the pride and glory of the survivors in Israel.  I asked Shimon, do you know who the branch is?  He said, no.  I turn the Bible to Isaiah 11, verse 1.  There shall come forth a shoot from the stump of Jesse.  and a branch from his root shall bear fruit.  Shimon asked me, who is this branch?  I turned the Bible to Jeremiah chapter 23, Micah 5.2, Isaiah 53, and many, many Bible passages and read together with Shimon.  After reading this, Shimon was in total shock.  He knew the truth.  The power of the Ruach HaKodesh, the Holy Spirit, was hovering over the panicked area of Jerusalem.  The gates of Hades cannot and will not prevail.  I told Shimon, the branch is Yeshua, Jesus, the Messiah, God.  who died on the tree on the cross for your sins.  He rose on the third day.  And by His blood, if you repent and believe, you have full redemption of sins, eternal life, and you can overcome every disease and every obstacle.  And we are not called to panic.  We are called to call on His name as Lord and Savior.  And this is the only hope we have in this world and for eternity.  shimon was shaken.  i gave him my contact information.  we pray for his salvation.  one thing is certain shimon and all those that heard the gospel in the midst of panic in israel will never be the same again and for this we give all the glory to Yeshua, Jesus.  We will not stop preaching the good news of Jesus, Yeshua until all Israel shall be saved and for Zion's sake we will not keep silent.  Isaiah 62 verse 1.  And we know that the word for salvation in Hebrew is Jesus, Yeshua.  So it reads like this, For Zion's sake, I will not keep silent.  For Jerusalem's sake, I will not remain quiet.  Till her vindication shines out like the dawn, her Yeshua like a blazing torch.  We have wisdom from the Holy Spirit, not panic.  Let's continue to stand together as the one new man, Ephesians 2.15, bring the gospel back to Jerusalem and go home.  Until next time, I'm Messianic Rabbi Zef Porat, sending you blessings from Yerushalayim, from Jerusalem, Israel, in the mighty name of the Branch, the King of Kings, the Lord of Lords, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, Jesus Yeshua, Amen, at the gates of Hades, will not prevail.
