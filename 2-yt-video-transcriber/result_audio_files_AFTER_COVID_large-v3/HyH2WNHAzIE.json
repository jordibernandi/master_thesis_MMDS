And so we wanted to make sure that we're all on the same page, that this can be open but this can't.  And it's not an unreasonable thing to ask under the health and safety, and we have a right to do that.  And so... We definitely wanted to make sure that we're all on the same page so that there's no issues once they opened up.  That's what we hope to do.  If we can't get that agreement ahead of time, we'll show up Friday morning and we'll go walk through, the fire chief and the health inspector and everybody else will walk through and look at what they've put in place.  Because everything there is interactive.  And anything that's interactive is supposed to be shut down.  So basically... There's no touch.  And the whole place is an interactive facility.
