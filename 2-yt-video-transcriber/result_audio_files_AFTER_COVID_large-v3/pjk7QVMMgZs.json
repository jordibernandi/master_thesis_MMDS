            "text": "Well, it's Halloween again.  And 2020 has been quite a doozy.  But in tradition, we decided to rent a haunted house and see who might try to kill us.  And we're starting early this year.  Eli, want to have the owners?  I would love to.  This year's going to be fun.  Team?  Hey, what's up guys?  Oh, hi.  Got some reactive armor for this year.  I like it.  Right?  What the... What's with that?  It's like a child's toy.  I don't know, just trying to hunt me, kill me.  Pull?  Shall we?  Oh, my God!  Oh, no!  Somebody help!  Somebody help me!  Help!  I'm naked and afraid!  Really?  That's the best line you could come up with?  Heather, I am in my OP!  You're gonna blow my cover!  Come on, demon bitch, this is how you draw him out!  Rude.  That was a phase.  A phase that lasted way too long.  I need you to, come on, get a little... Oh, my... You've got bigger titties than I do, fat pea!  Okay, fine.  Whatever.  Oh, my God!  Help me!  Uh-uh, yeah.  There he is.  That really, that worked?  Have you not seen any basic horror movies?  Whatever.  What are you going to do about it?  Are you going to sit there eating hot dogs or are you going to do something?  Rambo 3-1, you are cleared hot.  Oh, yeah!  Congress wanted to get rid of that thing?  Fuck!  They're coming!  Well, we wait.  Alright.  Trophy zombie.  Trophy zombie.  Trophy zombie.  Trophy zombie.  You want it?  You want it?  Let's double DMX.  High low?  I'll take low.  Alright.  Okay.  Three, two, one.  Hey!  What the hell?  You guys are stealing all my kills!  Crispy?  Relax.  I'm red gaming zombie camouflage.  What?  Oh, gotcha.  Should we just let him handle it?  Yeah, that's solid.  It's almost like a Walking Dead episode, except for a real American hero's in it.  Right?  Is that show still on?  I have no idea.  How many times can you just keep killing zombies?  Right, you're going to keep doing the same shit over and over year after year and expect people to watch it again and again.  This is some get out shit.  Hey!  What's up, Heather?  Come on in.  Come on.  Hey, hey, hey.  Easy, easy.  Hold on, hold on.  Heather, Heather, super important.  1991 Wild Turkey Stamps.  It's a super important piece of American conservation history, Heather.  There is an invisible man chasing me.  Oh, nice.  Hey, I have a thermal.  Hold on to that.  You're right.  Is he dead?  Yeah.  Super dead.  Oh, yeah.  Super dead.  This is a late 19th century duck decoy.  That is awesome.  All right.  Here, check this out.  Super dead.  So, good news is I shot that thing a bunch.  Bad news is a full metal jacket is not going to work.  Why not?  It's a werewolf, Heather.  Well, just use a silver bullet.  Like I have a silver bullet in my crotch.  I never did come without one.  Did you clean that?  Is that... Hell yeah, brother!  Woo!  Okay.  It's that type of year.  All right.  Aw, the little guy's all tuckered out, JT.  Let's let the angry man know.  Yeah, he's angry.  Whoo!  Texas Horseshot!  How are ya?  What are you doing?  Just interviewing some purgeys that were down there burning up some buildings, businesses, and hurting some innocent people, you know?  Strictly interviews, though.  Just a face-to-face chat.  You heard a lot of screams?  Saw noises?  Nope.  No loud noises in here.  I've been watching Jurassic Park on repeat.  It's a real fuckin' cool series, man.  You should check it out.  Okay, it's been great.  Have a good time, okay?  Talk soon.  Oh man, one more thing.  Dammit, Logan, let me do me!  Stop!  He's good, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Clear.  How's that side hoe game going?  What?  Eli, focus.  Dude, all dudes have side hoes.  No.  What?  Dude, Tinder?  You know, smashing some... Nobody goes on Tinder anymore.  Well, so you actually have, like, a really good relationship then.  It's fine.  Fine.  Who's Kelly in your phone?  Why are you going through my phone?  Now he doesn't know who Kelly is.  Typical guy.  So, like, when's the wedding?  Stop!  I knew it.  No balls.  Hey, babe.  I never asked you to marry me, but I did ask for a moment of alone with my friends to get my killing on.  Is that too much to ask for?  Kiss me.  Yeah.  Wait a minute.  I'm telling Logan.  No!  No!  No!  Would you like to play a game?  You've ingested a nerve toxin, and will be dead in 30 minutes.  The antidote lies before you, in one of these boxes.  Wait, these boxes?  Yes, the antidote lies in one of these bo- Wait, did you really just eat all those fucking boxes?  Calm down!  G-God damn it.  OOF ROCK, GIVE THEM ONE FOR CHESTI, SET FOR FIDELIS!  Scotchy Scotch Scotch.  Oh, hello there.  I would say that this year was quite a success.  Ronnie killed a ghost.  I think.  You know, Heather kissed Eli.  Jared got an Air Force kill.  And most importantly.  What are you doing?  Finish the video.  It's my birthday.  Anyway, it's a great Halloween.  And maybe we'll see you next year.  We'll see.  Bye. ",
