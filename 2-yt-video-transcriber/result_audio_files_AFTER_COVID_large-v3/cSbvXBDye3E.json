            "text": "My name is Bob Thomas.  I'm the CEO of Thor Equities.  We own Sunset Golf Village.  We own Pond Ridge Estates, the Galleria at the Glen, and several other buildings that don't have names.  They're by train stations.  During this challenging time, we hope you're getting some well-deserved rest and relaxation and using this time to reconnect with your family.  You deserve it.  we wanted to clear up some misconceptions.  first and foremost rent will be due on the first of every month as it has been since the time our lord jesus christ walked the earth and will be until he returns to us.  we understand that many families are making sacrifices right now.  you might be choosing between eating and keeping a roof over your head and to this we say maybe it's time to lose a little weight tighten the belt, and make those tough choices.  We're making tough choices here, too.  We've closed down all of our gyms and common areas.  And just last week, we had to put my wife, Kitty, into a preemptive coma because she was being hysterical.  We will be complying with a state law that mandates that there be no evictions in 90 days.  But on the 91st day, we will be marshalling the full resources of our considerable legal team and focusing them solely on you.  We will literally go to the ends of the earth to make it right.  Here at Thor Equities, you and your family's health and safety is paramount to us, which is why we'll be going through all of the tenants in our building and identifying people that work in high-risk professions and then removing them.  I bought my first building when I was 15 years old, and there were no pandemics back then.  You had to get tenants out the hard way by terrorizing them until they killed themselves.  At Thor Equities, many of our subsidiary companies have been asked to produce ventilators, and we've declined that request because we don't want to take away someone's incentive to breathe.  My brother worked at Cantor Fitzgerald, and we lost him in 9-11.  And as he was laying there in the rubble, he was still trading.  That's what this country's about.  And that's what you're about.  And that's what 4Equities is about.  So keep fighting because we're not going to make it easy for you.  We believe in you too much. ",
