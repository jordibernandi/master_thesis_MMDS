And his people tried to block me from, like, reaching into him, which I did.  You know, don't block me, for Christ's sake.  I said, Tom, you and I need to talk.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, no, no.  We need to talk.  I'm coming to D.C.  and we're going to talk.  Because you can't, you know, they took him away.  The DNC can't screw this up.  They have a moral responsibility to make sure that we remove Trump.  And I am starting to detect from some of these DNC types that it's actually more important that they save their old corrupt system full of hacks.  That's more important to them than getting rid of Trump.  Anybody who puts anything ahead of when Hillary says that she doesn't know if she can endorse the candidate, meaning Bernie, Then you've just told me something about yourself, and it's pretty rotten and pretty scary.  That it would actually be better to have Trump than Bernie.  That's exactly what she said.  She didn't say it in those words, but that's what Biden said when he said he didn't know if he could commit to endorsing Bernie.  And on and on and on.  And that's why another whole segment of the Democratic Party hack establishment is backing Bloomberg.  He's now their great white hope because Biden isn't doing so well.  They thought Pete maybe could be, but I don't think that's going to go very well.  Who knows? ",

There are more people that believe in the things that we believe in than what they believe in.  A lot more.  By tens of millions more.  So, what do we do with that?  How do we organize that?  Because it will not happen just with people sitting at home watching this or looking at your device or listening to this on the way to work or whatever.  It is time to make a stand and make it now.  Do not plan on making the stand in the summer.  It has to be made right now in February.  We have to go full tilt against what the DNC is doing about this. ",
