            "text": "Hey everybody, this is Deb with Truthfication Chronicles, and I have Joe Biden's talking points to share with you this time.  The link will be down below, just as always, and you know, you can read them for yourself.  I'm not going to read all of them because this is page one out of 20.  There are 20 pages in this, and pretty much you'll probably know what's going to be in it, but there are a few things I'd like to point out.  First of all, I love the way it says messaging for surrogates, you know, people who are not really Joe Biden, but are out there supporting Joe Biden.  And these are the talking points in Q&A.  And this came out on the 29th of January, and it is for the 4th, I believe, when the caucuses happen.  So here we go.  This is what it says.  this is the high level talking points.  2020 is the most critical election of our lifetimes and it starts here in iowa.  oh you know what.  i will agree with him that 2020 is the most critical election of our lifetimes because if donald trump doesn't get in then the swamp does not get drained and we go back to the same old same old corrupt politicians running the show.  So, four more years of Donald Trump will fundamentally alter our nation.  You know what?  I agree with him on that, too.  And it's going to be fundamentally alter our nation in a very good way.  So, of course, Joe Biden is a candidate who can defeat Donald Trump and move our country forward.  Poll after poll shows he's the most electable Democrat.  I mean, seriously, folks, if he's the most electable, they're in sad shape, very much so.  And then it goes on, you know, we all have good ideas, but we need to ask ourselves, which candidate is best prepared to actually get them done for working families?  And then here's, you know, some of the things that he did, and he's going to help rebuild the middle class, because Trump hasn't done that, right?  So here's all the things he's going to do.  Now the field pitch.  But we cannot do this without you.  So come out to caucus on Monday, February 3rd and bring everyone you know.  Sign a commit to caucus card so we can help remind you where to go.  Because like they can't remember on their own.  I wonder how many people for that Trump rally the other night had to be reminded where they had to go and everything.  So sign up to volunteer, and every minute you spend knocking doors, not knocking on doors, but knocking doors, making calls, telling your friends, neighbors, and colleagues why you're backing Joe will help to make history.  So please, join Joe's coalition.  and help us to build it bigger and stronger.  to beat Donald Trump.  Yeah, pretty much that's what they keep saying over and over.  But this is what I like.  They start out and they have questions and answers.  The tough Q&A.  Impeachment, Bernie and Bloomberg, Iowa expectations, electability, getting things done.  Well, you know, the impeachment.  Donald Trump has been impeached because he tried to blackmail a foreign country into lying about a political opponent.  I don't think that's what happened.  I'm pretty sure that's not what happened.  And, you know, even the charges don't even say this.  So that's what's funny about it.  And it has nothing to do with lying about a political opponent.  It has to do with getting to the bottom of the corruption on that.  Trump claims that because Hunter Biden was on the board of a Ukrainian gas company, the vice president's actions to have a notoriously corrupt prosecutor fired were corrupt.  Well, it's because the prosecutor was not notoriously corrupt and was instead investigating corruption in Burisma, which was the company that had Hunter Biden on its board.  Hmm.  And every fact checker has conclusively shot down that lie.  The Washington Post, the AP, the New York Times, CNN.  n b c news and politifact each named it one of the biggest lies of twenty nineteen.  now these are the people that make up news.  why would i ever listen to any of them or what they have to say about fact checking?  Numerous Trump administration, national security and foreign policy officials have testified under oath that Trump's lie is baseless.  Yeah, and these are like the never Trumpers, the people that think that they're supposed to be running the country and everything.  Biden successfully carried out U.S.  government policy in Ukraine, period.  Well, the funny thing is, I really think he probably was carrying out Obama's policy.  which is sad because it was a policy filled with corruption.  And then it says firing Shokin was top priority for the IMF, World Bank, and EU.  Gee, I bet it was because Shokin was starting to uncover the money laundering going on, and all of them are involved in it.  So of course they wanted him fired.  Why wouldn't they?  Now this one says Republican senators, including Senator Johnson... were in favor of firing Shokin at the time.  I don't know about that.  I would like to hear from Senator Johnson about that one or some clip where he said it, because I don't think he would be standing for, you know, against Shokin when Shokin was doing the work that he was supposed to do, which was uncovering corruption in Ukraine.  And remember, I did a video about Senator Johnson.  in a letter he wrote about the Ukraine situation.  He was a witness.  He was there when all this was going on, but they never called him.  They should have called him in to testify, but they didn't want that because they knew what he was going to say.  And so then this one.  And this week, Senators Ernst and Scott said the quiet part out loud.  This impeachment is totally political.  Well, duh!  But I'm not sure why you're saying it here, because it's the Democrats who made it totally political.  We didn't.  They did.  So how will it impact the caucuses?  We have an opportunity to ruin Trump's night on Monday.  Ugh, I mean serious.  Serious, folks.  And then they go through and try to give the reasons why they want witnesses.  And then Hunter testifying, the Senate should call witnesses who can speak to Trump's conduct with inside information to Trump's behavior.  Not one, not even Trump's own appointees who testified under oath before Congress has suggested that the vice president did anything but his job in carrying out U.S.  foreign policy in Ukraine.  Well, but they were all saying that it looked bad about Hunter Biden, and they all said that it was something that they had discussed, and it was something that they tried to talk to the vice president about.  Yep, they did.  But, of course, the Democrats didn't put that into the impeachment hearing.  This whole discussion was cooked up by Trump to divert attention from his own wrongdoing.  And then, would Vice President Biden or Hunter agree to this idea of a witness swap, testifying themselves in order to have John Bolton or other witnesses testify?  The reason why we wouldn't make that deal is because they're corrupt and they know it and they're trying to hide it.  Bottom line, this is a constitutional issue and we're not going to turn it into a farce into some kind of political theater.  I mean, how could you have watched what Schiff did and Nadler, especially there at the end where Nadler got up to speak at the end and Schiff's like, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry, and tried to stop him.  Oh, that was funny.  Oh, you had to laugh at that, right?  Anyway, political theater, yeah, that's Democrats all the way.  They're trying to do that.  This is projection.  They're trying to say that the Republicans were the ones doing it.  No, we weren't.  We want no part of that.  Donald Trump and Republicans are just trying to divert attention from the issue at hand.  The president indicted himself and coerced a foreign government to interfere in our elections.  No, no, no.  You know, they always blame us for things they're doing and they've already done.  So anyway, and so makes no sense that they would call him.  They'd call, you know, they should call the National Security Advisor, you know, Bolton.  And why would they call Joe or his son?  Makes no sense.  What reason would there be to call someone to testify who has no knowledge of whether Donald Trump did or didn't do the acts he's being charged with?  Because what he's being charged with is that he was without reason asking Ukraine to look into Biden.  Although Ukraine already had an investigation going on into the Bidens and the corruption going on during that time.  But of course, we didn't hear that, right?  Because we don't want anybody to know that part.  Nope, nope, nope.  And so, you know, this whole document is pretty much like this.  I'm not going to go through the whole thing, of course, because it just, you read it and you're like, really?  Seriously?  I think we all know what's going on here.  And Joe isn't going to play that game.  It's the Senate's job now to try the president.  Our job is to beat him.  And then it goes through and you know the whole thing it talks about.  why was he negative at Bernie when he said he was Wasn't going to be negative against them.  So in other words, why were you lying Joe?  Why did you say one thing and then you did something else?  And then of course Social Security's because there's this video and transcript going out that makes Joe look like he's agreeing with Paul Ryan on Social Security and you know, they just are twisting things around and And, of course, he's got to go after Mayor Bloomberg and, you know, the expectations.  Joe's campaign is competing to win in Iowa.  Well, duh.  I mean, really, seriously, they had to put that in as a talking point?  Are their people that stupid?  No, we're just here in Iowa because we want to lose.  And so it goes on and it's like they want a candidate who represents our values.  Yeah, that's not Joe.  That's not hands-on Joe, right?  So much is at stake in this election, the very character of our country.  With Donald Trump at the wheel, it's no time to mess around.  There are a lot of principled candidates running.  Really?  Like who?  Donald Trump's the only one that's principled in that group.  They have some good ideas.  But this isn't a contest for who has a nice plan.  It's about who can actually deliver concrete progress.  And that comes down to three things.  Who can beat Trump?  Who will help the most other Democrats win the most seats?  Who will bring people together to pass actual legislation to help hardworking families?  And to every one of those questions, the answer is Joe Biden.  Joe is the one who can do it.  And we're going to have to win those key swing states we barely lost in 2016.  And Joe is the one who excites both our party's diverse base and independents and moderates.  Well, you know, the moderates are walking away.  The independents are not voting for Joe.  In fact, they are not really voting for any of the Democrats right now.  Oh, I like this one.  I know because I know Joe Biden.  You do too.  You've known him for years.  Yes, yes, I do.  And I've seen him sniff a lot of little children and touch women inappropriately.  So yeah, I know him.  That's why I don't want him there.  I also know what he's been doing in Ukraine and in China.  And yeah, Joe is made for this moment to bring us together, heal the divide and restore the soul of our nation.  Oh, isn't that nice?  And it talks about all the things he ain't done.  Okay, I'm going to skip down here to... Yeah, I know you hate it when I do that, but sorry.  Sorry, guys.  Okay, it talks about Medicare.  But this last part, Commander-in-Chief.  I mean, there's several other points in there.  I could probably read through the whole thing, but... Why waste your time, right?  So here we have it.  Commander in Chief.  Our next president will face a monumental task.  Repairing the damage Trump has done.  Restoring America's place in the world.  Yeah, got to get back to being under the thumb of the globalists, don't we?  Yeah, what are we doing?  trying to stand on our own?  Bad America.  there's no time to learn on the job.  we'll have to hit the ground running.  joe has done it before ready on day one knows nearly every world leader yeah and has done backroom deals with them and is part of the corruption that's going on and needs to be purged out of the entire world.  And a dozen years as chairman or ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.  Guess what?  That's the committee that likes to get a lot of kickbacks from all that foreign aid that we've been sending over there.  They're the ones that get money in their pockets from it.  So yeah, Joe had a dozen years as the chair or ranking member of that.  And so then it goes on and pushing key arms control deals.  Right.  And so he's going to reset our democracy.  He's going to equip the American people to succeed and renew American leadership.  That's what Joe is going to do.  And by the way, if you go through, there are places, it's one place where he's talking about the farmers, because the farmers know about climate change.  No, the farmers know that the weather comes and goes.  And it's been doing that since farming has started.  It happens like that.  Some years are good, some years are bad.  Sometimes it rains too much, sometimes it doesn't.  That's part of being a farmer.  I live in a rural community.  Believe me, I've known a lot of farmers.  I know a lot of farmers right now.  And my dad and his two brothers farmed about a thousand acres for a long time.  So I got to tell you folks, I really do know a little bit about farming.  The people around here, are not looking at climate change.  And they laugh at it because it's like, well, just wait around, the weather will change.  That's how it works.  And, you know, they don't believe in it.  And he's, you know, this goes off and it says, well, those Iowa farmers, they know, and they know that, that Joe's going to take care of them.  I was like, yeah, no, Joe, I don't think so.  So there's a pack of lies in between what I read you.  20 pages pretty much of lies.  And if you go through, it's just funny every time they're talking about Trump and the things that they're claiming that they want to do, that Trump has not provided jobs.  I thought that one was really funny because, you know, the Obama administration did a much better job with the jobs, like the shovel ready ones that weren't shovel ready.  So anyway, the whole thing, it's almost laughable.  But the problem is.  that the people who are following Joe Biden, a lot of them actually believe these things to be true.  And that's a little scary, really.  But that's the way it works.  And, you know, we need to be prepared.  These are probably a good set of talking points to go through and to prepare answers for, because if you know anyone who is a liberal, chances are these are the things they'll bring up to you.  And so if you have answers to address them, you've got it all set there.  You say, well, these are the talking points that he put out, but I can tell you that I can refute these with actual facts.  You know, I don't want to destroy your bubble, but yes, I do.  So anyway, that's what I've got for you.  The link will be down below.  You can read the whole thing if you want to.  You might want to get like some stomach medicine before you do.  I don't know.  I kind of went between laughing at it and just getting a little bit ticked off.  It's like, no, what?  You can't believe you're saying that.  So I don't know.  But anyway, that's it for this one.  I want to thank you for stopping by and I'll see y'all later. ",
