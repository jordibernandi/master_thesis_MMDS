I'm going to do my broadcast today.  What should we discuss?  Instagram.  I keep saying Instagram.  Twitter has stories now.  You can do stories just like on Instagram.  Instagram.

Yeah, I heard about that Lil Wayne.  They got Lil Wayne.  They gave him some fair charges on having a gun.  What's up, my Floridians?  Um, yeah, this election is funny style, man.  We got to be prepared.  Speaking of Florida, man, you know, um, some race soldiers killed two brothers down there, two, um, black teenagers down there, and they didn't even contact the family and tell them why.  And they already got Benjamin Crump on the case.  So the settlement deal is probably in the works, but look, we gotta, we gotta prioritize, um, you know, focusing on these race soldiers, man.  That's our biggest priority.  Don't let anybody get your eye off the ball.  Student loan, man, that's student loan cancellation bullshit.  This is what I'm talking about.  They're out here talking about some student loan cancellation is racial justice.  Man, these people are running a game on us, dude.  We have to call these folks out.  I'm going to go in on the CBC, the Congressional Black Caucus.  We have to look at them as the enemy of black society.  What's up to my army vets, my black army vets?

Most of we ain't no damn students.  All of us are not damn students.  That's not racial justice.  We ask for specific things, reparations for foundational Black Americans.  We're talking about some real tangibles, not a lift-all program that continues to have a wealth gap.  We have a wealth gap, and that's the problem.  Because we have a wealth gap, people are able to inflict harm on us Because they have the economics to do so and we don't.  There has to be a correction of the wealth gap.  Lifting everybody up is a con game.  Don't ever fall for that con game.  Do not ever fall for that con game.  Shout out to South Africa.  What's up in South Africa?  Man.
