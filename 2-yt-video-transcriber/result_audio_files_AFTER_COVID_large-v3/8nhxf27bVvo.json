Titus chapter 1 verse 10. for there are many unruly and vain talkers.  you know what it means to be vain sister.  vain is just like it means nothing.  it's meaningless.  go ahead They're deceivers, especially they have the circumcision.  Because the Christian church for the past 400 years has lied to our people, has deceived our people.  Give me John 8 and 44.  Here's why.  Here's the scripture I want.  Give me Syrac 34 and 4.  Here's what I should have went.  Syrac 34 and 4.  Here's the number one reason why we cannot unite in the Christian church.  Keep holding this.  Make sure we get this sign.  I want everybody to see this sign.  Syrac 34 and 4.  Sirach 34, verse 4.  Of an unclean thing, what can be cleansed?  Of an unclean thing, what can be cleansed?  What can be cleansed from something that's already unclean?  Go ahead.  And from that thing which is false.  And from that thing which is false or a lie, what truth can come?  What truth can come from it?  The Christian church is deeply rooted in paganism, rape, robbery, and murder of God's chosen people, a black man.  It's rooted in a lie.  So when something's rooted in a lie, you don't try to build upon a lie.  You destroy it.  You take it down from the roots.  So the Christian church is a system that has been used to oppress our people.  And one of the various ways that it's been used to oppress our people is by having this sign up here.  It's this sign right here that says God is a white man and his son is a white man is a lie.  And that's what the Christian church has been telling our people for 400 years.  that's why we can't unite in the christian church because we can't unite in lies and like the bible just said of something that is false what truth can come from it?  there's no truth that can come from something that is false.  didn't christ say you shall know them you shall know a tree by its fruit.  a corrupt tree cannot bring forth good fruit and a good fruit.  a good tree cannot bring forth bad fruit and the christian church has brought forth nothing but bad fruit.  now since a christian church we got crippled dollars church right up the street don't we?  Now, Creflo Dollar wanted $60 million to buy himself a private jet.  That's why we can't unite in the Christian church, because they're robbing of people who already don't have anything.  We can't unite in a place that the leader would steal from a people who already don't have anything.  That would steal from College Park.  You know, he makes 233 times more than the average citizen of College Park.  Creflo Dollar does.  But he's got the nerve to go up on that pulpit and tell those people that are taking the bus to his church, that are paying his tithes, that are paying tithes and they probably don't have any lights on in their house, paying their last dollar to this man because they're being lied to.  So we can't unite in lies, sister.  That's what the point is.  You got something? ",
