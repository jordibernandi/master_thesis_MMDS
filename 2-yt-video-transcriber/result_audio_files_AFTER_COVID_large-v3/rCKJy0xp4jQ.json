            "text": "I'll tell you my name if you tell me your name.  That's not how it works.  You addressed me.  You're a member of the Fort Lauderdale Police Department.  Your policy is to identify yourself when you come in contact with a member of the public.  What's your name and your badge number?  I just thought I'd ask your name first.  My name's Officer Segal, 1728.  Thank you.  Yep.  What we're going to ask of you, you're allowed to film, but we need you on the opposite side of the car.  No, sir.  No, you don't.  Yeah, we do.  No, I'm on the public sidewalk.  You have no authority over me.  Get back in your car.  You're dismissed.  Leave me alone.  That's not the way it works.  That's the way it's going to work today.  And you're also on camera, too.  It's going to work today like that.  I'm on the public sidewalk conducting a First Amendment activity.  Not on the sidewalk.  Yeah, this is a public sidewalk, sir.  Well, what are you going to do about it if I don't go across the street?  You're going to be warned of trespassing and you're going to be arrested.  Well, I'll be patient with you.  No need to be patient because I'm not going across the street.  Well, I'm going to continue and I'm going to ask for your name.  And you're not going to get it.  You're not going to get it.  Okay.  Well, Big Nick South Florida Accountability.  What?  Big Nick South Florida Accountability.  You told me.  Huh?  Yeah.  I think so, yeah.  Huh?  Is it this sidewalk or that sidewalk?  It's either sidewalk, Siegel.  It's either sidewalk that I pay for.  It's either sidewalk in public, sir.  Either one, sir.  Either sidewalk that I pay for, Siegel.  Hey, Siegel, I can even come up here, Siegel.  Look, I can even be right here, Siegel.  I can even be right here, Siegel.  Look, I can even come over here.  I can even come over here, Siegel.  I can even come right here, Siegel.  Yeah, I can, Siegel.  I can.  This is city property.  I can.  There's utilities.  I can.  This is public property, Siegel.  This is public property, sir.  Do not make up your own laws.  Do not make up your own rules, Siegel.  Yeah, this is public property.  Yeah, it is.  It is.  It is, Siegel, and that's not a damn thing you can do about it.  Ah, you can get all the cars you want, Siegel.  That's not a damn thing you can do about it.  You're dismissed.  That's called a walk of shame, what you're doing right there.  You are dismissed.  Do not come back and aggravate me again while I'm doing the story, okay?  Can you keep a secret?  Can you keep a secret?  Me too.  You're dismissed, Siegel.  Go try to intimidate somebody else.  It don't work here.  You didn't address me, so I won't identify you.  Thank you for your professionalism.  That's Carla Walker saying.  Big Nick South Florida accountability.  once again, guys came down to the scene of the original crime committed by the Fort Lauderdale Police Department.  So my mission of stopping the corruption here is not over.  It's just beginning until we change their behaviors.  I just had to put Officer Siegel in his place.  And I'm quite sure there's many more to come.  Big Nick South Florida accountability.  Out.  7-0.  You're gonna be my YouTube star, remember that?  Because all you have to do is just shut your mouth and let me do what I do.  Big Nick.  Big Nick?  You don't look so big, bro.  Keep watching.  I'm a lot bigger than your little ass. ",
