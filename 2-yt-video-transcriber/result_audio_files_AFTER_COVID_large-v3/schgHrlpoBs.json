So it's the emptiest I've ever seen it in my 16 years I've lived here.  So I'm pretty stoked.  I'm gonna just do some aerial shots.  I'm out here at the Hilton Lagoon.  You can see that from here.  He's going to do a run all the way down towards Diamond Head and then circle back around and fly back over.  So it's going to be a pretty long drone take.  And they're just using it as B-roll for their prayer breakfast.  that's going to go be tomorrow.  So it's all going to be live and just they're going to use some of my drone shots.  I'm pretty stoked.  So I'd be happy with any kind of work I get right now since pretty much my schedule has been wiped clean.  But I'll stop talking and check out the aerials. ",
