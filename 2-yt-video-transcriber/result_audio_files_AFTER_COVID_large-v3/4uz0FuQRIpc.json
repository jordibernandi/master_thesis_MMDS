            "text": "Hello everyone Apologies first and foremost for the audio quality.  something is wrong with my mic and I do not know how to fix it So there might be some static in the background.  Um, everybody has been, you know, asking, a lot of people have been asking, wondering where I am.  And, um, I'm just going to not pussyfoot around and explain to you guys exactly what's going on.  So, uh, right now I just want to start off by saying that I am more than happy to offer, you know, because I have not produced a book to offer a full refund to anybody who donated to me either through PayPal or Patreon, um, Those are the only two sources where I took donations for the book.  I still plan to complete the book, but just on my time.  And I want to give what is owed because I haven't produced what I've said that I would.  And then I'm free to produce it the way I want to, whenever I want to, and take as long as I possibly need to and want to.  and I do not want to be the person who promised something and didn't give it and deliver it without giving a refund.  I just don't want to be that person.  With respect to my absence, I will give only as much information as I think that is needed.  So I had some pretty severe health issues within the last year.  and I'm not going to discuss exactly what those health issues were.  If there's any kind of dispute about what I'm talking about, I'm more than willing to talk to somebody, for example, like Coltane, somebody who I trust, who I developed a relationship with for years outside of the MGTOW community.  And I could provide, you know, records to show you, you know, I was.  I was hospitalized for a period of about a month and a half.  And, you know, I've been in a pretty bad situation health wise.  And I'm just I've just started to get better.  And I was able to work again.  I was able to.  Um, um, actually do start, start hiking and stuff, uh, things along those lines.  Uh, and that kind of, you know, helped me turn my health around.  Um, and, um, so I was in, I was in a pretty bad situation that I've, you know, luckily been able to kind of pull myself out of.  And so I want to make it clear that, you know, that was part of the reason for my absence.  Obviously, you know, I couldn't really do much, but I'm not going to go into any more detail than that with regard with respect to my health.  Because, again, you know, unfortunately, I've learned the hard way that, you know, a lot of times on the Internet, people can use, you know, information that you give out against you.  So yeah, first and foremost, I want to apologize to the people who I've disappointed because I feel that's the right thing to do.  I wasn't able to produce the product that you guys, you know, that I promised you guys.  And for that, you know, I apologize.  I'm sorry.  And I want to make it right.  And I want to offer a refund.  Given that, I do want to also just make it clear that I feel that in the time that I had these health issues and things along those lines, I've kind of discovered something new about MGTOW philosophy.  I haven't renounced MGTOW philosophy.  I'm still telling you guys don't get married.  et cetera, et cetera.  I've cooled down a lot in terms of my rhetoric over the past, you know, 10, 15 years or whatever it's been, you know, it hasn't been 10, 15 years.  It's been like five, six years since I started.  But I say 10, 15 years because my MGTOW philosophy that I thought, you know, thought up and shared with you guys on this channel was something that had been brewing for at least a decade before I, you know, started kind of, I mean, it was a process.  By the time I got to making videos on my channel, it was, I was already in that evolution, but it had taken maybe six, seven, eight, nine, ten years in order to start that process.  But I have found in this time that I've taken off, I was able to start hiking.  I climbed Mount Katahdin on the Appalachian Trail, the northern terminus of the Appalachian Trail.  Possibly the first MGTOW to ever do that.  I don't know.  Maybe somebody has in the comments section.  But, you know, I have found in doing that, that was kind of a revelatory experience for me, that... I want to disconnect from this online world because I don't think that it's healthy.  And again, I'm not telling anybody not to engage in the online world or anything like that.  I'm not telling anybody to do anything.  I'm saying that for me, it's just not healthy.  I don't like it.  I don't like the way it made me feel.  And I'm proud of what I did.  And I'm proud of the videos that I made.  And I'm proud of the fact that still to this day, men message me and tell me, hey, you saved me from getting a divorce because I never got married in the first place.  Hey, you saved my life.  I was considering suicide.  I'm proud of that.  I'm proud of doing that.  I'm ashamed of the fact that I promised you guys something and didn't deliver it.  But again, I just want to make it right.  But I do feel that I need to, I want to leave, you know, the toxic online community.  i'm not just talking i'm not talking about mgtap i'm talking about the online communities in general.  i want to divorce myself from that because i feel like frankly and i know it sounds cliche i feel like it sucks the life out of you.  um you know and this is something that again i learned from by disconnecting from that from that realm from that arena.  and um you know i just want you guys to take into consideration that.  You know, if you put any stock or value into the things that I've said about Midtown going your own way and really forging your own path, consider, consider, you know, and again, if this is not right for you, don't do it.  Do whatever you want, but consider leaving, you know, these arenas and start living life in the real world, dealing with real people face to face.  You know, I want to disconnect from society, but I want to take valued people along with me.  Um, I, I have realized that I, you know, over the years, uh, you know, or, or this last year, I'm sorry, uh, that I, that I have developed a love, uh, for the, for the natural world.  And that's where I want to go.  You know, I don't want to be involved in all of society's machinations.  I don't want to be, I don't want to do that.  Um, because, because it kills my soul, you know, um, And, you know, uh, and I find that, you know, throughout this journey, throughout this MGTOW journey, um, I met some really cool people, you know, of all racial backgrounds and all that.  So I, I, I'm not saying anything, you know, bad about any, any racial group or anything like that.  But, you know, um, as, as an Afro Latino MGTOW, a black, a black man, essentially, um, you know, I went and did a 2023 and me and yeah, I'm, I'm black, you know, like, um, You know, I started to get very, very uncomfortable and a lot of other, you know, black and brown MGTOW in private have expressed similar thoughts to me.  I started getting very uncomfortable with these people who are talking about ethnostates and how they don't want people like me in this country and blah, blah, blah, and things of that nature.  And, you know, that was another thing, despite my health, that, you know, I really was just like, look, you know, I can't I can't really continue to associate with people who are espousing that type of rhetoric.  And unfortunately, there was some.  there was a bit of creep in within MGTOW, like those two communities started to overlap a little bit too much for my for my comfort.  But that's not an excuse.  I'm not saying that.  that's the reason why I haven't given you the product that I promised you guys.  There's no excuse for that.  And the only thing that I can do in terms of that is apologize and make it right and rectify the situation.  But however, you know, this is a message that I felt that I feel needs to be said to black and brown MGTOW.  You know, really ask yourself, you know, if these people if you're comfortable being around these people, if you are, that's fine.  Do your thing.  You know, I'm not telling you how to think.  I'm not telling you, you know, and I'm sure plenty of people are going to call me a cock or a W or whatever you want to call it.  But, you know, hey, I'm just asking you, man, like, are you guys comfortable with that?  Because I am not.  You know, so I am going to make a concerted effort when I do see that to distance myself from it.  I don't want to be involved in it.  I don't want to be, you know, and again, I'm sure there's, you know, somewhere, somehow I interacted with some of these people in the past because, again, there was an influx of those type of people coming within MGTOW, but I don't want to do it anymore.  And that's frankly all I really have to say on the racial issue.  I felt like that needed to be said.  And again, I'm sure I'm going to catch lots of flack and I'm sure I'm going to catch lots of flack for this video.  But what I do want to do, I don't really care about the flack.  What I do want to do is make things right for the people who supported me and did not get what I promised them.  So.  You know, that's all that I really have to say.  So, again, to reiterate, I don't want I don't want people, you know, because I don't want people asking and speculating and not knowing what's going on.  This is what's going on.  So to reiterate.  Um, uh, my absence, my absence, I, I got, you know, very, very sick.  Um, and you know, and, and, and that, that happened and that was unfortunate, but, um, my health has stabilized now and, and, you know, that's, that's, that's what happened.  So I want to get, uh, let you guys know that, um, And in terms of the book, I want to make sure that it's understood that I want to rectify this and I want to make it right.  So what I want to do is to anybody who donated, you know, if you so long as you provide me proof, because, again, I don't want to give money to somebody that didn't pay for the book.  Like, you know, so I you know, I mean, I just want to make sure that the money that people donated gets back to them.  Um, to the right people, not somebody, you know, just looking for a, uh, like, you know, to, to like, you know, say that they donated and they didn't.  Um, so as long as you can furnish some kind of proof on PayPal or, or Patreon, I'm more than happy to give you a full 100% refund.  Okay.  And, and, you know, these last couple of months I've just been working overtime because I wanted to, I just want to pay this back.  I don't want to owe MGTOW anything.  Um, I don't want MGTOW saying that I betrayed them.  You know, and I'm sure some people feel that way, and I'm sorry about that, but, you know, I want to, for the people with which I can make things right, I want to do that.  So... I think that's all that I really want to say right now.  I'm going to post another video in a week's time to give you guys an update of what's happening.  I'm not going anywhere.  As long as I'm breathing, I'm going to do that.  It's on my calendar.  And again, you know, look, if any of you guys have an interest on what it is that I really feel the final stages of MGTOW is, truly absconding from society, getting out, you know, I'm more than willing to talk to people about that.  But, you know, yeah, that's all that I really have to say right now.  So I'll be back on this channel very soon.  I don't I don't plan on taking down my channel.  You can, you know, download any videos that I have.  If you suspect that I'm going to take things down, go go right ahead.  Download whatever videos.  I'm not renouncing what I've said, but I do not want to.  I can't you know, I can't participate.  Like I can't be, I feel like, I feel like there were people who were expecting me to be some kind of, um, you know, leader or something in the MGTOW community.  And that is, that is something that I cannot be, you know, I don't know if people still feel that way.  I have no idea what's going on in the MGTOW community, um, ever since I left.  Uh, so, so maybe the things that I'm saying about how there was some kind of overlap and encroachment with a lot of, uh, kind of weird alt-right people.  Maybe that's past.  Maybe that's gone and that's not occurring anymore.  I don't know.  But, you know, so I don't know what's going on in MGTOW and men's rights or anything like that.  I don't.  But, you know, I know that I can't be some kind of leader.  I can't do that.  So that's all I have to say for now.  Thank you. ",
