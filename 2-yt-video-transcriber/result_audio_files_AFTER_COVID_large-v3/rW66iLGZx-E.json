I swear I have not watched the video.  I've been told by all of you that I need to check it out.  So I got my headphones plugged in and we're gonna read about some of the fallout here and take a look at what must be the most entitled Twitch streamer of all time.  Times are tough right now.  In fact, if you looked at my pinned comment below, I put out a video on Saturday telling all of you how to get some money from me.  The minimum looks like it's going to be about 10k.  So definitely check out that video.  You only have a few days to sign up to get it.  Hopefully I can help a bunch of you with things.  Now, there's that way to deal with with the tough times.  And then there's this way, apparently.  Let's take a look.  So I saw this video just saying, I'm going to vomit.  I don't know.  I wasn't sure what it was about.  But we can see this article.  Invader V could not seem more entitled and out of touch.  Here's on Deserto.  Invader V under fire for shaming cheapskate viewers for not subbing.  Twitch streamer Invader V is coming under fire for shaming unsubscribed viewers for not supporting her channel monetarily, in spite of current global events that could have caused many to lose their job entirely.  Like many live streaming platforms, Twitch allows viewers a myriad of ways to support their favorite content creators by donating, subscribing, or even gifting subscriptions to others.  However, subscriptions come at a cost and generally include various tiers which viewers get more benefits depending on how much they pay.  Also, by the way, you can run ads on Twitch and earn revenue that way.  Streamer Invader V spoke out on the issue during a broadcast on April 14th where she appeared to shame unsubscribed viewers for not supporting the content they enjoy with a $5 payment.  Okay, I'm unemployed, so basically all of my money goes to bills and food.  I would support you.  Interesting.  Oh my god, there's so many clips.  Now remember, everyone, if you remember Bad Bunny, that was a big hullabaloo back in January for shaming her viewers for not subscribing.  But what she said at least was that it was an act, that she really wasn't mad at people and whatever the case may be.  I don't know if I necessarily believe that.  Maybe it's true.  Maybe it's not.  Let's take a look at the newest Bad Bunny.  Perhaps the most legendary, out of touch queen on Twitch.  Let's see here.  Okay.  Really?  It doesn't matter how much money you make or how much money you have.  Okay, let's take a look. ",
