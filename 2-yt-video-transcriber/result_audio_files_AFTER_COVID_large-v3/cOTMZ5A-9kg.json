And that's what the coronavirus has kind of exacerbated.  So I expect serious problems.  I mean, in terms of civil unrest, and I expect pretty draconian responses from our internal security systems, which and you can look at Ferguson to get a sense of what that will look like.

They don't have rights.  So that's what's happened in our deindustrialized society.  urban centers where poor people of color live.  They've already been stripped of due process habeas corpus.  94% of the people in our prison system never had a jury trial.  They're coerced into pleading out, often to crimes they didn't commit.  You have police, the ability of heavily armed militarized you know with long barreled weapons and kevlar vests to carry out uh lethal force.  um i think a thousand people are murdered a year in these what Malcolm X called these internal colonies.  Police are almost never held accountable, even when they're filmed carrying out these kind of activity on cell phones.  And so you both have the legal and the physical mechanisms to create a dystopian, totalitarian state.  And Arendt writes that this is very dangerous because once unrest spreads throughout the wider society and once rights become privileges with the flick of a switch, everybody.  And so that's all.  the legal and physical mechanisms are already there. ",

That's kind of the model.  they that i mean it is kind of animal form.  i mean that tiny little elite will have everything.  uh will have nothing.  and um the mechanisms of control which are the most sophisticated in human history uh and we're watched of course 24 hours a day and we of course can't wait to help them by like going on google and carrying around our tracking devices.  uh that uh When the government watches you 24 hours a day, you can't use the word liberty.  That is the relationship of a master and a slave.  And we're already watched.  We're the most watched, monitored, photographed, surveilled population in human history.  And all of our information is stored in perpetuity so they can use it whenever they want.  And they will use it.  And if we become a problem, we have created the most efficient form of totalitarianism.  i mean i just did.  the last show that was broadcast on on contact was with bill binney and we talked about this swiss company that uh did encryption devices which the cia ran and all that.  but we i was asking him bill binney was in the nsa as a whistleblower he he actually was one of the major architects of trailblazer which is used as monitor all of us.  and then he got out and told the american public and he's paid a heavy price for it.  but but he's saying now because the internet the the system of surveillance is so much more efficient than it has ever been um that they can just tap into uh you know these electronic data systems and they have everything.  so um that's going to make it extremely difficult to organize.  i mean when i was involved with occupy.  uh after bloomberg in his first failed attempt to shut down Zuccotti Park, the direct action committee came down to Princeton for a couple days and camped out on my floor and were taking my kid, who was like four or five on their shoulders, running up and down the street as fast as they could, much to my wife's dismay.  But they're great.  They're amazing people.  But anyway, they wanted to... uh, figure out a way that they knew Bloomberg was going to come back.  They knew the park was going to shut down, but they wanted to figure out some kind of a protest to show.  And the park was just riddled with agent provocateurs, a lot of them in the black lock spies guys.  I mean, they were kind of, it was out of dunes bearing away.  It was these kind of buff guys with a backpack who always said they were from Reed college, uh, And they were there.  I don't know why they picked Duke College.  And you could always tell who they were because they were always, like, trying to chat people up saying, so who's the leader?  Who's the leader here?  And you try to explain to them that it's them.  Like the Wizard of Oz in some tent somewhere.  And so they went to the medical tent and said this to the woman who ran the medical tent.  And they go, so who's the leader here?  And this is one of these cops.  And she goes, well, I am.  And he goes, really?  And he goes, what are you in charge of?  She goes, everything.  He goes, what's your title?  And she goes, God.  So how did I get off on that tangent?  Oh, yeah.  So anyway, they decided that they were going to do some kind of a protest when they came back.  But now this is before Snowden.  All the electronic equipment went into my car outside in the driveway.  Nothing was discussed.  We only wrote on pieces of paper, and then we burned them in the fireplace.  And there could have been, but there wasn't, somebody within that group who was working on behalf of the security state.  And the decision was that when they invaded, they would chain themselves to the kitchen, which was in the central part of Zuccotti.  So when they went in, Bloomberg went in again to shut down the park, they got to the kitchen and there were 20 activists chained and they didn't have chain cutters.  And it was just a way to say to the police, you don't know everything.  But that's the world we inhabit.  We inhabited then and now, and that's the world we're going to inhabit. ",
