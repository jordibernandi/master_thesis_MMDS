            "text": "Hello, Encounter Today family.  I want to talk to you about a prophetic word that God gave me months ago that I believe we are beginning to see its fulfillment starting today.  And in just a moment, I'm even going to show you a clip of what we said here.  I believe it was two months ago.  But suffice it to say that what we saw at the Capitol was egregious and infuriating because of how wrong it was and because of how much it will be used to set conservative principles back in this nation.  violence and destruction of property is wrong full stop and those who participated should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.  Those who say they support law and order, who have through the last year condemned BLM and Antifa and condemned the pulling down of statues, cannot remain consistent if they in any way make excuse for the events we saw yesterday.  On the other hand... Those who have supported BLM either directly or indirectly through their silent complicity need to keep their mouths shut as well.  They have zero credibility and have contributed actually to the conditions we find ourselves in.  This year the liberal left taught Americans that violence is perfectly alright so long as you have a good reason.  We were schooled night after night for four months as federal buildings were occupied, police stations burned to the ground and innocent lives were lost.  BLM, as an example, caused $2 billion in damage.  And in response, what was their reward?  Major corporations, Hollywood celebrities, and woke preachers gave them $10 billion.  The very same people who reported mostly peaceful protests with a car on fire behind them are now laboring what we're seeing today as seditious.  We've had felons, drug dealers, and those who attack police officers hailed as heroes, while recently a 14-year military veteran is labeled as a villain.  Something suspicious is going on, but here's what we do know.  All violence is wrong.  All destruction of property is wrong.  And only those who have been screaming that from the top of their lungs for the last 12 months or 4 to 12 years have the right to say anything right now.  Well, Pastor Allen, people feel disenfranchised, unheard, abused.  Listen to me, that is no excuse.  And that's not the reason they're rioting anyway.  I believe that God has called all of us to spiritual battle and to spiritual warfare.  And when you ignore that call, because it's difficult, it's easy to get your wires crossed.  And I'm talking to BLM, I'm talking to Antifa, and I'm talking to those who stormed the Capitol.  You think what you needed to do was to really storm the Capitol or riot when what you really needed to do was to storm heaven and to bind the spirit behind all the evil that you see in this nation.  The command you've received, the commission you have in your spirit can never be accomplished by the arm of the flesh.  So I implore you, Join a real movement of believers who are actually addressing the root issues and you'll find a peace and a fulfillment that you never even dreamed imaginable.  God was not taken by surprise by the events that happened, nor will he be taken by surprise by what comes next.  I want to share with you a prophecy that God spoke through us right here at the counter today months ago.  It's only a few seconds long, but I believe it's being fulfilled right now.  Because for about four months now, I've really felt strongly in my spirit that that the story of jezebel's daughter athaliah held prophetic significance for us moving into 2021 and i want you to see what we said months ago athaliah possibly more deadly than jezebel but she's more sinister.

            "text": "she works underneath the surface.  she's not as overt.  she is much more covert than her mother.  jezebel has some of the same characteristics But this is particularly a political spirit that accuses of treason.  Now, the moment the new king was put into place, the war was not over.  The moment the election was finished, the war was not over.  Athaliah was still alive.  and she was still accusing of treason.  This is just a fascinating parallel to me, to what I believe we're heading into.  So just because no matter how things turn out, don't think that the warfare is over.  We are going to see accusations the likes of which we have never seen.  And it's going to take the sword of the Spirit, the truth of the Word of God, in order to cut through the clutter of the conflicting extremes that are taking place in the political, cultural, and church world.  But if we will do it, we will see a rise of the remnant, and we will see the Joashes of the church take their place and begin to operate in their authority.  Somebody say amen.  Amen. ",
