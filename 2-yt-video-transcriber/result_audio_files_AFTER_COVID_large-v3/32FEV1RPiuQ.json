            "text": "In my last video, I explained how the sacrifice of horses was an essential royal right in the Indo-European religion.  In this video, I will show how a magic spell from medieval Germany proves that ancient Indo-Europeans also had special rights to keep their horses alive by healing them with magic.

Odin, the chief god of the Vikings, had an eight-legged horse called Sleipnir, and pre-Viking age depictions of Odinic warriors are sometimes mounted.  The association of Odin with horses is very old and not limited to Norse sources.  In Germany, he was called Wotan and is invoked in the second Merseburg charm to heal a horse's leg.  Horses were valuable possessions, so it makes sense that an aristocratic god like Odin was the patron of a horse cult, and it's easy to understand why horse owners were anxious about their prized possessions being injured.  The charm was written in High German by a cleric at an abbey in the 10th century, but is certainly of pagan origin.  Foll and Wodan were riding to the woods, and the foot of Baldr's foal was sprained.  So Synthkund, Suna's sister, conjured it, and Freya, Vola's sister, conjured it, and Wodan, conjured it as well he could.  Like bone sprain, so blood sprain, so joint sprain, bone to bone, blood to blood, joint to joints, so may they be glued.  Now this same exact formula survived up in Sweden as recently as the 19th century in several different versions.  This one was written down in 1860.  A very similar charm is found in the Atarvaveda, which was compiled in India between 1200 BC and 1000 BC.  It uses basically the exact same formula.  That bone of thine which, injured and burst, exists in thy person, Datar, shall kindly knit together again, joint with joint.  Thy marrow shall unite with marrow, and thy joint with joint, the part of thy flesh that has fallen off, and thy bone shall grow together again.  thy marrow shall be joined together with marrow.  the skin grow together with skin.  thy blood thy bone shall grow.  thy flesh grow together with flesh.  fit together hair with hair and fit together skin with skin.  thy blood thy bone shall grow what is cut.  join thou together o plant do thou here.  rise up go forth run forth as a chariot with sound wheels.  firm fellow and strong knave stand upright firmly.  similar versions also exist in a christian form in ireland where they are preserved in very recent accounts collected in the folklore archives of university college dublin.  this one for example was contributed by a schoolchild in county cork.  in nineteen thirty eight.  our Lord God went a-hunting through moors and through mountains.  his foal's foot rested.  he sat down and blessed it saying from bone to bone from flesh to flesh every sinew in its own place.  now this Irish example was not borrowed from the Vikings or the Norse who invaded Ireland.  Rather, it is an indigenous version and derives from the story of the Second Battle of Maiturid, where Mirch heals the arm of Nuada, the king of the gods, called Tuadadana, using the same Indo-European magic formula as was normally used on horses elsewhere.  I should point out that variants of the spell in which Jesus is invoked can also be found in Scotland.  And there's also a variant found in Finland.  Going back to the Norse, they also used horses for curses too.  namely the N\u00ed\u00f0stang or shame pole.  In two Viking sagas, Egilsaga and Vatnsdala saga, a ritual is described in which a horse's head is severed and placed on a pole and then faced towards an enemy so that it serves both as an insult and as a type of curse to harm them.  The runes carved on the pole seemed just as important as the horse head in this ride, with the runes describing and causing the harm itself, while the head served to direct that harm in the desired direction.  I urge you all to go and watch my much longer video on horse sacrifices in Indo-European religion if you want to understand why horses were the most important animal in the Indo-European religion of the Bronze Age steppes.  Thanks for watching.  I'll see you next time. ",
