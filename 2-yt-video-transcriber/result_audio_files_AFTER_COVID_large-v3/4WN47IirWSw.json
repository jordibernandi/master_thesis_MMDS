And the whole time growing up, they teach you that he sat down and turned each leaf and read the words in the Reformed Egyptian.  I'm doing the quote marks with my hand.  That's a fake language.  And wrote it down.  And then, or he said the words and then it described right there.  But if you look in the history, the Joseph Smith Papers, which the church pushes at josephsmithpapers.org, so you can go look at the original text.  There's not one place in there where it says Joseph Smith looked at the plates.  The whole time, he always talks about that stone and the hat, which we all know, right?  We hear that a lot, that he read the stone and the hat.  But there's another piece to that that they still don't talk about.  And that part is that he read word from word off of the stone and that the words did not disappear off of the stone until the text was correct by the scribe.  So then that leads me to question one.  Why did they change the text?  Was the rock wrong?  Was God wrong?  Or did Joseph make it up?  We all know the right answer. ",

And they have sacrament, which is where everybody meets, and then they have Sunday school, which is where the men and women meet together, and then the youth go someplace else.  Then they have a third session, which is where the men separate from the women, and they each get their own instruction.  During this men's section, they would talk about Treating your wives kindly and being nice to them, which is good, right?  You want to treat your wife kindly.  But then the very next words out of their mouth would be like, for Mother's Day, you need to do the dishes and make dinner.  I'm like, wait, how is that treating your wife nicely? ",
