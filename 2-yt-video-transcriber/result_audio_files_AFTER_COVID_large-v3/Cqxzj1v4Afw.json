There were many folks in the House who thought that the Democratic majority was going to grow, and instead they lost six incumbent seats.  in the House.  They thought that they could get the Senate.  And it looks like they're going to fall a little bit short.  So you're going to have a divided government no matter what.  And that's not what you need when you're trying to recover from an historic pandemic, a loss of millions of jobs because of the recession.  So the disappointment is very, very real among Democrats.
