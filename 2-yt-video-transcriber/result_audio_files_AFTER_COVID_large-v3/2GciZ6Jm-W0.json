And we have now multiple cases pending in multiple states, challenging the outcomes of the election, calling for recounts, contesting the election.  And that litigation has to be adjudicated.  And it's very difficult for any of us, for you or me or for someone reading Twitter, to know what exactly is right and accurate about these allegations and what isn't.  That's why we have a judicial system.  We have a judicial system to test facts, and the obligation now of the Trump campaign's lawyers is to go and prove their case, put on direct evidence, put on expert witnesses, have it subjected to cross-examination and prove up the case.  And the overarching objective should be to ensure that every legal vote is counted and but also that every vote that was illegally cast is not counted, and that's the process that's playing out right now.

            "text": "Yeah, and that certainly suggests that when those ballots come under the next set of scrutiny, that you're going to see a significant additional set of ballots invalidated.  So one of the things that gives the greatest cause for optimism \u2013 is this election.  in the time of COVID, there's a pretty marked disparity in terms of how the votes were distributed.  On election day with in-person voting, Donald Trump won a significant majority of the votes cast by in-person voting on election day.  Of mail-in voting, Joe Biden won a significant majority of the votes cast early on mail-in voting.  Now, here's the good news.  If you look historically to recounts, if you look historically to election litigation, the votes cast in person on election day tend to stand.  It's sort of hard to screw that up.  Those votes are generally legal, and they're not set aside.  Mail-in votes historically have a much higher rate of rejection, which is what you pointed out, than when they're examined online.  There are a whole series of legal requirements that vary state by state, but mail-in voters \u2013 mail-in votes consistently have a higher rate of rejection, which suggests that as these votes begin being examined and subject to scrutiny that you're going to see Joe Biden's vote tallies go down.  That's a good thing.  The challenge is for President Trump \u2013 To prevail, he's got to run the table.  He's got to win not just in one state but in several states.  That makes it a lot harder to prevail in the litigation.  I hope that he does so, but it is a real challenge, and we shouldn't try to convince ourselves otherwise. ",

We have seen the evidence on what the media has done.  We've seen the evidence of what was happening in Ukraine.  We have seen the evidence of the Russian collusion case.  And no one ever seems to pay for their crimes.  We know what Hillary Clinton did.  We know what Barack Obama did.  I mean, we could go back all the way to Benghazi or beyond.  And again, no one pays for the crime.  I think people feel like, who's going to fight for me that's not beholden to the system?  Who's going to fight for me if Donald Trump goes away? ",

None of them have been prosecuted.  And it's maddening. ",

And Jeff is a decent man for whom the job was simply too big.  He was not up for the job.  He did not do a good job of it, and there was no accountability for the first couple of years.  Bill Barr came in.  Barr is a much better attorney general.  I'm grateful at least that Barr \u2013 has initiated investigations and assigned prosecutors to go after these folks, but they haven't done it yet, and we are potentially running out of time.  So I don't know what the hell is taking \u2013 I don't know either.  But it is \u2013 from my perspective in the Senate, sometimes it's interesting.  Social media is interesting.  I'll have people yell at me, well, Cruz, why don't you prosecute them?  Well, under our constitutional system, that's not actually an authority I have.  I'm in the legislature.  I can introduce legislation.  I can pass legislation.  I can convene hearings, and I've chaired hearings repeatedly.  In fact, just this week we had Andrew McCabe, the former deputy director at the FBI, who at the hearing I cross-examined and lit him up.  But I don't have the ability to convene a grand jury and secure an indictment.  Only the executive branch can do that.  And so I can call for it, but it's got to be the executive branch that actually executes it. ",

There is some possibility if you do that you'll get prosecuted for voter fraud, but that would be after the fact, and that would be after a crazy left-wing socialist Democrat was elected.  And let me be very clear.  If the Democrats win these two seats, and it's very possible that they win these two seats, then we go from a 52-48 Senate to a 50-50 Senate.  If Joe Biden is president, that means Chuck Schumer wins.  is majority leader.  If Chuck Schumer is majority leader, there will be zero constraints on the most radical left-wing ideas they're pursuing.  If Chuck Schumer is majority leader, they will end the filibuster.  They will pass a massive tax increase.  They will enact the Green New Deal, which will destroy millions of jobs, especially in the state of Texas.  And not only that, they will add two new states to the union designed to get four new Democratic senators immediately.  And they will pack the U.S.  Supreme Court.  They will add four new left-wing activist judges who will take away our free speech rights, our religious liberty rights, our Second Amendment rights.  All of that threat is a clear and present danger, and it all happens January 5th one way or the other. ",
