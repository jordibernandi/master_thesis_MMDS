Dr.  Banner, I hope you're in there!  Please, wake us now!  Listen!  Dr.  Banner!  Dr.  Banner!  Dr.  Banner, can we talk about this?  Look, I need your help, alright?  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  Leave me alone!  Please don't kill me.  Please don't kill me.  Please don't kill me.  Please don't kill me.  Now to find Hulk and get out of here.  What you got there, cricket?  Why did you let me have that?  I don't think so.  Disappointing.  You're not looking wrong.  All units, find the girl and stay out of my way.  There's something wrong with you.  Something different.  It's Banner inside of you and is killed.  Nothing for you.  Couldn't get rid of that.  Couldn't.  Jordan, I'm stuck somewhere in between you and the mindless great ape.  Maybe not an ape after all.  I found the archive schematics!  I think I can find my way to you!  Can't wait for her to join us.  Shut up!  Shut up!  Is it... dead?  Hey, where are we anyway?  Right, I'm talking to myself. ",
