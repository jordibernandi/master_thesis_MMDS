We would have lost potentially millions of people.  Now, it would have been unsustainable.  It would have been impossible to do.  And the American people have been so disciplined.  It's been my honor to be their president.  I've said it before.  I'll say it again.  I'll say it always.  It's been my great honor to have been their president.  And I have a big decision coming up, and I only hope to God that it's the right decision.  But it'll be based on the input from a lot of very talented people, very smart people, and people that love our country.  Thank you all very much.  Thank you.  Thank you very much. ",
