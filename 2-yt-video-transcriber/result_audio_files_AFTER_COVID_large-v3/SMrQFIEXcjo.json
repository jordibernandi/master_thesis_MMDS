            "text": "I had a dream recently that I believe is from the Lord, so I will share this one.  I was on an airplane, and when we got to a high altitude, the airplane shut off, went off, like the electricity went off.  And then the thing just fell down like a rock.  Now, when it fell, I wasn't in the airplane.  I was still up above looking at it.  But I looked at the plane falling like a rock, and it hit water.  And funny enough, it didn't get destroyed.  It just hit the water.  Then I think it was the same plane again.  We went up again.  And the second time, the same thing happened.  And the electricity went off.  And then it started falling.  And it fell like a rock.  Now this time, the second time, I'm thinking, I've got my science hat on even in the dream.  And I'm thinking, wait a second.  Even if you shut off a plane, so what?  The plane should be able to glide.  But it did not glide.  It fell like a rock down to the bottom.  But funny enough, sure enough, again, I wasn't in the plane.  I was looking at it and the plane fell straight down into water and it didn't break into pieces, but it certainly had a crash.  So I thought, you know, we got to figure out what's going on with this plane because if we take this plane up again and it happens again, that's not going to be good.  So third time this plane was flying, I was in it and I said, we got to find out what's going on here.  What is causing this to happen?  And we found out, it wasn't me personally, I'm kind of a bystander, I feel like I'm observing it, but somebody found out that there was an air hostess, or what you would call a flight attendant today, who plugged in her shaver, plugged in a shaver, electric shaver into the airplane and for some reason this airplane had not been equipped I guess to handle this electric shaver.  and when she does that the whole thing shuts down again and it doesn't just glide down.  it fell like a rock to the bottom again.  I wasn't in the airplane I was quite safe and looking down at the airplane I thought well I don't think people died and I don't think that the plane was destroyed.  And when I woke up, I asked the Lord, what does that mean?  If you know dream language, there are certain repetitions and patterns.  And so generally speaking, these patterns hold.  But, you know, it could have a specific meaning that will be revealed later.  And I'm fine with that.  But let's just go with what's generally acceptable.  Any vehicle generally is a metaphor or a symbol of your career or your ministry.  So a bus, depending on what you do for a living, but a bus, a van, a car, a boat, a plane.  Now, this case, this plane was a big plane.  So this was not my plane.  I was an observant in it, an observer in this plane.  So I think that... My initial interpretation, my initial understanding of this dream is that a lot of the mega churches during the coronavirus are going to be suffering.  They got big and they got high, but they will come crashing down.  They cannot just even glide.  They're not going to glide down.  They're going to fall like a rock.  No one's going to die.  People are not going to have to lose their faith.  But through the coronavirus, a lot of people are realizing small is good.  Even medium is good.  But being big does not necessarily mean it's the best.  And there are a lot of carnal Christians who think that because their church is bigger, that they are somehow better.  This has got to end.  This wrong concept of God's kingdom.  is coming to a crash, is coming to a halt.  But who is it that instigated this?  I thought this was interesting.  There was a woman inside, a hostess.  I don't know if that means any play on word.  Generally, it's a play on word like a host or hosting or hosting services.  I don't know if that has anything to do with it.  But the word that certainly makes biblical sense to me is the word shaver.  She plugged in the shaver, and the moment she did, the electricity went out.  And there certainly is an incident in the Bible just like that, which wasn't in my mind whatsoever, but it came to me afterwards when we looked at the Bible.  And it was when Delilah, another woman, Delilah shaved Samson's hair off.  And here was a big guy, and here was a powerful guy who lost all his strength, all his might.  And he came, you know, crashing down, straight down.  He fell like a rock and hit bottom.  Interestingly, Samson also didn't die.  He was given an opportunity after he was in prison.  His eyes were gouged out.  He was blinded.  He was given an opportunity to rise again and do God's call.  But I think this is what God is saying prophetically to Samson.  the churches that think that they are better and think that they are large, that you need to come back and do what God called you to do.  And you need not to compromise on the Word of God.  And if God sets certain standards, it's not old-fashioned.  It's not pass\u00e9.  It is relevant today.  It will be true now and forever.  So we are here to preach the Word of God.  And we're not to be afraid of what politicians, these temporary rulers during our time, they are fleeting like grass.  And it doesn't matter what they say and what they try to control.  They cannot take away our right, our freedom of speech, our religious freedom.  And we will exercise those rights.  And we will not allow them to pressure us.  We will not allow the big tech to pressure us.  We will not allow money to pressure us.  A lot of pastors have compromised because they're afraid if they say, thus saith the Lord, that they may lose tithes and offerings.  Well, you know what?  You're going to lose tithes and offerings.  Every time I put out a video, I lose some subscribers.  I lose some donors.  But you know what?  I didn't do it for them.  I did it because God said it.  We've got to come to a point where we do things because we're under commission.  Humbly.  Humbly.  Not arrogantly, not that we're better.  Everyone is under commission.  But not everyone is following orders.  Some people give their own orders.  And this is the trouble that people are in.  These planes are going to their own destinations.  They're flying at their own altitudes.  And God says, I'm going to pull the electricity right out.  I mean, he doesn't do it in the dream.  It's the equivalent of Delilah that did it.  And it's the shaving.  Don't allow people to shave your anointing.  Don't allow donors to shave your anointing.  Don't allow political pressure laws to shave your anointing.  I will not allow anyone to shave my spiritual head of hair.  I want to keep my anointing.  And I want to see the planes fly.  You know, I was an observer, but I felt bad for the planes to drop out of the sky.  It's not good, and thank God no one died.  So we're all not in this together.  You know, they're saying this all the time.  We're all in this together.  And that has such... I'm so concerned when people say that because it has such a dual meaning.  When people say we're in this together, it means two things.  One... the way that we say, the way that I would think, it means that I'm ready to sacrifice for you.  I'm ready to help you.  You know, we're in this together.  But there's another camp that's probably representing at least 50%.  When they say we're in this together, it means you owe me.  When I'm in trouble, I'm entitled to take from you.  I'm expecting that since we're in this together, you're going to be parting with your property and parting with your taxes, and you're going to be giving it to me.  We're in this together.  And this is what I'm concerned about when the politicians say it.  when a lot of the radical left-wingers say that.  We're in this together.  No, no, no.  My money and my pool of tax is not yours.  It is not yours.  All right?  Go and be productive and hardworking.  So we're in this together as long as you're following Jesus Christ.  We're in this together.  But I'm not going on the plane that's crashing down to the water or that train that's going down to hell.  Not me.  I am not in this together with you.  I'm in this with Jesus.  Amen?  So don't allow anyone to shave your anointing off and be very careful about the pride that comes with some money, some success, and some power because God is pulling the plug on that.  And the coronavirus is a time where we need to assess that and walk in purity, walk with a pure heart before the Lord.  So let's just all repent right now.  We've been doing our own stuff, flying our own plane, building our own kingdom.  And let's really work together with the Lord under his commission and follow his orders and obey his commands.  I believe that's what the dream means.  But I am open.  If you receive anything else, feel free to put some comments down below, and I'd love to hear from you.  God bless you.  Thank you for opening up your heart to Jesus and listening to this.  Keep looking up. ",
