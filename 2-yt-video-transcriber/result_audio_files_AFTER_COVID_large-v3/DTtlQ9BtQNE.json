            "text": "Ladies and gentlemen, my name is Justin Brad with the Unboxing Theory YouTube channel.  I just want to talk about really quick, head-to-head, AMD Ryzen Threadripper 3990X, which is 64 cores, 128 threads, versus the AMD EPYC 7742, which is also 64 cores, 128 threads.  Now, I've watched some videos from Linus Tech Tips and some other people about these two guys going head-to-head.  There's some things that they've missed, okay?  And I know it sounds weird because they're supposed to be the smartest.  They're supposed to be, what, the biggest YouTube channels out there.  But they've missed something.  And I'm going to see if I can go over this and explain it to you.  Because contrary to popular belief, Linus Tech Tips was wrong.  You do not have to have Intel Optane memory to keep up.  with an AMD Ryzen Threadripper 3990X for two reasons.  There's two, maybe even three, really good alternatives to the Intel Optane memory.  if you don't want to get Intel Optane memory.  First of all, putting these head-to-head, I want to show you the frequencies.  Obviously, the frequency is lower on the Epic, which is a good thing, in my opinion, because it runs cooler, which is something I'm after.  It has 256 megabytes of cache, which is slightly less, and that's because it is a multi-thread server CPU, not a desktop CPU, okay?  The desktop CPU has three levels of cache, and I'm not seeing that reported on the EPYC.  It doesn't mean it doesn't have it.  I'm not going to claim to be a know-it-all, okay?  There very well might be three levels of cache on the EPYC, but it's not advertised that way where I'm reading about.  They both have 64 cores, 128 threads.  They both support DDR3200 megahertz memory, and apparently... There's some overclockability with the Threadripper.  But if you do use 3200 MHz memory, you have to use less memory.  You can't use the maximum capacity.  Also, if you're really going to use the AMD Ryzen Threadripper 3 990X for video rendering and parallel computing and maximum overdrive applications... You're going to need, I'm just going to say, a minimum, I would say, of at least 64 gigabytes of RAM.  You can try to do it with 32.  Not a good idea, but you could do it when you're doing 4K video rendering, this sort of thing.  And a lot of people say 256.  Seeing as how if you've got 64 cores and 128 threads, You want about two gigabytes per thread.  Somebody said AMD recommends that.  I don't know about AMD recommending that.  That's what I recommended.  Then you would need to max it out, right?  You'd need to max out the 256 gigabytes of RAM.  I don't care.  What I care about is what am I going to use the thing for?  So if I'm doing video editing, 4K Ultra HD videos, I'm looking for 256 gigabytes of RAM minimum, okay?  That's what I'm looking for with a 64-core CPU.  You could try to do it with 128 gigabytes of RAM.  I don't know how well that would work.  The program, I think, would definitely have enough memory.  It's whether or not each thread has enough access to memory.  It needs to have access to a lot of memory so that it can basically raid the RAM, if that makes sense.  We need to be able to put whatever each thread is working on in a certain place in RAM where it has more access to it.  The other thing that I'm not quite sure about is the Ryzen Threadripper 3 990X's direct memory access.  It looks like it has four memory channels and two on each side of the CPU apparently.  I don't know how that works with eight chiplets if they all have direct memory access as well as with the EPYC.  I think because the EPYC has eight memory channels, It's definitely going to perform better in terms of memory communication, and also I believe that that memory is encrypted, whereas I don't know about the Threadripper 3 990X.  And there's pros and cons to encrypting your RAM.  Both of them support PCI Express 4.0.  And I believe Epic has more bandwidth on that.  I could be wrong, but Epic usually has more bandwidth.  Ryzen Threadripper 3 990X has NVMe RAID supported.  I don't know if Epic does.  I only assume that it can be done with Epic, okay?  Because I haven't seen that in the advertising, in the literature.  Okay, I'm going to go out here a little bit.  Now, I do have a suggestion for third-gen EPYC, by the way, and that would be that they enable two to four of the cores or threads in a 64-core configuration to boost up to, like, you know, 4.3 gigahertz because... And when you're doing parallel computing, there's usually a master program.  And your master program with its master process has to look at the other processes, okay?  It has to monitor and keep track and index all of the different processes on the different threads and try to work them together.  And sometimes the OS does that.  But there's usually one master program that does that.  And the speed limit of your master control program, the MCP, that's going to take over the world, right?  That's from a movie.  Well, your master control program, if it's running at a higher frequency than all of its jobs, it should be able to keep up better because when you do parallel computing, there's a curve.  There's a curve where you can add as many threads as you want to and you don't get more productivity because the master control program, as I call it, can't keep up with having too many threads.  It's like asking, we'll say, an operator, a human being that's an operator on a telephone network to manage 256 phone calls simultaneously, the more phone calls that that operator has to route, routing people's phone calls, the slower that that operator's gonna be at doing that, the less efficient.  And because they're the master control program, yes, they can hook up an infinite number of calls together at once on their control board for however big their control board is.  But there's only one of them that's in control of what's happening.  And that's the deal with parallel computing.  There are some technical terms for that that I've heard long ago and I can't think of them right now.  But anyway, we're going to continue on.  To take full advantage of the speed, you need Intel Optane Memory.  That's what Linus Tech Tips said, right?  Well, there's other ways to handle this, and I've looked it up to make sure.  He said, Linus Tech Tips said that the IOPS was the big issue.  You had to have Intel Optane Memory.  You had to have Intel Optane Memory.  Well, from what I'm looking at with IOPS and read-write speeds, that's just not true.  Because Sabrent, which is the brand of NVMe I have in this machine, my old 2012 machine, it has IOPS up to 750,000 IOPS, okay, which is higher than the Intel Optane memory that I have seen.  And also its read write speeds are pretty high too, like in the 5000s or so.  Let's take a little peek at that really quick.  If we go down here, remember it's PCI 4, which is important.  PCI Express 4.0 times 4, so that should be able to keep up.  There should be no issue there.  It is rated for 1,700,000 hours, so it should work.  for a while.  Now, I'm not saying you should trust your NVMe solid states to just keep working forever and never poop out and never back them up or anything.  You obviously should have the data backed up to a hard drive somewhere.  Max sequential reads are 5,000 megabytes per second.  Now, for me, that's important, okay, because I'm doing video rendering.  And what is my video renderer doing?  It's looking at the project files before it's writing anything, before it's compiling, putting things together.  It's reading the source material.  So reading, in my opinion, it might be more important than write speeds.  Now, there is memory out there that I've seen that I think has faster write than read, and that might be something you're interested in for your project.  But for what I'm doing, as far as I know, and I could be wrong, could do some experiments and find out I'm completely wrong here.  From my point of view, as long as I can read the project files quickly, the writing isn't as important because the program, yes, the program does need to be able to write it back.  And since it's all on one SSD, which I mean you can use two, right?  You can either do RAID or you could use two separate ones, which I've done with hard drives and sped up my rendering.  Okay, so even if you're using slow hard drives, you get the same factor where if I'm reading from one hard drive and writing to another one, it speeds up my rendering time.  So if I have two NVMEs and one NVME isn't enough to keep up with the reads and the writes, which I think this one should be able to, then I could put my project files on one NVMe and have it write to the other one, or I could just RAID them, okay?  And it would double the speed, theoretically, of my reads and writes between both of them if I RAIDed them.  So then I'd have 10,000 megabits per second read and 8,800 megabytes per second write.  Not megabits, megabytes.  That's what it's saying here, okay?  So that should be enough.  Should be enough to keep up.  with the Threadripper in the Epic, I would think.  I would think.  I've been told that the Epic, the older versions of the Epic, could run at 170 gigabytes per second, okay?  5,000 megabytes per second is almost 5 gigabytes per second.  So I'm hoping that that will work.  Now, with 750 IOPS... I think 750,000 IOPS, I think we're doing fine on the IOPS.  I think that the only thing we might need to be concerned about is our read and write speed.  So as long as, you know, our processor can get to the, you know, and if you've got a chipset, if you're doing the threader, if you've got a chipset, we've got to be able to get to the data we're reading from for the project, okay?  bring it into RAM, bring it into memory, compile it, do whatever we're going to do with it, and then spit it back out again.  Now, if spitting it out slows it down, that may or may not be an issue to you.  I mean, you can use a RAM disk, you can use a RAM drive, if you've got two terabytes of RAM.  It probably will slow things down a little bit, but you can use a RAM disk if it actually speeds it up somehow because it'll slow the overall system down, but it can actually speed things up in terms of memory performance.  And the RAM disk is temporary.  Every time you restart the computer, it's gone.  It's a potential.  There are experiments that can be done here to find out how to get the most potential out of these CPUs.  And right now, to me, that doesn't seem to be an issue.  I mean, if you can stick two of these NVMe 4.0s in a Ryzen Threadripper 3 990X and give it 250 gigabytes of RAM, it should be adequate for any 4K Ultra HD video rendering tasks that you throw at it.  today now when you start going to you know the future and you need to add more ram to that thread ripper.  you may wish you had an epic.  it's a whole other deal now of course with the epics.  as i've mentioned over and over again in my videos about the epics.  you can use two of them and get up to 256 threads and you know it is kind of funny.  My boss, where I work part-time doing property inspections and stuff, he calls me just in 256.  256 threads, 256 gigabytes of RAM.  As for me and my house, I have the money or the sponsorship or whatever.  I want to go with epic and I want to do something very epic, by the way.  Maybe I shouldn't talk about that.  I'll tell you what, I've got ideas for this thing to make it do crazy things, but I'm not going to talk about it in this video because somebody will steal my idea.  I better not talk about how to do that in this video because there are people with more money than me.  out there who've already got these things in their hands.  And, you know, the potential for somebody out there like Linus Tech Tips or somebody else out there to steal my ideas are huge.  So I better just keep my mouth shut until the Lord puts two of these things in my hands and I get to have some fun with them.  Anyways, thanks so much for watching the video.  And God bless you.  And I really do hope that I can do what you guys want to see.  And build one of these machines very soon on my channel.  Just for fun and because I need it.  It's a tool.  I'm not the guy.  You know, if you want me to be the overclocking guy for you guys, for YouTube, I'll do that.  But I'm not the overclocking guy.  I would rather have something run stable for long periods of time and do amazing things.  And that's what my 2012 video editing machine has proven.
