            "text": "I'm outta here.  I'm outta here.  There's.  the undercover is obviously there to control by.  let's get the undercover officers face on camera.  So that's what the undercover officers look like.  They're not undercover anymore.  You guys got to paint some track marks or something.  You don't look like you fit here.  Thank you very much.  Stop being an undercover.  Undercover career is over now, man.  Oh, yeah.  So now when this video goes out, anyone who's watching can know that they don't do controlled buys with this dude.  What's your name and badge number, guy?  Name and badge number, bro.  What's your name and badge number, guy?  Bro, the undercover career is over.  That's done for.  I'm way too big for you to be undercover anymore.  What's your name and badge number, guy?  Are you failing to ID for your departmental policy?  Private property, maybe you want to trespass?  What's up, guy?  Another undercover right there pulling in the wrong side of the street.  I'm gonna hang with this dude here.  Guy, you gotta get some track marks or something.  You're way too healthy to be out here getting high.  No one's gonna buy that shit.  Maybe he did.  No one else will.  Doing good work on the streets here, huh, guy?  What is it, the gold chain and the Nike?  People even know, even the junkies out here got all fucking Nike.  No one's wearing Adidas and Nike, guy.  Trust me, I used to be out here.  Still out here.  Yeah, catching you guys.  Honey, catching you guys.  Happy birthday.  Thank you.  Listen, how about I just turn around and walk away and you tell me your name and badge number?  No name and badge number, right, dude?  Are you a police officer?  Are you a police officer?  Want to show me a badge or something?  Are you a police officer with the Boston Police Department?  You're required to answer that question.  I look up there too.  G4, C6, where you at?  Social distancing, man.  Don't keep turning back towards me.  If you won't tell me you're a cop, how am I supposed to know?  Are you going back to the Ave?  You can hang out there.  This is called the Undercover Giveaway Program.  Yeah, operations blown.  is what they're doing out here, guys.  Can you pick me up, Sarge?  It's not working.  Get you on a nice big billboard.  Whoops.  Shame with these masks.  I can't even tell if you're Irish or Italian right now.  It's not going to quite work like that, guy.  I've been doing this too long, man.  Hey, listen, so now I get the FOIA request, that phone, right?  Now I get the FOIA, that phone?  So, guys, now I'm covering my face because he's trying to get a picture.  Didn't work out too well for Big Dog here.  He's like, oh, fuck, now I can't get back to the Ave and start busting people that need help instead of handcuffs.  Oh, what a shitty day.  And you know what chances are growing up around here, right?  Because you can tell by the way he walks.  He's from here.  He's a city boy.  It's a shame what he's doing, really.  Here's what we do next.  His ex-fail is most likely going to be around the corner here.  So if you don't know, guys, a controlled buy is where normally they don't bust in the first time.  They want to establish a connection to a higher dealer, figure out the hierarchy.  Now, this guy's not state PD.  He's local for sure.  This is non-undercover operation anymore.  Fails to ID.  Won't even confirm that he's a Boston police officer, which I've never had happen.  I've had them tell me, like, call.  The only thing he's had to say is, oh, you're still out here.  You can tell there's no hope in his heart for people getting the help that they need.  I wonder how many people he keeps in contact with after his arrests.  This is sad, very sad.  But at least we can say that they're going to have to paint a whole new budget, at least for some of the training.  Here it is, right here.  This should be his car.  This should be his ride.  Eight yellow Juliet 435.  That's eight yellow Juliet 435.  That's the undercover car.  Now he's going to walk by it.  It's cool.  That's cool, got the grill lights there.  Walking in the middle of the road, man.  Ain't that jaywalking guy?  He might be more than 50 feet from the crosswalk.  The name of this video is going to be Used to be Undercover.  Thankfully, I know exactly where I am being a city boy myself.  We got one right there.  Nope.  Megan, you just confirmed for me a BPD and then I'm out of here, man.  There's a crosswalk right there, dude.  Why would you need crosswalks?  When you got the blue line gang sign, you don't need crosswalks.  That's a figment of the imagination.  a crosswalk is.  At least I follow the law.  I'm going to a crosswalk.  That crosswalk arrow is blocked, guys, so I can't press it, which makes me allowed to cross that jaywalk and I'm like this dirtbag.  Hey, wave.  goodbye, bro.  Wave goodbye.  It's your undercover career.  Bye, undercover Korea.  Bye, Felicia. ",
