But it started as fires in the parking lot of the precinct, and now it has moved to what appears to be the front door and other businesses surrounding the precinct also on fire.  And just from walking through there today, There's already so much devastation in AutoZone destroyed and just so many buildings hollowed out with fire.  And now there appears to be more tonight, which is just heartbreaking.  The crowds, you can see, are massive, packed in shoulder to shoulder.  There's another one now at the bottom of the screen burning.  And we are just watching to see how this continues to grow the crowds, the fires, and whether control will be able to be re-exerted on what's going on.  It looks like fireworks of some sort are being shot up into the air as well now. ",

            "text": "Last night on Minneapolis TV, I watched the third precinct building burn.  There were no firefighters trying to put out the fire, no police there to protect the citizens.  Everybody who was supposed to be in charge had run away.  The news stations were alerted to tell everybody to stay clear and expect an explosion.  And beyond that, this symbol of civilization and order was simply allowed to be put to the torch by criminals.  Everybody who has seen the video of a prone and handcuffed George Floyd crying out for help while a police officer held him down with a knee to the neck felt terrible for him.  We all wondered why the cops were not coming to his aid, but none of us has the whole story.  We're not clear as to what happened just prior to the clip we saw, nor do we know for certain as of this moment that he died as a direct result of the way he was being restrained.  The officers were immediately fired, and the mayor had already said, perhaps stupidly, that criminal charges were pending.  And that was enough information for tens of millions of bored, isolated, stressed-out Americans to go to every social media platform and emote.  Virtually every liberal woman on my Facebook feed took it upon herself to not only repost the shocking video, But to come to conclusions about what had happened, many just boldly declared it to be a racist murder.  There was no possible way that a riot would not have happened.  As events built and as police withdrew, politicians issued weak statements more interested in aligning themselves with protesters than in laying down the law.  The escalation of violence was as predictable as the sun setting in the West.  The pandemic overreaction has had the citizens of these cities in lockdown since before the spring thaw.  Many are now unemployed, watching as beloved restaurants and bars and entertainment venues are themselves being choked by a knee to the neck.  But being good, compliant Democrats, most of these citizens just sucked it up and waited.  If you've ever visited Minneapolis in the late spring or early summer, you'll know that the place is usually full of vibrant life.  After being locked down by cold weather for many dark months, people are usually out in force, friendly, open, full of good cheer.  When you live in Minnesota, you don't waste one minute of warm weather on a bad mood because winter will soon be back and the freedom of summer gone again.  But not this year.  This year, the spring is outlawed, and as Don Henley once sang, the summer's out of reach.  When you take away people's joy and replace it with fear and government oppression, you will get anger.  But when you have also spent the last three years saying that the president of the United States is a racist and every one of his voters is out to oppress minorities, you have a damn powder keg on your hands.  Name me a riot in recent decades that has broken out in a Republican-controlled town.  These incidents are always in blue cities.  As is the case now, the police chiefs are very often Black.  The mayors are Democrats, also often Black, and the governors too are usually Democrats.  The Black people in these areas, like most citizens, know very little about politics.  They have been well-programmed by the media and lack the perspective to understand what their leaders have done to them.  They might occasionally hear the word plantation, but few can understand that they live on one.  Few can grasp the obvious reality that to Democrats, they are not so much individual human beings with unique and valuable souls, but rather voting livestock wholly owned by the progressives who have taken over the Democratic Party and who will do or say anything to keep these voters misinformed.  Listen, if you take a child when he is young and as he grows, you fill him with the belief that there is an invisible force called racism that no matter how hard he tries will prevent him from ever being truly free, you break something deep inside of him.  If you then go on to encourage the degradation of his culture so that the music he hears is just a beat, a thumping bass and some angry, inarticulate bragging.  If you send just enough money into the poorest neighborhoods to keep people at the poverty line while condoning the worst behavior among young men and forbidding teachers the use of discipline.  If that kid grows up knowing that the single highest cause of death for young black men is murder and that prison is his likely destination, you keep him broken.  You keep a low fire of rage burning inside of him while endlessly preaching to him that those other people are responsible for everything about his life that he hates.  And then once in a while, when a white cop kills an unarmed black man, you use the media to pour lighter fluid on that barely contained flame.  That is what we see today in Minneapolis, St.  Paul, the inevitable destruction and theft and terror.  And this year we have tens of millions of left-wing civilians who haven't had a normal day since early March taking to the internet to fan the flames with their own posturing.  These people love a cause.  They need a cause.  But the coronavirus shutdown cause is not working anymore.  They can't really believe anymore in the grand mission of social distancing and being together apart.  but they believe every horrible thing that they've ever been spoon fed about the current president.  And by God, this is an election year.  So they have shifted in unison as always to the well-worn narrative of institutional racism and eternal resentment.  And they will not stop no matter what the autopsy shows.  And their foot soldiers in Minneapolis and St.  Paul are more than happy to oblige.  They've been masked up like terrorists for months anyway.  They were frustrated and pent up long before they ever heard of this poor man or the men who pinned him down on the street while he called out for his mama.  I don't know what will happen tonight, but the tragic death of George Floyd has already painted the season with ash and blood.  And given the certainty that at some point in some big liberal city, a black man in custody will die.  This was all as expected as a late spring picnic at the lake used to be.  Thanks for watching.
