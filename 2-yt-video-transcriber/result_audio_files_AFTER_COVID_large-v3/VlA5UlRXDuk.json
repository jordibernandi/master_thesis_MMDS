            "text": "Speed the Light is essential transportation, creative communication, and a compassionate demonstration of the gospel of Jesus Christ.  Speed the Light equips and resources our missionaries and missions organizations with things such as video equipment, sound equipment, and vehicles to help them spread the gospel of Jesus Christ around the globe.  Hi, I'm Micah Coverstone, the Youth and Children's Pastor of Living Word Ministries Assemblies of God in Berksville, Kentucky, and I need your help to raise some money for missions.  This month, our students are participating in a fundraiser for Speed the Light called The Walk.  On October 31st, our students will walk one mile for every $50.  they raise for Speed the Light individually.  These funds will go towards a variety of projects.  For one, they will go towards building clean water wells in Africa and places around the world where families or children have to walk miles to find water that ends up being dirty anyway.  These funds will also go towards saving human trafficking victims who have to walk the streets in dangerous situations.  And lastly, these funds will go towards missionaries to attain and acquire vehicles that will help them get to the destination where they intend to spread the gospel.  That way they don't have to rely on their two feet to get them where God is asking them to go.  If you would like to partner with us in raising this money for Speed the Life, here's what you can do.  At the end of this video, you're gonna see several students that are participating in this fundraiser.  I ask that you find one or more students that you can pledge a certain amount of money to for their walk.  It may be as little as $1, it may be as great as 50 or even higher.  But find that student and remember that they're gonna be walking one mile for every $50 they raise.  Now you may not know any of the students in the end of the video and if that's the case, you can contact me individually and let me know what you wanna do.  My phone number will be on a slide at the end of the video.  If you do know some of these students or if you see where they have shared it on Facebook or Instagram, you can contact them or their parents individually and let them know that you're pledging towards their walk.  Any check that you write will be payable to Living Word Ministries.  And from here, we will send the checks to Speed the Light Missions.  Thank you all for your help and support.  Just remember, we walk so that sex trafficking victims don't have to walk the streets anymore.  We walk so that children and families don't have to walk to find clean water anymore.  We walk so that missionaries will not have to walk to where God has sent them.  We walk.  We walk.  We walk.  We walk.  We walk.  We walk.  We walk.  We walk.  We walk.  We walk.  We walk. ",
