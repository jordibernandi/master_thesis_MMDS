You asked me a question, I'm giving an answer.  No, I do not understand why you stopped me.  One, I was sitting in a car station with the engine off, not running.  You pulled up beside me and persisted to ask me if I was okay.  I nodded my head and said yes.  Then you insisted I wind the window down.  It is not, I just, did we just have this conversation?  Okay, so I just spoke to that lady.  There's no reason, you cannot make me.  You said that several times.  Disproportionate and unhonorable black people are committing crimes.  It is not compulsory.
