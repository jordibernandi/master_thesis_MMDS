            "text": "It's time for an update on the Kenosha Kid.  Hey everybody, welcome back to Guns and Gadgets, your premiere source for Second Amendment news.  And if it's Second Amendment news that you're after, please consider subscribing to this channel because this is where you're going to find it, no matter where it happens.  Good, bad, ugly, or indifferent, you'll find it here on Guns and Gadgets, oftentimes days before you see it anywhere else.  I have two updates.  on Kyle Rittenhouse's scenario here, the charges that he's facing.  There's been a little wrinkle.  But before I get into that, I'm gonna jump into the elephant in the room.  If you're interested in getting one of these Biden Target t-shirts, I will have a link down below.  It's in my Spreadshirt store.  I just made them live.  You know, sometimes you just gotta go with the flow, right?  Alright, let's talk about Kyle Rittenhouse.  So, the last video I did brought us up to the point where he was fighting his extradition to Wisconsin and eventually that day the judge came down and basically sent Kyle off.  And if you're new to the channel and you're not familiar with the Kyle Rittenhouse situation, the Kenosha Kid is what I started calling him that night, basically around the shootings in which he saved his own life by utilizing his Second Amendment right.  I have a bunch of videos, and I'll have a link above.  that'll be the playlist of those videos.  Watch them.  A lot of great information.  It'll get you up to speed.  So what are the updates?  Number one, we know that his bond was set.  It's a $2 million cash bond.  And I'm going to read you some quotes here from that hearing.  It's disturbing, to say the least.  But what I want to say first and foremost is here in America, We have the right to a due process and during that process, we in America are innocent until proven guilty.  Now Kyle has not been proven guilty, yet the media has already vilified him and many politicians have demonized him.  And if you look at any footage, no matter which angle someone was holding their phone up, This kid saved his own life by utilizing his Second Amendment right.  It is, at least for me, my personal opinion, if he did not choose to utilize a firearm, he would not be alive today.  So let's get into it.  Kyle's criminal attorney, his name is Mark Richards, and he asked the court to set the bond at about $750,000 for a couple reasons.  He's 17 years old, he's never done anything wrong, he lives about 10 miles away.  He's no risk to anybody.  In fact, many of us would think that he would be at risk because, you know, those peaceful protesters.  Now Kenosha's assistant district attorney, his name is Thomas Binger, he asked the court to set the bond at two million dollars and I'm gonna read you his quotes, and it's ridiculous.  Don't forget, many Democrat-controlled areas of this country now, they've gone to that no-bond system.  So you could be a hardcore criminal, rape or rob somebody, get released that same day because you're not gonna be held for bond, and then go out and kill somebody, and it has happened.  Here we have a 17-year-old kid who's never done anything wrong.  In fact, up until this fateful day, many considered him an upstanding citizen because of all the stuff he's done to help people.  But I will say is that the other person who was pointing a Glock at Kyle has not been charged at all.  Really?  So the kid who saves his own life gets charged, but one of the guys who was looking to cause harm to him haven't been charged.  Keep that in mind.  And now let's talk about the comments of the Assistant District Attorney here, Thomas Binger.  So Binger said that he believes that Kyle Rittenhouse is a flight risk.  Where is this kid gonna go?  There isn't anybody in the nation who doesn't know who he is or would be able to find him if he ever decided to run, which he won't.  We take people who are illegal coming into the country and let them go for years and never chase them down.  But this kid, who is well within his rights, We just want to lock him up forever.  Until it's court date.  Makes sense, right?  I also want to give you this quote from Binger.  He said, if he is convicted of these charges.  A substantial amount of cash bail is necessary because someone who's facing these types of charges has the strongest possible incentive not to return to court.  Again, where is he gonna go?  It's not like he's moving to San Diego and throw some shades on and grow a mustache like Whitey Bulger.  I mean, this kid is well known right now.  Binger also added that he's not from Wisconsin, yeah, he lives 10 miles away in Illinois, and the fact that his attorney had already fought the extradition.  He said that, quote, I take that all to me.  and the defendant doesn't want to be here.  And if released, he won't come back.  Yeah, he doesn't want to be there because, A, he's in jail.  He doesn't want to be there.  Who wants to be in jail?  And number two, he doesn't live in Kenosha, Wisconsin.  Why would he want to hang around?  I mean, who would want to stick around and hang around in a town that is going out of their way to circumvent the Constitution and violate his rights before the jury trial?  Now, in response to all this, Kyle Rittenhouse, the Kenosha kid, his attorney said that, Your Honor, my client attempted to turn himself in to police that night, but they didn't do anything.  You'll remember the video of Kyle walking to the police cars and them not getting out and doing anything.  which is really helping all that violence.  So he tried, then he went home and turned himself in there.  So Kyle's due back in court on December 3rd for a preliminary hearing.  And if you're interested in ways to help Kyle, you can head over to fightback.law.  I'll have a link down below.  I know that's where his attorney team is basically rallying the cause to support him.  And let's talk about the second issue that has come up.  This came up today actually regarding Kyle's situation around this shooting and what I'm about to talk to you about is criminal in nature.  However, it's not Kyle right now that is facing this issue.  another gentleman His friend actually was just charged for a straw purchase.  Let me tell you more about it.  Dominic Black, a 19-year-old, has been charged with purchasing the weapon that Kyle used that night in Kenosha and purchasing it for Kyle.  According to the criminal complaint that was filed, Black purchased a Smith & Wesson M&P 15 rifle, and it's alleging, alleging again, innocent until proven guilty, it's being alleged that Black purchased this rifle with money given to him from Kyle Rittenhouse.  Now this was done with the intention allegedly of Black giving that rifle to Kyle Rittenhouse who was 17 at the time and thus could not legally purchase a gun in Wisconsin.  Now again allegedly Rittenhouse and Black agreed that the firearm would be kept in Black's stepfather's residence which was in Kenosha and it was the address that was matched on the criminal complaint for Black.  Now, if convicted on this straw purchase, Black is facing up to 12 years in prison, and don't forget that Kyle is facing life in prison for defending himself.  Remember, guys and gals, this could happen to anybody here.  Anybody watching this video could go out tonight and have some type of peaceful protest turned into a violent riot, and you might have to utilize your firearm to protect yourself your wife, your child, your mom, your neighbor, or even somebody else was being attacked.
