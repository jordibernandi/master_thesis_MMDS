I mean, she's like I said, she's deeply indoctrinated.  So let's try to be a little kind to her because, I mean, I feel like she's either in maybe in, I don't know, maybe early college, maybe right out of high school.  I'm not sure.

They didn't notice him at all.  What did we get?  The best that we get is Paul talking about a vision.  And then if you fast forward a little bit, you've got like Tacitus and Pliny the Elder who are really just talking about Christians existing in like the 60s and in the second century.  So you don't really have a lot of solid evidence that there was an actual Jesus.

It depends on how many women came to the tomb.  It depends on how many angels were there, how the angels appeared.

You've got to be part of their religion.  But to be an apostle or whatnot, you had to experience the risen Jesus.  And actually, they just say that they saw the risen Jesus in that particular verse in Paul's 1 Corinthians.  So your assumption here that they physically saw Jesus walking on the ground, no, they experienced Jesus.  They saw Jesus as like a vision.

Like, there are people that are considered secular Christians out there.  Well, I don't understand why they consider themselves secular Christians, but they don't believe in a supernatural kind of Jesus.  It's more of a spiritual thing, as like a moral life guide or something like that, that these tales represent.  And I'm perfectly fine with people taking them like that.  But, see, the problem is that people use this whole Jesus resurrected from the dead.  so you must bow down and suck that Jesus dick as a reason to, like, restrict women from getting abortions or restrict women's rights or restrict atheists in daily life or restrict homosexual people from getting a birthday cake or some kind of shit or wedding cake, whatever the fuck.  They use the resurrection of Jesus in order to say those things you cannot do because some Jew on a stick supposedly resurrected three days later.  that makes no sense and has no historical evidence to support it.  That's why I have a problem with it. ",

And that Bible has been edited and constructed over time to tell the theological story that it wants to tell.  So, you can't trust what the Bible says.  Now, Paul, his writings are in the Bible, but I would say that Paul is the earliest attestation to Jesus, but he's also the only independent attestation to Jesus.  And even then, it's just a vision.
