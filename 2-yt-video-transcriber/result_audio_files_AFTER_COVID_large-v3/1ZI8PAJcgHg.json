But, Cody, why do so many people hate me?  Because Mr.  Maskey, even though there's a global pandemic, our government doesn't care if we live or die and wearing masks has become a partisan issue.  So some people would rather give everyone's grandma COVID to own the libs than to be cucked by a piece of fabric that can save lives.  Oh, well, that's stupid.  It sure is Mr.  Maskey.  Now you go get on someone's face and save some lives while I talk about that.  Well, in these trying times, we are desperately looking for some responsible leadership.  As it turns out, Trump, the guy who called Mexicans rapists and put children in cages, actually doesn't care that much about what happens to people in a pandemic.  We have tested almost 40 million people. ",

            "text": "The Lincoln Project describes themselves thusly.  The founders of the Lincoln Project have spent over 200 years electing Republicans, but now they've sparked a nationwide movement with a singular mission, to defeat Donald Trump and Trumpism.  Now, given that the Lincoln Project was founded in 2019 by people who were alive in 2019, they're apparently time traveling Republicans too.  Like obviously they meant collectively, they've been doing it for like 200 years if you add them all together, but like, come on guys, like, what are you like, give me a break, okay.  I don't wanna look a gift Lincoln in the mouth.  Trump is a monster who might destroy us all.  Ha ha ha ha.  And if the Lincoln Project wants to spend a chunk of money on ads against him, who am I to clutch my lefty pearls?  It's a good thing if they're able to convince some Republicans to not vote for Trump or even to vote against him.  Besides, the Lincoln Project has some pretty decent positions, like that.  it's bad for the government to kidnap people off the streets using jackbooted thugs, and that we shouldn't be killing people with COVID.  They've called Mitch McConnell out for being a vaguely human-shaped slug monster.  They've made cool boner jokes, and they've praised Ronald Reagan, citing him as an inspiration for their work, and thanked George W. Bush for the bare minimum in anti-racism.  So, ha, but wait, what?  These hip and cool Republicans 2.0 still revere?  Ronald trickled down tax cuts for the wealthy apartheid South Africans supporting racist, dog whistling murderers, contra funding Reagan?  And George blood soaked war in Iraq and Afghanistan that killed at least half a million people.  that was all based on a lie, Bush?  Well, Maybe the folks running the Lincoln Project are some good-hearted conservatives who simply don't know any better, who missed the memo about the nearly decades-long wars in the Middle East, all the torture we did.  We should probably let the Lincoln Project know that their heroes did a few mass murderous uh-oh whoopsie daisies.  I'm sure they'd be shocked to hear it.  Let's talk to Ben Howell, the Lincoln Project's video whiz.  I'm sure he'll be upset to hear about all the murders and stuff.  Ben?  Oh, well, okay.  Well, here he is coming in with the pro-murder hot take in 2014.  Sorry, pro-self-defense hot take.  after he tweeted referring to the police shooting of an unarmed black man in Ferguson.  Give me a gun.  Put me in Darren Wilson's shoes.  I'd have shot Mike Brown right in his face.  I said black man, he's a kid, shot a kid dead anyway.  Well, he doesn't speak for the whole organization and they kicked him out when old tweets where he called people the C word came out.  So let's talk to one of the Lincoln Project's prominent founders, Steve Schmidt.  Steve.  Guess what, bud?  The Lincoln Project tweeted out, Dick Cheney, welcome to the resistance, just because he wears a face mask.  But Steve, did you know that Dick Cheney was the architect of an illegal war that killed at least half a million people and lied about torture being effective so he could keep torturing people?  Oh, silly me, you probably do know that because you're that Steve Schmidt, the guy who worked for Cheney as deputy assistant to President George W. Bush and counselor to Vice President Cheney and helped run their reelection campaign.  Any good hits from Rick Wilson, also of the Lincoln Project and lifelong Republican operative paid to lie about and attack the party he is currently trying to influence?  Oh, lots of them?  Hmm.  Hmm.  Cool, so these are the very thoughtful, good decision makers involved with the Lincoln Project.  Now, I might be accused of purity testing or thinking that just because they supported previous criminal presidents doesn't mean we shouldn't be thankful they don't support this criminal president.  But actually, I am thankful they're coming out against Trump.  I think it's swell.  I hope their ads help beat Trump in November.  I hope Trump himself after losing on national TV and that he's held accountable for at least one of his many, many crimes and maybe gets put in jail for, you know, all his fascist hobbies and how his negligence in the face of the coronavirus pandemic has killed over 100,000 people in the US.  Maybe we can do that.  That'd be, that'd be cool.  But after that, I hope we never hear from the Lincoln Project again, because their morals seem to amount to, we support murderous presidents, but we like polite folksy ones.  And for them to kill people in other countries, not in America itself.  Come on, folks, get on board with the project.  But, you know that that's not going to be the case.  The Lincoln Project and all the never Trump conservatives won't just meekly accept that their brand of republicanism is actually what created Donald Trump.  They won't sheepishly fade into the background, suddenly realizing the follies of their ways.  In fact, they'll just use their new position of being friendly with the Democrats and the resistance to try to push them further to the right.  In fact, they've been getting a lot of positive attention from the liberal resistance, like from MSNBC.  Here's a montage by the Colbert Report in a real chill interview they had with Lincoln Project's Rick Wilson.  I don't give money to political organizations.  I've given money to the Lincoln Project because of ads like this. ",

That Never Trumpers are increasingly involved in the Democratic Party and have gradually shifted their tactics in that direction.  effectively becoming a Never Trump and Never Bernie Sanders coalition.  And they appear to be having more success shaping their new party than the one that many of them had been associated with for much of their lives.  According to the analysis, Never Trump.  conservatives have entrenched themselves in the Democratic Party by becoming overrepresented in the media, by allying with centrist Democrats, and by forming a faction in the Democrats.
