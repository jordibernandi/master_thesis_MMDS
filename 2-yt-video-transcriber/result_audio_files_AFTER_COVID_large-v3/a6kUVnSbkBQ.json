            "text": "so this is absolutely crazy.  so with all the covid stuff going on all the different countries are basically sort of given their own policies that they have in terms of their borders and whatnot.  now norway the ntnu the norwegian university of science and technology roasted the life out of the united states of america.  honestly this is a burn that's going to be.  you know It's going to hurt a lot.  It's really going to hurt a lot.  So here's a message that they shared on Facebook.  It says in accordance with recommendations from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and NTNU strongly recommends that all NTNU students who are outside Norway return home.  This applies especially.  If you are staying in a country with poorly developed health services and infrastructure and or collective infrastructure, for example, the USA, the same applies if you do not have health insurance.  Ouch, man.  And when I first saw this, I was like, this is too good to be true.  It's fake.  I went to the NTNU Facebook page and I looked at the post and I didn't see it.  I was like, oh, it's fake.  This is too good to be true.  But no, it turns out they actually edited the post to take it out.  They decided to edit the post to remove it.  But this actually was the original message.  And also, if you go to the NTNU website, NTNU.edu, They still have it up on here where it says this applies especially if you're staying in a country with poorly developed health services.  This also applies for countries with poorly developed collective infrastructure.  For example, the USA where it can be difficult to get transport to the airport if you don't have a car.  so what's crazy is you know we're getting double roasted.  dude.  we're getting roasted for our health care system and then also our public infrastructure.  in terms of transport you know we don't have high-speed rail for whatever reason.  we're the only like country that doesn't seem to focus on that.  you know public transit is supposed to be a huge huge thing especially when it comes to lowering emissions you know due to less people driving cars for whatever reason i remember even when i was like a little kid man I was like four or five.  I remember they're supposed to be, you know, by like 2010 or something like that.  They were going to have a train that can go from SF to LA.  Looks like, you know, that didn't end up happening.  That whole big rail thing didn't end up happening, which is sad.  I don't know why, but... You're getting double-roasted, and honestly, I'm glad this happened.  I wish they kept a Facebook post up like that, because... And it just makes it funny, because remember when Trump was talking about the shithole countries, and he was like, oh, why don't we get people from countries like Norway?  It's because we are the shithole country.  Norway has all these systems, you know, strong infrastructure, transportational infrastructure, public infrastructure, and then also, you know, in terms of healthcare, they have healthcare universal system, so... What you're talking about is you're talking about you're getting roasted, and so you need to step your game up, right?  All the so-called American exceptionalists, America number one, all this stuff.  I love to suck America's cock, and I shove the USA flag up my bum hole every night before I go to sleep, and then, you know, I do it while I listen to the National Anthem.  All that garbage, right?  Which means nothing.  All of it means nothing, alright?  Literally nothing.  Meanwhile, you have a garbage healthcare system and a public transportation infrastructure system that's getting clowned on by Norway.  If you really want to be as good as Norway, alright?  A small country, you want to be as good as they are.  You need to step your game up, alright?  Step your game up, alright?  Step your game up, alright?  Get universal healthcare.  Have high-speed rail like every other major nation does.  China, Germany.  Have serious infrastructure.  Have actual universal healthcare.  Okay, that's what you need to do here.  Because this is just not a good look for us.  But man, what a harsh burn that was from Norway.  Oh, it's going to take a while to recover from that one.  Ouch! ",
