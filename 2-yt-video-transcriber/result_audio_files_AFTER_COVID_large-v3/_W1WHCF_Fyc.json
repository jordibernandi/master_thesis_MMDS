            "text": "What's up skeptics, Thomas Westbrook here.  Can the stories in the Bible be taken literally as natural historic accounts, or are there problems that arise when interpreting Christian scripture this way?  Unless you see the Bible as pure metaphor or allegory, you can approach the Bible, or any religious text for that matter, in several of the following ways.  On one end of the spectrum, you can take the stories as pure myth, complete and total fiction without a shred of truth in them.  Then you can approach them as legend, where some but not all of the people, places, and events described are based loosely in reality before being exaggerated and embellished over time, resulting in a grand, largely non-historical big fish fantasy.  On the other side of this truth spectrum, you have the Bible as a true human interpretation of completely natural historical events.  An example of that would be saying that the Red Sea did part during the Exodus story, but it was the result of completely natural strong winds and just the right placement of a land bridge right below the surface of the water.  It may not have been like the classic movie, The Ten Commandments. ",

Some atheists even take this approach, trying to find natural explanations for the scriptural accounts, without necessarily realizing that the stories themselves aren't exactly the most credibly sourced and are oftentimes riddled with scientific impossibilities, historic inaccuracies, and contradictions.  Creationist organizations like Answers in Genesis or Catholic Answers will also typically take this approach as long as they can until they hit a wall of impossibilities and have to swing further down the spectrum to interpreting the Bible as true by appealing to the supernatural.  happened as described, and if something is scientifically impossible, like a talking donkey or a man living in a fish belly for three days, rather than raising a skeptical eyebrow at the story in question like they would do to any other religion or to Greek or Norse mythology, instead they throw out everything that science has repeatedly tested and demonstrated about the universe we live in, and they embrace the world of the impossible, miracles and all.  This is an unfalsifiable cop-out.  There's no evidence for a global flood?  Well, God must have hid the evidence to test your faith.  Prove me wrong!  And in making this leap, they simultaneously shift the burden of proof and violate Occam's razor.  But do Christians have to completely throw science, reason, and logic out the window and appeal to miracles if they want to accept the Bible as historically true?  Or can they hang around here, on the spectrum of the Bible as a natural historical reality?  Catholic apologist Trent Horn with Catholic Answers has been attempting to rebut my videos on the historicity of the Bible, and I've been defending my work.  I'll link to my last two videos below.  In my video on Joshua, I showed how a hailstorm slaughtering tens of thousands of soldiers, as told in the Bible, was absolutely preposterous.  I showed that while it's possible, just how unlikely it is to actually die from hail.  What I didn't include was the fact that the Guinness Book of World Records puts the deadliest hailstorm in history at... 246 people. ",

Noah keeps record of hail fatalities since the year 2000.  Only four people have been killed by hail.  So he said he got it from AccuWeather, and if this is the article he got it from... I'm baffled because this is the paragraph before it in that same article.  And it says, the World Meteorological Organization reported that the highest mortality associated with a hailstorm, a modern hailstorm, happened near Morabad, India on April 30th, 1888.  The deadly storm killed 246 people with pieces of hail as large as goose eggs, oranges, and cricket balls.  So that's on par with what's being described happening to the Amorites here in this section of Joshua.  So I just, I don't get it how he would quote this here, but then completely gloss over this here. ",

            "text": "Trent, this account from Muradabad, India actually was in the first draft of my script.  But the reason I didn't include it in my final draft is simple.  I fact checked it.  And you should have too.  You see, I wanted to know if it was even possible for an entire army of tens or hundreds of thousands to be wiped out by hailstones as reported in the biblical book of Joshua.  What I found was report after report of massive, record-breaking hailstorms everywhere from the US to Israel to Australia with no deaths.  And when there were fatalities, they were almost always from lightning strikes, wind knocking houses down on people, or flash floods accompanying the storms.  Even with over 100,000 major hailstorms in the US in the last 20 years, there were only 4 reported deaths from hail.  That alone raised some serious red flags for me with this 132 year old account from rural India.  So I tracked down the source.  According to Arizona State University, the London Times reported about half the number reported by AccuWeather.  150 deaths caused chiefly by hailstones.  so not even all of the 150.  But they also included what they referred to as one of the earliest and most complete references to this event, which was given by A.W.  Greeley in his 1888 book, American Weather.  He got the story third hand from a John Elliott who got it from a J.S.  Macintosh, Greeley wrote that about 230 people died in Muradabad, and the majority of the deaths were caused by hail.  The majority of them.  So not quite 246 hail deaths in Muradabad, but most likely more than half of the 230 deaths in this town were recorded as hail-related.  But see, I wasn't done.  I tracked down the original book, and the very next paragraph states that Greeley's source, John Elliot, was, quote, \"...of the opinion that those who perished were not killed directly by the blows of the hailstones, but by being knocked down by the wind, were buried in the hail and perished through the combined effects of cold and  exhaustion.\".  So the reason I cited meticulously detailed statistics spanning decades from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and didn't go with a sketchy third-hand 132-year-old account from Marathabad, India, is because I went with the far more reliable source.

But we'll come back to that.  The fact is, I don't just have to cite the NOAA to make my case.  Let's assume for a moment that the world record of 246 fatalities in India is actually accurate.  It still decimates the biblical account.  You see, in the last 132 years, there have been millions of hailstorms around the world.  5,396 major hailstorms in just the US in 2019 alone, which is about an average year for the US.  That's one year, one country, do the math.  Even the most damaging hailstorm, very, very rarely results in a single fatality.  And when they do, it's usually from strong winds collapsing buildings on someone or someone being caught in a flash flood or being struck by lightning.  India is the second biggest country in the world in terms of population and is extremely densely populated.  Even with millions of storms spanning over a century, it is very difficult to find more than a handful of hailstorms where more than a few dozen people died from hail.  Heck, with the three that he found, Trent listed most of them.  The Muradabad India storm happened here, and the Roopkund Lake incident happened here in the Himalayan mountains, where some of the most extreme weather in the world occurs.  One of the other biggest death tolls happened here in Bangladesh, but it didn't even break a hundred fatalities.  Finally, hail falls significantly harder at high altitude places like the Himalayas because the air is thinner, offering less air resistance than somewhere at sea level like the nation of Israel. ",

            "text": "8% more damaging, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Paul Schlatter.  So with millions of hailstorms to choose from, the world record for the most people killed by hail in extremely population-dense India, with some of the most dangerous weather in the world, is a whopping 246.  Maybe.  And oftentimes these numbers include those killed by lightning, drowning in flash floods, cotton collapsing buildings, et cetera.  And bear in mind that while not always, it's oftentimes children and the elderly who die in storms like this.  and not battle-hardened, thicker-boned adult men wearing helmets and shields.  Okay, by comparison, how many soldiers does the Bible claim died from hail in the battle against Joshua?  It doesn't.  But we can get some high and low estimates.  Israel had over 600,000 fighting men.  At least 40,000 of them crossed into Canaan with Joshua, where he joined up with another army.  Even if the army that he joined up with had a quarter of the men that he had, that would give him about 50,000 or so troops.  In Canaan, there were seven nations more populous and mightier than Israel according to Deuteronomy 7.  Five armies in Canaan rose up to squash Israel.  It is highly unlikely that five armies from nations stronger than Israel would go toe-to-toe against them without bringing at least the same number of troops to the table.  But given that the Bible paints the odds as daunting and depicts Israel as needing miracles from God for a victory, they probably had well over 50,000 troops, and that's low-balling the number, assuming Joshua didn't bring the rest of his 600,000 fighting men along.  Now, I'm not saying that these numbers are realistic, but we're going with what the Bible says took place.  According to Joshua 10, the enemy army was wiped out, and more than half of them died from hail.  So, an extreme low-ball of the number would be 25,000 armed men, possibly as many as 300,000 or more armed with shields and wearing helmets, who died from hail in Israel.  Let me repeat that.  The world record for hail deaths in one of the most population-dense places on planet Earth with the most extreme weather on the planet is 230 or 246, possibly.  And that's over 100 times smaller than the lowest estimate that we can possibly derive from this Bible passage. ",

And people wonder, well, what caused all of these people to die?  Well, here's the story from Atlas Obscura.  It says that among Himalayan women, there is an ancient and traditional folk song.  The lyrics describe a goddess so enraged at outsiders who defiled her mountain sanctuary that she rained death upon them by flinging hailstones hard as iron.  After much research and consideration, a 2004 expedition came to the same conclusion.  All 200 people died from a sudden and severe hailstorm.  This is dated, I think, to like 850 AD.  Maybe it's BC, but this was several centuries ago.  And these people were all around this lake.  They were caught in a hailstorm.  And they know this because when you look at the skeletons, you see that they suffer things like... skull fractures, but the indentations on the skulls are not caused by any known weapons available at that time.  They're these divots that were caused by being impacted by hailstones.  Now, later research has shown where we come to India, the Skeleton Lake, that some of the skeletons there were not from that catastrophe, but from some other disaster.  But they still say a large number of them were killed in a sudden and freak hailstorm. ",

So a lot of them probably died from skull fractures from these large hailstones.  And hail can weigh as much as two pounds if you get a bad enough hailstorm.  If a block of ice the size of a grapefruit hits your skull, you're not going to be doing so well.  And not even that, even if it's not the hail, you had people who might, in terror, which happened to the Amorites possibly, in terror, run off of cliffs or down gullies, be stampeded by horses or by one another.

None of the oldest accounts I could track down for that actually claimed that a thousand people died from hail.  Instead, there's an account of troops freezing to death because the day was quote, so cold and dark that much of the king's people died.  There's another account of a foul day of mist and hail, and so bitter cold that many men died of cold, wherefore unto this day many men call it Black Monday.  Oh, and as for this being God's intervention on Easter Monday, Easter Monday fell on April 6th in 1360, not April 14th.  So... I'm guessing this account was likely a highly exaggerated slash embellished account by King Edward III, using God's will slash intervention as an excuse to withdraw from a failing military campaign while saving face.  Because that's exactly what he did.  So in nearly 700 years with millions upon millions of hailstorms, we have one baloney miracle account of a thousand troops dying by divine intervention, and we have a handful of instances where a hundred or two died in a hailstorm.  I'm not saying that nobody has ever died from hail.  If you're caught in a hail storm, seek shelter.  But the Bible's account of tens, possibly hundreds of thousands of soldiers in armor dying from hail at sea level in the Middle East has my BS detectors going crazy right now. ",
