            "text": "As it turns out, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon was the first self-declared anarchist.  He wrote What is Property in 1840.  He was a wide-ranging and difficult writer.  He wasn't a system-builder.  He was critical of utopianisms and he was fascinated with contradictions.  For Proudhon, the ideal society was a contractual one, where individuals are free to arrange their relationships under conditions of justice.  But for justice to flourish, its laws had to be known to all.  To understand his theory of property then, it's important to start with his idea of justice.  He wrote, \"...justice is the central star which governs society, the pole around which the political world revolves, the principle and regulator of all transactions.  Nothing takes place between men save in the name of right, nothing without the invocation of  justice.\".  Justice, nothing else, that is the Alpha and Omega of my argument.  A human interaction is guided by laws which are the product of calculations, feelings or facts about what we perceive to be right.  We live, in other words, by socialised rules.  We queue, we say thank you, we pay tax, we drive on one side of the road, we have the right of free speech up to the point of causing disturbances.  These rules are the rules of justice.  They are intended to make us all freer in the long term.  one of those rules is property.  we can own stuff it's ours exclusively.  but proudhon asks what if property was a miscalculation a misunderstanding of the moral law a mistake that we've been paying for ever since an original sin that has led to many of our problems.

So what's the justification, and note just at the beginning of justification here, for property?  Well, philosophical justifications for property usually come in two types.  Arguments for occupation and arguments for labour.  We'll start, as Proudhon does, with occupation.  he writes the right of occupation or of the first occupant is that which results from the actual physical real possession of a thing.  i occupy a piece of land and the presumption is that i and the proprietor until the contrary is proved.  In a state of nature, I stumbled across some land with an apple tree on, for example, and put up a fence and occupy.  So the land is my property.  But, Proudhon argues, if this is the case, occupation is simply toleration.  In other words, it requires the consent of others.  It must be mutual.  If it's a right, it must be reciprocal.  The theater, says Cicero, is common to all.  The occupation argument implies equality.  He says that thine and mine are signs and expressions of personal but equal rights.  In other words, the right to occupy is equal to all.  The earth is given to us all in common to sustain us.  So portioning it up must wrong no one.  This, of course, has important repercussions today when much of the land is already divided. ",

What will become of them, having an instrument with which to work, but no material to work upon?  Each man needs to occupy some area to live, some material to work with.  If a hundred thousand men settle on an island with no inhabitants, does each not have a right to one one-hundredth of the land?  He writes, Not only does occupation lead to equality, it prevents property, for since every man, from the fact of his existence, has the right of occupation, and in order to live must have material for cultivation on which he may labour, and since, on the other hand, the number of occupants varies continually with the births and deaths, consequently occupation is always subordinate to population.

Comte said that, if a man should be deprived of air for a few moments only, he would cease to exist, and a partial deprivation would cause him severe suffering.  A partial or complete deprivation of food would produce like effects upon him.  Man needs light from the stars, Earth's atmosphere, fresh water, and of course, land. ",

Proudhon now turns to those that have argued that property is justified by labour.  John Locke's theory of property is the most well known of these.  He said that a person has a right to an object as property when they have laboured upon it.  Without this right, how could people live after all? ",

Or does the farmer have a right to the field because he tills it?  Well, as we've seen with occupancy, the answer is no.  So while the farmer and the fisherman might have a right to the product of their labour, they do not make property of the means to that product.

But none of these titles confer upon me the right of property.  For if I attempt to base it upon occupancy, society can reply, I am the original occupant.  If I appeal to my labour, it will say, it is only on that condition that you possess.  From these two lines of criticisms, labour and occupation, Proudhon has ultimately argued that all possession has a dual nature, a part that is ours by virtue of needing it for the flourishing of our own liberty, and a part that is societies who have contributed to its value and still has a right to it based on need and occupation.  Another way of summing this up might be to say that everything is only really borrowed.  ultimately his theory of property can be summed up by his phrase the right to product is exclusive.  deus in re the right to means is common deus ad rem.  proudhon is one of the most important figures in the history of socialist and radical thought.
