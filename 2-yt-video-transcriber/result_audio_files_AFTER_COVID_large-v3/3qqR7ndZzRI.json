            "text": "This is a bit of a tough question, so let me try to layer some wisdom, I hope, into the answer that I give.  On one end, they have a lot of songs that I think are great, and I can sing with my whole heart, and I appreciate and love.  On the other hand, there's some songs that are questionable, and I kind of take those on a song-by-song basis.  Other ones where you're like, wait a minute, what?  I can't say this.  I just can't say this.  This doesn't seem right.  But there's another concern, a whole different concern with Bethel's music, and that has to do with how it's being leveraged by the movement to promote their teachings.  Right.  They really want to change the church more so than the world, I think.  And they're trying to change the way churches do things, and I think in unbiblical ways.  The way they use the music for this is in two different ways.  One, they will put lyrics in the songs that promote their particular understanding of healing and prophecy and God speaking and doing miracles in the world.  They'll also gather people together for conferences and events using the music as the reason to gather.  And then they will teach them their new theology and their new methodology for how churches to be done.  And so this has been explicitly stated by the leaders.  They say, we're using the music as a vehicle of getting our teaching and methodology into churches.  That we should take knowledge of.  And we should just be like, yeah, you know, When vineyard music didn't do that, you know what I mean?  Like other popular Christian music movements never did that.  This is something new and different.  Intentional. ",

I too have been very encouraged by a lot of the music.  I think they have amazing musicians and vocalists.  As a pastor, I would have a lot of people bring up concerns about certain songs, and I think we're right to take a look at that.  So thank you, bro. ",
