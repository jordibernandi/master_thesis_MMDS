So this was the guy that got some statues taken down for him and stuff.  He was a Civil War general for the Confederacy.  He was from Virginia, and he decided to \u2013.  People were very, very loyal to their states, especially because, you know, 1776, actually 1765, 66, somewhere in there, the Articles of Confederation happened, and the states were literally kind of their own countries.  A lot of people don't really realize this.  Each state in the inception of America, the first run we had, before the Constitution of the United States, there was a period of time.  Actually, 1776 was the Declaration of Independence, right?  Not the Constitution.  Anyway, it doesn't matter.  For 10 years, we had the Articles of Confederation.  I should look that up real quick to refresh.  Articles of Confederation.  What's the date on those?  1781.  That's what it is.  So, 1776, got independent.  1781, for about ten years, that happened.  Well, I guess more like eight years, but still.  Articles of Confederation, trash.  Just think about it like this.  We're a confederation of states, okay?  So, sort of.  It was shit, though.  It was sort of libertarian.  There was, like, different... And they had to be unanimous on decisions, which of course, imagine making a unanimous decision ever with humans involved.  It was really, really terrible.  But after that, people were still highly loyal to... to their states.  And Robert E. Lee was born in, what, 1807, it seems.  And so he was raised by a generation of people that were supremely loyal to their state.  So when Virginia went off to do Civil War shit during the Civil War, well, he went with Virginia instead of the United States.  So he was a Confederate soldier.  General, and I want you to... This is the... There are reasons that you could be like, you know what, Robert E. Lee, even though he was on the wrong side of history, he was on the wrong side of history, you could say, hey, maybe he had some little nuggets here and there where you could see a little positivity.  He certainly wasn't Hitler, you know what I mean?  He wasn't the worst guy in the world, but he certainly wasn't fucking good.  It's Robert fucking E. Lee.  Anyway... It's just beautiful.  It's just beautiful.  What a gift.  What a gift this was.  What a gift.  I'm so ready.  There's a statue.  Remember that one that got taken down? ",
