Say, wear a mask if you want to.  You can wear it when you drive.  You can act like your mask will save the whole world, leaving common sense behind.  Mask.  Vaccine.  Not for me.  You can go where you want to, because masks are normalized.  They react and attack when they don't see a mask, and their timbers start to rise.  You can mask if you want to, though you're healthy and so am I. You can wear PPE from your head to your feet, but the virus will survive.  Say, wear a mask, wear a mask, Rona is out of control.  Wear a mask, wear a mask, doing it for the lulz.  Wear a mask, wear a mask, showing everyone you comply.  Wear a mask, wear a mask, everybody's wearing a mask.  Your safety mask, need a safety mask.  Oh, safety mask, get a safety mask.  C-19.  Wear the mask if you want to, my immune system is fine.  Even if you reuse it every day and never lose it, the odds are you'll be just fine.  Put on the mask if you want to, but don't ask me where is mine.  Cause I don't wear a mask and since I don't mask, just stay six feet behind.  Wear the mask, wear the mask, symbolize your control.  Wear the mask, wear the mask, regurgitate what you're told.  Wear the mask, wear the mask, put a piece of cloth on your face.  Wear the mask, wear the mask, savior of the whole human race.  It's a safety mask, a safety mask.  Safety mask, my safety mask.  Oh, safety mask, my safety mask.  Thank you. ",
