It's got several of them.  They're worthy of watching and he, uh, stays calm.  I always liked that.  It's on the stays calm and thinks about what he's doing.  He's at the Manchester Police Department, videoing from the sidewalk, not on their property at all, runs across a female cop that just doesn't get it.  No matter how many times he says, I'm not answering your questions, I'm not giving my ID, she won't stop, just won't stop.  And we see this all the time.  And this male cop comes up.  He's pretty cool at first.  Let's just go ahead with the video. ",

Am I being detained?  At the moment, yes.  It's a very simple question.  Right now, you're being detained.  We're talking to you.  Can you call a supervisor, please?  Not at the moment.  Yes, you can.  You're illegally detaining me for absolutely no crime, and you can't even articulate it.  So give me a supervisor.  We're talking to you.  Give me a supervisor, please.

It's not the smartest thing to do because there's a lot of cops out there that the minute you do that, they will use that as an excuse to beat the hell out of you.  So it's probably not the best thing to do.  But he got away with it this time.  And I'm wondering if he has like a tattoo, a flag tattoo or something, and she's going to use that to call and try to identify him or something.  I don't know.  But anyway, he does a pretty good job.  So if y'all, I will leave a link in the description to his website.  video his channel and y'all can go check him out and subscribe if y'all see fit.  and this is pnp news we are out of here.  y'all have a good day.
