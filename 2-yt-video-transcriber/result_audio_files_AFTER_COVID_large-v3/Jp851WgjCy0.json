            "text": "Oh, hi there.  Welcome to Facts About Men.  And if you agree, make sure to share so the people are aware of the facts.  Thank you.  Let's get into it.  Men are obsessed with achievement because they use it as a dick swinging contest and they use it to control women and blah, blah, blah.  No.  No, you know why men are so driven towards achievement and success?  It's because nobody else gives a fuck about them.  That's how they feel.  Let's be honest here.  The closest that men get in society to cared about or valued is whether or not they're deemed as useful.  The implicit stigma and pressure of being the provider only allows for them not being loved for who they are, but what they can do.  And that's perpetuated onto men right from little boys.  Men is that they inherit value.  No, I don't think so.  I think that women and children are valued simply because they're women and children.  And again, men are valued based off of what they can do and what they can provide.  why men feel so worthless?  because the transition from boyhood to adulthood is incredibly difficult because they literally go from valued to only valued again based off of what they can do.  they're no longer loved and cared for based off of just who they are and so they inherit the feeling of worthlessness.  And they will continue to carry the feeling of worthlessness until they feel like they have proved their value, proved what they can do, proved what they can provide.  And before they can, nobody cares.  Myth.  Myth.  men are valued just because they're men, whereas women have to work harder for it.  Now, again, I want you to keep in mind, all of these examples are just in the Western world.  But again, that is an absolute myth.  That's not true.  So they kind of inherit their value, whereas men have to create theirs.  And that's a. There's no way an upper class businessman can be oppressed because success is a lifestyle choice.  No, it's actually not.  Fact, success is pretty much life or death for men.  And this ties exactly into my last point.  So to anyone that was like to that one, listen to this.  Women, if they fail in school, we can become mothers.  We can just say, fuck it, stay home, be a mom.  We are automatically valued because we're moms.  We're still, we're carrying life.  We're still doing something.  Men, well, first of all, stay at home.  dads are stigmatized already in society to be losers.  So what does that say?  That says that once men hit below some sort of like, um, expectations societal expectation.  they're no longer even human they're no longer even looked at and they're no longer valued.  I would like to say that this is a huge argument for me when people try to say that the pay gap is just because women are paid less just because they're women.  no I think that men have to fight harder because they have to.  they don't have another choice.  so to every boy teenager, father, man, old man, whether you're married, divorced, single father, co-parenting, whatever you may be, whatever class you fall into in this life, I want you to know that you need to look at society's standards.  and say, go fuck yourself because guess what?  We are never going to fit where we're supposed to.  We are always gonna be picked apart and everything about us is unique and you have something to add to this world.  Don't let anybody tell you otherwise.  Thank you. ",
