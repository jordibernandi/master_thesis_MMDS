            "text": "Just with this quick update, hi guys this is your sister Karen Gidden in Jesus Christ.  I want to give this very very powerful very powerful very powerful revelation.  it's not a vision it's not a dream it is literally a revelation.  it's the Holy Spirit that spoke and told me this beautiful, beautiful information, brothers and sisters, which I didn't know.  So I'm quite excited.  I'm quite happy to share it with my brothers and sisters.  About four weeks ago, About four weeks ago, I was conversating with somebody on Facebook.  And this beautiful beloved, I cannot remember if it's a brother or sister in the Lord, because I think I only spoke to them once or twice.  And this beautiful beloved basically sent me a private message.  And she said to me, well, the person said to me, Sister Carrie Ann, sorry.  The person basically said to me, Sister Karen, you know, could you give us a word about Kenya?  We need a word for Kenya because there are so many things happening in Kenya.  People are unsettled and all of that.  And she said, you know, we know.  the person said, you know, we know that obviously you gave word concerning Congo.  zimbabwe and another part in africa where i just didn't know where i was standing.  and all of that she said is the lord said anything about kenya?  and as i was reading this beloved comment brothers and sisters i could feel i could feel the passion the passion coming through from the comment.  I could feel the passion and just this love that this person have for their country, Kenya.  And as I was reading that in my heart, I was saying, I have no information concerning Kenya because Yah has not given me any visions or dreams.  So I'm not gonna make, I wouldn't make anything up.  That's what I was saying in my heart.  So as I was planning to reply to the person to say, I'm really sorry, I have no information concerning Kenya.  The Lord hasn't said anything to me.  Brothers and sisters, I think because of the desire of this beautiful beloved and the desire touched the most highest heart.  All of a sudden, straight away, I heard the sweet Holy Spirit.  I heard a beautiful, beautiful Holy Spirit begun to speak.  And when he spoke, he said, tell them that Mount Sinai is found in Kenya.  Just like that.  Now, when I heard that in my spirit, brothers and sisters, yeah, I've heard about Mount Sinai.  You know, I know about Mount Sinai.  Moses went up into Mount Sinai and all of that.  Got the Ten Commandments.  I know all of that.  I don't know where it is.  So when the Holy Spirit said that to me, tell them.  that mount sinai is found in kenya.  brothers and sisters i replied back and i basically said to her to the person sorry beloved our holy spirit said to tell you that mount sinai is found in kenya.  and i said what a blessing.  what a grace brothers and sisters in this time we're living in the truth.  The artifacts are coming into fruition.  The truth concerning where all these places are, the Most High is showing his people because this has been a cover-up.  Africa, I heard somebody, I think it was some guy i can't remember who it was.  i was on youtube flicking about and i clicked on the video and i heard some guy says that africa.  no yeah it says that africa is the land of beauty and is the land of unknown riches.  It was coming from a Caucasian guy.  And he said, Africa is a land of beauty and a land of unknown riches, which means that Africa is very rich.  So a lot of people don't know it.  Yes, in the forefront, people think it's very poor, but that's because the wicked elites have covered a lot of things up.  but kenya kenya what a grace.  mount mount sinai.  do you know how?  do you know how important and beautiful that is?  mount sinai is found in your country.  it is found in kenya hallelujah to the lamb of god.  so now we know that solomon's temple.  all right i think that's the house that's solomon's physical house not the temple temple where you know building the temple for the lord but his house.  i believe it's solomon's house.  solomon's temple is found in zimbabwe when the lord showed me that through a vision through the angel Now told me that, you know, Zimbabwe, in Zimbabwe, you will find Solomon's Temple.  Hallelujah.  And then obviously Congo.  Hallelujah.  Congo, which is the belt of truth.  All right.  That's where things started in Congo.  Hallelujah.  And, you know, obviously told me about the Congolese, the Asian Congolese women, that they're very beautiful.  And Congo is a very, very rich country.  Very, very, very rich.  Got the gold and the minerals and all of that.  I did a video concerning that.  And then he showed me another part in Africa where the tribe of Judah and the tribe of Levi is always together.  Always together.  Levi and the tribe of Judah is always together, brothers and sisters.  So now the Most High is telling us that mount sinai mount sinai the holy mountain.  it is found in kenya and i believe it 100. i don't have to read in the textbook i'm not going to research it i'm taking it as face value.  if the holy spirit said it's in kenya it is in kenya and i believe what a grace to you kenya.  What a grace to you, Kenya.  Beautiful, beautiful revelation from the Most High.  Your country is blessed, you know.  Your country is very, very, very, very, very blessed.  Very, very blessed is Kenya.  So I just wanted to come.  And release that information in the midst of the wicked man-made pestilence.  The Lord is still, the Most High is still giving information concerning the beautiful continent, the beautiful continent of Africa.  Hallelujah, hallelujah.  Africa, where it all began.  hallelujah where it all begun hallelujah.  we glorify the Lord for that.  so yes I just wanted to come and release that.  I hope my Kenyan brothers and sisters will be excited about this.  maybe you already know this information.  maybe you know that Mount Sinai is found in Kenya.  I had no idea.  I don't even know where Mount Sinai was.  I know now.  hallelujah glory to your name Lord.  I I know now and I know that it is found in the beautiful country of Kenya.  So God eternally bless you.  I love you all and I'll see you soon.  Someday in glory, in Jesus' precious holy name.  Amen and amen.  Amen.  Blessings.  Amen.  Blessings. ",
