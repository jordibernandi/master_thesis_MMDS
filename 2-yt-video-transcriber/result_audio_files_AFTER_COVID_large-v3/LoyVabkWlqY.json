            "text": "Hey guys, Bix Weir, Road to Root.com.  Let's talk derivatives.  Oil derivative market is getting destroyed, as in counterparties are falling left and right.  This was part of the original Road to Root documents that came out of the Fed on January 1st, 2007, that I was there.  There's the Road to Root comic book called Wishes and Rainbows, Road to Root Teacher's Guide called The Road to Root, And there was a pamphlet called Banking Basics that talked about why banks fail.  And it talked about this bank called Gusher National Bank.  I'll get to that in a second.  But as we see, oil prices are plunging.  There's a massive oversupply and no place to store it, which is costing people who hold oil huge amounts of money to store.  And there's no room.  So what do you do?  You got to go negative.  Pay people to take it off your hands.  Unbelievable.  Oil plunges below $5 a barrel with traders fleeing expiring contract.  This is all a criminal derivative game.  This is a criminal derivative game.  Oil and gas derivatives have nothing to do with the price, just like gold and silver have nothing to do with price.  But we're talking billions, if not trillions, in the derivative market that are going to get destroyed.  If you have long derivative contracts and you are facing just the ultimate in nuclear financial explosion.  right now, right now, you're going to see some of the biggest banks in the world crumble on Tuesday when these contracts expire.  U.S.  futures fall to lowest trading since trading began.  CME says it's possible.  May WTI contract can trade negative.  Like I said, just like gold and silver, you can have negative \u2013 they can set the price to zero and it trades negative because you have to store the gold and silver.  It's all fake though.  It's all derivative contracts, nothing to do with the real underlying thing.  Although in oil's case, yeah, there's nobody \u2013 they're pumping oil like mad and there's nobody to use it, nobody to take it on lockdown.  This is really ugly when you look at how big the oil and gas derivative market is, which is one of the biggest, if not the biggest, it's definitely the biggest commodity derivative.  Now, I think the derivatives on foreign exchanges and stuff like that, I mean, it's all electronic anyway, but even there's no underlying physical asset.  Whereas in oil, they are by far the largest oil market.  The oil derivative market is much bigger than gold, silver, all commodities together, lumped together.  The derivative market for that.  And imagine if you're on the wrong side of this trade.  It is ugly beyond ugly.  And this is going to take out counterparties.  That's the key.  If you've gone, oh, thank God I was short oil.  And then you go into collect, good night.  The intercontinental exchange, ICE, is going to be destroyed.  Yes, the same criminals that run the back system in cryptocurrency.  Destroyed.  Why?  Because all their members are getting destroyed.  They are ultimately the counterparty.  If their counterparties fail, they're in charge of it.  Oh my God.  Good night.  Good night, ICE.  Wild oil market sees record contango as expiry nears.  Oil in New York has slumped to its weakest structure on record as the current contract nears expiration, adding extra volatility to a market that's grappling with a glut and evaporating demand.  West Texas intermediate crude futures on Monday fell to the biggest ever discount to those for the following month, a structure known as contango that indicates near-term oversupply.  It's It's amplified.  Now, listen to this.  That's just the physical stuff.  There's just too much of it.  It's amplified by expiry of the current contract on Tuesday.  Surprise, surprise.  You don't think this was a setup?  Absolutely.  As traders sell soon-to-be outdated futures and buy up those with a longer shelf life.  The current contract for May supply declined 30% to $12.85 a barrel by 12.23 p.m.  London time, the lowest since 1999.  Imagine all the money that's been printed since 1999, and oil is the exact same price.  By contrast, more desirable June futures were down by 9% to $22.75, leaving a spread of $9.90.  The oil market is broken, just like gold and silver markets.  The contract expiration is when the white-collar financial derivatives trading intersect with the blue-collar world of pipelines and storage tanks.  Tens of billions of dollars traded every day in WTI futures are almost always settled financially, but any contract that hasn't been closed out after expiry has to be liquidated with physical delivery of oil if the parties can't come to some kind of over-the-counter agreement.  Those deliveries go to the storage hub of Cushing, Oklahoma, which is connected by pipelines to Canada, U.S.  Midwest, West Texas, and Gulf Coast.  The problem is that Cushing is rapidly failing as fuel consumption collapses due to lockdowns to stem the coronavirus pandemic.  Crude stockpiles ballooned by almost 16 million barrels in the three weeks through April 10th to 55 million barrels.  The hub had a working capacity of 76 million as of September 30th.  That's bad news if you're long May futures because if you don't close out your position by the end of Trading Tuesday, which is tomorrow, you have just a few days to let the seller know how you're going to accept the delivery, which is due from May 1st to May 31st.  At the rate Cushing is feeling, finding space is going to be difficult, especially for financial traders who rarely deal with the physical world.  That's one of the reasons why May Contracts is trading at such a discount to those in June.  The wide gap is also being driven by the large flows of exchange-traded funds into the June contract.  The U.S.  oil fund accounted for 25% of the outstanding June crude as of last week.  This is insane.  This is not oil being traded on exchange.  This is derivative nerds sitting in their office clicking a mouse.  Manipulators at J.P.  Morgan and friends clicking a mouse.  Problem is, there's going to be so many counterparties.  This is the largest derivative, largest commodity derivative market in the world.  Imagine three quarters of them getting wiped out in a single day tomorrow.  And then when do derivative contracts settle?  About 30 days afterwards.  Getting close to putting down my timeline.  So this came out of the Fed.  The Fed Boston with the same road to rooted documents.  Why do banks fail?  Bank is a business like any other business.  They can fail.  Sometimes they fail because the people who run them make poor decisions, such as expanding too quickly or putting too much money into one type of loan.  Sometimes they fail because of fraud.  Maybe the president makes questionable loans to friends or hires unqualified relatives and pays them huge salaries.  But banks also go out of business because changing economic conditions make it difficult or impossible for borrowers to repay their loans.  Here's an example.  Now, this is the example they're talking about.  And by the way, the very next page is the page of the picture that looks just like the GATA picture, gold antitrust action picture, except it's the Fed bathed in sunlight with an open door instead of the darkness, coming out of the darkness.  Anyway, this is what they said.  This is the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.  This is the original documents, the red road to root of theory.  Gusher National Bank slips on falling oil prices.  Falling energy prices mean cheaper gasoline and lower home heating bills, so falling oil prices must be good, right?  Not for everyone.  Take the case of Gusher National Bank.  Gusher was very aggressive in making loans to oil and natural gas companies that had no problem repaying their loans when energy prices were high.  The loans spelled big profits for Gusher, and everyone agreed that Gusher's executives were smart business people who really knew how to make money.  Then the economy slowed down and the demand for energy fell.  Factories burned less oil and natural gas.  Truck drivers, commuters, vacationers drove fewer miles and burned less fuel.  As a result, energy prices dropped sharply and many energy companies fell behind on their loan payments.  Some even stopped making payments altogether.  Months passed, oil prices remained low, and more energy companies fell behind on their payments.  Finally, Gusher lost so much money to the bad loans that government regulators had to step in and close Gusher National Bank.  Gusher had fallen victim to changing economic conditions, falling energy prices, and a high concentration of loans to energy companies.  It doesn't even talk about derivatives.  Now, this was written in 1987. at the same time they released the Silver Eagle, the original Silver Eagle Act, which created, was Barney Frank put that bill into effect in the U.S.  Congress, creating silver and gold eagles.  The same time this pamphlet came out.  Now, they redid it on January 1st, 2007.  And then they threw in, here's another thing gold bugs will love in this pamphlet.  In this little pamphlet here, let me jump back here.  If you're a gold bug, you're going to love this picture.  Look at that.  Look at that.  Someone going into the bank with 19 gold coins and cash it in for dollars at a bank.  What bank deals in gold coins?  See the, uh, the, uh, The graph of the gold price on the wall.  That was the plan.  That was always the plan to go to a physical gold standard.  She's either getting coins or giving money.  It's not quite clear.  But it is clear.  what the Fed's saying is that we are returning to a gold standard.  At least we were when this was published and when their original was published.  Now it might be crypto related.  Or it might be both.  I say both.  Let's do both.  Gold, silver, cryptos.  Let's say we can use anything we want because we are free Americans.  What do you think of that?  Anyway, so yeah, that's what's going on with Gusher National Bank.  And then, of course, the next one, they talk about two banks squeezed right between.  the GATA picture, is Bedrock Bank gets too big too fast.  That's all about the housing crash.  2008, we saw that, but we didn't quite see the oil destruction.  This right here, is the oil destruction.  Oil plunges below $5.  Now, interesting, Pepe Escobar wrote an article in January talking about the nuclear option will settle Trump's oil war.  And that was talking about the same thing, the destruction of the oil derivative market, but it was the other way.  It was talking about.  blowing up tankers in the street of Hormuz would have drove the price of oil so high that the derivative players on the other side would have been destroyed.  So people who bought this, bought into this article, went long oil, literally got destroyed.  And here's one of them.  Heng Long is said to have failed to declare $800 million in losses.  The son of legendary oil trader and founder Heng Long Trading said Singapore-based company had suffered about $800 million in losses from futures trading that weren't reflected in its financial statements.  According to people knowledgeable about the matter, that was just the other day.  They just, oh, by the way, I have $800 million in losses I didn't even know about.  That's what happens when you get a black swan event in derivatives.  Destruction.  Here's another one.  ABN Ambro files claims against Singapore's trouble oil firm.  So ABN Ambro is a counterparty.  There's all kinds of counterparties.  ABN Ambro is a large bank that had lines of credit with Hinn Long Group.  It's one after the other.  That's the cascading effect of destroying the derivative system.  ABN Ambro has become the latest lender to make claims against Singapore oil trading giant that filed for protection from its creditors amongst plunging oil prices.  The Dutch bank filed applications for charges related to irrevocable letters of credit.  Amsterdam-based lender is the second bank to file charges linked to Hoang Ninh, which owes $4 billion to more than 20 Singaporean international banks, including HSBC, DBS, Standard Chartered.  HSBC is huge in the commodity derivative space, huge criminal player, just like Deutsche Bank and J.P.  Morgan.  HSBC is going to get destroyed with these prices.  And if it's not because of their derivative bets, it's because they have customers who can't pay anymore.  And don't forget, just last September, Mitsubishi says, Hmm, I wonder if it's related to Kinlong.  But that's the kind of stuff that happens when oil starts to go crazy.  And when it goes down below five bucks, half the people are destroyed.  Half the people, half the contracts in oil are destroyed.  The long contracts, forget it.  It's over.  Right now, massive, massive, massive failure to delivers are going to happen in oil.  It's just going to be a calamity.  And that's where we're headed at probably the weakest time in financial history.  They'll be ready for it.
