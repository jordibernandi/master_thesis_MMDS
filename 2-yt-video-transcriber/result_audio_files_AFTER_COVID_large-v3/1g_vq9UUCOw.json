Oh, I think she hurt herself.  He went and got her a Band-Aid.  Are they actually fingerprinting her?  Really?  They're fingerprinting her.  Running her through the database.  We got her fingerprint.  See if she has any wants and warrants.  They're riding two per car now.  Very seldom I've seen them ride two in each bar.  That tells me they're scared of the sleeping giant.  Oh man, I lost my rubber.  Yeah.  My phone just went dim.  It's telling me that it's getting warm. ",
