            "text": "This, loosely, is the position of the anarchist.  The anarchist argues that because of the inviolability of individuals, no state can be justified.  For Nozick, this is the fundamental question of political philosophy, whether there should be any state at all.  he wants to justify what he calls a minimal state one that simply protects an individual's right to freedom and nothing else.  he wants to argue that this is both justified philosophically and could develop from a state of nature historically against Rawls' redistributive state, he also wants to maintain that this is where it would stop any further redistribution of wealth being a violation of natural morality, our natural rights.  The question then is this, how, if it's morally impermissible to violate individuals' rights, would a state still develop over time with no morally impermissible steps?  Imagine a state of nature.  The state of nature has no state, no political institutions, no culture, just pre-state humans living naturally.  As we've seen, in Nozick's state of nature, individuals have natural rights.  He borrows this argument from Locke, and briefly it looks something like this.  Individuals are born with their own lives, their own faculties, their own choices and thrown into a world which must be made use of.  If an individual plucks an apple from a tree in a state of nature to eat, by mixing his labour with it, that person makes the apple their property, all of which arises out of man and earth's nature.  This, in brief, is natural rights theory.  If someone violates these rights by harming another, for example, or stealing from them, they violated the law of nature.  So how would these violations be dealt with in a state of nature?  How would people address troublemakers?  Nozick says people would of course defend themselves, or they'd band together in defence of each other, but some people would be too weak and secure by exchange protection from the stronger.  In short, he says, in union there is strength. ",

Disputes would be resolved internally without resorting to violence.  Costs would decrease.  A geographic area being protected would both increase in size and be more safe.  and some agencies would simply be better at protecting their clients than others.  Slowly, a monopoly of kinds would develop in any given area.  Nozick writes that, out of anarchy, pressed by spontaneous groupings, mutual protection associations, division of labor, market pressures, economies of scale, and rational self-interest, there arises something very much resembling a minimal state or a group of geographically distinct minimal states.  this natural historic development he calls an invisible hand explanation for the emergence of society of the state.

One, it appears to allow some people to enforce their own rights, and two, it appears not to protect all individuals within its domain.  In other words, a person might take the law into their own hands without violating the law of nature, setting up their own protection agencies or arguing that they have the right to enforce the law of nature themselves.  and others would opt out of paying for security completely.  A state, of course, would not allow this.  Nozick's justification for a state arising is centered around risk and fear. ",

            "text": "He writes, an independent might be prohibited from privately exacting justice because his procedure is known to be too risky and dangerous.  The dominant protection agency may judge the rights of any procedure being applied to its clients and punish anyone who judges their client unfairly.  It might, for example, publish a list of procedures, codes, practices and laws it deems fair and reliable.  This leads to a monopoly over the right to practice the law and enforce it.  The dominant agency becomes the final arbiter of rights and justice in the geographic area.  This is a de facto monopoly on violence, the minimal state.  Nozick argues that this is the only philosophically just state.  Any further move into taxation or redistribution is a violation of those individual natural rights, a state coercing citizens by taking their property.  He argues that philosophers like Rawls or proponents of the welfare state, for example, have a conception of justice that is patterned and that enforcing the pattern leads to coercion.  Not only that, once you create the pattern, the pattern starts to fall apart as people do what they want again.  The only just distribution is one where property or holdings have been passed from person to person voluntarily, without coercion, without a violation of rights.  He calls this a theory of justice in holdings, as a nod to rules.  He writes that the general outlines of the theory of justice in holdings are that the holdings of a person are just if he is entitled to them by the principles of justice in acquisition and transfer.  He continues, if each person's holdings are just, then the total set distribution of holdings is just.  as long as the holding is acquired fairly and that transfers between people are consented to and voluntary then the resulting pattern is by virtue of natural rights law just.  In contradistinction to this, any attempt to redistribute according to a pattern like from each according to his blank to each according to his blank is a violation of liberty, of people's rights to choose, and to the just transfer of property over time.  Nozick illustrates his argument about patterns being unrealizable with his Wilt Chamberlain example.  He asks us to imagine a society in which justice is meant to be achieved by a pattern, like Rawls's difference principle.  In this society, the distribution of wealth is meant to adhere to some kind of blueprint of what is fair and just.  The resulting distribution, the pattern, is then achieved through redistribution, say, in this example.  In this imaginary society, the famous basketball player Wilt Chamberlain charges 25 cents to his fans to watch him play basketball.  Over the season, he earns 250 grand.  This is so much more than anyone else in the society that it disrupts the just pattern that has just been achieved.  But all of the fans have freely, of their own liberty, given Chamberlain their 25 cents.  So, Nozick asks, how can the new distribution not be just? ",

Both rules and Nozick provide little justification for their foundations.  The choice between the contractarian position of rules and the natural rights position of Nozick are made on intuition, leaving both open to criticism.  Anarcho-capitalist Murray Rothbard has also criticised Nozick by asking, if his theory is true, why has no such state developed naturally and historically?  He should, he argues, advocate for anarchism and wait for his minimal state to develop. ",

I absolutely love doing it.  I'm going to make two or three videos a month and continue to improve the quality and the research.  and do a few more experiments and chats and rambles in between.  But it is a time-consuming job.  It's a full-time job and it is just me.  So unfortunately right now Patreon is still the only way that Then and Now survives.  So if you get any value from these videos whatsoever then please consider pledging a dollar or two dollars on Patreon.  If you pledge five dollars or ten dollars or more even, I will add your name to the credits, I will put scripts and the audio, and at some point the video's out early for Patreons only, so if there's anything you'd like to see there then please let me know.  But if you can't afford that right now then of course it's enough to just press like, subscribe, share, and remember to click that bell to be notified to new videos.
