            "text": "The first pillar to your left on the screen would be the rapture of the church.  Jesus will shout.  The archangel will shout.  The trump of God will sound.  That's the rapture.  We'll be caught up to meet Him in the air.  That's 1 Thessalonians 4 and verse 16 and 17, chapter 4 and verse 2 of the book of Revelation.  We see someone on a throne.  By the way, chapters 4 and 5 are the only window that we have into the third heaven.  If you want to know what's in the third heaven, you go to chapters 4 and 5 of the book of Revelation.  And there in chapter 5 and verse 12, to be exact, you see 10,000 times 10,000 angels.  That's 100 million angels plus thousands and thousands more singing, Worthy is the Lamb.  And then as we move into the tribulation period, thereafter the rapture, and before we get over to the return, at the beginning of that seven-year tribulation period, in chapter 6, we see the beginning of three sets of seven judgments.  There are seven seal judgments, seven trumpet judgments, and seven vial judgments.  In chapter 6 and then chapter 8, verse 1, you have the seven seal judgments.  In chapters 8, 9, and 11, you have the seven trumpet judgments.  And in chapter 16, you have the last of those seven judgments, which will basically take place in about a six-month period of time, because they are so intense on the people on the earth, the Lord says, I can't continue any longer or all the people will disappear.  And by the way, that happens the six months prior to the return of Jesus Christ, which is your second pillar. ",
