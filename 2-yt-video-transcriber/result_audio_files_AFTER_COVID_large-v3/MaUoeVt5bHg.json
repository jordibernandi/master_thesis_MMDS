            "text": "One person coming in from China.  We think it's going to have a very good ending.  A lot of people think that goes away in April with the heat.  When it gets a little warmer, it miraculously goes away.  Oh, that's true.  It's not been spreading very much.  Very good shape.  I think it's going to work out fine.  Very well under control.  The risk to the American people remains very low.  View this the same as the flu.  It's going to disappear.  One day it's like a miracle.  It will disappear.  Almost everybody that we see is getting better.  Now the Democrats are politicizing.  And this is their new hoax.  Number one in the world for preparedness.  The Obama administration made a decision on testing.  That turned out to be very detrimental.  Like the numbers being where they are.  Anybody that wants a test can get a test.  Because it's really working out.  I think we're going to get through it very well.  Okay.  Let's put it this way.  I'm not concerned.  No, I don't take responsibility at all.  That is the biggest one-day point drop of all time.  They shouldn't be criticizing because we've done a fantastic job.  The federal government's not a shipping clerk.  Chloroquine, and some people would add to it, hydroxy, it's not going to kill anybody.  We're really backing up the governors.  The governors have to go out and do their thing.  All you have to do is look at the Approval numbers.  We can't have the cure be worse than the problem.  Easter Sunday and you'll have packed churches all over our country.  I think it would be a beautiful time.  More tests than anybody by far.  It's hard not to be happy with the job we're doing.  We've now established great testing.  We inherited a broken system.  I want them to be appreciative.  Don't call the woman in Michigan.  If they don't treat you right, I don't call.  We should be a backup.  We're not an ordering clerk.  We're a backup.  And I hope they use the hydroxychloroquine.  What do you have to lose?  What do I know?  I'm not a doctor.  We're the federal government.  We're not supposed to stand on street corners doing testing.  The authority is total.  Your people will be very happy to get a big, fat, beautiful check and my name is on it.  22 million out of work.  And then I see the disinfectant injection inside.  Sounds interesting to me. ",
