            "text": "Ladies, gentlemen and enbies, just want to let you know that the media discussed within this video contains strong language, gore, animal mutilation, sexual coercion and sexual assault against children.  You know, all things that you would expect to find in an adaptation of Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol.  Wait, what?  Happy holidays, everyone!  As we approach the end of the year, it's time for us to look back at all our favourite stories that we like to indulge in every December.  It's the non-denominational festive winter period in the pandemic year.  It has never been more socially acceptable to just stay at home and watch movies all the time.  I love Christmas movies, and I always get excited to watch them, from the classics to the new ones to the nostalgic favourites to just everything in between.  It's just a really simple way to feel good, you know?  Probably my favourite thing to watch this time of year is adaptations of Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol.  I love watching all the different ways we can see Ebenezer Scrooge learn that actually, maybe he should try being nice to people for a change.  I love watching Albert Finney being completely oblivious to people dancing on his coffin.  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  That's the nicest thing that anyone's ever done for me.  I love watching Patrick Stewart not knowing how to laugh.  I love watching Michael Caine doing this little dance.  Look at him go!  This is perhaps the single most joyous moment in any film ever.  I love this story a whole lot, and I get hyped whenever I discover versions of it I haven't seen before.  So imagine my excitement last year when I saw that the BBC were doing a three-part miniseries adaptation.  I sat down to watch it with my family and, well, you've seen the title.  This particular adaptation of A Christmas Carol was created for the BBC and aired on FX in the US.  All three episodes were directed by Nick Murphy, it stars Guy Pearce as Scrooge, and what every piece of marketing honed in on, it was written by Stephen Knight.  Stephen Knight is a writer who is essentially TV royalty in the UK.  This is for a couple of reasons.  First, he co-created Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?  Bockwild.  Second, he is the showrunner of the hugely popular Peaky Blinders, a show I was an extra in one time.  you can't see me in it.  As a result of these successes, he is a writer in very high demand who has allowed a lot of creative freedom with his works, so it's only natural that he was chosen to make an adaptation of A Christmas Carol.  The direction that he went with it is Not my cup of tea.  To give you an idea of the tone of this whole thing, let me just describe to you the cold open of the first episode.  It is England, 1843, the eve of Christmas Eve.  We are in a cemetery where a raven perches on a grave, flying away as a teenage boy draws near.  The boy walks up to the grave, says, You skinflint old bastard!  and proceeds to piss all over the gravestone, revealing the name Jacob Marley.  Then he leaves, and we pan down through the earth into the coffin, where the piss drips into the eyes of Marley's corpse, and he wakes up and complains that he can't get any peace.  The inscription clearly states, Rest in peace!  Why am I not allowed any peace?  To be clear, the opening of this adaptation of A Christmas Carol, the scene that will set the tone for everything that is to come in the following three hours of television, Is Jacob Marley getting a golden shower?  We might just be in trouble here, folks.  The whole of this adaptation is trying desperately to be dark and edgy.  It's full of the feeling that a lot of modern period dramas have, where the sets are all dingy, everyone acts really intensely all the time, and it's meant to show that living in that time period actually wasn't as romanticised as we make it out to be.  And it just doesn't feel like a Christmas carol.  I'm not sure why anyone thought this was the right direction to take one of the most wholesome and warm-hearted stories ever written.  But they did, and I watched it, and here we are.  The main meat of this is essentially a character study on Ebenezer Scrooge, a look into his past, present and future to understand exactly why he is the way he is, and how he can hope to change himself for the better.  The details of that here are decidedly different to that of Dickens' novel, seemingly to fit in with the overall tone shift towards the darker, edgier material.  Our introduction to Scrooge establishes his character visually.  We see him melting away the ice from his window, carefully wiping away the drips of water as he does so.  Scrooge is meticulous and detailed.  He notices everything and won't let even the slightest thing pass him by, because if he controls the details, he controls the profit.  We see him rationing out the coal for Bob Cratchit, and allowing him an extra piece, smudging his sleeve in the process. ",

As his day goes on, we see how he uses his focus on details to cope with being overwhelmed by noises from the street.  He hears all these noises coming through and he breaks it down into who and what is there, how long they've been there, how often they call out, all of the possible numbers that he can pull out of the mess to make sense of it.  This is our Scrooge in this adaptation.  He is detailed and meticulous as a coping mechanism to deal with the world that he lives in, but also still the tight-fisted businessman who thinks of nothing but himself.  This is the person we see being deconstructed for the rest of the runtime.  The first thing of Scrooge's life that we are shown by the Ghost of Christmas Past is his father, a character we never see in the book and have no real frame of reference for.  Here, he's a violent drunk who just went bankrupt and is furious about the pet mouse that Scrooge's sister Lottie has just given him as a Christmas present.  Another mouth to feed with a golden bell around its neck.  something he can't allow in this household, and something we see him take revolting action on.  Seemingly, the Ghost did this just to mess with Scrooge, just dredging up his childhood trauma to shake him up and not really teach him a lesson.  To actually teach Scrooge something, we go to his time at boarding school, staying there over the Christmas holidays.  The Ghost, who now appears as Scrooge's childhood imagining of Ali Baba, because I guess it was cheaper to hire two camels than it was to have Andy Serkis on set for a few more days, has brought him back to one very specific Christmas.  We see young Scrooge reading before he is visited by the school's headmaster who... ",

The Ghost needs Scrooge to see this, and so takes him to one of the mines that he and Marley bought and cut costs on, leading to a cave-in.  Scrooge has to see exactly the human cost of his business practices.  All he and Marley cared about was saving money on timber, not the people who actually worked in the mine.  We were given a similar look at this cost earlier when Marley showed him an accident at one of their factories, with all the lines that cost.  The mine serves to show that this wasn't an isolated incident, but Scrooge and Marley's standard operating procedure.  This is followed up by seeing him and Marley buying up a business, firing all the employees and selling it for a massive profit.  All of these examples show that Scrooge just never once considered that there was anything to this business other than the money.  He can tell you the exact amount of profit that he made every year he conducted business, but could not tell you a single thing about any of the people who worked for him.  To him, they were just an insignificant detail, only a piece of how he makes his profit.  However, to really show Scrooge the very human cost of what he does, he perhaps needs a tight and individual example.  So we see what he did seven Christmases ago.  Mary Cratchit came to Scrooge looking for money to help with medical bills for Tiny Tim.  Scrooge offers her the money she needs, if she'll come to his rooms on Christmas Day and do exactly what he tells her. ",

Now it seems to me that this doesn't actually match up to anything we've learned about Scrooge up to this point.  We've seen he's uncaring to others and that money drives him to the point where he doesn't think about their feelings, but he never felt like some sort of sadist who liked to toy with people's limits for an experiment.  It almost feels like a totally different character creeps in for these scenes just to justify an even bigger conflict between Scrooge and the Cratchits.  Deeply humiliated by this, Mary has to keep it a secret, lest her family be torn apart by it.  This is the major focus of what The Ghost of Christmas Present, who is Scrooge's sister Lottie for reasons, I suppose, shows him.  The family struggling under the weight of this secret, this pain that he is the sole cause of.  This is Scrooge's most monstrous and shameful regret, that he did this to this woman, and to her husband and children.  This sees the biggest change in Scrooge, as he finally sees the people and not the details and numbers.  Before, you counted everything.  This time, you looked. ",

I feel quite conflicted about it, because on the one hand, this is a very timely message.  Even if the people who have valued money more than human life pledge to do better, the harm they've done can't be erased.  The damage doesn't just go away.  But on the other hand, if Scrooge really can't be redeemed, then what's the point?  This entire adaptation is built around just skipping over the major goal of the story.  It's quite a difficult one to judge, because I do find this to be a legitimately interesting reimagining that is delivered quite well in this scene.  But it comes in this adaptation that just doesn't get the rest of the story or tone right.  Speaking of his intentions for this adaptation, Stephen Knight said this.  What I wanted to do.  when Dickens was writing, it wasn't really the job of the novelist to necessarily find out why the character was the way he was.  But now in this post post post Freudian world, one wonders why a character like that exists.  What made him like that?  What experiences did he have to make that happen?  And so that's what I have tried to look at.  So he wanted to make a version of A Christmas Carol that really delved into Scrooge and pieced together exactly who he is and how he came to be.  But we already have a deep character study version of A Christmas Carol that really gets into the psychology of Ebenezer Scrooge.  It's called A Christmas Carol.  It baffles me that Stephen Knight doesn't think that Dickens gets to.  what makes this character tick when it's literally all that the book does.  I don't want to discredit him as a writer.  He's had an interesting career, and his work is clearly connected with a lot of people, but I just really don't think he understood this book as he adapted it.  What sits the worst for me in this whole thing is probably the characterisation of everyone other than Scrooge.  The cynicism of the adaptation extends to basically every character.  In the book, everyone except for Scrooge is wonderfully sincere, and it serves as a perfect counterpoint to him.  But in this adaptation, there is no counterpoint.  everyone feels just as miserable and bitter as him.  After Scrooge rejects nephew Fred's dinner offer, Fred says that it's the last time they'll ever see him.  Fred's characterisation in the book is as someone who will simply never give up on Scrooge, no matter how he pushes him away.  He just can't, because he sees the good in even the meanest creature.

If every character is as hopeless and miserable as Scrooge, then what joy is there in seeing him change?  And if he isn't worthy of redemption, then is there even a story worth telling at all?  In the preface to the book, Dickens says, I have endeavoured in this ghostly little book to raise the ghost of an idea, which shall not put my readers out of humour with themselves, with each other, with the season, or with me.  May it haunt their houses pleasantly, and no one wish to lay it.  This adaptation does not haunt the house pleasantly.  It's ugly, mean-spirited, and insincere.  And even though it does raise at least one interesting ghost of an idea, it's simply not worth your time.  A Christmas Carol is timeless.  It's a story that we tell over and over again.  And as we approach the end of this year, I can think of no better way to spend your time than giving this adaptation a miss and reading or listening to or watching your favourite version of Dickens' ghostly little book.  I would like to give an extra special thanks to my Ghost of Frankenstein patron, William Gray, my Son of Frankenstein patron, Chris Harper, and my Bride of Frankenstein patrons whose names are appearing on the screen right now.

If you do, you'll get to see all my videos early, get exclusive bloopers, and access to my private Discord server.  If not, then you can still help out a lot by liking, commenting, subscribing, or clicking one of the videos that will pop up at the end.  Thank you so much for all the support this year, it's been a really fun time and I'm looking forward to whatever ridiculous stuff that I can make in 2021.  Until then folks, me and Frank just want to say, happy holidays. ",
