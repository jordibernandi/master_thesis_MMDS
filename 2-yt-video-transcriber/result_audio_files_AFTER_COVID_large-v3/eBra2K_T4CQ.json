Personal atmospheric visual range.  Atmospheric obstruction, which only affects the bottom part of objects but not the top part of objects.  diffraction which they have no understanding of whatsoever, and basically a hodgepodge of excuses as to why atmospheric effects will cause the sun to appear to set below the horizon every night and rise the next morning on the opposite side of the earth.  So this is Bob the Science Guy signing out from northern Michigan.  Make sure you hit that little like and subscribe button down there, and thank you very much for stopping by.  And by the way, Flat Earth, Explain to me why that sun pillar is lighting up the bottom side of the clouds at sunset.  You can clearly see the sun on the horizon.  You can clearly see the redness and the under lighting of the clouds.  How's that work out?  Take care, guys. ",
