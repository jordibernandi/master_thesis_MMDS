            "text": "Hello everyone, this is just a quick video to let you know that there's a new video out on my Patreon, patreon.com slash azurescapegoat.  And you may be asking why is it on YouTube?  And it's because of the content ID system on YouTube.  DreamWorks really does not want me to use any footage or audio from the first Shrek movie.  Even though it is completely transformative, we do not show any part of the movie that we do not critique or analyze, and that makes it transformative, and that does make it fair use under US copyright law.  But YouTube doesn't give a shit, and so even though I tried to manipulate the video in a bunch of ways to try to make the ID system not recognize it, I couldn't do it.  So it's on my Patreon.  That's the only place you'll find it.  And I'm sorry it's not on YouTube.  I couldn't even make it unlisted or like unmonetized because DreamWorks policy is just to completely block the video in all regions.  So it's not even that I could monetize it.  It's just like it's impossible for it to be on YouTube and be seen by anyone.  So that sucks.  And I'm sorry.  I really did want to publish it for everyone so that everyone could see it because I worked hard on it.  You know, I spent a long time editing it and working on it and stuff.  But yeah, it's only one dollar to see it.  I made it available to all Patreon tiers.  Right.  So I have three tiers, one, five and ten dollars.  But all tiers can see it.  You only need to pay one dollar and you'll get the link to go see it.  And yeah, that's it.  You don't have to, you know, you don't have to keep paying me like next month or anything.  Just you can pledge a dollar now and then just.  drop out don't even have to pay anything else next month.  like it's fine.  but if you do want to support this channel then you know.  patreon if you know if you want don't like go out of your way to give me money though like take care of yourself first like this fucking youtube channel is not that important it's fine But thank you to everyone who did donate.  This video was actually a Patreon goal for reaching $100 a month and we reached it and that's great.  So this video is like a thank you to all the patrons and all the people who like helped me financially with this YouTube channel.  So thank you very much and again I really do sincerely apologize that the video is not available on YouTube for free to watch.  I really, really, really tried.  But after like two days straight of just like editing, rendering, editing, rendering, editing, rendering, just trying to get a video out that wouldn't be recognized by the ID system, I just gave up because I tried everything.  I tried mirroring and shrinking and adding backgrounds and changing the audio and just tried everything.  It just did not work.  So it sucks, but it is how it is.  I still hope you could see it.  I still hope people actually, you know, go watch it.  Uh, not just because I want money.  That's not really what it's about.  I just, I want people to see the video because I think it's a really good video and it's like an hour and 20 minutes long.  We had loads of fun recording it.  So if you are a patron already, go and go and watch it.  Let me know what you think.  You can tweet me, you can comment on the patron post or whatever.  Join my discord link in the description.  Um, Yeah, just let me know what you think.  Because I thought it was good.  And copyright sucks and we should abolish copyright.  Yeah, that's it.  Alright, thanks.  See ya. ",
