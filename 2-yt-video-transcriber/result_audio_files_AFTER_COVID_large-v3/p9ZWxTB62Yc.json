            "text": "We are going to ask you to leave your promises if you're not conducting any official business here.  Well, we are conducting official business as the First Amendment protects freedom of speech and freedom of press in all public areas.  going on guys auditing america shout outs to fake mike real news.  go to his channel and subscribe.  also.  go to chase from the allen report.  make sure you go to chase's channel.  subscribe us as well.  show support.  we're at the brevard county cervix service complex in melbourne florida.  We're gonna see what type of service they provide and if they're courteous and professional.  Of course, if they respect our First Amendment.  Let's see how it goes.  Sir, what are you doing?  I'm sorry?  What are you doing?  Just working on a little video.  Here we go.  We're just working on a little video.  We're not trying to bother no one.  You're not allowed back here with your cameras.  You can video.  It's pretty welcoming right here, right?  Sir, I'm sorry.  You can video out front, but you cannot come back here and video.  Due to Driver Protection Act and privacy policies, you are not allowed to video back here.  Okay.  If you would like to video in this area.  Does it say a restricted area right here?  The tree is.  you are not allowed to video into this room.  Where does it say that?  Sir.  Where does it say that?  Specifically, specifically.  Specifically.  Oh, now we're breaking the law?  How you doing, gentlemen?  Can I have your name and badge number, please?  Yeah, 390.  Right there on the patrol car.  Oh, thank you so much.  Can you please protect our rights?  You guys fought to protect the First Amendment.  We're here just taking pictures peacefully.  In the United States, the government works for us and the people created the government to protect our inalienable rights.  And the Declaration of Independence says one of those rights have gone awry.  It is our duty, our responsibility to abolish that.  Obviously, public servants, we're $23 trillion in debt.  We have illegal and constitutional wars.  We just want to make sure that the people we're paying very good money to are doing the right thing and that our first right to freedom of the press is secure.  You don't have to have a whole bunch of makeup and corporate sponsors behind you.  Long story short, You're the boss.  You're the boss.  You're the boss.  You're the boss.  This is not Walmart or Target or Starbucks.  This is a public place.  We all chipped into this.  All human beings, all Americans, especially, have the right to travel.  Whenever you're asking for a license, you're asking for permission for a right that you don't otherwise have.  Of course, we have the right to travel.  It wasn't until the 1950s until they started deeming things commercial vehicles.  yeah you have to go get government permission and we just came from a city hall the other day.  you have to ask the government permission to have a yard sale on your own.  we have the right to travel but according to the government your right to travel is with these two right here.  hey how are you?  how are you good?  can i have your name and batch number please sir?  yeah it's session right here sir thank you.  okay Why do you think we need so many police officers over here for just a couple guys with cameras?  Well, do you have any legitimate business here?  We do.  We're working on a story on the Brevard County Service Complex.  We're also trying to... Do you have any legitimate business for the tag office right now?  Yes.  Do you have an appointment?  Do you have an appointment?  Sir, can you please stop for a second?  Why not?  Because I'm going to see what's going on.  Okay, so get us a public records request form, please.  You see, just because of your body language, I know that you're not going to agree with us.  This is the sergeant.  So right now, you can already tell, even though we have good hopes for the Melbourne Police Department.  No, I don't.  I don't.  So we go all across the country doing this.  You can tell, you know, we went to one city hall.  We got a great response.  The other one, we have tyrants with crazy mustaches.  You don't have to wear it.  You don't have to.  The police aren't wearing it.  Even the police aren't wearing it.  Even the mandate itself has medical exemptions.  And if they have to ask you for medical exemption, it's your HIPAA privacy.  And they can make executive orders that are unconstitutional all they want.  They can say, hey, no Irish need apply.  If you don't feel like wearing a mask, you say I'm medically exempt.  No one can ask you for... for any medical paperwork.  You know, that's the HIPAA law.  I'd rather have a mask.  You can wear, oh, that's the good thing, too.  You have the freedom to wear one.  Exactly.  It's your choice.  Here, in this, specifically in this building, it's your choice.  I think I'll go get my mask.  Sure.  Sure.  That's very good.  So can we get a public records request form?  I can give you a public records request.  Thank you.  Thank you, please.  Thank you, please.  You called a lot of cops here for geyser cameras.  Do that first.  Do that first.  We are going to ask you to leave the premises if you're not conducting any official business here.  Well, we are conducting official business as the First Amendment protects freedom of speech and freedom of press in all public areas.  Can you get that phone right now?  I can.  Let's do that right now.  Yep.  And we're going to sit down and fill it out.  And you guys are going to hang tight.  OK?  You are the sergeant.  Is that correct?  Yes.  OK.  So obviously, this is a public building.  Is that not correct?  In a way, they also have the authority to trespass people.  In a way.  For what crime?  What authority and what crime?  If there's no business here.  Okay, so as I just told you right here, the First Amendment, which you took an oath before that.  Okay, let me explain to you something.  Do you know what the IRS is?  This is a public building paid by our tax dollars.  We're in charge here.  You guys have to work.  This isn't the right thing.  I'm going to spaz on them.  I'm going to own them.  Take some deep breaths.  Look, you see?  These videos.  Has anyone in this room heard about YouTube revenue?  Any type of revenue that you generate on the internet or anywhere in this country, what do you have to do?  You have to come to a building like this and you have to pay.  So we do have legitimate business in this country.  It doesn't make a difference.  All of these officers right here took an oath before God and their countrymen.  We don't even need to do any paperwork or anything.  We could be here.  Because video recording is our official business.  But they don't understand that.  They don't understand free press.  The First Amendment and the Supreme Court have upheld that photography alone cannot be used as a suspicion of a crime.  These gentlemen over there, they dedicated their lives and they took an oath before God and their countrymen to protect our rights against tyrants.  And now they're saying even though we pay their salary and we're in a public area which we finance and we're engaging in a constitutionally protected act which they swore an oath to protect, they're going to deny that.  And that's exactly what the Redcoats did for a very long time.  In the state of Rhode Island, if you're being wrongfully arrested, the law says that you can't resist an unlawful arrest.  Like, even if you know deep in your heart that you didn't do it and a police officer is taking you, they want you to just relax, go to jail, even though you didn't do anything.  And then we'll figure it out later at court.  And they're not going to drop these charges anytime soon.  Usually they just make you a quick offer.  If you don't have money for an attorney, you're going to get the public defender who also has lunch and breakfast with the prosecutor every morning in the same building.  They work in the same building.  They see each other every day.  And then they figure out how to make a little extra money from you getting in trouble even though you didn't do anything.  Probation, all these type of programs.  They send people to... Can you fill it out for me?  No, sir.  You fill it out.  All right, okay.  You'll fill it out and give it back to ladies, and your business is done here, and then you can leave.  How do you know it's done?  Okay, have a good day.  No, sir.  As I said at the very beginning, our business is the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.  You took an oath to that before God and Americans.  So we have business.  It's called freedom of press.  You only have a certain amount of time to fill it out.  No, no, we do not have a certain amount of time.  We don't have a certain amount of time.  No, we don't.  Sir, you served an oath to the Constitution, and you're acting like a tyrant.  You're a tyrant.  That's your opinion.  Turn in your gun.  It's a fact.  You're just standing on your constitutional rights.  You're an idiot, right?  Who wrote the Federalist Papers?  Who wrote the Federalist Papers?  Do you know what the fucking Federalist Papers are?  No, you don't, because you're a fucking moron.  You're a moron that doesn't know your rights.  And you just dishonored your oath before God and the American people.  You're going to be seen by millions of people and known as a tyrant.  I'm going to kick your ass back to Britain, bitch.  What's your name?  What's your name?  Stop right there.  Stop right there.  Stop right there.  Stop right there.  Stop right there.  What's your name?  You need to defend us.  You need to protect our rights right now.  So you have a choice right now.  You have a choice right now to defend the Constitution or be a red coat.  Please protect us.  You need to stay away from me.  Please protect us.  Because I don't like you this close.  It's a danger to my safety.  You have a gun, idiot.  You have a gun.  You have a gun.  And you're on my gun side.  You're getting triggered.  No, I'm not.  You have a weapon.  You're getting triggered by a man with the Constitution.  And you have a weapon in your hand.  Oh, my God.  You're a... You're a coward.  Could that not be used as a weapon?  Couldn't anything be used as a weapon?  Take a walk of shame.  Walk away from me, bitch.  Why are you guys being disorderly?  You guys all took an oath to the Constitution.  You guys are being disorderly.  You're being disorderly, bro.  You're being disorderly.  All of you are breaking the law.  All of you are breaking the law.  You have 10 minutes to fill it out, sir.  You know what?  You have 10 minutes to turn in your gun right now.  Turn in your gun to your colleague.  Turn in your gun.  Turn in your gun.  You can't come back.  You think you own this fucking place?  Yeah, you'd have to.  You're being disorderly.  You're being disorderly.  You're an idiot.  okay thank you.  yeah i know.  yeah i know i'm agreeing with you.  okay great.  so um good good because you took an oath before god and your countrymen to protect our rights.  we have the right right here in a public building to freedom of press right and you're just shitting on a freedom of press that makes you a tyrant.  okay a tyrant right now.  get out of my face.  okay get out of my face.  i've been state you walk away get that stupid smile off your face and walk away now.  walk away now.  no walk away now walk away.

You came over and approached me.  Walk away.  You came over here to shit on my cops.  You're being disordered.  Like a coward.  Like a coward.  Because you don't have the man.  Again, you took another step forward.  Yeah, I did.  And guess what?  You don't have the backbone to stand up for your rights.  You're just a follower.  You're a yes man.  You bend over to orders like a little bitch.  Whatever you guys say.  This is whatever I say.  Because I'm your boss.  Okay.  Thank you.  Yes, sir.  Thank you.  Now you're dismissed.  Thank you.  You're a coward.  You're a coward too, buddy.  Dismissed.  You're a coward because you know we have the right to press.  We have the right to press in a public thing.  You took an oath for that.  Why don't you understand?  Why don't you understand?  Why don't you understand?  Is anyone saying they don't understand what you're saying?  You don't fucking understand.  You're telling us we have 10 minutes to leave.  You're telling us 10 minutes.  There's no time.  There's no time limit on our rights.  Where in the Constitution is there a time limit on our rights?  Guess what?  The people that work here.  The people that work here work for us.  So they don't want you here.  Okay.  Until we commit a crime.  See, there are safety.  Please, I would love that.  Okay, so you are here on official business, all right?  Yes.  You need to fill out your public request form.  Okay, let me interrupt you.

The lawful owner.  Who owned this building?  Who owned this building specifically?  You don't know who owns.  That's how stupid you are.  Because we the people own this building.
