            "text": "The insiders are saying, give me it now.  I want off.  I want off the paper exchange.  I want the real thing.  That's going to funnel its way down to the retail market.  Now, of course, any type of an event, whether it be a second wave, whether it be the chaos that comes along with the election or any event is going to exacerbate the retail demand.  But in general, I would say the retail public is always one or two steps behind the big money.  One needs to realize that gold stocks are stocks, and if the stocks go down, the gold stocks will, in the near term, be affected.  The likely policy response to that, of course, quantitative easing, artificially low interest rates, all that kind of stuff, are ultimately good for gold and the gold equities.  The fact is that there's no certainty in life, as far as I'm concerned.  There's a range of probabilities.  And I think the prudent speculator pays attention to the probabilities and positions him or herself according to the probabilities as they see them with a margin for error.  So yes, maintain US dollar liquidity.  Yes, maintain bullion as liquidity too.  If you can afford to invest after you've saved, certainly buy some of the gold equities.  The economy will gradually reopen, but we're not going to reopen back to where we were last February.  We're going to reopen into a new world that's very different from what we left in February, and the changes are going to be intergenerational.  We're talking stuff that's going to last for 30 years.  You're seeing more announcements of companies going straight into liquidation, and that is very economically damaging.  And everybody gets wiped out.  And it's going to take a generation perhaps to try and put these Americans who are going to be out of work back to work, which means it will be a drag on taxpayers.  And that is what concerns me the most, because I think that we're going to have increased social spending for a very, very long time.  And that puts us on a slippery slope to socialism.  We've had a large amount of new debt.  created just in the last few months because the Fed's been there to buy it and because rates are now back at zero, which makes it very cheap to continue to borrow.  That creates this bigger snowball effect going forward, and that creates a situation where we are more ripe for a larger financial crisis than we've seen so far.  So bigger than the financial crisis of 2008, bigger than what the coronavirus pandemic has unleashed.  I think right now silver actually is expanding in terms of its appeal and it goes through cycles.  so it's not like the first time but particularly right now where the better way to invest in it is not to sort of worry about the squeeze per se or what's going on on the financial basis but to literally buy silver.  Like literally people want to invest, buy physical silver coins.  When you put your money in the bank, the bank is the safe custodian of your money whereas legally you are a unsecure creditor to the bank.  So what most don't understand is that when you deposit money in a bank, you legally have given the bank a loan.  The gold-silver ratio, even if it was 80 today, if it really was globally or 70 that we were talking, it would still be higher than the norm for the gold-silver ratio, which often oscillates around 40 or 45 to 1.  And then in terms of the 1980 bull run, actually went down briefly to 15 to 1.  We're in rarefied areas here that normally do not prevail.  And I don't think a person should get hung up on, oh, it's only 78 to 1 now.  I've missed the opportunity and I shouldn't exchange.  They should say, you know, the higher it is, the more gold.  they should feel comfortable exchanging for silver if that's what they're looking for to play that ratio.  But the idea of having it in hand and having the coverage, you should still want to be acquiring it, even if the ratio is considerably lower than what you think gives you your best shot at the big returns.  The destruction of the currency adds another dimension to what we saw in the 1930s, and that is the trashing of personal wealth.  Anyone who has financial assets, anyone who has cash deposits in the banks and all the rest of it is going to lose and lose possibly everything.  the dollar is going to suffer.  the fate of all fiat currencies.  it's backed by nothing.  and now the government is on tilt.  this is a term that poker players use.  i play poker when i can and uh sometimes when a player is on a losing streak he just goes wild doubling down desperately hoping for luck to bail about.  And that's exactly what the U.S.  government's done.  So the cat's out of the bag.  They'll print unlimited numbers of dollars in a hope to keep the old, rotten structure from collapsing.  But it will collapse.  And in the process, they're going to destroy the dollar.  And I already feel, I don't know if you do, you feel people themselves are changing.  I know personally, I don't hardly spend any money because I don't go anywhere.  And I'm I'm sure other people feel the same way.  And so it's like all of a sudden you don't really need anything.  All you want is your freedom.  And that's what scares me, is that is our freedom going to be taken away from us?  It really frightens me.  And on a certain level, on a certain level, you say, no, we've had freedom our whole life.  Happiness changed.  But it's something to consider and think about when you see how is all this central bank madness going to work out.  To us, the best safety we could have is physical gold because whatever happens, you will have a way of having money in your hand.  Yes, there's going to be some sort of action against gold.  There's going to have to be.  I mean, how high does the total debt pile get?  Is it $275 trillion now or something?  What, are you going to go to a quadrillion or something?  I mean, okay.  How high does it get?  before you look at measly gold with 11 trillion total valuation in the world with no counterparty risk?  It's going to go much higher.  And then once it does, it's like it's going to be a problem because it's a truth serum for the overall system.  We know this is what's going to happen.  So while you're still waiting for that to happen, play that.  There's your trade.  And when that's over, there'll be something else to do.  We don't know what it is now, but we don't need to know what it is now.  How much of a plandemic, scandemic hoax or reality.  It doesn't matter from the aspect of what they are gaining, they the powers that be, as far as being able to do a lockdown grid all basically over the planet.  And they're not going to let that crisis go to waste, especially when they've got round two coming.  For the first time in 30 years, we are seeing massive mainstream participation.  Massive.  I never got mainstream participation before, ever.  And now it's very common to have someone say, I've never bought gold before.  I just cashed out the stock market because, remember, those people used to go to the bond market.  They're not going there anymore.  People who are looking to protect their money and their purchasing power and their wealth and their family's safety, they're coming here.  And that's creating way more demand at a period of time when supply is tenuous.  So isn't that kind of what the definition of inflation is?  Far more money chasing fewer and fewer supply.  And that's what's happening, that the mints \u2013 or the distributors are feeding the massive demand.  And that's pushing the price up as more and more people are realizing that safety is found in precious metals.  And I think it will continue.  This is why I'm saying people should be buying right now.  The big money is showing what they're doing.  They're requesting delivery.  They're taking it off the exchange.  And I think you'll see that funnel on down this fall to the retail side where once again, I'm preparing for massive premiums and shortages.  Last time gold really moved, which was the year 2000, it moves from a low of what?  250 bucks to 1900 over 10 years.  So what I was trying to say was not specifically 18 months, but merely that the move was getting started and had some legs.  As to the time, I wouldn't pay too much attention to the date.  I would pay attention to the level of real interest rates.  If you saw the interest rate in the U.S.  10-year treasury at 7% and you saw the underlying rate of inflation at 4%, in other words, if you were getting 300 basis points in real yield, then exit the gold.  I don't think you're going to see that.  In the past, they say, when you get a financial crisis, everybody rushes for dollars.  Not quite true.  What they rush for is dollar liquidity.  And there's a big difference between having dollar liquidity and owning loads and loads of illiquid dollars.  The illiquid dollars are in stocks.  They're in U.S.  treasuries and so on.  They can easily be liquidated.  But think what happens to the securities markets, financial asset values, if you get that sort of selling and the selling being followed through by the dollar itself being sold.  then you can see quite quickly how the pressures are going to be for rising interest rates rather than falling rates.  The record level of loans held by the non-reportables was about 158,000 contracts.  That was recorded on the 24th of March, literally a day or two after the bottom.  So this is smart money.  The smart money is in the non-reportable category.  And they bought the market right at the bottom of that smash.  They are close to record long again, which, if what I say is valid, that this is smart money, tells us that the squeeze is about to enter a new phase.  The feeling that we're on the cusp of something really historic here, which the last couple of weeks kind of gave us a little bit of a sample of what that just might look like.  There are some fascinating things happening right now on the COMEX market that are changing the entire landscape.  couple days ago, was the largest amount of contracts that have ever stood for delivery on the COMEX market.  You're getting the family offices and the high net worth individuals and the big funds.  They're pulling money off the exchange.  This cripples the commercial bank's ability to naked short.  Because if you're naked shorting something and no one's buying it, no one wants it, well, yeah, it's easy to do.  But if you're naked shorting something and everyone's clamoring for it at a period of time when the demand is is far outstripping the available supply.  You're going to have a spiritual experience if all of a sudden things start to move against you.  And I would argue that's exactly what we saw happening last week as the commercial banks were covering.  But I think indeed that we are entering a period of time where you're going to see massive increase in interest from the elite.  And the pulling off of the metal off the exchange to me is very emblematic of where things are going and what the The sophisticated investor's viewpoint is a physical possession of gold right now. ",
