Al Udeed Qatar.  He did, huh?  All right.  Well, let's see what it is.  Ronan, I am so sorry, but there have been quite a few problems happen here and it looks like I will not be able to be home for your birthday this year.  I am so sorry.  I hope you understand that I wouldn't have done anything to be with you.  I was able to get you a special surprise, so I hope this makes up for me not coming home.  I love you with all my heart and have missed you very much, Daddy.  Yay!  Well, open it.  You never know.  It could be some special open.  Go ahead and open it, baby.  Why is there so many boxes?  A note.  What's it say?  All this for a note.  All this for a note.  Surprise.  Surprise?  Daddy!  Daddy!  Daddy!  I missed you!  I love you.  Is this a good surprise?  You see it swells like a sore hair And the night it is aching.  Two lovers lie with no sheets on their bed And the day it is breaking On rainy days, we'd go swimming out On rainy days, swimming in the sand On rainy days, we'd go swimming out In my mind, all the time.  I know that's not enough.  If the sky can cry, there must be some way back for love and only love.  Can you knock on it?  It could be.  Hello?  Daddy!  Daddy!  Daddy!  Daddy!  Daddy!  Daddy!  We won't let you back to sleep.  You kept awake dreaming someone else's dream.  Coffee is cold, but it will get you through.  Compromise, there's nothing new to you.  Let's see colors that have never been seen.  It's more of a place that no one else would be In my mind all the time.  I know that's not enough.  Well, if the sky can crack There must be some way back To love and only love.  Electrical star Electrical star Electrical star Electrical star Electrical star.  It's hot as hell in this room.  Sure hope the weather will break soon.  There is heaven in the church.  We need the rain to wash away our bad luck.  Well, if the sky can crack, there must be some way back to love and only love.  Electric blue sky.  Electric blue sky.  And they trip the sun And they don't cry And they don't cry.  Oh, my God.  You take care of him, yeah?  You know, he's with the refs.  Go ahead.  Yeah.  Hello?  Brett?  No, I can't believe it.  Oh, buddy.  Oh, buddy.  You didn't have to cry, did you?  It's all right.  Oh, for God's sake. ",
