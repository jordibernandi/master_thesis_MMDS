Oh, I know what you're thinking.  Betty, out of all the millions of fake Christians in America... How did you ever pick the top thousand, much less top one?  Well, this week it was super easy.  He really picked himself.  Because my favorite parable is about the rich Pharisee and the hot pool boy playing naked twister on Jesus's yacht.  Jerry Falwell Jr.  has accomplished what everyone thought was impossible.  making his odious father look good.  i'm kidding that's not remotely possible but like the smug father jerry jr has devoted the past 10 years to scolding the rest of us about the importance of having only a traditional marriage.  a traditional marriage is a apparently, between one woman, one pool boy, one fitness trainer, a dude at a local motel, and a man with his bikini briefs around his ankles who stays in the corner.  Or so he says.  Let's be clear.  The Falwells are not fake Christians because of what they did in bedrooms.  They are fake Christians because of what they said we could not do in ours.  It's the tawdry hypocrisy, not the titillating kink.  That's what Jesus said. ",

            "text": "Yes, Becky Falwell was obsessed with promoting traditional family values.  Like when she'd take the young man she was swinging with, someone the same age as her kids, on family vacations with those same kids.  I'm not judging.  I leave that to the Lord, Becky.  I'm just passing on the verdict.  You know, another thing that makes Jerry a fake Christian, he's a bearer of false witness.  When he knew the pool boy story was about to break, Jerry totally threw his wife under the bus.  How chivalrous.  He piously said he had forgiven her for her indiscretion that he was not involved with.  Not what Jesus told me.  Yes, he was watching, too.  It was, of course, all lies.  And you don't introduce the president to some.  nobody you didn't even know was hooking up with your wife unless you were also hooking up with him.  Another handjob Jerry liked to watch.  And that's the other telling hypocrisy about Jerry Falwell.  In addition to championing traditional family values, Liberty University bans homosexuality.  Liberty's code of conduct, known as the Liberty Way, explicitly forbids sexual relations outside of a biblically ordained marriage between a natural born man and a natural born woman.  Ironically, that would also ban what Jerry and his wife get up to on the regular.  Jerry is publicly against homosexuality and yet apparently his favorite thing to do in the bedroom is to watch hot 20-year-old males get naked and bounce about on a mattress and is willing to pay a lot of money to see it.  The pool boy got a stake in a hostel in Miami.  And the personal trainer got an 18-acre fitness center on property that used to belong to the online diploma mill called Liberty University.  Now people are saying that Donald Trump used all of this salaciousness via Michael Cohen to blackmail Jerry into supporting Donald.  I wouldn't put that past Donald, but it seems wholly unnecessary because Jerry Falwell Jr.  has always been such a colossal fake Christian.  He would always have endorsed the even more colossal fake Christian Donald J. Trump.  Pushed me up against the wall and had his hands all over me and tried to get up my dress again. ",
