            "text": "Hey everyone.  I am so sorry.  I haven't shared a video in so long.  I actually filmed the one you're about to watch in July.  And at the end of it, I apologized if, if it was going to be a while before I could do a video again, because what happened was I moved both my house and my office.  I'm actually still in the process of moving my office right now.  And it just kind of took over my life for quite some time.  So what I've done is I've split up the next chapter, between two videos will be this one and then the next one that I end up uploading there.  I didn't plan that ahead of time.  So there might be a very awkward end to this video.  I'll be sure to let you know when that happens and then we'll pick up again in the next video.  So just wanted to preface this to let you know that's what happened.  And I look forward to getting back into sharing more of you and your gender identity, a guide to discovery with you.  So enjoy.  Hey everybody.  Well, I had to get a new headset because I have a kitten and she chewed on the cord of the other one.  So hopefully this one, uh, works well for the purpose, uh, that we are working towards, which is reading you and your gender identity, a guide to discovery.  And here's the cover backwards, of course.  So we are now on chapter one, which is called, why do I need to find out the truth?  So, This is the beginning, the introduction to the chapter.  Oh, actually, what it starts with is that the first part, there's three stages of the book.  This first stage is called preparation.  So I almost skipped it.  Let's read the introduction to stage one, which is called preparation.  There is an approach to life's challenges that many have used in the past and will continue to use for years to come.  Our life is a story and it is filled with many journeys along the way.  You can apply this concept to the subject matter you'll be exploring in stage one preparation.  The next chapter of your story is unfolding.  You are about to go on a journey to discover your authentic gender identity.  Before you can leave home and set forth on this journey, you must put time in at the beginning to plan ahead for what you're about to embark upon.  Stage one preparation is here to help you get ready for this.  The chapters in this stage will help you in your preparation by showing you how to get confirmation that you should indeed embark upon this gender identity journey, gain motivation by looking at why you need to go on this journey, name, acknowledge, and own the fears that might come up while you're on this journey, gather your magical elixirs to help you move forward successfully on this journey.  At the bottom, I say this inspiration comes from the works of Joseph Campbell as well as C.G.  Young.  All right, chapter one, why do I need to find out the truth?  This book has somehow made its way into your hands.  More than likely, this means you are filled with a variety of emotions concerning your gender identity.  Whether you are experiencing curiosity or pain or something in between, there's no more time to waste.  There's a reason.  you want to take the next step toward understanding your gender identity and this chapter will help you figure out what it is.  First things first.  The first step towards preparation is to be sure that this guidebook is the right tool for you at this particular moment in time.  It comes down to one simple question.  Answer it quickly with your first gut instinct.  No one else has to see it but you.  Here's the question.  Are you uncomfortable with your gender assigned at birth socially, physically, and or mentally?  You answer yes, maybe, or no.  I'll pause so you can answer it.  First answer, OK.  In other words, either when you were born or before you were born, certain people examined your external genitalia and saw a penis, a vagina, or a variation of both for those born intersex.  Based on this observation, it was declared that your sex was male, female, or intersex.  This subsequently resulted in you being perceived and raised as the gender that corresponds with that assignment of sex.  So if you answered yes or maybe to the question I read, you should keep reading.  All right.  This is the first.  It's like a assignment.  It's a project.  It's a task.  Creating a log line.  Let me say that again.  Creating a log line.  In this section, we will be creating your personal logline to help identify the main reasons you want to answer your gender identity questions as soon as you possibly can.  In film and television, a logline is a brief summary of the story intended to be catchy and memorable.  It's what the movie preview voiceover person says to grab your attention.  The logline usually goes something like this.  The main character's normal everyday life is like this.  Then major event or realization occurs.  and the main character is changed forever because of it in these ways.  Here are a few examples of well-known storylines.  Star Wars.  Luke Skywalker has a quaint, although fairly boring, and uneventful existence at the beginning of the film.  There's no reason for his life to change at all until his family is brutally murdered.  The Hunger Games.  Sure, life sucks for the people in this post-apocalyptic world, including for the eventual hero Katniss Everdeen.  At least she has her mom, her sister, and a cute guy to go hunting with.  Katniss has no idea what the future holds as she becomes the face of the revolution against their tyrannical government.  Orange is the new black.  Piper Chapman is an attractive white upper class, upper middle class gal with a big secret in her past.  Just as she's about to start her new life with her fiance, she's arrested for exactly what she hopes to escape.  While in prison, She realizes how much she has been pretending to be someone she isn't and gains true freedom through reaching new depths of self-awareness.  So this is a good time to get out your pen and paper or if you're typing because I have a question for you.  Think of your favorite film, book, or TV show and see if this same storyline structure can be found in it.  What story are you thinking of?  How would you describe its logline?  So this would be a good place for you to pause and write down the answer to this question.  I'm going to move along, but you should definitely pause for however long you need to do that. ",
