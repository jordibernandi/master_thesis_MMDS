            "text": "Good afternoon, people watching the 65 again.  The gospel, it is so important that you know the gospel.  First Corinthians 15, one through four, that Christ died for our sins, was buried and rose again on the third day, according to scripture.  We are saved by grace through faith in Christ alone.  This just came out not even eight minutes ago off of Now the End Begins.  I'm gonna say this before I read this article.  The peace deal that was made January 28th, I don't think it was what we thought it was for.  I think it was for a time like right now.  I'm gonna read this article to you.  Jared Kushner makes shock announcement that Israel has agreed to the creation of a Palestinian state by process of division of the land.  The president laid out his vision for peace in January of this year and this is the first map ever agreed to by one of the parties publicly put on in a peace negotiation.  We got Israel to agree to negotiate on the basis of the process of division.  They agreed to the map and agreed to move forward on a Palestinian state.  This was a major breakthrough that changed the view of a lot of people in the region about Israel's seriousness to actually make concessions to resolve this long-standing conflict, Kushner said.  Adding the countries in the region also questioned by the Palestinian Authority boycotted the economic conference in Bahrain.  There is a generous offer of a state policy and an exchange of territories, and we offer the Palestinian a return to the table, he said.  Now, this just came out.  Okay, we're now off.  It starts off.  We're now off to the races, as the old saying goes.  Jared Kushner today said that Israel has finally agreed to give up land to create a Palestinian state.  Kushner ever used wording that was very much in line with Joel 3, where God warns against dividing his holy land of Israel.  Kushner proudly stated that we got Israel to agree, we got Israel to agreed to negotiate on the basis of the process of division.  If that did not just make you go, wow, then there's something wrong with you.  You should be looking up right now.  let's listen to the words of the prophet Joel.  it says for behold in these days in that time when I shall bring again the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem I will also gather all the nations and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat and will plead with them there for my people and for my heritage Israel whom they have scattered among the nations and parted my land.  that's in Joel 3 1 through 2. now this is This is huge, as Trump says.  It's been a crazy year, crazy month, but the last four days have been absolutely dizzying.  Story after story, unprecedented peace treaties in the Middle East involving Israel and the Muslims can only be leading you in one direction.  Straight to Daniel 9 and Isaiah 28.  As we have shown you in recent articles on Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, prophecy is coming to light nearly faster than we can count on it.  I'm trying to keep up here, guys.  This is what we've been telling you for quite some time and you're watching it all begin to come to pass as soon as the man of sin is officially installed according to 2 Thessalonians 2.  We fly up and are out of here on flight 777.  The Titus 213 Airlines.  We are close to that now.  Don't give up your boarding pass for that blessed hope.  Okay, it goes on.  This is all over Israeli news, it looks like.  It says here... There is a generous offer of state to state, of state to state, and exchange of territories, and we offer the Palestinians a return to the table.  When asked how the U.S.  would make certain that Israel does not unilaterally annex any territory, Gushner said, we build a very trusting relationship with Israel.  Trump is committed to holding them accountable to it, and Israel has agreed with us that they will not move forward without our consent.  We do not plan to give our consent for some time as right now the focus has been getting this new peace agreement implemented.  We really want to get as much interchange between Israel and the United Arab Emirates as possible and we really want Israel to focus on creating new relationships with new alliances.  That land is land right now that Israel, quite frankly, controls.  It's Israel's who are living there.  It's not going anywhere.  There shouldn't be any urgency to apply Israel law.  So we believe they will stick to their agreement.  I'm going to link this article in the description box and you read it for yourself.  So anything else come up, I'll let you know.  Thank you. ",
