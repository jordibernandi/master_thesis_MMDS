But let me tell you, it's not toxic masculinity.  It's not political correctness.  He is making this virus a culture war figure to where it's us versus them.  The way, you know, being polite to people is considered weak.  Now he considers wearing a mask and saving your life, your children's life, your mother's life, your parents' life.  He considers that weak right now.  I went into a supermarket nearby the other day and in comes this old guy in his 70s wearing a U.S.  Army hat, a U.S.  Army hat.  And he wears no mask.  And he was like defiant of it.  And I turned around and I am wearing a Navy mask.  And I go, hey, troop, you have to wear a mask.  It's the law.  It's for your protection, not just mine. ",

Malcolm, before you go, let's talk about, real quick, clearly.  Barr and Trump's aim is to try to erase the entire Russia investigation before the election, right?  To try and, first of all, enable them to do it again, which they already are.  But so what Trump's intel chief has promised?  to release the full transcript of Flynn's call to the Russian investigator.  What do you make of Adam Schiff said?  it's clear the administration is selectively declassifying information for purely political purposes and abuse of the classification system.  We need to ensure a transparent and complete public record free of political manipulation.  It's time to declassify the Flynn transcripts.  I just after Barr's memo about the Mueller report.

The Mueller report completely absolved him of everything.  Three weeks later, the Mueller report comes out and essentially says they were all one step below treason, except that they lied and withheld information from us.  As a matter of fact, Donald Trump Jr.  came out yesterday with his stupidity, saying that blue check Democrat journalists and everybody who pushed this false report.  Mueller said he was too stupid to be charged with a crime because he wasn't aware of what the law was, Donald Trump Jr.  They all got a white privilege pass.  I'm sorry.  That's it.
