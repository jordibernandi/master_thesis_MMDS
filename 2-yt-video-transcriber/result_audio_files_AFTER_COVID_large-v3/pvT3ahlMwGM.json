            "text": "some intel, let's kind of see where we are.  I think we're in a really good place.  And I feel like today, in some ways, I got the biggest, greatest amount of pertinent intel for us that we've had on any one day.  And I feel really good about what I can bring to you guys.  Let's first start with Iraq.  Iraq.  Remember we said that Iraq reinstated the dinar last Saturday.  Last Saturday, they reinstated it.  Now, they also revalued the dinar yesterday, Wednesday.  So the revaluation of the Iraqi dinar became official yesterday.  yesterday with a new rate.  Now, I have a window of what the rate is now, okay, between this and this.  It doesn't really matter because right now what happened was, you know, they had it on the website, the cbi.iq I think was the site, and what happened was they were, they kind of were getting hits on it, but they really did not want it to get.  They didn't want it to get hacked.  Okay, so they took it down themselves.  Iraq did this morning at 4.30 in the morning Eastern Daylight Time.  At 4.30, they took it down themselves.  So they really don't want it to be seen by the world yet because Sunday is when Iraq's first day of business is in the Middle East.  They open on Sunday.  It's like our Monday.  Okay.  there, but they'll open, and they'll open.  the ISX, the Iraqi Stock Exchange, opens Sunday also.  And the IQD rate will be visible and tradable through the ISX on starting Sunday.  So we will actually have the new dinar rate on our bank websites Monday morning.  Now, let's talk further.  We've talked about a number of currencies globally being gold-backed, okay, not just our dollar, which is the USN or USTN, United States Treasury Note, but the Iraqi Dinar, the Chinese Yuan, all of these different currencies, okay, are going to be or are already gold-backed.  Now, we believe the gold standard will be introduced at the same time around the globe on Sunday, our time.  Sometimes Sunday, this coming Sunday, we should be getting some form of announcement that we are back on the gold standard and we have a gold-backed dollar, which we call the USTN.  Now, that is going to take place we believe, about the same time or after Iraq has started trading their dinar.  I don't know which is going to be first, but I know that Iraq's gold-backed dinar is also going to be reflected by our gold-backed dollar.  Why do we need it to come out now?  Because you remember, Tuesday... Tuesday night we talked about the decline in oil prices all the way down, all the way down where it crashed.  The oil market crashed all the way down to zero and below zero to minus $37 per barrel.  It had actually dropped to minus $40 and retraced up to negative $37 per barrel.  So as a result of that drop, That precipitated some bank moves that we talked about.  And it also put approximately 23 global banks out of business due to the fact that they were highly leveraged in oil and oil futures, and they just were not able to handle the contracts.  And that knocked them out.  Not here in the  U.S.,  but this was globally.  Okay?  So.  That was what occurred as a result.  Now, it also puts us in a position where no longer do we have the petrodollar with any value to it, and that's what lends us to go to a gold-backed dollar.  And that's what we expect to happen on Sunday.  Now, oil futures for the month of May \u2013 settled in today's trading at $17.50 per barrel.  And that's a really, really much better move, and we should get all the way up by June or July up to $20 to $30 per barrel, and it'll put us in a better position with oil pricing globally.  But I mean, it's just amazing how everything is moving now.  Now, as a result of that crash of the oil market, I told you guys that it released the GCR, and it did in the sense that the Heritage Bond Trust, the Heritage Trust was opened.  It was opened halfway, and funds were pouring out of that, to a number of central banks globally.  And we also know that happened, I can't even remember exactly when, but it was Monday maybe, I think that happened.  So, where do we stand now?  That first half of the Heritage Trust being released covered the Dubai 1 and the Dubai 2 funds, which covered the Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3 payouts.  Our payouts under Tier 4, which we're 4B, but they don't usually use A and B anymore like we do, Tier 4A and B are covered by the second half of the Heritage Trust Fund.  that is set to release at 2.30 in the morning Eastern Daylight Time tomorrow.  Now, the release of those funds also, let's back up one second.  As a result of what's happening now, we had Department of Defense contracts for the trustees of the intermediate funds, the intermediate accounts, okay?  These were, and you know this is CMKX, this is the, what do you call it, the adjudicated settlements and fines and penalties and Indian claims, farm claims, et cetera.  That whole group, that whole group of funds, okay, have finally been given the go-ahead because the contracts have been received in the location that are going to do the payouts by the trustees of those accounts.  They've already received them.  finally, and they will begin starting shortly after 2.30, 3 o'clock in the morning tomorrow morning, paying out the intermediates.  Remember we said on Tuesday the intermediates need to pay out before Tier 4 goes.  And my understanding is they will pay out starting at 2.30 approximate in the morning, Eastern Daylight Time, and they will pay out Friday, Saturday, and Sunday and be complete by Monday morning.  That's what I'm hearing.  I'm going with it.  Let's believe that they will get those all three days and four days, really, if you count, when they're finished by, paid for by Monday morning.  Now, we're looking for a gold-backed dollar to be announced sometime Sunday.  We know the Iraqi dinar is going to have a new rate as it's traded upwards on Sunday in the ISX.  And we know that the dollar, if it's gold-backed and announced, will be very, very strong on Monday.  And we think that everything that we've got with those intermediate groups being paid out will lend itself to us getting started with our Wells Fargo e-mails, over 501,000 e-mails, with the toll-free number on them, those should go out along with the notification to moi, me, at approximately the same time Monday.  We're hearing around lunchtime, maybe slightly after.  And if that's the case and that's good to go, we should start, based on that information, we should start sometime Monday afternoon.  Now, We could start Tuesday, but there's no reason not to start Monday due to the QFS system and the real-time payment system that is in place now.  Because of that, there's no longer the reason not to do something on Monday now.  That has gone away.  Okay, so we're looking very strongly.  for next week starting Monday, possibly Tuesday, but possibly starting Monday afternoon.  I'm just saying.  I'm not calling it, but I'm doing everything I can not to call it because I think the information that we have today is setting us up for everything that we're looking for to begin.  We are in the midst of a paradigm shift.  We're in the midst of a 10-day paradigm shift right now, And we're about five days into it.  We know that we should get started here this next week.  And we know our 800 numbers will be good through the 15th of May.  So don't worry about that running out in April.  We will get to exchange using the toll-free number in the redemption centers through the 15th of May.  The public will go sometime thereafter.  Okay?  So that's really good, and it could be that our gold-backed dollar, the USN, physical currency, the new money, may come out around the 15th.  The theory was that it would come out approximately the time that the public would start.  Now, you're going to have 90 days to spend your fiat dollars, if you have any, or to trade them in at the bank for your new gold-backed USTNs.  Okay, so don't worry about that.  If you have tons and tons of fiat dollars stashed somewhere, it won't be any good after the gold-backed dollar comes out beyond 90 days.  So be thinking about that.  Be thinking where you have all that stuffed in the mattress or out in the yard in the coffee cans or wherever you put it, okay?  Cookie jar.  I have a feeling most of us don't have that luxury right now.  All right.  So that really gives us the idea pretty much of what's going on.  I can tell you that the bond platforms in Monaco, in Hong Kong, in Zurich, or actually Bern, Switzerland, B-E-R-N-E, Bern, are all liquid.  And Miami, too.  They're liquid.  They're good to go.  So that's something that is also good and new for us.  I know that the bill to increase the funding for small businesses, the second A bill is being passed as we speak, or has passed already, and President Trump will sign that into law tonight.  And that's great for our small businesses in the meantime.  They're going to do really well.  On a similar note, you guys know we had tornadoes in southern Oklahoma, in parts of Texas, and even parts of Kansas yesterday.  And I told you last Tuesday that We want to start our Rebuild America program by finding out where those areas are that have been hit in the south last week and yesterday in Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas.  And I understand like 100,000 homes were taken out yesterday, if I heard the numbers right.  And that's a bunch.  And we want to start there with being able to get everybody up to an even keel and and rebuild those homes.  And we want to rebuild them so that they can withstand another storm should it happen.  So we're talking about concrete block, reinforced block with rebar, concrete, whatever.  Whatever system that we use, we want it to be something stable where maybe we have a safe room in the house, but maybe even better, the whole house is a safe room.  You with me?  The whole house.  can withstand super high winds.  That's really where we're going.  That's what we want to do.  I want to work directly in some of these states by getting in touch with these mayors, community leaders, to find out how we can help them rebuild.  That's what we're going to want to do initially before we get going on our nationwide Rebuild America projects.  I'm excited about where we are based on this information today, we have never been here before.  We do have a revalued dinar.  The dinar is not visible on the website now because they took it down on purpose this morning at 4.30 a.m.  Eastern time.  And we're going to end up seeing it basically in the banks on Monday.  So, And I do believe it will trade upwards of where it actually revalued yesterday.  So, don't worry about that.  It's going to be fine.  Dong is so hard to get a rate on the dong, forget it.  But, you know, it'll be trailing the dinar, but not by a whole lot.  It won't be on par, but I think it'll be within 50 cents to a dollar, maybe, of the dinar.  That'll be great.  So, Really, we have what we have.  You guys are ready in terms of if you've been listening to the big call for a while, you have a lot of information.  All right, everybody.  Bob, whenever you're ready. ",
