I mean it was not easy to get to.  But here's the thing.  At the same time, we had been cracking all of the abandoned tube stations, metro stations in London, right?  So we took a map of the tube from 1932 and and we set a map from 2008 on top of it.  And what you see are a bunch of stations that are no longer on the map.  Right, that's your first clue.  So there were like 40 some.  Then we started doing research and we figured out that there's gotta be at least 14 stations that still have like ticket offices or platforms, like there's something there that you could find.  So we started sneaking into the tube to go and find these places.  Like we would wait till the train stopped at two in the morning and then we would like climb up a bridge and get onto the tracks and we'd run through the tunnels.  And we were finding these stations one after another, incredible time capsules.  There were artifacts left behind, posters, like we'd find tickets on the ground that were 40 years old.  I mean, really cool stuff.  A lot of these stations were bombed out during World War II.  Um, but, uh, finding these is like, again, this kind of like, like here's the archeologists in me, right?  Like we were having this visceral connection to history.  We were finding this stuff that was giving us like a real sense of being inside history in material terms.  So we're, we're posting every time we crack one of these stations, we post it on our blogs.  Like, oh, we've, you know, we've cracked Mark Lane, we've cracked down street, we've cracked whatever.  And we're all excited about it.  and like the window is narrowing.  And we get towards the end of the 14 stations and we're starting to think, you know, like the cops are surely watching what we're doing, right?  The British Transport Police and kind of know where we're going to go next because there's only a few stations left.  So we stop posting stuff.  And on Christmas of 2012, we cracked the last station underneath the British Museum, which, like, there's all sorts of cool stories about, like, there was a ghost in here.  It's a haunted station or whatever.  But we did it.  We never got caught.  So for me, this is the end of the research project. ",

I published my first book, Explore Everything, about all of our \u2013 or I hadn't published the book yet actually.  And I fly to Cambodia to work on a totally different research project, right?  Like I'm switching gears.  I'm going to go do something else.  And I fly back from Cambodia via Singapore, and the plane lands at Heathrow.  And, you know, the thing goes off, ding, and you stand up and you get your bags, and then nothing's happening.  And they say, can everyone please sit down again?  I sit down, I look out the plane, and there's cop cars everywhere.  And I'm like, oh, shit.  You know, I came from Singapore.  Someone brought drugs.  I don't know.  There's a terrorist in the plane.  Like, I have no idea what's going on.  And the cops get on the plane, and they're like, 42K, 42K, Dr.  Garrett?  Yeah, you're coming with us.  Okay.  So they cuff me.  They have me like retrieve my bag from the baggage claim and they take me through passport control in handcuffs.  And obviously the UK government's like, yeah, we'll go ahead and keep that passport.  Thank you.  So they eventually charged me with conspiracy to commit criminal damage, right?  Now, what's weird about England is that trespass isn't a criminal offense.  So you can't charge people with trespass unless you're in very specific circumstances.  So they tried out this charge of conspiracy to commit criminal damage because it's about intention.  It's a thought crime.  Like if I text you and I'm like, hey, dude, you know, the bar is closed right now because of COVID.  You want to break in and just like pour ourselves a beer?  And you're like, yeah, let's do it.  Like we've committed conspiracy to commit criminal damage.  Like we've committed to the crime.  So anyway, for years, we're dragged through the British legal system.  And I got trapped in the UK for three years.  They kept my passport, dude.  I was trapped there.  And here's where it gets really weird is that when the plane landed at Singapore, there was a journalist from GQ who was supposed to meet us because we were going to take him into some of this subterranean infrastructure and show him all these spaces.  And he's like, you know, by the time I got out of jail, like 48 hours later, I had all these messages from like, you asshole.  I came, I showed up at the airport and you weren't there and whatever, you know.  And I finally find this guy, Matthew Power.  And he's like, are you serious?  Like you got, because we had timed it to land at the same time.  And he's like, you serious?  You got arrested at that moment?  And he said, what about your house?  I said, I have no idea.  So we go to my house.  And we unlock the door with these keys that the police had given me because they took down my door with a battering ram.  Right.  And then, you know, like put some padlocks on there that they drilled into the door and the doorframe.  And I open it up and my apartment has just been ravaged, right?  Like stuff everywhere.  The mattress is flipped over.  All the cupboards are torn apart.  There's like pieces of the door all over the floor.  And underneath all of it, there was a job contract from the University of Oxford to do a postdoc because I had just finished my PhD.  And the journalist from GQ is like, dude, I can go home right now.  I've got this story.  I don't need to explore anything.  I'm done. ",
