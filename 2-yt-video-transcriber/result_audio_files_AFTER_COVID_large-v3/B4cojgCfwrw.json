            "text": "What came first, illegal immigration or the wall?  The U.S.-Mexico border is the most militarized border in the world, with the exception of the Korean DMZ.  There are over 700 miles of fencing, patrolled by 20,000 Border Patrol agents.  Each year, American taxpayers spend over $4.8 billion on border patrol and another $8.4 billion on immigration and customs enforcement.  Is our southern border really worth all the money and taxes we're pouring into it?  Hello, I'm Dr.  Douglas Massey.  I'm a professor of sociology and public affairs at Princeton University.  I've been the director of the Mexican Migration Project since 1982.  I've been collecting real-time data on what's going on at the border and none of the conclusions I've reached, to my knowledge, have ever been challenged by anyone.  What many Americans might not realize is just how new all of this border security is.  In the early years of our republic, there was no firm borderline, only a fuzzy western frontier.  As the frontier pushed westward, the border between America and its neighbors continued to be blurred.  When the southern border was finalized in the mid-1800s, it was still soft and porous, an invisible line on a map.  that ran through the middle of towns and even houses.  In the early 1900s, labor shortages led many American farmers to begin recruiting field workers from Mexico.  The work was seasonal, though, with workers coming from Mexico for the planting and harvest and then returning to Mexico for the off-season.  Because they only stayed for the harvest, Mexican workers were not considered immigrants and weren't included in early immigration laws that put quotas on other nations.  The US Border Patrol was established in 1924 not to prevent the entry of Mexicans, but to catch Europeans who were trying to get around the quotas at Ellis Island.  During the Second World War, the US government actually encouraged migration through a temporary worker program.  The Bracero Program was created in 1942 and steadily expanded after the war ended.  By the late 1950s, it was recruiting around 450,000 Mexicans per year for temporary labor in the United States.  Everything changed in 1965 when the Bracero Program was ended and numerical limits were put on Mexican immigration for the first time.  Almost overnight, Mexico went from having access to around half a million legal visas to less than 20,000 permanent resident visas and no work visas.  But the demand for agricultural labor didn't go away, and what was now unauthorized or illegal migration rose to fill the gap left by the end of the Becerro program.  Border apprehensions went from 40,000 a year in 1965 to over 1.6 million in 1986.  However, these were still seasonal workers, and the flow was still circular, with 86% of undocumented workers returning home at the end of the season.  In practical terms, little had changed in the Mexican-American migration system.  But in symbolic terms, much had changed.  For now, the majority of migrants were illegal and thus, by definition, considered to be criminals and lawbreakers.  While the demand for seasonal agricultural work stayed the same, what the government did was criminalize its workers.  Reacting to this perceived change, the US government began pouring more and more resources into the Border Patrol.  From 1986 to 2010, the number of uniformed Border Patrol officers increased 5.6 times.  The agency's budget grew by a factor of 17, and hundreds of miles of walls and fencing were constructed around ports of entry.  None of the extra border security did anything to stop border crossings.  During the 1970s and 80s, the odds of a migrant being apprehended while crossing the border was about 1 in 3.  As more resources were poured into the Border Patrol, migrants began crossing in more and more remote parts of the border, and the odds of a migrant being apprehended actually went down for a while.  The diversion of border crossings into remote areas lowered the odds of apprehension.  but it also increased the risk of injury and even death, for in addition to being less populated and less patrolled, these desolate areas were also more dangerous.  Between 1993 and 2010, the number of deaths along the border skyrocketed.  Coyotes and other smugglers moved in to capitalize on the new black market, and border crossing became much more expensive.  In the two decades after 1993, the cost of hiring a coyote to cross the border increased by a factor of 4.6 in real terms.  But the biggest impact of increased border security was that for the first time in the history of Mexican-American migration, the movement of migrants stopped being circular, finding it increasingly difficult and dangerous and expensive to move back and forth across the border for seasonal work.  Migrants began staying in America during the off seasons.  As men stayed longer north of the border, they were increasingly joined by wives and children, transitioning from a seasonal migrant flow to a permanently settled population.  In other words, the effect of restrictive immigration and border policies was the creation of an undocumented population.  Removing the Bracero program made a traditional migratory system illegal.  Building walls in the southern border didn't keep people out, but rather trapped them in.  Since 2007, the number of undocumented migrants in the United States has actually declined, not because of the efforts of Border Patrol, but rather because of an unrelated shift in Mexican migration patterns.  In the last 15 years, more people have moved from the U.S.  to Mexico than from Mexico to the United States.  This shift was started by the 2008 recession, but has been continued by a change in Mexico's age demographics.  People tend to migrate when they're younger.  If they do not move before the age of 30, they're very unlikely to move at all.  In the last 50 years, Mexico's fertility rate has dropped from 7.2 children per woman to 2.1 children per woman.  And the median age of the Mexican population has gone from 16.7 to 29.3, turning Mexico into an aging country.  New undocumented immigrants in recent years have come not from Mexico, but from other countries.  Today, most undocumented immigrants enter the United States legally.  They enter as tourists and overstay their visas.  Border security doesn't affect them.  And yet still, to this day, there are calls to increase Border Patrol staffing, and to build more barriers, and to strengthen our borders.  Why?  No matter which way you stand on the issue, there are better ways to address undocumented migration than a largely symbolic, totally ineffective and extremely expensive border wall. ",
