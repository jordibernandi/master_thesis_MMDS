            "text": "Welcome back.  You're here with Goldberg.  A couple of people wanted me to discuss this subject at length.  I might also do a Black Pill video probably next week on more of a tragic figure.  I just like that subject matter because it gives me a bit more creative freedom and I can enjoy it.  So it's something to consider, at least in terms of analysis.  Today we're going to discuss some of the ideas about how quarantine people are going to make decisions and react in the future.  The first camp theorizes that, you know, maybe it's cold outside.  So you're going to have a new wave of coronial babies.  So ostensibly you'll go to the price club or the Costco with your Costco cash, hand it to a chatter Tyrone, and you'll come home with one of his babies.  And there's a special deal.  You get like a bottle of Purell as well.  So it's something to look forward to.  And then there's the individual who's saying that's a bunch of garbage.  Men and women, you put them together, you force them to essentially cohabitate, and they're just going to resent each other.  And so divorce is going to skyrocket, right?  I do want to quickly note, of course, you got to be careful.  Whenever these stories come out, there's divorce lawyers, there's couch doctors that are trying to make a profit.  So they might just be shilling for their own interests, as most people are doing pretty much 24-7.  In particular, when it comes to the question of the doctors, there was a really famous French thinker, and he had this luscious mane of black curly hair, very striking appearance.  He made the point, which if I'm quoting it correctly, it was like, Peter, you always play psychologist with us.  So that's something to consider.  And on top of that, when it comes to these people who they claim they have the knowledge, there's two types.  So there's the individuals who will shell out thousands of dollars to get a PhD from U California paying Janet Napolitano.  They got the PhD.  They are an expert, right?  And then there's the naturals, the ones who don't need to do all that.  The ones who, you know, they fail to get into those programs.  but they claim they're superior to everyone.  And that's what you call an empowered egg sperm.  So you have to be able to differentiate, otherwise you can make a fool of yourself when it comes to the real world.  Just to ensure people aren't too sensitive and, you know, requiring all that kind of lotion and powder, I do want to point out the actual data or suggested ideas we have.  They were saying that in China when people broke the quarantine, it was over.  There were lines at the divorce registration offices.  They quote this lady.  This is from the UK, just so you understand.  Her name is Salma Butt.  She's from the Freeman Harris law firm, and she goes, you know, attending school, working, meeting family, friends, and socializing are essential for mental and physical well-being.  Restricting liberties for the benefit of the nation will undoubtedly have a profound effect on families cooped up at home with no outlet to release their frustrations.  They're saying stuff like kids can't even communicate with the parents, nothing new, people just having to stick on their smartphones at the table.  Again, not much of a fresh development there.  But it's true, there was a classic quote, I want to say Kant or Nietzsche, or maybe it was actually that traditional Islamic scholar who went by the name of Eros, as far as the Europeans were concerned.  He said something attuned to familiarity breeds chlamydia, distance breeds fem cells.  So just understand the context of what we're discussing so you don't get all, you know, gummed up and angry because you didn't realize what was coming.  This is one of the reasons I kind of disagree with traditional conservatives and that's, they'll talk about how, well, if you just took away women's rights, put them in the house, it would be fine.  But if you read the book by Osama bin Laden's sister-in-law about Saudi Arabia, it's really fascinating because they say, ostensibly these Saudi women, no education, nothing to do, they can't go out of the house without a male escort.  A lot of them would just kind of degenerate, decay.  They'd become fat, lazy.  They had no aspirations.  They would become experts at manipulating their husbands to spend money on them.  But otherwise, you know, you had huge cases of both varieties of, you know, straight affairs and also homosexual affairs, lesbian and gay men, huge in Saudi Arabia, which really shouldn't be surprising when you consider how the society is structured.  So I really believe that any relationship, especially men and women, you both need to have stuff that drives you outside of the fact that you're in a relationship.  If you're one of those people that you've got like the social media platform and all the pictures are of the opposing part of the relationship.  The lesser or it could be the bigger half.  Usually it's the bigger half.  We're talking about, you know, Florida.  We're talking about most suburban areas, Tasty Cake, Whipped Cream, Wendy's, Little Debbie.  You're talking about the bigger half.  If your entire life revolves around that person, the likelihood is, you know, for the woman, she's too clingy.  For the guy, she's not going to respect you because it seems like You're the most valuable thing that he has.  And as much as they want to think that, they don't want that to actually be true because it means that you're not really a high-valued man yourself.  It's sad.  It's a weird logic, but that's how it plays down.  So you need to make sure as a man you have ambitions, that you have things, you have a certain amount of separations.  And women have to have drive too, whether it's in some cases, it's raising kids and others, they have a career of sorts.  You need to have personal autonomy and identity and things you're pursuing throughout life.  You just become bored and boredom is when you just start resenting people.  At least that's what I've seen in many cases.  So just something to think about.  You don't want to, I guess the way that I would put it is this, you know, men, you can love the booty, but you also have to be able to transcend the booty.  Women, if you want to have some kind of distance, just ask him for, you know, we ask him for the credit card or the Bitcoin or the gold or the silver.  I mean, I would say the stock portfolio, but right now it maybe is not a good time.  At any rate, you need to strategize, okay, because we are dangerously approaching a situation where ostensibly women are going to have to step up and make rules and relationships more so than before.  prevent these sorts of catastrophes.  In fact, I was listening to a song recently, and don't get on me if I don't get the lyrics correctly.  I'm just trying to understand them.  It's very hard because they've got the techno going on, the auto-tune, they talk really fast.  I thought they were supposed to speak slowly, but with these songs they talk really fast, so I'm just going to read to you some of the lyrics to give you a sense of where we are.  It goes, so... I got new bowls.  I count them.  One, don't pick up the phone.  You know he's only calling because your husband's alone.  Two, don't let him in.  You know he only wants to be cucked again.  Three, don't be his friend.  You know he's going to make you breakfast in the morning.  And if you're behind him, you ain't getting over him.  So that just gives you a sense of the current state of affairs.  But yeah... make sure your relationships are more than just you having an obsession over that person because you'll find very quickly it becomes boring, especially when you're stuck inside and all you can do is watch Netflix and loathe each other.
