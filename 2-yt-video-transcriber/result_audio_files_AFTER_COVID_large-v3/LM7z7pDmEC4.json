            "text": "On May 25th, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, George Floyd was murdered by a police officer, sparking a wave of protests across the United States against police brutality.  These protests focused particularly on how police violence disproportionately targeted Black Americans, organizing under the slogan, Black Lives Matter.  Police responded to these protests with force, and Cohesion within their own communities used the slogan, Blue Lives Matter.  Although the slogans of Black Lives Matter and Blue Lives Matter have been around for a few years, I wanted to highlight a piece of iconography that has attached itself to the Blue Lives Matter movement.  That's the use of the skull emblem famously worn by the Marvel Comics character, the Punisher.  In the recent protests, we've seen a few examples of cops donning the skull emblem, and Fox News host Sean Hannity can be seen here wearing an American flag variant, displaying his solidarity with cops who use violent oppression.  The symbol has been popular among police officers and military personnel over the last 20 years, but I want to go back a little further discussing the character who made the symbol popular, and how it bled into police and military cultures.  Created by Jerry Conway, John Romita  Sr.,  and Ross Andrew, The Punisher's first appearance was back in 1974 in Amazing Spider-Man number 129, in which The Punisher was tricked by a villain named The Jackal into hunting Spider-Man.  Over the years, we would learn that The Punisher was a former Marine, Frank Castle, who began a one-man war against criminals after his family was gunned down by the mob.  Unlike the superheroes of the Marvel and DC universe, Punisher was known for branding a certain lethal kind of justice.  Whereas Spider-Man would leave criminals in a handy web sack for the police, the Punisher would leave the bullet-riddled corpses of his victims to be picked up in body bags.  Although he first appeared in the 1970s, it wouldn't be until the 1980s when the Punisher really took off, when he starred in his first miniseries.  It proved so successful that within a few years, there were three ongoing Punisher comics and a series of one-shots, Between the years 1991 and 1993, The Punisher was appearing in not just his own title, but also guest starring in at least one other non-Punisher Marvel comic every month.  His popularity particularly spoke to readers in military service, and you would even find letters from military personnel on the back of Punisher comics, often discussing Frank Castle's weapon choice for a particular story.  The Punisher's popularity sparked a wave of merchandise in a movie starring Dolph Lundgren.  By 1995, though, the character had lost much of his appeal, leading to all three of his titles being cancelled.  There were a few attempts to revive him, including a very weird story where he was an angel hunting demons, but it wasn't until writer Garth Ennis got his hands on the characters in the 2000 story Welcome Back Frank that brought the character back into prominence, leading to a very well-received ongoing Max series, also written by Ennis, two more movies, and eventually a series on Netflix.  Throughout the character's life, the Death Head's skull emblem on his chest has remained a constant.  The skull has many origin stories, and I recommend this video from the NerdSync channel if you want some more details on the many explanations it had.  But in the eyes of the public, much in the same way Superman's S represents Superman, the skull emblem represents the Punisher.  The popularity of the Punisher's emblem in the military is probably best exemplified in the pages of the 2012 autobiography American Sniper, detailing the life of former Navy SEAL Chris Kyle.  This was later dramatized in the 2014 movie by Clint Eastwood, also called American Sniper.  Writing about his four tours in Iraq, spanning 1999 to 2009, Kyle mentions using the Punisher's emblem as a form of psychological warfare, tagging military equipment and buildings throughout Iraq.  We all thought what the Punisher did was cool.  He righted wrongs, he killed bad guys, he made wrongdoers fear him.  That's what we were all about.  So we adopted his symbol, a skull, and made it our own, with some modifications.  We spray-painted it on our Hummers and body armor and our helmets and all our guns, and we spray-painted it on every building or wall we could.  We wanted people to know we're here, and we want to fuck with you.  It was our version of psyops.  You see us?  I'm not sure how effective this was in the effort to win hearts and minds, but it probably had the effect Kyle was expecting it to.  Kyle's unit, calling themselves the Punishers, tried to keep the use of the image exclusive to themselves, but the symbol spread throughout the military, even striking a chord with Iraqi security forces.  The use of the Punisher as a symbol spread to law enforcement at nearly the same time.  One of the earliest examples I found was in 2004 when a group of police officers in Milwaukee started calling themselves the Punishers, violently beating at least one man while the officers were off duty.  They, of course, signified their membership within this group with the Punisher skull.  With the rise of Black Lives Matter activism, the Blue Lives Matter response redesigned the skull emblem by adding an American flag motif to it using blue, white, and black.  the catlettsburg police department operating in a small eastern kentucky town of about twenty five hundred went so far as to add the emblem to their police cars.  the emblems were eventually removed due to backlash from the public.  a police department in solvay new york had a similar idea albeit with smaller decals Although not as warmly endorsed by the police department, the last reporting I could find on this, in 2017, said the emblems would be allowed to stay on police cars, and the St.  Louis Police Union encouraged its members to use the thin blue line variation of the Punisher emblem as the profile pictures for the Facebook accounts of its members.  And there are several other examples of law enforcement donning these Punisher skull emblems in recent protests around the United States, as seen in these photos.  The use of the Punisher symbol seems at odds with the character of the Punisher and the role of the police, the Punisher being a vigilante, and the Punisher's creator, Jerry Conway, has spoken out against the use of the Punisher skull by police officers.  The vigilante antihero is fundamentally a critique of the justice system, an example of social failure.  So when cops put Punisher skulls on their cars or members of the military wear Punisher skull patches, they're basically siding with an enemy of the system.  They are embracing an outlaw mentality.  Whether you think the Punisher is justified or not, whether you admire his code of ethics, he is an outlaw.  He is a criminal.  Police should not be embracing a criminal as their symbol.  A number of individuals in law enforcement and military service have their own reasons as to why they admire the Punisher, though.  Marine Corps veteran Christopher Neff describes his appreciation like this.  Here's a comment from Marine vet Matt Silvatico.  He has a job to do, and he does it.  No political correctness, no rules other than his own.  He just does what needs to be done.  Period.  And another comment from J.D.  Williams, Marine vet and current Sheriff's deputy.  There is no place for a Punisher in society.  That said, some of the qualities that the Punisher has are very admirable.  Strength, tenacity, perseverance, decisiveness.  I don't believe there is any more danger or contradiction than using any other type of fiction and cheering for the flawed protagonist.  Frank is a compelling character because of his black and white view and propensity to go from zero to killing based on his perception and code.  It is fiction.  It's been said that part of the Punisher's appeal to men in service is that he's a former military man himself, though so is Captain America, whose methods tend to be a little less lethal.  There are a number of other comments from these folks that display a variety of similar takes, some worrying, others more thoughtful, but the throughline linking them all together is this idea of moral simplicity, not just being able to identify the bad guys without failure, but also being able to use violence to stop them without endangering any innocent bystanders.  The Punisher is held up as some sort of exemplar of how to mete out justice, brutal, swift, and without missing.  But there's a deeper element to this fantasy that's especially worrying.  One of my favorite Punisher comics is Punisher The End by Garth Ennis and Richard Corbin, published in 2004.  It's part of a line of titles Marvel published, written as hypothetical final stories for a number of its characters.  Most of them weren't great, but The Punishers was pretty damn good.  Frank Castle, now an old man in prison, manages to survive nuclear Armageddon by hiding in the prison bomb shelter.  He eventually gets out and hunts down the shadowy group of elites responsible for the war, who are hiding in a bomb shelter built under the World Trade Center.  When he gets there, he finds out.  the other shelters around the world have imploded as their residents turned on one another, meaning the remnants of the human species, along with the resources to rebuild its civilizations, live in that one shelter.  Instead of letting one evil slip by so humanity can survive, Frank decides to end it all right there, killing the group of elites and then walking off towards Central Park, where his family died, so he can die himself.  a bleak depressing story but one that i think gets to the heart of why the punisher's quest is ultimately a futile one in this story.  if the punisher were a true hero he would have stopped these guys from leading the world to nuclear war in the first place.  but he only exists to punish them after the fact.  There's one quote from the writer of this story, Garth Ennis, whose work probably most strongly defines the Punisher, that speaks to what drives the character.  Frank's time as a Marine is vital to understanding his character and the environment he came from.  His three tours of duty give him military experience, but he comes to see war as the answer to all of his problems.  While a war can end, Frank's one-man war on crime never will, for all the power the Punisher has, being so good at finding guilty people and murdering them, he's powerless to make the world a better place.  His violence creates the illusion of power and control over a society, but the very fantasy of the Punisher is submission to the idea that society can't be changed, that crime will always exist, and the most we can hope for is someone who's especially good at ending those who do it.  As a slightly more optimistic person, I would argue that social changes can improve society in a way that makes crime a less compelling choice.  But the Punisher never considers that.  He's not there to make society a better place, he's just there to punish bad guys.  And the idea of someone in law enforcement or the military thinking similarly, submitting to the idea that society or the world can never improve, and that their role in society is to merely dole out punishment to wrongdoers, is a frightening thought.  It seems less surprising to me that there are police officers treating communities as though they are inherently criminal, as if crime is endemic to them, and that they have to consider themselves, as some officers wearing the Punisher emblem put it, the line between life and death for the public.  This type of rhetoric is repeated often by spokespeople for the police, who choose to portray them as this thin barrier between the madness of crime and violence, as if that wave of crime or violence were an inevitable factor of life.  In a recent 2019 comic, we saw the Punisher confront police using his emblem on one of their squad cars, and his response is to rip it off and tell them to idolize Captain America instead.  There are echoes of this in the Welcome Home Frank storyline as well, where he's greeted by murderous vigilantes who want to follow in his footsteps, and he responds by murdering them.  The Punisher doesn't want to be a role model, and he doesn't want to work with others.  He's submitted to the path he's on, but he doesn't want anyone else to make the same mistake.  For all his physical strength, Frank is a broken man who is deeply damaged, unable to free himself of this path of violence.  that is the only way he seems able to define himself.  Although the Punisher himself can't reach out of a comic book and tear up these symbols in person, Disney and Marvel have shown some litigiousness in the past, suing gun manufacturers and right-wing militias that have tried to use the Punisher emblem in their iconography and advertisements.  But so far they've been unusually restrained when it comes to police departments using their intellectual property.  One explanation I've read is that since it's a trademark, and no actual trade or commercial activity is being performed by the police, it's harder to engage in any sort of legal action.  That doesn't explain why they can't go after the many distributors and manufacturers of the decals, shirts, and hats using the logo, though.  The Punisher's creator, Jerry Conway, has voiced support for the legal action online, and most recently started working with black artists to create new versions of the Punisher's skull emblem that support Black Lives Matter, in an effort to reclaim the symbol.  The shirts created raise money for Black Lives Matter Los Angeles.  I don't think that cops wearing the Punisher emblem is the cause of any real problem we see with police violence.  Rather, it's the symptom of a greater problem, one that involves not only reshaping how policing works in communities, but building better communities where crime is a less desirable option.  Some simpler short-term goals I've seen proposed include demilitarizing police, greater accountability for police in general, and training that focuses less on how to murder people and more on de-escalating conflicts.  Or we could apparently disband the police right away and replace them with other groups that serve a similar function.  I'm very curious to see what happens in Minneapolis following its recent decision, and hopefully they can find a way to provide safety for its citizens that's actually constructive and helpful to the community, and not creating an organization that feels as though it can act violently towards citizens without repercussions.  Of course, justice is still required whenever a cop murders an innocent person, and I don't think anyone is suggesting we turn a blind eye to a non-cop doing the same thing.  But these will never solve the real structural problems that lead to things like this happening in the first place.  If we think of ourselves as alone in society, maybe being the Punisher seems like the only real option.  But working together has, can, and will make the world a better place for all of us.  Now you're seeing the credits go up the screen, and these are the patrons who help finance videos like these ones.  And if you're considering becoming a patron, I would ask that you instead consider donating money to Black Lives Matter, or buy one of those cool Black Lives Matter t-shirts that Jerry Conway is using to help reclaim the Punisher symbol.  I've included a few links below to worthy organizations that you should check out.  Also, if you can afford to give anything right now, I highly recommend checking out the link for Black Lives Matter below because it includes a number of ways you can help the movement without having to offer any sort of financial compensation.  If it isn't already clear, I very much support the protesters and everything they're doing, and I dearly hope that some constructive options and real solutions can come out of these waves of protests, because it's absolutely heartbreaking to see not just what happened to George Floyd, but the many, many others who have faced similar violence at the hands of police officers.  Thank you, everyone, for watching. ",
