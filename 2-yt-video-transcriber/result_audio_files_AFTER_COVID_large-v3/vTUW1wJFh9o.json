Construction of the sacred temple vessels and our museum, where these vessels have been seen by millions of visitors from all around the world.  For 33 years, the Temple Institute has been teaching about the Holy Temple, its crucial role in the redemption and spiritual uplift of all mankind, its beauty, its grandeur, its glory, and God's loving embrace of all humanity.

Their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be lovingly accepted upon my altar, for my house shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples.  It is our mission to bring the promise of the Holy Temple to the world and to bring the people of the world to the dream and to the reality of the building of the Third Holy Temple.
