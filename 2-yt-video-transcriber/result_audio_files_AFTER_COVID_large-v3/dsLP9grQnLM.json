            "text": "Once again, we continue on our four-day theme fueled by a prophecy by Clay Nash, a major prophet connected to Dutch Sheets.  This so encouraged me as I shared yesterday.  This man, Clay, dreamed, and in the dream, four liberals were spinning four blue plates on sticks above their heads.  They were mocking and laughing how they were about to serve the nation a blue plate special.  The president told an assistant to get some great sharpshooters.  Lou Engle was chosen.  This encourages me, and I hope it encourages you because I believe we're all together in this.  And Lew was chosen and positioned himself to shoot each of the plates.  He shot the first plate, and as it fell, it became red in the shape of Georgia.  The second was North Carolina.  the same red into a North Carolina shape, and the third was a Pennsylvania red shape when it was shot, and then Arizona became a red state as the blue plate was shot.  It's an encouraging dream, and I've determined... As I shared a few days ago, that we will not stop as long as there is a chance that a pro-life president can be elected still President Trump.  As long as there is a chance, we will not cease from remitting our most strenuous efforts to see this nation shift.  Otherwise, it means the funding of abortions worldwide when Biden would reverse the Mexico policy, let alone the ideology that you can abort babies up to nine months.  To me, it is absolutely horrifying, even the thought of it.  And that the church, so many in the church tolerate such equivocation in the political realm.  So we are praying for Georgia and we're striking that, shooting that sharpshooter.  We're not just beating the air.  We're pointing our spiritual guns over the state of Georgia and now North Carolina.  Really, for the next few days, these four states, Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Arizona, let's go after this for the sake of the unborn, for the sake of freedom, for the sake of religious freedom.  for the sake of righteousness, for the sake of freedom for parents to educate their children and not be dominated by an education system that will seek to be put in place that will literally teach our little ones the most vile sex education.  Oh my God.  We're in a desperate way, but God is the God of sudden reversals.  And so right now, in Jesus' name, we point our spiritual warfare over Georgia.  over that Senate race in the name of Jesus.  We say, God, let there be a release of favor on those two Senate races for those who are pro-life in the name of Jesus.  Arise, oh God, arise, scatter your enemies, confound the death culture, the spirits of the death culture that are being promoted through those other races ones running for their Senate seats.  In the name of Jesus, loose favor, loose favor on the righteous in Jesus' name.  And Father, I pray this now over North Carolina.  We declare a shift over North Carolina, that great state, that the righteous will rise.  Oh God, that the vote recount We'll go forth and everything that is duplicitous, everything that is hidden will be exposed in Jesus' name.  And that a righteous election will take place in the name of Jesus.  We focus our intercessions on these states right now in the name of Jesus.  And again, we join our prayers.  for Pennsylvania, and for Arizona, that God, in the name of Jesus, that God, there would be a righteous count of the votes, that God, these things even will go to the Supreme Court if there is fraud and has been exposed.  We pray, God, that you would counteract the lower courts.  who refused to listen to truth and true exposure.  God, in the name of Jesus, we are praying for the Supreme Court, that if it goes to the Supreme Court, you would rule over those six judges in Jesus' name, God.  Even John Roberts, God.  We pray for the anointing to be upon Amy Coney Barrett.  that the anointing on her life would influence those five other judges.  They'll come under a spiritual anointing, a divine sway that they maybe wouldn't have done otherwise.  But we ask, Lord, release that Esther anointing to shift the course in Jesus' name and to remove this Haman spirit.  We declare this.  We pray for it in Jesus' name.  Amen. ",
