Okay, before we listen to this expert on Disney princesses talk about why the electoral college is stupid, let me explain how it works.  Every 10 years after the United States Census is conducted, every state is assigned congressional districts based on total population.  A densely populated state like New York currently has 27 congressional districts as well as two US Senate seats.  When you add them together, you get 29 electoral votes.  See, take the 435 congressional seats, 100 senate seats, and the three electoral votes that Washington DC gets for some reason, and you get 538 electoral votes.  To win the presidency, a candidate needs to acquire at least 270 electoral votes. ",
