In this video, we're gonna take a look at the clash between patriots who love their country and Marxist radicals who hate it.

Hundreds of patriots, including the Proud Boys, rose up and defended our nation, our law enforcement, at a rally in downtown Portland.  And things quickly turned violent when Antifa and BLM far-left radicals showed up in a counter demonstration.  Patriots came armed with paintball guns, metal rods, aluminum bats, fireworks, pepper spray, rifles, and handguns.  The Antifa crowd and BLM radicals, which the Washington Post, we're going to get to this in a second, The Washington Post actually referred to them as a left-leaning crowd.  They call the patriots who support our nation and the police a far-right crowd.  Antifa is left-leaning.  I mean, this is fraudulent.  These are our so-called fact-checkers at the Washington Post.  Regardless, we'll get into it in a moment.  The two groups squared off for more than two hours, and it was pretty clear that Antifa and BLM agitators They're just not used to getting this kind of backlash and blowback.  Remember for weeks, Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler sided with the radical left.  He's kept the police from a full crackdown against them, only to have Antifa turn against him and demand his resignation.  And that's when Wheeler turned on them and he finally admitted that Antifa was actively attempting to commit murder and trying to burn down a police station with policemen inside the building.  Now, unfortunately for this leftist mayor, he has a far left district attorney turning against him, this guy Mike Schmidt.  He's a rabid leftist.  He's refusing to prosecute rioters.  that police arrest, which in turn has prompted the state police, who were recently deployed to make up for the gap left by federal officers.  These state police said, screw you both, we're out of here.  The state police have begun leaving Portland, and they're telling the mayor and the district attorney, shove it, because they're completely, they're undermining their capacity to maintain law and order.  And so we've done videos on this emerging civil war from within the left itself.  We're seeing the left versus the left here, a leftist mayor clashing with leftist Antifa thugs.  A leftist mayor clashing with a leftist district attorney and state law enforcement basically saying a pox on all your houses.  We're out of here.  Deal with it yourself.  But now we're finding that patriots are rising up and standing in the gap and they're facing down these Antifa thugs and BLM radicals and telling them, forget it.  You can forget your little Marxist revolution.  We're gonna absolutely crush you and we're gonna come to the cities to do it.  We're not gonna wait for you to come to our suburbs or our exurbs.  We're gonna take the fight to you on your turf right here in Center City, Portland.  Now, in the midst of all this, what's really significant here is that as the two sides began to face each other, The police clearly took sides.  Portland police clearly showed favoritism.  And I don't think you have to be a genius to figure out which side they took.  They clearly took the side of the patriots.  And as a result, the left-wing activists disguised as journalists over at the Washington Post, they were livid.  They were so upset.  Look at this headline.  Portland police stand by as Proud Boys and far-right militias flash guns and brawl with Antifa campers.  counter protesters.  The Washington Post is so, these Marxists are so incensed because remember, As the Washington Post consistently labeled them, the Patriots, they're these far right radicals, right?  They're these hardcore radical right now, gun brandishing, intimidating nuts.  And the Antifa, but well, they're left leaning peaceful protest.  It was nauseating to read, but listen to this from the article.  Cultural Marxist disguises reporters at the post.  They were so upset.  Listen to this quote.  Police said they did not stop the violence, although the event met the criteria to be declared a riot, because too few officers were available to respond and they deemed it too dangerous to intervene.  Officers were tired from responding to a much smaller and less volatile protest that was declared a riot the night before, the bureau said in the statement.  And incident commanders also had concerns that officers would be targeted by the crowd.  Now, of course, who would be doing that?  Who would be targeting police officers?  Those proud boys and patriots that were demonstrating on behalf of law enforcement, back the blue?  Or those who showed up demanding that Portland police be defunded and abolished?  Which of those two were the Portland police concerned about in terms of targeting them?  And then the Post article goes on to say, quote, the decision not to intervene was a striking contrast to police tactics at several left-leaning Black Lives Matter protests in recent weeks.  Officers have consistently declared unlawful assemblies and riots at nighttime protests that have devolved into property damage and projectiles thrown at police, although those events have involved significant property damage at times.  I'm sorry, I'll get through this.  Although those events have involved significant property damage at times, they have not involved firearms or rampant brawling among demonstrators.  They were peaceful riots.  For the last 60 days, there were no firearms.  There was no rampant brawling among these peaceful, loving demonstrators.  These were peaceful riots.  Forget the fact that Chris Fredo Cuomo of CNN said, whoever said that protests were supposed to be peaceful, huh?  Whoever said that, huh?  Well, the Constitution, but never mind.  I don't know how these left wing activists disguised as journalists live with themselves.  I gotta be honest, seriously.  I mean, I'm just floored at the extent to which they constantly attempt to gaslight these riots, these Portland rampages that are imploding through our cities.  They are literally blind to the fact, the inevitable fact, that once you validated civil violence and unrest, you don't get to pick and choose who gets to do it.  Once validated, that's it, man.  Your side, the BLM and Antifa side of things could easily get overwhelmed and pushed back by the rising up of another side.  And all you have is yourselves to blame for validating this kind of civil unrest.  This is precisely what you get.  And it goes on, you're gonna love this.  Check this out again from the same article.  Quote, after the far right groups had cleared out of downtown, members of the left-leaning crowd reconvened in Terry Shrunk Plaza, which is federal property, Federal police declared the gathering an unlawful assembly and drove the protesters out of the plaza, though the crowd had become largely peaceful as the afternoon waned.  I mean, it doesn't get better than this.  The patriots left, they eventually left, they humiliated and crushed Antifa and the BLM thugs, so they left.  And Antifa and all these other leftist agitators then gathered back together to protest.  And the police said, no, go away, go home.  They immediately disbanded them.  They said, get the hell out of here.  Now, what's so fascinating about this Washington Post report is that the only people they interview are from the far left.  They captured the injuries that they suffered, getting beaten by those horrible far right agitators.  They communicated the fear and the frustration, these poor protesters who were just simply standing up for social justice and taking a principled stand against systemic racism.  It's so odd.  I mean, the Washington Post tries to portray this bizarre sympathetic picture of the very groups that are currently destroying Portland.  And so they interview those who were injured in the clash and assaulted by these far right thugs.  They interview other Antifa and BLM activists about what brought them downtown to take a stand.  Not a single word, not one word from anyone on the side of the patriots, not a single one.  So this is why we call them the mainstream Marxist media.  They are literally left wing activists disguised as journalists.  And when you have patriots facing off against the far left, They care only about their far left comrades, right?  They're anti-racism activists, right?  They're heroes standing up against an irredeemable racist system.  Here's what it tells me.  The Washington Post has stopped writing for the general public, right, for readers in general.  They're now explicitly writing for their own fellow leftists.  They aren't even trying to hide it anymore.  They are now so fully immersed in the leftist echo chamber, and they're not even trying in the least to give some semblance of objectivity, right?  Anyone with a brain knows that Portland has not been shut down by left-leaning peaceful protesters.  Everyone knows that.  It's being shut down by a bunch of far left Marxist radicals.  Everyone knows that.  It's just that those on the left view far left Marxist radicals as mainstream.  That's how far left the Washington Post has become.  The bigger issue here, of course, is we are indeed seeing a civil war emerge here.  Now, we've talked about this a number of times on our other videos, but the civil war that's emerging is highly unconventional, right?  It's not a conventional civil war where the military splits into two different sides or anything like that.  It's not a geographic civil war with the North versus the South.  It's not an ideological war involving conservatives versus liberals or the political right versus the political left, formally speaking.  Instead, it appears increasingly the case that we are seeing what is in effect a regional conflict between patriots in America versus Marxists in urban America.  It's increasingly a cultural conflict between the rural culture versus urban culture.  And what we're finding is that rural patriots are taking the fight to urban streets.  They're not waiting for them to come into the suburbs.  They're taking the fight to their own turf into the cities, which is a very, very significant development.  So obviously, we'll be keeping an eye on how things develop here.  But with law enforcement clearly siding with American patriots, it's becoming increasingly clear that BLM and Antifa agitators don't stand a chance.
