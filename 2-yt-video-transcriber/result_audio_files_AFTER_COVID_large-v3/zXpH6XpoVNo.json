            "text": "We're going to talk about alpha seeds and beta mon needs.  A tale as old as time.  And let's see, okay, so the goal for this, guys, the goal here is to expose the trap that women set for men.  This is like their whole game plan.  And it's like one of those little things, you know, never, shh, don't tell anyone this.  Girls would get mad at me if they knew I'm revealing this.  But when you see it for what it is, which I'm guessing a lot of you guys already know what this is, you see it everywhere, and then it just can't work on you anymore.  So the goal of a woman is to get the seed from an alpha man while eventually finding a beta mon man to provide for her security and needs.  That is when they say alpha seed, beta need, think of seed.  What are you gonna plant in something that's gonna grow?  Save the trees.  Oh man, hey, what's up guys?  Alpha slay beta pay.  Hey, you know what?  I don't think I've heard that one before.  I like that.  I love rhymes.  Alpha slay beta pay.  Yeah, that's pretty much more like what the modern dating scene typically is right now.  Okay, so here is... When we talk about the alpha seed, now other people are going to have their own definitions, but this is just kind of how I categorize this.  just because some guys ask, what's a Chad and Tyrone?  We always say Chad and Tyrone.  And that's kind of the typical just alpha male that we talk about that women just can't help but be attracted to.  So here's how I think of The alpha seed.  So I think of the alpha seeds is the men that fulfill her most basic instincts of survival and reproduction.  This is like when women say they don't know why they I don't know why I keep going for the bad guys.  It's like this is like what their most primal desire is in a man that like turns them on.  They just can't help it.  And so a man with good genes for breeding.  because that's going to trigger her at a biological level.  So guys that have really good looks, nice height, because she's going to be looking for things of what can she pass on to her children.  Even if women don't think about this, this is again why us men, we are more attracted typically to the wider hips, the fertile childbearing hips.  Even if we don't necessarily know why, it's because it's going to say, oh, if we wanted to breed with her from a biological level, then she could give more healthy offspring for us.  So this is just like that primal desire.  So another one is like a man that could save her from her enemy.  So this is why women are attracted to guys with muscles or strength.  If you see like MMA fighters or something, a lot of women get really excited after watching a fight like that.  It's like that biological primal desire.  And then another version of the Chad and Tyrone is a man that could raise her social status.  And so if you think of like celebrities, most women would have almost no restraint on wanting to sleep with a celebrity, even if she knew that she wasn't gonna be able to get a kid and take his money or any of that, just because that is going to raise her social status.  From a biological level, it's like this guy has social status, and I kind of think of it back where.  if you were living in tribes or whatever, and if you had a man that had high social status, the worst thing that could have happened in previous days would be for you to be exiled from the tribe.  It'd be really hard to survive when we had way worse conditions.  So a celebrity or some guy with high social status, another one is high social IQ or really high intelligence.  That's another thing that can turn women on kind of in that primal desire.  This is why guys with game that are able to just they know what to say.  They know how to say it.  They're very witty.  They're good with their words.  That is high social intelligence.  And if she had a child with that, just think Alpha Seed.  then her child would most likely thrive because he's gonna have these social characteristics.  Just another one of those little things of, just to give some guys a better idea of like, when we say Chad or Tyrone, it's not always that big six foot five muscular guy, but that is, if a guy had all of these, a Chad or Tyrone, that would be like mega Chad, mega Tyrone.  It'd be like the Power Ranger, the giant Power Ranger, I don't know if you guys have ever even know what Power Rangers are, but, you know, it's like the mega droid that they all come together to form this mega one.  That would be like Mega Chad, Mega Tyrone.  This is a great mindset to have, like the alpha mindset, the Chad and Tyrone mindset.  Masculine men are focused on their purpose and mission in life.  They are not women's therapists, entertainment monkeys, or digital pen pals.  So another thing about the, so here's one thing that some guys don't necessarily understand about Chad and Tyrone.  Some guys think of a guy six foot five and he's got a six pack that no matter what, he's just pulling in all the ladies.  he will definitely turn heads, but some of those guys have such a weak beta mindset that they're such a pleaser that women are not attracted to those guys even though they have the shell of the Chatter Tyrone.  But this right here, and this is like a MGTOW mindset.  This is from a MGTOW Reddit.  Masculine men are focused on their purpose and mission in life, period.  They're not women's therapists, entertainment monkeys, or digital pen pals.  That's just a great piece of wisdom from Chad and Tyrone.  Makes me laugh when betas think they're real men.  Yeah, there's going to be some... What about regular intelligence?  Yeah, Dylan.  Well, regular intelligence is very... a regular intelligence is also attractive to women but if you you have to have also the social intelligence to get you in front of her.  but women are attracted to a an intelligent man especially if you think of like.  uh when some women now are looking to like for sperm donors and all that stuff they want men with high iq.  i mean they're going to pick the best possible you know possible category.  but the guys that have like tons of book smarts but they have very little social skills or social cues they don't understand those they just won't ever be in the proximity.  they won't ever have that proximity chance for a woman to go.  oh man you're very intelligent because they just won't be in that situation.  okay now let's talk a little bit about the beta needs.  so we have Chad and Tyrone.  now we have to the beta guy.  now I had to throw Harry in there.  you guys know I had to throw the name of Harry.  so beta needs I'm going to say Harry and Minkus.  if your name is Harry or Minkus no offense guys.  you know it's just Just like the opposite of Chad and Daron.  Harry and Minkus.  So think of the Betamon needs guy is feeding her non-sexual wants and desires.  A man that will worship her.  He's going to give her security that he won't leave her.  He worships her.  She will never have to worry about that guy leaving when she eventually hits the wall.  A man that can provide financially.  Again, that's going to be security for her, financial security.  It doesn't mean, so this is why a lot of guys that have money, they don't get that natural attraction necessarily, but they're going to get that like beta mon attraction because it's like, ooh, what could he, wow, he could provide.  But that's a non-sexual want in that sense.  And then a man that will be a caring father and husband.  Again, that's going to give her security for her family prospects.  So a guy that's going to listen to her gonna stay home take care of the kids all that stuff just a different way.  it's not the sexual want and desire that really she's tapped into.  it's more of oh okay later on when i settle down it would be nice to have this type of guy and i love this little meme this way.  harry good boy classic all right let's see.  i got another couple memes for this one.  uh Okay, so this is another one.  I posted this one on my Instagram.  It's from BigTelReddit.  Married a divorced 37-year-old woman.  Can you guys guess who this is?  She's not taking her name is okay.  Quit as a royal following her advice.  Moved to Canada to be divorce raped.  The whole painting of a clown that we get to watch.  We get to watch from the outside looking in.
