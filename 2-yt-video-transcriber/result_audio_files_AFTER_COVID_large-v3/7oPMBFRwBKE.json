            "text": "It's a good question, Thea.  And Bailey liked it, too.  If I were in charge, the first thing I do is make sure that everybody is safe.  And that means that our doctors and nurses have all of the masks and gowns they need so they won't catch the virus and they'll be able to stay well and help other people get well.  It also means that people who are out doing work right now, people who are stacking the shelves in the grocery store so there's food there, people who are driving the trucks, people who are driving buses so people can still get along, the people who are cleaning buildings that have to still be open and cleaning our hospitals, that all of those people also have plenty of masks and protective gear so that they don't get sick.  It's also important that they get paid fairly.  You know, they're out there taking a lot of risk and they should be paid extra for doing that.  The other thing I would do is I make sure that people who have lost their jobs during this or whose small businesses have had to close down also have enough money to make sure that they can feed themselves and their kids and pay their rent or their mortgage because this is a hard time for people who get sick, but it's even a hard time for people who don't because some of them are running out of money.  You know, this is the kind of thing we can do together.  And that's how we're supposed to work.  That when times get hard, when there's a crisis, that we reach out and help each other.  Because that's the kind of people we want to be, and that's the kind of country we want to build. ",

Sometimes he'll chase the ball, only sometimes.  And sometimes, you wanna do a little tug of war?  You wanted to do it this morning?  Eh, not now.  And we take long walks together.  And sometimes we just run around and run around and run around in the yard.  But I do think it's important, if you can, to get outside.  And if you can, run and run and run when you're outside.  It just makes you feel better.  And if there are people nearby, remember, always wear your mask.  I'll bet you have lots of fun things that you do, too.  Why don't you send me a video?  Show me what you do.  Great questions today.  And if there's more you want to ask, just let me know.  And we'll do our best to answer them, won't we, Bailey?  Bailey, stay awake.  I guess talking about exercise, just wore him out. ",
