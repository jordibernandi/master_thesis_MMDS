Sergeant Dorsey, you were a 20-year veteran with the department.  You also grew up in South Central.  You know the area intimately.  What was your reaction when you heard about and saw this shooting?

County Sheriff's Department.  and say that I don't condone violence by the police nor against the police, but for the grace of God, there go I. When I saw this, my first reaction was sadness because, listen, there's a lot of chatter on social media about an eye for an eye.  We know that there are reports of internal gangs within the Compton Sheriff's Department, particularly they refer to themselves as the executioner.  And so I wondered aloud if this wasn't maybe retaliation for the failure to hold officers accountable, not only in the Compton Sheriff's Department, but nationally when we see instances of officers using deadly force as a first resort rather than a last resort.

It's cowardly.  It's all those things that people have said.  Listen, violence is wrong no matter who commits that violence.  And what you saw today, and it reminded me of the assassination of two New York City officers just a couple years ago.  Again, another cowardly act that was committed by an individual.  And there's just no justification for it.  I don't care if it's about you know, police reform or anything that has to do with police.  You know, taking another person's life like that, an ambush, is just totally uncalled for. ",

Because there is no comparison at all.  This is a criminal, a thug.  He needs to be apprehended.  He needs to spend the rest of his life in prison, period.  And rewards do help.  I mean, when I was in  D.C.,  we had a standing $25,000 reward for anyone giving information on homicides.  In Philly, we do $20,000.

You know, this could be nothing more in my mind than a distraction from the real problem, from the real concerns, the angst that the black and brown community has down in South Central with regards to his relationship with the police department.  And so while this happened in Compton, and certainly there are issues ongoing with that agency, we don't know if this person, nor the ones who showed up at the hospital and with, you know, total disregard for those that were under care there, shouting things that were contrary to, you know, them getting better, all of that distracts from the conversation that needs to be had.  And listen, let's not pretend that there isn't a reason why folks are upset.  Officers are not being held accountable, police chiefs, sheriffs, and listen, the fish rots from the head.  I'm talking about the president, and it would be nice if he had the same sort of commitment and decisiveness with regards to swift justice in those areas as he does for the person who committed this crime.

There are some people who are just incredibly violent, need to be taken off the streets.  What you saw in that video is an example of one of those people.  There is absolutely no excuse whatsoever for what that individual did.  It had nothing to do with politics, the environment, nothing.  Just a thug with a gun who tried to commit murder.
