            "text": "Official.  Christian, today I'm going to be discussing, are you ready?  And what I mean by that, are you ready for the global reset?  Are you ready for the dinar RV?  Are you ready for the gold back currency?  Are you ready for a possible great economic crash?  But before we get into that, I'd like to thank you guys for your support on the Patreon.  That link is below in the description with all the other support links.  Okay, so are you ready?  And for all of 2019, we've been discussing the Dinar RV.  We've been discussing the coming economic crash with all the debt.  We've been discussing the gold, gold-backed currency, all the gold buying.  And we're at a crossroad right now, especially with everything that's going on in Iraq.  Iraq can't find a pro-Iraq leader.  There's just a lot of turmoil going on with that.  So you got that going on.  In the one video that I discussed dealing with the timeline and I talked about the Denarvy, the gold and the dead and the coming crash, which by the way, if you guys don't know, within six weeks and this is just the Federal Reserve had pumped in six trillion dollars into the markets.  They're desperate.  Things are getting ready to change.  And it's coming to a head.  You've got the gold buying spree.  You've got the debt that's just looming over the whole entire world.  And then you've got all this chaos that's going on in Iraq.  And that's the whole thing.  Are you ready?  Are you ready for these events to take place?  Do you have your plan?  Are you set up?  Are you ready to invest in when this thing occurs?  Are you ready to set yourself up?  and other investments.  I discuss Robinhood a lot, Zion Oil, and have you even thought about even looking at that?  If you go back and look at the videos, there's something there going on with Zion Oil.  Have you even set yourself up for that?  Because when they make that announcement and that stock starts to skyrocket, it's going to be too late.  Some of you are going to be trying to sign up and trying to hurry up and get some, and some of you were going to get in at a dollar, two dollars, but when you could, it got in when it was a little bit cheaper.  Some of you won't get in at all.  Are you ready to buy more currency?  And that's one of the things that I'm, for this year, so far, because when I look at what I know about Diraki Dinar, it's one of the best investments that's out there.  When you really look at things, right, when you, look in your wallet right now we're looking your purse right you might have a couple dollars five dollars ten dollars twenty dollars.  when you look at a five dollar bill and it just using an average rate of you know maybe you paid a thousand dollars which included the shipping and everything for one million dinar.  just saying I'm using the one-to-one right.  so when you look into your wallet you see that five dollar bill that five dollar bill that you got in your wallet.  You need to look at it like this.  That $5 or $10 or that $1 or $2.  that's in your wallet, that $5 represents $5,000 in R, which at the time of the exchange will be worth $5,000 USD.  So every time you look in, when you look in your wallet, that $5, that $10, that $20, it's $5,000, $10,000, $20,000.  And it's very difficult if you really look.  Yes, it's... Bitcoin was probably the best investment that will ever to come.  I don't think you're ever going to ever see an investment like Bitcoin when you can get, I don't know how many, when it was less than a penny, right?  When you can get a whole bunch of Bitcoin just for a dollar.  In my opinion, it's one of the next best things to the Bitcoin investment.  So you got to look at that.  It's hard because when you go, when you know you got food at home and you can cook, And you can go and, you know, go buy this fast food place and spend seven, eight, nine, ten bucks.  You got to look at it as you're spending $10,000.  So we got to start looking like that.  We got to start looking at things like that now because we are, it's like being on the 20-yard line.  In football, it's like being on the 20-yard line in the opposing team end zone, right?  You're 20 yards out.  I believe that's where we are.  I think that's probably the overall best investment right now is that.  That's why I take whatever free stocks I earn, whatever additional money I might make from Robinhood, I put it right back into it.  Are you ready to buy currency?  Many of you, I told you, I use Exchange of America to do my currency purchases.  They have one of the largest choices.  I mean, just so many.  And when that dinar flips and you don't see any of the currencies changing in value yet.  And we've discussed a lot of those different currencies between Benny and currency 365, Pimpy and a few other people.  And how we've talked about different currencies.  Are you even ready to do that?  Some of you are going to miss out because you haven't set yourself up.  So try to really look hard and how you're looking at the finances and how you're investing.  For some of you, maybe it's harder for you to invest, but then you have to also look at where can you cut back on your spending.  I'm talking about like majorly, right?  So what I'm saying is right now at this point, you need to start saving so that you can start investing because we've discussed all these things.  We know it's coming.  This is crunch time.  The beginning of the global currency reset is on the 20-yard line in the opponent's end zone.  I just wanted to give you guys some food for thought on some of those things.  Are you ready?  Are you set up?  Even if you're not investing in cryptocurrency, are you signed up with Coinbase?  Because if you happen to come into something and people are talking about XRP right now, can you even go and invest in it right now?  If one of your friends came to you like, hey, you really need to do this, and you couldn't even do it right away, and things could change in an instant.  That's why a lot of people, when the Dinar RV hits, it's going to be when we wake up that morning.  Whenever that morning when we wake up, things are going to change.  You're not going to have the opportunity to go to any of the Dinar currency sites and purchase.  It's done.  So maybe right now this is the time to reevaluate what you have, what you want to do, what your expenses are, how you want to give, dealing with family members and we discussed all that before in the series that I did about the RV and what to do, what I'm doing after the exchange and the things that I'm thinking about.  Those videos just go back in the history of the videos and you can see that.  So that was just a food for thought how you want to look and maybe start saving to get ready to invest because they're not going to tell you, oh hey, the dinar is going to RV tomorrow.  So you need to make sure that whatever you want and what do you want to get, you got to go get it.  That means if you need to find another part-time job or do Uber or Lyft or do things on the side that you can do so that you can do that because once the dinar RV hits, And we're done with the global currency reset and everybody has everything.  It's done.  Can't get in.  You might be able to get in some of these other things that Kim Clement talked about.  If those things haven't taken off by then.  And sure enough, you'll be watching.  If you miss out or mess up, I am pretty sure you'll be listening very closely to the people who are talking about investments like Currency365.  I'm sure you'll be listening very closely, listening for the next big thing.  And it may not work out for you.  So that's why you need to be ready and you need to be ready.  2020 is going to be an interesting year.  But just make sure that you are ready to do what needs to be done to increase your wealth, to increase what you have.  And you can't do that if you're not ready.  Anyways, and with that being said, Twisted Christian out. ",
