We have Argo Tea, which is hot and cold tea, Mediterranean food, pizza.  We also have burgers and Asian cuisine restaurant as well. ",

We have the game room, which has Xboxes and PlayStations, TVs, pool tables, ping pong tables, board games, super fun stuff.  And we also have an eight-lane bowling alley on our terrace level where halls can come and hang out.  It's a good time.  We have $2 Tuesdays where you can bowl for two bucks.  But on top of everything that we have here in the Student Union, we're also out here on our academic lawn.  We have movie on the lawn, we have lots of spaces where you can play spike ball, throw frisbee, and it's right here on our main campus where all of the academic buildings surround it.  So this is definitely a popular spot on campus that we like to show off. ",
