            "text": "You know, when I tell people that I often retreat to my hymn book, I really mean what I'm saying.  And particularly during this crisis with this virus, I've found myself doing it again and again.  And I've actually surprised myself at how well I'm able to unearth things that have been in there for a very long time.  And one of the hymns that has been a help to me just the last couple of days is a hymn by a lady called Anna Letitia Waring, who was born in the nineteenth century.  She died, I think, at the end of the first decade of the twentieth century.  But the hymn goes like this.  Father, I know that all my life is portioned out for me.  The changes that are sure to come I do not fear to see.  I ask thee for a present mind intent on pleasing thee.  And the thing that I find most challenging about that is the notion that, irrespective of the circumstances, that can be our focus all the time.  And so maybe as I hum it to myself, you'll go look it up, and if you find it, maybe it'll be a help to you as well. ",
