We'll know who our wife is, or our husband was, and we'll understand that relationship of fellowship with them, but not have any physical union.  Therefore, as Christians, those who are raptured out before the tribulation begins, they'll have a glorified body.  They will not have a sexual relationship.  These physical-bodied people, the ones that eat of the tree of life and live forever, they'll be able to have children.  And not only in the kingdom period, that thousand years, but really the kingdom is the front porch of eternity future.  And everything that happens in the kingdom will extend onto eternity future, and these physical-bodied people will be able to have children in eternity future. ",
