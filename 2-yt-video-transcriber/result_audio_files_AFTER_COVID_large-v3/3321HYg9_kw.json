This is a problem for the Trump administration because he is on tape.  Last week, we spent all this time talking about whether anonymous sourcing, even if it was confirmed by multiple outlets, including Fox News, was legitimate.  Now you have the president in his own voice saying, I purposely downplayed it.  I know it's airborne.  I know it's more serious than the flu.  That's a very serious thing that he held back.  And Mike Pence as well was in that briefing on January 28th with Robert O'Brien.  And he didn't tell the American public as well.  They took an hour yesterday in terms of pushing back the press briefing to figure out what they were going to say, and Kayleigh McEnany and team decided on, he didn't want to panic us.  That is a lie.  Donald Trump's entire presidency is based on fear and panic, whether it's migrant caravans, Antifa, anarchists riding on an airplane, or Cory Booker coming to destroy the suburbs.

He knew the severity of the coronavirus back in January, back in February, but he downplayed it intentionally.  He intentionally politicized it.  And that directly led to so many thousands of Americans losing their lives.  And so at the end, they're trying to spin this away from the facts, the truth that Jessica Tarlow was throwing at them.  They're desperate to change it to be about.  why did Bob Woodward have this kind of access to the president of the United States?  What went wrong?  Tucker Carlson last night, try to blame it on the fact that, uh, Lindsey Graham, Senator Lindsey Graham did never really liked Donald Trump in the front.  No, no, none of that matters.  The only thing that matters is that Donald Trump's actions, he is directly responsible for the deaths of almost 195,000 Americans.  Do not let them change the narrative.  I don't care what happens throughout the rest of the day, throughout the rest of the week.  The only thing that we should be discussing when it comes to Donald Trump is the fact that the president of the United States in the year of our Lord, 2020, knew exactly how bad coronavirus was going to be.  And he played it down and politicized it.  And even some contributors on Fox News have had enough. ",
