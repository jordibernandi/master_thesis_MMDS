This is our outpost, right, our boat.  The postmaster general or the general of the post is Great Britain, always has been.  This is an old-school Maasai warfare platform, planetary warfare platform, based upon shipping, postal, and banking wars.  I've explained the shipping to you.  The postal revolves around timelines.  When you're brought into a jail, the timelines kick off, whether it's a federal offense, state offense, or local offense.  Different venues have different timelines, and there are several.  This whole system is enforced in the courts around the world.  This whole system is enforced in the courts, and what they're enforcing is the elemental chart, his strategic metals contract, his styles manual, and the dictionary, which is basically the entire system.  All of us are using the grammatical construct we all use.  All of these contracts and this entire system is enforced in the courts around the world.  Those are called the neutral courts.  That's where the wars are fought in relation to this entire matter.  If you've got a grievance, you go into the courts or the neutral courts and you fight it out.  But this thing is set up to make sure that he always wins, okay?  This entire system is set up so that you never win.  All they look at you as is a piece of cargo, a boat or a vessel that can be harvested, raped, plundered, and pillaged for its good.  So this is the old school Masonic system that these guys have set up, and this is what is being defended on planet Earth, okay?  This whole system belongs to the King of Great Britain, horse-run and defended by the King of Great Britain.  Okay, so he is the postmaster general of the world.  All the countries on planet Earth are... ",

If you get married here in the United States, you're still considered to be married in Russia, China, or Germany.  If you get divorced... You're considered divorced all over the world, right?  Because the courts are all connected.  Everybody's playing this game.  It's a big, old-school Masonic system that they utilize to control the people and run the planet with.  This is the old-school monarchical system that commands and controls the entire planet, or at least is attempting to.  All of the countries on planet Earth are utilizing this sonic warfare platform.  They are all high-ranking masons, all of them.  Not masons in the form of guys who are setting up sidewalks and driveways.  They're not those type of masons.  These masons build governments.  They build them and they defend them.  The contracts that I pointed out that the King of Great Britain has, all the countries have those same contracts.  They all have their own strategic metals contract in place that allows them to print and mint their own coinage based upon their banking system.  Everybody has commodities that they trade around the world with each other, and that's what those banking systems are based upon. ",

I'm honored to welcome each of you here today to the White House Summit on Human Trafficking, honoring the 20th anniversary of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act.  On behalf of the President, thank you for joining me to celebrate this milestone and to recognize the incredible work that has been done across this country to tackle modern-day slavery, pursue justice for victims, and hold traffickers accountable.  Thank you to Attorney General Barr, Secretary Scalia, Secretary Azar, Acting Secretary Wolf, Deputy Secretary Biden for all being here today.  Under your leadership and in coordination with the full of government, the United States is committed to ending human trafficking in all of its grotesque and evil forms. ",

So every single one of us is actually, has been trafficked or is being trafficked in in a different sort of way.  At least we mostly have, or many people have, their dignity and their lifestyle, etc.  But the actual system is you are, even if you're middle-aged or, you know, with running a very good business, you are still, until you gain your life back through the papers, you are still considered a ward of court, okay, as the gentleman who was talking before.

It's tremendously impressive to see what George is doing at the governance level and the senior leadership.  Ken, again, speak more highly of what's going on with the nonprofit community in Atlanta.  But could you speak about why Georgia is stepping forward in your involvement in fighting human trafficking?  Absolutely.  We're so grateful that you got the chance to come down and Ivanka got the chance to come down and see Wellspring.  You know, when presidents make decisions, I cannot thank President Trump enough for what he has done.  And when governors and first ladies make issues, issues, it matters.  And that's what Governor Brian Kemp and our first lady, Marty Kemp, have done before they were even in office.  But the first thing the first lady did was to create the Grace Commission, to bring everybody to the table and say, what are we doing, how can we work together, and where do we go from here?  And we're laser-focused on free issues.  training and awareness, and you've heard some of the nonprofits that we have here, but you've got the state now going to be training all of its employees.  You've got the city of Atlanta focused on this issue.  You have our criminal justice coordinating council.  You've got the nonprofits like Street Grace and Out of Darkness and Wellspring, Rotary International.  that's focused on this issue.  But you also have great corporate partners.  Just Wednesday, I was at Delta where they're training 86,000 employees to be the eyes in the sky.  We've got UPS here.  that's doing truckers against trafficking because they're in every neighborhood around the world.  You've got IHG.  that's focused on the hotel industry.  But we're also focused on restoration.  And I will tell you, Wellspring Living is the gold standard. ",

And it's happening with all of us, but not in this way.  The last video I did, and I ended up with the Delphin Knowledge System, that actually helps you use and understand the universal laws, the universal laws, the laws of the universe, not the laws of the man-made laws.  And by understanding those laws... and connecting your passion to those laws so you can actually achieve so much more.  And why I brought this up as well is because the passion in these individuals' voices is wonderful.  They've chosen, they've made a commitment.  And that's why whatever it is that we find ourselves being drawn towards and feel at home with to help our fellow mankind is exactly where we should be.  I'll just continue with a little bit more of this. ",

So we can partner with our three great U.S.  attorneys, the FBI, our GBI, our DAs, sheriffs, and police chiefs, to make sure that we go after them because, and I'm proud, shared hope, We had a C with Shared Hope a couple of years ago.

Now, what I want to say as well... before we get to the second part of the video, is that also we have got to understand that many of those people in high court positions,  etc.,  and also in the organisations that he mentioned, actually are involved in paedophilia.  Now, that might seem a very gross claim to make, but actually there's a great deal of evidence out there that that is the case.  So the swamp has to be cleaned out, and the first place we need to clean the swamp is ourselves, so that then we can be proactive in following our passion and playing a part in creating a new and wonderful place on Earth in the universe that is not owned by the Vatican, and therefore everyone is slaves.  So cheerio for part two, and there will be part three, which I'm going into in just a few moments. ",
