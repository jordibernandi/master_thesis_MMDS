            "text": "Good damn morning, Americans.  Jericho Green here with you once again, and it is your last day, the final day of the sale of the century.  Your last day for 20% off till midnight tonight.  Offer code LOPAN20.  L-O-P-A-N 20.  All caps.  Get your green gear.  Celebrate this Labor Day.  Happy Labor Day to everyone.  Now, I'm here visiting some very good friends of ours in a place called Marysville, California.  And... I was surprised, I was shocked, I was in awe.  If I had pearls, I would have clutched them.  This is what you call a pro-Trump area.  Now I live down by the coast and I live in a sanctuary city, not by my choosing.  So, where I live, it's Biden-Harris 2020, Trump's a racist, we gotta get that guy out of there.  All these blue-haired, soft handshake, granola-headed dirt fuckers.  I live near Santa Cruz.  Man, that's where they make liberals, man.  You fucking... Silver ponytail Hawaiian shirt Subaru driving motherfuckers.  That's who I live around.  So if you wear or have pro-Trump shit, you can expect sideways looks.  You can expect somebody to talk some shit and a general uneasy feeling.  Not here.  People have Trump pins, bumper stickers on their cars.  They got Trump 2020 flags in their front yard.  They got the little signs, you know, around election time that they stick in your front yard.  People driving around on dirt bikes with Trump 2020 flags, MAGA hats.  This shit's crazy.  I'm at every term.  It's like, what the fuck?  I'm just not used to seeing it.  Where I live, if you see anything pro-Trump, forget.  It's like seeing a unicorn.  Forget that shit.  It's like seeing a purple unicorn with glittery hooves and three balls.  It's that rare.  But up here, it's everywhere.  And it's not just that they support Trump.  It's the attitude that comes along with that.  Small government, leave me the fuck alone, let me go to church and protect my family.  That's it.  That's something we can all get behind.  Let me do what I want to do, keep me safe, and leave me the fuck alone.  We all want some of that.  And with Trump, that's the only way you're going to get it.  The Democrats, come on.  Come on.  Like Biden is perverted says, come on, man.  That poor, senile bastard.  Anyway, man, but being here, it's just a welcoming feeling.  Yes, they're pro-Trump, but they're pro-kindness.  Leave people alone.  Don't push and force your beliefs on people.  And if they don't share your beliefs, well, then you're bad.  You're some kind of phobe or you're some kind of is racist, sexist, some shit that you're not.  That's the difference.  If you have a difference of opinion around people like this, you just have a difference of opinion.  You don't need to be name called or beat up.  It's a nice feeling.  And for it to be in California?  Look, if America had a tank, You know what a taint is?  A taint, I also like to call it the skin bridge.  It's that little piece of skin that connects your genitals to your butthole, right?  California would be at the center of the butthole where all the corn and peanuts come out.  That's what California is.  So for there to be not just a pro-Trump town or city, fucking region up here is amazing.  And it's unseen when you live by the coast, like anywhere.  For some reason, all the stupid-ass weirdos, all the dummies live on the coast, whether it be east or west.  There is hope, people.  There is hope.  I've seen it.  I've seen them.  What movie is that from?  And I'm going to end this with some funny shit.  I'll put a link in the description box of the funny shit I'm going to end this video with.  Some more good news.  So there is a lady called Noor.  Probably wouldn't recognize her by that name, but you will recognize her last name.  Her name is Noor Bin Laden.  We know that name, don't we?  R.I.P.,  you piece of shit.  And the P doesn't stand for peace.  It stands for piss.  So she is the niece of Osama Bin Laden.  And she came out with some comments.  Now, you might be thinking, Bin Laden's niece.  We fucked her uncle up.  We fucked him up bad.  All right?  That SEAL team went in there.  After one of their helicopters crashed.  One of their helicopters crashed when they were doing the entry.  These motherfuckers got up.  dusted themselves off, went up and rang the doorbell and said, boom, boom.  Bin Laden came to the door.  Can I help you?  They said, Mr.  Bin Laden?  He said, yes.  We're here, sir.  We brought you the double tap center mass that you ordered.  Boom, boom.  Him and everybody else who needed some in that compound.  That's amazing.  They sent the double tap crew to see that fool and they got him.  So you would think that we, since we fucked her uncle up and put him out to sea, that she would have negative things to say about Trump.  Wrong.  She said the only person who can save America is Trump.  The only one who can navigate the rough seas of international politics.  is Trump.  She said ISIS flourished under Obama and Biden.  Yes, the same Biden.  they're trying to fuck us with this time, except putting him in the driver's seat.  Instead of him being co-pilot, they're trying to put him in the driver's seat as president.  Huh?  What's that?  Oh, she's 12?  That's too old.  Give me a younger head to sniff.  fucking weirdo.  so she said isis and people of their kind of their ilk flourished under punk ass obama.  and am i still at the mall?  joe biden coming from someone whose uncle was taking the fuck out by america she knows that trump is our only hope for this shit.  We cannot have another lady boy in office.  We cannot have another fucking eunuch in office.  We can't have another Ken doll crotch in office.  What's a Ken doll crotch?  You ever see your sister or somebody play with Barbie and Ken?  Look at his crotch.  Smooth.  There's nothing there.  That's not what we need.  We need somebody who's going to be hardcore and strict on these motherfuckers around the world who want to kill us for our ideals.  She said that.  Nor bin Laden said, hey, I'm going to keep it real.  Trump is who you need to have in there.  Biden is a fucking dummy.  He is a figurehead.  He is a mouthpiece for the corporations that have the real power.  And don't think Biden's going to be there long.  You can call him Lee Majors.  He's a fall guy.  They'll say he's inept.  He's unable to hold office.  Look at all these mental errors he's had on tape.  Get him out of there.  Then you have Kamala.  Huh?  Where are the old dicks?  They'll get her stupid ass out of there because she just goes with the wind.  Whatever puppet, puppeteer has her hand up her ass, manipulating her mouth, she'll say whatever they want him to.  Can't have her in there.  Who's number three?  That's right.  David Lopan, a.k.a Nancy Pelosi, a.k.a.  that liver spotted demon, a.k.a.  it was a shut up.  That's who's going to be running this country.  That's why the rest of the world has their hands clasped together on their knees at the side of their bed every night before they go to sleep, praying that America stays on top, praying that we don't fall apart.  We are the glue for this planet.  Call us Elmers.  The world needs us to succeed.  The world, Craig.  Not just America.  America needs us to succeed first.  But the world needs us to get back on track as well.  We protect a lot of people.  We keep a lot of people from being overrun.  We support a lot of economies.  And we give them a place to come when they want a slice of the American pie.  When they want to live the greatest dream that this floating rock has to offer, that's here.  Anybody who tells you different is a fucking liar.  I'll put a link in the description box to this article.  You can read her words from the New York Post.  Now, let's wrap this shit up with something hilarious.  You guys... Have you guys seen the video of these stupid little punk pussy protesters in Portland?  They had a face-off with the police.  Somebody starts throwing commercial-grade fireworks and Molotov cocktails.  Well, some stupid ass throws a Molotov cocktail, and someone even stupider than him, either he was... where it landed and he got sprayed with the fiery liquid or this dumbass walked through the fiery liquid after it already hit the ground.  I don't know, but this dude's feet catch on fire and this motherfucker starts dancing around trying to put his feet out.  Now, what do you learn in school, boys and girls, if you catch on fire?  Stop, drop, shut them down, open up, shot.  No, that's DMX.  Stop, drop, and roll.  He's dancing around.  And somebody put the music from Footloose to this motherfucker jumping around, dancing around with his feet on fire.  It reminded me.  Because you know I love an 80s movie.  It reminded me of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom when they're going on that little cart down the railroad tracks in the mine.  And they got to stop before they run out of track and fly off the cliff.  So Indiana Jones gets on the front and he puts his feet on the wheels because of course they go to pull the brake and the handle breaks off.  So he puts his feet on the wheels and he stops it.  But from the friction, he gets off and his feet are smoking.  And he starts dancing and saying, water, water.  It reminded me of this fucking idiot getting his feet caught on fire.  Now here is a nice steaming bowl of organic irony for you.  Some of the people that came up to put this fucking dummy out We're cops.  The same cops they're throwing shit at and they want to defund, they still came over here and did their job and put this fucking idiot out.  This human book of matches, they came and put this fucking idiot out, even though a second ago he's over there yelling shit at him and probably throwing shit too.  How about that?  These mean racist cops came over and put the flames out on your fucking feet.  You know what would have been great?  You know what would have been perfect?  If those cops came over there and pissed on him to put his feet out.  That would have been hilarious.  That's what you deserve.  That way we're still helping.  We're still serving the community.  But you're getting what you deserve at the same time.  You get a little bit of punishment.  They need to start feeding those cops asparagus.  So if this happens again, they can pull their dicks out and piss a nice, frothy, pungent urine on these fucking idiots because that's what they deserve.  I saw that shit.  I must have watched it five times in a row when I first saw it.  Because these devils are high stepping and his feet are fully engulfed in flames.  Stop dropping rolls, stupid.  Man, these motherfuckers are so dumb.  But you know what's going to happen?  If you think this is bad, just wait until Trump gets in office.  Because then they can really say, see, I told you.  This is a racist country.  They re-elected Hitler, part two.  Then these cities are really going to fucking burn.  Then you're going to really start seeing these Antifa motherfuckers and these BLM, I'm sorry, CBLM, Certain Black Lives Matter, if we're being honest.  You're going to start seeing these fools laid out.  Because after you've burned the cities, they're going to move to the neighborhoods.  That's where we run into a fucking problem.  That's where I keep my wife and my children.  That's where I keep my babies.  And if you think I'm going to allow you motherfuckers to start smashing these windows, start coming in here and looting, I can't do it.  Me, my 17 and my 21 are going to have something to say about it.  I promise.  It's my home.  I have nowhere else to run.  So I'm not running.  You guys better keep this stupid ass childish tantrum bullshit within downtown.  You start coming out here where people live and have the things they care about, you're going to get fucked up.  So I hope it doesn't come to that.  I hope these fucking children can accept their defeat in November and be an adult about it.  If not, we're going to have a problem.  Now, I'm not going to have a problem other than the fact that it's supposed to be 109 degrees today.  That is terrible.  That is unnecessary.  Like I said, I live by the coast.  Anything over 80, it's unbearable.  And that's all people are talking about when you go out in public.  You see how hot it was yesterday?  It got 85.  Oh my God, they're bringing the dogs and the plants.  Everybody east of here is like, we pray for 85.  Well, 109 is out of my league.  I'm going to be miserable and hot all day.  Thank you very much.  But still, I'm with my family.  I'm with my friends.  So let me get into it.  But you know how it goes.  I try to be done with the left, but they just won't let me.
