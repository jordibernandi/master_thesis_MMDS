This small business owner, he voted back in 2016 for Brexit under the impression that things would improve, that he would have unfettered access to world markets.  But in the video he's going to explain that how most of his customers are in the EU and because of this extra paperwork, because of this extra bureaucracy, his customers in different European countries are going to decide to source their their produce locally and ignore the UK.  Now, he voted for Brexit, but of course he was lied to by the likes of Jacob Priesmaug, Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage. ",

            "text": "Of course it will, because if you have a customer in the EU and they say, well, you know, if I want to import from the UK, it's going to, I need a huge amount of paperwork, but if I source them locally without all these restrictions, even if it's a little bit more expensive, I'd prefer to have the one from the EU.  Now.  Why did Peter vote for Brexit?  Because he was lied to by the likes of Nigel Farage, who are telling him, don't worry, there will be no restrictions.  The EU need us more than we need them.  They're going to give us whatever we want.  We can have our cake and we can eat it too.  Once again, reality strikes.  And as I said before, Nigel Farage, Jacob Rees-Mogg, Boris Johnson, those people are going to be perfectly fine.  The ones who are going to suffer are Peter and his employees.  Now, I don't know what's going to happen, but if Peter loses business, which is probably going to be the case, I'm not going to say that his company is going to close down, but if he loses business, that means he has less revenue, which means he's going to have to lay off people.  And those people are going to be ordinary workers.  Ordinary people are going to suffer the consequences of Brexit.  And I've been saying this for years.  And the Brexiteers respond with project fear.  Stop running down the UK.  You have to believe in Brexit.  I've said before, it's the ordinary people that are going to suffer the consequences.  The people who have been telling the lies are not going to suffer.  Boris Johnson will not be living under a bridge, even though he's crying about his 150,000 pounds a year.  You're going to see more and more of this going forward.  Unfettered access was a huge benefit of being a member of the European Union.  The idea that you can sell your product in any other part of the European Union without any restrictions.  That's gone now.  It's problematic for people selling products out of the UK and it's a problem for companies who want to import products from the UK.  I'm not saying all of these businesses are going to close, but it is going to be more problematic.  And of course, if it's more expensive, if it's problematic, they're going to lay off staff.  And if they lay off staff, as I said, it's going to be ordinary workers.  They're going to take the brunt of this.  You're going to see more stories like this going forward.  This was filmed just before the end of the transition period, back just a few, about a week ago.  But you're going to see more stories like this going forward.  Let me know in the comments section, guys, what you think.  As always, your comments are greatly appreciated.  Thanks a lot. ",
