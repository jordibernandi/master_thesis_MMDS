            "text": "Black lives matter?  Or do they just matter when a white person kills a black person?  Now I'm not racist and what happened to George Floyd is a complete tragedy just so everybody's clear here.  But I'm also a logical person that sees through the bullshit of what's going on in America right now.  Now, I'm gonna stick to the facts in this video.  I'm gonna try to keep my opinions out of it because I think that's what America needs right now.  We need a little bit of logic.  And if any of you liberal fairies disagree with anything that I say, try commenting something with substance instead of saying something like, fuck you, you dumb hick.  God, he is so mean.  In America today, 28% of all black pregnancies end in abortion.  Abortions are the number one killer of black lives in the United States.  Now let me read this so I don't get it wrong, okay?  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, abortion kills more people than HIV, homicide, diabetes, accidents, cancer, and heart disease.  combined African American women comprised of 13.3% of the US population but black women had 36% of all abortions.  so saying black lives matter and then killing off 28% of all of your black pregnancies kind of like being a vegan because you hate when people kill animals and eat them but then secretly you have a cow butchering business in your basement.  Gotta love that logic, right?  No, don't shoot Bambi.  No, don't do it.  Sorry, darling, I got a spot on my wall that's vacant currently.  Gotta make it happen.  So explain that to me.  Do those lives not matter?  Or is that just the easy way out so you don't have to get a good job and take care of them?  So next time Planned Parenthood is packed with people ready to get abortion, should we go out there with signs that say black lives matter?  Because clearly that's the same issue.  Is it not?  Give you a quick story and then I'm done.  Me and my buddy went out to this place just to get out of the house for a little bit, and there was a line there because all of the bars right now have 25% occupancy.  It's fucking stupid because they let 4,000 people go into Walmart, but whatever.  You gotta love that logic again.  But we're sitting there, and this guy cuts me in line.  And the line's pretty long, so I said, hey, motherfucker, get in the back of the line.  We've all been waiting here.  And the first thing that comes out of his mouth is he says, is it because I'm black?  I said, no, motherfucker, it's because you cut in line.  It has nothing to do with your damn skin color.  And then later on that night, I hear him tell one of his friends that that white cracker over there told me to get in the back of the line.  Now, what am I supposed to do if he calls me a cracker or a honky or all this stuff?  Am I supposed to go over there and fight him?  No, I don't give a fuck.  Why am I going to let one person destroy my mindset for the entire night or maybe the entire week and complain about it?  Oh, he's being racist.  Why does it matter so much what someone calls you?  Oh, you can't say the N word because you're not black.  Oh, you can't call him that.  Oh, you can't call him that.  They're words.  They're words.  Why are you gonna give so much weight to words?  Oh, you're that prideful and you have that much of an ego to where if somebody calls you an N-word or whatever it is, you're gonna take out your gun and shoot them?  Okay, have fun in prison.  Be better than that.  If someone calls you that, they're a piece of shit and you don't wanna be around them anyways.  Same goes for any other race calling any other race a derogatory racist term like cracker or honky or spic or any of that shit.  Start being logical with your arguments and then I will be the first one to be a part of whatever it is.  But I'll tell you right now.  It's not gonna be black lives matter.  you're taking America and you're trying to separate it.  If you're a person who says black lives matter, you were saying at one point that they didn't matter.  because if they did matter, why the fuck would you have to say black lives matter if they already mattered?  That's why I don't fucking say it because I never thought that they didn't matter.  I look at a black person the same as I do a white person.  If you're a piece of shit, if you're a fucking asshole, if you don't treat me with respect.  You fucking ass bitch, fuck you and that nigga.  It's the same goes for a black person, a white person, whatever color out there.  I'm not going to fucking like you.  I'm not going to want to talk to you, but it has nothing to do with your skin color.  If you're not a good person, don't expect to get nice people around you or to be treated with respect or any of that shit.  It's fucking common sense, but I feel like the issue is it's all fucking cop out.  When you don't get what you want or you get treated with disrespect or if you cut someone in line and yeah, they stand up for themselves, you go straight to, oh, it's a black issue.  Maybe you're just being a dumbass and someone called you out on it.  You know how much racist shit I get in my comments towards me?  All this dumb hick, all this fucking white trash piece of shit, all this fucking redneck, all this fucking honky, all this shit.  You think I fucking sit in the corner of my room and cry all day long?  Fuck no.  I don't give a shit.  None of that shit puts me down.  One, because I know it's coming.  I know there's fairies out there and little princesses who sit in their room and say, oh, fuck this guy.  He doesn't agree with what we're doing.  So I guess I just got to fucking talk shit and try to put him down.  Come on.  Come on.  So make it about a real issue.  The issue with George Floyd is about police brutality and wrongful killings.  It's not about race.  You didn't hear him call him an N-word.  He wasn't a part of a white supremacist gang.  He wasn't in the Ku Klux Klan.  As far as we know, he wasn't a racist.  And the media wants to take it and say, white cop killed a black man.  Instead of saying this dumbass fucking cop is a piece of shit who killed the guy.  And yeah, he should fucking sit in prison for the rest of his life.  But no, no, no, no.  We got to assume that he's racist because he was black.  If you're a logical person who can look at the media and say, you know what?  That sounds like horseshit.  I'm going to do my own research.  Then yeah, you're one of my people.  John Wayne.  When the storm rolls in, I'm gonna be ready.  Savvy's on my head in case it gets heavy Like a cowboy kicking down doors and taking names John Wayne. ",
