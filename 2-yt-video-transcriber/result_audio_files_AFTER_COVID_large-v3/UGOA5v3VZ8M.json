            "text": "Go, go, go.  A certain man had died in the town of Bethany, and Lazarus was his name.  The Bible says he was a man that Jesus loved.  And his sisters thought it was a shame.  Mary and Mark were long for Jesus here in church To come and raise their brother.  They loved their boy so much But Jesus had a pain Not known to any man That would soon take away their pain.  They was waiting for Jesus to come and save Lazarus.  O Lazarus, pay Lazarus comfort.  When he died, he went away.  The saints of God did stay with him.  In the holy place, they lived beyond the temple.  And there he saw Elijah, Moses, and Samuel in the room.  And all the others camped up in a room.  He turned around and saw old Gideon standing by the door.  He walked up and said, Hey brother, tell me what's this group here for?  Well Gideon said, Well alright, this is testimony tonight.  Have a seat man, cause the meeting's starting soon.  While Mary and Martha just wanted to see little Lazarus.  Oh, Lazarus.  When will little Lazarus come forth?  Moses shook his stick, said, now this meeting come to order.  Can I be a witness for the Lord tonight?  Abraham kicked it off, said, I want you all to know that I knew him.  He gave a child to my very wife.  Isaac waved his head and said, Hey, Daddy, I knew him, too.  Jacob jumped up and said, Amen, Grandpa.  Preach it.  Paul dignified Solomon.  He adjusted his robe and said, I knew him.  He made me so smart, I started to teach it.  Ezekiel said, I knew he missed a wheel within a wheel.  Job said, man, he healed me when I was almost dead.  Sam said, I knew him when some Philistines tried to jump me.  I took a donkey jawbone and busted a few heads.  Shabby back would be shabby now.  Bendigo says, when you were in the fly, my brothers.  Job said, man, he gave me a second chance.  All right.  Daniel cried out, I knew him.  in a hunger den of lions.  The Holy Ghost hit King David, he just started to dance.  Lazarus got so excited, he shouted, hey, I know him too.  Moses put down his stick and said, hey, who's the little kid?  Needless to say, the room got real quiet when Lazarus said, but I knew him in a way that y'all didn't.  See, man, I walked with him and talked with him.  I saw how his teaching was all around.  Those famous tales of compassion, I could actually see.  Man, he used to come over to my house at the church, and my sisters would make him dinner.  Every month, I even supported his ministry.  See, man, I watched him confront the Pharisees.  I was there when he fed the 5,000.  Like a simple, lovely way, just call my name.  Up at the gravestone rolled away with a loud voice.  Jesus started to say, Lazarus.  You see, fellas, it just seemed like yesterday.  I could hear that man standing by.  Lazarus.  As a matter of fact, it seemed like today, guys.  Lazarus.  Excuse me, brothers.  I think I hear him calling me now.  What?  Lazarus.  Jesus.  Jesus.  Jesus.  Jesus.  Jesus.  Jesus.  There is a wind that never stops, and it's going to last forever.  Be that we may. ",
