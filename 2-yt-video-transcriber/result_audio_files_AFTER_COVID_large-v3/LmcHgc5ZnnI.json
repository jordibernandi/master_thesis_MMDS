            "text": "This Friday, The Last of Us Part II will finally come out, and it looks like it'll be the mess we've all expected.  There will be spoilers.  Oh yes, there will be spoilers.  Reviews have come out, and while most of them praise the game as the best thing ever, some reviews are critical, especially when it comes to the story and characters.  Most of the critics mention the same problem.  Everyone sucks.  Not just that old and new characters are portrayed poorly, but that they're all basically bad, irredeemable people.  Kotaku said of the game, quote, As suggested by interviews with creators and its own marketing, The Last of Us 2 is meant to feel very, very bad.  Director Neil Druckmann has touted the game as he described in one video as, quote, a commentary about the cycle of violence in a game that asked, quote, philosophical questions about revenge and consequences.  Pre-release marketing made it clear that the game would be a divisively violent, difficult experience.  Inherently, there's nothing wrong with that.  I actually really like stories that ask difficult moral questions, especially when things don't play out perfectly or have a happy ending.  The world is shit.  It's full of horrible people who do horrible things for petty reasons, and it doesn't seem to take much to make people act like that.  For all the good things people can do, we can very quickly turn to doing pure evil without even thinking about it.  Exploring that, especially in a game, is interesting, which is why we have games that allow you to choose your responses and actions, to decide to be good or bad or in between, and the best versions of those games allow players to have compromised morals.  The problem, as far as I can tell, is that The Last of Us Part II doesn't give you that choice.  It's not so much a game as it is an interactive movie.  So you're watching these characters descend into cruelty and violence with no control over it.  You're moving them along, but it's just to get them through the scene.  If that's the game, then it probably should have never been a game.  It should have been a movie, TV show, novel, or comic book.  And that's because people play games to have fun.  They may enjoy a good story too, I know I do, but ultimately they want good gameplay and an enjoyable experience.  So when you've got someone saying this, you've got a problem.  My playthrough of The Last of Us 2 felt terrible to experience.  Over the course of my 27 hours with the game, it grew to the point of feeling nearly unbearable.  This wasn't because it asked me hard questions about my own capacity for harm or revenge, or pulled some Spec Ops The Line-style moralizing about video game violence.  Despite Druckmann's promised philosophical questions, I never felt like the game asked me anything.  instead it told me brutality repeatedly and louder until by the end i couldn't hear what it was trying to say at all.  characters make hideous irredeemable choices over and over.  everybody suffers physically and emotionally in graphic detail.  this is all intended to prove a point but the only point i got from the game was simply to be required to stare at violence and play through violence and then do it again and more and again and more And that may have been a point.  This is often how violence plays out in real life, and it tends to result in this, quote, You're supposed to feel bad about this, but the game's story has so much more violence, so much more suffering, that plays out over multi-stage quests and long cutscenes and effortful quick-time events, that I lost the ability to care about these everyday acts of carnage, or whether I could have avoided them.  In other words, the more you commit violence, the less you care about it.  It wears you down to the point that only the things you care about, or the people you care about, matter.  Harm coming to anyone else, harm you commit, becomes irrelevant.  And that's a fantastic story to tell, but probably not one.  people want to play.  As Druckmann admitted in a Wired interview, but Druckmann understands from his hours of watching playtesters that not everyone appreciates that.  In fact, he says some players hate the game, and he knows it will be the same for certain fans of The Last of Us out in the wild.  Some of them are not going to like this game, and not like where it goes, and not like what it says or the fate of characters that they love, Druckmann notes.  But I believe as developers like him must learn to tolerate more discomfort.  Quote, I'd rather have people passionately hate it than just be like, yeah, it was okay.  I would think you would rather have people love it than hate it because if they hate it, they won't come back for another game.  Not just another last of a sequel, but any game Druckmann creates.  This is a very weird but common attitude on the far left.  They want intense reactions, positive or negative, so long as they're passionate.  I don't understand that mentality and probably never will.  I don't get the point of making people hate something, especially something they previously loved.  Maybe it's a power thing.  Maybe it's just the nature of the progressive mentality.  I'm not really sure.  I just don't think it's a good idea.  And I can't think of a single example where pissing off the fanbase has ever worked to someone's advantage.  Even then, with all this manufactured melodrama, the least Naughty Dog could do was execute it well.  But apparently, they didn't.  From Vice's review, quote, It's over two dozen hours of spiraling cycles of violence and vengeance, being reminded roughly every hour that the whole endeavor is squalid and cruel.  There's hardly a moment of joy.  it will not eventually curdle.  A truly shocking number of characters that you will come to care about will be gruesomely mutilated or slaughtered or both.  all of it is utterly predictable or if you're feeling charitable tragically faded.  but by the end like the main characters of the last of us two i didn't have much charity left to extend.  the game's operatic tone and length can obscure the simplicity of the themes.  it repeats to exhaustion and its grandiosity is poorly served by a naughty doghouse style that has become less a signature than a straitjacket.  The review goes on to say that the game looks amazing and the gameplay is top notch.  Basically, this is probably the best game Naughty Dog has ever made from a tech perspective.  But story-wise, it's bad.  While there's a lot of story to be told here, it doesn't take long to make crystal clear that our heroes' revenge stories are making them the villains in other people's narratives.  Even before it begins trying to humanize the people you're busy killing, The Last of Us 2 is a game of squalid cruelty.  It's not just the fact that you torture and kill people even as they plead with you to spare them, or the incredibly detailed destruction of faces and bodies that happens with shocking regularity throughout the game.  It's also the growing lack of justification.  Nobody ever reconsiders their quest for vengeance.  Everyone acts under a kind of vindictive compulsion that goes little remarked and unexamined.  Sounds so fun to play.  Like I said before, this would work as a film, TV show, novel, or comic.  In those situations, you get to see these people go deeper and deeper into cruelty, but you're not forced to do it yourself.  A game, however, makes you do this and gives you no options to do anything else.  The game doesn't appear to give you less brutal choices for killing and doesn't let you make any decisions for the characters.  You're forced to be vile, and when you've had enough, there's still another 10 hours to go.  Another problem mentioned in many of these critical reviews are the constant flashbacks.  Not only are they apparently frequent, even having flashbacks within flashbacks, but they're also given out of order.  You meet a character, watch them seek revenge against the character you actually like, and then you're shown the person's motivations in a flashback.  You're not given enough time to learn anything about the character, to develop any concern or interest in them.  You just see their violence, and then get the explanation, sometimes hours later.  This is just poor storytelling.  You can definitely reveal information in modes and flashbacks, but you have to make the character interesting or someone people care about even a little, otherwise the flashback will serve no purpose.  The Japanese IGN review said it best, suggesting that we imagine seeing the scene with Joel's daughter at the end of the game instead of the beginning.  It changes our understanding of Joel as a person.  What the player sees as a wounded man simply becomes a cold and cruel man.  It's nowhere near as powerful when he changes because of that.  Apparently, this happens with many of the characters in the game, which makes the whole experience disjointed.  Added to this is a character switch involving Abby.  That in particular seems to bother several of the reviewers.  One of the problems with these reviews is how little information about the game is actually in them.  There's little mention of the principal characters, and virtually nothing about the plot or the ending.  According to Kotaku, one of the conditions of getting the Early Access review is that they not mention the beginning or the entire second half of the game.  Part of that could be to prevent spoilers, but Kotaku admits that much of what was released in the leaks from April is true.  So I think my point about Sony and Naughty Dog's reaction to the spoilers stands.  If people knew what happened in the game, they wouldn't buy it.  And now we can confirm that.  yes, you do play as Abby for several portions of the game, and Abby does give Joel the full Nicholson in the dumbest way possible.  One angry gamer posted an article listing a number of spoilers and clips from the game.  The gist of the article is that early in the game you play as Abby, and you team up with Joel and his brother Tommy as you flee from Clickers.  Eventually, Joel and Tommy end up with Abby's people, and Abby smashes puny Joel Miller.  We've known that for a while, but what we didn't know was how stupidly this plays out.  At the beginning of the game, Joel is being hunted for killing scientists at the end of the first game.  Joel's been on the run and in hiding since then.  Both Joel and Tommy know people are looking for Joel, so when they meet Abby and finally get away from the clickers, Joel casually tells Abby their names.  Oh, it gets dumber.  He also tells her the location of their hideout.  Why?  Why are you telling this woman this?  Do you know who she is?  Do you know who she's with?  Do you know you can trust her?  No.  So why tell her this information?  Why just casually do this?  Why didn't you just say, I'm Tyler and that's Durden and call it a day?  You tell her your fucking name.  Then it gets worse.  They end up in Abby's hideout with her people, who are all mean mugging Tommy and Joel from the moment they step into the room, which is promptly locked behind them.  That should be a fucking clue, but no.  No.  Tommy gives them his name, and then Joel says his, and it's obvious something's wrong.  He even says something to that effect before Abby shotguns his knee and then pretends she's Tiger Woods' daughter.  so just sit back and bask in the stupidity of joel miller a man so distrusting in the first game that he would never give more than his first name sometimes would even make up names never lowered his guard wouldn't even trust ellie to the point it took her almost to be raped and killed before he cared at all.  That guy, now on the run, casually gives out his name to people he doesn't know, ignores numerous points where Abby and her people act weird around him, lets them lock him in a room, and still gives these people his fucking name.  And that's all in the first two hours of the game, baby.  That's the fucking opening.  Now I get why Naughty Dog wouldn't want anyone to talk about this scene.  Because this scene alone will piss off so many people.  Not because Joel dies, but because of how he dies.  The clusterfuck of stupid that leads to him dying.  It's like this script was written by Fredo.  I'm smart.  I'm smart.  Yeah, let's hide all this information about the game because if people knew what we did, they wouldn't touch it with Abby's dick.  I really don't like the idea that they're trying to trick people into buying something they know gamers will hate, but that appears to be what they're doing.  We'll see what else happens in the game by Friday because the embargoes will be lifted then, and people will be free to talk about the game.  Some will probably beat it within a day, so by the weekend the truth will be out.  Like I said before, I was going to wait until the reviews from people I trusted came out before buying it.  But after all the bullshit Sony and Naughty Dog put me through with the false copyright and DMCA strikes, I have no intention of buying or playing the game.  I don't even want to play the first one anymore.  I can only imagine how people who avoid it the leaks will feel after they go through this apparent beautiful mess of a game.  But what do I know?  I'm just some guy. ",
