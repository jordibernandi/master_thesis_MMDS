And unfortunately, there's also massive tunnels down there too.  So we would never know if they used one of those tunnels to get access to this thing and move it away.  I know there was a very big special that was going to air live about five years ago on one of the science channels.  And then the night that it was supposed to air, it got canceled. ",

We can't duplicate some of the things that they've done just with architecture.  Can't imagine what they've been able to do technologically to be able to even to be able to build that architecture.  So I think that there's a lot of evidence around, including in these ancient texts that talk about flying machines, talk about different types of engines, talk about different types of tools and technologies.  Even in the book of Enoch, it talks about the fact that these beings came down from the sky and taught humans how to build weapons of war and everything else.  So it tells us that these people that came here, some were good, some were bad, But overall, they were highly technologically advanced and they had extensive lifespans, which gave us the illusion that they were immortal.
