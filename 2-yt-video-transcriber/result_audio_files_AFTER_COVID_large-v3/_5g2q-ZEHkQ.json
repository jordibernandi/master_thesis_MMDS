Bro, you see your bro?  What am I doing?  Bro.  I didn't put nothing on camera so you can check it.  It's all good.  What are we doing?  What are we doing?  What are we doing?  Hey, look at my name.  What are we doing?  What are we doing?  I'm waiting for somebody to come.  I'm waiting for somebody to come.  All right, bro.  Tom, stop touching me, bro.  First of all, stop touching me, bro.  No, back up out of here, bro.  Listen to me.  Bro, y'all are hella goofy, bro.  I'm talking to you, and you smack me.  Bro, nobody smacks you, bro.  Why would I smack you?  You didn't.  Why would I smack you?  You didn't.  Why would I smack you?  All right, but why are you grabbing me, though?  Why are you grabbing me?  Why are you grabbing me?  Bro, shut the fuck up.  Quit talking to me, bro.  I ain't got nothing to say to you, bro.  All right.  Nobody's going to get it together.  Like, literally, bro.  Straight up.  Goofy as hell, bro.  Hey, nah, chill out.  You good, bro.  I'm good, bro.  I already know I'm good.  Hey, if they try to shoot me and do some wasted out here right now, bro, you can't be straight.  Nah, take it, bro.  You good, bro.  We'll look down that.  Bro, you see what's going on, though, right?  Hey, you just came over to hang out.  Like, why you guys harassing him?  Hey, did you look my name up already, bro?  Hey, what 24 stand for, too?  Hey, what that stand for?  Is that a gang thing?  Hey, you got 24 on your shit, too?  All right, talk to me, then.  Give me out these fucking cuffs.  Bro, ain't no deep breath.  Ain't no calming down, bro.  Y'all got six cops for no reason over here, bro.  Y'all goofy as hell.  Are you smoking weed and shit, bro?  Suck my dick, nigga.  Suck my fucking dick, nigga.  You bitch ass boy.  You a hoe, nigga.  I'm an attorney.  Fuck him, bro.  Yeah, walk away, pussy.  Hey, if you wasn't with no gun, all you niggas, I'll beat your ass.  Bro.  Yeah, do not threaten him in any way.  Like I said, I'm an attorney.  I'm straight now.  I'm good, bro.  I'm good.  I'm just happy y'all got a show, you know what I'm saying?  It's real nice.  And it's great.  Bro, I know I'm straight.  I ain't do shit but stand right there.  Be goofy as hell.  Bro, I know, bro.  Looking dumb as fuck.  Like, oh, shit.  Bro, exactly.  You think you hella hard, though, huh?  You think you hella hard.  Bro, you hella dumb, bro.  Bro, oh my god, what's his name?  Like, M. Dages?  D-A-G-E-S, bro?  I swear to god, I'm going straight to wherever your supervisor, nigga.  I'm telling, bro.  Straight up, nigga.  You got me fucked up, bro.  And you want to grab my folks and shit, bro?  You think you hella tough, huh?  Pussy.  Man.  Trying to chill, you know?  Hey, good looks.  For the camera.  Appreciate it.  You need a key to get in here.  So, obviously, he can sit down here and wait.  As we pull up, he's already questioning him, like he's in the wrong, like he's not supposed to be here, right?  But, I get that, but that's fine.  But when I pull up and he sees that he's in the wrong, instead of him just being like, okay, you know, you're right, I get it.  Have a good day.  What is he trying to do?  Put his hands on him, first thing!  Who the fuck does that, bro?  Like, come on.  Oh, my God, man.  They make sure they put these cuffs on.  I look tired, too, though.  It's just ridiculous.  You guys want to do some shit like this, bro?  For real, bro.  That shit's fucked up, bro.  Man, y'all part of the problem, too.  Yeah, no, I totally get that, but, bro, there is no reason.  But it's all good.  I already know what it is.  Hey, I'm black as fuck out here.  That's what the issue is.  It's all good.  I get it.  But, you know what I'm saying?  You let niggas do shit like that?  Abuse that car like that?  You know what I'm saying?  Who knows who next?  You feel me?  That's what I'm saying.  I'm just standing here.  You know what I'm saying?  I told him my homie was coming, and he pulled up.  And he still want to beef up on me.  For what?  We looked at my name like 30 minutes ago, bro.  Why am I still here?  I don't got nothing on me.  I'm doing nothing wrong.  I'm being a citizen.  So, you know what I'm saying?  That's why I'm frustrated.  It's hot as hell.  I'm sitting outside for no reason.  You know what I'm saying?  You really don't get it, though.  You don't get it.  It's cool.  I understand that you're frustrated.  I understand that you're being empathetic, and I appreciate that. ",
