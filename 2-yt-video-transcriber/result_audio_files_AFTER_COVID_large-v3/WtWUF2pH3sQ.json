            "text": "Guys, welcome to Better Bachelor.  This is Joker with a face for radio and a voice for print.  So, The Last of Us, a video game that is coming out from, I think it's Naughty Dog is the developer, is so woke, it's so bad, that 70% of the programmers have quit during its making.  Now, I'm going to put in a little quick annotation here, and it has a lot to do with this story, so bear with me.  If you have an opinion and you think it's a good opinion, switch the color of the person you're talking about.  Switch the gender of the person you're talking about.  Put yourself in those shoes.  In other words, if I were to say, and I don't feel this way, but I'm using this as an example.  If I were to say, you know, women are not intelligent enough to vote.  They shouldn't be allowed to vote.  Only men should vote for things.  If you think that's a good statement to say, pause for a moment and reverse it and say, if a woman said, I don't think men should vote, they're not intelligent enough to vote.  If that makes you say, well, that's BS or that's stupid or that's awful thing to say, then you know that your statement is not a good thing to say from your direction.  You're going to at least make 50% of the population upset with you.  So keep that in mind when I read this story and you'll see why.  at the end there's a very pertinent point as to why Naughty Dog and The Last of Us 2 is going off a cliff.  It's gone so woke that it'll just get crashed and burned.  Who they're making this for, I don't know.  Now we know in the United States about 70% of the population is Caucasian.  So if you were to say something bad about the Caucasian people, that is going to instantly take away 70% of your market.  And many of the games are game.  players are male.  So if you were to then make fun of men in your game and paint them as the bad people, you're going to remove them from your game.  And most of the United States as far as religion is Christian.  And if you were to say something bad about Christians, you're going to take them out of the game.  Who are you left selling this game to?  Really nobody.  So let's get into the story and you'll see what I'm talking about.  and why.  this is a game that's going to cost the company a lot of money.  The Last of Us 2 gameplay leak comes from dev that hates its divisiveness.  In other words, this is so bad that a developer said, I'm going to share this with people so they know what's going on before they spend money on the game.  They wanted to let everybody know.  And remember, this is the company they work for.  So you can tell they're really upset about it.  says plenty of spoiler-ridden footage was leaked online by alleged disgruntled Naughty Dog employee.  The Last of Us 2 leaked gameplay footage was supposedly released because they hate the political bias in the game.  Earlier this year, Sony DMCA'd a post that alleged to contain the game's entire plot and If it was a legitimate leak, it proved to be extremely divisive with some of its far left-leaning plot elements.  Now, if you watched, I'll put a, if I can remember, I'll try to put a little flag up above here.  If you watched, I just did HBO's coverage there.  HBO is going to be doing a TV show based on the game, and the TV show has gone right off Woke Central.  I mean, it's gone far, far left.  So this is going to be the game that they're going to be making the TV show about.  And at first it was, I played The Last of Us, the original game.  I thought it was good.  But then when you saw what they were doing, HBO was doing with this, I said, well, why are they twisting the game?  Why are they changing so much of the game to fit this new narrative?  Apparently, they're just following the script that Naughty Dog did in the second season.  game.  So really HBO is just copying what they put forward here.  It says Troy Baker, the voice actor for Joel in the last of a series, later confirmed that the game was super polarizing and it could not be thoroughly enjoyed with a closed mind.  Now, what do they mean by a closed mind?  Maybe having opinions about something or thinking?  I mean, even if you're completely open-minded, I'm open-minded, but if you're going to bash men and you're going to bash Caucasians and you're going to bash this and this and this and this, well, I'm open-minded, but I'm not going to have you just bash me and I'm going to pay you money to play a game that's going to bash me.  That would be stupid.  They say, I want people to go in open-minded to the story and allow Joel and Ellie to tell their story, not the story that people think they want to be told.  If people go in open-minded to this thing, I think they'll have a completely different experience than if they go in closed-minded, Troy Baker told Fandom.  I'm okay with you so far.  I'm an open-minded guy.  I don't mind a little bit of interesting storytelling.  I'm okay with that.  People took the leak with a grain of salt, since at that point this was nothing more than hearsay.  However, the recent Last of Us Part II gameplay leak has pretty much confirmed that.  the original source's claims, which now makes us believe that the Last of Us II plot leak was in fact legitimate.  Now, here they show, it says, Dev hates.  the Last of Us Part II gameplay footage leaks confirm strong alphabet community themes.  And here they have two of the young characters, which are female, being in a romantic relationship.  I'm okay with that.  You still haven't hit anything.  that really strikes a chord.  I mean, yes, it's, what, 2%, 1% of the population.  But if you want to represent that 1% or 2%, hey, that's you.  That's you.  I'm fine.  The anonymous source linked to Naughty Dog Inc.  reached out to tell us the following message regarding the Last of Us 2 gameplay footage leak.  I don't doubt even for a moment that this leak came from the studio.  The Last of Us Part 2 is very divisive, and as you can imagine, some of the team aren't really thrilled to be working on the game.  Well, it must be really divisive if programmers and developers don't want to work on it, because they do all sorts of different themed games.  The source goes on to talk about how stale the work environment has been at Naughty Dog and how many people have had to bite their tongues because cancel culture is very much alive inside of the studio.  Okay, so now we know they're going very far left here.  Okay, so it says many people would agree with me that this has been one of the worst projects they've ever had to work on, one of the developers says.  And it's not just because some people disagree with the plot.  Even though some of the team members are Christians and it doesn't necessarily agree with the game's message, they're also professionals and can put their personality or their personal politics aside to get the job done.  What really sucks about all of this is the working environment.  Okay, so they're saying maybe that's not putting Christians in a good light, but again, even if you are a Christian person, they're saying, hey, I'm still okay to work through this, not a big deal, but the politics in the office.  Not so good.  The team is very much divided on the game and even voicing your concerns on its story will upset certain individuals.  It usually results in said person being called close-minded or even phobic or in some such nonsense.  I've got motorcycles riding around the neighborhood for some reason today, so I apologize for the pauses while they go by.  So they have to bite their tongues of fear of losing their jobs, even careers to an outrage mob.  They continue on.  So can you imagine working in an environment when someone says, hey, I think this is a good idea, and you go, hold on.  Let's look at our demographics.  Maybe this isn't such a good direction to go or this isn't such a good message to send.  And they say to you, oh, you must be phobic or you must be a bad person.  When you can't voice your opinions because it differs from others and the cancel culture comes from you, this is not a place you want to work.  I mean, you're instantly out.  Our source also alleged that with high turnover in staff is because of the reasons mentioned above.  What's really sad is that nobody is allowed to talk about any of this.  Many employees have left Naughty Dog because in-house politics and they are under a strict NDA and absolutely cannot discuss the studio's production practices secrets.  Oops.  They literally put that in the article.  Oops.  So now you're starting to shut down anybody.  Just be a slave.  Just be the hive mind.  Just do as you're told.  Don't question.  Don't come up with creative ideas.  Don't try to change our message on brand here.  Well, that's a good way to get just about everybody involved to quit.  Because, you know, you get into game development so you can use your creativity.  So you can put your artistic touch on things.  And if that's being shamed, well, it gets worse.  Hang with me because it gets worse.  Naughty Dog Inc.  has a turnover rate of 70%.  which skyrocketed around the time The Last of Us Part II went into production.  Our sources claim have been corroborated by a former Naughty Dog animator, Jonathan Cooper, who left them in early October last year.  And you can see here a picture.  It says Naughty Dog dev team 2020 celebrate International Women's Day and trans rights.  And you can see here every one of them.  in this photo is of the women on the staff.  Now, I don't see any blue hair, so that's a good start.  But this is a surprisingly large amount of women for a development staff for a game.  Usually the programmers and the devs are men, just as one of the industries where it's usually men.  Jonathan Cooper alleged that Nick or Neil Druckmann would force him. ",
