I'm a woman hear me roar.  So we are told to do that, to stand up and fight.  And so this is that generation that's coming out in women and it's you hear it in her.  I used to have that.  so I understand that when I was most hurt in a situation it would come out like that.  it would come out as I'm gonna tell you what I have to say and I'm gonna do this and you're not gonna hurt me.  and it was.  it was not real it wasn't.  sincere strength is is being able to be vulnerable and But I didn't know that at the time.
