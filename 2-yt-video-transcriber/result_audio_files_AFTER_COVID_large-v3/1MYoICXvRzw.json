            "text": "It's the way of the crypto warriors, changing our world day by day.  The way of the crypto warriors, can't rely on the bank, there's no way.  Hey guys, vixwayroader.com.  It's your morning horn of Caesar, sip of coffee.  I don't have my camera on.  I started, I forgot to turn on the camera.  You don't need to see my face.  You've seen me before.  Big news this weekend is Warren Buffett buys Hunts Abroad with $6 billion wager on Japanese firms.  What they're not telling you is these are four of the largest silver holders on the planet.  The trading firms in Asia are gigantic dealers in silver.  Gigantic.  And other precious metals and commodities.  This is a silver play, in my opinion.  Itushu, Morabini, Mitsui.  We know Mitsui is big in silver, right?  And there's another one.  I don't remember what it was.  Warren Buffett, with more than $160 billion in cash on hand, has been struggling to find attractively priced assets at the home of the U.S None of this is true.  Buffett is buying all the silver assets he can and gold assets he can in forms that don't really jump out.  Barrick Mining and these four, they call them brokers and trading companies, they're literally asset holding companies.  These companies, if you're going to buy silver and you have all the money in the world, you buy the companies first, you get into the mining companies, then you buy futures and options, then you buy the real thing and just slam the door on everybody.  100% true that Warren Buffett is taking down the criminals in the gold and silver market as laid out on the road to Ruta for the past 10 years.  There you have it.  Let's talk silver now.  Silver's running up 73 cents, which is nice.  We're going to make it run at 30 again.  And when it blows by 30, what's the next stop?  50?  Maybe?  The all-time high is 50, whereas gold has surpassed its all-time high from 1980, blown by it.  It's going to triple it, and silver's got a long way to catch up, a very long way to catch up.  And silver is the most manipulative of all the metals.  But that manipulation is ending, and we're very happy about that.  Very interesting note.  I talked on Saturday's video about the delivery notifications.  We have more delivery notifications today, as expected.  I think it was 6,500 was Friday, and today, which is the first day of actual physical deliveries, is Friday.  1,928.  So that brings us to 8,500.  Again, most of the big shorts that needed to be closed out because they couldn't deliver were closed out on Wednesday and Thursday of last week, as I documented, and huge mega losses from some of these big banks.  But the cool thing about deliveries is you can see who's having to come up with the metal.  And you can tell today.  from Now, the issued is the people issuing the delivery notification.  The stops is the people who have to supply the metal.  And you can see Barclays.  Barclays jumps out at, well, part for customer and part for their home account.  But over 1,000 of these 1,900 come from Barclays Bank.  And the other is Morgan Stanley Bank.  These are part of the criminal short position cabal.  Morgan Stanley, Barclays are the big providers of metal in the Bank of America.  You notice they're all just big banks.  Morgan Stanley is theoretically not a bank, but it's a bank.  It's part of the cabal, part of the market rigors.  They are not happy about this.  They had to find the physical metal.  We don't know what they bought it for.  We don't know if they're turning in metal that their customers hold and they've just gotten a naked short behind it.  We don't know much of anything on this other than, question is, as it moves up, as the price moves up past $29, $30, who is going to be shorting into the rise?  Historically, the big banks short into the rise and slam it down.  All year, they've been taking losses as they do that.  And we believe, according to Ted Butler, and I believe Ted, that they have made a deal.  The banking cabal has made a deal with the DOJ.  DOJ said, hey, we don't want to destroy the entire system, but you have to get out of these markets.  And I think we're going to see some more charges.  We saw the charges against, who was it?  Scotiabank.  I think we're going to see charges against these banks as well.  I mean, you can just literally, you can name them off.  JP Morgan, obviously, that's the big one.  I think it would be sooner rather than later.  I think September, October timeframe rather than next year or something like that.  We're going to see the charges against the JP Morgan traders.  They're going to settle for, I would guess over half a billion dollars.  That's a big number, but it's nothing compared to what they stole from the people.  And they get to keep 700 million of their 1 billion ounces of physical, which is crazy.  But hey, In America, crime pays.  Crime absolutely pays.  You don't have to go to jail.  You just have to pay a little fine if you get caught.  You can bake it into the cost of the deal.  It's an expense.  Big news on Theta.  All you Theta lovers out there, Theta has announced growth plans and staked token use.  So Theta, if you go to the Guardian monitor for Theta, you can see who's got the stakes.  In the validator node right here, Theta Labs has most of the stake coins.  They are removing one of these 32 million coins.  And I got emails, oh, does that mean they're going to sell it and market it and crash the price?  No, that's not what they plan on doing.  That would make no sense for them to do either.  They are, and here's what they say.  And there are some hidden gems in here.  I hope everyone's staying safe during this COVID.  blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And... I'll just read it all.  I hope everyone's staying safe during these uncertain COVID times.  After the last few years of building, it seems that blockchain technology is reaching new heights in 2020.  With tremendous developments in DeFi, two-layer scaling and adoption of BTC as a store of value by prominent businesses and hedge funds.  Theta Network is making great strides in 2020 as well, with multi-BFT consensus going live with our mainnet 2.0, now with more than 500 million Theta staked to the Theta Network.  Remember, that's out of 870 million.  Over half is staked already, and it's going to come close to the whole thing in due time.  Our partnership with Google Cloud, joining as an enterprise validator node, and upcoming integrations with Game Talk Talk, Movie Block, and other video apps and platforms.  Recognition is starting to come from the broader crypto space as well, with Coinbase announcing that Theta is among the projects under consideration for listing.  people to get data in the United States.  It's pretty hard to get data in the United States because the exchanges won't carry it.  And I think that's a huge conspiracy anyway.  But you can swap for it on things like CoinSwitch, but the exchanges don't carry it until Coinbase gets it.  And when Coinbase does get it, they're going to need a lot of data.  They're going to need a lot of data.  So of course, data is going to be... giving or selling, shall I say selling, to Coinbase a hell of a lot of tokens.  That's why Theta Labs knows that there's not many tokens available on the retail market without driving the price to the roof, and Coinbase wouldn't get on board unless they have a bunch of Theta tokens.  So I think this has 50% to do with Coinbase coming on the Theta bandwagon.  Okay, and remember, all these coins are going to be disappearing in validator nodes and in guardian nodes in the G pool, too, and I'll talk about that in a second.  Okay, so it talks about Theta Network.  made great strides in 2020, 500 million stake to the Theta Network, our partnership with Google Cloud joining as an enterprise validator node, and upcoming integrations with Game Talk Talk, Movie Block, blah, blah, blah.  Recognition is starting to come from the broader space.  How far have you read this?  More importantly, With a greater proportion of the world's population staying at home due to COVID, we're seeing tremendous growth with streaming video and all data types.  We're bullish on the demand for Theta Protocol and Platform over the next 12 to 18 months.  Like many other businesses and corporations, we took a comprehensive approach to our expenses beginning in March of this year, anticipating a prolonged economic downturn.  with the help of strategic investment rounds last year from Blockchain Ventures, Samsung Next, Data Labs, is fully funded through 2021.  So they don't have to get rid of these tokens unless it's for strategic purposes.  They don't need the money.  However, we recognize it's the best time, in fact, to accelerate our growth.  Here's the key.  To sign up more enterprise validators.  Those are the big guys, like Coinbase, like Apple.  Like Sony.  Keep an eye out for those names.  They're going to need coins.  And where do they get them?  From Theta.  To bring the largest streaming platforms to Theta.  And this is interesting.  Listen to this.  To 100x our Guardian network.  They want to 100x the Guardian network?  I mean, the Guardian network right now, right here, is at... There's 1,319 guardians, and they want to go 100 times that.  That'd be 130,000 guardian nodes.  That's a pretty robust system.  And the guardian nodes basically keep the validators in check, and the validators are the ones validating the transactions.  That's why data is so much faster than other networks.  Ethereum, for example, blows it away.  All right.  Going on.  Moving on.  And then 1000X, our video band was shared.  Yes, I think the rollout, I mean, Theta obviously still needs to be rolled out.  Samsung's going to put it on all its devices and things like that.  But they're going to need some advertising campaigns to get people to download the node catcher, the Theta node catcher, to share their broadband so they can earn Theta fuel.  So they're going to need money for that.  I think they have it in the budget anyway, but they're getting a lot.  They're selling 32,000 coins.  But here's a hint on timing.  With this in mind, we plan to unstake around 30 million theta.  Now we know from the Guardian monitor right here, there's the stake right here.  Validator took out 32 million from the validator.  That's theta.  Okay, moving on.  So they've already taken $32 million out from our validator node, so they're not going to take any more out after this, at least for a while.  In the coming months, approximately 14% of Data Lab's stake.  Now listen to what it says.  The tokens will be used over the next 12 months as growth capital for the project.  We're going to double down our investments across the board.  We'll be hiring and expanding the Theta team, including R&D and business development to accelerate platform adoption, driving new market initiatives, hiring a new PR firm, funding developments in Theta ecosystem through more Theta hackathons and ecosystem developer groups.  You're going to see Theta commercials all over the place, all over the internet, all over the TV, right when Coinbase offers it.  Perfect timing.  We believe that the timing for this move is now, with blockchain technology momentum running high and Theta leading the way as the most successful video blockchain project.  Our long-term goal is to drive sustainable revenue sources and reduce the protocol's reliance on the core Theta development team to become decentralized, self-sustaining, and self-governing.  That's the beauty of blockchain is the founders can have an out strategy by giving everything to the community.  And where do they get their wealth?  They get their wealth from owning so much.  goddamn theta.  Correct?  So that's where we are.  And I think it's great news.  And the timeframe, especially, they're going to use all these tokens over the next 12 months.  Basically, they're saying, okay, we got Coinbase coming in.  We got Sony coming in as a validator.  We got all this stuff and it's going to happen fast.  And they literally released this on the 27th.  And then they said, over the next two months, we're going to be pulling out the 30 million coins.  And literally, they pulled it out a couple days later, 32 million.  Crazy, crazy, crazy.  I know.  Great time for Theta.  Get your Theta.  Yeah.  You want to get Theta from Road to Rooted?  Go to roadtorooted.com.  And you can join.  We're giving away 50 Theta and 50 Theta Fuel with every private subscription.  No, I cannot sell Theta.  I don't have a license for that.  It's coming to Coinbase.  You can go to coinswitch.io.  There's a couple of them out there that will swap like Ethereum or Litecoin for Theta.  You need $10,000 to start a Guardian node.  And you can use the Gpool Delegate.  delegate.  don't forget the delegate function on gpool and they've gone from 17 million when when i started talking about it a couple months ago to 34 million now and in rising.  why?  because it's good It's always up, always running, and you don't have to keep your computer on running.  I was running a Guardian node for a while, and I was like, every time I had it running on my laptop, and then every time I closed my laptop, I forgot I'm running my Guardian node, so I'd have to reboot the whole blockchain, and it was a pain.  They got it in seven different places, gpool.io.  Go to gpool.io.  You need 10,000 theta.  And one key is when you do it, it won't show up on their network if you use the delegate.  So you're not going to see it on their network.  Just go back to your wallet.  You'll see zero in the amount of your theta.  But if you go to the staked area, it'll show you how much is staked.  Just keep that in mind because people freak out.  Oh, my God.  I put it in the gpool delegate, but it's not showing up.  It is.  It's just not showing up on their site.  It's not hooked up to do that.  But you're still earning theta fuel, and it'll be getting added to your wallet, the wallet you staked from.  And if anything happens to Gpool, you can unstake your coins and it comes right back to the same wallet.  So you're not giving up wallet access when you do this.  All right, so go to rogeroo.com, join today, and you get 50 theta and 50 theta fuel.  And this baby's going to run really fast between now and the end of the year.  So hang on to your hats.  This is Big Swear.  I'll talk to you guys later. ",
