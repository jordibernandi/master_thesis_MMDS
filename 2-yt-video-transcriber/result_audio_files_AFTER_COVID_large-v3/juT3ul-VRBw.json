The thing that many men should understand is, there are a lot less women out there that are wife material and that want to be wives.  So in other words, this in part is why many men find it so difficult to date nowadays, let alone marry a woman.  Run for your lives men.  Because the point is, it's not all on the men.  Then again, as a man, it's misogynistic to speak on the women you're supposed to be dating.  What?  To question, yeah?  You understand how funny it is to question the women you're supposed to be dating.  That is bullshit.  You guys wonder why I laugh so much.  Because it's stupid.  It doesn't make sense.

I was simping for this woman.  Not in that way, but, you know, appreciation.  True appreciation.  Well-spoken, intelligent, good-looking woman.  My God.  My God.  No one cares.  Still feminine.  See, men, understand this.  They will think you hate women because you want a better standard of woman.  Hear, hear?  Yeah?  Yeah, is that too much?  I don't care.  In other words, in other words, in other words.  Truly.  Focus.  Observe.  Remember.  The world is yours.  Have a nice day. ",
