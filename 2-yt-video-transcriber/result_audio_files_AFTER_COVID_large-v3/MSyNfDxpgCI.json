            "text": "believe is this when I wanted to marry my wife the woman who's now my wife her father said no.  now I was 31 years old.  when I asked permission to marry her and her father said no because I was a missionary.  I was a believer.  he wasn't.  he was an unbeliever.  he said no.  So what am I going to do?  Well, God told me that I ought to marry her, and so I'm going to take your daughter.  No.  Is there really a God?  Is He really all-powerful?  Is the heart of the king in the palm of His hand?  Can He turn it like a river?  So the whole thing is, I believe that God has given me a love for this woman And I believe he's called me to marry her.  If he's done that, can he not deal with one little human obstacle?  And it was like, God will fight for me if it's his will.  What I need to do is honor that man and honor his daughter and tell him, okay, sir, if that is your decision, I will not marry your daughter.  But I do believe that it is the will of God and I do desire to marry your daughter.  I remember praying about it and walking around and thinking about it, just thinking over and over, not a voice in my heart, but just Scripture and Scripture and just an assurance that if this is God's will, He'll fight for me.  He'll fix it.  I don't have to trust in the arm of the flesh.  And several months later, He came to my wife's grandmother and said, can you believe it?  Did that guy actually listen to me?  I mean, who does that nowadays?  Who listens to a father?  He's a grown man.  He's not a boy.  Can you believe he did that?  I think I ought to let him marry my. ",
