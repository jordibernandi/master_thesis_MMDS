            "text": "Hey, it's Aaron, and today we're going to take another look at the vanguard party and actually kind of dissect it, find out what's good, what's bad, what we should keep, and what we should discard.  So without any further ado, let's get started.  Okay, so what exactly is a vanguard party?  Well, essentially the idea is really quite simple.  What you want to do is have a group of individuals that are well-versed in Marxism-Leninism.  we'll talk more about that in a minute.  Basically the idea is to go out and get as many people together with you as possible that will believe strongly in socialist ideas so that you can march on the Capitol and fight for your freedom and do your revolution and then gain control.  It sounds like a really good idea and in fact it has worked several times in the past.  I'm not one of those people that want to say oh, everything about all Marxism and all Leninism and all of those different socialist experiments are bad.  They're not.  But they are experiments.  And from those experiments, we can learn certain scientific things that will allow us to move forward without making the same mistakes twice.  And we have a lot of different examples where a lot of vanguard parties were used throughout history that we can actually look at.  and find out what worked, what didn't, and what we should keep.  It's a wonderful idea, the Vanguard Party that is, if it is actually done right.  But unfortunately, because of the structure, the way that it's been conceived, it's not really ever done properly.  And I say properly, but I realize that there are a lot of different ways that everything can be done, and it wasn't necessarily done improperly.  It's just, I think that we can probably think of better ways to do it, especially in our modern-day society.  Okay, so what's the main problem with a vanguard party?  Well, I would argue that the main problem with it is that it's very, very susceptible to people infiltrating and co-opting it so they can gain control for themselves.  Even if a vanguard party has the best of intentions and they don't want to ever have anybody specifically gain dictatorship or rule or control over all of the people, they want the people themselves to have control, having a vanguard party really does introduce that element, that ability for these people to gain a certain amount of control.  And once you have that, it's really hard to give it up.  Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely, as the old saying goes.  And when you give a certain group of individuals power over another group of individuals, then those people might start using that power in the wrong way.  Or, if they don't, the people that come in after them will.  We can see that, for example, in the Soviet Union.  You can say that that happened early on during the Stalinist-Leninist period, but you could even say that it happened even more later on in the Soviet Union's history during Gorbachev and all of those sorts of people when all of the ideas of the Soviet Union started to become eroded and destroyed by infiltrators and people that were basically paid off by other groups across the world to destroy the thing.  I'm not saying that the Soviet Union didn't have massive problems outside of that, it obviously did, but some of those problems were created by that.  The problem with having permanent revolutionary organizations is that they can be infiltrated, co-opted, and used as a means to gain and hold power.  That's what happens whenever you have a permanent organization, especially one that's a permanent revolutionary organization.  Eventually, they lose sight of that revolutionary goal because, hey, maybe they achieved the revolution, or maybe it's become so far off that it's impossible to achieve.  In any case, their goals start shifting away from that revolutionary spot... and start shifting more towards them being able to hold and control whatever authority or power that they've been able to gain.  And with that, if there are professional revolutionaries within that group, well, those professional revolutionaries might start moving away from the revolution part and might move more towards the personal enrichment and power part.  Because that's what can happen if you have permanent organizations and professional revolutionaries within those permanent organizations.  Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.  So you have to have checks and balances, ways that you can stop those people from gaining power.  And no, there's no magic bullet.  There's no way of solving this completely.  That's one of the main ideas behind anarchism and libertarianism and freedom in general, is that you have to constantly be forever vigilant.  You have to forever fight for that freedom.  So you can never take a moment and rest.  in the fight for freedom, and you have to always be making sure that people that get any sort of position where they could gain control or gain power are kept in check, kept in balance.  And that just doesn't mean writing it on a piece of paper on a fucking constitution someday and hoping that people are going to abide by that, because as we can see in the United States, people don't abide by the constitution.  But we have to actually put real checks and balances in the way so that people can't gain any sort of control or any sort of power over everybody else.  And to do that, we eliminate the idea of having permanent organizations and professional revolutionary.  Okay, so how does this work?  Well, something that we can do now that we couldn't have done hundreds of years ago is we can decentralize these groups.  We no longer have to have that central organization, that central vanguard party, to do all of the work that the people themselves can do.  And we can do that by actually working together, confederating, if you will, watch my video on democratic confederalism, through means like the internet.  We have the ability to individually talk to and respond to and interact with and engage with and organize with Every single person across the entire world.  We don't have to rely on a specific group of people that have a specific set of knowledge and skills to inform everybody else on how to live.  Now we can do that through education and through propagandizing on the internet.  I'm doing it right now.  And the best part is that I'm actually reaching more people today with one of my videos than even the Communist Manifesto did when it first was released.  I think the Communist Manifesto first released in Germany, now I might have my numbers a little bit wrong here, with a thousand initial copies.  A thousand initial copies.  Somebody like ContraPoints gets hundreds of thousands of views every single video.  I personally get thousands and thousands of views every time I put out a video, and that's amazing.  That's incredible reach.  That's making its way to all kinds of people.  And decentralization is wonderful because it's unable to be infiltrated, or at least it's a lot harder.  When you decentralize all of the different groups, They're not working for one specific organization.  They're all independently doing their own things.  It's a great idea because you can't infiltrate every single group across the entire world.  It's impossible.  You'd need almost as many people to infiltrate those groups as there are groups in general.  And even though those groups might work together somewhat, they are wholly independent of themselves and mainly focusing on education, agitation, and organization.  And when you're doing that, it's almost impossible to infiltrate those groups, especially if you focus on small local groups or just small groups in general of say three to five individuals in an affinity group fashion.  That way, those small independent groups are basically only going to have people that really, really, really know each other within them.  Another major point that we have to stress is that we need leadership and not rulership.  Leadership is something that guides us.  Like I've said before, a guiding light, not an iron fist.  A ruler is somebody who tells you what to do.  A leader is somebody that guides you through how to do something.  There's a very big difference, and as long as we aren't creating these rulers, these dictators that we had in the past, if we're actually working together alongside these people as equals, not as betters or superiors and lessers, but as individuals who have certain sets of knowledge, then we are not going to fall into the same traps that we did before.  Ancient and tribal people rarely had rulers, but they did have people that they looked to to guide them.  They had spiritual advisors or medicine men or tribal chiefs or whatever it is.  These people weren't necessarily the king, the ruler of the entire land, They were more often somebody that they looked to for strength, for guidance, for leadership, for a guiding light.  Somebody that had a little bit more knowledge or a little bit more information or a little bit more know-how than all of the other people.  That guy might be pretty useful, but you can't let him have control over anything because that just leads to another fucking Hitler.  And remember, the means that you use to create your revolution will inevitably become the ends.  And if you start off with rulers, with dictators, with iron-fist warlord kings, then that's what you're going to end up with.  So to eliminate that problem, you have to make sure that all of these vanguard parties are... working from the ground up.  They use democratic means that are from the bottom, rather than a top-down hierarchical structure.  And that means using things like direct democracy, liquid democracy, vote weighing, and ranked choice voting, and not just one specific representative democracy that we use today.  And if all of those small, little, local affinity groups or vanguard parties, if you want to call them that, are able to link together democratically as a confederation, then that means that you'll have a huge, massive group of people all wanting virtually the same thing, but with no one head to chop off.  It's like a hydra.  Every time one of the heads are chopped off, three more erupt in their place.  And you're never able to kill the beast.  And it is essential that each one of those groups uses mass line organization tactics.  And if you want to know more about that, please check out the link in the description box below and also the card up in the top if I remember to put one in.  So yeah, basically there are good things to a vanguard party.  They're strong.  They work.  They're able to organize and educate and agitate enough people to actually gain a foothold.  But unfortunately, they also have a lot of flaws.  They're open to corruption.  They're open to being destroyed because they have a centralized body.  And they're very much open to being infiltrated and co-opted by either capitalists or people who just desire more power.  And those are serious problems.  And we fix those problems through decentralization, leadership not rulership, smaller localized groups, a focus primarily on mass line organizing, confederating all of those groups together, and using ground-up direct democracy rather than top-down hierarchical structures.  So essentially what we've done throughout this video is we've taken a look at a lot of the different socialist experiments that have happened throughout history.  And we've taken a scientific lens to those experiments and tried to figure out ways that we could better them to make them actually work in our modern day society with all of our hyper sophisticated technologically advanced systems that we currently work with.  We have a lot of things that we can use that were good and a lot of things that we can work on that were bad.  So is a Vanguard party in and of itself a horrible thing?  Well, no, not really.  It's actually a pretty good idea and it's had an incredibly high success rate.  but it can be improved.  And we've talked about ways of improving it here.  As socialists, as Marxists, as anarchists, as leftists in general, we can't just look at our ideologies as being static things that never advance and never adapt and never change over time.  We have to look at things logically and critically and rationally.  and change things if we need to, gain more knowledge as we get it, and make decisions that can actually benefit our society in the long run, and be able to learn different tactics that are able to help us win.  The classic Marxist-Leninist vanguard party does not work.  It is a functional system that does gain power, but it almost always leads to infiltration, corruption... or destruction, and I don't want to see that happen again.  And the way we fix that is by democratizing the vanguard, flattening that hierarchy, getting rid of the corruptive elements, and making it into something that actually functions.  And I hate to break this to you, but all of the solutions that I've been proposing here, the things that probably would work, are anarchist solutions, and I suppose that I just basically created some sort of decentralized anarchist vanguardish party?  I don't know exactly what it would be, but basically it works off of the same idea that I talked about in my How to Revolution series, the decentralized mass line.  That's how we do this.  And a lot of Marxists, Leninists, socialists, and everybody else all across the leftist spectrum have all said that this idea has the ability to work.  It's worked a lot of times in the past.  As long as we adapt it to our modern day 21st century world, there's a good chance we have a very high success rate.  Anyway, that's the way I look at it.  If you do get a chance, please check out all the links in the description box below.  Hit that little bell button because they ain't going to tell you when I release a new video.
