Hello everybody, Terrorist Pop here with another episode of Live from the Lair.  Alright, now for the women in my audience who watch my videos, most of you downvote them so I really don't care.  You should probably pay attention, the average age now for the woman getting divorced is is between 36 and 39.7 years of age.  Now this, coupled with the marriage rates, there's a new stat that just came out that the marriage rates are the lowest that they have ever been since they started tracking that stat in the mid 1800s.  All right, so the age of the woman getting divorced for the first time and the low marriage rates have pretty much destroyed the second and third marriage market out there.  And I'm not seeing it ever returning.  So women are finding themselves getting divorced right on the edge of 40.  They don't take into account that they have slammed into the goddamn wall starting at 30, and they're probably bashing through it at 33.  And by the time they pull a pin, get out of their first marriage, They've already gone through the wall and they don't realize it because they have totally drank the Kool-Aid of the feminist agenda.  All right, which said, hey, you can have it all.  He's not treating you right.  You deserve better.  But what they're not realizing, and a lot of these women do regret it, you know, seven to ten years later.  The grass is a greener on the other side and they had a pretty good thing.  If their husband that they divorced didn't beat him, didn't drink, didn't take drugs, didn't kick the dog, wasn't mean to his kids, worked a job, came home at night, paid the bills, you probably had a pretty good deal.  10 years later when you're like coming up on 50, And you really have had no, you know, chomping at the bit.  It tends to make people regret shit.  Now, a lot of common problems that you have with the Western women today are single motherhood is rampant.  So a lot of guys are like, eh, eh, no.  The woman's probably divorced.  You know, if she got married at all.  A large majority of these women out there in their 40s were married and got divorced.  And you could tell a boatload about this woman if she's shitty to her ex.  I don't know about you gentlemen, but I've met women.  I've gone out with women.  And when I hear shit like, well, that's the wrong answer.  I expected this.  Listen, the minute those words come out, I walk to the edge of the platform, grab my reserve by the handle, jump out and rip it.  I'm out.  I'm gone.  I'm going out of the bird on three bells.  It's on fire.  It's not going anywhere good.  And gentlemen, if you come across women who are overly entitled, cut your losses while you can.  Alright, now a lot of these women start to feel the pinch.  Late 30s, early 40s.  At this point, they start to realize that, you know, hey, you know, feminism lied to me.  and now that I'm older and feminism doesn't give a fuck about me either, so I'm out there flapping.  When they finally realize they're never having kids, they go into a deep, deep depression.  And you can see the effects of this And the uptick in the amount of women in their 40s and older who are binge drinking and attempting suicide.  But we should feel sorry for them because they're women in vagina.  And most of the time, they made their bed and then they want us to feel sorry for them when they have to lay in it.  Well, I don't think so.  Now let's move on to the other board.  You are not the daughter of a god.  And you're not a superhero.  And you don't have an iron suit.  You're 120 pounds soaking wet.  You're not some Mary Sue in a film.  You wanna kick my ass?  I'm right here.  Kick my ass.  You don't have any guts?  No.  I do have a couple of grenades, though.  Wait, what?  Oh, I've been a rebel.  Are those for real?  What the hell would I be walking around with fake grenades for?  Miss Courtney, do you believe in destiny?  I got a taste for it.  I got a... all right now during the lockdown as i mentioned in the beginning 60 of the layoffs and you know people that were getting you know a red line through their name from their employers were women and mainly because those are low paying low skilled jobs they whine about it.  they think they should get paid the same amount as men who have essential jobs and have to deal with risk and death.  sorry it doesn't work that way.  If you went to a decent college and took classes in economics instead of women's studies, you would realize that.  I'm sorry, but that's just the way it is.  That's just the way it is.  And you know what you do to avoid that situation, ladies?  Stay married.  Because most of the women who are married are not in poverty.  That stat is really low.  I think it's somewhere between 12 and 16%.  68% of the elderly poor over 65 are single women.  Of that 65%, 50% of them who are over 65 are income insecure, which means they are slightly below or severely below the poverty line.  So they go to college for their passion or something they want to have fun doing, and And they don't realize that J-O-B is not spelled F-U-N.  And most of the time, anything that you do that's fun is not productive and doesn't get your resources or money at the end.  Yes, there are people out there who manage to make a good living doing what they love, but it's not the norm.  And most of the time, you people out there aren't going to be able to reach that threshold.  As it stands, I believe we've already burned through $2 trillion.  They're working on another $3 trillion in stimulus money for this pandemic that has a 99% survival rate.  Okay, and if the Democrats get their way, they're going to keep going.  And it's only a matter of time before the whole ball of wax caves in.  You can say bye-bye to all of these safety net programs.  A lot of you people out there who have money in the market to include your retirements, your 401ks that you're living on, That money's gone.  You went from being comfortable living well to poverty.  That's going to cause a lot of people to get pissed off.  I'll be one of them. ",
