            "text": "Good morning people watching Ms.  65, Lisa Boyce here.  I'm going to give you the gospel.  It's in 1 Corinthians 15, 1 through 4.  That Christ spilled his blood for our sins, past, present, and future sins.  Was buried and rose again on the third day according to scripture.  That's grace.  That's the mystery.  That's the gospel.  We don't come to him like I keep saying and like I will say.  We don't come to him saying what we've done.  We come to him accepting and believing in what he did for us.  That's the gospel.  2 Corinthians 11, and I found this.  even though I knew it was there and I read it a million times.  2 Corinthians 11.3 says, but I fear, and this is Paul speaking to the Corinthian church, but I fear, least by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety, his craftiness, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.  it is simple.  the gospel is simple.  we simply believe in what he did.  now I know there are people out there coming against me and making videos about me and I really don't care.  I don't care because the gospel is simple.  we simply truly accept and believe by faith in what he did for us and our past, present, future sins.  Otherwise, you have no other recourse.  If you don't believe what he did, if you don't accept what he did for us at the cross, then you're an unbeliever.  People want to put a new spin on this and a new gospel.  And the funny thing is that next verse, after the simplicity of Christ, in verse 4 it says, For if he that cometh preaches another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or if ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with it.  In other words, good luck.  Because that's not the gospel that's preached in the Bible.  The gospel is simple.  We simply come to him by believing.  Not by saying what we can do and what we've done.  I've heard people in the past say, I knew it was more to it than just believing.  No, it's not.  There is no more to it than just believing.  Believing.  The Bible says in Romans that, and I'm paraphrasing, confess with your mouth and believe in your heart that Jesus is Lord.  If you believe, if you truly believe, then you are saved and sealed until the day of redemption.  I wanted to get that out there.  I'm aware of people coming against me, and that's fine.  I knew it would happen.  I don't expect no less.  Matter of fact, if they didn't come against me, then something would be wrong on my part.  So it's fine.  Let them.  I got this off of, Keegan sent this to me yesterday, and I wanted to give this to you.  And this is another reason why you need to get saved.  Cantors, and this is off of the Jerusalem Post, cantors chauffeur blowers to travel freely on Rosh Hashanah, on the Jewish holiday, in order to ensure that all people can pray and hear the chauffeur blown on Rosh Hashanah, Despite the lockdown, the religious affairs and health ministers have arranged for special travel permits for cantors and chauffeur blowers.  Coronavirus Commissioner Professor Ronnie Gamzu approved the protocol.  It says, the need to allow for the travel of these individuals is critical in order to fulfill the holiday, said the religious affairs ministry CEO, The ministry will publish on its website a form that these individuals to fill out, which will be approved by the ministry.  Once approved, they will be able to bring the form with them if they are stopped by any inspector.  In addition, the ministry said, that it has worked with local authorities to ensure that they can enable enough outdoor and indoor spaces for High Holy Day prayers while still following the health ministry restrictions.  The ministry revealed a special outline for High Holy Day prayers approved by the government earlier this week.  In all areas, people can pray unhindered but in capsules of only 20 people.  It says here in red zones of which there are now around 70 such areas, prayer will be permitted in closed structures in groups of up to 10 people.  The permitted numbers of groups in a closed area will be function of the number of entrants to the structure.  So basically they're allowed to blow their chauffeurs.  The first two entrances multiplied by three each and each additional entrance multiplied by two on conditions that the ratio of one person per four square meters of space is maintained.  So they got all that there, but the basics of this article is that the chauffeur, it sounds like the chauffeurs will be blown on this day.  That's significant.  Not to mention, like I said yesterday, the rockets that are being fired in southern Israel, 13 people were injured yesterday.  And it says here, Israeli aircraft strike Gaza, more rockets hit southern Israel.  Things are happening, and it seems like after that peace treaty was signed yesterday, things kind of sped up a little bit.  I'm going to link this article in the description box and let you read it, and I'm going to link some more articles, too.  I'll be back later with more.  In the meantime, have a nice morning.  Thank you. ",
