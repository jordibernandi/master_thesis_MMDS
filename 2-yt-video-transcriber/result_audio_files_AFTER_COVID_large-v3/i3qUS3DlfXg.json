            "text": "A video showing a converted Chinese factory producing N95 masks for medical staff is raising concern.  Chinese authorities take issue with a woman's gift of Bibles and masks to her family in China.  Chinese-listed company on the New York Stock Exchange, GSX Tech Edu, is facing allegations of fraud.  And a new Western intelligence dossier states the Chinese regime intentionally hid evidence leading to the pandemic.  Find out what's included in the 15-page document.  Welcome to China In Focus, I'm Tiffany Meyer.  Many Chinese factories have little or no business during the outbreak, so they've started producing face masks instead.  But countries around the world have reported serious quality issues with China's masks.  A video circulating on social media shed some light on why that may be.  This is where the N95 face masks for medical staff are packed.  Two of the workers aren't wearing gloves.  And they're all just wearing regular clothes, no protective suits.  At least two of the workers aren't wearing masks.  They've packed quite a lot.  Again, a man packing masks without gloves, a mask or a protective suit.  These are regular face masks.  It's unclear if the environment has been sanitized.  someone sweeping the floor while people are working nearby.  It appears to be a big factory.  This is an auto factory in the U.S.  It's also started producing face masks during the pandemic.  May 1st is the first day of a five-day holiday in China.  People usually travel during this time, but this year there are still restrictions in place.  An official announcement says only three out of five sightseeing spots in Hubei province have reopened.  And one of Wuhan's most famous hotspots is still closed.  For those that have reopened, they will only allow 30 percent of the usual number of tourists in, and they must wear face masks, show their green health code, keep social distancing and not gather together.  Now to China's northernmost province, Heilongjiang.  According to state-run media, local authorities in Harbin City have issued an urgent notice.  Certain restaurants, like barbecues, will be closed from May 2.  A date for reopening has not been announced.  According to internal documents obtained by NTD, the outbreak in Harbin is out of control.  The leading group for combating the epidemic in Heilongjiang sent a warning letter to its Harbin branch on April 13.  The letter says there's been a coronavirus outbreak in Harbin and cases of community spread are increasing.  Now to Beijing.  According to local media, in the first four months of the year, Beijing's parks saw less than half the number of visitors at the same time last year.  Visitors must wear face masks and have their temperature taken before entering the parks.  Beijing citizens have been told to prioritize prevention and control of the virus, wash their hands frequently, disinfect environments frequently, practice social distancing, air rooms out frequently, and not gather in large groups.  Another Chinese-listed company on the New York Stock Exchange is being accused of fraud.  GSX Tech Edu, an online education company, has come under fire for fabricating its number of registered users.  Citron Research released a statement on April 30, stating there was conclusive evidence GSX Tech Edu overstates revenues and profits.  According to the release, 40 percent of GSX's 2019 registered users were fake.  Citron Research previously published a report on April 14th saying the company's 2019 revenue was overstated by 70%.  Citron Research said on May 1st the feedback from China on GSX has been amazing, adding there are many honest Chinese people who want to see this gone, and calling it the next Luckin Coffee, which also came under fire for fraud charges earlier this year.  In an interview with CNBC, the president of the EU showed support for a proposed investigation into the origin of the CCP virus.  Ursula von der Leyen said on May 1st, we've learned lessons this time.  Adding governments need to establish an early warning system with robust data.  And to do that, they need transparency. ",

The 15-page document obtained by Australian Daily Telegraph covers the Chinese regime's mistakes, including denial of human-to-human transmission, destroying virus lab samples, disinfecting the Huanan seafood market before investigations could occur, and refusing to provide samples to international scientists for vaccine development.  The dossier also provides a timeline for China's response to the virus outbreak, including the silencing of whistleblower Dr.  Li Wenliang.  The regime also began censoring search term words that day, deleting terms like SARS variation, Wuhan seafood market and Wuhan unknown pneumonia.  The report goes on to state that in February, China pressured the  U.S.,  Italy, India, Australia and Southeast Asian neighbors not to protect themselves via travel restrictions.  This despite China itself implementing severe travel restrictions.  The Saturday Telegraph reported on Australia's involvement, highlighting two key figures at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, Dr.  Shizhen Li and Zhou Peng, who worked in Australia for five years, focusing their research on uncurable bat coronaviruses.  A German media is calling for antibodies not just against the virus but also against the Chinese communist regime.  An opinion piece in The Welt says China is waging a propaganda of lies and calls out the German government and the EU for not speaking out against the regime.  The op-ed calls for effective antibodies against the economic and political influence of dictatorships.  Giving masks has become a way for some Chinese people to show their love to their families.  One woman, however, became a target of the CCP because she sent masks and Bibles from America to China. ",

Another advantage of using cleaning robots is that no one has to enter the contaminated room, and Japan is using robots as well.  A hotel in Tokyo opened for patients with lighter symptoms who do not need hospital treatment.  The hotel is using two types of robots.  One robot is programmed with positive messages to help patients stay positive.  The other is an AI robot that cleans.  An app will also allow patients to record their temperature with a smartphone.
