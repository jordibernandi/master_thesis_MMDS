            "text": "See the whole creation waiting on the manifestation of the sons of God, the saints patient.  In a spiritual war unto the spiritual powers.  Get it down till we go.  make nations proud.  Beating the dust and powder.  Crawl on your belly like a serpent cow.  With no scar face, this earth is ours.  Fogging on heads like the turf was flowers.  Walls of the city, they great and high.  I go up and down, it's a close encounter.  Prophecies I see fulfilled.  We live for that.  the banner on this earth mountain.  John 7, 38 rivers and fountains flowing through the city like a pyramid fountain.  Going through the city to seal them.  County, that's a lost penny on the ground.  2020 blitz.  Get me on fifth, throw a net, catch a hundred fifty-three big fish.  Niffin' me a stone, turn around, they necktie.  Still tryna.  see, did it sink that quick?  Be a street bullet, stronghold, pull it down, boost to the ground.  Ranks get four, enemy at home, sleep.  what you in this for?  Cause it ain't no peace when we win this war.  Twenty-twenty blitz, get me on fifth, throw a net, catch a hundred fifty-three big fish.  Niffin' me a stone, turn around, they necktie.  Still tryna see, did it sink that quick?  Be a street bullet, stronghold, pull it down, boost to the ground.  Ranks get four, enemy at home, sleep.  what you in this for?  Cause it ain't no peace when we win this war.  Real recognize real and they unfamiliar.  Brothers fold like dollar bills for 30 piece of silver.  I ain't got no hatred for you.  Your own works to kill you.  You'll sin now and pay later cause the Lord will bill you.  That's enough.  I'm about to head to Memphis.  I'm done addressing these false brothers.  They so pretentious.  Our people dying.  They need profits to bring the senses.  The cost of sin is your life and that's too expensive.  Christ paid it with his life, he paid those expenses But only for the Israelites who follow repentance.  For these preachers still lying, ain't no happy ending.  I'm Gary Payton with the gospel, I'm set to defend it.  The deacon put the order out.  so I'm on the mission.  A lot of brothers on the couch just scratching and itching Rolling round like a door swinging on the hinges And if the shoe fits, I hope they get offended.  Not no more!  Not no more!  Who's the king?  Right!  Who's the king?  Right!  What time is it?  What time?  And if you ain't gonna sleep with you in this world, cause it ain't no peace if we win this war.  Yeah, we got that fire, so don't run from the script.  They get the gun from your hip, get hit with the fire.  Not the fire that come from a clip, but the fire that come from our lips and we ready to blaze.  When that alarm erupt, I mean it's time that we armor up.  Yeah, these heaters be really thinking they harming us.  But our God won't allow them to punish us.  They gonna honor us, so we advise them to let go.  It was awesome to get close.  It'll be the old make-up.  When they see that punk full of gold with the boots on the ground like a step show.  Echo, let's go.  Take over the planet.  Just as long as the Lord behind us, these heathens can't stand it.  And we gon' split.  So when they catch 153 big fish.  Living millstones around they necks.  I still tryna see.  did it sink that quick.  Be a street bullet.  Stronghold pull it down.  Boots to the ground.  Ranks get full.  If you at home, sleep what you in this for.  Cause it ain't no pizza, we win this for.  War, 2020 blitz, get me on fist, so I let catch 153 big fish, sniffing millstones out around they neck, I still tryna see.  did it sink that quick, build street bullets, stronghold pull it down, boots to the ground, ranks get four, and if you at home, sleep with you in this war, cause it ain't no peace till we win this war.  Nice to meet you, Mr.  War and Peace.  Tell me one thing, how do we war and peace?  The lions roaring while they sleep and count sheep.  Kings and priests, I'd rather chill and sip the greats' blood.  But the word of God is ticking on my taste buds.  Got this little light of mine.  I let it shine like the new moon.  Not your average doo-doo, this brew food.  Demand of war fed me manna.  Now I'm ready, this ain't playtime, but Blitz pulled a hit stick, Mike Bick to a K-9.  Calling all soldiers from the city of California, from the bottom of the map to the desert Arizona.  Hear the prophesy of war, famine pestilence.  like Rona, you a goner.  If you ain't willing to mortify your members, make them quipper, cause it ain't no peace.  You looking at your priest, no more hiding in the corner, we in your face on Beale Street, now feel me.  When I say you better repair, that's the end of your existence.  We blitz in 2020 down in Tennessee.  I think it's time.  We out here killing each other.  I think it's time for this.  So everybody on my Facebook live, I'm with you.  We the black man in Memphis, Tennessee.  What you saying to the men of God?  We'll be right back.  No, you can't break through this line.  This for the deaf and the blind.  We can't be wasting no time.  You better make up your mind.  We stay on the grind.  We on God while you stalling.  Gotta make sure of my calling.  We won't lose.  Yeah, I know they want to kill us when they see us, but they really want to be us because we do what they don't do.  We just do what we're supposed to.  You can hate if you want to.  We produce more fruit like whole foods.  Yeah, the end will be close to.  Many call, but each host few.  From city to city, we making moves.  Hit the streets, then we breaking tools.  Scripts kicking like taking tools.  So much purple, we make the news.  Repent or die, we don't make the rules.  Welcome to the lion's den.  Fix your face, you OKC, we on the rise again.  We in the scripts and in the streets to section doctrine sin.  Hidden history, we teach rebuilding lives again.  Look.  it's hammer time if you ain't know enough.  it's the book of our fathers and yeah we keep it opened up.  i like shine like bruce lee roy and show enough.  come up to the prophets correct?  or get cold cut.  cut them cold cuts.  yeah home sleep.  what you in this for see it ain't no pc.  you in this for six Tired of these dead bodies scattered on the floor.  Got enough dead brothers, I don't want no more.  That's the parable for Egypt and how it all relates.  back to Memphis.  That's why you see the prophets out blitzing with no intermission.  R-U-I-C on the mission.  So start what you're doing, just listen.  Don't come to pay attention.  Don't be confused when you catch on the street with a meat that was sent because the Lord seek vengeance.  They're still waking up the valley of the dry bones with the real blues coming straight out the trenches.  It's a hard-knock life, but we out here winning.  Just keep the command, stop sinning.  Only fear was chosen, but when the Lord called, you know he called me in.  Gotta fight this fight, gotta win this war.  When I swing this hammer, gonna hit like Thor.  Better get your camera, better hit Rick.  Cause it ain't for a glamour when I lift this sword.  This a Memphis bitch, you can get hit quick.  We Avengers for the nations, dies in the fire, it dies to Satan like a ninja in the Matrix.  I walk the walk, I talk the talk, like Devo, I'ma pull it.  Like a lasso stretch, I'ma cast a net, find Nemos, and I pull it.  I walk the walk, I talk the talk, like Devo, I'ma pull it.  Like a lasso stretch, I'ma cast a net, find Nemos, and I pull it.  No, we not like you.  We different disciples.  It's not in the Bible.  We don't entertain.  Not here to fight with you, nor to be tight with you.  See that we blitz and no need to explain.  We don't dislike you.  We just don't align with you.  Tend to your business.  Acknowledge our lane.  Can two walk together unless they agree?  When you get this meeting, then you do the same.  We out here to wake up our people.  Don't play with no evil.  That don't come through with our brains.  We focus on feeding our family these strips.  If this ain't your focus, then we ain't the same.  I keep it 180%.  You know they kept out here bringing this change, and they did diminish the words you're trying to do, but you must repent if you seek to be saved.  2020 bliss, get me on fish, throw a net, catch 153 big fish, sniffing millstones out around they necks, I still tryna see, did it sink that quick?  Be a street bullet, stronghold, pull it down, boost to the ground, right skin forward, enemy at home, sleep what you in this for, cause it ain't no peace, we win this war.  2020 bliss, get me on fish, throw a net, catch 153 big fish, sniffing millstones out around they necks, I still tryna see, did it sink that quick?
