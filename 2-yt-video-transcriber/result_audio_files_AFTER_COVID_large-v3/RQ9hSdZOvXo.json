Stop that bullshit about this vaccine, the vaccine.  Now, on the flip side, I understand why black people don't want to take the vaccine.  Black people don't want to take the goddamn vaccine because they don't trust your white ass.  That's what it really comes down to.  Everybody should take the vaccine, okay?  White people do not trust what white people gonna put in that goddamn vaccine because they don't watch white people destroy them over and over and over and over again.  Everybody should take the vaccine, okay?  And if we ain't learned nothing from Nazi Germany, we learned that them Germans, they knew how to kill you right through their medical system.  They was killing every injured and maimed or paraplegic in the entire country.  Everybody should take the vaccine, okay?  Because doping them up, killing them, doing all kinds of shit to them.  So I understand how black people think, but take the goddamn vaccine shot.  Stop listening to the conspiracy theorists out here telling you not to take the vaccine and all that.  Man, listen, let them run through them trials, finish what they got to do, and when the vaccine come around, don't even sweat that bullshit, man.  Now, on the flip side, I understand why black people don't want to take the vaccine.  Black people don't want to take the goddamn vaccine because they don't trust your white ass.  That's what it really comes down to, to take the vaccine.  Black people do not trust what white people are going to put in that goddamn vaccine because they don't watch white people destroy them over and over and over and over again.  Everybody... to take the vaccine, okay? ",

At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought.  Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it.
