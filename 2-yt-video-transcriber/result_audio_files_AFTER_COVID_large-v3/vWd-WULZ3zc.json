But so far, they've coordinated with police, they've avoided engaging in violence and so on.  And to be perfectly fair, there's not a moral equivalency here.  The white militia movement is older, larger, probably more heavily armed, certainly more pervasive, and many more people, and it has been violent.  The other thing I have to say, there's been some comments that have been a little questionable, but I don't see out of this African-American militia an overtly racist ideology. ",
