This is supposedly a graph of climate change, but the units are not units of climate change, whatever those would even be, but rather, more specifically, units of temperature.  And it's also misleading.  Here's an actual graph of how much the temperature has changed over the last few decades, And even if you start looking as recently as 1997, you can still clearly see an upward trend.  Climate change denialists love to crop these graphs in such a way as to hide long-term trends.  The fact that you can't see a long-term trend over an arbitrary short-term segment of time is obviously a completely fallacious argument against the existence or continuation of a long-term trend.  If you look at the long-term graphs, there's no reason to think that climate change is slowing or stopped.  And how could it?  What could even be a mechanism for causing such a thing?  Carbon emissions haven't slowed or stopped.  And without that, or a volcanic eruption big enough to significantly darken the sky, there's nothing to stop the temperature from rising. ",

            "text": "So let's clear the air and create a more accurate picture of where we really stand on the issue of global warming, or as it is now called, climate change.  There are basically three groups of people dealing with this issue.  Groups one and two are scientists.  Group three consists mostly at its core of politicians, environmentalists, and media.  Group 1 is associated with the scientific part of the United Nations International Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC Working Group 1.  These are scientists who mostly believe that recent climate change is primarily due to man's burning of fossil fuels, oil, coal, and natural gas.  This releases CO2 into the atmosphere, and they believe this might eventually dangerously heat the planet.  Group 2 is made up of scientists who don't see this as an especially serious problem.  This is the group I belong to.  We're usually referred to as skeptics.  We note that there are many reasons why the climate changes, the sun, clouds, oceans, the orbital variations of the earth, as well as a myriad of other inputs.  None of these is fully understood.  And there is no evidence that CO2 emissions are the dominant factor. ",

I'm sure many of you have heard of this study by Cook et  al.,  which looked at published scientific articles about climate change from 1991 to 2011. and concluded that among abstracts expressing a position on anthropogenic global warming, 97.1% endorsed the consensus position that humans are causing global warming.  A common way that climate change denialists like to rebut this study is to point out that science isn't done by consensus of opinion.  But this misinterprets what the study is saying.  The papers which say that humans are causing climate change are not expressing the opinions of scientists.  Rather, these papers describe experiments testing whether humans cause climate change.  And in 97.1% of cases, the results of the experiments corroborate that theory.  The Cook study is not an appeal to authority.  It's an appeal to the overwhelming preponderance of the evidence.  Not only is it false to say that there is no evidence that CO2 emissions are the dominant factor causing climate change, the vast majority of all experiments testing this theory conducted between 1991 and 2011 produced evidence that they do.  Saying that there's no evidence is an outright lie. ",

That has absolutely nothing to do with whether rising sea levels are a danger.  This is the same trick that industries which used lead tried to pull.
