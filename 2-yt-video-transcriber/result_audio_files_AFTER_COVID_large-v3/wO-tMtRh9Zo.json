As always, appreciate all the support during these rough and tough times.  Stay tuned for an upcoming giveaway here this week.  My way of giving back to the community.  I've aligned myself with a fantastic group.  to help put together a really cool giveaway that involves not only coins, but also cash.  People need cash these days, and we're here to deliver, so stay tuned for that.  So let's go ahead and start out by taking a look at the coin that kind of started it all.  So the turn of the century marked a huge change in Canadian coinage, specifically the Canadian one-cent coin.  Now, there were things going on during this time, you know, the millennium was coming up, rising costs of various kind of tried and true compositions like nickel and copper and things of that nature.  cost to manufacture a penny whether it's in canada and even the united states even though we're still making it was certainly rising.  you know in some cases it was costing anywhere from three to five cents to produce the penny.  okay canada kind of figured out you know and foresaw the future coming so they were ready to plant for it.  so in 1999 what they had done was that they were experimenting with various other planchettes.  okay for a 99 they produced a multi-ply plated steel composition.  that sounds like an overload of just information regarding the actual makeup of what these coins are but what it is is it is ultra thin electroplating of nickel and copper over a steel core to produce this new planchet.  so in 1999 they actually produced a number of these planchet this new multi-ply steel planchet coins um but more so for the test market.  okay and it's more geared toward the vending business.  and yes the royal canadian mint did care enough about local business and corporations to produce its own separate allotment Test coins, which is pretty cool.  So this 1999 that you see here was was made.  and keep in mind that the test pieces have this letter P under the bust of Queen Elizabeth the second.  so you'll know exactly what you're looking for when it comes to these coins.  now for 1999 The Royal Canadian Mint made well over a billion pieces on just the regular, I guess, copper-plated zinc planchet that they've known for a few years at this point, because I believe 1996 was the last year of the true copper Canadian pennies.  But they had produced, just as kind of like an approximate number, over 20,000 test pieces for the vending market.  Okay, so these companies that produce vending machines, you know, for sodas and snacks and things of that nature.  They produce these, they test out the machinery to see how the coins read in the mechanisms.  And then, you know, they go ahead and tweak and twerk and all this other stuff.  Those mechanisms to be able to accept the new planchet.  So it's from this point on, from 1999 all the way up to the final year of the Canadian set.  Yes, they did cease production back in 2011, if you haven't read about it yet.  Yeah.  But there's a lot of various interesting things going on in the last 12 years of the Canadian penny that not a whole bunch of people really know about, except some of your really big diehard collectors north of the border.  so you know the 1999 p test piece is a coin that sometimes you can find in circulation now.  the big thing today is if you have coins that you needed to deposit at the bank all right usually the bank will take whatever pay rolled up pennies that you give them for deposit.  they'll take those and send it all through the Royal Canadian Mint for destruction.  Okay, you might find some banks that will actually redistribute, but the overall just commerce society has adapted to the absence of the penny coin in that country.  So, you know, the rounding of taxes and all this other stuff to the nearest, I believe, five cents.  Okay, for those of you north of the border, you can probably kind of clarify things for me.  But yeah, this right here is a marquee turning point in what is the final 12 years of the Canadian penny.  But it's also worth mentioning that in 2000, the Royal Canadian Mint also produced a few test pieces with the letter P under the bust.  There's only a few now.  Okay, they're quite the rarity and I haven't seen one graded or out in the open marketplace, you know.  how rare and valuable those coins are is anybody's question.  it's going to be tens of thousands of dollars if you're able to find an example now.  they did produce the regular copper coated zinc planchet coins all the way up to 2003 along with a bunch of other new plated composition coins for 2002 and 2003. um Believe it or not, the test token pieces that the Royal Canadian Mint produced in 1999 actually became quite a hit.  People were actually looking for these, and the Royal Canadian Mint listened to its collector base.  And what they did was, in 2001, they actually produced a collector set with an example of a 2001P plated collection.  coin penny.  so those do exist out there although this one right here the 99p you can buy on the secondary market for about 15 to 20 bucks so it's not bad.  higher grade specimens will come in a little bit more.  but this is the coin again with just over 20,000 pieces reported to be produced is an attainable rarity in terms of Canadian coinage.  so that's interesting.  But it wasn't until 2006 where things got absolutely bonkers.  And when I mean bonkers, wow.  The Royal Canadian Mint made about five or six different variants of the 2006 Canadian penny.  And obviously there was no shortage of these coins.  Collectively, there was over $1.1 billion.  billion coins produced in 2006. okay the vast majority of these coins are uh the regular copper coated zinc coins in which 866,275,000 pieces were produced.  Now the coin that you see on screen here is the 2006 and again you see that letter P under a much more mature QE2 bust minus the crown and all that.  of course at this point of her life she's Well along.  in the years, the Royal Canadian Mint did this new design of the much more mature QE2.  So this particular coin right here is actually a low mintage type of specimen.  This is that newer composition, the multi-ply plated over a steel core set.  As you can see, it's got that letter P under this new bust of QE2.  So this coin right here could generally be had for between $10 and $20 if you wanted an example today.  So there is some value in some of these coins.  This is one such example where 233,000 pieces were made in this new composition with the letter P under the bust.  Now the Royal Canadian Mint also produced a coin like this in 2006 and my apologies about the out of focus images on this one.  But this is a 2006 that actually has a Royal Canadian Mint privy mark.  under the bust.  so yet again this is another variant that was produced by rcm and they also made this in the zinc composition and also the multi-ply steel.  all right.  so you want to just imagine with steel core sense they are magnetic all right so you can stick a magnet to it.  as opposed to the zinc they do not magnetize and that's usually one of the things that people use to kind of identify one to the other.  there's just to throw a little magnet on there.  if it sticks you're good to go.  Now, the RCM Privy Mark 2006 Canadian pennies were produced in healthy numbers.  The zinc fashion, there was 176 million pieces made.  And then the multi-ply steel was 137,733,000. pieces were produced again very widely available.  uh not something i would probably go out of my way to go and purchase for any considerable premium but just know that that double coin uh set exists out there in change today.  And then finally, the last coin that matters most to all of us, that's why we clicked on the video, right, is to talk about a very significant 2006 Canadian penny.  It's the one that you see here.  Now, it looks no different than a traditional, I guess, zinc coin.  It has no letter P under the bust.  It doesn't have the privy mark under the bust.  So it looks like just your run-of-the-mill penny.  keep an eye on this coin without those markings under the bus because you may either have the high mintage zinc planchet coin or you may have get this the multi-ply steel.  okay as you guys know they were supposed to put the p under the bus.  this one does not have it.  this is an actual documented coin on ebay.  so i achieved these photos picked them up from off of one of the sellers on there.  you know uh... go ahead and give credit to that seller of course uh... for the images.  and you know this is a coin you're going to keep an eye on.  so if you find a coin like this and you may think that it's just zinc put a magnet up to it.  if it sticks This is going to be the Logo Less 2006 multi-ply steel composition coin.  Okay, and this is the ultra-rarity that you need to look out for.  Now, coins in this condition, where it looks like it's circulated quite a bit, often and tend to sell in the $50 to $150 range.  That is a pretty wide range.  But if you have coins that are a lot less desirable in terms of overall appearance, those are going to be your $50, $60, $70 coins.  So even in low ball grades, they have quite a bit of value.  Make sure it sticks to the magnet.  When you have a coin that looks like what you see on screen, probably kind of like that mid-state 60 AU58 type grade.  You can see it's got a little bit of circulation where this is more along the lines of your $100 coin.  When you find this coin, grab a magnet right away.  If it sticks, then you have the valuable type of the 2006.  And make sure it doesn't have the letter P under the bust or the pretty mark.  Okay, that's going to be key.  And they are still out there.  People are finding these in their penny rolls today, whether you're in Canada or you're here stateside.  They're being found in both locations.  All right, so let's go ahead and talk about a few sales because that's what really matters here.  So we have a number of coins.  I got six for you relatively recent within the last like 30 to 45 days.  So, you know, here's the first three right here.  So we have the 2006 one cent.  no logo magnetic.  Make sure it is original luster uncirculated.  This one sold for $177.49 shipped.  So keep in mind this is the conversion rate.  The numbers are italicized, I guess.  That denotes that this is the conversion rate to US dollars from Canadian.  If it was Canadian, it's probably like $250 Canadian.  Once you click on the listing, you can find out for sure.  But all three of these are from Canada.  The second one here is an ICCS graded, which, by the way, that's one of the foremost best grading companies for Canadian coins.  And they are actually based in Canada.  All right.  This one is a mid-state 64 red.  Sold for $142.02 and a little shipping in there.  And then we have a nice raw example here, which looks like it's circulated quite a bit in the AU55.  A best offer was accepted.  Probably in that $90 to $100 range.  And then based off of the shipping, it looks like it's going to a regular number 10 envelope.  So that's the first three there.  The next set right here is much more impressive.  I guess we'll start at the bottom.  So you have an extremely rare 2006 magnetic, no logo, no P, Canadian small cent.  This one sold for a best offer, probably $250 to $300.  That's a really nice condition, by the way.  Here's another ICCS graded coin.  It appears this one is a 65.  This one sold as the best offer.  And then finally, the crown jewel out of all the top sold sales was from March 9th.  We have a really nice looking full red, very lustrous example, albeit it looks like there's a fingerprint on there.  So yeah, that's usually a detractor for me.  But this one sold for $745.61 US.  Pretty amazing coin.  They probably have to figure this one would grade out 66 for that kind of money.  But as you can tell, very valuable coin ladies and gentlemen.  Search it out.  Hopefully I wasn't too overly wordy and informative in this video.  I tried to give you everything you need to know.  In order to know exactly how these coins came to be.  It's more than just saying, oh yeah, look out for the 2006 non-magnetic penny.  Oh yeah, well tell me more about it.  Because usually people ask.  So there you go.  I gave you the whole rundown.
