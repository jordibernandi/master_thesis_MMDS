Myself, Rav Ephraim, Rav Chaim, where you'll have also newer features where you're able to use the app while you're using other applications on your phone.  You'll be able to share the lectures directly from the app.  You'll be able to donate online and support our CUVE and our Torah work that we're doing.  And the most exciting feature is that you'll be able to actually ask questions directly on the app and get answers from the rabbis directly from the app.  This is something unprecedented, and Baruch Hashem will be able to offer it.  Thank you again for all of your support.  Check it out.  Make sure you have the kosher Torah that will re-energize your neshama each and every single day.  Call to b'chava tzachal.  Thank you. ",
