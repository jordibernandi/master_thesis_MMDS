So in the book, just right out of the bat, my attention was just grasped and just really gripped me.  was this story you told of a friend of yours who was a shot in the line of duty.  And he lived or I don't want to get that out of the way.  I wouldn't be talking about it if it wasn't the case.  and so if you don't mind, can you kind of recall that and how it led to this distinction that you made that I thought was interesting between belief that and belief in?

            "text": "Yeah, I was trying to make a point about something else at the end, and Cause I realized when it happened, I was working, when you were a homicide in our agency, you also work OISs.  Those are officer involved shootings.  And that means anytime I, uh, an officer discharges a weapon and hit someone, um, you have to go out and investigate it to make sure that all the protocol was in place beforehand.  And if it's not to document it, to make sure that the right things afterwards.  And so I get called out one night because this officer had pulled over a drunk driver.  We thought it was a drunk driver.  And, uh, He gets a guy out of the car and realizes this is a parolee who is a much different character than he thought that he was drunk, but he knew he had a handful.  And the parolee also was carrying a gun unbeknownst to the officer.  And in our state, back in those days, it's a little bit different now, but it used to be that if you were caught with a gun, you'd do a year.  And so this guy knew that just having possession, a parolee with a gun, would put him in jail for a year.  And he had just come out of jail.  He was on parole.  He didn't want to go back, so he decided as this officer was getting him out of the car that if it came down to it and the officer was going to discover this gun on him, he was going to have to kill the officer rather than go back to jail.  And, of course, that was eventually going to happen if he was going to be arrested for drunk driving.  So he really made a decision pretty early, I think, that he was going to kill the officer.  As a matter of fact, as the officer got ready to do what we call an FST, which is a field sobriety test, he told this guy to turn away from him so he could do a pat down search because he had a suspicion.  this guy was the kind of guy who would probably be carrying a gun.  And as this driver turned away from the officer, he turned around immediately and pointed the gun at the officer's chest.  And so the officer knew that he had kind of been caught off guard and he didn't have his hand on his gun yet.  He didn't have his gun drawn for sure.  And this guy is already pointing a gun at him.  Now, I go to these scenes after the fact.  And so clearly the guy survives it because he's talking to me about it.  And I have to kind of assess and go through the shoot scene.  And I can see everywhere where the bullets are hitting the ground, where the bullets are hitting the car, where the bullets are hitting everything.  And I'm looking at all that and I'm listening to his story.  And he, like me, we know that we wear equipment that will help us.  And we both know we're wearing bulletproof vests when we work.  They're small Kevlar vests that fit underneath our uniforms, and they're really helpful, of course.  We've seen them stop bullets.  We put them on the range on our targets, and we put them downfield, and we'll shoot them up close.  We'll shoot them at 10 yards.  We'll shoot them at 5 yards just to see if bullets will penetrate the vest, and we discover pretty quickly they don't.  I mean, it actually does its job.  Now, it's going to hurt.  It's going to push the vest in.  It's going to feel like you've been hit with a sledgehammer, but it's not going to penetrate the vest.  Um, and, and so as he stood there facing this, um, suspect who had already had the gun drawn on him, he, he decided, you know what, I don't have time to do much.  I could, he could try to like jump to the side or he was too far away to do like a takeaway maneuver.  So he was just stuck.  And he said, I just decided I'm just going to tense my stomach muscles and take the first couple of rounds until I get my gun out and return fire.  which if you think about it is a crazy, and this is all happening in a millisecond, right?

            "text": "Yeah, I thought when I was standing there, because by this time I was already a Christian, and I remember standing there listening to his story and thinking to myself, man, that defines for me the difference between believing that something is true and believing in something.  And he moved in that one second from one to the other.  And what's interesting about that is that All of us want to be able to have that kind of faith, right?  Belief in, not just believe that.  And I think it's belief in that truly saves you, trusting that thing to do for you, which you cannot do for yourself.  But how do we get there, right?  Well, one of the ways, I think if he didn't know, if he had not seen the vest stop bullets, he would not have stood still.  So there is a connection between your level of evidential... Certainty and your level of commitment in a time of crisis. ",

            "text": "And that happens for a lot of us.  And I've heard other philosophers and apologists talk about this idea that, hey, if you can know something is true at a point of intellectual certainty, and that's different for every person.  I get that.  But the point is if you can be certain intellectually that something is true, it will help you in a time of crisis when you feel like you want to jettison it.  But you know better because you had \u2013 and this is what was happening to him.  So I say the same thing for young people, especially in high school years, is we have to get to a place because someone's going to push that button.  Someone's going to do something that's going to shake or potentially could shake your faith.  And that's why I think it's so important for us to know that the vest stops bullets, to see that first.  And then when you come to that period of crisis, you're like, hey, I've already been there, done that.  I already know this can do the job.  I'm just going to be calm and still, and I'm not going to panic.  Thanks so much for watching our video.
