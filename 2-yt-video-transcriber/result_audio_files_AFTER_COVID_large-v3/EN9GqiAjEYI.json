            "text": "Now, the descriptions of God as man in the Old Testament prepare people, especially Jews, for this thinking, God in human form.  You know, we've had that already, but, you know, it was a challenge to them, especially since they rejected the Messiah.  They rejected Jesus to accept the idea that that was God.  He actually became a man.  Boy, we're in big trouble here.  I will come back to the fifth reference in a bit, but Jesus against this backdrop.  We've already alluded to this one.  I'm not going to belabor the point.  John 1.1, Jesus is the word of the Lord.  And the word was God.  Yep.  Again, you know, you'll get people who, you know, do backflips here to try to make John some sort of Platonic or, you know, Neo-Pythagorean or, you know, that's an anachronistic idea, but some sort of pagan philosopher, you know, imbiber, you know, an amateur philosopher here in pagan antiquity to get this idea.  No, John's just reading his Old Testament.  Not very complicated.  The Word became flesh.  Now this is important because in the Old Testament, it's one thing to have God show up visually as a human.  And in some cases, like in Jeremiah 1, it's even tactile.  The word of the Lord reached out his hand and touched my mouth, Jeremiah says.  It's quite another though to say that God became a man, was born of a woman, traveled through the birth canal, you know, all that.  The word became flesh.  That ups the ante.  Now, the descriptions of God as man in the Old Testament prepare people, especially Jews, for this thinking, God in human form.  You know, we've had that already, but, you know, it was a challenge to them, especially since they rejected the Messiah.  They rejected Jesus to accept the idea that that was God.  He actually became a man.  Boy, we're in big trouble here.  Okay, this ups the ante, the language, but the Old Testament idea of God as man, a Godhead, there's two there, the God, the invisible Yahweh who's everywhere, and then there's, you know, God also on earth, that prepared them for Jesus.  Click here, go to the next slide.  Jude 5.  Now, I want to remind you, although you once fully knew it, that Jesus, who saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed those who did not believe.  Wait a minute.  Who delivered Israel from Egypt?  Elohim, God, Yahweh, angel, the presence, Jesus.  Now, again, this is the New Testament writer applying Old Testament passages and thought to Jesus.  John 17, I have manifested your name to the people whom you gave me out of the world.  The name theology.  This doesn't mean that Jesus says, look, when I showed up, I taught everybody what God's name was.  They already knew that.  They have a Hebrew Bible.  Yahweh's in there a couple thousand times.  They have Exodus 3, I am that I am.  They don't need to know what God's name is.  That's not what he's talking about.  When he says, I have manifested your name to the people you gave me out of the world, or I kept them by your name.  He's not just whispering Yahweh over them.  I made known to them your name.  What is he talking about?  He's talking about something John says elsewhere in his gospel.  He that has seen me has seen the Father.  Okay, Jesus was the embodied name.  I've shown them who God is by virtue of being here.  Okay, I'm the name.  Doesn't Jesus say in John 10 that the Father is in me and I am in the Father?  Ooh, the Father in me, God, that sounds like a little bit like my name is in that, you know.  Again, this is the matrix of ideas.  When the gospel writers are writing this and Jesus is saying this, there's a framework already in place for their Jewish listeners to process what's being said.  Acts 5.41, they recounted the apostles that were persecuted.  They rejoiced that they were counted worthy to suffer dishonor for the name.  Yeah, it's for God, but it's also for Jesus.  For they have gone out for the sake of the name, accepting nothing from the Gentiles.  3 John.  See, Jesus gets referred to the same way that God got referred to in the Old Testament as the name.  Now, here's our fifth reference.  Remember the cloud rider, that this was a stock description of Baal, who no one questioned was an actual deity?  Not a sub-deity, a part-deity. ",
