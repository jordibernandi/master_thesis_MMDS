I'm sure you've heard about it over the last few weeks, but a flood alert has been raised near the Three Gorges Dam in China, the largest hydropower project in the world.  As the country grapples with its worst flooding in 70 years, Torrential rains have been causing havoc throughout the southwest and central regions of China this month.  With many rivers bursting their banks, prompting mass evacuations, as many as 400 million people may be at risk.  However, local media, Global Times, said experts have dismissed reports that the dam is at the brink of collapse.  Well, heavy rains over the past weeks have led to natural disasters being declared in 24 provinces and municipalities.  And that's a fact, especially areas near the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and the Three Gorges Dam.  Now, according to Asia Times Financial, this is the largest flooding since 1949 and has caused major problems to the dam, which is located in Sanping Town near Yichang in the Hubei Province.  Zhao Yunfa, the Deputy Chief Engineer of the Overflow Dispatch Communication Center at the Three Gorges Project, warned people, and he's pictured here, do not pin your hopes on the Three Gorges Dam, as its flood storage capacity is limited.  Approximately 400 million residents near the dam are now at risk.  Zhang Shuang, Director of the Three Gorges Corporation Hub Management Bureau, said, Flood control measures for the entire Yangtze River Basin could not depend on the dam to dominate the flood.  Now, that means they're going to be releasing huge amounts of water in undating cities, as pictured here.  As the flood continues, entire regions underwater.  This is a city here, completely surrounded by water.  Those are gigantic buildings.  High-rises.  The widespread severe flooding forces over 200,000 from their homes just last week.  And there are videos coming in showing massive flooding in South China near the Three Gorges dams.  And we have some of that footage.  The first video we're going to show you is a condominium floating down a river.  And no one even knows if there's people in it or not.  The people in China are being threatened by death for releasing this information, which is why it's so important to share it with the world.  Now, if you're wondering what that square box in the river is there, that is an entire multi-story condominium, probably 10 or 12 stories, floating down the center of the river.  Pretty amazing.  Now she was probably saying, can you believe a condominium is floating down the river?  That's insane.  This is a scene from a typical river, probably near Hubei.  Clearly some major damage, major flooding.  Now this last picture, this is actually a road on the edge of a cliff with a guardrail and There is a lot of water here.  I mean, a lot of water.  Let's blow this up.  And this is dumping into the area above the Three Gorges Dam.  So if this is a lot of water, and it's the most water that's been seen here in almost 80 years.  Let's just back this up.  That is just too cool for school and very deadly.  This is undercutting everything.  These homes are at risk.  A half a million people at risk in China currently.  And this is all due to the fact that for the last five to eight months, we have been in cosmic ray maximum, the likes of which modern man hasn't seen since the early 1800s, since the modern minimum, since the flooding back in 1931 in China.  And if you want to bone up on some of the science.  Here from Physics World, physicists claim further evidence of the link between cosmic rays and cloud formation.  More clouds, more rain.  Solar activity has a direct impact on Earth's cloud cover.  This is the work of Spensmark from the University of Denmark, as well as the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.  Both have linked large solar eruptions to changes in cloud cover, direct link to cosmic rays and cloud formation through nucleation.  Now let's talk about the 1931 China floods.  This is an equivalent flooding.  And when the levee broke, 150,000 people drowned.  Official reports found 140,000 drowned.  Similar occurrence will happen if the Three Gorges Dam collapses.  There is a half a million people downstream at risk of being taken out.  Now back in 1931, it was the beginning of this deep minimum from cycle 16 through before cycle 17 kicked off.  This was the cosmic ray flux that caused the flooding in 33.  This is the flooding that was caused in 43 here.  And this is the estimated line of our cosmic ray flux solar activity in pink.  And this is the observed in the last few years.  We are lower than we've ever been in modern human history.  That means more record flooding, the 100-year floods will continue, the destruction will continue, dams will continue to fail, our infrastructure and humanity will be put at risk.  Can you imagine the toxins in this water that this man is walking through?  Proper prior planning prevents piss-poor performance.  When the infrastructure is failing, when the plandemic is spreading, Fear is at an all-time high.  Are you growing food?  What are you doing to survive and thrive in the future?  Share this with like-minded people.  Subscribe to the channel if you haven't.  Be safe.  We love each and every one of you.  That's boom.  Three gorges dam at risk of failure.  We will report on it as the story unfolds. ",
