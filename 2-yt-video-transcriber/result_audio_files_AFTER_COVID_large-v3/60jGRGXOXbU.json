It's too dangerous for Venezuelan troops to enter, so they patrol the perimeter and train their rifles on any inmate who tries to leave.  The prisoners have formed functional, independent societies with open-air bazaars offering everything from Coca-Cola to cocaine.  Several days a week, they welcome their girlfriends, wives, children, and extended families for visits, birthday parties, and even festivals.  La Causa, a new documentary from 29-year-old filmmaker Andr\u00e9s Figueiredo Thompson, is a raw look at life inside what at the time of filming was the country's largest prison.  The film explores the structure of its self-organized society, where dissenters and those deemed social radicals were treated harshly, and LGBT inmates were cast out and forced to live on the roof of a building.  Figueiredo Thompson started capturing remarkable footage in the prison in 2010, as the socialist strongman president Hugo Chavez dismantled democratic institutions and seized control of private businesses.  The year after Figueiredo Thompson began production on La Causa, Chavez declared his stepfather an enemy of the state, forcing his family to flee to the U.S.  But he continued filming on return trips to Venezuela over the following eight years.

It's really strange to see when a man that you've seen your entire life be, you know, a completely moral man be thrown out of his country for speaking the truth.  If you didn't question your beliefs, if you're dogmatic about your beliefs, then there's no room for you to admit error.  And I think that's a lot of what's happening in Venezuela is that there's no admittance of error.  And they've gone so far down a path that It's very hard to come back from when you become too radicalized in your ideological position.  And I think, you know, that's something that I've been able to witness and to see firsthand.  And it's very saddening. ",
