Everyone is being forced to make difficult decisions, and our families, including our kids, are bearing the brunt of it.  But we really don't have to.  Governor, I'm sure you're familiar with the IDEA, but for the folks at home, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, IDEA is the federal law that requires schools to provide services to children with disabilities, sometimes called learning differences.  The federal government, as you know, splits this funding when the states.  When the IDEA was passed, the federal government promised to fund 40%.  Yet the closest we've gotten in recent years in 2019 was 13.8%.  So I've been helping my third grade daughter with homework.  And what I think we can definitely say is that 13.8% is not equal to 40%, leaving our states with a big shortfall.  In California last year, we under, funded this program by about $22 billion nationally.  And so has Minnesota ever gotten full funding from the federal government for the IDEA?  We have not.  Would it help you if you did? ",
