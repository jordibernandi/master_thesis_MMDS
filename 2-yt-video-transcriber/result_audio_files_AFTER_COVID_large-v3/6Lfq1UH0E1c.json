So yeah, let us begin that one.  Embarking on the journey to discover your gender identity might be one of the most important challenges you undertake during your lifetime.  Understanding why it is so challenging can help it become more manageable, simpler, and less overwhelming.  Fear.  Why does it have to be there?  We all hide.  In other words, repress, as we psychotherapy types like to call it, essential parts of ourselves that we might have been taught to be ashamed and or afraid of.  Our unconscious takes care of repressing these aspects for us, and it is actually really good at it.  That's because our unconscious thinks its main job is to keep us from harm.  When we were children, our unconscious helped us push down anything we believed to be too shameful or wrong about who we really were.  We did this by tossing these thoughts, feelings and memories into a heavily padlocked trunk that resides in our psyche.  We then threw it into the deepest ocean we could find.  We thought if we got rid of the trunk and everything in it, then somehow our lives would become easier and everyone would like and accept us.  Here's the thing.  The ocean that you threw that trunk into is your unconscious.  This means the trunk and all of its contents have been with you all along.  You may or may not remember creating this trunk of secrets.  You may have begun the process of filling the trunk at a young age, or you may have been older.  You might have just a few things in it, or it could be completely stuffed.  Regardless of your story, it's very likely there's at least something in that trunk that needs to be looked at.  It could be causing you anything from confusion and uncertainty to paralyzing fear and distress.  The presence of fear means you're getting closer to discovering something about yourself.  This is because we oftentimes fear the unknown, and it is unknown as to what you will dig out of your trunk of secrets.  Calling out your fears.  The trunk of secrets you will uncover through the use of this guidebook are the ones having to do with your gender identity.  This doesn't mean other trunk secrets won't come spilling out during the process, but it's less overwhelming to focus on one at a time.  In stage two reflection, you're going to look at when you first began to feel conflicted about your gender identity, what happened to you, what happened as you became more aware of this, and why you ended up having to put those thoughts and feelings into that trunk.  For right now, let's reach into that trunk and nudge that secret just a little bit.  Get out your pen and paper. ",
