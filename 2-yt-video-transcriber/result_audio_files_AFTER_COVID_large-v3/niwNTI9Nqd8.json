But if you're a worker, especially a gig worker, there's a very good chance you're out of luck.  If you do need to see a doctor for care, there's a good chance.  no one's going to help you pay if you aren't covered.  And if you want to heed the public health warnings to stay home from work, there's also a chance that you won't get paid.  Of course, you still need to pay your rent and all of your debts, medical student credit card, mortgage.  The results are predictable.  Too many sick people have no choice but to go to work, which means more people contracting and spreading the virus.  And without comprehensive bailouts for workers, we can expect more bankruptcies and more homelessness down the road.  Look, we know this script.  In 2008, the last time we had a global financial meltdown, the same kinds of bad ideas for no-strings-attached corporate bailouts carried the day.  And regular people around the world paid the price.  And even that was entirely predictable.  13 years ago, I wrote a book called The Shock Doctrine, The Rise of Disaster Capitalism.  It described a brutal and recurring tactic by right-wing governments.  After a shocking event, a war, coup, terrorist attack, market crash, or natural disaster, they exploit the public's disorientation, suspend democracy, push through radical free market policies that enrich the 1% at the expense of the poor and middle class.  But here is what my research has taught me.  Shocks and crises don't always go the shock doctrine path.  In fact, it's possible for crisis to catalyze a kind of evolutionary leap.  Think of the 1930s when the Great Depression led to the New Deal.  The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.  In the United States and elsewhere, governments began to weave a social safety net so that the next time there was a crash, there would be programs like Social Security to catch people.  Right of every family to a decent home.  the right to adequate medical care, and the opportunity to achieve and enjoy good health.  Look, we know what Trump's plan is.  A pandemic shock doctrine featuring all the most dangerous ideas lying around.  From privatizing Social Security to locking down borders to caging even more migrants.  Hell, he might even try canceling elections.  But the end of this story hasn't been written yet.  It is an election year, and social movements and insurgent politicians are already mobilized.  And like in the 1930s, we have a whole bunch of other ideas lying around. ",
