            "text": "In 2016, Rob Portman blocked a new Supreme Court judge saying the people should get a voice in an election year.  This nominee is better to have this occur after we pass this presidential election.  Now, days before the election, Portman supports rushing through a new judge, but he's refusing to pass COVID relief to help struggling families and businesses in Ohio.  Call Portman and tell him to pass COVID relief now and let the people's voice be heard on the Supreme Court.  Rob Portman is letting Ohio down.  Thank you. ",
