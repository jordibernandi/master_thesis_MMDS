            "text": "A lot of times whenever I talk about Thought Slime, he's a pretty prominent breadtuber, you've probably heard of him.  Anytime I bring him up on stream, it's almost always in a negative way.  I say, oh, fuck Thought Slime.  And then when that video goes up on YouTube, I get a bunch of comments saying, Xanderhal, why do you hate Thought Slime so much?  I know he's a little bit cringe on Twitter sometimes, but I like his videos.  He seems like a pretty cool dude.  Why do you hate Thought Slime?  And I want to respond to every single one of these comments, but I get dozens of them, sometimes hundreds of them.  And there is no way that I can put into a short... um youtube or twitter response the kind of shit that thought slime has pulled with me that has led to me hating this dude because i do hate thought slam.  i think he's a bad person.  um and really quick i want to clarify.  thought slime is non-binary but prefers he him pronouns.  so that's why i'm using he him pronouns.  just want to clarify that.  make that very very clear.  so let's get into it.  So back in April, early May, late April, some drama happened where me and a group of friends, none of them of which were fans, as I should clarify, decided to make a group chat on Discord where we would talk about video games and TV and stuff like that.  And there was an NSFW section where we could like horny post and things like that.  It was not a big deal.  It was super chill.  I made a whole video about it right here because, and we'll get into why I had to make this video in a minute.  Watch this video.  Seriously.  Watch the video if you want to learn all the context.  I'm not gonna get super into it here.  Please do.  It's filled with fucking screenshots and everything.  I added an entire fucking archive here of screenshots to, like, prove my innocence.  It's pretty substantial, okay?  Go watch the video, alright?  Regardless.  Hey, vermin.  Regardless, though.  Why do I hate Thought Slime?  Some drama happened in between me and my friends, well, specifically her, and my friends within the, um, within our, our group chat, right?  And she ended up leaving and going to Twitter to write a massive thread about how I'm, like, a, like, a liar and an abuser and blah blah blah blah blah.  Now, everybody else involved has since stepped, like, come out to, um, to, you know, condemn this girl and say, no, she's lying, right?  Now, Thought Slime, on the other hand... The day this drama started happening came out with this Twitter thread.  So let's go over it.  There's a very specific reason why I emphasize that YouTubers should not date their fans, but I didn't think we would arrive at the sex cult portion of the danger quite so quickly.  On cue, we get the dudes who think we need more dispassionate nuance in the should we run a sex cult discourse.  So, like, arguing against those... who are like saying, hey, it's not a sex cult.  Then Riley Grace or Sean, who is awesome, responds, I'm lacking context.  Is this referencing Xander Hall?  Yup.  The situation is messy to be sure, but calling it a sex cult is dishonest hyperbole.  No, it isn't actually.  So like doubling down hard.  On it being a sex cult.  Multiple times saying that I have a sex cult.  Over and over.  And the funny thing is, this didn't even line up with, um, uh, uh, with the accusation coming from, uh, the girl who made this accusation towards me at the time.  Oh, Riley Grace is in chat as well.  Um, this didn't even line up with, oh yeah, by the way, you guys should all go watch Riley Grace.  Riley Grace's content, thousand times better than Thought Slime.  Go and sub from Thought Slime and subscribe to Riley Grace for Sean, she's awesome.  Um, uh, um, but yeah, as I said, um, so he doubled in, like, he doubled down on this shit.  Like, he was hard-pressed on, like, the sex cult thing.  And the funny thing is, he didn't even, like, there was no reason for him to believe that I had a sex cult, right?  Like, he pulled this out of... Nowhere, guys, like nowhere.  The accusation from this girl at the time was that I was in a relationship with her and I promised her a place to live and all that, which I didn't, I've already disproved that claim, but that was her claim at the time.  Thoughtslime's the one who saw this and came up with sex cult from it.  It's almost like he already disliked me for some reason, and decided and, like, pulled some conspiracy out of his ass to justify his hatred of me.  And, you know, this ended up getting about 3,000 likes, and he blocked me.  He blocked me before making this tweet to make sure I can't, like, I couldn't defend myself or anything in the threat, right?  Just to guarantee that nobody can push back on his bullshit here.  However... the girl that made this accusation towards him, or towards me, I should say, actually went to Thought Slime and said, please don't call it that, because it went against her narrative that she was trying to push at the time, that, like, we were in a relationship and I promised her the world and all of that, right?  And so he came out with another thread, saying, Should I have used the term sex cult?  Evidently not.  That's against the wishes of the person who brought this scandal to light.  I'm sorry to have done that and upset them.  However, the fact that my phrasing has become the takeaway here is a very obvious redirect.  So, no.  Having a sex cult is... borderline like a crime.  right like having a like.  a cult like a sex cult where i presumably you like groom people into a uh into a relationship like that is a crime.  i'm pretty sure he was more or less accusing me of a crime here Then following it up with, I will not accept equivocation of my poor phrasing when calling out abuse and the abuse itself.  There was no abuse.  If anything, the abuse is coming from the girl who did this, as is the testimony of everybody else involved.  There is a massive gap in severity between our perspective and poor judgment.  So he's just making excuses for himself here.  God, my nose is itchy.  From here, I just kind of, like, disliked Thought Slime after this.  I was like, wow, he's kind of a piece of shit, kind of, like, irresponsible.  But he made a mistake, and he's too, like, spineless to, like, apologize for it and admit that he did something wrong.  Okay, that's fine.  But the reason why I ended up making... this uh video was because people confronted him about this as time went by during his black lives matter charity stream a fan of his donated and said hey are you going to apologize to xander hall for lying about him?  um it was a simple mistake.  but you should probably apologize because you know i made the video literally debunking all these accusations towards me.  um quite substantially i would say like i had a whole fucking novel's worth of screenshots and you know what he did.  you know what thought slime did on that stream when someone asked him that He leaned into his mic and said, no.  Just straight up refused.  And then yesterday, and this is what made me make my video.  This is what made me do this.  Yesterday, he tripled down on it.  Tripled down.  He tweeted, it'd be a lot easier for me to go to, to left, to me to left.  go, I think he means let go, of left tube drama if the people I'm trying to ignore would just leave me alone instead of constantly escalating the conflict and sending their dipshit fans to harass me wherever I go.  He's probably referring to Mirvash here, probably me.  Um, then one of, somebody responds, apologize to Xanderhal, then like a shrug, and he responds, sorry I offended your favorite creep.  Is it fair to interpret this as being a triple down now?  Like he still fully stands by what he said?  I think we can agree on that.  So for starters, it'd be a lot easier for me to let go of LeftTubeDrama if the people I'm trying to ignore would just leave me alone.  Okay.  If ignoring someone is like, making a baseless accusation about somebody who has a much smaller platform than you, and lying about them, then yeah, sure, that's trying to ignore them, right?  No, I'm not escalating the conflict by holding you responsible for the shit that you say and the misinformation that you've spread.  Also, I don't encourage my fans to harass you.  I'm just telling people what happened.  If they choose to go out of their way to say, hey, you should apologize or to unsub from you because of that, so be it.  Even though Vosh has encouraged or defended fans harassing TS, I bet they still would say he, um, even though he's just proven of it.  Yeah, probably.  I mean, I thought Slime's a piece of shit.  Sorry I offended your favorite creep.  Well, I mean, I went through the video.  Literally nothing that I did was, like, creepy.  So, I mean, if... Like, go watch the video.  Go see the screenshots.  Make up your own judgment.  But in my opinion, nothing I did was even borderline creepy.  So, this is more or less just Thought Slime... This is just Thought Slime tripling down.  Now, I used to think that... I used to think that Thought Slime was just kind of dumb, and maybe he made a mistake, and I'm just not gonna watch Thought Slime's content anymore because it's not for me, and I don't- I'm not in good terms with the person behind it, but... Thought Slime's, like, a legitimate piece of shit.  How old is Thought Slime?  Like, at least 30, right?  Thought Slime's gotta be at least in his late 20s, early 30s, right?  Grown-ass fucking NB, right?  Falsely accusing a 20-year-old with a much smaller platform after blocking them so they can't defend themselves of basically a crime.  Fuck Thought Slime.  Fuck them.  This is why I hate Thought Slime.  For all of you guys who have asked me numerous times in the past, Sander Hall, why do you hate Thought Slime?  This is just the reason why I personally hate Thought Slime.  I didn't like him before.  There are plenty of reasons not to like Thought Slime.  His cringy fucking Twitter behavior, the whole drama he had with Bosh and how he handled that, just generally his disposition online.  I do not like Thought Slime.  Or I didn't like Thought Slime.  Now I hate him, and this is why.  So yeah, more or less, this is my reasoning for why I dislike him.  So you guys can stop asking me in the comments, why do you dislike Thought Slime?  This is why.  He's a piece of shit.  Like a legitimately bad person. ",
