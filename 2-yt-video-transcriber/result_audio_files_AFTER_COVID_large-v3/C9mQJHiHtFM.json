            "text": "Okay, Lynette, do you think that the IMF or the Bank of International Settlements, now that basically the Fed is out of the game, it can do QE, it can expand its balance sheet, but it's not going to consider negative rates.  Do you believe that the IMF or the World Bank or the Bank of International Settlements will open a line of credit or just do a direct loan to either the Treasury or or to central banks, especially the Fed, and blanket this entire thing with like a $10 trillion.  Because on Monday, like a day before this interview, if the Fed hadn't dropped that bomb and gone into the repo markets with hundreds of billions, the entire credit facility would have been \u2013 Yes, in the trillions.  And not only that, but it seemed to me like the world could not have bought more treasury.  It would have gone to gold yesterday had the Fed not intervened.  You know, I want to talk a little bit about how this is all priced into the stock market, or is it not yet priced all the way fully?  Are we going to the lows of the Trump era?  You know, the November 6th, 2016, the 1800s for the S&P 500.  Are we going even lower?  There are many, many speculators out there on what's going to happen.  Do you feel that we're even close to a bottom? ",

            "text": "No, I do not feel that we're close to a bottom.  I just pulled a graph up when we were about, I think, 18% below on the S&P from the highs.  And it was still severely overvalued, like a price earnings ratio of almost 28 times earnings when the average is 15.  And I was there on Black Monday in 1987.  And at that time, you had blue chip stocks that we're trading at eight and 12 times earnings.  So I know, I don't think we're near a bottom.  Now, having said that, with all this helicopter money and all of these trillions and trillions and trillions of dollars worth of liquidity, here's the thing about that.  I would expect a V-shaped recovery, right?  But what happened?  when he announced, when Powell announced 1.5 trillion on Sunday night, the markets went limit down.  In other words, they dropped, all of them dropped about 7% instantly, where?  if they had any ammunition, if they were really effective in anything, they should have gone through the moon.  because once new money is created, it has to go someplace.  And that brings up, you know, that brings up that black hole because where are all those trillions?  And then on Monday he announced an additional 500 billion.  And we are now at a point.  In fact, I just was looking at it this morning where all the promises in the repo market, look at them.  It is Q E to infinity.  They are prepared to create as much new money as the banks are demanding, as the hedge funds are demanding, as the larger corporations are demanding.  And it'll be so interesting to see what they're coming up with for the little guy.  Yeah, they're going to send a check.  And according, I listened to the whole thing this morning.  And they said it's going to be bigger.  Of course, President Trump always has a tendency to do that.  It's going to be bigger than anything we've ever seen.  Well, Hong Kong just recently. ",
