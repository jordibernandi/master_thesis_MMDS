            "text": "Thank you.  These women range in every body type and everything.  They're all successful, they're all intelligent, they're all good people.  But if all of these women, including myself, are having issues, then I have to think... it might not be us it might be you it might be men it might be men.  now i've often talked about the of america and how men are no longer men.  i talked to my mom about this a lot and she says well maybe it's just the guys in texas maybe it's just the guys in los angeles maybe it's just the guys It is not just the guys in Los Angeles, Nashville, Dallas, and they're not any better in the Midwest.  Quite frankly, I think they're trash all over this country in the age range of about 20 to I think about 55, maybe even 60.  A lot of men are trash.  A lot of men don't know how to treat women.  A lot of men don't know how to really, quite frankly, pull their heads out of the sand and pay attention.  So I am going to help you.  All right.  I keep getting requests to actually do a video on Tommy Lauren and her saying that men are trash.  And there's two reasons that I really didn't want to do.  it is one, she's white.  And even though she's white, unless she says something really egregious or Force men or something in general that don't usually talk about them Because I'm even though I do from time to time do MGTOW content.  That's not normally my aim and other than her being angry saying men are trash She really didn't say anything that any other woman hasn't said before and about dating rules.  so I looked at it.  I still wasn't going to do it because it wasn't very interesting or fascinating.  Even though, I guess, if you're going to be on YouTube, some celebrity says something, then it's going to get views and people kind of pile in.  That ain't what I do here.  I went on ahead and did some research to find out if there was an angle that actually interested me.  And after looking at her background, it really wasn't much, but looking at her boyfriend's background, all of a sudden I got an interest and all of a sudden I got a hit.  And with Brandon Frick and his relationship with her actually made sense.  Because we have to start not from the after effect, but what caused this, how can I say, dust up with Tommy Lauren?  Because all I was was frustration.  I'm sure it was.  All I was was frustration.  Had nothing to do with the lockdown.  All I was was frustration.  Okay.  Let's go back to who Brandon Frick is.  Brandon Frick was a, or is still probably a sports agent.  I think he's 28.  I do believe he's 28 years old, lives in Hermosa Beach, and happens to have her for a quote-unquote girlfriend.  All that is well and good.  It kind of makes sense.  They're kind of in the same vein.  He's a decent-looking guy, not bad, not completely, you know, like, regularly handsome, not a pro football player type, but... He's all right.  And so the two of them make a decent couple.  She's all right.  He's all right.  So I was looking into his background about when they got engaged.  And so lo and behold, they got engaged like.  I think it's June of last year.  And after they got engaged, he started his run for Congress as an independent.  Makes sense.  OK, you know, get engaged.  Making plans to run for Congress.  Your girlfriend or your fiance is a pundit.  Is she on Fox?  I think she's on Fox where she talks about politics and stuff like that.  So you guys have the same flavor.  You guys have the same interests.  Sports is basically entertainment.  and if you're a sports agent you're basically a entertainment agency basically.  so there's no difference in them being an agent for nfl quarterback or tommy lawrence.  so there's a lot of crossover.  so he's he's with her they're now still in love and he's running for congress makes sense.  then just before the primaries in california which is in March, he drops out.  Brandon is an independent in Hermosa Beach.  He drops out.  LA is a tough market.  Tough market for anybody, especially against an incumbent.  and you're an independent.  Unless you got a whole lot to say, your odds are pretty slim.  And it wasn't that he was defeated in the primary.  He actually canceled his run.  Maybe he ran out of money.  Maybe he didn't have any backing.  I didn't really get the gist about what the background was.  It's kind of hard with an independent, with a... A party person, then you kind of know.  Now, normally you would think that somebody like him with a girlfriend, like a fiancee like his, he'd be a Republican, but evidently he couldn't get one of those slots.  So he ran as an independent.  All well and good.  First step, Congress.  Okay.  The thing is you drop out.  Now, given all of that, it still doesn't hit your radar, right?  But the very next month, About a month later, she, not he, she cancels the engagement.  Says it's not in the cards.  Now, you've known this guy for a couple years.  You get engaged to him, and you were engaged to him for approximately nine months.  And right after he... ends his run for Congress, you cancel the engagement, give him his ring back.  And you say that it's, it wasn't, the time was not right.  She wasn't ready.  It's not in the cards.  Yeah.  Very good excuse, but I'm not buying it.  Come on girl.  You know, doggone well, this was a political arrangement and you were going to be a political wife.  You know, had he won, uh, and got into Congress, y'all probably would have gotten married, had a couple kids, he'd help him stay in office, he'd rise through the ranks, maybe become a senator.  Who knows?  Within 20 years, he'd be Barack Obama trying to run for president, which is probably something that you envision.  When he doesn't get defeated but cancels his run, And I don't know what went back and forth.  It could have been anything.  But the tea leaves.  tell me that this was a political marriage from the get-go.  You're a high 92 in the political realm, and this is your ticket.  And you're his ticket.  So those two paths align.  You guys are in the same flavor.  It makes sense.  Your portfolio matches his portfolio.  It's all good.  When that's over, guess what?  He really doesn't have a need for a political wife.  Basically, he's not a politician anymore.  You don't have any need for him because he doesn't suit your ambitions.  So you cancel it.  It's over.  Now you're a free agent again.  You get dumped back onto the market.  You got to find a team.  And you have to find a team during what?  Corona.  You gotta find a high value 92 dude running for Congress or something similar in that vein right during coronavirus, right during the lockdown, especially when sports and entertainment is cut off, right?  So all those 100 octane dudes can't afford all those eights, nines, and tens that they had on a string because eights, nines, and tens are expensive, especially if you're a dude at that level.  So all these, what she calls Tatianas, or Fatianas as she calls them, them eight nines and tens, them gold, the gold digger class of which she's part of, a gold digger class.  It's dumped back onto the market.  Now the competition is fierce.  And all those dudes that were available because you work in that industry, they ain't available anymore.  But why?  Because they're dealing with all these 21, 22, 23-year-old Tatianas one of which you probably were when you were that age, because now Tatianas are cheap.  They're available and they're plentiful.  The supply is high and the demand is low.  And like Kevin says, you're a forever six.  You're not an eight, nine or 10.  And you're a six, a six, maybe even six plus.  that has passed her peak.  So now you're talking value, value, value, which is your saving grace.  She's a high 92 working around high 92 dudes and 100 octane dudes.  But just like B. Simone, she can't get one of those.  Why?  Because it looks why she doesn't qualify.  Looks why she's not young enough.  And if she can't sell herself as value, in other words, I can help you in some kind of way.  As a high 92, they don't need her.  So now she was engaged.  She's taken off the market as a used car.  She gets dumped back onto the market in the worst possible environment for a high 92 to be dumped in.  The competition is fierce.  And all those chairs are probably already taken.  So now she's going out on dates and they're not going anywhere.  So instead of her being the belle of the balls, she's a BB.  Be easy, bring beer.  She doesn't like being treated like a BB.  Because she has value.  And I'm not saying that she doesn't.  Because all of the things that she says that these guys should be, or the kind of guys that she's looking for, to be productive, to be passionate, to have a little aggression, and be the kind of high 92 or 100 octane guy that she's looking for.  Her and her friends are looking for.  But those guys are fewer in number.  And as the monetary... The economic climate actually gets cut in half.  A lot of those guys get taken off the market.  They ain't got the money for this kind of stuff.  They don't have the money to risk.  And in this climate, you can't really help them.  So you and your friends are stuck.  So I'm sure all you guys are all crying in your beer right now because the guys you used to have access to that would kiss your ass, would take you out, aren't doing it because they have other things.  Better looking women actually occupy their time.  And your value has dropped.  So you're pissed.  I'm 27 years old.  Life's not over.  I've had access to high value men in the past, but now I have to, me, Tommy Lauren has to go out and compete with the Tatianas out there.  And I have a name, a position and value.  How dare they?  So I'm gonna go online and I'm actually gonna use my bully pulpit to demand that I get these kind of guys.  Demand that these kind of guys treat me this kind of way.  And the ones that are a little bit lower, On the scale, not quite the high 92s, but a build-a-boo that I might be willing to take on.  You're going to have to have these qualities.  And so she listed them, and she was frustrated.  So that kind of spilled out.  Normally, white women don't do this in public.  Like Kevin says, it's normally a black woman that will do it because black women really don't have respect for their men.  So they don't give a shit.  Black women don't give a shit.  They don't have respect for their men.  Hell, sometimes they don't even like their men.  What white women do normally because they know they have to normally.  So the reason that this is a kerfuffle is because this is kind of out of character for most white women.  Common for black women, out of character for most white women.  Even though she tried to walk it back, it still stands.  Well, let's you know, the stuff that she says wasn't wrong.  OK, if you're going to date.  Women like her and her friends, which are high 92 women.  OK, you do have to be upfront and honest.  They are not in the business to date married men.  That's a bad look on their careers and it's a bad look for them.  So they want single guys with no kids.  because you're looking for a, you know, especially at 27, they're looking for a permanent relationship.  number two they don't want to play the online text game the online tumblr game the online whatever game dating app game.  they don't do that shit right.  they network high 92s like that especially that level.  network a friend of a friend of a friend.  i met you at a party at a gathering.  all kinds of different little events they go to.  That's what they do.  That's how they.  they network person to person.  And once they network person to person, everything is done in person.  They court the old fashioned way.  They don't go to do this cheap and easy crap that millennials and younger called dating.  Dating apps are not dating.  Just like the Yellow Pages is not going to the store.  And at their level, they don't do that.  They do everything person to person.  They do it the old fashioned way because that's what works.  That's how you network.  That's how you get to know people.  That's how you court.  That's how you date.  So if you're texting them all day long, it doesn't mean anything.  You're on the phone.  You're bugging them.  Text or actually relay information from people that they know that they need to have action on it.  If you're not one of those, it's not one of those things they don't care about.  Good morning.  How are you?  Give them a call.  or you make like she says make a plan.  third one make a plan.  take me on a date take me someplace call me over to hang out.  don't wait till the last second.  that's what they do.  you're gonna date a high 92 like her and her friends.  this is what you got to do.  she was actually telling you the truth.  the last thing was that they want be ambitious.  even if you're a build-a-boo or build a 92, a businessman, a corporate dude, PhD, whatever you are in that range, if you want a person like her and her friends, they're not just there to actually look good and screw, or date and be on your arm and have a really good time.  They're ambitious people.  They want to build a life, just like she said.  We want to build a life.  We want to be on magazines.  We want the nice house and the summer home and the nice vacations and careers.  I got one.  You got to have one.  Meld those two things together.  Become a power couple, which is what most 92s want at that level, especially high 92s.  They want power couple.  They want the Jay-Z and Beyonce.  They want the Michelle and Barack.  That's what they want.  They want the Brangelina.  They want the power couple.  That's the lifestyle they envision.  They work very hard for it.  They will work very hard to get you in position.  They want you to be the go-to person.  They want you to be the vehicle.  I'm going to help you.  I'm going to put gas in the car.  I'm going to clean the windows.  I'm going to clean the inside.  But guess what?  You're the car.  You got to get us there.  So according to what the level that she's at, the level that her friends are, the contacts that she has, The things that she can provide, not only you and your career, but also your family, that's what she wants.  Now, the all men are trash, that's just frustration.  Normally, white women don't say that.  Black women say it all the time.  But that's her frustration because... She had the dude that she probably wanted or could work with, but his career didn't pan out.  And basically it was a contract.  He couldn't fulfill his part of the contract.  So she was out.  Got to go find me another one.  Got to go reload.  Come back into an environment that is full of sharks and extremely competitive.  So it ain't just the black women.  Trust and believe everybody's going through it.  So if somebody like Tommy Lauren is frustrated because she can't get the dudes in her sector, that means everybody's getting pushed down.  So every woman that's in America, in her sector, competition is really, really fierce.  And her frustration is an indicator.  She's famous.  She's on TV.  She's got a track record.  She's decent looking.  And she's frustrated.  Guess what?  All the chicks beneath her, they're frustrated too.  Environment, environment, environment.  That's all she's responding to.  Her environment.  And the environment is tough and she's frustrated.  And that primal scream... That's really what it was.  That's a primal scream because shit ain't working.  And that all men are trash video basically is a primal scream.  That's all it is.  Scream of frustration.  So I don't even know what dudes are worried about.  I'd be laughing.  But with that, I'm going to jump off of here.  I hope this serves as my explanation of Tommy Lauren.  So put it in the books.  Stop asking me.  This is BGS out and I'll see you guys on the next one.
