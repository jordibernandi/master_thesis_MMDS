            "text": "We are not the final arbiters of any man or woman's final destiny.  I think that's, to me that is a supremely important thing to grasp.  So, we have relatively poor measures to understand all that God does in the lives of people who sin.  And there are very grievous sins clearly that Christians commit.  What Scripture does say is constantly to urge us not to receive the grace of God in vain in our lives.  In the way we understand how God's grace works, God's grace always reigns through righteousness in our lives.  And in a sense, it seems to me to be our chief responsibility not to speculate about what may happen if.  but to respond to our own sin the way Scripture encourages us to respond to it, and that is to resist it with all our might and men.  It is possible to commit grievous sins like Simon Peter.  My own conviction is if you'd bumped into Simon Peter, on the evening of Christ's crucifixion and then bumped into Judas Iscariot, you would not have been able to tell the difference, not have been able to tell the difference.  What made the difference was the intercession of Christ for Simon Peter that led to his repentance.  And again and again in Scripture, Hebrews chapter 6 is a notable example.  It's possible to experience many aspects of the power of the kingdom of God, and yet apparently, as I understand that passage, not actually to experience salvation, not to experience salvation because he says, we're persuaded of better things of you, and there what Hebrews is urging on us Do not mistake the things that accompany salvation in your life for the reality of repentance towards God and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.  So I think these two things are what give us balance.  We're not the final judge of anyone's life.  We don't know what happens in the secret places of their minds even when they sin in their last breath.  But we do have a responsibility for ourselves.  And this, I think, is how Jesus responds to that kind of question.  Just, you know, are there going to be many who will be saved or many who will be lost?  Make sure you are.  And I think when we do that, we refocus on the things that are central and we know that the judge of all the earth does right. ",
