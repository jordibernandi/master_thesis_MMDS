            "text": "Good evening, friends.  Stephen Bonin with Israeli News Live, and we do have a flurry, flurry, flurry of issues going on with the Earth's crust, and not just here in the United States.  I want to do thank John Brown.  He originally sent this to me about Dutch Sense.  I know he watches this man quite a bit, and This guy is definitely on top of his game about what's going on, the hot spots that he found.  I watched the video a couple of days ago as I was making some rounds there, and it was catching my attention.  Why is the earth heating up and stuff, right?  This is actually the video that I saw there on October the 7th that Dutch Sense had put out there, and He goes in quite lengthy there about the the earthquakes.  things are the excuse me, the heating up of the earth, things like that that are happening.  And, and without even going into the details about what he says on here, and I'm going to kind of let me see, I want to kind of get into one spot here with you on this.  Let me find it here.  I think this is it right here.  Yeah, let me just play just a little clip of what he says here.  And then I'm being contacted by people high up in government circles there, two of them from the Pentagon, as well as from the FEMA engineer, the friend of mine, I know him.  and the information that is being passed down to him.  And I got another message only moments ago as I was preparing this broadcast about the shifting of the crust of the earth and of course i put out another request trying to find out what do they think is causing this.  uh but i brought up dutch sense here his video.  i want to play a little clip of what he says here because i know world governments are very concerned because this is going global.  it's not just the united states it is a global shift.  and i'm going to be talking about the places i'm being told but The female engineer, he let me know today.  I'd gotten a message from him.  Actually, let's see, yesterday, he says, Hello, Steve, I'm so sorry it's taken so long to get back with you.  I had one assignment after the other.  To answer your questions about the crust movement, yes, I have been told that the New Madrid fault line has become very active.  They're extremely concerned and they believe it can go any day.  Now, as well as the Cascadia fault line didn't get much information in terms of what is causing the new Madrid, it's certainly starting to raise a lot of eyebrows.  And that was kind of where the text message end there with him.  But my Pentagon source independently had already reached out to me about this.  So let me just first play this clip here from Dutch Sense, what he says, so you can kind of get the picture of where we're going on this.  to come up and all of these little vibrations they do have magnitudes assigned to them.  and look at the magnitudes.  they're in the mid-range ones the right side of your screen.  he's going down 2.4. it's not just small movement it's not just zeros it's ones and twos now.  so while they do have magnitudes assigned to this this is more like vibrating as the plate is shifting.  and this is major vibration as the plate is majorly shifting compared to where we were.  let's go back a day in Washington, but it all hinges on this.  This is the Juan de Fuca fracture zone out to the west, which we can see on the USGS plate foundry map here.  The jagged edges, actually these jagged edges belong to the Pacific plate, the greater Pacific plate here.  And so they're... Let me see, I'll move forward just a little bit here.  And then they point in like arrows, coming in from down below and going up into the plate.  This is shifting.  This is going on right now.  This is yesterday.  I don't know what today is going to be on this chart, but 500 is.  And we're swarming out and we're getting hot spots breaking out along those areas where fires are taking place along those areas and heat is being released.  That's what's going on.  Nobody can tell me.  When Dutch sends here, when he speaks about the hotspots, when I was watching his video just the other day, it's very interesting because he literally caught it while it was happening.  While he was actually monitoring this, you could see the ground, the hotspot heat up almost 1,000 degrees.  I can't fathom that.  I just can't.  I can't fathom that at all.  But this is what he was doing.  Now, just moments ago.  All right.  Let me let me kind of update you on some more.  This is from my FEMA source.  And by the way, we're going to be going later.  Some of these right wingers there, they've got themselves another rising star.  His name is Dana.  I won't go into it too much about this guy here, but be wary.  You got to watch these people that start doing all these prophecies here.  A lot of time they're inside government sources and they're getting this information and they're making them look like they have prophetic insight.  they're only being told what's going to happen as they prepare these things.  so no these people are not prophets.  they don't have gifts of prophecy they just get information kind of like i do.  the only difference is i'm honest about it whereas there is a mission for these types of people not going to go into any more information about that just letting you know be advised be warned.  Anyway, found out more information on the hot spots.  The New Madrid has several hot spots along the southeast Missouri and Arkansas line.  Apparently, this activity has caused severe alarm.  The movement is unprecedented, and they've never seen anything like it before.  Now, by the way, this all got started because Adam with Marfugo News there, he had posted on his Twitter page there that there were troops being moved out west.  and i didn't want to report it until he could get some clarification on it.  so i sent a message there to some friends there in the pentagon found out that yes it was true but it has to do with this seismic activity now.  at first i thought this was meaning oh well Well, maybe that was just code phrases.  You know, sometimes these guys talk to you code phrase, you know, something's going to be going on, but it's really not an earthquake.  It's something different altogether.  But no, it actually is dealing.  By the way, I just saw his map there.  This is that map he did on the heating of the earth there.  So maybe it'll show up there while we just kind of hovering over it there.  There it is right there.  Look at there.  See that right there in the middle there.  We're right there on the Missouri-Tennessee border there.  Actually Missouri and I think that is Mississippi border.  There it is.  There it is.  It darkens up right in there, the ground.  That is where the ground was heating up.  Amazing work this guy has done.  Really amazing.  I'm very appreciative of his work.  But anyway... Moving on, though, the troops are being repositioned because, as I was told, there is a greater than 70% chance of a major, major earthquake.  But of course, that was to the West Coast.  Why not the New Madrid area?  I don't know the answers as to why they're moving the people where they're moving them.  All I know is that this is what they're doing.  All right, it says, it's almost as if they are working in unison.  As the slip continues in the Cascadia, there's more seismic activity on the New Madrid.  Now, To my famous source, if you happen to be listening to the broadcast yourself tonight, that is true.  They are working in unison.  I did find out from Pentagon sources there that that is something that it's all connected together.  Now, I got also this.  Nope, not that one.  Sorry.  Wow, I do not have it up.  Anyway, I just have to tell you from memory then, I was told there's a lot of rumbling going on.  And you can probably see that on the top left side of the screen there, rumbling and Stephen.  A lot of rumbling is going on and that what was happening is that everything is coming alive.  we are seeing shift movement cross movement even with I was told the Philippines Indonesia Japan of course the Cascadia.  and I was told of course already that the Cascadia is what's affecting the new Madrid fault line.  now as a result the information was being shared with me is that that new Madrid fault line or seismic activity on the West Coast, because everything is shifting at one time, they don't expect greater earthquake being placed in one area but it'll be many earthquakes that will kind of dissipate some of that size of what the earthquake is that they're anticipating.  but keep in mind I don't have any idea how strong that could be.  that I mean what if it's what if that dissipating ends up still being like eight point five or eight point oh or even a nine point something Whereas if it was just all in one area, it could be even a 10 or some other kind of record breaking type of earthquake.  I have no idea.  I know there's a lot of people concerned because John Moore, the map, he's always shown us what's going to happen.  I think that's still premature.  Some of the things that I've been told, that is coming.  I hate to tell you that it's coming, but we're still a couple of years out before that event takes place.  I do know that governments, at least the U.S.  government, there is major issues going on.  A lot of these guys are being put on standby.  You know, the resources in the Pentagon are running thin because of all the issues that are going on around the world there.  So, you know, I apologize.  I don't know all the answers there, but we're going to try to keep up with this for you the best we can.  Listen, those of you that want to continue on watching this broadcast, you'll probably catch the rest of this either on Patreon or one of our other channels there.  Let's see.  I'm not sure.  Oh, I'm just trying to think real quick.  Brand new tube, Israeli News Live.  We should be able to air over there as well.  But there are some things that I'm not going to play the rest of here on Israeli News Live because I am going to go into some subjects here.  that would be very, very risky for me on INL.  So we appreciate you watching here.  Be sure to subscribe to these other channels.  And look, I'm not trying to get you to go to Patreon.  Go to Brand New Tube if you want.  You can sign up with iConnectFX.com.  We load there as well.  I'll probably have more teachings on that side there than I do my news.  But I do put news there as well.  So it can be there too.  But... uh either brand new tube or israeli news live and you got to go to the link in the description because believe me people are always pirating our videos.  they post them even on brand new tube.  um and unfortunately people don't go and find us.  when you type in israeli news live you go to somebody else's channel.  it's not ours.  so take an Click on the link.  It'll take you there and subscribe to the right channel.  Patreon as well, Israeli News Live.  If you want to help support the broadcast, we appreciate it.  Jump on there.  I'm going to continue on the rest of you guys.  Let's go to the next page here, what we're going to be looking at. ",
