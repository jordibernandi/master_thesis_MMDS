            "text": "Alright.  And he's not done.  The Bible said in describing the Antichrist that he's there to conquer through peace.  And you talked about the revived Roman Empire, where he's going to gather the world together.  He's going to have the power to make everybody think that he is terrific.  But he pulls off a peace treaty with Israel and the enemies that we see around her right now, that nobody else has been able to do.  He's going to pull it off.  And that really starts the tribulation period ticking.  Talk about that for a moment, and then I want to get back to God's doing something at the same time.  What is God doing?  But talk about the fact of this peace treaty being signed. ",

            "text": "John, here's where we go out of the book of Revelation to an Old Testament reference, Daniel 9, verse 27.  In that verse it says, and He, that's referring to the Antichrist, will confirm a covenant.  That covenant's talking about the peace treaty that you've just mentioned.  And in that period of time there's going to be a temple, and He'll cause the sacrifice in the temple to stop.  He'll just have everything cease at that point in time, because ultimately ahead is the abomination of desolation.  Which is what?  The abomination of desolation is when actually the antichrist walks into the Holy of Holies at a temple at the midway point there of the tribulation period between the rapture and the return of Jesus Christ.  2 Thessalonians 2, 4 says he goes in and claims to be God.  That's blasphemy against Almighty God.  That's the abomination of desolation.  Now, returning to the peace agreement that he's going to confirm, and this is key, there are already three peace treaties on the table.  He's not going to sign a peace treaty.  The Bible never says, Antichrist will sign a peace treaty.  He says, I will confirm a peace treaty.  That word in Hebrew is gabar, G-A-B-A-R, which actually translated does mean confirm.  So you have the Camp David Accords, 1979, Jimmy Carter, Anwar Sadat and Menachem Begin.  Anwar Sadat, president of Egypt, Menachem Begin, prime minister of Israel.  They go to Camp David and they come up with the Camp David Accords, a peace treaty.  And then the second peace treaty would take place on September 13, 1993, when Bill Clinton would bring Yasser Arafat to the White House along with Yitzhak Rabin, who was the prime minister of Israel.  And they would sign then the Oslo Accords, a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinian people.  The next year, October 26, 1994, Bill Clinton comes back into the Middle East.  He brings along all of his constituency of leaders that help him to do what he does as president.  He invites King Hussein of Jordan to come into the Arava, which is the southern end of the Jordan Valley, right near Eilat and the Red Sea.  And then he brings Yitzhak Rabin, Prime Minister of Israel.  The three men.  They then signed the peace treaty between Israel and Jordan.  John, I had the privilege of being able to be there, just about as close as I am from here to you when these men signed this treaty. ",

            "text": "Well, here we have now then the three peace treaties, Camp David Accord, 1979, Oslo Accords, 1993, 1994, the peace treaty between Israel and Jordan.  And so going back now to the text, Daniel 9 and verse 27, it says that he, the antichrist, will confirm.  He doesn't sign, but he walks on the scene, he looks at the treaties, and he says, gentlemen, I can confirm this treaty.  And He confirms all three treaties who are not working today, they've never been normalized, and He confirms them.  And that does, as you mentioned, start the clock ticking on the seven-year tribulation period. ",
