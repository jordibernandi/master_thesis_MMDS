And if you look at what's gone on, and if you look at now all of this information that's being released, and from what I understand, that's only the beginning.  Some terrible things happened, and it should never be allowed to happen in our country again.  And you'll be seeing what's going on over the coming weeks.

One of the reporters stood up, asked him, Hey, man, you are accusing Barack Obama of committing a crime.  You're going to try to go after him?  And what are you going to try to go after him for?  Oh, well, you know.  It's, uh, it's, uh, it's, uh, it's all coming.  It's all coming out in the future.  You'll see.  You'll see.  Man, this is just Donald Trump's strat, right?  This is his strategy.  Man, I'm going to come up with something so outrageous and so bogus, I'm going to promise it to my base just to get them... Just to get them fired up.  And I'm just going to tell them, oh, man, we're about to drop it.  We're about to drop the documents.  The document dump is coming, everyone.  You guys just get ready for it.  This is the same thing he did with COVID-19.  Oh, there's evidence.  And we have documents that supports that the Chinese made this in a lab.  You'll see.  You'll see.  Just wait.  The documents are coming.  It's been weeks, Don.  No documents.  Same bullshit here.  Why would you sit and wait on the Obamagate documents if you had them?  It's been years, Don.  So this is just Don Juan pulling the same Don Juan nonsense, promising his base that he's got so much evidence to support his outrageous claims when he doesn't have anything. ",
