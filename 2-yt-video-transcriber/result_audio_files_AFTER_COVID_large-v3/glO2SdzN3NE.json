I suppose the closest thing I come to is deist, but I don't hold all of their beliefs.  And one thing that I have noticed watching, I've watched Atheist Experience a bunch, only just kind of found talk even maybe six months ago.  Welcome.  And I wanted to talk about some views that I have seen from certain atheist people a lot on the atheist experience.  Not so much on talk even, but that's because I've only been watching it for a little while.  Certain views regarding hell, specifically the Christian version of hell.  And I feel bad consistently referring to atheist experience here, but this is something that I mainly hear from Matt Dillahunty, Jeff D., and Russell.  And it's, you know, anytime I have heard any of them be told by a caller, you know, oh, you know, if you don't believe you're going to hell, they both become... furious at being told that.  and that's honestly something that confuses me because i do not believe in hell at all.  and the reason it confuses me is if you don't believe that something exists why would you be angry at someone being telling you you're going there like if someone tells me i'm going to hogwarts?  i'm not excited about that because it doesn't exist Yeah.

            "text": "Well, so I think there are two parts to that, man.  The first, I think you probably relate to more, and that is the, it doesn't believe, or it doesn't believe, I don't believe, so I'm not really scared of a thing that I don't believe, which is understandable.  um the other side of it is the the the judgment piece and i think that there's a fair number of people who will say hey you know what you're you're espousing these views and you're saying oh they come from your god but i don't believe in your god.  so they're coming from you and if you are telling me i'm going to hell then it's kind of putting a bit of onus on them and saying hey do you think that's a right thing?  do you think that is an okay thing?  and and and why am i worthy of eternal torment?  it's not so much that i'm angry or upset about the place itself as much as it is the just passively going.  oh yeah yeah no you're gonna go and and suffer for eternity.  um right and and there's just a lot of nuance to it because i think that there are a lot of believers who don't make that connection and so they will say you know hey you're gonna go to hell but maybe they haven't thought about it fully maybe they're not recognizing just how heinous of a thing that is.  and so i think that there are a lot of different tactics that people have to try and Make people think about that.  And sometimes anger is one way to do it.  Other times, maybe just talking about it like this is.  But I think it takes all approaches.  So I think the approach that they take is valid, but not because they're actually afraid of the, you know, the hell place as much as it is the judgment.  What do you think, Vee? ",

            "end_time": "00:04:07,260",
            "text": "Yeah, I think you're spot on.  Not only are they saying implicitly that I am interacting with you, but I am also making a judgment claim about you as a person and whether or not you deserve a happy ending.  no pun intended that's for secular sexuality but no and in addition to that they're also saying and the God that is going to put you there is somebody that I admire someone that I love someone I believe in someone you should believe in.  so it's a two part thing.  it's not just I believe this is your fate it's also I support the person who's going to inflict that upon you.  so again like Eric said there isn't a lot of the time, that viewpoint that is fully being expressed for the theist.  So the theist might not understand that that is what they are implicitly saying, because to them, it's just by rote, right?  They just have heard this their whole lives and are repeating it to you, often out of a place of actual concern, often out of a place of, hey, I want better for you than what I think you're going to get.  But to somebody who has really analyzed the background and the implications, it is difficult to see it in a way that is not insulting or demeaning. ",

            "text": "And I'll admit I hadn't considered the onus aspect of it, like Eric said.  You know, the idea that because I don't believe you know, in your God who is supposedly sending me to hell, then, you know, that means it's not God, but rather you, the person I'm talking to, who thinks I'm going to hell.  So I guess I hadn't quite made that connection. ",

I can still recall learning about that being probably six at the earliest memories and having scared thoughts of it as a young child.

Another reason that I know I will get upset if somebody lobs a you're going to hell at me, especially on air where other people can hear, is that we get callers all the time who have deconverted but still are plagued by this fear of hell and have been \u2013 abused in a sense into thinking that this was a thing that they deserved, a thing that they had to be afraid of and look forward to.  So it's not just an anger on my part.  How dare you think that about me?  A lot of it stems from concern for those people who I know are listening to me and watching this conversation.  and being concerned about how they're going to receive that and how to best facilitate their continued deconversion.
