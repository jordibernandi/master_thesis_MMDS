            "text": "Ladies and gentlemen, you know, I'm going to name this video Karen Charged, and I'm going to show you a series of different Karens.  And in some cases, we have some male Karens too, along with their women that have been recently charged.  So she's not alone.  She's definitely not alone when it comes down to prosecutors coming after her.  Now, many of you know Amy Cooper, who actually became an internet sensation when she was caught on camera in Central Park by Christian Cooper, unrelated, a bird watcher out in Central Park.  And she came through there with her dog that was not on a leash.  And that's how the entire incident happened.  Well, Manhattan D.A.  was not willing to let.  what Amy Cooper did.  She said she was going to call in an African-American was threatening her life, threatening her and her dog, which we know is a lie.  And in Central Park.  And again, I've been to Central Park.  You have to have your dog on a leash.  Those signs are all over the park.  I don't care what part of the park you go to.  you will see those signs.  Okay, so today, the prosecutor office in Manhattan, Cyrus Vance  Jr.,  said in a statement, our office will provide the public with additional information as the case proceeds.  So they have charged her with reporting a false incident in the third degree.  So not only did Amy lose her job behind this whole thing, but look like she's going to be dealing with paying for legal assistance because she's going to court over this mess.  You can best believe it.  So The prosecutor's office says at this time, I would like to encourage anyone who has been targeted of false reporting to contact our office.  So not just Amy Cooper, but they're telling anybody in Manhattan, if you've been out and about and somebody whipped out a cell phone and called the police and falsified a report, they are now encouraging New Yorkers to contact the prosecutor's office.  because they intend on going after these people.  And if you remember about two weeks ago, they passed legislation for this.  I knew they would because Cuomo was actually talking about this during one of his coronavirus press conferences.  He mentioned that this woman should be charged.  And I knew once the governor said it, they were gonna make that happen.  They were definitely going to make that happen.  So they're saying to people in Manhattan, all over New York and Manhattan, if you have experienced someone like Karen making calls on you, contact the prosecutor's office.  We strongly are committed to holding perpetrators of this conduct accountable.  Now, if they would just do this in all 50 states, So this is kind of good that Manhattan is doing this because now it will make other Karens that pop up on the scene a lot more reluctant to do these things, especially if they know there's going to be some consequences behind it.  And that's the reason why it's happening as we're seeing it.  There's never been any consequences for these women for 500 years.  This is why they are hell bent on starting these altercations, because every time you see the videos, they're starting the entire thing.  So good.  I'm glad this is happening to Amy Cooper.  You know, this is what she get.  All you had to do was put your dog on your leash, you know, on the leash and go on about your merry business.  But you complicated this entire thing.  So here you are.  Many of you remember this couple.  Now, I did a video on these two and an update within the same video.  And this woman bumped, if you remember, Jillian here, bumped into a 15-year-old Black girl.  And she only did that because she was armed.  And these two were out purposely looking for trouble.  They were.  They were out there looking for trouble on purpose.  So this is Julianne Wustenberg and her husband, Eric, have both been charged with felony assault.  And, you know, she's 32, he's 42.  And they pulled a gun out on a Black mother and her teenage daughters over an altercation over Julianne here, bumping into the girl and not saying anything.  So she was, like I said, you know, whenever you see them empowered like that out in public, they're packing heat.  So they were arrested.  Eric has since lost his job.  And behind this whole incident and boy, what a hell of a time to lose your job when a pandemic is going on and all businesses are not even open anymore.  to even hire you into another position.  So he's going to have a hell of a time on unemployment.  So ladies and gentlemen, it's a good thing that finally they are charging these people that are going out here looking for trouble.  You would think during the time of coronavirus, you would not want that kind of contact with anyone out in public, but these folks don't care.  They don't care.  Ladies and gentlemen, this woman that you're looking at, remember she was blocking a Black woman from leaving the parking lot of a Kroger supermarket in Michigan, Wayne County, Michigan.  Prosecutors have decided to charge 46-year-old Livonia woman at a grocery store harassment incident.  So her name is Paula Marie Guerin, 46 years old.  Now she looked beat up for 46, was charged in connection with intentionally blocking another female shopper's car.  So the shopper was not able to leave the grocery store parking lot.  And Livonia, so the prosecutors are charging her.  So on June 13th, around 4  p.m.,  Guerin was in a grocery store with her child located at 335 Block 8 Miles.  So 8 Mile Road in Livonia.  Okay.  So she had a verbal exchange with this woman, apparently in the store, and decided to go outside and finish this altercation with the woman by blocking her in and not allowing her to leave with her groceries.  So the officers did arrive, talked to both parties.  Guerin was charged with disturbing the peace.  So she was arraigned Monday morning, this past Monday, and given a $500 personal bond, which, you know, she can make that.  That's nothing.  You know, that's nothing.  But, you know, I'm glad they are coming back at Karen for these incidents.  And I think pretty much it's a wrap for them once it goes viral, you know.  It's pretty much a wrap.  All right.  Many of you might remember Anti-Mask Karen.  This is the woman that went into a Target and started destroying a display of masks, throwing the mask all over the floor, being all defiant in the store about having a face covering on.  Well, she ended up going on Instagram Live.  And when she did that, the police were actually there at her home when she went on Instagram Live.  And this is just a still shot of her.  So you can see what she looked like.  They still did not release this woman's name, but she was arrested on Instagram.  And that as far as what they are reporting, whether the store will move forward to press charges on her, they could.  We shall see.  But she was dealt with, at least at that moment.  So any of you that saw the video of her on Instagram with her camera filming the police who were wearing masks, Karen was still spewing all kinds of junk at them.  And defending her right to not, you know, to do what she did, which was not her right.  You do not have the right to go in a store and destroy property because you don't like what You know, it is.  Many of us walk in stores and there's quite a few items in that store you may not care for.  You may never purchase or you just straight up don't like.  That don't mean you have the right to walk over and start destroying anything that's in the store.  Right.  You just don't.  So, ladies and gentlemen.  They really do need to start enforcing this stuff more.  Many of you might remember this couple, ladies and gentlemen.  You know, it was just protesters walking past their home and they decided to come out and brandish weapons, which they were completely out of line.  People walking past your home is not illegal.  It's not illegal.  Nobody came onto your property to make any threats.  People really didn't start saying anything to them until they saw them standing there with weapons, which was completely uncalled for.  And they definitely went overboard.  Okay, so this is Mark McCloskey, 63, and his wife, Patricia.  They were seen, of course, on viral videos and photographed.  just standing there with, she was holding a handgun.  He was holding an AR-15 rifle.  And all of this because people were just simply protesting and walking past their homes.  They didn't even stop in front of their homes.  They kept it moving.  They were actually on their way to the mayor's home to protest.  And I still got to do a video on that one, y'all.  And that's all they were doing.  So these two definitely went overboard in this whole situation.  And they are now being charged for brandishing guns.  Okay.  And they did this to people that were unarmed and just simply protesting, walking past their home in order to get to the mayor's home.  That's all they were doing.  So, I mean, if they wanted to come outside just to make sure nothing happened to their property, I can see that.  But this, this just went way too far.  It really did.  It went way too far.  And I know why they came out like this, y'all.  It's because of the appearance of those protesters.  And we all know that.  So they called them Ken and Karen.  they could face charges for brandishing guns on their property.  So ladies and gentlemen, even if they feared something was going to happen to their property, there was still better ways of handling the situation than coming out with loaded weapons, by the way, on a crowd of people.  And when you watch the video, everybody was just walking.  Nobody stood still in front of their property and started protesting there.  That did not happen.  So, ladies and gentlemen, look like Karen may be paying a price now that she never had to pay for in the whole history of her existence in America.  But y'all, please tell me what you think.  This is long overdue.  Please leave your comment and subscribe.  Don't forget to hit on the notification bell and I'll see you on the next video.  Peace, family. ",
