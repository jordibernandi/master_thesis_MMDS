            "text": "Good rising, brethren.  This is Big Judah, coming to you guys from California.  Before I begin, in all praise, it's the Most High, Yehovah.  Acknowledgement to the Earthly Mother, who is wisdom, who is the Holy Spirit.  Acknowledgement to Yehovah Shai.  I pray that the Most High blesses this lesson this evening, gives more knowledge and understanding of the events of the past.  In order to understand the events that are currently happening, happen on the earth.  So we get a much better understanding of things that are soon to come on the earth.  As things are culminating and coming together, and the lies of the Gentiles and the wicked are being exposed, things or ideas and things about what we should be doing are coming to mind.  We know that the Most High is going to cleanse the land.  We know that the Most High is going to protect us as the death and destruction starts to manifest itself.  And I wanted to share a little bit of information here from this book right now, talking about the cleansing of America.  We're going to see a lot of death and destruction around us.  The Most High said he's going to remove the wicked.  This guy right here makes some pretty good points here in this part of the book.  Both God's law and a Zion society are in America's future.  Let's read that again.  Both God's law and a Zion society are in America's future.  What's amazing right now is this.  Last couple of days, talking to my brethren, talking to family members, because I watched a video by Brothers of Bach, and they were talking about how they had purchased some property in Georgia.  And that kind of got me thinking about purchasing some property in the Midwest.  We've all heard about how it's imperative for us to get off the coast.  And I haven't really had it in my heart to think about moving or getting a property for us as a, as a nation to be able to come together.  And, um, Be able to like to celebrate our feast days together.  Have like a central location.  Have some property for us to be able to come together.  You know, because we have to also kind of tarry until the Most High comes.  So that's just something that's been on my heart.  I'm going to continue to pray about it.  And I pray that the brethren who are now in this truth continue to pray about this as well.  Jews and Gentiles alike, because it talks about how, at the end, the Gentiles are going to come and want to actually help us, actually want to assist us.  And it's going to get to the point where we need to figure out what it is we want to do as a nation.  We know that standing pat wherever we're at right now is not necessarily going to be most advantageous.  So I've already been thinking about that yesterday and today.  And then all of a sudden, you know, I just happened to pick up this book, happened to kind of pick out these two couple of pages, and it really didn't click right now until I decided to read it right now for this video about both God's law and a Zion society are in America's future.  I haven't thought about exactly how this is going to go down.  I've just been praying about it.  And as I was praying today at six, the Most High said to me, he said, try me.  Because, you know, hey, this isn't something that, this is not my expertise.  This is a whole other thing that I have very little knowledge and understanding of.  One of my brothers actually, he has a lot of understanding about this.  Excuse me.  But it's just something that we need to think about as a nation.  We're getting to a point where we just can't be content with just talking about the truth, talking about us being restored.  We actually need to start thinking about actually making some actions.  So we have an opportunity to have a place to come together.  I know we're working towards 2024 and the eclipse is about to come over Makanda, over the Midwest.  I think maybe we need to pray about it.  Maybe we need to be centrally located.  Located in the Midwest.  Located close to where this X is going to appear.  We know that the Mulsai is going to provide all that we need.  And I know that we have a lot of people in the nation that have particular skill sets.  that will be actually great for us to work together and start that Zion society.  We all know that this is America's future.  We are going to come together like we were before.  We were torn apart by the wicked.  We were kind of talking about it and talking about actually going at it real slow, but I don't think we have that kind of time, family.  I don't think we have the time to take it slow.  And when those words from the Mosai said, try me.  When I was like, well, I don't know how we can do this.  I don't know how we can do this.  I don't know how we can get this.  I don't know where we could go.  And then the Mosai just said, try me.  So that's why I'm just throwing this out here this evening.  Because to see which people would be interested in this.  Which people would be interested in donating to this.  Which people would want to actually come.  I'm not talking about making a society right now.  We're talking about this versus building a foundation, getting some land, coming together, you know, for our feast days in the new year, coming together a few days like right now in the month right now.  It's here in September.  Maybe coming together in the summer.  I think we're going to have a very eventful fall and winter right now.  You know, we're all going through our atonement.  We've been praying to our father.  The wicked are praying to their father.  And I feel that we're going to see some very eventful things.  This is something that's kind of placed in my heart after listening to that video.  I shared it with a few brethren.  They seem to have the same mindset.  So that's why I wanted to share it and kind of throw it out there to the nation.  Let's read a little bit right here.  It says, although, as we have said, it may take some remarkable circumstances to bring it about, there is a point on the most highest timeline when America will fulfill a remarkable role.  Daniel saw it, and so did Moses.  Isaiah saw it, and so did Malachi.  Meanwhile, all of us have certain immediate tasks.  We should take every precaution as well as positive steps to stabilize our families.  We should practice frugality and sacrifice where necessary to get completely out of debt.  We should have an adequate storage supply of food, fuel, and warm clothes that will last at least a year.  We should carefully study God's law so we can explain its advantages when people are frightened and need hope and encouragement.  And I think we're in that point right now.  I mean, some of these guys, you know, some of the stuff he's talking about, you know, we're going to have to trust on the most high for what's going to be coming in the near future.  But explaining, you know, studying God's law so we can explain it, its advantages when people are frightened and need hope and encouragement.  I say, you know, right now you see a whole lot of people that are losing hope and are going to need encouragement.  But they're only going to be able to come if the most high calls them.  We should stay close to the author of God's law.  Read the scriptures every day.  What we know about reading, studying and reading other books as well.  Lastly, we should keep our eyes on the most highest timeline and never forget that Moses said, now that's the main thing, the most highest timeline.  Look and you got to know who the people are in order to follow the most highest timeline.  You've got to be able to look at who are the Most High's chosen people, and then once you can see that, read them.  Read what's happening to them, because that's the Most High's timeline.  It says, and it shall come to pass, when all these things are come upon thee, the Israelites, the blessing and the curse.  See, they're not looking at our curses.  They're looking, they're just stepping right over that.  They're ignoring us, how we've gone through our curses.  Everything is about the Israelites.  That's why he says right there, and it shall come to pass when all these things are come upon thee, the Israelites, 400 years.  Genesis 15, 13, the end of that, the end of the curses.  Now we're getting close to the time that the Israelites are going to be restored.  That's where we're at right now.  The restoration of the most highest people.  The blessing and the curse.  See, the whole world is not looking at the Israelites.  We were blessed before and we went through the curse.  Okay?  It says, which I have set before thee and thou shalt call them to mind among all the nations where the Lord thy power hath driven thee.  So all these blessings and curses are gonna come to the minds of all the nations.  So again, which I have the blessing and the curse, which I have set before thee, and thou shall call them to mind among all the nations.  We're going to remember ourselves.  We're going to remember who we are.  We're gonna remember the blessings that we had before, And as we come out of these curses and the people around us, the Gentiles, the ones that in most eyes awakened, they're going to see the truth as well.  And that's why I said, it talks about some of the Gentiles, you know, the most eyes are going to awaken, are going to want to help us.  They're going to be driven to help us.  I read about that and some of the other stories about the apostles when they were actually in other parts of the world, like Rome.  I want to say the gospel of Peter.  I'm going to have to find it and make a video on it.  But it was like he had a group of people that were all working together, the Hebrews.  And this woman who was supposedly a wicked woman came and brought like 50,000 gold pieces.  And the other people were like, you can't take that money.  This woman's a, you know, she's a whore.  She's this, she's that.  And then Peter was like, hey, I don't know anything about that.  I just know that the Most High wanted her to bring this to me and they were going to use it for the good of the nation.  That's going to happen again.  Israelites are going to help.  The other nations are going to help.  And like I said before, it's going to be a what?  both God's law and a Zion society are in America's future.  We know who we are.  We know that we're the most highest chosen.  And the most high is going to awaken all the nations to that very soon.  So like I said, right here, let's read that once again.  Which I have set before thee, And thou shalt call them to mind among all the nations, whither the Most High thy God hath driven thee.  And thou shalt return and obey the voice of the Most High, and do all his commandments which I command thee this day.  And the Most High thy God will make thee plenteous in every work of thine hand.  in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit of thy land, for good.  For the Most High will again rejoice over thee for good, as he rejoiced over thy fathers.  So now it makes sense to him when the Most High says, try me, because he is going to, if this is the will of the Most High, he will open up doors.  He will open up avenues for us to get whatever it is that we need, and he will prosper us.  See, the churches used to use all this prosperity gospel for them, but they were doing it for Satan.  They were doing it for the wicked demons.  When the Most High gets us ready to move and to acquire all the things that we need, we're going to have everything that we need and more.  And the Most High is going to bless us.  And he's going to raise us up.  And he's going to make us that beacon on the hill, that light to the world for all to see.  So this is just something that the Most High has put on my heart.  And I'm just sharing it out with the nation right now.  Do you guys have any comments or whatever else?  Throw them in the comment board.  You know, I said this isn't for everybody.  This is for the ones at the most highest moved to think about these kinds of things.  I've gotten plenty of people that have talked to me about doing things, getting together, working things out.  And it's just been something that hasn't really, you know, pricked my spirit.  But now it seems to be.  Thinking about getting something.  We'll talk about it more later.  But if it's something that interests you, if it's something you want to be a part of, if it's something that you want to support, I said, just put it in the comment board or shoot me an email.  TribeofJudah0 at gmail.com Because I said, I think that, well, we know the times that we're in.  I think that 2020, going forward here, the rest of the three months that we have left, so it's going to be very, a lot of momentous Events are in our future.  The true revealing of the Most High.  The true revealing of His people.  Seeing who He has now in His hands and the ones that He's going to allow to suffer.  Spirits moving people to do different things.  But I know we're going to have a lot more people who are going to be moved to support the truth.  we're going to have a lot more people that are going to be moved to support the Most High's chosen people.  Spirits are going to be moving to open up doors for us.  So if the Most High moves us to get some property, and first thing, we could just have a chance to come together after we get through the fall and the winter, and we have a chance to get together and fellowship with one another.  Because we're going to need that.  We're going to need to come together as a people.  If that's what we know what the land's going to be for at first, you know, that's what we'll do.  If it's for, if it gets to a point where the Mosai tells us we all need to go to this place to be together and we have to run away because things are going crazy where we're at, then that's what it'll be for also.  But it's going to be some land where we can go and be together as a people.  If that is just temporary for now, if as things get worse and worse, the Most High makes it that we have to stay there or get more land or whatever else for more people.  I mean, we know that this truth is growing like crazy.  We know that the Most High is going to bring us together as a people.  I know some other brethren are already doing this as well.  And it seems as if the Most High is blessing them to get land and do things.  That's a beautiful thing.  So if this is the most high moving me to do the same thing, you know, I have other brethren I can go and talk to that we can get things situated and we can go forward with this as well.  But as I get more information, I will share it with you guys.  But like I said, I don't think we have that much time.  I think we're going to have to start moving pretty quick if we're going to acquire something.  We're getting close to the election.  And Trump's already said that, you know, quite possibly he doesn't think he's not trying to do a peaceful transfer if he doesn't win.  If somebody cheated.  He's already trying to push a new person into the Supreme Court, which then maybe he can fight it that way.  So who knows what's going to happen in the next few months?  But we do know that, you know, quite possibly, you know, infections are going to increase if that's if that's a possibility, you know, with the weather and everything else.  Another surge, you know, I said, we just know that the most high is about to show out.  And us as a nation need to start to think about coming together and acquiring things, acquiring land, acquiring things together.  And then see how the Most High moves us.  Like I said, this is just a thought.  Putting it out there right now.  Leave some information, you know, in the comment board.  Tell me what you guys think.  But I've heard about, definitely for a long time, about getting off the coast.  Got a lot of brethren all over the country, all over the world.  So I think I'm possibly acquiring some land in the Midwest.  So we all have a place to kind of congregate to.  But we'll see.  We'll see where the Most High moves us, okay?  But I just wanted to share that out right now, and we'll see how this goes going forward.  All praise is to the Most High, Yehovah.  Acknowledgement to the Earthly Mother.  Who is Wisdom?  Who is Holy Spirit?  Acknowledgement to Yahushua.  Shalom.  Shalom. ",
