            "text": "Hello from Providence, Rhode Island to everyone in the Brown community, wherever this message finds you.  This is truly an unprecedented time.  The country and the world are experiencing an international health crisis that's affecting our communities and our families in deeply personal and sometimes devastating ways.  And this is happening in our jobs and our schools and the towns we call home.  We're all feeling the severe effects of this pandemic.  But even as this crisis has dispersed us, and even as we wrestle every day with unforeseen challenges, we are still a community.  We are still Brown, and we endure.  Brown has always been about its people.  What distinguishes us as a university isn't just our physical campus.  We're a community that discovers and learns.  We conduct research and teach classes.  We recruit students and faculty.  And we do all of the things that make this work possible.  Support services, technology, business operations, facilities, and so much more.  And we do this with purpose and caring and great joy.  So in these difficult times, it's important that we maintain our community by continuing to do all of the things that bring us together.  We reject the notion that being in isolation means being isolated.  We hold the lectures and seminars and forums that bring the Brown community together with scholars from around the world to debate critical issues.  We hold lunches and learns and wellness events and professional development trainings that enrich us personally and in our everyday work.  And we continue to host the conferences and meetings that keep us engaged with others in our fields to share best practices, as well as opportunities for innovation and growth.  We should still have arts events that inspire and amaze.  We should host performances and virtual exhibitions that bring the visual and performing arts into our homes or wherever else we may be.  And we should all be there.  Technology allows us to show up, not just as audience members, but as engaged participants.  While we maintain our community virtually, we're also planning for the time when we can be together again.  And right now, we're hoping that will be in the fall.  Due to the continued spread of COVID-19, we've made the difficult decision that commencement and reunion cannot take place this spring or summer, but planning is already underway for hosting it later.  So our students will be awarded their degrees at the end of the semester, just to allow them time to move forward with post-graduation plans.  But we will have commencement and reunion.  The Van Wickle Gates will swing open while alumni and parents and friends celebrate our graduates.  So until then, let's remain connected and engage with each other.  The strength and resilience of Brown for more than 255 years is its people.  We are Brown no matter where we are.  So thank you. ",
