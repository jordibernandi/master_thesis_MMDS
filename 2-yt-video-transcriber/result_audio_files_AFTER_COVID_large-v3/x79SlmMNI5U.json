This also happens if you shine it a long way away.  If I shine it over in this garage door over there, if you see on this video here, you can see a dot moving around.  Now, the dot is mirrored around the center of the image just because it's the way it reflects internally.  It's a reflection of some kind of plane surface inside.  It's a very common type of reflection, and you often see it next to the sun, and people mistake it for some kind of UFO next to the sun.  You see it above, say, streetlights, and people think it's a UFO up in the sky.  You have a streetlight, say, down the bottom, and then you have the UFO up in the sky.  Sometimes you get a whole bunch of them up in the sky.  You get these lights down the bottom and a bunch of lights up top.  So anybody who's into investigating UFOs or weird photos should be familiar with this type of reflection.  You get a very bright light and you get a dim dot that is pretty much opposite the middle of the image and will mirror the motions of the main dot.  And the fact that they didn't notice this was what was happening in this History Channel show on the Skinwalker.  kind of shows that they don't really know what they're talking about.  How is it doing that? ",
