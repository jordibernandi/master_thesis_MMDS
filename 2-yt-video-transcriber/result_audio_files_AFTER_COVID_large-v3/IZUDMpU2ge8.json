            "text": "So, Blacksit family, Blacksit family, Blacksit family, how are you today?  How are you all over the world?  Because the Blacksit family has expanded.  Now, this is a very different video, and I'm actually doing this because my son asked me to calf-raise.  And he's actually doing the filming at the moment.  So he's actually holding the camera and I have the mic right here.  So I hope you can hear me.  Basically, he's asked me to do a video based on something that we were watching today.  Now, today I was watching Wodamaya.  As you know, we love to watch Wodamaya.  And Wodamaya, quite interestingly, was discussing the issue about testing and vaccines.  Now, when I saw the video and I could see the passion in Wodamaya and I have got nothing but love for Wodamaya.  And when I could see that, you know, he's obviously very hot on this topic, very hot on this issue.  And he shared about the facts of the numbers.  worldwide of the people with coronavirus and he also shared about the few cases that there are actually on the continent of Africa.  and then for any vaccines and I hear today I was out and about also and I was told that oh Juliet be careful with the masks.  so You know, you can buy, like, I bought this in a local supermarket.  It's an antibacterial surface cleaner and it kills bacteria.  Just spray it and put it out in the sun or soak it in salt as well.  And then, you know, you can make sure that the mask is clean and clear rather than not use one at all.  So that's why I'm saying that.  Another thing, the reason why I'm raising this, you have to keep the camera very still, Kath, so put your elbows, where's your elbows there?  Okay.  So bear with me and Kath, because this is our first program where Kath is making it with me.  Kath is just nine years old. ",

            "text": "so um you know i'm totally against.  i've got a nine-year-old and that's the reason why it's important that he's making this video with me.  i've got a nine-year-old child and i don't want my nine-year-old child to be vaccinated um especially in an experimental vaccine that we don't know what the health implications are.  and um you know i've seen that an emergency bill there are all these coronavirus emergency bills which are being passed into law in the UK as well as in different states in America.  And I'm imploring everybody, please look at these bills and also look at the implications of the powers that are being authorised through these bills.  It's very important that we know what our rights are and that this legislation isn't being rushed through.  there should be a way in which you can revoke or reverse some of these laws, particularly because if it's being passed into law and you haven't had a say on it, you don't even know anything about it, and it could have long and far reaching implications for you.  For example, if there was something in, for example, that was put into law, this is hypothetically speaking, that, for example, did not permit you to travel without having a vaccine, for example, in much the same way as they have done with yellow fever, for example.  Although yellow fever is not prevalent as it used to be, and some people might say it's down to the vaccine, I personally have never taken it and have travelled extensively around the world.  It's not that I'm against anyone taking or not taking it, I'm only sharing my own personal experience.  What I'm saying is that if they, for example, enforce that you have to take a COVID-19 or coronavirus 19 vaccine, as you know, GlaxoKline have obtained, I think, the patent on the vaccine.  I'm going to double check if that's fact.  But when I Googled it and I Googled into the patent, which was registered in America by various people, which you can also do, then you can also see where GlaxoKline also had applied for it, but just check the year.  Just check the year because I think it was 2014.  But I could be wrong.  But that's what I recall reading.  And my memory is not perfect science at all times.  But one of the things that I do want to emphasize about us as Africans, that I believe that this is a time for us to come together as Africans.  And they look just like us.  In fact, I was infuriated about a young lady called Kim, a beautiful black mum.  She was just 36 years old.  I was reading about her case in a newspaper from London who perished and passed and transitioned from coronavirus.  So this lady died because she was not a priority.  So I say, make yourself a priority.  Now, I put out certain information on the community page.  So if you're not familiar with that, if you slide across the top where it says videos, playlists, go to community and you see that I post there.  Now, I have posted there a number of things.  You know, what Dinah said when he went live in search for Hugh Uru on his channel and also Woda Mai on his channel.  You know, there are so many vloggers now who are out there and we've all got a very similar story to tell.  So I hope you're all listening and watching us all.  I just want to send my love to all of the vloggers out there, all of our African brothers and sisters out there vlogging and sharing the truth about what's happening, African Diaspora News with Phil Scott.  There are so many other people out there that are all vlogging.  So I just really want to just, you know, really reinforce what they're saying about us keeping safe, as black people are making ourselves a priority.  And also on the community page, I also put down some medication that you can actually, you know, insist on getting.  that will help you to overcome it.  So, you know, I want to do a coronavirus free show.  So I think I'm going to do like something really different to get our minds out of this mindset.  Because like today we had like a soul train in the house.  It was fantastic.  We were playing Like music from the 70s, 80s, 90s, dancing throughout the house.  We were having such a good time.  I was getting down, getting down, getting down, getting down.  And so, yeah, I just, you know, I want to kind of lighten up a little bit.  Lighten up a little bit.  Let's do this, you know.  Life is still to be lived.  So, you know, I just want to say I don't want no experimental vaccines coming to our clothes.  We don't want any old used clothes from China or from any victims or nothing.  You can keep them.  Yeah.  We don't need them.  Yeah.  We are in Africa and we are happy and we are safe and we want it to stay that way.  So anything that you've got that's infected, keep it away.  Keep it out of Africa.  If you're infected, stay out of Africa.  And if you're in Africa, stay safe.  We love our African family.  Remember one Africa, one nation, one community.  That's what we are, yeah?  One love, one destiny, one future.  So Blacksit family, just like to say thanks a lot.  Thank you to my gorgeous Kath.  Kath.  He's been filming this.  He wanted me to talk about the vaccines.  Obviously, he's a bit concerned because we were just watching Wodamaya.  So Wodamaya, thanks for putting it out there.  Thanks for sharing the information.  Thanks for caring about our community.  And Wodamaya, thank you for starting us on this journey.  And Kath Ray, I hear you science, you go ahead.  Say what you have to say. ",
