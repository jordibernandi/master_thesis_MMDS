And they need to enforce these restrictions.  For those folks who call themselves patriots, and they talk about freedom, and they talk about personal responsibility, and self-reliance.  Where are these people when it comes to the worst pandemic this nation has ever seen?  Where are they?  100 years ago, 102 years ago, there were a federal campaign with posters talking about it's patriotic to wear masks.  These were not liberals.  Where is that patriotism?  When you're talking about patriotism is connected to nationalism, right?  So if you believe in your nation, then you probably don't want to be supportive of the greatest villain, I mean, other than fascism, you know, to the actual strength and health of this country, which is this pandemic.  And when we talk about 9-11, this... it eclipses 9-11, right?  And yet there's no connection to people's political ideology with regard to doing what's best for your own country, not for your party, not for your ethnic group, not for whomever.  And it's disingenuous.  It is disgusting.  And it is the nature of the problem we face today because they are vaccinated from truth or enlightenment or self-reflection and we gotta deal with it.  And I guess the last point I wanna make is Biden's, what appears to be Biden's approach to like, you know, bringing people together is the absolute wrong way to go about this.  It is the absolute, we, It's not about coming to the middle about people who don't believe in science and those of us who do.  That's absurd.  We have to, we can't embrace civility until we embrace truth and justice.  And we can't do that if folks aren't willing to meet us halfway.  And they're not because they are set in their ways.  And this is pre-Trump, right?  This is Tea Party stuff, 2010.  And the Tea Party was informed by things leading up to 2010.  So this is just the genealogy of batshit crazy. ",

I am really surprised, even if it comes from private organizations, health organizations, world health organizations about, I'm just really surprised like there's very little effort other than maybe like a Hollywood star putting on a mask and like doing an Instagram video, effort to just inform folks about their personal response, just what RepRab said.  And then with that being said, like, how does the Biden administration undo this toxicity, this brainwashing that is really pulling our society down right now?  I mean, our global society, because the U.S.  has an impact on the world, folks, travel places, et cetera, and just every community in this country is equal.  even on the Democratic side.  I mean, how many lawmakers this week that are Democrats are out there having dinner and taking trips to Acapulco or wherever it was that they went right after they say that the mayor of Austin said that he was going to be shutting down Austin.  Then he takes a trip to Cancun or Mexico, wherever it was. ",

            "text": "No, no, that's the point.  You put your finger right on it.  And I want to expand on what Rab said in a way, which is that we have plenty of nationalism in the country, but we don't have a patriotic effort like we did in the end of world wars or whatever, because nationalism plus faith equals patriotism.  That's the missing ingredient.  And people have absolutely no faith in their government institutions on either side.  Let's not forget that the Trump mandate was not to succeed in anything.  It was just to prove them wrong.  prove all the jerks who ever told you that they were smarter than you about something wrong.  And obviously he works hard at that every day.  So I do think that, yeah, there needs to be more bipartisan ownership of this, but it doesn't matter.  Biden just needs to make sure that checks go out because that is the only measurable way.  He is actually writing checks of faith to people.  He will be restoring people's faith that this government is worth supporting, that they can believe that it will do something.  Because that's the difference between now and 1945 and 1965 and 1985 and 2005, right?  It doesn't matter.  that there is just a steady decline in the trust of any of these institutions.  And so from a messaging standpoint, the only person who I've seen sort of do this was when Trump insisted on putting his name on the check.  Because you take this fellow in Michigan, and the last time he saw some money, it was a check signed by Donald Trump.  So if Biden wants to counteract that, just do some math.  Make a real check that actually counts for something, and put your name on it. ",
