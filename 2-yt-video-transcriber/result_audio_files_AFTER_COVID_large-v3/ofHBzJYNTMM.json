I feel like I always learn a new label that you use for yourself every time you call in.  But I agree with you in the sense that even you can still use all those labels for yourself and still relate to Satanism and still kind of tack that on.  And there's no incongruity there.  I think the religions that you and I probably grew up with would say, no, you have to, you're a Christian first.  before anything else.  Like, that's your identity.  That is who you are.  And all this other stuff is of the world.  You can't do that.  I think as we're talking about Satanism here, it's a little bit more flexible in how you kind of use that in conjunction.  Yeah. ",

You know, you mentioned, I don't know about the seven, whatever, but if you go to churchofsatan.com, you'll see that the fundamentals are there, you know, the satanic sins, the statements, rules of the earth.  Like I said, there are all these groups that pop up all the time and they try to take things of Satanism and kind of reapply it to something that's more fitting to like a kind of mainstream society because they have their own kind of goals that they want to achieve.  So you want to just stick to the source, I think, and see if that's a good reflection of who you are. ",

And to me, that is, isn't that exactly what Jesus is attributed to saying?  You know, he's The Sermon on the Mount and everything that is attributed to Jesus in the Gospels is exactly the very first fundamental tendon of the Satanic Temple.  And when I look at all seven of them, I'm thinking, oh my God, this is completely humanistic information.  viewpoint that actually points toward how to live life peacefully.  And it's amazing to me that the Christian church thinks that the satanic temple or the satanic worshippers or whatever are evil.  When you look at them, when you look at these seven basic tenets, and it is all humanism from one to seven right down the line right. ",

            "text": "and and you actually uh you bring up a really good point actually.  um because you mentioned that that was the attendance of the satanic temple which is one of those groups that kind of take uh some of the trappings of satanism and they uh make it into something else.  and you actually are absolutely right that that first uh that first point of theirs is a great reflection of Christianity, right?  So I think that's what they did.  was they took the trappings of Satanism, the symbols, some of the atheistic aspects of it, but they really kind of reapplied it to kind of a more like a secular form of Christianity because that sells, I mean, and they've got a very, they've got a political agenda.  They've got their activism that they're involved in.  And so that requires, hitting a kind of mass audience and getting a lot of people to agree with you, a lot of people who are herd-minded, who are attracted to maybe Christian ideology or Christian philosophy, but don't like the whole kind of Jesus thing, but they're all for the teachings of Jesus.  So they'll be attracted to something like what you pointed out.  But that has nothing to do with the Church of Satan or the way Satanism has been defined since the founding of the organization.  So it's actually the polar opposite, I would say.  And you demonstrate that really well with that first point.  That is actually much more akin to Christianity or kind of Buddhism, but a secularized form of that than anything satanic.  But hey, if that works for you, that's great.  I mean... ",

If I want to smoke, I want to fucking have a cigarette, and I'm going to smoke.  It's my body, and if I'm not blowing my \u2013 cigarette into your face then it should be my my thing.  i should be okay.  you should be okay with me wanting to smoke my cigarette and and because my body is one that you cannot touch Right, yes.

            "text": "Again, that's not part of how I define Satanism or Satanism the way I see it.  It's not actually, again, it's not, I wouldn't say that has anything much to do with Satanism per se.  I think that was actually created in order to fulfill a political agendas.  That group is involved in several activist political campaigns.  So they actually have changed their agenda.  that it, It depends on the political aim at the time.  Over the years, they've kind of shifted certain things here and there.  They used to think that they actually believed in an actual devil and they worshipped a literal devil because that served a political goal.  There was a political requirement for... kind of theistic worldview.  But then when they realized they didn't need that anymore for their political agenda, they switched it over to something atheistic because that kind of, that pivot really helped achieve inroads in the atheist community and the humanist community.  So they kind of rearranged some of their statements and things like that to kind of fit that.  And then when they started other campaigns, they added certain things to their agenda that, you know, to their religion.  that kind of helped, make inroads on on that campaign.  but anyway my again if that works for you if that that stuff is is what you're into.  um you know good luck to you.  i'm not trying to change anyone's mind really but i'm just going to continue uh representing satanism uh you know as it was founded and as it was established and i think that i think it will continue to uh attract certain rare individuals as opposed to having to kind of wipe yourself to achieve a mass audience.

I hear so much.  So thanks again, Tim.  And here we go.  Okay, so we got one more call.  here I want to get to before we kind of take \u2013 kind of wrap up the show in a bit.  But I did have a question I wanted to ask you because you did talk about secular humanism again.  And it's going through my mind because that is a label I've used for myself, and I've never questioned it before.  Not quite in the same way that you have as what maybe could be wrong with that label, or at least where disagreements could be with Satanism.  Do you think it's possible to be a secular humanist and a Satanist at the same time?  Or do you think that those two philosophies just have no real crossroads? ",

And I know some people, some Satanists who lean secular humanists or are influenced by secular humanist writers and thinkers, and they might even consider themselves Satanists and secular humanists.  I mean, it really depends on how misanthropic and pessimistic you are.  And I have my days.  I have days where I'm a little more optimistic about things and I have a more cheery outlook on humanity and other days, not so much.  But I think it also depends on your definition of secular humanism.  I know that's a whole separate kind of conversation.  There are different groups that define it in different ways with different priorities.  But the big takeaway, I think, is recognizing man as an animal, but not a kind of... not superior to any other animal, I think, is how I would say it varies from secular humanism.  But I know secular humanists that wouldn't make that a big part of their world view, of their philosophy.  They wouldn't even consider that to be a thing.  They're just mostly concerned with having a scientific worldview and a scientific framing of morality and things like that.  which in that sense, it would have that overlap with Satanism in some ways.
