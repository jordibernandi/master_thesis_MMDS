            "text": "You got this camera like a weapon.  I'm giving you a directive to please give me six feet.  I was here first.  I was here first.  Okay.  Can you give me your name?  What is your name?  He wants to know your cell phone number.  My cell phone number?  I'm not going to give you my cell phone number.  Social distance.  Six feet.  Stop encroaching on my six feet.  Go back to where you came from.  Go back to where you came from.  Go back to where you came from.  That's it.  We got some activity here.  We're about to meet James Madison.  Some looky-loos.  Look like sheriff's detectives.  All right.  They're bugging out.  That's good.  James.  What's up?  No, no.  Yeah.  Eyes on the state.  Look at this guy.  James Madison.  That's a cool shirt.  Thank you, man.  I love food platters.  Me too.  Eyes on the state there.  How you doing?  I'm good.  How are you doing?  Not too bad.  I think Gabe Grohl's winning.  That's right there.  The TV, which is down, I think, over there, right across there.  I'm professional.  And everybody watching.  That is.  This is the rear entrance.  Yeah.  Employee entrance.  Yeah, this is a historic building.  Looks like they got the original doors on there.  I just recognized the Concrete Public flag.  I'm like, wait a minute.  And then it says Key West Resort.  That makes sense.  I love flags.  That's one of my things.  I love flags the way they're supposed to be.  It's like country sticks over here and then beachy over there.  It's pretty neat.  I don't even hear any airplanes picking up.  Four by four.  It is Lake Town.  They have some sticks and stuff like that.  Yeah.  We were literally walking.  We were literally walking.  We weren't standing.  No, we did not.  No, we didn't.  I did not stop.  We have it all on video.  This is what we do.  We have a fantastic life.  You stopped and came out looking for trouble when there was none.  Don't let people rent space in your head.  Turn around, dude.  There you go.  Stop looking for trouble.  Yeah, peace and love, right?  Fucking hypocrite.  Bitch.  There's no videotape anymore.  It's 2020, idiot.  Right.  Your mother's driving you around.  You get a life.  Okay, right.  She looked like... No.  Fucking create a world travel.  Create a world travel.  Get a life.  Create a world travel.  You're going to be famous now.  No, you're not excused.  Yep.  None of your business.  I suggest you tell your son to get back in the car.  oh my god I've never heard that one before.  I've never heard that one before.  you got this camera like a weapon.  you're holding it in my face like a weapon.  you got this camera like a weapon.  yeah No, I mean, the hand signals when we're walking through, it's like, wow.  Yeah, just be patient.  You have to yield to pedestrians.  Remember that.  No, you didn't.  You were saying, come on, hurry it up.  And I was walking.  I never stopped.  I never stopped.  I kept on walking.  And I was like, what are you doing?  Relax.  Relax.  Right.  Now you wait.  You wait your turn.  You wait your turn.  Right.  And then he came out asking for trouble.  Why don't you tell him, oh, you're wrong, honey.  I'm going to tell your dad that you're misbehaving.  Isn't that scaring you with his mask?  We used to be the home of the brave.  Why are you guys so scared?  I'm not.  Then, go on with your business.  So, get off.  Social distance.  Six feet.  Stop encroaching on my six feet.  Dude, go back to where you came from.  Was that a racist comment?  No.  Are you a racist at this company?  Racist of you, yes.  Yeah, okay.  That's on record.  Nobody wants to hear your version.  Watch your step.  You're encroaching on my six feet.  Stay back.  We're with We the People of the United States.  We the People.  I'm with him.  What website?  Bolt Action News Group.  You're going to be famous.  What website?  Bolt Action News Group.  You're going to be famous.  Bolt Action?  Bolt Action News Group.  Bolt?  Yeah.  Bolt Action.  On YouTube?  Look it up.  Bolt Action.  That's right.  We have a misunderstanding with you with hand signals.  Yeah.  And then the man in the car.  Yeah.  We assert our rights.  That's what I'm trying to tell you.  And we assert our rights.  We don't let anybody try to trample us.  We don't like bullies.  You're the bully to me, though.  No, you were saying hurry it up.  You were bullying me.  I was standing.  I stopped you.  I don't know who bit your arm, if it was your son or what, but you need to report that.  That's domestic violence.  You have to yield to pedestrians.  I did.  Right, and why did he come out?  Because you guys looked like you were not moving and you were standing.  How is it putting one foot in front of the other and walking is not moving?  What do you mean?  I never stopped.  I never stopped.  I never stopped walking.  I kept walking the whole time.  No, you didn't.  We had a misunderstanding.  We had a misunderstanding.  And then the guy in the car decided to get worse.  Exactly.  Well, actually... Then you said go back to where you came from, right?  Yes, please go back to where you came from.  Wow, what a racist.  Where are you from?  You're going to be so famous.  Because why?  We're both the same skin color.  There's no racism to it.  Then why did you just say go back to where you came from?  Because this is my county.  We're very quiet.  We're very polite.  He kind of was an asshole.  You were kind of an asshole.  What country do you think this is?  What country do you think this is?  I'm a Floridian.  In the country of what?  The United States of America, right?  We have a right to walk wherever the f*** we want in this country without somebody telling us to get out of here.  You don't have any right to tell me to get out of here.  You don't have any right.  I do.  I do.  Yes, I do.  No!  Then I have a right to do whatever I want to.  That's the whole fucking mentality.  You have a right to take it up another octave, too.  Yeah, you're right.  Get out of here.  Scram.  I live here.  I work here.  Beat it, then.  Go work.  Are you essential?  Steady.  Watch your step.  Oh, gosh.  That's going to be a great thumbnail.  Go back to where you came from.  Oh, boy.  You hear that?  She's still going in there.  Wow, what a snowflake.  Oh, it's creative world travel.  Oh, and she's calling the cops now.  Now I have to record it so you don't make a false police report.  That's a crime.  Public sidewalk.  Should I run like that?  Are you doing Spanish?  Voy a hablar en espa\u00f1ol solamente.  I got a call from somebody saying that they almost ran us over and then aggressively come at us.  I didn't hear that part, so I didn't know.  The only thing that I was told is somebody was recording somebody else.  \u00bfQui\u00e9n te dijo eso?  \u00bfQui\u00e9n te dijo eso?  \u00bfQui\u00e9n fue que te llam\u00f3?  This is a speaker.  His?  Yeah.  Okay, from what?  \u00bfCaminando?  From what?  Does this guy speak Spanish?  I don't know.  No, I don't speak Spanish.  \u00bfQui\u00e9n fue que te llam\u00f3?  Ask him who called him.  Who called you guys?  I'm not sure.  Okay.  But somebody called and said that somebody was recording them, asking who they were.  Are you recording right now?  No, I'm not.  Usually the phone's sticking out like that.  You ought to.  No, it's fine.  No recording.  That's good.  Transparency.  So, obviously, if you guys aren't doing anything wrong, then it is what it is.  So if you're recording on a public sidewalk, that's all you're doing.  You're perfectly allowed to do that.  What is your name and number?  He wants to see if we can go ride a lot in your car.  Not right now.  You'll have to call and schedule one.  I don't know if they let civilians do that.  I think that the policy is only people that are law enforcement or somebody that's in the academy.  What is your name?  He wants to know your cell phone.  My cell phone number?  I'm not going to give you my cell phone number.  Trying to get his name and badge number.  Yeah, I got it back.  Detective O'Shea with Tavares Police Department.  My badge number is Tavares 47.  Detective.  I thought you said Esposo, his wife.  No, I'm kidding.  Detective.  I don't understand you.  Detective?  Detective.  I don't know what that means.  Detective.  Yep, yep.  Detective.  So... You guys are filming on a sidewalk.  Now, what happened with the car on the setting, you guys?  I don't answer any questions.  Okay, that's fine.  Well, do you need anything from me?  No, sir.  Do you want to make a report?  No.  All right, cool.  What's up, man?  Hey, what's your name and number?  Uh, don't know.  He says you have a nice beard, you're similar.  Oh, appreciate it.  Six feet, please.  Six feet, Corporal.  If you don't want to do anything with the vehicle almost hitting you... Please stay six feet.  We're going to get out of your way.  I'm worried about COVID, Corporal.  I really mean it.  I'm giving you a directive to please give me six feet.  I was here first.  I was here first.  Okay.  Can you give me your name and badge number, Corporal?  Six feet, detective.  Six feet.  I just literally just got it now.  All right.  Y'all have a good day.  He's laughing profusely, breathing air in my direction, even though I told him to stay six feet away.  Total disregard for government orders.  You guys don't wear masks?  You're not wearing masks right now?  No.  No mask.  I see a mask right there.  But hang on.  Hang on.  You got any hand sanitizer?  I do.  Can I have some, please?  If you would like some, sir.  I would.  That's kind of my thing.  Getting hand sanitizer?  Yeah.  Put your hands out.  Thanks.  Yes, sir.  Honor your oath.  Always.  Right on.  You prior service?  No, sir.  Okay.  I just saw the tactical boots.  Oh, these are just shoes.  They're just Operator AF, though, right?  No, they're comfortable.  You guys have a Spanish speaker on the force?  I think that we actually just hired one.  Yeah?  I believe he speaks Spanish.  I was just wondering if you were ever going to call him out.  I'm sorry.  No.  Okay.  And what do you guys have, like about 10 officers on the force?  No, I think we have 28.  28?  I believe so.  We'll be there in a minute.  All right, y'all have a good night. ",
