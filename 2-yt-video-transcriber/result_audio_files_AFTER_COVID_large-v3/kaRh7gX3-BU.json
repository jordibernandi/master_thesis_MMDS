            "text": "Content warning.  This video contains content.  There's going to be a lot of discussion about transphobia, and that could be upsetting to some viewers.  Liberals use the term class reductionism wrong.  That shouldn't surprise you.  Liberals use every term wrong.  We shouldn't let liberals learn new words.  They'll just use them badly.  Liberals will use the term class reductionism to just mean, like, someone who talks about class, and that's bullshit, and that's not what it is.  When I use the term class reductionist, I'm not necessarily calling anyone a bigot.  I'm not saying you're a bad person or a bad leftist, necessarily.  I think it's a thing that anyone can just do.  sometimes, myself included, and it's a problem.  You take a variety of factors and reduce it down to simply class.  And sometimes you gotta do that.  Sometimes it's a useful shorthand.  but it may have the unintended or in some cases very much intended side effect of erasing or making apologetics for someone else's oppression.  The fact that a small handful of rich ghouls owns most of the money and will all die of starvation and exposure if we don't get some of it even though we're producing more than we need and throwing away almost half of everything at a time when that overproduction is poised to make our planet uninhabitable just so that the already unfathomably rich ghouls can have a computer readout that says that their wealth increased by 0.0001% and the only way that you can get the means of your survival is by throwing yourself into perpetual and worsening exploitation forever?  That's a big problem.  And it's a problem that's inextricably tied to class and cannot meaningfully be divorced from it.  It's a problem that affects all of us.  Literally everyone that's watching this video.  All of us need to worry about making a living and surviving the forthcoming end of the world.  While the aforementioned handful of rich ghouls don't.  They're not gonna watch this video.  I can say whatever I want about them.  They have more fun shit to do.  They have cocaine fountains.  They have champagne enemas.  I don't know what rich people do all day.  Golf?  Is it golf?  But here's the rub.  While we share that in common and should work together at dismantling that problem, many people also face other problems based on some sort of marginalized identity that compounds their experience of class.  Me and a black dude might be equally exploited working at a Burger King together, but I'm more likely to get the job and be exploited in the first place and less likely to be fired for bullshit reasons once there.  I'm more likely to be promoted to management at that Burger King than a co-worker who's a woman.  And while I'd still find the work physically taxing, I'd find it a lot less taxing than someone who's disabled.  If our project as leftists is to liberate the working class, we gotta understand these complications and work to fix them.  These facts do not distract from class analysis, because these facts are class analysis.  Rich bourgeois parasites don't work at Burger King.  They have more fun shit to do than that.  And even if they had to work at a fast food place, like, you wouldn't work at Burger King, you'd work at, like, Five Guys, but probably you'd want to spend your time at the cocaine fountain rather than... at the shitty fast food job.  All of this is pretty 101 shit, right?  Like nothing I'm saying here is all that controversial, but there's a reason I feel I have to reiterate this type of stuff over and over.  It's because of how perniciously shitty analysis can use the pretense of class to dismiss the concerns of marginalized people.  Case in point. ",

Now, as a Marxist, we have to uphold the idea that, or the reality, that material reality is real and is the basis of our ideas.  Life teaches us that materialism is true.  Materialism can be tested by science, by living.  Idealism... you know, is a human construct.  It's what makes gods, okay?  Transgender ideology is pure idealism.  It says, if I feel something, it's true.  We've all got our own reality.  We've all got our own way of... Now, of course, we all have our own feelings.  Yes, can't dispute that.

            "text": "Very few people dispute that there are differences in general between the sexes, but anyone who is credible would dispute that it maps neatly onto the binary categories of male and female because, you know, intersex people exist.  Also, the entire concept of biological sex is not really that simple.  It's kind of pseudoscientific to pretend it is, and you can learn more about that later in the Eyeball Zone.  That biological differences exist between most men and most women is not something the average trans person would dispute.  So pinning the majority of her argument on this point dodges the central issue that gender, the way we perform masculinity or femininity, is very much socially constructed and not immutable laws of nature.  Women don't come out of the womb with long hair wearing dresses.  Men don't come out of the womb with full beards and a wood chopping axe.  The words he and she were not discovered in a laboratory.  They were sounds we applied to people.  And yes, some aspects of gender are indeed stereotypical.  However, since these expectations are placed on people, if they fail to perform these stereotypes, people are deemed to be insufficiently masculine or feminine.  If a trans man continues to wear makeup after transition, for example, dickhead weirdos like Ms.  Brar would use that as evidence that they're faking it.  Trans people do not believe that they have somehow miraculously developed new chromosomes, that their belief manifests in changing their biology.  They believe that the gendered category they have been placed in is not the one that they would prefer.  And since gendered expectations are arbitrary, a fact Ms.  Brar went ahead and conceded when she started talking about gendered stereotypes, that's pretty reasonable, actually.  We can't use material analysis to determine how someone feels in their brain, but we can use it to determine what happens when that isn't respected, and it turns out the answer is a whole lot of suicide.  So let's not forget that that's what Jodi Brar is advocating for here.  And just... let's... and just... set aside the trans issue for a moment and just... look at how this is kind of garbage philosophically.  First of all, to divide each side of an issue into materialist and idealist and then suggest that the materialist side is always correct and the idealist side is always wrong is not exactly dialectical thinking, especially when the materialist side just so happens to be whatever you would intuit based on things you saw around.  Material analysis is good for a lot of things.  It can help you build a bridge or manage an economy.  It can't tell you whether a poem is good.  Materialism can help you feed the homeless.  It can't tell you people dying of starvation is bad.  That's something you have to determine outside of material analysis, and then you use material analysis to achieve your goal of stopping people from starving to death.  To suggest that in order to be a materialist, one must therefore reject any thought that is not materialist is nonsense!  It's cobbledy-cook!  It sounds meaningful until you think about it for even, like, a fucking second.  Oh, sorry, honey.  I can't say that I love you.  As a materialist, I have to wait until love is discovered in laboratory conditions.  What do I want on my pizza?  Irrelevant!  Bring me the most nutritionally complete ingredients and arrange them in the most efficient way.  No anesthetic for me, doctor.  Pain is merely a sensation within the body, not material reality.  Begin the surgery, please.  It's horseshit and she knows it.  The whole idea that this is merely material analysis is a fig leaf.  A way to lend an air of objectivity to what she's saying.  Hey, oh, oh, hey, I don't got a problem with the individuals.  I'm just following the science.  I don't know why she's from New York now.  Oh, hey, I'm doing a hate speech over here.  A little bit later, she goes into the same tired logic about how feminism and race theory divide the working class.  That's what she's really mad about, and she'll use whatever specious logic it takes to make that point. ",

Hello and welcome to the Eyeball Zone.  You escaped our grasp last week.  You eluded us only briefly.  You have but delayed the inevitable.  We have found you once more.  And nothing will stop us from highlighting small leftist content.  Hey!  Biological sex isn't a very accurate idea, don't you think?  Want to see someone perform some actual material analysis on that?  Check out this video from Lekstra, where she outlines how the whole idea is.  just kind of nonsense, just a bunch of nonsense that seems to make sense on the surface, but breaks down under actual scrutiny.  A lot of common-sense assumptions that we make about sex are just kind of guesses, like weird approximations of what is usually true, and that can lead to... problems, to say the least.  Woe betide you!  Robbed of my power last week, I will exact double my usual toll.  Hey, I don't want you to watch this video and come away thinking that I think materialist thinking is bad.  I consider myself a materialist.  I think materialism is important.  I believe in science.  I I fucking love science, and I want people to take materialist thinking seriously.  That's why I love this video by Ordinary Snowflake that goes into how skeptic communication can often rely on condescension and actually turn people away from scientific consensus.  A lot of the times we just use science to treat people like dum-dums, and then they're like, well fuck you then, I don't believe in vaccines.  Do you have a small leftist project which you're willing to sacrifice to gain the power of eyeballs?  Send me no more than one email at thoughtslimeeditor at gmail.com and perhaps you will find yourself trapped here in the eyeball zone.  Hey, thanks for watching this video.  I hope you liked it.
