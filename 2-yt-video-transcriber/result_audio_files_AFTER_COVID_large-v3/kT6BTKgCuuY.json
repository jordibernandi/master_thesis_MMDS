            "text": "Okay, 7.59  a.m.,  January 13, 2021.  This could be a little bit more calm than my previous video.  I haven't made videos in a long time.  My wife is very ill.  We're old people.  I'm 67.  That'll give you some idea.  I'm a three-time cancer survivor, so we've got issues, right?  And in this COVID stuff, I've had a lot of work to do.  I took a virology course, the Columbia University virology course, also took half of their molecular biology course to support what I was trying to learn in their virology course.  So I consider myself knowledgeable in that.  This video here now is going to be about experts and two individuals and I'm going to discuss the individuals by name and tell you explicitly why I'm doing so and then I'll discuss experts in general.  okay and so the two individuals are penny Kelly and Simon Parks.  both of these people have a YouTube channels.  this is all in my opinion okay.  so I am irritated at Simon Parks because Simon, and I'm not, irritated at Penny Kelly, even though they both share a common flaw in what they're presenting.  I think Penny Kelly, to be a legit smart human who has not enough background information to draw correct conclusions from what she's being presented by her sources.  So, in other words, you could be a great fucking psychic and still... totally fucking wrong on on stuff because the person you're trying to be psychic to um comes from a culture that you don't have a background to correctly analyze what you're being presented about their culture.  right i mean it's it's an obscure reference but You need a consistent background and a good view of universe in order to be able to make accurate forecasts of things.  And Penny Kelly has an inaccurate understanding of... AI, artificial intelligence, and quantum computers.  Simon Parks has that same inaccurate understanding of AI and quantum computers, but he's a grifting shill and is selling stories that are promoting illusions that will get people killed.  Okay, so I'm not pissed at Penny Kelly.  I've got to go and look at the rest of her video.  Maybe I will be pissed at her.  But I got to the point where she started talking about quantum computers, and I realized she has not got the central concept of those.  Quantum computers don't sit there and run like these computers that we have right now.  these digital machines.  In fact, you need a digital computer to fire off a quantum computer.  And that fire off is accurate.  They don't sit there and run stuff.  They can't run an artificial intelligence program.  All they can do is run a chunk of software to deliver a single specific answer to the software, not to generalize questions.  You can't ask the computer, you can't ask the quantum computer shit.  OK, you have to work your ass off to write these programs and hope that you've got enough grasp of both the problem and the computing solution to make the quantum computer perform.  Then you have to fire it on that same chunk of software at least three times in order to get two answers that maybe you can trust.  And basically, those two answers are only ever going to be probabilistically within the 80% percentile for being correct.  So quantum computers are analog.  They can't run AI software.  They can't be asked wide-ranging conclusions.  You don't map energy fields with them.  That is a misunderstanding, Penny.  It does not function that way.  Now, Simon Parks, he's a real fucker, okay, because he's promoting this scenario that there is this secret group of military people that had a quantum computer that somehow could peer through future, into the future, and deliver shit, right?  And, like, specific answers to specific questions about the collapse of the potentiality into probability into manifestation. ",
