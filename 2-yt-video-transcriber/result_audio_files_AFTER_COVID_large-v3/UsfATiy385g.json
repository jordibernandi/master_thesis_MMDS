He's doing a video here on a 30-something woman.  Her name is Candy Dawn Amber.  Spilling the tea, the truth about being single in your 30s.  Now, I have no animosity or anything toward this woman.  I mean, she, you know, she had her fun, right?  Probably in her 20s, she was out doing whatever she did.  That's fine.  That's, you know... Part of me actually says to me, you know what?  You only live once, dude.  So can you really be against going out and doing all this stuff?  Okay.  Yeah, I get that.  I get it.  And I'm sure it's fun, you know, experiencing all of that lovely stuff.  But the problem comes in when we get to this point where this woman is now 36.  This video is a couple years ago when she did this one.  And she can't find the man that she was told by feminism, by this, by that, by the society.  You do whatever you want.  Go out there and you do it, man.  You know, just like the men.  Because they're evil.  Just go do the same thing as those evil mans.  And when you are ready, when it's time, when you feel the baby rabies kicking in, Prince Charming will just come right to your door.  You don't have to do a thing.  He'll be there when you're ready.  Unfortunately, it doesn't work that way. ",
