Investigators noted that they believe the source married a US citizen in 2000 with the sole intent of obtaining immigration benefits, but was denied lawful permanent residence status based on the fraudulent marriage, which was denied.  The source has remained in the US without lawful immigration status and is still subject to criminal and immigration consequences.
