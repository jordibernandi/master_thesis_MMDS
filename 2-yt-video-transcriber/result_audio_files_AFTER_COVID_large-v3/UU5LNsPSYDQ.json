            "text": "Earlier this year, I talked about how Jordan Peterson, the lobster-loving, monogamy-pushing, alt-right psychologist, backtracked ever so slightly on his insistence that all of your problems can be solved with personal responsibility by developing an addiction to benzos, dropping out of rehab, flying to Russia to pay doctors to give him a scientifically suspect rapid detox treatment, which gave him brain damage.  Allow me to catch you up on what has happened in the six months since.  It got worse.  When Peterson woke up from the coma that the doctors put him in for detox, he was unable to walk or talk and he had pneumonia, which nearly killed him.  But he pulled through and he was apparently getting better with months and months of therapy in Russia and then in Florida.  But then, for some reason, he decided to travel from Florida to Serbia to continue with therapy.  Not therapy for the brain damage he got from the rapid detox.  According to this interview he did with a Serbian newspaper, he was there still seeking treatment for his addiction to benzos.  So the rapid detox didn't even work to help his withdrawal symptoms and or his addiction.  which isn't exactly surprising.  As I mentioned in the previous video, rapid detox is much more dangerous than slow tapering.  Patients are likely to renew their drug use, it can actually make withdrawal symptoms much worse than simply tapering, which is why you can't get rapid detox treatment anywhere in the United States or Canada, which is why Peterson had to go to Russia.  So now he's in Serbia with his daughter, Mikula Peterson.  You may remember Michaela from this video I made nearly a year ago, in which I criticized her for pretending to be a health guru, claiming that she cured her own chronic Lyme disease and many other afflictions by switching to an all-meat diet, like literally all meat, which is stupid and unhealthy and gross.  She was charging people $599 a year to join a support group where they could talk about how great their farts smell now or whatever, that forum is sadly no longer active.  And I have no idea if anyone actually paid her $599 and if they did, if they got a refund for like the nine months or whatever that they didn't get to use it.  Speaking of Mikayla, she recorded a podcast with her dad in which they defend their actions from the past year.  answering such important questions as, why would Jordan Peterson, a psychologist who specializes in addiction, try to go cold turkey off of benzos instead of properly tapering?

            "text": "Well, I went from four milligrams a day to zero last May, and that wasn't... tolerable.  so i went back up but not part of the reason you did that is people would be like why would you do that?  you're supposed to taper.  first of all if you don't know about benzodiazepines it's not obvious that you have to taper like.

            "text": "i know that being an expert in something doesn't always mean that you're going to take your own advice but he's literally an expert in addiction.  Mikaela and her Russian husband are the ones who got Jordan Peterson into that detox program.  And Mikaela stayed with Jordan throughout his travels through Russia and Europe.  Once in Europe, she made no secret of the fact that she was going out to clubs, despite the fact that by this point COVID-19 was in full pandemic swing.  She even posted to her Instagram stories a video of her taking a drag off a hookah with the words coronavirus.  Never heard of it.  Hashtag Serbian vibes.  Because of course they're COVID-19 deniers.  Again, this is while she was staying with her father who nearly died of pneumonia a few months prior and who was still in treatment for benzo addiction.  So you probably see where this is going.  The entire family got COVID-19.  Here's what she wrote on Instagram.  We got to Belgrade and the country was completely open.  No masks necessary.  A month later, everything shut down again after elections.  Politics.  We all went back into quarantine because we're with my dad and he's high risk.  He already had pneumonia this year.  Ten days into the strict quarantine, and I mean strict, we didn't go outside of the property, my toddler got symptoms of a flu, swiftly followed by the rest of us.  Turns out a lot of people in Belgrade caught it.  She must have caught it at the playground.  Okay, I'm just going to pause it right there.  Ten days into the strict quarantine, and I mean strict, does not exactly jive with the literal next sentence, she must have caught it at the playground.  Like... No, you can't say you were strict and then blame your toddler for playing on a public playground.  Also, was this playground outside?  Because studies show that transmission outside is extraordinarily rare unless you're having long face-to-face conversations with someone who has it or if you're in a crowded environment like an outdoor bar or a music festival.  It's far, far more likely that you will catch it inside like, oh, I don't know, at a hookah bar where you're sharing a hookah with people inside during a pandemic.  She goes on to say that Jordan's doctor said 40% of his lungs were affected by the virus, but then reiterated that she doesn't think lockdowns help and it's not really a big deal.  You know what, maybe she's right.  Maybe lockdowns don't work because there are too many complete and utter morons who are violating it.  She says that the family is now totally recovered, but Jordan's fans aren't so sure because she's being a bit stingy with the old proof of life.  Over on the Joe Rogan subreddit, I know, they're convinced that Michaela is trying to murder her meal ticket, first by kidnapping him and forcing him to undergo a dangerous pseudoscientific treatment, and then by literally giving him COVID-19.  People who are fans of Jordan Peterson's blunt philosophy of self-reliance and facts over feelings have no idea how to interpret this insane series of events.  And instead of just realizing that Jordan Peterson has always been a fraud and a moron, they've decided to fall back on that old chestnut misogyny.  Obviously, Jordan Peterson is not just a smooth-brained con artist.  It's just that Michaela is the con artist and Jordan has this soft spot for his daughter.  So she has used her ingenious wiles to make him do as she pleases, forcing him first to help her shill her all-meat diet then to promote her podcast, to hand over the keys to his social media, to get addicted to benzos, to go to Russia against his true desires, and now to sit feebly in a Belgrade apartment while she flounces around town catching deadly viruses and giving them to him.  Ultimately, she will murder him, make it look like yet another hapless accident in a long series of whoopsies, and she'll take her seat at the throne of the Peterson kingdom, where she will rule pseudo-intellectual incels with an iron fist.  I mean, personally, I'm going to continue to ascribe to the belief that Jordan Peterson is a moron who is ruining his life by making terrible, ill-informed decisions.  And such a person has managed to raise a daughter with a similar level of intellect and life skills.  But I think you'll agree that each of these theories has equal amounts of data to support it.  I guess I'm supposed to end this video by saying I hope Jordan Peterson recovers soon.  So technically I just did that. ",
