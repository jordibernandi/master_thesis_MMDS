            "text": "There is a balance that I think a lot of people get confused on.  when you hear Calvinist and you hear preordained, you think, oh, well, you don't believe in any free will at all.  And that's not true.  Now, I will say there is what kind of seems like a conundrum or a conflict between personal responsibility and absolute sovereignty of God.  So we believe that God is absolutely sovereign over everything.  There is no point whatsoever where he sits back and he just lets things happen or says, oh, whoops, like I didn't see that coming.  We believe in the absolute sovereignty of God over everything.  And yet the Bible is very clear that people have personal responsibility and that the Christians believe if you don't accept Christ, which accept is kind of a word that we don't really use in Calvinism, but that there is punishment, there's eternal punishment for that, there's eternal separation from God.  And so you are held to the consequences of your sin, to the consequences of the life that you live, and yet God is sovereign over all of that. ",

            "text": "How do you square that circle?  You square that circle with Romans 9. that says that, that asks that very question.  And so the Romans were asking that question, okay, well, how can God find fault?  If he destines people to hell, if he says that you are going to be separated from me forever, why would God create anyone like that?  Knowing that they're going to spend eternity without him.  And Paul answers that with another question.  He says, well, the clay say to the potter, why did you make me this way?  God is going to harden whom he wills and he will have mercy on whom he wills.  the same way that He hardened Pharaoh.  That is God's will.  He is sovereign.  And who are we to ask God?  whether or not He is just?  God does the things that He does that are higher than our ways and higher than our thoughts.  And that's something that I don't think any Calvinist pretends to understand or anyone who reads Romans 9 pretends to understand.  Why would God create what Romans 9 calls vessels of wrath and vessels of mercy?  And the answer really is for His own glory.  So how do you create buy-in to the systems of theology you're preaching?  You say that in this particular podcast that you do, you assume that people are coming because they already have a certain level of buy-in, but are you attempting to? ",

            "text": "Okay, my tongue's bleeding a little bit because I was biting it so hard during that segment.  I've heard it like three times just to preparation and still bite my tongue.  I just can't stand it.  I was holding up my book because I've written a verse-by-verse commentary of Romans 8 and into 9.  And It's just so aggravating.  And the reason it's so aggravating is, one, it's interesting.  If you read Schreiner and some of the higher level Calvinists that are out there, they don't even go to that base level interpretation of Romans 9 that you just heard from Allie.  Now, again, she... She's not a theologian.  She's not trained in that area.  And so I'm not trying to say that.  But she took what most millennials and lay people think that Romans 9 is really saying, even from the Calvinist, the best Calvinistic sources.  And that's what's so interesting is that the best Calvinistic sources don't even go to that extreme on the interpretations of Romans 9.  Because notice the way that she painted it.  She paints it as double predestination.  She paints it as God has chosen some people for salvation and other people of reprobation.  And the questioner, the objector of Romans 9 is going to be asking, then why are we still to blame?  And Paul is saying to that Arminian or that provisionist out there who's asking that stupid, silly question of how are you square in that circle, who are you to question God Almighty for how he has molded his clay?  If he wants to mold some pieces of clay for damnation before they're ever born, and if he wants to mold other pieces of vessels for his good and his glory before they're ever born, then who are you to talk back to the maker of heavens and earth, the one who frames and molds everything?  That's what Paul is talking about in Romans 9.  He is defending Calvinism.  He is defending reprobation.  He is defending the concept of eternal election of individuals for effectual salvation.  And who are you to talk back to him?  That's kind of the view that she took there.  And she pulls out vessels of wrath and vessels of mercy.  She can have mercy on whom he wants to have mercy, and he can harden whom he wants to harden, she was arguing there in that broadcast.  Now, is there other alternatives to that interpretation?  Yes, okay, there is.  In fact, the same people who are hardened, the same individuals who are hardened in Romans 9, are the very same ones that Paul holds out hope will be grafted back in if they leave their unbelief and are provoked to envy through his ministry to the Gentiles over in chapter 11.  So we know that they are not this reprobate of the Calvinistic worldview because the same ones who are stumbling, he says in chapter 11, verse 11, haven't stumbled beyond recovery.  He even says that the reason they're cut off arbitrarily before they're ever born, but they're cut off because of their unbelief in chapter 11, verses 20 through 23.  And he actually hopes that they will leave their unbelief so as to be grafted back in to the branch.  So why in the world would we conclude that Calvinism is the interpretation when Paul himself doesn't conclude that in his own conclusion, in his own follow-up to his message?  The point of Romans 9 is we've gone over on other broadcasts, and I'll point you to those other broadcasts.  I can put a link in the show notes of my two-hour line-by-line commentary of Romans 9 where I actually read from The Potter's Promise, my book that's available on Amazon if you're interested in that.  And you can see for yourself how to interpret this passage.  And it makes, to me nowadays, it makes so much more sense.  As I've talked about in previous broadcasts, sometimes people, when they look at a particular picture, they see the duck or the rabbit.  Well, sometimes when they approach Romans 9, they see a duck or they see a rabbit.  They see something else being described than the other person does.  And you're really not qualified to decide which Paul is describing the until you can understand both perspectives equally well.  And very few millennial Calvinists, kind of the new Calvinists that are growing up right now into our popularity, like we see here on the Ben Shapiro show, very few of them really understand both the duck and the rabbit.  They've just heard... Romans 9 explained from the Calvinistic perspective, and they think, oh, well, that's obviously a duck.  It's obviously talking about reprobation.  It's obviously talking about double predestination here, and this is a defense of it.  And who are you to question what God chooses to do?  Versus understanding that when God says, I will have mercy on whom I'll have mercy, mercy does not mean to effectually save somebody.  Okay?  Mercy has never meant that.  Mercy means to show patience to somebody and to refrain from punishing them when they deserve to be punished.  Okay?  First and foremost.  So when God says, I will have mercy on whom I'll have mercy, he's not even talking about whether he's going to save them or not.  Okay?  He's talking about... having patience, showing patience to the nation of Israel.  He's quoting from Exodus 32 and 33 when Israel had just built the golden calf and he's about to kill them for this horrible sin.  And Moses steps in and intercedes as the Christ-like figure, the Messiah-like figure in the first episode of the Passover.  He steps in and says, God, if you're going to blot them out, take me out with them.  remember your promise to Abraham.  Don't kill them.  Show them mercy.  And in that context, God says, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy.  In other words, I'm going to refrain from punishing the nation of Israel.  in order to fulfill my promise to  Abraham.\".  Now, why would that be important in Romans 9?  Well, look back at verse 6.  He's asked the question, has God's promise failed with regard to Israel?  And he's going through and showing through history lesson, God's promise has not failed.  He can have mercy when he wants to have mercy on this nation in order to accomplish his promise through them.  But guess what?  He can also harden this nation when it serves his purpose to harden this nation.  Now, what does hardening mean?  Does it mean to damn somebody to an eternal hell before they're ever born? ",

            "text": "To harden somebody means to... The literal word in the original language is to strengthen one in their resolve.  And so... As many commentators say, God never hardens somebody that's not already hardened themselves in stubborn rebellion against him.  And that's exactly where the nation of Israel is at this time.  They are in this self-righteous state of stupor, this condition by which they think they don't need a physician because they are the physician.  They're the old wineskins that can't take the new wine.  They have become self-righteous.  And God is, in a sense, giving them over, hardening them over.  are strengthening them in their resolve, saying, okay, you think you can do this yourself?  You think you can be on your own gods?  You go and do what you want to do.  And he hardens them, strengthens them in the resolve so as to accomplish the crucifixion through their rebellion and to accomplish the engrafting of the Gentile nations who would not have been grafted in had the Gentiles not allowed them to come into the church because of their bias against the barbarian Gentile nations.  And so God is accomplishing his purpose through the mercying of Israel and then the hardening of Israel at different times.  Now, Moses was the type of the Messiah figure in the original Passover event, right?  Most people who read Hebrews or preachers through the Exodus event, they know this.  This is God's history.  It's his story.  He's foreshadowing, in a sense, what is to come in the second Passover.  Well, Moses represents Christ because he's the redeeming figure in the story.  It doesn't mean he's just like Christ in every way, but it means that he's a type, a foreshadowing of.  Well, who is Pharaoh foreshadowing?  Well, Pharaoh, already a rebellious, self-righteous man who thinks he's got it all figured out, is hardened.  he's strengthened in his resolved.  it doesn't mean that god didn't didn't ever love pharaoh or doesn't ever want pharaoh.  it means that god took an already marred lump of clay i.e pharaoh.  he was already hardened.  he was already calloused because of his own self-righteous rebellion not because god didn't love him not because god didn't provide for him.  he had everything he needed i.e.  Romans 1.  He had everything he needed to believe and to know who God was.  He had a conscience, i.e.  Romans 2.  He knew what was right and wrong, but he suppressed the truth.  He grew calloused.  He grew hardened.  And God took this already hardened lump of clay called Pharaoh.  He raised him up for the very purpose of displaying his power through this already hardened, stubborn lump.  And he strengthens him in his already stubborn, rebellious ways.  And blinds him from the truth of what the plagues were revealing.  That Moses was serving the true one God.  Therefore he is displaying his power over all the gods of Egypt.  In each one of those plagues.  Each one of those plagues were destroying the false gods of the Egyptians.  And his power was displayed through every single one of those plagues.  So God hardened Pharaoh's heart.  in order to accomplish the first Passover in the same way that he hardens Israel's heart in order to accomplish the second Passover.  Do you see the beauty of this, guys?  Why is Paul pulling up Pharaoh here?  Why is he mentioning Pharaoh?  Because he's a type of Israel.  In the same way that God strengthened Pharaoh in his resolve so as to accomplish the first Passover, God is strengthening Israel in their resolve.  He is strengthening them, hardening them in their resolve so as to bring about the second Passover.  So the vessels of wrath he's talking about, These are hardened individuals, hardened people.  The hardened nation of Israel is the vessel of wrath who has prepared themselves, this is a passive form of the verb, prepared themselves for destruction.  And he's molding and using them in their already callous condition to bring about his redemptive plan for the world. ",
