            "text": "shalom call hello you.  how about you?  and i was shy by shimmer carpet dash double honors into the apostles and the elders.  salutations to all my fellow laborers doing this work in truth and sincerity risking their lives and their freedom to do so now more so than ever.  to the scattered elect that are scattered around the four corners of the earth to be like unto the speckled bird the israelite foreigners And to the few Aquaf that are listening and learning, to you I say, Shalom.  This is your brother Malcolm coming at you with another lesson in truth.  And yeah, this video is kind of like killing two birds with one stone.  It was really meant to be a response to do.  I have to marry a Hebrew man, which was put up by a faithful servant of Yahuwah.  And on his channel and um but looking and you know and in lieu of all the things that are happening in the capital guns drawn you know people attacking these these edamites acting like animals acting like niggers when you actually see you know these these white men tearing up and destroying things.  they finally call them what they are animals terrorists and um you know, and thugs, because it's funny how they could, you know, when they do things for many, many years, they'll show riots and, And they show you, you know, they'll show you people of color, you know, protesting and they call it a riot.  And then they'll show you people, you know, pale people, and they'll call it a protest.  Well, this was an all-out riot, gun-toting Edomites that, you know, that attacked the Capitol and destroyed the White House, which was built by so-called black men, by the way, so-called slaves.  But nevertheless... Oh, he's standing behind a bulletproof glass.  That's why it looks that way.  But in the days that are coming, the answer to the question, do I need to marry a Hebrew man?  Well, it would be foolish not to be.  Why would you not want to be?  As a matter of fact, every woman is going to want to be.  And the question was asked by a sister who, who seems sincere according to the brother, but she was talking about how she, you know, her daughters were grown or her daughter or daughters.  I don't know.  She had two, one or two and that she was divorced and she just didn't want to put all that time and stuff.  And she didn't really want to enter men like that.  And she didn't, you know, et cetera, et cetera.  But she's a sister that believes and, um, and calls on the name of how about she, when I was shy, she watches and she learns.  Well, That's good.  And no, you don't have to marry, you know, give yourself into a man on his side.  All right.  Because if you are of the elect, if you're watching and learning, you may be of that group of women who are going to be saved for childbearing.  It's the number one reason why women are being saved.  The Israelite woman is being is being saved that she may bear children to the elect men of Israel, the judges and the rest of the elect men.  And I'm going to get a scripture to substantiate that.  That scripture is, hold on, I believe it's Timothy.  Right, 1 Timothy 2 and 15, and it reads, notwithstanding, she shall be saved in childbearing.  If they continue in faith, believe in them, upon you, how about you?  I was shy.  Goddamn commercial.  Damn.  If they believe upon you, how about you?  And I was shy and in charity giving unto the cause.  All right.  And in holiness and sobriety.  So if you are, if you do belong to a woman of an Israelite male, you need to support him no matter what, especially in these days.  It would be really foolish to step away or walk away from your covering.  It just doesn't make sense.  And for what?  To be in the world alone as it's ending, as the Lord, as the change is coming?  I don't, you know, that, yeah.  So I don't know why she would not want to be with a Hebrew man, all right?  But, you know, she's an older woman who's not, you know, who's pretty much on her own.  And, you know, I can understand that, but just know and believe when you, when you come down off of the chariots and when we come down into new Jerusalem, when it's coming down, you're going to be changed in an instant, you know, and you're going to be young and healthy and lovely, and you will be the wife of one of the 144,000 or one of the other, you know, just the regular elect men, because a few of the elect will be men too, you know, but the majority will be women.  for that reason, so that they can be the wives of the elect men and bring forth all those children.  Because why?  We got to bring two-thirds of our nation back.  right two-thirds of our nation has to come back and they're gonna come back through marriage and sex is marriage.  that's how you know all right.  That's how you get to know someone.  You don't get to know them by knowing.  See, this Western effeminized Edomite society has destroyed the mindset of both the man and the woman.  And they have these bugged out.  Women want this incredible man to be both sensitive and rugged and handsome and strong and all these other things.  But then they also want him to be soft as hell at the same time.  And that's not the purpose, the purpose of the man or the way of a man.  All right.  This is Genesis 24 and 67.  And it reads that Isaac brought her into his mother, Sarah's tent and took Rebecca.  All right.  So you best believe he took her.  He had a this way, that way, sideways, upside down.  He took her all night long.  All right.  And she became his wife.  And Isaac was comforted after his mother's death.  His mother died.  So sex is comfort for men.  And a lot of women can't seem to grasp that.  All right.  It even tells you that the more that they oppressed us, the more we produced in Egypt.  Why?  Because that's the way they get out of the frustration.  Okay.  So men and women are wired different.  But women want this man, you know, men to like sit back and and not have sex and, you know, and and be more sensitive and talk.  And, you know, that's all a bunch of junk.  They're all a bunch of lies, because the truth is that women like sex just as much as men do, maybe even more with as much as don't you.  that goes on among women.  All right.  Just to be just to be real and true about it, because, you know, it comes out to the fact, man, it don't matter how big your rod is, how much you rock a boat, how much you get her off.  A woman will still seek to to to have another penis, to have another ride.  They just will.  You know, that that carousel is very, very real.  And if you, you know, if you're dating a woman that's been on it, chances, you know, at any given moment, she can she can she can get off you and jump right back on that carousel.  All right, which is often what they do.  Which would, you know, but nevertheless, this really isn't about that.  But that happens and it happens a lot in this.  And especially that is really foolish when we this close to the to the end.  And that's still an issue because the Lord is going to take all that away when he makes us perfect.  And our women are going to be perfect, too.  And not only are women going to desire us, all women are going to desire us.  And the funny thing is in our low state, that's often the case now.  Even when we're in our low state, the heathen women kind of lean toward Jacob.  But this is Isaiah 16 and 14.  And I always say, man, if we can get that woman now when we have nothing, how much more when we have everything?  All right?  But this is Isaiah 16 and 14.  It says, the sons also of them that afflicted thee shall come bending unto thee, and they that despise thee shall bow themselves down at the soles of thy feet, and they shall call thee the city of Jehovah, the Zion of the Holy One of Israel, right?  Because they're going to bend the knee to us, all right?  Let me jump down to verse 16.  And it says, thou shalt also suck the milk of the Gentiles, meaning their substance, their wealth.  Everything that they have is going to be given unto us.  They're going to become tributaries unto our cause.  They have to build our kingdom for free.  Another commercial.  Yeah, and these heathen women are going to be getting in shape, getting it right for us too.  But come on, get them off the screen.  It says, but thou shalt suck the milk of the Gentiles and shalt suck the breasts of kings.  And thou and thou shall know that I am the savior and the redeemer and the mighty one of Jacob.  All right.  And when it says suck in the milk, man, it's talking about the substance, the wealth of their lands.  You know, the best of everything that they have, they're going to have to bring to us first.  They're going to have to deal with what's left over.  All nations have to go into slavery service and build our kingdom.  Point blank period.  It tells you that in Revelation.  The 13th chapter, all right?  That's the end book, the end game.  What happens in the end, all right?  Revelation 13 and nine, it says, if any man have an ear, let him hear, all right?  And it reads, he that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity.  And he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword.  Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.  The saints are patiently waiting to put into captivity those that put them in captivity and killed them with the sword all day long.  Jake's still getting shot down.  The modern day sword is the gun and Jake gets killed by the sword all day long by their enemies.  All right, you got a lot of Jake that kill other Jake, but it's a lot, but the majority of Jake over the centuries have been killed by their enemies, enslaved by their enemies.  All right, and now you're still slaves.  You're just slaves to the paperwork now.  All right, through contracts, contractual chains.  All right, sometimes you enter into those contracts involuntarily.  They put you in the contract.  And look, these people are fighting with the police and spraying the police.  And it was funny, I watched them breach the White House.  On one occasion, and you saw the Jake security officer, you know, trying to stop the Edomites.  And I just thought to myself, if this were the other way around, the Edomites would have been able to stand their ground, shoot and kill them, and then nothing would have been done.  But in his mind, he knew if I start beating and shooting these white people, they're going to put me, even though I'm defending the White House, they're going to shame me, probably lock me up, lose my job and everything else.  But you best believe had that been the other way around, it would have went down.  All right.  But let's go back to the scripture.  Let's go to Isaiah, the 49th chapter.  In verse 22 and 23, and it reads.  49.  And it reads, thus, if you have a power, behold, I will lift up my hand to the Gentiles and set my.  Set my standard to the people and they shall bring their sons in their arms.  That's a lucky.  They shall bring thy sons in their arms and thy daughter shall be carried upon their shoulders.  They're gonna be nursing maids and help mates and servants unto us.  Would you want to be with the man who's the servant or the man who has the servants?  All right verse 23 and Kings.  So we're talking about kings and kings shall be thy nursing fathers and their queens, thy nursing mothers, and they shall bow down to thee with their face toward the earth and lick up the dust of thy feet.  And thou shall know that I am your power, but they shall not be ashamed that wait for me.  That's why we're waiting patiently with suffering through all this indignity, you know, through all this wrongdoing by Esau and by our own people and by our women.  All right?  We're suffering through it all.  All right?  Because you best believe it comes out every week.  Isaiah 4 and 1 is very close at hand.  Okay?  And it says, And in that day, seven women shall take hold of one man, saying, We will eat our own bread and wear our own apparel.  Only let us be called by thy name to take away our reproach.  And how are you called by a man's name?  You have to marry him.  And let's go back to review what marriage is again.  Genesis 24 and 67.  Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent and took Rebecca and she became his wife and he loved her.  And Isaac was comforted after his mother's death.  So you're going to be taken by that that mighty man.  And we are indeed going to be mighty.  Much mightier than we are now.  And we clearly are amongst the mightiest of the men on the planet.  We are, indeed.  But we're going to, like I always say it jokingly, but I'm dead serious.  The Israelite man is going to be so much man that one wife will not be able to deal with him.  You won't physically be able to handle him.  You're going to need some assistance.  You're going to need another sister wife to give you a break.  Especially with the power and the strength, the size and the virility.  And the strength of not fatiguing.  You're not going to be able to deal with that man.  All right?  And that's just keeping it real.  That's real talk, man.  All right?  This is Zachariah 12 and 6.  And it reads, And in that day, I will make governors of Judah like the hearth of fire among the wood and the torch of fire in a sheaf, and they shall devour all people round about.  So you wanna be with the men that are being devoured?  Of course you have to marry a Israelite man.  You don't have to marry him on this side.  You just stay, you know, just keep serving the Lord.  Keep whatever teachers that you're watching, Whatever men that you're watching and learning from, you know, and yet you're supporting whatever ministry, just keep doing that.  That very man that you're watching may be your husband.  You're already drawn to whoever it is that you're watching.  So you may end up being one of his wives.  Just be cool.  Because if you have, you know, because you don't, you know, you have a woman on this side, you're going to have trouble in the flesh, man.  There is no marriage and no relationship without having trouble in the flesh.  It's just a fact.  All right?  Because we're still in Babylon.  Even though Babylon is falling, you know, it is falling literally right before your face.  All right, but yeah, let me read that again.  Zechariah 12 and six.  And in that day, I will make the governors of Judah like an hearth of fire among the wood and like a torch of fire in a sheaf.  And they shall devour all people round about on the right hand and on the left.  And Jerusalem shall be inhabited again, her own place, even in Jerusalem.  All right.  So let me read verse seven.  Yehowah also shall save the tents of Judah first, that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem do not magnify themselves against Judah.  And Judah caught the most hell in this captivity.  We all caught hell, but our Judahite brothers caught it the most.  Why?  Because they're the head tribe and the prophecies came to pass just as it was written.  Judah woke up first and Judah had to come into this thing first.  And then the northern kingdom began to trickle in.  And then you look at the time frame, America, Babylon is the place is the is the number one place in the world where all 12 tribes dwell.  So there's going to be a great deliverance here.  You know, Judah and Gad were here, you know, you know, together for forever.  And then, you know, in the early 1900s, you know, Issachar was rolling in.  Well, Issachar was here, too.  And then the other tribes begin to come in.  I know Ephraim started coming in in the 40s or 50s.  Then the Simeonites began coming in.  Then the, you know, Hades, you know, the Levites and the Benjamites.  And now all the tribes have areas here in America where they dwell.  All right.  And a lot of them are in the camps that are around about Babylon.  And around the world, you know, we got our speckled bird brothers that are among us here in Babylon and around the world.  All right.  And this is making Esau very, very nervous.  All right.  Just like these people were panicking and nervous, you know, talking about what was going on in the U.S.  All right.  So the answer is unequivocally yes.  You will have to marry a Hebrew man.  You don't have to necessarily marry him now on this side.  Just keep doing what you're doing.  And because time is short.  So, you know, the Lord is coming.  This craziness is going to happen.  And then the Israelites are finally going to get delivered out of Jacob's trouble after we go through a lot of hell.  And then we're going to be changed, going to those chariots.  And then you're going to come off that chariot and you're going to and then you're going to be your husband.  You know, however, the Lord is going to work it out.  I'm not 100 percent sure.  There's no scripture that says it.  But, you know, he's either going to choose you or the Lord is going to send you to him.  However, it's going to work.  That's how it's going to work.  All right.  So with that, we're going to give all praises going on to your howl by Hashem, your howl by Hashem, your howl by Hashem, your howl by Hashem. ",
