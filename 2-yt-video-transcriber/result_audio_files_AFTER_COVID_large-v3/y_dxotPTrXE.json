That's where Joe Biden's story starts, in working class neighborhoods where you could make a good living and pass on a better life to your kids.  That's why Joe Biden went into public service to begin with, to make a difference for working families.  Donald Trump, he ran for president for himself and for his friends on Wall Street.  For Donald Trump, it's about those at the top.  For Joe Biden, it's about the backbone of this nation, working families.  This crisis has revealed that we must do more for workers and small businesses, not the wealthy.  And Joe Biden is the one to do it, to build back better.  I'm Joe Biden, and I approve this message.
