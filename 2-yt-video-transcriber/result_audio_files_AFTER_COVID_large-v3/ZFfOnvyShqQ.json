            "text": "Shalom, I'm Messianic Rabbi Zef Porat, and welcome to Biblical Hebrew Foundation.  Today I want to be speaking to you about the seal of the Holy Spirit and how it applies to us as believers in Yeshua as we run the race and make it to the end.  In these difficult, hard times, the Word of God is what encourages us.  The Word of God is what is supposed to keep us focused in this world.  As Jesus Yeshua said, we are in the world, but we are not of the world.  Ephesians chapter one, verse 13.  And in him having heard and believed the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, you were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit.  And we know that the word for salvation is the word Yeshua.  So what it's saying is, and in him having heard and believed the word of truth, the gospel of Yeshua, Jesus, you were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit, the Woch HaKodesh.  Now, of course, this is speaking about a compound Bible prophecy, because number one, it's speaking about when you accepted Jesus as Lord and Savior, the Holy Spirit filled you up.  The seal of the Holy Spirit is speaking about running the race, making it into the end, consummating the marriage.  Because right now, you and I are in stage number one.  which is the betrothal process.  We have to run the race and make it to the end in order to consummate the marriage with Yeshua.  And then we get the eternal seal of redemption as the bride, as the victorious bride of Jesus Yeshua.  Let's have a look at Jeremiah chapter 23, verse six.  In his days, Judah will be saved and Israel will dwell securely.  And this is the name by which he will be called.  the Lord, our righteousness.  And we know that the Bible says that all of us have fallen short of the glory, but through him, we become righteous.  Through him, we become priests.  And this Bible verse here, Jeremiah chapter 23, verse six is also a compound prophecy because we're in the world, we're not of the world, but we dwell safely in Messiah Yeshua in the midst of the COVID-19, in the midst of hardship, in the midst of persecution, sickness, disease, financial burden, whatever you're going through, you're still safe because you're under his wings.  You're under his protection.  But there's going to come a time where the bride of Jesus is going to consummate the marriage, the bride of Yeshua.  And when she consummates the marriage, according to the word of God, she will receive the seal, the mark of the Holy Spirit, Forever and evermore, which is really the name of God, the name of Yeshua HaMashiach.  And this is why it says right here in Jeremiah 33, verse 16, very important.  This is exactly what the Hebrew says here.  In those days, Judah will be saved and Jerusalem will dwell safely.  and this is the name by which she shall be called the lord our righteousness.  nor and says in hebrew he she shall be called.  a lot of translations don't use the word she but she's exactly what the hebrew says and you can see clearly here that it's speaking about the bride of jesus the bride of yeshua when you receive the mark of the holy spirit the seal of the holy spirit forever and evermore and consummate the marriage as the victorious bride of jesus yeshua.  so when we look at everything that's going on today we should continue to look up.  we should rejoice Because we know that the time is near.  We're not setting any dates, but we know that there's never been a generation closer to the second coming of Jesus Yeshua than this generation.  And we eagerly wait for the date where we meet the Lord in the air, come back to reign with him after the marriage for a thousand years, and then dwell safely with him.  forever and evermore and have that seal of the Holy Spirit on our head which is really the name of the groom because we saw in Jeremiah 23 that it says and he shall be called the Lord our righteous.  we know that Yeshua is righteous and because we believe in Messiah Yeshua that he is the king of kings and lord of lords that he died on the tree on the cross for our sins.  he rose on the third day.  we begin the patrol process which is a sanctification process.  run the race make it to the end, consummate the marriage, and then one day the Bible says that she shall be called the Lord our righteousness, just like the name of our Lord and Savior, because the bride receives the name of the groom.  Hallelujah.  But until that time, it's our duty to be ambassadors for the kingdom.  It's our duty to run the race and make it to the end.  Die in Messiah Yeshua daily, repent, and beware of false teachings a lot of false teachings out there.  Satan is working overtime to try to get the body of Yeshua running on some kind of an adventure instead of being in the Word of God because he doesn't want you to consummate the marriage he doesn't want you to run the race he doesn't want you to make it to the end because once you receive that final and eternal seal you will be sealed and she shall be called the Lord our righteousness.  By that time, there'll be no more death, no more sickness, no more misery.  You'll be in the new heavens, new earth, new Yerushalayim, new Jerusalem.  So it's important that we stick to sound doctrine, to the word of God and not run after adventures that are not in the word of God.  The Bible is clear.  There's a warning in many places in the Bible.  Let's have a look here at 2 Timothy 4.3.  I've got it on the screen.  For the time will come when people, will not put up with sound doctrine.  We're seeing that right now.  Not everyone, but we are seeing it.  Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear.  Not to hear what the Bible says, not to repent and get ready for Yeshua's second coming, but to run off on some kind of adventure in the name of Yeshua, Jesus, And gather around them a great number of teachers or prophets, I could say also, to say what their itching ears want to hear.  It's not about what you want to hear.  It's not about what I want to hear.  It's about what the Bible says in context.  And I always say this.  The Bible is not a restaurant.  You go to a restaurant, you choose what you want.  What you don't want, you don't choose.  The Bible is not a restaurant.  The Bible is God.  the word of God from Genesis to Revelation.  We eagerly wait for that day.  In those days, Judah will be saved and Jerusalem, Yerushalayim, will dwell safely.  And we know that the eternal safety is not this world.  It's the kingdom, the new heavens, the new earth, the new Jerusalem.  And she shall be called the Lord, our righteousness.  Amazing gift of grace that through Messiah Yeshua, sinful men can become righteous.  Hallelujah.  Let's continue to stand together in prayer.  As we here in Israel are praying for United States of America and for the nations in this difficult time, as you continue to pray for us here in Israel, as we continue to preach the gospel and share the love of Yeshua, and one day we meet the Lord in the air, And we will all be called the Lord, our righteousness.  And she shall be called the Lord, our righteousness.  Hallelujah.  Let's continue to stand together as the one new man, Ephesians 2.15.  Bring the gospel back to Jerusalem and go home.  Until next time, I'm Messianic Rabbi Zef Porat, sending you blessings from Jerusalem, Israel, in the mighty name of the King of Kings and Lord of Lords.  Al Yehuda, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, Jesus Yeshua.  Amen. ",
