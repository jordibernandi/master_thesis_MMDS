VivaFry Montreal litigator turned YouTuber.  We are entering week seven or eight of the global lockdown.  I am vlogging from my home office, my Subaru.  And a change of pace, if you can believe it, today's vlog is going to have nothing to do with the My Sharona Cyrus.  Jussie Smollett, the legal saga that just keeps going on and on and on like the Energizer Bunny.  Who remembers that ad?  How old am I?  I'm old.  I'm getting old.  Jussie Smollett is back in the news with a federal judge granting a motion to dismiss of Jussie Smollett's counterclaim for malicious prosecution.  Now, I don't think I'm going out on a limb anymore by taking for granted that everybody pretty much knows what's going on with the Jussie Smollett situation in general.  That being said, there are some legal procedural things going on that people might be less familiar with.  I have been vlogging the Jussie Smollett legal saga from the very beginning.  I have now compiled an exhaustive playlist of videos on all of the legal questions that have come up in the context of this file.  I'm gonna link that playlist right here, so if you don't know exactly what's going on, go give some of those a watch before watching this video.  But the absolute long and short 30,000 foot overview in a nutshell summary of what's going on is as follows.  Jussie Smollett claimed to be the victim of a homophobic and racist hate crime, which allegedly turned out to be a hoax that he orchestrated against himself.  He allegedly paid two brothers, the Osundaro brothers, $3,000 to carry out the fake attack on himself.  He filed a police report with the Chicago Police Department.  The Chicago Police Department quickly became suspicious of the alleged attack.  After a two-week investigation, it became relatively clear to the Chicago Police Department that it was, in fact, a hoax, and Jussie Smollett filed a false police report.  Jussie Smollett was subsequently indicted on a number of charges, including filing a false police report.  Those charges against him were subsequently dropped in circumstances that can only be described as suspect, to say the least.  The city of Chicago then filed civil proceedings under the Cost Recovery Ordinance, the CRO, and the False Statement Ordinance, the FSO, in order to recover the costs of the investigation into this alleged hoax.  Not only that, but the Osundaro brothers, for their part, sued Jussie Smollett's attorneys for defamation for statements Jussie Smollett's attorneys made in press conferences after the alleged attack.  There were a bunch of other side proceedings that went on in the interim.  Jussie Smollett filed a motion for transfer of jurisdiction to the federal court.  But more important than that, at least for the purposes of this vlog, in the context of the lawsuit of the Chicago Police Department against Jussie Smollett, Jussie Smollett counterclaimed against the city and a bunch of other people for malicious prosecution.  And this on the basis that because the charges were ultimately dropped in exchange for Jussie Smollett's forfeiture of his $10,000 bond and two days community service, that he could therefore sue for malicious prosecution because he was never actually convicted of the crime?  That's the logic.  I've done videos on all of these issues, including Jussie Smollett's counterclaim for malicious prosecution, which I'm going to link right there because it contained a prediction which seems to have turned out to be relatively accurate.  Having read through and analyzed Jussie Smollett's counterclaim for malicious prosecution, it was relatively clear even to this ignorant Quebec attorney that it stood virtually no chance of success, so much so that it did not even survive a motion to dismiss.  And that is what brings us to today's vlog.  We are going to go through the judgment granting the motion to dismiss of Jussie Smollett's counterclaim for malicious prosecution beginning... now.  Memorandum, Opinion, and Order.  Now, we've already done a brief summary of the facts, so we'll just skip right through this.  The City of Chicago filed this lawsuit against Jussie Smollett seeking to recover costs incurred in connection with the Chicago Police Department's investigation of Smollett for allegedly filing a false police report stemming from a January 2019 attack.  Smollett filed a counterclaim against the City of Chicago, CPD Detective Michael Teers, CPD Detective Commander Edward Woodnicki, CPD Superintendent Eddie Johnson, and John and Jane Doe.  Defendants 1 through 10, Abimbola Osundaira and Olabinjo Osundaira.  Smollett alleges state law claims for malicious prosecution against all defendants and a malicious prosecution claim under 42 USC 1983 claim against the city defendants.  Defendants moved to dismiss Smollett's counterclaims for failing to state a claim under Rule 12-6B.  For the reasons discussed below, the defendants' motions to dismiss are granted.  Now, we have discussed motions to dismiss extensively in previous vlogs, most notably the Covington Catholic Kids saga.  We're going to go over it again in this judgment, but just to refresh your memory, a motion to dismiss under a Rule 12b-6 is a motion to dismiss on the basis that the party failed to state a claim, even assuming the allegations in their motion are true.  You will recall that in the Covington Catholic Nicholas Salmon defamation lawsuit, a motion to dismiss on a Rule 12b-6 was filed on the basis that even if Nicholas Salmon's allegations were true, it was not defamation because the statements were not of and about Nicholas Salmon, or the statements were matters of opinion, and therefore could not be defamatory.  So therefore, even assuming the allegations were true, the plaintiff had failed to state a claim in law.  And that is the very same motion to dismiss that we are facing right now, in that even if the allegations in Justice Mullet's counterclaim for malicious prosecution are true, he has failed to state a claim in law.  On a motion to dismiss under Rule 12 , the court accepts the complaint's well-pleaded factual allegations, with all reasonable inferences drawn in the non-moving party's favor, but not its legal conclusions.  The facts below are drawn from Smollett's amended counter-complaint and are accepted as true for the purposes reviewing this motion.  That's the standard and we spend the next five or six pages going over the facts, which we're only going to do summarily because we've already done them relatively thoroughly.  According to the amended counter-complaint, ",
