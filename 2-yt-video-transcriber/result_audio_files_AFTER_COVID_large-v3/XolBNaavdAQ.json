They don't test him for hormones.  Things are way different.  What do you mean?

You'd have to be a really, really, really rare person who doesn't take hormones and can perform like a 30-year-old when you're in your 50s.  But when you're on hormones... You can kind of do it.  There's a few guys that were in the UFC.  One of the bigger examples is Vitor Belfort.  Vitor Belfort, who's a phenomenal fighter, a real legend.  He won the first tournament that I ever worked on.  That was at UFC 12 in 1997.  So he was 19 years old back then.  And then when he was in his late 30s, he had a giant resurgence.  And it was when they made testosterone replacement therapy legal for fighters.  So there was a bunch of fighters that got on these testosterone replacement therapy exemptions.  So they're taking testosterone, but they had an old man's brain, but their body moved like a younger man.  So it's basically they had all of the experience of a lifetime of fighting, but because of the hormones, their body actually performed like someone way, way younger than them. ",

It depends on what kind of damage you're dealing with, what's wrong with you, whether or not it can bring you back 10 years or five years or who knows.  But with these fighters, the thing is they were never really out of shape.  And some of them, there's quite a few of them, in fact, and I'm not going to name any names, but some of them needed those hormones because they had done steroids.  So when you do steroids, it shuts down your endocrine system.  Your endocrine system doesn't make the proper hormones anymore.  And so they needed, it was a real weird sort of conundrum because everyone kind of knew this, but there was a weird loophole that went on for a few years.  It was a real gray area in MMA.  And so say a fighter could go to the doctor and say, hey, I want to get a blood test and see what my testosterone levels are because I am feeling very tired.  And they look at it and they test.  They go, oh, look at this.  Your testosterone levels are low.  You could take this hormone and inject it into your body every week.  Now you're eligible for testosterone replacement therapy.  But the thing is... They might have \u2013 like the whole reason why they needed it in the first place might have been that they were using it illegally.  So it's a weird thing you're rewarding because the testing wasn't very good.  And some of these guys that are a part of this \u2013 were a part of this testosterone replacement therapy thing, they were ones that were kind of accused of possibly using performance-enhancing drugs in the past.  So then they get to use them legally.  And Vitor, dude, I'm telling you, everyone in the MMA community would talk about TRT Vitor.  Because TRT Vitor was a guy who was in his 30s, he'd been fighting a long fucking time, but all of a sudden he was moving like a demon again and just smashing people.  You ever see him fight? ",
