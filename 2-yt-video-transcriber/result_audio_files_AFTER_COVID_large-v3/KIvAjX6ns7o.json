            "text": "Hello, friends.  Like many of you, I've been grieved and at times afraid as I've watched events unfold in our world in recent weeks.  In light of what is happening around the world because of COVID-19, we want to invite you to join us for a special day of fasting and prayer this Saturday, April 4th.  We want to pray to the Lord in faith, trusting what it says in passages like Psalm 1017.  O Lord, you hear the desire of the afflicted.  You will strengthen their heart.  You will incline your ear.  We envision this day of prayer and fasting having at least three parts.  First, a morning prayer.  We would like to encourage you to spend the morning in personal prayer.  We will provide a guide based on Psalm 27 to help you.  Second, a midday prayer.  We hope you will spend this time praying with others in your community, whether it's your family around the kitchen table, or maybe your church small group or friends on a video call.  Again, we'll provide a prayer guide for this midday prayer.  Last, an evening prayer.  On Saturday evening, we will gather online to pray together on TGC's Facebook page with believers from all across the world.  During this time, various brothers and sisters, pastors and ministry leaders, as well as musicians will guide this one-hour time of prayer.  We would love for you to join us.  This starts at 7 p.m.  Eastern, 4 p.m.  Pacific.  You can pray with us, share your own prayer requests, and pray for the requests of others in the comments section.  For more details on the plan for Saturday and to download the prayer guides our team created, visit tgc.org slash pray.  On behalf of the whole TGC family, we hope you'll join us this Saturday as we cry out to the Lord to provide healing and hope.  Thank you. ",
