            "text": "People tend to not really understand what the goal is if you medically transition but you're non-binary.  Hey there internet, my name's Alexander.  Today we're doing a transition update.  Side note before beginning, I got my new Fit2Me shirt.  That's not what this video is about though.  I will talk about it in a couple weeks, if you really want me to, to let you know what it's been like wearing it.  For background information, I was on T for two years.  a couple years ago, and then stopped for about two years, and then I started again in August.  And I have done some brief updates so far up here about what the changes were like at about like one and a half or two months, so now it's January, and it's been five months now, so I figured it's been enough time to let things happen and I have updates to let you know what it's like.  So, I am on what is supposed to be a very low dose.  I'm on 200 mg strength, and I'm doing it weekly at 0.25 ml, which is not very much.  So this is supposed to be a very low dose, and it's about half of the dose that I was on when I was originally on T a few years back.  One of the big differences this time is that the doctor's office is not three hours away, which means that I can get my levels checked on a regular basis, which you totally should do.  You probably should not be on hormones unless you're able to get your levels checked.  Anyway, so I'm on what is supposed to be a pretty low dose, and I got my levels checked in December.  Found out, actually, that my testosterone is within the average male range, so the lower end of that range is like 300-something, and the upper end of that range is 700-something, and I was in the 600s, so I'm on the higher end of within the average range for testosterone.  And apparently my estrogen is also within female range.  I didn't actually ask where it is within that spectrum though, so basically like my testosterone and my estrogen are both within the averages for what you would expect for each of the binary gender, sex, whatever's.  So that's weird, but I highly suspect that I have higher than average natal testosterone because I highly suspect that I have polycystic ovarian syndrome.  All right, so given that my estrogen and testosterone levels are where they are, I can talk about what has changed since the time that I last talked to you about hormones.  For the sake of my ability to keep track of what I'm talking about, I'm just gonna go, like, start up top here and work my way down.  My hair is starting to thin out up here a little bit.  I already had some change to my hairline before when I was on T for two years, but five months and I'm already noticing, especially along the sides here, that it's like just thin a little bit.  Like there's still hair there that I can grab, but you can't actually really see it.  I'm not like growing sideburns per se, but it seems to me like some of the like.  smaller hair is just sort of like encroaching like onto my face more.  like that.  Sorry, turning away from the microphone.  I've had a little bit of changes with my hairline.  so far as I can tell.  The quality of my skin hasn't changed drastically in terms of either texture or oil.  I get acne at about the same rate as I might otherwise.  It mostly depends on whether I am showering regularly and also whether I'm moisturizing after I shower, because sometimes If I shower, dry out my skin a bunch, don't moisturize, my skin over oils itself, and I'll get pimples like the day after I shower for whatever reason.  Other than that though, my skin quality, it's controllable.  Facial hair is one of the changes that's most noticeable and exciting for me.  probably not noticeable at all with a giant white light directly in my face on the camera.  I have an increasing thickening of my mustache hair.  I'm actually okay with not having a mustache.  It's like the least good part of facial hair, in my opinion.  But I am getting more hair on my chin which is definitely exciting.  I have- it depends on where my hair growth is at.  in terms of some of your hair grows at different times than other ones, so that you have like a stagger thing going on.  If I just let myself not shave for a few weeks, I just had winter break so I did go a couple weeks without shaving, I have probably like seven or eight dark black chin hairs that will grow and grow and grow and grow if I don't shave them, which looks bad.  But now I have like a smattering of blonde hairs that gradually, like, basically what happens when you're on T or if you're going through natal T puberty is that you have like all of these really fine hairs all over your body.  You probably know this already.  And what happens is that in these particular areas, it's still that thin, fine hair, but it starts to get longer.  And then, after it's longer and still very thin, it will thicken and become a blonde whisker, basically, and then from there it will get darker if it's going to get darker.  I've experienced this before. ",
