And I think in some ways that's \u2013 as I always say, in some ways that's actually really great and really calls for optimism.  In other ways it sucks when he facilitates various people.  But it's really \u2013 honestly, I'm not going to keep giving that disclaimer because we're at a point where it's honestly like \u2013 It's an is what it is thing now.  We're not even at that point anymore.  It is what it is.  And there's actually a lot to work with.  And I just want to say, this is Joe Rogan responding to because the democratic establishment can cry bully and gaslight you all day about the fact that joe biden is unable to do this physically and mentally.  but then it's going to go into a general election and i know the democratic elites don't care about it because all they care about is beating sanders.  four more years of trump is great for them bonanza fundraising but you care about beating trump because you know how horrifying this all is.  check out how this resonates with a bernie sanders supporter person who's not going to be obscured by a whole bunch of bullshit and propaganda, smart guy who can see what is right in front of his face and represents a lot of voters.

This is not saying, in fact, part of the reason that we actually eased up on this was out of human compassion.  It was actually saying it is really sad and unpleasant to watch somebody, even somebody that I think has a terrible political career, diminish.  And I'll make some jokes about it, because I'll make jokes about anything, but actually this is very sad.  It's very uncomfortable.  But it is what it is.  And if you go out and you try to lie to normal people and use a whole bunch of bullshit fucking rhetoric about what's right in front of their face, it's going to be doubly insulting.
