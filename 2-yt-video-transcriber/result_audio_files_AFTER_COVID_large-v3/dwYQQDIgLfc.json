            "text": "So this is the Simi Valley Police Department.  This is for you, Cali girl.  We have to walk between the city hall and all that.  to get to the other side, I believe.  We've never been here, so we're not sure what we're walking into.  Stay safe.  How you guys doing?  Good.  What you up to?  Just filming the station.  Why?  Just doing a little story.  The station?  What kind of story?  I like stories.  I can't say nothing because it's not published yet.  Huh?  I can't say nothing because it's not published yet.  Oh.  Is it for like a magazine or movies or what?  I don't know yet.  Depends on who picks it up.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  I was trying to get somebody to like drive it in and out without stopping.  Who's your friend?  Just a friend of mine.  Part of the movies too?  He doesn't talk or what?  I'm not sure.  You're not sure if he talks?  He talks to me.  Do you know him?  Huh?  Do you know him?  I'm not going to answer any questions.  Oh, all right.  Do you have any ID?  For what?  Just get to know you.  Oh, can I see your ID?  Yeah.  It's Officer Stringer.  No, no, no.  Your ID, where you live.  Where I live?  Yeah.  Why do you want to know where I live?  Why would you want to know where I live?  I didn't ask where you live.  I asked where your name was.  Oh, I don't think I have to give that up.  No, you don't.  I'm just wondering... If you wanted to or not?  Oh, no.  Because most people are usually pretty friendly with us, and they're like, oh, yeah, my name's Joe.  Hey, I'm David.  I don't give my name out to just strangers, anybody.  I'm not a stranger.  Oh, yes, Joe, I don't know you.  I'm Officer Stringer.  Yeah, but I don't know your background.  I mean, there's a lot of stuff going around.  I mean, I just, yeah.  It's not because you're on probation or anything, right?  I don't answer questions.  Well, if you're on probation, you have to.  I don't answer questions.  All right.  You understand?  I thought it was a friendly... I thought it was a friendly... See how it turns into.  you're trying to get me for something?  You're dismissed.  You can go now.  We're done with this.  You're dismissed.  Thank you.  All I asked you was what's your name?  You're dismissed.  Thank you.  You guys always got to be rude and intrusive.  This is a First Amendment... Asking someone what your name is is rude.  For my ID, sir?  Who are you that I would have to give you my ID?  And why would I want you, with all this stuff, all the police killing civilians, why would I want to give you my name so you can retaliate?  No, thank you.  Listen.  No, I don't have to listen.  Thank you.  You have a good day.  No, you're dismissed, both of you guys.  You're dismissed.  No, you're dismissed.  You work for us.  I don't work for you.  I work for you?  Yes, sir.  You're a public servant, right?  I do.  I work for everyone here.  That's right.  We pay taxes, so you work for us.  I don't follow.  Yeah, well, we don't follow orders from you, sir.  In this case, I'm not ordering you to do anything.  Well, it's just.  why would you ask me for ID?  It's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just rude.  It's just rude.  It's just rude, man.  I didn't say you had to.  And why did you ask me if you're on probation?  Your whole point of stopping, listen, your whole point of stopping.  Exactly.  Your whole point of stopping everybody is to see what you could put them in jail for.  You know what?  You're dismissed because you're not going to put us in jail because you don't have the right to even ask me for ID as far as legally.  You shouldn't even be stopping me, stopping and bothering me when I'm doing a First Amendment protected activity.  Do you know Fordyce versus Seattle?  Do you know California Code 148.G?  No.  You can go, sir.  Thank you.  We would like to be left alone, sir.  Respect our wishes.  Thank you, sir.  You have a good day.  Well, you're not paid to stand around, sir.  How much do you make a year, sir?  Are you saying that to your residents in this city, that you're allowed to just stand here and bother people that are conducting a total lawful activity?  You're fine to stand there as long as you want to.  No, no, no.  I asked you a question.  Are you telling me that you're going to waste taxpayers' money by standing there harassing and bothering people that are doing nothing illegal?  Just answer that question.  What's harassing you about?  Trying to find out my information?  I don't know.  I don't know you.  I don't know you if you're a corrupt police officer or not.  Why would I give you my name?  Hey, what's your name, officer?  No, no.  Let me see your ID where you live.  Why would I do that?  Exactly.  Why would I do that with you?  We're both men, right?  We're both men, right?  We are.  Yeah, but you didn't ask in the way that he said it, and then he moved on to probation.  Why?  What is your reasonable, articulate suspicion for asking that?  You're bothering us.  I've already said a couple of times, if you guys can leave us alone so we can continue with our project, and you won't leave us alone.  Now you're harassing us.  We're asking you... Here's a double standard, guys.  I can stand here.  You can stand here.  You're getting paid, sir, not to stand here.  You're getting paid.  Are all the crimes solved around here that you can just stand here and not do nothing?  It's shameful that you're getting paid so much money and you're going to try to sit there and do a pissing contest with somebody that's not doing nothing illegal.  Excuse me.  And you're willing to waste taxpayers' money and just stand there with your arms crossed and serve who?  You're not serving anybody right now, sir.  All I did was try and get to know who you are.  Okay, I'm going to stop talking to you, and I'm going to call you out of your bullshit, and please leave us alone.  What's your name and badge number, sir?  Officer Stratton.  What's your badge number, 37?  461.  What's your name and badge number, please?  Officer Stringer, 113.  Can you please leave us alone now?  I've never kept you from doing anything.  You're more than welcome to do whatever you like.  Okay, but we don't want to be interrogated, sir.  We're not interrogating you.  Because you can't, because we're not doing anything illegal.  And that's why, that's the only thing holding you, you realize that the law is the only thing holding you back from you imposing your will right now?  Because you know we're not doing nothing illegal, so why would you pry into my privacy and ask me if I'm not doing anything illegal?  He asked me if I'm on parole.  That's an insult.  Why would he assume that I'm on parole?  Why?  Why?  Why?  Your safety?  You shouldn't be a cop if you're that much of a scaredy cat, sir.  We want to be left alone, please.  We're asking you nice.  We're not detaining you.  You guys are more than free to be.  We just want to be left alone.  We'll let you carry on.  Thank you.  Jeez, is that so hard?  Why is it on your own probation or parole, like insulting us like we're some kind of criminals or something?  We just want to be left alone.  He said he doesn't know who we are.  I'm scared of him.  He's got no reason to be scared of me.  We've had an eventful day, guys.  I don't know if you guys saw the broadcast earlier, but we got our hands put on again and California Guardian got thrown to the floor.  All right.  Have a good day, guys.  Was that so hard, sir?  Oh, it's Sergeant.  Set him straight.  Thank you, Sergeant. ",
