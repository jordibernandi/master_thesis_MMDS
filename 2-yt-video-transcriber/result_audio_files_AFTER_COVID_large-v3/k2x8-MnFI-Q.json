Stick around and we'll share some of our favorite moments from that special just a little bit later.  But first, let's take a look at some of the best of the best from the first 100 episodes of The Carlos Watson Show.  Got to tell you, I think we've had a little bit of fun here. ",

We haven't been around any other human beings aside from our immediate house.  I have become calmer in some ways, more anxious and frantic in others, because I'm scared about what's happening to other people in the world.

Never back down.  Never apologize when you're not wrong.  Just stand firm in your beliefs, whatever those beliefs may be.  I just had to just step out and just say, you know what, I'm just going to put one foot in front of the other and I'm just going to start making moves and making decisions and learning and and researching and asking people and just do whatever I could do to just not be stagnant in one space.  It requires safe space to do so.  And it was sort of a big lesson for me.  Okay, as long as you keep at it, you can achieve your goals and dreams.  But you have to dig deeper for reasons to celebrate not just who you are, but appreciate how you're different.  Do all you can to associate yourself with people or businesses or whatever your dream is to make sure that you can achieve that.  Go in even if you know for a fact that you don't know what you're doing.  It doesn't matter.  Go in knowing that you have a dream to achieve, you have a goal to achieve, and you're willing to learn.

Let's slow down and look and include other voices and other people into this movement.  First of all, black lives do matter.  The murder of young black men is a travesty.  Guys are mad because you're saying we don't just have a few bad apples, that we have bushels of apples.  And I said, well, it's the truth.  Now we go into solution mode.  Yes, we did terrible things.  And now we have to figure out how every single day you're going to fix them.  To my mind, all that matters is that the society, the fundamental structure of the society, be fair.  Voter suppression, redlining.  reparations legacies of jim crow uh employment opportunity i could go on.  i see the power of the people.  um and it's going to be the power of the people that elongates that conversation.  so justice and storytelling really goes hand in hand because so much of what we're hearing are stories that were told.  and the question is what do you believe?  what is the truth?  you know i'm not in the.  you know making laws for black people or legislation or how everybody should live that I really don't believe in.  that, you know what I mean?  I believe that the promise of what we're fighting for is for everybody to have the maximum amount of responsible choice as possible.  While we've seen terrible injustices exposed, we've also seen the way that the world has responded.  And by that, I don't mean politicians, but I feel as though the people have changed.  Our collective consciousness has shifted.  And when I come through the door, if I don't see real representation at this table, that this proverbial table y'all keep talking about, I'm cool to leave and build my own house that's full of a bunch of tables and chairs.  I need to stand behind my words and bring action to those words that I was vocal about and creating change and still, you know, representing that. ",

A relationship is a work after the honeymoon phase.  You know, it's just great.  It always lights up a room.  It always lights me up.  When I met her, I felt like I knew her my whole life.

We're back talking about the American dream and how attainable it is for people of color.  But it's not up to just us to affect honest change.  I think we can all agree that allies are needed in every corner.  In the summer of 2020, millions took to the streets to call for criminal justice reform and racial equality.
