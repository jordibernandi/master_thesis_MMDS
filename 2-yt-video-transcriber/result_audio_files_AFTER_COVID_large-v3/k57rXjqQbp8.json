It just didn't sound like any politician I'd ever heard before.  I thought I'd be a Republican all of my life, but Donald J. Trump has broken my faith.  in the Republican Party.  My problem with him is that he lies.  Donald Trump is a pathological liar.  He's not a conservative.  His spending, his deficit.  His mishandling of the coronavirus.  He belittles those who disagree with him.  He calls them names like a middle school child.  I'm tired of being embarrassed.  I have been riddled with guilt.  I am ashamed to this day for voting for him.  We've had enough.  Voting for Donald Trump has been a monumental mistake.  I'll take anybody over him.  I'm voting for Joe Biden.  Joe Biden.  Donald Trump has to go.  It's okay to change your mind.  We did.  Defending democracy together is responsible for the content of this ad. ",
