            "text": "Britain wouldn't be Britain without refugees.  Britain wouldn't be Britain without invaders, Gary.  Sure enough, a lot of us came here as refugees, but this rather pales in comparison to those of us descended from settling peoples or invading peoples.  The Celts and then the Romans and then the Anglo-Saxons and indeed whoever came before or after or threaded throughout, such as the many Vikings.  Vikings!  Vikings!  You're not allowed in here.  He'll get letters.  How did you even get out of here?  Go!  Go!  Right, Gary, so when you say Britain wouldn't be Britain without X, if your argument is this is how it has always been, therefore this is how we should always go on, I must say I didn't have you pegged as such a conservative, but you do you.  Nevertheless, you must concede by that logic that we as a nation need to go on being British.  invaded.  Oh you already basically do believe that?  That's what you're contractually told to believe.  Good skills Gary.  Britain wouldn't be Britain without fish and chips.  Yes it would.  Gary look around you.  Nowadays we mostly eat kebabs and curries and pizzas and burgers and it's still Britain.  It's still no less British because being British never had anything to do with the menus.  Yes, that is why they are giggling up at the back there, I see you.  You'll all be aware of the stereotype.  Whatever feats of engineering for which the British are infamous, our culinary efforts are not among them.  Which is hardly surprising, since nothing grows here natively except turnips, brambleberries and a mysterious triangle of rhubarb.  The Cornish pasties and the Eccles cakes have become somewhat quaint in comparison to the smorgasbord on display nowadays.  But to repeat, Britain is no less British for having fancier menus.  Because even the good people who prepare and serve those exotic, worldly foodstuffs from their British kitchens... As they enrich our culture, they enjoy and appreciate the British way of life in which they live, and the British things in it.  Such as football.  I've worked in the bluest of blue-collar jobs, Gary.  And in London, no less.  A Royal Mail sorting office is like a Benetton advert.  I mean, any given depot.  It's a triple rainbow across the continents.  Some of them... speak pidgin English at best, and some of them you would not know from Darren to listen to them.  But what they all have in common, Gary, is their love of and passion for the beautiful game.  The beautiful game that the British people invented and gifted to the world as its favourite sport by far.  Personally, I don't like it, if I'm honest.  I tried it When I was a lad at school at break time, jumpers for goalposts, let's not get into it.  But it wasn't my thing, football.  It was obvious early on that it wasn't my thing.  But I couldn't possibly bring myself to resent those who love it, because they really love it.  People love football as much as I could love any earthly pursuit.  And I have been in those Royal Mail depots.  I've seen men and many women.  from every nation on this earth come together and make the dullest of days brighter through their love of the beautiful game that this beautiful nation created.  When are you going to turn on that, Gary?  Eh?  Football.  Eton football, to give it its full name.  How was that brought over to Britain?  Was it invented by some disabled Turk as a means of kicking inflated care packages across an occupied gulf?  were trains invented by a lowly Marxist child in India who just wanted options when escaping from a war zone.  And he was trans, and that's why we call them trains.  When will that childishly fae joke I just told become legislative reality, Gary?  What about rhubarb?  Huh?  Did we steal all the rhubarb?  Why would we do that?  I'm sorry, I'm several pages ahead of myself and also behind, and I forgot the intro.  Oi Gary, have you ever thought about where I actually come from?  The sea is where we used to be able to get all the fish we needed before the EU put a stop to that.  You've got refugees to thank for me.  And refugees have got us to thank for all the free food.  Would you say we've sufficiently thanked each other now?  Can we perhaps draw a line somewhere?  You guys catch the fish, because we're not allowed to, you guys sell us the fish for approximately stupid pounds 99, and then you take up a dinghy full of illegal immigrants like a skipping stone, Hoy across the channel where upon hordes of disgruntled criminals drag their COVID riddled farm shoes up the road and snuggle up in a complimentary four star hotel where for free of charge we'll serve them the piping hot fish we just bought from you for six monkeys and a stupid.  We've certainly come a long way from give a man a fucking fish.  I must say, I can't quite recall where in this process we have any bastard to thank for anything, but have we done enough yet?  With all these safety nets, we're webbing across everything.  Have we done enough to say thank you for your ingenious decision to put batter on fish?  Don't get me wrong, brilliant idea.  We never would have thought of that.  We'd have just kept on boiling it in the bag forever.  I guess some other time we'll discuss the idea of, for instance, oh, I don't know, putting electricity in computing machines.  That sort of thing's just a quaint novelty.  Something you only ever order once every three years when you've forgotten what it tastes like.  But it's the giving you all of the above for free that I'm talking about.  When do we get gratitude?  from the economic tourists, I mean refugees, for this extremely generous hospitality of ours.  Thank you for telling us to revere those unlike us, but doing it both ways would be nice.  Where are the national commercials saying, hey, refugees, you know where that hotel came from?  You know where all these services you're taking advantage of are coming from?  Believe it or not, it's the British people.  It's the ongoing labour of British people of all races keeping your ass floating on central heated sofas.  So without British people, refugees wouldn't be refugees.  They'd just be wandering into yet another fucking war zone from which they'd have to escape again.  Maybe, just maybe, you have the British people to thank for the comfort and security you're currently enjoying.  And the leniently overlooked crimes you keep getting away with.  No?  That would be xenophobic.  Okay.  Thank fuck you guys aren't cunts.  Thank fuck all the fucks.  This isn't just a cunty bunch of fucks cunting about.  Well, as it happens, I'm a bit Spanish, a bit Portuguese.  16th century Jewish refugees brought me over.  OK.  Thank you, Spain.  Thank you, Portugal.  Feel free to keep sending us all those Spanish and Portuguese refugees that you have.  What is your actual point, please?  And I've never heard any British people complaining about Jewish immigrants, except for one particular demographic of British people.  Maybe we should ask those guys to leave, but, hey, we like the kebabs too.  OK.  No, no, no, no.  Funny story, actually.  Kebabs were not actually invented by kebabs.  Are you Ronnie Corbett?  No, no, no, I'm dead.  He's dead.  Why would Ronnie Corbett be a cabal?  So it's not racist.  Fair enough.  Call that a history.  We came over with French refugees.  Protestants, I believe.  You know what, mate?  Don't bring Tommy Cooper into this.  I'm from fucking America.  Everyone knows that.  No, that is awful.  Never do that again.  It's a good point, though.  The awful advice just made.  Surely we all have to thank Sir Walter Raleigh.  for whatsoever we may do with potatoes.  Some crafty Spaniard probably got there first, but such is the point I'm making.  Were it not for the competitive imperialism of the European empires, were it not for their drive for far-reaching colonialism, particularly in the Americas, then the French would not have their potatoes, the Italians would not have their tomatoes, and the Belgians would not have their chocolates.  No one would have any of these things except the isolated tribes of Native Americans who have no idea what to do with them.  They'd still be eating maize and we'd probably still be eating turnips.  It is not just the creators and the consumers that make the world go round.  We have the movers to thank for most, if not all of this.  The couriers, the deliverers, the people who bring the creations to the consumers.  They are arguably the most thankable part of the process.  Especially when the creator is just Mother Nature.  And so is the consumer, come to think of it.  You can thank Mother Nature all you like, she's not going to hear you, she's not going to care, and she's not going to change unless she feels like it.  Do you know where apples come from?  I mean, natively, originally, way back when.  Kazakhstan.  Kazakhstan.  Believe it or not.  And it was way back when, as in before the political nation of Kazakhstan was even a glint in the syphilitic milkman's eye.  Do we have Kazakhstan to thank for bringing us apples?  Do we have the physical terrain of that area and the people who lived there thousands of years ago to thank for bringing us apples?  No.  We have the enterprising greengrocers to thank, the merchants, the tradesmen, the businessmen who stacked those motherfuckers in the back of a donkey cart and literally brought us the apples from ancient non-Kazakhstan to the next ancient whatever-istan until they met in the middle and tied the bridge with the merchants on the road to Europe and indeed Britain, where these glorious apples will gloriously grow anywhere thanks to nature's wildly unpredictable generosity.  So race aside, ethnicity aside, even culture aside, who or what do we have to thank for?  the miracle of having apples hanging proudly and plumply from trees, thriving season to season in any given garden in any temperate zone?  My libertarian friends are nine steps ahead of me already.  The catalyst that makes this happen, the bees who build the flower gardens of your earthly paradise and the strange semi-nomadic, semi-tribal, bipedal mammals who literally carried those apples from Kazakhstan to your home are the agents of the free market.  And that is who I will be thanking this day.  Mr.  Lineker, that is who I will be thanking each and every day.  Until I receive the slightest hint that you cummy fuckknuckles can even hold a candle to it.  I said good day.  Settled in the East End after we were chased out of France.  French fries, we get it.  And fried fish, we get it.  Do you know, I think what we're honing in on here is not so much a dish, not even an ingredient, but a method of frying.  Are we doing nothing more than simply trying to track down the inventor of the deep fat fryer?  Because I don't think he was even a fucking Syrian.  Let alone a North African, do you get me?  Even in this god-awful attempt to yank at whatever heartstrings you could grab with your tentacles, all you can latch onto is France, Spain, Portugal, and Jews of no fixed abode.  And this is clearly a question nobody asked.  The question we're asking is what's the fucking point in all the digging muppets?  What are they bringing us that we haven't tried yet?  Goat's head curry?  Fish head stew?  Severed head of infidel au vin?  We wouldn't mind some Portuguese immigrants.  We wouldn't mind some Jewish immigrants.  It's not like there's many of them to even go around.  And I think I speak for many of us when I say we would welcome with open arms Hong Kong immigrants.  And not because of the wondrous things they can do with noodles, but because they have a track record that suggests they can be trusted to integrate to Britishness and not to racial collectivism.  Nationalism may be imperfect, but it is infinitely preferable to racism.  Yes, they are very different things.  Well, I never.  Do you remember the 90s, Gary?  I remember.  When you would advertise chopped up pieces of fried potato because you wanted the money.  How ironic is it that you're still doing it?  Now you're the richest punter on the BBC, where it's my understanding that they don't take kindly to presenters doing commercials, but apparently it's perfectly okay if the thing you're advertising is the cluster of shady NGOs on the Calais coast illegally trafficking humans.  Was this supposed to make kids understand?  Was that the point of the googly-eyed cartoons?  Say thank you to all the illegal immigrants, kids.  Everyone is allowed in.  COVID doesn't matter.  By the way, none of you are allowed to leave because COVID matters.  When do we get to call ourselves refugees?  Given how comprehensively our human rights are being refused.  Live with yourself, Lineker.  That is an order.  I don't know how you do it, just get there.  I'm done, y'all.  I can't freaking believe I got 12 minutes out of this.  Crikey, oh shit-ass.  Maybe this is that hard work I promised you I'd do at some point.  Maybe not, eh?  We'll see when I see you later.  Fuck writer.  Fuck an onion writer.  Thank you. ",
