            "text": "Hello Scaredy Cats, it's me, Scaredy Matt.  And I'm free!  No more gimmicks, no more seasonable shenanigans, I can talk about anything I want.  Which makes it doubly weird that I chose the topic I picked today, the surreal horror of R slash I'm Sorry John and, like, Lovecraftian horror Garfield in general.  Now I hesitate to talk about this.  On my other channel, I made a video that was tangentially related to Garfield, and ever since, I've been sent every single bit of Garfield news, trivia, or, most upsettingly, pornography imaginable.  A patron paid me to draw Garfield's feet.  So let me just state this for the record.  While once I simply did not care about Garfield, I now loathe him.  Garfield has worn out his welcome with me.  I do not like or care about Garfield.  Please do not feel the need to keep me abreast of the latest Garfield happenings.  I do not care about lasagna or Mondays.  That being said, What is it I wanted to talk about?  Some kind of spooky Garfield?  I'm sorry, John, it's a collection of fan creations collected on a subreddit of the same name, which portray Garfield as a creeping existential horror or something, which has gradually grown corrupted and dangerous.  John is often portrayed as hiding from the terror he has wrought.  But sometimes, he's presented as a counterbalance, a holy force to counter Garfield's malevolent influence.  And I know that this sounds so wildly specific, like, that can't be a thing, right?  It's not a thing, is it?  And I assure you, it's a whole thing.  The name I'm Sorry John comes from a comic created in 2013 by the artist Double Baby.  a man wakes up in the middle of the night.  some kind of pattern surrounds his wall.  he turns on the lamp on his night-table only to find that the pattern has spread itself over everything engulfing his whole home and all of his furniture.  he heads downstairs with a flashlight.  Gradually he makes his way to the kitchen, where he sees something, something which terrifies him.  I'm sorry, John, says a shaky, inhuman voice from off-screen.  We see it now.  Garfield's face spread over the wall, his flesh spreading out in all directions.  I was so hungry, says the creature that was once Garfield.  You've probably seen it before.  It's a classic for a reason.  It takes a very funny idea and executes it in a genuinely kind of upsetting way.  The line work, expressive characters, and tension building up to one splash panel evokes the work of mangaka horror master Junji Ito who, yes, I'll talk about more someday.  Don't worry.  It is by far the most requested topic I have for this channel.  But, like... The thing is, though, the thing about it is that it's Garfield.  So you can't really be scared.  It's funny because it is Garfield.  And weirdly, the joke just doesn't stop working.  Like, you can go as far over the top as you want and it's always funny to imagine this mass-marketed orange cat as some kind of horrific, unknowable being.  It's exactly the type of image that the people who manage Garfield's brand would want to avoid.  Seeing these things get popular, you can almost imagine some Viacom marketing executive feverishly trying to think of a way to explain to shareholders why the critical 12 to 25 demo that they want to target views the cuddly orange cat as a world-ending monster, and in a way, He kind of is.  I mean, the commercialization that Garfield represents is destructive, all-consuming, trying to affect infinite growth.  He's so hungry.  There is a certain degree of truth to this joke, because whether or not we like to admit it, Garfield and all the other corporate mascots like him are kind of sinister, like they're designed to trick you into buying stuff, and to appeal to children, and to trick them into buying stuff.  And there can be no real art to something like Garfield anymore.  Sure, there might have been at one point, but over the years, any aspect of creativity or personality has been gradually shorn away by PR experts and branding consultants until all that remains is an empty shell.  Something that used to be a gag-a-day comic, slightly acerbic, something to make you laugh, bring you a little bit of fun, to entertain you.  Now it only exists to sell merchandise, to take from you, and grow stronger. ",
