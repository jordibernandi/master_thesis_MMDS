            "text": "Thanks for calling.  Don't Hassle Us Local.  Who do I have on the line?  Hey, it's Murky calling.  What's up?  What's up, buddy?  Hi.  Yeah, well, there's more than one person there.  Yeah, yeah, we've got four in the studio.  That's exciting.  People are going to love that.  I'm calling in.  I do the cold opens for the Not Even a Show.  Stoop did it for a while.  There's been a couple other people.  Kyle was in there for a bit, but I'm sort of the go-to guy, the main guy who does the cold opens.  The cold opens?  For what show is that?  Yeah.  Well, it's not even a show.  That's the thing.  And it gets kind of confusing in that way.  But basically, we're in it right now.  You guys are doing it with me right now.  We're having a good time.  Oh, sweet.  Yeah.  I just basically need you guys to say, let's start the show.  And then everyone goes crazy.  crazy we have to go crazy.  or we just say let's start the show.  no you guys just say let's start the show.  if you could say it in unison that would be absolutely insane.  but people will go crazy from not even a show if you just hit them with a. let's start the show.  alright.  should we do it guys 3 2 1. let's start the show celebrate good times.  come on.  It's a celebration.  Oh, my God.  That's the best one that anyone has ever done.  I love you.  Bye.  Jay.  I have no clue.  What is this?  Time out.  What number was that from?  Was that an Iowa Eric?  Was that a prank call?  I think so.  Because if it wasn't, I'd be even more disappointed.  Either way.  That was great.  Good times.  Good times.  Sorry if you thought it so, but this is not even a show.  It's NEAS Saturday night!  Folks, there's a new kid in town.  SNL is going down.  There's no need to give us thanks.  Just tune in and watch the pranks.  Yeah, one call, a two call, a three call, four.  Just when you think we're finished, then we call once more.  You're in a little battle and we're fighting a war.  How can you stop the pranks when the pranks are to the core?  It's NEAS Saturday, Saturday night, yeah.  Musical guest, Nirvana covering David Bowie.  And your host, Jonathan Taylor Thomas.  Hey everybody, welcome to the NEAS election special.  I'm your host, Jonathan Taylor Thomas.  And I know last week my good friend Brian Luttrell did a fantastic job hosting, but I'm hoping that I can make it a home improvement this week.  Just kidding.  But seriously though, I hope that my good looks don't make anyone too randy.  That's the name of the character that I played on Home Improvement.  But in all seriousness, this is a great election special that we have for you.  Obviously, all of these calls were made before the results were known.  We just found out the results.  Joseph Biden is the president.  But all of these calls were made on Election Day, and there's some great ones.  We've got calls to Dennis Prager, Brian Kilmeade, J.J.  McCartney, and ESPN Radio.  First, though, Rudy Giuliani has spent the week embarrassing himself publicly, but he also has a radio show, and he also, more importantly, and we want you to never forget this, he married and had sex with his cousin.  Check it out.  So now we'll go to Will in the swing state of Florida.  Hey, Will.  Hello, Mayor.  How are you today?  How are you, Will?  I'm great.  It's so great to speak to you on such a historic day, sir.  It is a historic day.  This day actually determined the future of our country for the next 40 years.  And as Sidney Powell, who is here with me, says, the future of the world.  Yeah, truly.  And I know that you obviously voted for Mr.  Trump.  But I was just reading a Biden campaign promise, and I thought it might be something that actually interests you.  Yeah, what did Biden promise?  He probably changed it four or five times, but tell me what it was.  Well, he said if he's elected, that he'll make it legal to marry your cousin.  I've been looking for freedom.  I've been looking so long.  Oh, you know you're a jackass, right?  You really are.  You really are a jackass.  What about having sex with your sister-in-law?  What about that?  Is it going to make that legal?  Or how about smoking enormous amounts of crack?  You have one hell of a nerve coming after me on that when Hunter Biden got into this massive love affair with his sister-in-law.  I was New York's mayor When the towers fell I went on the TV.  I did it pretty well Which came as a surprise Cause.  when you look into my eyes You can tell how dumb I am And how little that I know.  I'm so dumb In fact That I never check the docs And so now I am Just a man who fucked his cousin.  Brian Kilmeade is one of these media guys that's surely going to try to pretend like he wasn't a big Trump sycophant, but we will never forget.  This week, though, we called him on Election Day and we hit him with an old classic, and you're going to love it.  Check it out.  Thanks for having me here in Jersey.  All right.  So I'll take some calls.  1-866-408-7669.  Let's go to Jason listening online as we release the simulcast on FBN.  You're in Idaho, eh, Jason?  Hey, Brian.  Thank you for taking my call.  I'm excited today as you guys are.  I'll admit a little bit nervous, obviously.  Are you a little bit nervous?  I mean, definitely.  I've never seen a common event.  Well, the pandemic is the other one.  If I bring up the pandemic, every person you talk to has a personal, some tribulations they've been through.  When you bring up the election, everyone deals with it differently.  I agree.  I got to say, I voted Democrat in 26.  I voted Democrat my whole life.  I've only voted in four presidential elections, but I voted Democrat every year.  2016, voted Democrat.  But something happened in the interim.  A massive event in my life really changed my outlook and brought me around to the Trump, the Republicans, and I will be voting Trump.  A huge, big, life-changing thing happened.  What happened?  I was kicked in the head by a horse.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I hope you refer back.  So Jason in Idaho was kicked in the head.  I hope he feels better.  Andy W. D. B. O. In.  In Florida.  Hey, Andy.  Hi.  Yeah.  Long time.  Kill me.  Listener.  And I am living in the I-4 corridor and I'm.  pretty certain that Florida is going to go Trump's way big time, a lot bigger than they say.  My question is, how come nobody's been monitoring California as much?  They're also sure it's going to go Democrat.  I have a prediction that it may very well go Trump's way.  No, I don't think so.  In fact, Andy, I know they showed up in Newport.  I know they show up in different places.  He's appeared for fundraisers.  But The problem in California, they say not only, Andy, might you be off on that prediction, they say he might lose by a record amount.  Dennis Prager is an old, boring fucking loser who hopefully just fades away now that Trump is gone, although I feel like maybe he won't.  The good news is as long as he's on the air, we'll continue to call him and confront him about allegations that he wears and soils a diaper.  Check it out.  Let me take some calls, my friends.  Let's go to Scranton, Pennsylvania, the theoretical home of one of the candidates.  Hi.  Hi.  Hello, Nathan.  Hey, Dennis.  Can I thank you for real?  I was an undecided voter for much of the lead-up to the election, but I was very much swayed by the PragerU YouTube videos, which led me to vote for you to stop crapping in your diapers.  All righty, everybody, and let's go to Andrea in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  Hi.  Hi, how are you?  Hello, Andrea in Pittsburgh.  Yes, hi.  Okay, we're having a technical problem here.  Can you hear me?  Okay.  Okay.  Can I talk to Andrea in Pittsburgh, please?  All right.  What are you going to do?  Ryan in Portland, Oregon.  Hello.  Hey, Dennis.  I just got finished voting, and I am proud of my vote this year.  And I have no problem telling the whole world that I voted for you to stop pausing for 20 seconds on your live radio show.  See, this is the left.  All right.  Austin in Palm Desert, California.  Hello.  Yes, indeed.  Hi.  Hey, how's it going?  So I was just thinking, you know, worst case scenario, if Trump loses, what do you think is going to be the future of the sort of conservative movement?  I actually think it will be very robust and it is almost entirely due to Trump.  Trump has given conservatives testicles.  And this is the first time in my life.  What did I always say?  Oh, yes, I said we're in a civil war, but only one side is fighting.  I've been saying that for decades.  Now we're in a civil war, and both sides are fighting.  That's thanks to Trump.  I've been fighting my whole life, but I wasn't the president.  Well, you know, and he's kind of changed my mind over the last four years, too.  Like, I voted Democrat in 2016, and You know, I didn't think Trump was fit for office, but I can say for certain now that after four years that you wear a diaper and fill up twice.  And let's go to Colorado Springs and Michael.  Hello, Michael.  Dennis Prager.  The tailgater is a sports fan who loves drinking alcohol, and he's been accused in the past of not really knowing a lot about sports, which is why he used this coronavirus quarantine to educate himself and become the greatest ever trivia man since Schwab.  Let's see if anybody's impressed.  Check it out.  Is this just Gator?  Is that right?  Okay.  All right, Gator, go, go, go.  Hey, how's it going?  Thanks for taking my call, brother.  Mm-hmm.  My name is Tailgater.  They call me Gator for short, but short for Tailgater.  I'm kind of a well-known caller to these radio shows.  The song will actually play now.  It just played.  But I actually know everything about college football, and I can answer any question.  I know all the trivia.  Anything you could ever ask me or throw at me, I can answer it.  Okay.  And that is okay.  Now what?  Well, you're supposed to ask me trivia.  No, I'm not supposed to ask that.  I'm supposed to take calls and talk sports, not judge your trivia knowledge.  But I know it's about sports.  My trivia knowledge is about sports.  I know everything about sports.  Good.  Congratulations.  I thought your listeners would be impressed.  I doubt it.  But don't they love sports?  Well, they might like sports, but they don't want to.  maybe hear you pontificate about how good you are.  Well, have you ever heard of the show Stump the Schwab?  It was a famous show on television.  World famous.  World famous.  I don't know how I missed it.  Well, why are you getting so mad at me?  I'm not mad.  I'm not mad that you're taking it wrong.  But I'm not going to waste time asking you trivia questions.  We're here to discuss sports.  I'm a beloved character.  People love me.  I am so glad you're beloved.  Maybe there'll be a shrine after you someday.  But thank you for your call.  Here's a trivia question.  When will the next time he gets on the show?  Answer that trivia question.  It's been quite some time since we've really gotten JJ.  And that's because he tends to take calls off the air and tries to see if it's a prank or not.  And it really makes his show terrible, but it also stops us from getting any real good pranks on the air.  That is until this week.  Our friend Morgan absolutely destroyed the man.  Check it out.  Rocking better shirts than you.  Loving the JJ crew.  Donald Trump's leadership has changed the game, my friends.  It has changed the game.  It really does.  Really has.  It really does.  Now, I believe we have Morgan on the phone.  Morgan.  Hello, where are you calling from?  Hello, Morgan.  You're calling from Texas?  Hi, how are you, Morgan?  Good to have you on the show.  Hey, I'm good.  I don't call often into shows, but I've just been listening for a while, and today's been a big day.  I thought I'd call you and share something that happened to me at the polling station this morning.  Okay, go ahead.  Okay, cool.  Yeah, well, I'm a registered voter and I showed up at the correct polling station and they wouldn't let me twice my vote.  The only explanation they could give me was you can't come in here because you're not wearing a shirt.  Oh, Morgan, boy, you know, I'm sorry for you.  I really am.  Apologies to your parents.  And ladies and gentlemen, you see the... A typical Democrat voter.  And they wouldn't let her vote because she wasn't wearing a shirt.  Ooh, boy, you're sharp.  You are some kind of sharp.  Ladies and gentlemen.  Can you imagine if you had a child that was so... Stupid?  Can I say stupid?  Morgan, I don't mean to call you names, but let's face it, you're just a moron.  You're a stupid moron, and I don't like the fact that you were manipulatable.  Yes, you were manipulated into making that call.  You know you were.  And we all know who's driving that process.  It's, you know, it's all coming from north of the border, okay?  Maybe someday the USMCA can be altered so that people like you-know-who in Canada are no longer allowed to use telephone devices for any reason whatsoever.  and um the world would be a better place.  the world would just be a better place.  hello perry.  good to see you in the chat today.  all right everybody.  that's the end.  what a what a great time it was.  i enjoyed myself so much.  i wish brad and mike or mark or my whatever brother's name from Home Improvement, we're here to enjoy it with me.
