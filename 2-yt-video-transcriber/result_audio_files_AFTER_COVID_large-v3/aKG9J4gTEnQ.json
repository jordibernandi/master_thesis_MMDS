            "text": "Hello, this is Dara Hoffman Fox, and I am reading to you from my book, You and Your Gender Identity, A Guide to Discovery.  We're in chapter three, which has to do with feeling the fear and doing it anyway.  The next part of this chapter has to do with how you can take a positive approach to your fears as they come up.  This isn't for everybody, but for those of you who it might work for, I invite you to listen to this.  Taking a positive approach.  If you believe in the power of the mind to change a negative to a positive, then give any or all of the following pointers a try.  Think of these as magic elixirs.  you can whip out of your cloak at the first sign of a fear arising and douse it with these tips.  Wow, I was feeling really creative that day.  Number one, remember, why are you doing this?  Quote, people don't transition to become less happy.  I heard this at the 2015 Transforming Gender Conference in Boulder, Colorado, and was struck by its simple yet empowering truth.  We all go through transitions over the course of our lifetimes.  We go through them hoping to improve our lives, even if it's totally nerve-wracking while we're going through it.  Whether or not you end up literally transitioning with regard to your gender identity, taking a closer look at yourself will more than likely result in a life transition for you.  So the first thing I ask you to do is to go back to your logline, and in the book it's on page 12, and I ask you to write it here.  So that's from an earlier video that you can look up.  that has to do with creating a logline.  This is your reminder of why it is.  you are tired of feeling the way you feel and of living the way you live.  Although you may have unhappy moments along the way, your goal is to move more toward happy or content or peaceful or balanced, whatever word works for you.  Two, focus on the possible positive outcomes.  Sometimes it's hard to know what you will end up enjoying after you go through a life transition.  Right now, take a moment to imagine what your life could be like several years after you have embarked upon your gender identity journey.  Think about what sorts of positive changes have occurred.  Let your mind wander through the possibilities of your new life.  List at least five positive changes that you can see resulting from making this life transition.  So then you'll write them down.  What you've written about, what you've written above gives you hope and hope is one of the most powerful elixirs you can use against fear.  Three, expose yourself to more positive narratives.  Many of you use social media and more than likely read through the feed on your favorite platforms several times a day.  More than likely, you are friends with or follow people who are transgender, non-binary, gender diverse, or questioning their gender identity.  You may follow or subscribe to groups and organizations that share these kinds of stories and experiences.  Next time you are perusing social media, pay attention to the types of videos, messages, and stories you are taking in.  Let's look closer at the first 10 to 20 posts, tweets, pictures, messages, or videos that you see.  How many of them leave you feeling better, inspired, motivated, excited?  And I have a line here for you to write that down.  So what I said was the first 20 things you look at, Keep track.  How many of them help you feel better?  How many of them leave you feeling worse, worried, defeated, depressed?  And then write that down here too.  If your worst number is higher than your better number, then something needs to change.  Go through and remove, hide, unlike, unfollow, or block the people and groups that you need to distance yourself from, even if it's just temporary, so you can increase the positive number of messages you are receiving and decrease the number of negative messages.  Start keeping track of your social media exposure and what it is that makes you feel better and what makes you feel worse.  Take this empowering step toward gaining control over the types of messages you are taking in on a daily basis.  So that's it for that part.  This is a very long chapter that has to do with feeling the fear and what to do about it.  So there's going to be a couple more suggestions that I have.  Next, we will be talking about how you can be kind to yourself in the meantime.  Thanks for listening and I'll see you in the next video. ",
