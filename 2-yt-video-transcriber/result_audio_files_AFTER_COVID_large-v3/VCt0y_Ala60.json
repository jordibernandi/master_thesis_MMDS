He's a young farm boy in rural Alberta who was pulled out of his tractor by his neck, pushed onto the pavement, and given scars that he has to this day.  He was also punched in the face by Alberta sheriffs in an act of police brutality that is rarely seen in Alberta.  Problem is, regular social justice warriors, folks who are opposed to police brutality, they weren't really interested in this case because Jeremiah was a white farm boy from rural Alberta.  He was a Catholic.  He doesn't fit the bill that Black Lives Matter really is interested in today.  But police brutality of any kind is a problem.  And this, what happened to Jeremiah, was particularly egregious.  The news today, well, the government of Alberta, their prosecutors, have dropped all charges against Jeremiah and the charges that were ascribed to his brother.  I spoke with them today at their farm.  They took a few minutes out of their harvest to speak with me about what went on and why they think the charges were dropped. ",

They're doing great work feeding the country and they're not at all the type of people that Alberta sheriffs or law enforcement should be prosecuting and giving criminal charges to and it's really confusing.  why Minister Doug Schweitzer, who was then the Minister of Justice and the Attorney General for Alberta, didn't immediately throw out these charges.  It took Minister Casey Maddow, the individual who replaced Minister Doug Schweitzer as Minister of Justice and Attorney General, to have these charges completely thrown out.  I was grateful that I was able to speak with Jeremiah here today.  The first time I came out to their farm to do the initial story on this, he was still too traumatized by what happened to speak on camera.  He was also worried with pending criminal charges that he might incriminate himself.  Since those charges have been dropped, he was happy to speak with me, and I was really glad we were able to tell his story fully, to let Albertans and Canadians know exactly what The consequences are for having a police force that is so out of touch with rural Alberta.  The RCMP ships in officers from Montreal to police rural southern Alberta, central Alberta, northern Alberta, across the country.  They're shuffling a deck of officers.  Now, the problem with Alberta sheriffs is they're not equipped at all to be dealing with rural Alberta either.  Their jobs typically are dealing with VIP protection, protecting courthouses, prisoner transfer.  And for some reason, they're also tasked with doing check stops in the middle of rural Alberta, a place that they rarely even visit, much less understand the customs and the law.  See, the tractor that Jeremiah was in wasn't subject to the same laws that vehicles that everyday folks drive on the highways is.  You don't even need a driver's license or a license plate to operate those vehicles, the tractor.  But the police didn't know that, and the consequences were dangerous and violent for Jeremiah, leaving a scar that he has to this day. ",

            "text": "When I was approaching the check stop, which I didn't know what it was because I was too far away from the sign just to read check stop on it.  I saw the lights, though, and there's probably about 10 vehicles, 9 or 8, 10 vehicles lined up, so the sign was still too far away to see when I approached the lineup.  And I'm like, oh, my field's just down the road a little bit.  I might as well just take the ditch the rest of the way and hit my field.  So I got into the ditch.  And as I was driving in the ditch, I saw this check stop sign.  And I'm like, oh, so I'll just keep driving until I get there and see what happens.  And when I got to about, there's a crossroad.  When I got to just about where the crossroad was, There's a sheriff waving me to stop and he had a mask on and gloves.  So I thought this had to do something with COVID maybe actually like checking for COVID breath.  And I'm not going to stop in the ditch because there's quite a steep slope there.  It's just too dangerous.  So I drove up on top of the crossroad.  I thought I'd maybe stop there and I wasn't even barely on the crossroad.  and a sheriff comes behind the vehicle and just slams the fender as hard as he can and that's that's what made me mad and like you know it scared me at first like what the heck is he doing?  and I look behind me and there's a sheriff there and I. so I stopped the vehicle and the tractor rolled to a stop and I opened my door and asked him what he wanted and then I couldn't quite make out the words he said but I know from hearing the recording later.  he said this is a mandatory alcohol screening check.  stop but I never heard those words.  the tractor he was still too far away and the tractor was running.  and then when he finally came to about where the door is I could hear him better.  and he asked me to shut the tractor off And I said no because gotta put the park brake on, then give it a few minutes to cool, then I can shut it off safely and then walk out of the tractor.  And so I declined that.  And then he asked me to do a breathalyzer, which I still thought was for COVID-19.  Because, you know, they're wearing masks and gloves and all that stuff.  And like, what would they be doing?  Why would they be doing breathalyzers for alcohol when there's COVID going on?  Yeah.  And so I said no to that.  And then he asked me maybe one more, one or two more times.  And I said no.  And then he asked me to, or actually he never asked me.  He asked me one or two times and I said no.  And then right away after that, he said, you're under arrest.  And he climbed into the tractor like really fast and started grabbing me.  And, you know, I'm like, whoa, the park brake's not on.  The tractor's not even off.  You think I'm getting out of a tractor like that?  It could roll.  It could do anything.  It's dangerous.  And so... I was holding on to the steering wheel in the seat, like I'm not getting out of the tractor in this situation.  And then a sheriff came up from behind him and gave me a good whap in the face with his fist.  And that's when I started bleeding because, you know, we hit my nose real good and my whole face right here.  And so there's blood going everywhere.  And then I was choking on blood.  And then the sheriff pushes me, my face to the ground.  And then he's like, you're resisting arrest.  I'm like, no, I'm not because he's on top of me.  I can't move.  And I couldn't even tell really what was going on.  But I think a sheriff came around the door and opened the other one and is pulling on me from there.  That's what it felt like.  So I was being pulled from like two directions and plus a sheriff on top of me.  And... And I kept telling him, I can't move, I can't, like, I can't move, I don't, what are you doing, get off of me.  And then finally when he realizes, like, he's on top of me and I can't move, then he kind of gets off of me.  And then they were able to pull me out of the tractor really fast.  And I barely, when I fell out of the tractor, I barely landed on one leg, but... like you saw in the video the sheriffs took most of the fall.  one went flying down and when I was about on one leg then the sheriffs grabbed my neck.  one jumps up and grabs me and pulls me down and that's when I hit the ground.  and then they handcuffed me.  and then about when they handcuffed me and they checked my pockets and everything for weapons which I don't have any weapons except a knife.  they call that a weapon I guess.  and That's when they stood me up and then they explained things a little bit better, like what this is.  But they still didn't tell me what the breathalyzer was for.  Like I asked like, I don't know, 20 or 30 times while I was handcuffed and they're walking me to the cruiser to put me in.  And he would not explain.  He's like, it's for public safety.  That doesn't tell me that it's for alcohol.  I still never even knew what it was for.  And I kept asking him, why do I have to do a breathalyzer?  For what reason?  Yes, it's for public safety, but what is it?  And he wouldn't tell me that.  And he didn't tell me I was going to be a criminal after I deny a breathalyzer.  He didn't explain things like that.  I'd be under arrest or that was mandatory.  I didn't know that either.  Like I've never been in a check stop in my entire life.  And then I happened to be in one with a tractor.  It's crazy.  And then they stuffed me into the police cruiser.  Well, actually, before they put me in the police cruiser, they wanted to check me with an ambulance because they saw blood.  And they wanted to check the sheriff to make sure he didn't get any infections or anything from my blood or any diseases, whatever.  And, you know, I haven't had food since morning.  And I haven't drank anything all day either because I don't even have time to take a drink of water.  That's the number one reason why my nose started bleeding.  I was really dry. ",

And after I was checked clear in the ambulance, they put me into the cruiser, and I probably sat there for two hours.  The vehicle was turned off, so the windows weren't open.  You know, I'm sitting there with handcuffs on, and I'm fidgeting around trying to find a comfortable way, plus with the heat.  And the sheriff comes in and out for like two hours, and I keep asking him how much longer.  What am I supposed to be doing here?  Why am I here?  And that's when my parents arrived.  then then that's when the situation happened with dominic and my parents and then finally i asked them that they finally released me and let me go to my parents.  but during that whole time i asked many times to phone home and they wouldn't give me that chance.  they wouldn't.  they wouldn't let me have any chance of, like, water.  I told him I hadn't drank or eaten for hours since morning.  And, you know, most of the questions I asked him, he ignored me.  He wouldn't.

I want to thank them again for allowing me to share their story about what is going on because the mainstream media certainly wasn't interested in doing it.

Sure, they sent one or two reporters out in the first place, but really their heart wasn't in the story because they don't care about rural Alberta.  It was Rebel News' story hitting over 700,000 views that I think contributed to the social pressure against the Crown prosecutors and the Ministry of Justice that caused this to be dropped.  I really think that's true, and I want to thank you, the viewer, who may have gone to helpjeremiah.com to pitch in a few bucks to help out their family, or maybe you shared the story with your friends.  to point out this egregious case of police brutality in rural Alberta.  It's not okay wherever it happens.  And even though the social justice warriors at Black Lives Matter didn't care about this at all, I'm glad that you did and you shared the story.  And it's important that we let folks know that the charges were now dropped because of the pressure that was put on the government and the Crown prosecutors.
