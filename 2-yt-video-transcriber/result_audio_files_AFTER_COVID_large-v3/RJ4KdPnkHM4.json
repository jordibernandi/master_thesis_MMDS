Then we get the 1960s, and there's a shift to acquiring political capital, integrating political institutions.  The Voting Rights Act comes along, and it was a tremendous success.  You had voter registration rates in 1964 in the South, places like Georgia, Alabama, single digits, black voter registration rates.  A year after the Civil Rights Act, they're up to the 50%, 60%.  I mean, it was a tremendous success.  It worked.  And then the leadership, the black leadership in particular, turned to focus on electing more black officials.  And the thinking was, if we could elect more black officials, the rest will take care of itself.  black socioeconomic advancement will flow naturally from black political clout.  We just need to get more of our kind into office, and the rest will take care of itself. ",

They're for charters, they're for vouchers, at much higher rates than whites.  Obama becomes president of the United States and spends eight years trying to shut down a school voucher program in his own backyard in Washington, D.C.  that was started by his predecessor, George W. Bush.  Why?  Why?  The first black president could enhance this program that he knows, poll after poll shows, is popular in the black community.  The reason is that Barack Obama is no longer simply... Another black person, he's now a black president.  He has special interests that are nipping at his heels.  He wants to be re-elected.  He has to indulge these special interests, one of whom are teachers unions who oppose school choice.  because many of these schools aren't unionized and don't use union labor.  So Obama has a choice.  Am I going to side with my political benefactors or am I going to side with this black constituency that helped put me in office?  He made his choice.  He sided with the teachers unions. ",
