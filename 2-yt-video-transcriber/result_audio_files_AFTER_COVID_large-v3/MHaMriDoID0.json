He's not afraid of dying from the coronavirus.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, he was on his porch and he was smiling.  Yeah, he was smiling and he just appeared to be too happy because I was watching MSNBC and they said that we're all supposed to be in complete total fear.  And if you don't believe you're going to die by going on your front porch, that means you're a Trump supporter.  So Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I saw him.  He was playing with his kids.  He shook somebody's hand.  Yeah, yeah, I know, right?  Yeah, so please, you got to send an officer right away because we can't have people walking around not living in fear because everybody knows we're all going to die and they need to understand that.  Right, thank you.  I'll see you soon.  Goodbye. ",
