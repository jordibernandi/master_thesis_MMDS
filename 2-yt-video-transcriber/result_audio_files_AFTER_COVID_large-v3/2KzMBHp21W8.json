            "text": "hey guys sorry i haven't uploaded in a bit.  i've been pulling sixty to almost seventy hour work weeks uh... and you know cuz i know a lot of people who are unemployed right now and just looking at the news and seeing the job unemployment rates i gotta take advantage of it when it presents itself you know so but it's not really physically demanding it's just uh... draining.  so but i've worked out a uh... method hopefully for optimization so i can get some more videos out.  But anyways, today I was driving and I heard a song on the radio.  I'll put the song on at the end of the clip here.  But basically, it's a song about a girl being a lonely chick.  And it really got me thinking, amused but also simultaneously repulsed.  Because it's a misinterpretation of the idea and the definition of loneliness between men and women.  where loneliness for women is basically boredom men on the other hand experience an existential loneliness and I want to walk through this difference today.  so for women The concept of loneliness really eludes them because they've never truly had to face that.  They don't have to.  It's in their nature.  And it's in the structure of society that prevents them from experiencing true loneliness.  I've done this with several women, I think five or six, from girlfriends to friends with benefits to coworkers and just acquaintances.  If they haven't had a Tinder account, I... i make one for them or not for them but with them.  you know cuz girls always have hundreds of pictures on their phones at all times.  so it's kinda like a little activity.  make a tinder account see what you get the swipe uh... i don't know left or right but swipe uh... like positive on everyone and see the hundred percent match rate on tinder.  this applies to anything.  ok cupid.  What's the other one?  Bumble or something.  100% success rate.  I've even done this with my sextal.  I did it once and I got the account banned, but I was getting genuine messages.  Even from guys who knew it was a sextal.  It was really weird.  I wanted to do that to illustrate there's not really a concept or a basis for female loneliness.  and these women, the five or six that I did this with, they ranged in all over the scale, you know, from a land whale to like a really attractive chick.  So it doesn't matter.  There's always an outlet for them to have support.  There's always a support network for women.  Now beyond casual hookups, women have an army of not necessarily simps or betas but just men looking for a deeper connection.  so they always have that safety net.  they have people willing to listen to their dreams and desires and to support them.  beyond parents you know just society at large.  all of these diversity programs we always talk about.  society is structured to support women.  And even before it went fully, totally gynocentric, women always have a set and defined place in society.  Even before egalitarianism plagued the West, even before gynocentrism corrupted masculinity, brought it down to its knees, a woman has a defined place in society, regardless of what society that is.
