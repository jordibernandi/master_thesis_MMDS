And this video was actually inspired by a subscriber who asked the question in the comment section of a video I posted a couple of days ago.  It's coming from, I believe it's CAIGAND.  and the question is how much silver is the target goal?  so first and foremost thank you so much for asking the question.  i look forward to answering it throughout the course of the video and if anybody watching right now has a question for me head on down to the comments and ask away.  i'd be more than happy to dedicate an entire video to you and answering your questions.  so first things first my target goal how much silver do i want?  I'm not stacking silver for short term solutions, for short term problems.  I think if financial hardships pop up into my life, I think that's probably more ideal for the dollar bill to take care of.  I consider silver to be more of a long term solution to a long term problem because I'm trying to preserve my wealth.  for decades to come and use it as a tool, as a hedge against inflation.  But I thought it would be kind of interesting to calculate how many ounces of silver it would take to cover different type of monthly expenses.  So the answer for me, since I'm not stacking for that reason is, as much as humanly possible.  but for the person who just wants to put their dollars into silver to help save it for a rainy day that's what i kind of want to do with today's video.  so i think it's important to remember that every single person watching this video right now lives a different lifestyle earns a different salary and has different expenses.  so it's going to vary person to person.  but hopefully my method of calculating can help you figure out how many ounces of silver it would take to take care of your monthly expenses.  So some people might be living in a small apartment.  They might just be paying maybe about $900 a month in rent.  And with the current spot price being at about $23, spot's been kind of fluctuating the last couple days, the last week or so, between 20 and 30 bucks.  So let's just find a solid number, meet right in the middle, and call it $25 per ounce.  $900 towards rent divided by $25 per ounce would equate to 36 ounces of silver as I'm recording the video.  But maybe you're not paying rent.  Maybe you're making mortgage payments and maybe you have a really big house and maybe you're paying closer to $2,500 a month.  towards that.  that according to current spot price would be about 100 ounces of silver as i'm recording the video now.  it's not just a roof over your head.  you got to worry about.  you got to feed yourself as well and it also really depends on how many people you have sitting at your dinner table.  for example if you were to spend 200 a month on groceries only feeding yourself Kind of like me.  I don't have a wife.  I don't have kids.  I plan on keeping it that way.  So I don't have anybody to worry about but myself.  And if that costs you about $200, that's about 8 ounces of silver as I'm recording the video.  But maybe you're married.  Maybe you have one kid.  If you're feeding two people and that costs you about $400 a month on groceries, that would be about 16 ounces of silver as I'm recording the video.  but maybe you're married with two kids.  Now you got four people to worry about rather than two and rather than one.  So that might be closer to $800 a month just on groceries, which would equate to about 32 ounces of silver as I'm recording the video.  So what you can do is take how much money it costs to keep a roof over your head, how much money it takes to feed yourself and feed the people that you have to take care of.  You also got to factor in car, phone, tuition, and any other expenses that you have.  And what you can do is add up all of your monthly expenses, every penny, that you need to pay someone else to live the lifestyle that you live and then divide that by the current spot price, which as I'm recording the video is about $23, $24.  It might fluctuate by the time you're watching this video.  You might watch it the day that I post it.  You might watch it three weeks down the road.  You might watch it in the year 2024 for all I know.  Whenever you're watching this video, figure out your monthly expenses and then divide that by the current spot price, whatever it is as you're watching this video.  But there's one more thing that you have to take into consideration.  There's one more thing that you need to do when it comes to this mathematical equation.  First thing, add up all your monthly expenses.  Second thing, divide that by the current spot price.  And now the third thing that you have to do is multiply that new number by how many months you want to prepare for.  If you are using silver as a tool for financial preparation, number one, I would probably suggest Doing a little bit of research on gold as well.  I think that diversification is key.  I don't think that silver should be absolutely everything.  So maybe consider looking into gold as well.  While of course, stacking a little bit of that fiat, the glorified IOU dollar alongside your precious metals.  But moving away from all that, you got to figure out how many months you want to prepare for.  A lot of people will tell you that you should have at least a month or two worth of expenses saved up as an emergency fund just in case.  I say a month or two is definitely better than nothing and definitely better than the average person.  But I feel like it's a little bit short-sighted, especially with everything that we've seen over the last couple of months.  What happens if there's a pandemic and you're out of work for three plus months, which is why I've been saying for about two and a half years now that I think three to six months minimum is what people should prepare for.  And that doesn't just go for the finances.  That goes for the food.  You can actually remove food from your list of expenses if you stack up some food little by little as well.  If every single week you go to the store and buy the food that you need for the week, maybe consider buying a little bit of extra stuff that has a longer shelf life.  The canned soups, the beans, the rice, the dry pasta, the things that last a long time.  That way, if something were to go down and you picked up just a couple cans of food every single week for let's just say the last two years, which is what I did, not to say that I was fully prepared, not to say that I didn't have to leave my house for 10 years because I'm good.  I have 10 years worth of food.  No, but if something were to go wrong, whether it's on a micro level, meaning just for me, let's just say I got laid off of work and that's it, or on a more macro level where there's a pandemic where 40 million people make unemployment claims, and it's not just the country, it's all around the globe, so... I would definitely say that's macro, but regardless, micro or macro, you'll be a little bit more prepared than the average Joe, which is what I experienced.  I spent the last two years stacking a little bit of food, not all that much.  Every once in a while, I'd pick up an extra couple things and I'd put it in the pantry, just in case, and then I'd rotate them.  So when the entire planet shut down, I remember saying to myself, I will not be able to last months and months and months and months and months, years and years and years, but several weeks, maybe two, three, four months, I'm fine.  I'm perfectly okay when it comes to food.  So rather than worrying about having the cash or the money stored away that you can use to run to the store and buy food you can kind of reduce that dollar amount or that number of ounces by a little bit.  if you're stacking a little bit of food as well.  You don't have to worry about running to the store while everyone's getting into fist fights over toilet paper.  If you stack the toilet paper before you absolutely need it, if you stack the food before you absolutely need it, if you stack the money before you absolutely need it.  I think being one step ahead of the game is ideal, but being 5, 10, 15, 20 steps ahead of the game is absolutely vital.  And I think that's what a lot of people do when they're in the realm of prepping, whether they're prepping from a financial aspect, aka the silver and the gold, or they're prepping in other ways, the food, the medical supplies, the methods of water purification.  These are all things that should be taken into account, and once again, most importantly, don't have all your eggs in one basket.  All the money in the world won't do you any good if there's a shortage of the things that you need to buy.  You might say, oh, I got a million dollars saved up.  I'll buy food when I need it.  What good is your million dollars if the shelves are empty at the store?  So do not put all your eggs in one basket.  Diversify and then diversify how you diversify.  I think that's absolutely vital.  I think that is absolutely key.  And I think that is probably the secret.  But I'm not a financial advisor.  Nothing on this channel is financial advice.  It's all for entertainment purposes.  but it's also to initiate a conversation.  So I hope my videos can spark a discussion.  So number one, I'm curious, what are your thoughts?  And two, there's something else that I need to point out.  There's one more thing that I wanted to add to all of this that we're talking about.  One more thing that I wanted to share in today's video, which is arguably the most important aspect of everything that I've said so far, which is spot price of silver fluctuates.  If you are counting on silver, holding its value to the T, you are kidding yourself.  If you think that your monthly expenses divided by the current spot price is all you're going to need for the rest of your life, that sounds like a disaster waiting to happen in my opinion and from my perspective.  Because guess what?  Silver does go up.  We've seen silver go up the last couple days, the last week, last week and a half, two weeks, whatever it's been.  Silver has climbed.  Silver was sitting pretty in the $18 range for a little while.  And then what happened last week?  $19.  What happened a day later?  $20.  What happened the next day?  $21.  What happened after the weekend went by?  $22, then $23, then $24, then $25, then $26.  And guess what happened after that?  It went back down to $25, then $24, and now $23.  as I'm recording the video.  Silver is very sporadic.  So if you're going to bank on silver sitting at or around the $20 to $25 to $30 range, That's probably not the greatest idea.  And the reason I say that is because a lot of people were putting all their hopes and dreams into silver in 2011 when it went all the way up to $50.  A lot of people bought in at 50 bucks.  Being like, wow, I can put all my monthly expenses into silver because each ounce of silver is about $50.  What happened?  Silver went down to 45 and 40. then 35, then 30, 25, 20, 15, then you kind of fluctuate it in the 13, 14, 15 dollar range for a very, very long time.  Which brings us around full circle.  Don't put all your eggs in one basket.  Don't count on silver for absolutely everything.  It's not good, it's not right, it's not healthy to rely on anything or anyone entirely.  Other than yourself.  If you can rely on yourself to get yourself out of a sticky situation, that's really all you need.  But, It's helpful to have tools.  It's helpful to have a little bit of silver for certain reasons, a little bit of gold for other reasons, maybe some cash for other reasons as well.  Maybe you have other types of investments.  Maybe you have the food stocked up.  Maybe you have this stocked up, that stocked up.  You're pretty well diversified.  And if something were to go wrong, you might be shown where you're weak in certain areas.  but your strengths in all of those other areas are gonna pretty much make up for that.  That's what I learned.  This whole lockdown, when that occurred, it showed me the areas that I was lacking in and all of the areas where I was fully prepared in.  I was pretty okay.  So in conclusion, every single person watching this video lives a different lifestyle, earns a different salary, and has different expenses.  So figure it out, calculate, what makes the most sense for you.  and if you're going to be stacking for the long term, why are you doing that?  How much silver are you going to need for that?  If you're going to be stacking for the short term or just for a quick little emergency fund if something were to go wrong, you might want to consider cash instead or cash mixed with silver rather than just relying on silver entirely.  Like I said, I'm not a financial advisor.  This isn't financial advice.  It's all for entertainment purposes only, but it's also to initiate a conversation.  So I'm curious, what are your thoughts?

Maybe you're just trying to cover your monthly expenses if something were to go wrong.  Maybe you're stacking a little bit of silver and a little bit of cash, maybe some gold as well.
