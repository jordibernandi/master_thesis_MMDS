            "text": "The Word on Fire Bible is designed to bring God's Word to life in a fresh way.  Christians will uncover new insights, but it was made also for people reading the Bible for the first time.  The first volume consists of the four Gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, which offer four unique portraits of the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth.  What will you experience when you open up the Word on Fire Bible?  It's a feast, not just for the mind, but for the imagination and the heart as well.  Let me point out four particular elements.  First, you'll observe the biblical text is laid out in an easy-to-read, single-column format.  This provides a legible and immersive reading experience, more like a novel than a textbook.  Second, you'll notice the biblical text is surrounded by nearly 2,000 years of spiritual wisdom.  The Bible's been read, studied, prayed over, and preached on by saints and sages for centuries.  And the Word on Fire Bible brings you the riches of their contemplation.  For example, you'll find commentaries from the Church Fathers, You'll discover writings from spiritual masters such as St.  Thomas Aquinas and St.  John Paul II, along with literary geniuses such as Flannery O'Connor and G.K.  Chesterton.  And finally, you'll hear from me, Bishop Robert Barron.  A third feature you'll notice in the Word on Fire Bible is the exegesis of key words in Greek, the language of the New Testament authors.  These will bring you to a deeper understanding of the history and meaning of the text.  Fourth, and most strikingly, you'll notice the beauty of this Bible.  Exquisite selections of art from across the centuries illumine pertinent scriptural passages and draw you into what Pope Francis calls the via pulchritudinous, the way of beauty.  When you attend a liturgy at a beautiful cathedral, you hear the Word of God proclaimed from the pulpit, However, that word is clarified by the surrounding experience, the architecture, the art, the stained glass windows, the icons.  You'll enjoy a similar encounter as you make your way through the Word on Fire Bible.  Let me show you how these four elements come together in a sample section taken from the beginning of the Gospel of Luke.  Here we find the Bible's most detailed account of Jesus' birth.  If the narrative commences, you'll read a reflection from the second century church father, St.  Irenaeus, contrasting the figure of Mary with the Old Testament figure of Eve.  You'll also find two passages from Pope Benedict XVI reflecting on the mystery of Mary's yes to God.  And you'll enjoy a poem from Chesterton, in which he beautifully writes, to the end of the way of the wandering star, to the things that cannot be and that are, to the place where God was homeless and all men are at home.  Then I explain how the Nativity of Jesus is far from simply a charming story.  Rather, Luke's account of the Holy Birth is a politically subversive tale of competing kings, the power-hungry Lord of the world versus the true Lord, the Kyrios.  a term which you'll see highlighted in the original Greek.  Two sublime works of art shed light on Luke's narrative as well.  Botticelli's Madonna of the Magnifica and the Annunciation of Fra Angelico, the Renaissance artist who inspired the Word on Fire Bible's custom font.  Evangelical in its purpose, accessible to all, illuminating in its words, distinctive in its beauty.  The Word on Fire Bible is not just a book.  It's a kind of cathedral in print.  And it doesn't simply contain a collection of stories for Christians.  It invites you, whatever your background, to enter into the story of Christ. ",
