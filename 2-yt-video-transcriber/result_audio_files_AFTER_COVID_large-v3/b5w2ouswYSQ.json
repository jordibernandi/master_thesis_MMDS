            "text": "Okay, hypers, if you're aware of a YouTuber by the name of Peter Coffin.  I think we all know who they are.  They go by.  they them pronouns, by the way, so let's not do any misgenderinos in chat.  We all know who Peter Coffin is.  I don't think I need to give an introduction.  We all know.  So this may surprise you.  But me and Peter Coffin, while I wouldn't go as far as to say we were friends, because I think to call someone a friend sort of requires a bit more camaraderie than the level that we had, I was certainly an acquaintance of Peter Coffin to a degree.  I actually made multiple videos in which I defended Peter Coffin from particularly the woke scolds.  I don't think I need to go on about how much woke scolds upset me, okay?  I really don't like woke scolds.  They call everybody in BreadTube, like, they tend to be quite abusive.  I haven't talked about them in a while.  Sometimes I mention them in passing, but I don't really talk about them all that much anymore, all right?  that they're very cringe, and they tend to be very, very abusive, especially to creators that they like to go after, okay?  And they like to go after Peter Coffin a lot.  They accuse Peter Coffin of being a class reductionist, a racist, at some points even a fucking pedophile.  I actually made a whole video about that, defending Peter Coffin.  Let's see if I can find it.  Let us see, where is it?  Where is it?  Um... Let's see if I can find it.  Here it is.  Look at that.  Look at that.  War on Bread Tube.  Peter Coffin drama in the War on Bread Tube.  This is a video I made defending Peter Coffin against claims that they were a pedophile.  I apologize.  Did I misgender?  Hopefully I didn't misgender.  That they are a pedophile.  That was the claim being made.  And I've also defended them on a couple of other allegations towards them that I viewed as being quite terrible and unsubstantiated.  And I liked Peter Coffin for quite a while.  And me and Peter Coffin got along quite a bit.  I didn't really buy any claims that they were a class reductionist.  And things were all good.  It was all peachy keen, fantastic.  But then something bad happened.  Bernie lost the Democratic Party's nomination and Biden won.  And the topic of Bernie or bust started to become pretty damn prominent.  Whether or not we should vote for Biden to beat Trump.  And at the end of the day, we ended up beating Trump.  Biden won.  We beat Trump.  It was fantastic.  But whenever this discussion was happening, we saw a lot of leftists, disappointedly, coming out as Bernie or bust.  And along with that, revealing that maybe they don't care as much about the rights and the well-being of marginalized groups as I may have initially thought.  And I know many other people had the same reaction.  Like, for example, Peter Coffin.  So Peter went really, really hard on the Bernie or Bust stuff.  And then they went really hard on some pseudo class reductionist arguments, some accelerationist arguments.  I don't have any on hand right now because I didn't fucking gather them, but, you know, we'll get into that in a minute.  They started going off on a few pseudo Bernie or Buzz, pseudo kind of class reductionist accelerationist arguments.  For example, their friend Angie Speaks, who here knows who Angie Speaks is?  Pretty good close friend of Peter Coffin?  Any hypers in chat?  Anyone here know about Angie Speaks?  Well, she tweeted that she would come the hardest she'd ever came in her life if Trump beats Biden just to own the libs.  She tweeted that.  You have to understand that when somebody tweets something like that, it becomes pretty damn clear that maybe they don't give as much of a shit about the rights of minorities and marginalized groups as they care about dunking on libs.  And so I just sort of kept it to myself.  I was pretty cringing.  I was cringing pretty hard about that.  But what really sort of got me to not like Peter and Angie anymore after being, you know, pretty big fans of them was when Vosh was doing a Minecraft stream.  I believe it was a Minecraft stream.  It may have been another game stream, but I remember at least I was playing Minecraft when I heard it.  Vosh was doing a phone stream.  He was moving from his old room in his house to a new room.  And he was doing a phone stream.  And someone asked him what his thoughts were.  Peter Coffin and Angie speaks.  And Vosh's response was, and I quote as closely as I can remember, eh, I think they might have some class reductionist tendencies.  Peter and Angie fucking lost it on Twitter after that.  So Angie Speaks then went on to tweet something along the lines of, Vosh is a freak.  Shortly after that, progressively, Peter and Angie started making allusions to the idea that Vosh is a pedophile, and then continued on to sort of break down with the pro-Bernier bust shit and just hating libs as much as possible.  Now, after that, Peter Coffin and Angie sort of became laughingstocks in leftist spaces because, you know, you know how it is, right?  If you're sort of a dumbfuck class reductionist or at least bordering that, then you're going to get shit for it.  But I guess it's kind of been wearing down on them because they tweeted, Peter\u2014 Peter Coffin is out of patience.  By the way, I'm blocked by Peter Coffin.  I had to go into incognito mode to open this up.  I've literally never said anything, like, derogatory towards Peter.  Not even really on stream, I don't think, up until this point.  And definitely not on Twitter, as far as I'm aware.  I could have.  I don't remember.  But I feel like I would remember if I, like, shit-talked Peter.  I probably shit-talked Angie, but I don't know about Peter on stream.  Xander Hall, important related tweets if you don't have them already.  Angie and Peter supporting someone very, very bad, transphobic bullying.  I'm not a fan of Corviday.  I do hate Corviday.  But this is actually pretty good.  I will support Corviday on spreading this around.  Yeah, who's aware of Kelly Zahos?  So Kelly Zahos is a friend of Peter's.  This was one of the first, this was one of the first, oh wow, she renamed herself to the Spectre.  Kelly Zahos is a friend of Peter's who is kind of a TERF, kind of a transphobe.  uh basically is the borderline right wing kind of centrist tim pool type class reduction.  it's really hard.  it's like god political labels escape this woman it's crazy.  uh she's basically trying to take contrapoints and philosophy tubes brand and instead sort of um use it to push a pseudo-left, more class-reductionist, anti-woke perspective.  It's really fucking weird.  Peter is friends with this person, a patron of theirs.  It's really fucking weird.  Yeah, so here's a tweet from Kelly.  So this middle-aged man... has been stalking me across platforms for a year looking for ways to de-platform me and a little birdie just told me that he has a discord for his fanbase of 40k and that 75% of the discourse is about me.  all they do is post my tweets and talk about me.  lol pretty sure the person they're talking about is a trans woman.  so you know good friend of peter coffin.  uh Just the standard narco, self-aggrandizing, self-pitying indulgence.  Sorry, folks, no stream tonight.  Awful dysphoria hours.  So this is a friend of Kelly.  Oh, Lord, lol.  I hope Jessica Yaniv's twin brother gets over it for his own mental health and stops smearing and harassing women on the internet for merely disagreeing with them.  Friend of Peter Coffin's, by the way.  Kelly, bread tubers when they're a teenage fan, they've been stalking turns 18.  Friend of Peter Coffin, by the way.  Curio, the bullying victim, is non-binary.  and another relating tweet to look at.  Oh, God, you guys are just hitting me up.  Thank you.  Peter Coffin, why do you follow this person?  Here is why they are bad.  The bigger question is why you think you have any influence over who I follow or any idea why I follow them.  Your brain is rotting.  Go away.  This is basically a stage where people are looking to do guilt by association, which only works with your crowd.  BreadTube fandom, why you think I exit?  Guilt by association.  You don't have a valid argument by claiming guilt by association when you literally give money to the person that we're talking about and signal boost them, okay?  So, yeah.  This is the person that Peter Kaufman has been signal boosting, is friends with, and is a patron of.  So after getting shit about this kind of shit for a while now... Peter Coffin is now hashtag walking away.  They are walking away.  BreadTube, the current iteration of the skeptic movement.  People are beginning to get that.  Problem is, what comes next cannot just be the skeptic movement 3.0.  We need to hit the reset button, reject BreadTube, and move on.  We do not need a BreadTube dunking industrial complex anymore.  So yeah, basically their hashtag walking away, I guess.  Yeah, and then they also tweeted this.  I'm not going to refer to the essentialism parading around calling itself anti-racism as anti-racism anymore.  Going to call it woke racism.  Permanent radicalization and fetishization of standpoint of woke racism.  Basically, they're just getting mad about... I guess black people being too militant with their anti-racism, I guess.  These things are ultimately essentialism.  That is to say, woke racism essentializes\u2014 I think you guys get the fucking idea.  Basically, Peter Coffin has been going on just for the last, like\u2014 honestly, last few months, but most recently for the last week or so, about how they're going to leave BreadTube, how they're abandoning it, how the left is getting too woke scoldy and too virtue signally and too woke.  It's fucking weird.  Okay, guys, listen to me.  Usually, when I talk about woke scolds, I'm going after the woke scolds.  Overwhelmingly, that's what I'm doing.  But listen to me.  woke scolds are not and have never been a valid reason to not be a leftist, okay?  They suck, okay?  They bully, they lie, they harass, they dogpile people that agree with them on 90% of issues, if not more, and they make the left look really bad, all right?  But they are not the end of the world.  And notice how\u2014and I guarantee\u2014 Me and Vosh have gotten more shit from Wokescolds than Peter Coffin has, okay?  And you don't see me.  or Vosh hashtag walking away from the left or hashtag walking away from BreadTube or fucking platforming, signal boosting, and giving money to TERFs.  It doesn't happen.  It doesn't fucking happen, okay?  Peter, get your shit together, my dude.  Please.  I defended you when it came to the woke scolds, alright?  You know I'm not a woke scold.  You know that I'm not like an ultra-woke fucking woke-lit lefty or whatever.  You know that's not the case.  You've heard my arguments.  You've seen I've defended you from these people.  I know who they are.  I've seen their arguments.  I argue against them all the time.  You know this.  This is a heart-to-heart with you right now, Peter, if you ever see this.  please stop just stop.  okay just it's time to stop.  okay no more.  this right here is cringe.  you are posting cringe peter and you you just need to stop.  same goes for angie i'm going to come.  when trump wins and blows the liberals out speaks okay same towards her.  all right it's time to stop.  Just quit it.  Alright?  You guys have to be careful.  You really do.  Don't let hatred for woke scolds or tankies or whatever push you.  from the left.  it should make you more left.  it should make you at the very least want to convert those people or hell.  even just excise them from your communities to make the left stronger.  don't let them push you out of the left.  that is weak.  it is weak to let woke scolds and other undesirable groups in the left make you leave the left.  okay that it makes you weak.  it makes you fucking weak.  Anyway, if you enjoyed this video, please leave a like.  I appreciate it a lot.  If you want to see more from me, drop a sub.
