            "text": "In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.  Well, it's now nearly three weeks since the time that a revolution took off, began here in our local community.  and spread quite literally like wildfire, or I guess we should say arson fire, spread from the Twin Cities here across major cities of the United States and even into distant countries.  It is a revolution.  It has little to do with the unjust act of a police officer toward one individual.  That is the excuse for a revolution.  It is a revolution which is filled with rage and contempt and hatred and violence.  and murder.  Here in our own Twin Cities more than 1,500 buildings have been burned to the ground or burned inside out or smashed to smithereens and or looted.  More than 1,500 buildings.  and in other places the similar fires have been set and lives have been lost or rather lives have been taken by homicide.  make no mistake about it.  this rioting this murderous destructive rage is nothing short of a revolution.  and I I go back almost 60 years to another time when we had a revolution taking place in our streets and on our campuses.  I was very young at the time, but still remember seeing images on our old black and white television, you know, the ones that took one to two minutes to warm up, seeing images of flags being burned, Race riots in the streets, demonstrations on college campuses.  It was a revolution.  A revolution intended to change things in America.  And change has taken place.  But I fear this revolution even more.  Not only because I am older and understand more of what's happening, but this revolution seeks such a radical change that it's really seeking change through collapse.  It is a revolution of anarchists, arsons, and terrorists.  They literally want to collapse our society.  as we know it, to replace it with something else.  The revolution in the streets of America.  But you know, there's another revolution that is taking place now that we should be fearful of, and it too had its roots in the 60s.  It is the revolution within the institutional Catholic Church.  Not coincidentally, as the revolution was taking place in society, there was a revolution taking place even within the bosom of the Church in the 60s.  A revolution that has sought and continues to seek A change to nearly every aspect of Catholic life.  Seeks to change our doctrines.  Seeks to change the Mass and the Sacraments.  Seeks to change morality.  Seeks to change Catholic practice.  No area left untouched.  Just as that change began in the 60s and continues now more fervently than ever, like the streets, the revolution has been within the church itself.  In the past week or so, a great man, a great church man, Archbishop Vigan\u00f2, has written two public letters.  One to a president and one to the public, really to Catholics and others who should be Catholic.  Archbishop Vigano wrote an open letter to President Trump in which he warned our president that the revolution in the streets, as represented by these riots and acts of violence, is really warfare.  Warfare of what the Archbishop calls and Scripture calls the children of darkness making war against the children of the light.  Those are not racial images.  Those are biblical images that come from Christ Jesus himself.  You're either of the light of God, the light of Christ, or you're of the darkness of the prince of this world.  And Archbishop Vigano warns our president that this is a war.  It is a revolution.  The children of darkness have malevolent intentions.  Make no mistake about it.  They want to overthrow our society.  They want to put it into chaos.  They want to destroy the world as we know it.  because the Prince of Darkness wants to destroy our world, overturn our laws, ",
