Did I see it coming?  Of course I did.  But it's here.  And I comply because I do have to go and shop for food.  And I do have to take my kids to school.  And I do have to take a flight to go from A to B. It's a new world.  And there is a new world order.  And we better understand that, yes, all the way to the end, you need to fight, but you don't need to fight for the vaccination.  You need to fight for the gospel.  And instead of preaching the gospel, all we do all day long is chit-chatting about vaccinations and chit-chatting about this and about that.  Get your energy spent on the most important things that will yield fruits for the kingdom of God. ",
