            "text": "Hi, I want to talk to you today about truth, and specifically a traditional approach to truth called the correspondence theory of truth.  Philosophical theories of truth take a number of different forms.  Some of them are minimalist theories that try to say, in a sense, there's no substantive theory to be had about the nature of truth.  All we can do is describe the logic of our talk of truth.  And that attempt really tries to say there is no bigger issue here.  But the correspondence theory disagrees.  So, let's start with the common ground of an understanding of the concept of truth.  Even that turns out to be complicated.  I'll talk about that complication separately.  But the general idea is simple enough.  You could say, snow is white is true if and only if snow is white.  And you might think that's all there is to say about truth.  Maybe we can have a slightly more complicated theory that says, well, I can say, hey, that's true, rather than repeating that.  So if somebody says, snow is white, and I say, that's true, that's simply a way of saying what you said, that's true, and it's a convenient way of repeating, basically, snow is white.  And so there are a variety of ways of thinking about this.  Maybe it enables us to say more complicated things like, whatever that person says is true.  The concept of truth is one that you might say we could use independently of any philosophical theory of truth.  However, it seems to make sense to say a little bit more about the concept of truth.  After all, what makes it true that snow is white?  We can say, snow is white, the sentence is true if and only if snow is white.  But then we can say, well, what makes it true that snow is white?  You can say, well, the fact that snow is white.  That seems like a natural, plausible, and true response.  But notice what we're saying there.  We're saying that there is something like, a fact in the world, a fact that snow is white.  Correspondingly you might say the sentence snow is white is true because there is such a fact.  That is one way of thinking about the correspondence theory.  So we might think of a sentence like snow is white and say that's true if and only if Snow is white.  And we can think, okay, here is a sentence.  So this is a bit of language.  If we imagine someone speaking, we can think, aha, this is what they're saying.  Right?  Here is the sentence.  Snow is white.  And then that's true if and only if snow is white.  If there is a fact.  So here is, let's say, oh my, now I can't really draw a snowflake, and I can't really indicate that it's white with this black marker.  But here we've got something about the world, and I'll just say, you know, here are the snowflakes falling, and they're white.  So here we might say we have a fact.  Here is some kind of sentence or statement.  And then we might think of truth as something like a relationship between a sentence and the world when there is such a fact.  So we could say snow is white is true if and only if there is a fact that snow is white.  And in general we could say this sentence is true if and only if it corresponds to some fact.  Maybe the earliest expression of something like this is in Aristotle who says to say of what is that it is or to say of what is not that it is not is true.  To say of what is that it is not or of what is not that it is is false.  And that would be a way of saying Things are true when they correspond to the way things are.  If you say that something is and it is, that's true.  If you say that something is not and it is not, that's also true.  If you say something is and it's not that way, however, that's false.  And if you say it's not that way and it is that way, Eh, that's also false.  And so Aristotle is basically saying, look, there's a way things are, and a sentence is true if and only if it corresponds to the way things are.  If you say it the way it is, tell it like it is.  If you tell it like it is, what you say is true.  If you tell it like it isn't, what you say is false.  And so that's a way of thinking about this correspondence idea.  Let's take another classic example, a sentence like, the cat is on the mat.  Well, we can have a similar kind of picture.  Here we have a person, and they're saying, in this case, I'll draw it slightly larger here, they're uttering the sentence, the cat is on the map.  And now, you get to see some of my great artwork.  Here we have the world, and here we have a cat on a map.  So here is our cat, here is our map.  And now, we could say something a little bit more specific.  We can say, notice the world here is understood as containing certain things, like the cat and the mat, certain relations between the things, like the cat being on the mat.  So, as Aristotle would have thought, the world consists of objects, substances, they have properties, they stand in certain relations to one another, they occupy certain positions at certain times, and so forth.  Now, If we look at this sentence, we can say something more specific than simply saying there is this relation of correspondence.  Correspondence, there is a kind of fact in the world.  We can also say here something a little more specific.  We can say, notice the parts of this sentence.  We can break down the sentence into various components that correspond to substances, that correspond to qualities, that correspond to relations, that correspond to positions, and states, and actions, and being acted upon, and so on.  So here we've got the cat.  Well clearly, that is something that has a certain relationship to the cat.  The mat, that refers to that object, that substance, and then is on, well, that's something that seems to connect to, in this case, the relationship of the cat being on the mat.  So now we can say, yes, the correspondence is not only general, there is a fact that the cab is on the mat, but also something a bit more specific.  Parts of the sentence correlate with substances, qualities, relations, positions, states, and so on and so forth of things in the world.  And once we think about that sort of thing, the various linguistic units here correspond to substances, to qualities, to relations, to states, to actions, to affections, to positions, in such a way that we have a relationship between the various components of the sentence and the various components of the world.  One way of thinking about this is what Wittgenstein, following some earlier philosophers, calls the picture theory.  The sentence gives us something like a picture of the world.  Now, of course, not literally, but think about an actual photograph, a real picture of a cat on an actual mat.  Notice that in the picture, the image of the cat corresponds to a cat.  The image of the mat corresponds to a mat.  And then we can say, and there's my cat sitting on a mat, ironically, right here, appropriately right here.  And oh, now she's getting off the mat and coming over and squawking at me, telling me, stop talking about me.  In any case, we can say, yes, the image of the cat corresponds to the actual cat.  The image of the mat corresponds to the actual mat.  And there is this relation of the cat being on the map.  that's depicted there in the picture.  The picture depicts what it's a picture of.  Well, the same thing is happening a bit more abstractly in a statement.  We've got some linguistic items that actually depict items in the world.  depict in a different way, not visually depict in the way that the actual image does, but depict nevertheless.  The phrase the cat is going to refer to the cat, it's going to in some sense depict or correspond to the cat.  And similarly with the mat, similarly with the relation of being on.  So when we think about a sentence like this and its structure, we realize it's something like a picture of the way things are in the world.  We can understand the correspondence theory then in a number of different ways.  We can think of a sentence as being true, as Bertrand Russell does, when there is a corresponding fact.  when there is some state of affairs in the world that that sentence corresponds to.  We could think of it in terms of the picture theory, as Wittgenstein does, thinking that the elements of the sentence depict certain elements of reality, just as the elements of an image depict the various things that it's an image of.  When we think further about this picture, too, we can think about this the way Aquinas thinks about it, and also the way that some modern representations, like the discourse representation theory of Hans Kamp, thinks about truth.  There it's not so much a matter of a picture or correspondence to a fact, but instead the same type of relationship, but understood a little bit differently.  The idea there is that there is a function from the sentence to the world.  The sentence maps into the world.  There is a homomorphic embedding, as Kopp puts it, between the elements of the sentence and the elements of the world.  Now, what do I mean by that?  Well, we can embed the sentence into the world, and the way we do that is to think about functions.  There's a function from the cat to, well, the cat.  There is a function from isOn to a certain relationship between the cat, and in this case, the mat.  There's a function between the mat and this thing.  So you might say here, there really is a function that takes us from those linguistic items to certain elements or certain relations, certain qualities, certain positions, states, et cetera, et cetera, in the world.  So, we can think of this in terms of pictures, we can think of it in terms of correspondence to a fact, we can think of it in terms of a mapping, in terms of a function that takes us from a thought or a sentence into the world.  And as long as it's a structure-preserving function, a structure-preserving map, the sentence is true.  If, on the other hand, the cat is not on the mat, let's say the cat is moving across the floor as it was a moment ago, then we can say, well, okay, the cat is in fact not on the mat.  There is still a mapping from the cat to the cat, a mapping from the mat, the words, the mat, to the actual mat in the world.  But then we look for the relation being on, and we realize, well, the cat is no longer on the mat.  And so the sentence is false.  The mapping is in this case not structure-preserving because the relationship expressed there does not correspond any longer to the relationship actually in the world.  Now I said a moment ago that this applies to thought as well as to language.  But here we have to be careful.  A lot of philosophers have thought of the structure of thought and the structure of language as corresponding closely.  Whether or not that's true is a large topic that I can't really talk about here.  But I will say there are a variety of reasons for thinking it's so, but also a variety of reasons for being cautious and worrying some about it.  Why would we think it's true?  Well, we might, like Roderick Chisholm, for example, think of language as reflecting the structure of thought, thinking that the whole point of language is to convey my thoughts to someone else, to communicate my thoughts, and so what I'm doing is trying to find something that is a linguistic, expressible structure that will reflect the structure of my thinking.  And so the structure of thought, you might think, is primary.  Language is built to reflect the structure of thought.  You might also think, as Wilfred Sellers believed, that it goes just the other way around, that we learn to think eventually by thinking in linguistic terms.  Some of our thinking can be imagistic, some of it can be spatial, but a lot of it and our more abstract parts in general, are symbolic.  They use the structure of language in order for us to express our thoughts and to structure our thoughts.  So the structure of thought, from that point of view, is largely following on the structure of language.  Language is developed to communicate with people, and then our thinking starts taking the form of language.  You could also think, as I think Friedrich Nietzsche believes, that The structure of thought and the structure of language are basically different.  They have different purposes.  They're designed for different things.  And there are aspects of our thought that are never quite expressible in language.  So from that point of view, you could say, yeah, there is this structure of thought.  There's this structure of language.  Maybe there's some overlap, but maybe even there, the overlap is not very precise.  And there are aspects of the thoughts that are just not expressible.  There might be other aspects of thinking that are just completely ineffable.  Don't overlap language at all.  And so from that point of view, you could say, hmm, we've got to be careful.  What might be true of language may or may not be true of thought.  In fact, you might think sweepingly, as I think Nietzsche sometimes thinks, it's not true at all of thought.  Even Wittgenstein, the champion of linguistic philosophy , seems to say, look, be very, very careful.  Language often disguises thought.  Language is designed for other purposes.  It's designed to, well, indicate things in the world, to communicate with other people.  Thinking is an internal process.  It happens largely in ways we can't describe.  Do not think that the tool we use for actually doing things in the world corresponds in any way to the structure of what's happening inside the head. ",
