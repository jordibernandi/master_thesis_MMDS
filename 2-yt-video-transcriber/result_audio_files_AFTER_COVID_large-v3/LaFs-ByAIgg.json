            "text": "Okay, this is a video for all of my intellectual friends out there, so if you're the kind of person who really values knowledge and takes pride in your cognitive abilities, this is the video for you.  Women like men who are intelligent.  It's one of the best ways to satiate their hypergamy, to have A lot of knowledge, a sharp sense of humour, a quick mind.  It's appealing to her because if you're really intelligent, she can look up to you and admire you.  It also demonstrates that you're going to be a good provider and a good father to any potential children.  So that's appealing to her on a biological level.  An intelligent man is someone who's capable of making social bonds, of outwitting enemies, of, you know, problem solving in situations and making himself valuable in the group.  All really important skills for providing.  However, being a good provider is only one half of the equation because a woman is not just going to be attracted to you because you have a beautiful brain.  You need to have a beautiful body as well.  If you're an intelligent guy, a woman might want to shack up with you because she realizes on a practical level that that's going to be advantageous to her.  You know, it's going to enhance her survival prospects.  But intelligence in isolation is not enough to stimulate genuine sexual attraction, because sexuality is not cognitive, it's emotional, it's physical.  A woman might admire a man who's really intelligent and logically tell herself that she should find him attractive, but she may be more sexually drawn to a man who's far less intelligent just because of the physicality.  So if you want to really crush it in both aspects of attraction, you need to look at your own relationship with your body.  Now this is not going to be a video where I tell you to go to the gym and get big muscles as though that's some kind of cure-all.  It isn't.  That is far too simplistic because The truth is that a woman's relationship with a male body is a lot more nuanced than that.  Some women do love that bodybuilder, Arnold Schwarzenegger body type, that's true, but there are women who are also attracted to really thin guys who wear skinny jeans.  Now, the research shows that on the whole, women generally prefer a man with muscles, although you can go too far with that regard, but my point is that there's a lot of scope for individual preferences with women.  What I want to talk about in this video is not just the appearance of your body, but more importantly, your relationship with your body, how confident you feel inside your own skin.  That is one factor that is absolutely universally attractive to women, a man who has a really positive and confident relationship with his own body.  What women will not tolerate on skinny guys or muscly guys is a man who is awkward and uncomfortable inside his own body.  Do you remember that kid in school who just... seemed awkward in his body like he couldn't run properly he couldn't throw balls or catch balls and he just seemed uncoordinated?  it's like there was a disconnect between his mind and his body and it's not attractive to women.  that's not who you want to be.  even if you don't have the body type that lends itself naturally to piling on lots and lots of layers of muscles you can still work on your relationship with your body and develop a body confidence that women are going to find attractive.  When I'm talking about a positive relationship with your own body, a lot of it centers around trust, like how much you trust your body and are confident that it's going to do what you want it to do.  The reason that this is important when it comes to attraction is because when a woman sees a man with a lot of body confidence and he's just comfortable.  the way he moves, the way he interacts with the world around him, his body is just a a perfect expression of his mind, she interprets that behavior and that body confidence as indicative that he is going to be a good lover.  This should be obvious to say, but sex is not a cognitive exercise.  If you read some online manual about lovemaking, a guide to lovemaking, and it says you need to thrust every three seconds and change positions every two minutes and kiss her for this long, and you think that following these instructions is going to make you a good lover, you're dead wrong.  Good performance in bed is largely about trusting your body, just letting go and surrendering to your instincts so that the mind is not involved.  It's just a physical bodily experience.  Just in case I haven't made it clear, I'll state it explicitly.  What I'm saying is that improving your relationship with your body and your body confidence will have a direct positive correlation with enhanced lovemaking skills.  So if you want to have a better performance in the bedroom, your work starts long before you get there.  You need to be working now on your relationship with your body.  So what I'm going to do now is go through a number of recommendations that aren't so much geared towards improving the appearance of your body, but about developing that trust and that body confidence.  My number one recommendation for men is to take up a type of martial arts, because not only is this going to have the benefit of improving your muscles and all of that stuff, but it has an explicit focus on quieting the mind and getting you in touch with your body.  It's a spiritual discipline as well as a physical one, and it has the... the consequence of improving the level of trust that you have with your body.  When you're talking to other men or just walking down the street, knowing that your body has the capacity to physically inflict harm and defend yourself is going to be a massive boost to your confidence.  It really helps you trust your body in a very intimate way to know that your body is a weapon and you can use it to keep you safe.  It is difficult to overstate just how big the transformation can be after a man takes up a type of martial arts.  The more time you put in, the more energy you put into it, the better your relationship with your own body becomes.  So whether it's boxing or karate or Brazilian jiu-jitsu, I don't know which one is going to suit you best.  And maybe some people in the comment section have some experience and some wisdom that they can share if people are trying to find a martial arts that suits them.  But I would highly recommend finding one of these and then taking up that discipline.  My next suggestion is sports.  And I would highly recommend any sports that uses the full body and requires some... quick thinking and some agility.  Playing table tennis is better than nothing, but it's mostly just moving your wrists and standing still.  You want something that gives you that full body experience, something that really requires a high level of fitness.  When you play sports at a semi-competitive level, you have to be able to trust your body to do what you tell it to do, to move this way, to be quick, to be strong.  When you see your body react in split-second decisions and be able to catch the ball or kick the ball or do whatever it is, it's a massive boost to your body confidence.  The gym is another good option, and unlike what most people think, this doesn't just have to be about appearances and looking good.  yes, women are attracted to strength.  And so if you've got the abs, you've got the biceps, women are going to find that sexy, no doubt.  But it goes deeper than surface level appearances, because when you put in your time at the gym and you build up a lot of muscle, a lot of bulk, then you become confident in a way that you weren't before, that you're able to lift things and move things.  You know, your body can exert its will on the world around you in a way that you couldn't before.  And that's fantastic for your for your trust.  you know for that relationship with your own body being that well-built guy is going to give you a whole new level of confidence as you move through the world and women will pick up on that confidence and they'll find it very attractive.  my next suggestion is dancing and this one might surprise a lot of people but i'm going to start off by telling you a personal story about myself.  so when i was a younger guy a lot of my body confidence came through playing sports.  i wasn't the tallest guy or the bulkiest but i was really quick and i had great hand-eye coordination.  I really liked fast-paced sports like field hockey, where you had to make split-second decisions and just burst through with strength.  You know, that kind of thing really appealed to me.  But as I got older, the sport became increasingly dangerous, and I began to get nervous that my teeth were going to get knocked out.  And I just, I lost my passion for it. ",
