            "text": "Why is he getting all squirrely and not showing us his hands and just being all weird like that?  Because he's been shopping.  Well, I get that, but still, when officers say get out of the car, he's drunk, is he on something?  Oh, he got a thing going on.  What does that mean?  We have problems.  How's everybody doing?  My name is Anthony Bryan Logan and today we got to talk about the George Floyd body cam footage that has been released to the Internet.  You have 18 minutes of the body cam footage.  It starts from the very beginning where the store owner talking to the police saying, hey, this guy's out there trying to pass a fake bill to the point where they go up to the car.  They're trying to arrest Floyd.  He's resisting.  And then it goes to the point where he's on the ground and his knees on his neck.  Now, I cannot play that here.  Obviously, I can play little points of it throughout the video, but I can't play the entire thing.  If you want to see that, a link will be in the description box below.  You can see the entire footage in full.  But let me get back to it.  So the tape starts with.  The store owner, like I said, he's talking to the police saying, hey, this guy's trying to pass a fake bill.  Now the police go out and George Floyd and two of his friends or acquaintances or whatever are in this black SUV type vehicle.  Floyd's driving and then he has two passengers.  It's a male in the front seat.  It's a female in the back seat.  I think there might've been his coworkers or somebody, somebody that he knew or he may know both of them.  He was giving them a ride.  Now the police talking to everybody in the car, not just George Floyd.  Okay, George Floyd was a guy that they said had the fake bill, but they spoke to the other passengers.  Now the tape starts from what I saw.  Or like the longer one, because you got two different ones.  The 18 minute one has like a different perspective.  And the 18 minute one, he's talking to the passenger.  It's a guy, black male, and he's cool.  Everything is straight.  He's just asking them questions.  The guy's real calm.  It's not escalated.  The police, they're not escalated.  The guy's not escalated.  Everything's pretty much on the up and up.  They just asked him basic questions about what was he doing, where was he going.  He's like, I was trying to get a laptop.  I got my change back.  You can ask the guy.  He was real cool.  And then the officer asked for his ID.  And he got up out of the car, asked, could he reach into his pocket and get his ID?  Officer's like, yeah, sure, go ahead.  He pulled his ID out and then he kind of got not really pushed, but just kind of like guided back into the car to sit down when George Floyd began to act up because one officer was on one side talking to the passenger and the other guy, all the officers on the other side talking to George Floyd.  George Floyd is erratic and talking crazy from the very beginning.  Now, according to the autopsy that I've seen, I think there's at least two autopsies.  One autopsy said that George Floyd did not die as a result of the knee.  The other one said he did.  But I think in both autopsies, they did say that he had fentanyl and methamphetamine in the system, also cannabis weed or whatever.  But most importantly, the fentanyl and the meth.  Now, it looked like the meth was talking when he was in the car talking to the officer.  He's really erratic.  Floyd was not listening to anything.  He was going a mile a minute, just really erratic.  Now, contrast that to the passenger who was calm, cool, and collected.  It was no problem, no nothing.  Everything was good.  Why would the passenger be so calm, cool, and collected and be treated very nicely and very normal-like if George Floyd was not going to be treated that way.  The reason why George Floyd was not treated that way is because he was acting erratically and the officer was trying to get him to calm down.  Now, the officer did draw his gun and told George Floyd to get out because his erratic behavior kind of just, you know, set off a red flag, like, hey, what's going on here?  Something's wrong, get out.  And all throughout the arrest process, trying to get him in a squad car, I'll talk about that in a minute, all throughout the process, they're saying, hey, are you on something?  What's going on?  He's like, no, man, I'm scared, I'm scared.  Several different times the officers trying to guide him to the squad car.  He's falling down like intentionally like he's up walking normally.  He's not like when he got out the car.  He did not appear to have any kind of weakness in his legs.  It's a pretty big strong guy.  He did not appear to have any kind of weakness, but he would just kind of fall down.  on purpose to prevent from going forward.  it was really weird.  you could tell that the drugs were talking and acting for him.  he was not in his right mind.  that was 1000 clear from the tape and again if you want to see that a link will be in the description box below click on it.  check it out.  but anyway They're trying to get him to the squad car.  This is where things really just go totally left.  Well, they had been going left from the very beginning, but the squad car was the beginning of the end, in my humble opinion.  They had him cuffed up after him resisting, and they were trying just to get him to sit in the squad car.  It was weird.  They had him sitting down.  Like, if he would have just sat down, let him close the door, and go to the police station, he'd be alive today, in my humble opinion, but he didn't do that.  They had him sitting down like outside of the car, but in the, on the seat, if that makes any sense.  So his feet were facing out of the door and the door was not closed, but yet he was sitting down on the seat.  Okay.  They're trying to get him to go in the car, close the door up and get, you know, move on.  He's like, let me count to three.  Let me count to three before I get in the car.  I was like, count to three, sir, just get in the car.  What are you doing?  So they are going back and forth for quite a bit.  I say probably about four or five minutes trying to get him just to sit in the car so they can close the door.  He's laying all out with his feet extended.  And George Floyd was a big guy, like 6'4\", 6'5\", or more.  So if you laying with your body extended and you got a big frame, they can't really close the door and get you secure into the vehicle.  So he just did not want to get in the car.  It got to the point where he kind of like torpedoed his body out of the the seat and he was trying to go to the ground.  He was asking specifically, hey man, let me lay down.  Let me lay down.  I want to go on the ground.  I want to go on the ground.  I don't know why he wants to go on the ground.  Maybe he just wants to prevent from going to jail.  He wants to delay jail.  Or like I said, it could have been the drugs talking for him because it didn't make any sense.  Why you want to go on the ground when you could just get in a car and go to where you got to go?  You're talking about, oh, I got claustrophobia.  Claustrophobia?  Really?  Sir, you were just driving in the car.  The space you had in the car is not much more than what you have in the back of a squad car.  The squad car that they had was like an SUV, and so it was a car that you were just in.  I could see if you were driving in some kind of bus or something, and they tried to put you in a Mini Cooper.  Nah.  You had an SUV, they had an SUV, just get in the car, let's go to the station.  They probably just would have gave him some type of detox to get the drugs out of his system and let him go about his business.  It probably wouldn't have been no charge really for the counterfeit bill, not nothing major.  I mean, he could have been on probation or parole, but that would have been something different.  Either way it goes, he was going to go to jail, but like I said, I think the drugs were talking, so... He does not want to go to jail.  He's just saying, let me go on the ground.  Let me count to three, all this, that, and a third.  So he eventually gets his way and he's able to get on the ground because he was just simply not going into the squad car.  Now, that's where the whole knee on the neck thing happened.  And after that, he had died.  Now, also in the video before he got on the ground, he was saying, I can't breathe.  He was saying, I can't breathe while he was struggling, trying to not sit down in the squad car.  No, no.  Take a seat.  I can't breathe.  I can't breathe.  Please.  My wrist.  My wrist, man.  My wrist, man.  Please.  I can't take this.  I can't.  I'm on the ground.  I'm on the ground.  I'm on the ground.  I'm on the ground.  This is before any kind of pressure was applied to his neck.  This is before anything.  All he had on him was the handcuffs behind his back.  And it was him just, you know, worming and squirming around.  Nobody had any kind of pressure on him.  So, you know, he was saying, I can't breathe right there.  And then he said it when he was out there laying down, as was his request.  And that whole knee on the neck thing was protocol in Minneapolis.  OK, they changed it to where it's not protocol anymore.  But that was on the books.  They taught that knee on the neck restraint.  It wasn't a thing that was done out of malicious intent.  And if it was, you got to be able to prove it.  How are you going to prove it when that exact maneuver was in the training book?  It was in the training manual.  The officer who did that, Derek Chauvin, would have done that.  Because he was trying to do it.  And if anyone else did it, although they didn't, they would have been trained as well by what was on the books in Minneapolis.  So to say that he did that and try and hurt the man is going to be really hard to prove.  I don't think that was really the case.  George Floyd simply did not want to get in the squad car.  The officers were trying to get him to go in there.  They were trying to convince him.  Matter of fact, it was a bystander.  I don't know if it might have been a passenger, the female that was in the back.  Somebody that was not an officer said, man, stop resisting.  Like, he was doing too much for no reason.  His passengers, they were cool.  Okay, the guy and the girl, they were just sitting there, just kind of observing what was going on with Floyd acting up.  Nobody... escalated the situation other than George Floyd.  the officers didn't do it the passengers didn't do it the store owner didn't do it it was only George Floyd.  it's unfortunate that he died but I mean whose fault is it really?  there's two autopsies right now.  the first autopsy that came from Hennepin County.  medical examiner says that he had the drugs in his system.  you know the fentanyl and the meth I.
