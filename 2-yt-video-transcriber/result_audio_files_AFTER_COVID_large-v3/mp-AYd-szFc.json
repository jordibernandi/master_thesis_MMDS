            "text": "Yeah, that is Rabbi Tovia Singer, notorious for deceptive, counter-missionary work and coming against the gospel, the good news of Yeshua.  And here he is reacting to Shalanu, the new channel in Israel where the gospel will be preached to Jews in Hebrew.  First thing, as Rabbi Singer knows, You're referring to Jesus in Hebrew.  You use his Hebrew name, which is Yeshua.  You don't call him Jesus.  That's the English name.  You don't call him Jesus.  That's the Greek name.  You don't call him Jesus.  That's the Spanish name.  You don't call him Jesus.  That's the Italian name.  You call him Yeshua.  You don't call him Christ, you call him Mashiach, Yeshua HaMashiach, Jesus the Messiah, because that's what it means.  And if you're speaking Hebrew, you don't call his mother Mary or Maria, you call his mother Miriam, because that was her name.  It's a Jewish book, a Jewish message written to Jewish people first, and then to the rest of the world about the Messiah of Israel and the Savior of the world.  And by the way, the Gospels get in Israeli homes in Hebrew every day.  There is Israeli YouTube channels and others where the message is being shared and different Christian networks where the gospel is being shared.  So this is a typical counter-missionary fear-mongering tactic of Rabbi Singer.  I've got fine relations with different counter-missionaries for years.  We've interacted with integrity.  I cannot say the same about Rabbi Singer, as you'll see his deceptive use of Scripture in a moment.  Here's another clip from Rabbi Singer seeking to sound the alarm about this new TV channel. ",

            "text": "Even those who are not completely observant don't want to stop being Jewish.  They're proud of their Jewish identity in some very important, in a fundamental sense.  So what they do, and this has been very successful.  is they've just marshaled a whole new dictionary.  What they're doing is they're not encouraging Jews to terminate their Jewish faith.  They're not using that kind of language.  What they're doing is they're telling Jewish people, when you accept Yeshua, the Messiah, You're not converting to another religion.  Oh, no.  You're becoming a Messianic Jew, a fulfilled Jew, a completed Jew.  It's the most Jewish thing you could do.  After all, when Jesus was a Jew, his disciples were Jewish.  How could it not be Jewish to believe in Jesus? ",

            "text": "You know what's interesting, though?  First, there's nothing new, okay?  There's nothing that just happened in terms like messianic Jew or completed Jew or being fulfilled Jew, right?  That's a new thing that just happened in the last few months, okay?  But what's fascinating is that in the early church, Jewish believers continued to live as Jews and did so for centuries.  To the point that as the church became more and more Gentile, the Gentile Christians questioned what you're still observing the Sabbath.  They weren't following the traditions of the rabbis, the developing traditions of the rabbis.  They weren't following those, but they were still living as Jews.  Well, why wouldn't they?  Why should they stop?  Sabbath was a gift from God.  So they're not in a legalistic way, but why change it to Sunday?  I mean, they didn't.  This was for centuries.  And now, as a strong Messianic Jewish movement has been greatly recovered, there are many secular Jews.  I know many of them, secular in America, that would have completely lost any sense of Jewish identity or heritage if not for coming to faith in Yeshua.  And then they end up making Aliyah living in Israel, immigrating there, serving there, living there, raising their kids there, raising their grandkids there, not so they can better proselytize, but because this is what they felt to do as Jews, because they recovered their Jewishness by faith in the Jewish Messiah.  But here's a perfect example now of the deceptive use of Scripture, misquotation of Scripture by Rabbi Singer to try to say that all these Israeli Messianics, these Messianic Jews in Israel who are sharing their faith in Yeshua with other Jews, they're just being deceptive.  They're cloaking a Christian message in Jewish garb to trick people.  Listen to what he says. ",

To those who are not under the law, I come as one who is not under the law.  I can become all things to all men, that I may gain some.  Meaning, you could be completely chameleon.  in order to bring people to Christ, whether in pretense or in truth, the Gospels preach, Philippians 1.18.  Just get them.  The ends justifies the means.

            "text": "Well, that's not what Paul says.  And when he says in Philippians 1, whether in pretense or in truth, the gospel is preached, Tovia knows what Paul was saying there.  He said while he was in prison, there were some people who were preaching the message of the Messiah with ulterior motives.  to make it worse for Paul in prison, like this will hurt him if we're out here proclaiming this message.  Others did it in sincerity.  He said, but either way, the message is being preached, whether in pretense or in truth.  So whether people had wrong motivation or right motivation, they were getting the message out.  It's like, you know, you're distributing money to the poor to make me look bad because I'm not doing it.  So you don't have the right motto.  I'm like, hey, I'm glad you're distributing money to the poor to help them.  That's all Paul's saying there.  In 1 Corinthians 9, listen to his words.  For though I'm free from all, I've made myself a servant to all that I might win more of them.  To the Jews I became as a Jew in order to win Jews.  To those under the law I became as one under the law.  Though not being myself under the law, I might win those under the law.  Well, what does he mean?  Well, under the law was a certain posture and a certain legalism of which he spoke, and a certain taking on of traditions he didn't have to take on.  But look at what he says.  To those outside Torah, meaning the Gentiles, verse 21, to those outside the law, like one outside the law, though not being outside God's Torah, but in Messiah's Torah, so that I might win over those outside Torah, to the weak I became weak,  etc.,  He's talking about cultural sensitivity.  He's talking about taking on traditions he did not have to take on.  And when he went to those outside the law, to the Gentile world, he did not have to take on those traditions.  He said, hey, I'm still under God's law in the Messiah.  There is a godly way that I live always, but there are traditions I'll take on that I don't have to to win certain people and take them off when I don't have to to win others.  That's just cultural sensitivity.  But he lived the way he lived with consistency, as we see in the book of Acts, as far as his own obedience to God and living righteously.  But there's no effort for you to really seek things out and understand both issues together.  The desire is to get you afraid and to get you to think that they're missionaries with their deceptive tactics.  Whereas here you've got people in Israel wanting to share their faith, how they live, who they are, their families, their lifestyle, musicians, artists singing their songs.  We want to share this with our people.  And you've got these kind of missionary rabbis and others trying to shut it down.  Interestingly, I got a note from Rabbi Asher Meza.  He's considered controversial by many rabbis because of his views of conversion, his website Torah Judaism.  He sent me something that I found very interesting.  And he said, I think you'll find my take interesting.  So I'm going to play a couple of clips from an Orthodox Jewish rabbi, again, considered controversial by many.  But here's his take on on the counter missionaries and others trying to shut down this new Hebrew-speaking gospel preaching station network in Israel.  This is what Rabbi Meza had to say. ",

So that's actually another reason why most Israelis don't care, which is why this is the medium that was chosen in the first place, because the average Israeli TV watcher, who is in this case being targeted, is secular and irreligious.  Actually, to date, the country is about 90% secular and irreligious, which really begs the question that if a secular Jew is not going to embrace Torah Judaism, wouldn't it be better if he embraced some other ethical religious movement?  I mean, are Jews about to say that we have more in common with atheists than we do with Bible-believing Christians, or in this case, Messianic Jews?  No, this is just another example on how the counter-missionary world has a broken moral compass.  Not to mention that if God TV was allowed to be aired in Israel, this would actually give every Muslim in Israel an alternative to radical Islam.  Because... Are not Christian Arabs more docile than Muslim Arabs? ",

Look, friends, Israel is a secular country, not a religious one.  As a matter of fact, areas where the religious have been given authority in Israeli politics, they have ruined, like, conversion and marriage.  Now we're going to let them decide what people could watch?  I mean\u2014 What if some Christian movement tried to outlaw Chabad being allowed to promote the seven laws in Congress or the United Nations?  You would have hundreds of lawyers yelling that it violates the rights that that country affords them.  Double standard, no?  Unless you're from modern day Israel not being a democracy anymore.  Again, when 90% of the Jews are not religious.  Because if Israel is not a theocracy or a religious monarchy...
