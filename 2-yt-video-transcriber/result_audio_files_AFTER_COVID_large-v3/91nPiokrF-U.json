You're going to be the one who leads this effort.  If I'm elected and I'm coming for you and gun manufacturers, I'm going to take you on and I'm going to beat you.  Says you cannot have 20, 30, 40, 50 clips in a magazine with 100 clips in it.  100 clips.  bullets in it and the number of clips in a gun banned and hell.  if you need 100 clips and 30 clips in a weapon then you shouldn't be hunting man.  you're dangerous said jill.  if there's ever a problem just walk out on the balcony here or walk out put that double barrel shotgun and fire two blasts outside the house.  you don't need an ar-15.  if you agree with me Go to Joe 30330 and help me in this fight.  Thank you very much. ",
