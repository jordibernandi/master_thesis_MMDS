            "text": "This is for the Billy Badasses that always find fault whenever in fact go on formation.  They got a hundred things to say.  Nothing positive.  They don't focus on the positive.  They always try to focus on the negative.  Nick picking like some little kids trying to find fault with every little thing.  instead of acting like grown men.  Number one, they're trying to say NFAC is not a militia because NFAC gets permits for their formations.  NFAC is doing things legal.  The minute we do things illegal, they're quick to call us thugs, Gangsters and criminals.  But when you do things legal, they got a problem with that.  So you know what?  They got it twisted.  We're not playing by their rules.  We play by our own rules.  Unapologetic.  If they don't like it, they can lump it.  In fact, functions within the criterias of the law.  The law say get permits, announce yourself before you come in unless you're going to be viewed as an invading force.  That's what the Grand Master do.  He give due notice.  The brother get on the ground, check the terrain, check the routes.  so that he's able to get in fact in and whoever else support in fact get them in and out safely so whoever has something to say about that they can lump that.  another next point that they try to bring out or next fall is, in fact, avoid confrontations.  Man, we're not getting no points.  In fact, it's not getting no points trying to get at anybody.  In fact, it's not thugs and gangsters.  They're not criminals and hoodlums.  Brothers is moving off of self-defense, not offense.  It's a self-defense organization.  Global organization.  Self-defense.  The brothers and sisters is not looking for problems, but if problems come, they're more than prepared to handle them.  But they're not out there looking for problems.  They do not train.  How the hell y'all know that the brothers don't train?  You know, when you assume, you make an ass out of yourself.  Don't judge a book by its cover.  If you don't know, zip it up.  Don't assume, talk about these.  brothers is clustered and in the military you don't do this and in the military you don't do that.  You see a combat mission going on?  Are brothers in the battlefield?  Or are they on a street in a city?  Trying to reach one point to the next.  This is not no op.  Brothers is in a formation.  Making it to a set destination.  It's no secret.  Unless y'all planning an ambush.  brothers don't train.  You don't really want to find out, do you?  Don't get it twisted.  Number four, real militias use real body armor and heavy duty weapons.  Y'all just nitpicking, nitpicking, nitpicking.  Those brothers and sisters got body armor.  And it's real.  You can believe what you want.  Who are you to try to convince?  Ain't nobody trying to convince you.  You believe what you want.  Oh, why is the Grandmaster Jay?  and why are they wearing pink jackets, pink vests and all that?  Man, listen, man.  Why is you worried about that?  Why are you worried about that?  That is none of your concern.  Worry about what you do.  It's like all these criticisms, like y'all trying to get feet off of this man's energy.  You trying to get ratings off of hitting on in fact.  Trying to keep your name up there.  Angry Viking.  Black Scout survival.  Please.  Stay in your lane.  Number five.  Grandmaster J talks rough to his troops and doesn't permit no one else to talk.  If you're in the military, the CO does the talking.  Regular troops don't talk unless they ask permission to talk.  This brother is his vision.  Therefore, he's the one who's qualified to speak.  If you're not qualified to speak and you're on post, what you doing?  talking?  That's not your position.  You're on post.  Keep your eyes open.  Secure the perimeter and secure what you need to secure.  Leave the talking to the people who qualify.  If the brother wants you to speak, the brother's going to empower you to make a statement or whatever.  If he doesn't, he has it under control. ",
