            "text": "we are going to take some power bitters.  And I'll leave a link at the bottom of this video so you know where to get this from.  But if you guys saw before, this one looks like power bitters.  It helps you lose weight and heal the body naturally.  Power bitters are a unique combination made with black seed.  It's very powerful to promote good health and fight diseases in the body.  You wanna read the things that you can take power bitters for?  So you can take it for piles, constipation, hemorrhoids, strokes, hypertension, general disability, bareness, low sperm count, infertility in men, skin diseases, poor eyesight, fibroids, diabetes, menstrual disorder, fever, malaria, anemia, and etc.  All right, so this one, it has some of the herbal compositions of it.  It's cinnamon, cascara, mahogany, garlic, ginger, neem tree, palm palm leaves, golden seal, black seed.  And the suggested dosage for adults, we have two tablespoons daily after meals.  And this is a product of Ghana.  So we'll go ahead and open this and tell what we watched last night.  So last night we had watched Left Eye while she was in Honduras before her death.  And so her, a lot of friends and family members, they were able to take this.  Now I'm kind of leery about using this because a couple of the family members.  they were actually vomiting it up afterwards.  So apparently it doesn't taste well.  so that's why we have these cups of tea in front of us to kind of drink it afterwards.  So I don't know how I let her talk me into this.  So since she will I think that's well.  All right.  So two tablespoons.  All right.  So I'm just guessing where it's going to be.  That looks about right.  Two tablespoons.  I'll give you some more.  You want the big cup?  No, no, no.  That's all you.  I'll pour you some more.  All right.  There you go.  You think I should put a little bit more or keep it?  Let's just keep this.  Okay, so here we go.  We're going to do this first.  You ready?  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Toes to our health.  Being healthy.  It's not bad.  Not bad, but... Oh, God, I don't feel it.  It's not bad.  Okay.  But yeah, you definitely got to chase it, man.  You have to chase it.  I taste a lot of the ginger and a little bit of the cinnamon.  There's just like the aftertaste.  Tastes like earwax.  Yes.  Y'all know what earwax tastes like?  Yeah, of course.  Y'all been sticking your hands inside your ears.  Well, every child has done it.  Yes, and you went down tall.  You didn't try any bitters.  You want some bitters?  Want me to stop recording?  No, do it all the time until you have some bitters.  Ooh, it's still on my tongue.  Alright, so now you gotta do this after every meal.  So, this bottle is about $20.  I'll put a link in the description.  And these things are something that you can incorporate?  I don't know.  I got to kind of see at the end of the day.  But it's definitely something that there's an aftertaste still.  You know what it tastes like?  When you have an empty stomach and you grow up.  That's what it tastes like.  It tastes like that.  When you have an empty stomach and you grow up.  And you can't brush your teeth.  That's what it tastes like.  Yeah.  So yeah, thank you to my big sister for trying bitters with me.  And thank you to my son, the cameraman.  Thank you so much.  Like, subscribe, share.  And I will try to do my daily, I'll try to do like one bitters dosage on Instagram stories.  So make sure you follow me on my other social media platforms.  And I'll see you on the next video. ",
