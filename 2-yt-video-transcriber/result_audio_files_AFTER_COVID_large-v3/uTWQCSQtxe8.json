            "text": "gracious god help us remember properly that we might live faithfully.  amen there's a scripture rolling in all of your listeners in hebrews chapter 10 verses 30 verse 39 that says but we do not belong to those who shrink back and are destroyed but to those who have faith and are saved.  and then it says in chapter 11 of hebrews now faith is the confidence of what we hope for and the assurance of the evidence about the things we do not see.  I've been thinking about this and distribute eulogy to Chadwick Boseman and Roland.  in a real sense, he didn't shrink back and neither can we.  As I've listened to the last 30 minutes, he didn't shrink back and neither can we.  One rendering of his name Chadwick literally means the warrior's town.  The name Chadwick literally means the warrior's town.  So his very name before he ever played Black Panther was to be named a warrior.  And as a warrior, a righteous warrior, a committed warrior, he didn't shrink back from disease.  If you look at it, 39 years old, four years diagnosed and for four years battling.  He did not shrink back from the disease.  He kept moving, kept producing, kept believing, kept living, kept acting, kept being a thespian, kept moving in the theater.  He did not shrink back from the disease.  We are not of those who shrink back.  He didn't shrink back from his destiny.  From his destiny.  You know, life is really about destiny.  Coming to a place where you know you've been born for such a time as this.  You've been born for this role.  You've been born to do this.  And life, when you understand that, is not really about how long, but committing an assignment and being faithful to that assignment.  And when you do that, and it is coupled with not just being for yourself, but for others, then indeed our living is not in vain.  And Brother Bozeman's living was not in vain.  He didn't shrink back from this disease.  He did not let it dominate him.  And he did not shrink back from his destiny.  But then, and your just previous speaker, Brother Clark, helped solidify this in my spirit.  he did not shrink back from his dedication to deliver a message dramatically.  When you look at Brother Chadwick Boseman's life and look at how he took on black male figures, both historically and fictional, every one of them had a message not just for the movie, but literally for the movement.  Every one of them had something to say, not just on the screen, but something to say that literally can save us as a people.  I want to remind us of some of those in these last few minutes.  Can you hear Brother Bozeman when he embodied Thurgood Marshall?  And in that movie, one of the lines he he dramatically presented was, the Constitution was not written for us.  We know that.  But no matter what it takes, we're gonna make it work for us.  And from now on, we claim it as our own.  That wasn't just a line for a movie.  He brought that line to life in such a way that we need to hear it right now in the movement.  Maybe the Constitution wasn't written for us.  Maybe a lot of things that have been done in this country weren't done for us, but we're going to make it work for us and we're going to claim it for our own.  Thank you, Brother Bozeman, for bringing that to life.  Remember that other line in the movie, Marshall, when he said, I wouldn't be here if I didn't think we could win.  It was a dialogue between him and the Jewish lawyer that was wondering what was going on and why would he come there just him by himself, do you think we can win?  He said, I wouldn't be here.  And then there was this conversation between him and the man who had been falsely accused.  I wouldn't be here if I didn't think I could win.  My, how we need to hear that when we're standing for struggle and we're standing for us right.  There's nothing, there's no need to fight if we already believe we're defeated.  But Brother Chad, we brought this to life.  I would not be here if I didn't think we could win.  That's why BLM is in the streets.  That's why people are marching because they think, they believe, they believe, they believe we can win.  And then some of the lines that was said to him, like Black Panther, I'm sure my brother Freddie Haynes would deal with this one, show them who you are.  Show them who you are.  There comes a time that you have to do that.  And then that other one, when in the movie Black Panther, The sister says to him, you get to choose what kind of king you want to be.  We need to hear that in our lives.  You get to choose, Roland.  I get to choose.  We all get to choose what kind of king we're going to be, what kind of person we're going to be, what we're going to do with our lives.  And then, you know, we have to hear how he brought the king, King T'Chula, to life.  And I thought about these last three lines.  One, Wakanda will no longer live in the shadows.  We cannot, we must not, we will work to be an example of how we must work to be brothers and sisters on the earth and how we should treat each other.  My God, we need that example.  We cannot stay in the shadows, those of us who know what's right.  cannot stay in the shadows.  And he brought that line, Brother Boseman brought that line, Brother Chadwick brought that line to life, playing a fictional character, but saying to us what we need to have in this real life.  Then he said, one line.  he said, today, we don't just fight for one life, we fight for them all.  Can you hear that?  Can you hear that, those of you that are listening?  When we're in the street now, whether it's fighting for Brother Blake or whether it's fighting for the person that died, because they did not have what they needed on a job that was made lethal because of COVID and inept responsibility to deal with those things that should have been dealt with.  When we stand, we're not just standing for one life, we fight for them all.  And then the King said, King T'Challa, in times of crisis, the wise build bridges while the fool build barriers.  Oh goodness, if we could just lift that up as Brother Chadwick did and put that before the nations.  The fools build walls.  The fools build barriers.  Don't follow the fools.  The fools try to keep us one from another.  The fools try to separate us black and white.  The fools, the fools, but the king, when he lifted it up, when he dramatically presented that, said in times of crisis, the wise build bridges.  Are the fools be a barrier?  The last one is, you know, in the movie, when he's thrown over the cliff, it looks like the new king has come.  He has a lot of bitterness.  And then T'Chula finds his way back.  A fisherman picks him up and then they are able to revive him.  And he comes back for that second battle.  And he says, I never yielded.  The guy says, no, you're no longer king.  You're no longer king.  But he says, I never yielded.  And all of us need to hear that, and all of us need to say that sometimes.  We don't know what we're going to face, like him, cancer.  We don't know heart issues.  We don't know racism.  We don't know what.  But there's something about living when you say, but I never yielded.  I may have been knocked down, but I never yielded.  Weapons may have been formed against me, but they didn't prosper.  I have not yielded.  I still walk by faith.  I am not of those who shrink back unto destruction.  Thank you, Brother Boseman.  even in that fictional character, the Panther, to remind us that there's a place in life where we must say, I've never yielded, beaten, broken, knocked down, but I've never yielded.  And you never yielded.  He never yielded.  And so he's gone from us now, but his spirit is yet with us.  And while all of those that I just spoke were lines on screen, lines in dramatic production, here's one that was not on the lips of a character, but on his own.  Brother Chadwick said, when I stand before God, at the end of my life, I would hope that I would not have a single bit of talent left.  And I could say I used everything you gave me.  Let what he said and did be what we say and do.  When we stand before God at the end of our lives, let us hope that we don't have a single talent left, that we've spent it all in the cause of love and justice and humanity, that we used everything God gave us.  And you know what, Roland, that's the best way to honor.  That's the best way.  to honor somebody that you love, that died, that lived a powerful life is imitation.  It's imitation.  And so let us imitate him.  Let us imitate him and give it all, give everything we have, every bit of talent we have while we're here to make this world better.  And Roland, I close here with this, something you and I know well, and I can hear it in the life of brothers.  Brother Chadwick, out of the night that covers me, black as a pit from pole to pole, I thank whatever gods may be for my unconquerable soul.  In the fell clutches of circumstance, I have not winced nor cried aloud.  Under the bludgeoning of chance, my head is bloody but unbowed.  Beyond this place of wrath and tears looms but the horrors of the shade, and yet the menace of the years, whatever that menace is, finds and shall find me.  unafraid.  It matters not how straight the gate, how charged with punishment the scroll.  I am the master of my fate, and I am the captain of my soul.  Rest, sweet prince, and we'll see you in the morning. ",
