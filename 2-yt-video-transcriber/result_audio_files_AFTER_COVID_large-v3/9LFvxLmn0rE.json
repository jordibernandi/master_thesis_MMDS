            "text": "Hey there, Internet.  My name's Luxander.  Super Tuesday was this week, and I don't want to talk about it.  You already saw the title, so let's just do this.  Super not clickbait, by the way.  I feel like most people already know what a furry is, and I also feel like I'm personally not, like, qualified to explain what a furry is.  Uh, basically, it's a person who has an affinity with an animal, and sometimes they have a, uh, sort of persona, or fursona, if you will, that they express themselves with, and sometimes that involves having a suit, and I'm sure that anybody has a passing awareness with the idea of people in fursuits.  This is not explicitly a sexual thing, not even most of the time a sexual thing necessarily, For a lot of people, it seems like it's a personal expression sort of deal.  Again, I don't know a whole lot about it.  I've been having conversations with furries recently on my Twitch channel, actually.  I also follow a few furries on Twitter.  I've personally never really familiarized myself with the furry community.  I don't know most of their words.  I'm sure that most of us have heard of Yiffing, but for a long time, that was basically everything I knew about the furry community.  And even to this day, as I'm about to tell you that I might be a furry, I don't, I don't actually know a whole lot about it.  I'm sorry.  That's kind of my familiarity with furries as a community, and I guess I will tell you now about why, why, why I feel, why am I making this, why.  Through exposure, I suppose, I have divorced myself from the idea that being a furry is like a weird kink or like a sex thing, or even if it is a sex thing, like that's, I'm super happy for those people, but that's not why I'm interested in it.  I'm kind of turned off by that aspect of it.  I'm, you know, there's like cartoon... Prawn, I'm fine with it, you know, like Anthro, it's fine, whatever.  It's just not my personal thing.  as far as like a thing that I would want to do, okay?  So I'm more interested in furries as this sort of self-expression sort of thing.  And I was actually asking, again, on my Twitch.  I've been doing livestreams and I have a couple furries who follow me and talk to me in the chat.  I would actually love to maybe get one of them on stream to talk to me about this, but I am someone who has sort of mild affinity for a certain type of fictional animal, and this is like the first time I've kind of publicly talked about it.  I'm not really worried about anything that any of you could possibly say to me, because honestly, like, what could you do to hurt me at this point?  But basically, like, I have a loose affinity with the dragons, and like the concept of dragons, and the, like, lore involved with it, like, I, I would say I'm a low-key Otherkin, Dragonkin sort of thing, right?  And, like, like, low-key, and by, like, I don't even know anything about the Otherkin community, I don't want people to think this is, like, a big deal, it's, I'm not making, like, a big coming-out deal about it, right?  Like, this is, like, a relatively minor thing in my life, it's just a personality thing for me, like, I, you know, it's, like, that's just, it's, like, a part of my personality, for sure.  But I don't imagine that I am another species of animal.  Okay, calm down, please.  But I have this sort of, if I was a spiritual person, I would say like a spiritual affinity with the concept of dragons, like Western idea of dragons.  So with that being just a thing that's been true about me for a long time, I am sort of now... interested in the possibility of being like, what if I, what if I have, what if I have fursona?  I actually put up a poll on Twitter a while ago, like about a month ago maybe, that was like, am I, uh, what's my fursona?  Is it like a wolf or a fox or a dragon or some other one?  And like, you can respond in the comments.  I had a couple people suggest ones to me that were not part of my original list, like someone suggested coyote to me, and their reasoning for that was actually very complimentary.  And then I found out that coyote is actually not that uncommon of a fursona.  I was adding in the furry animals in that because it's, like, weird to me to have, um, like, scaly is a, like, so a scaly is a type of furry, but it's if your animal is, like, a lizard.  I wouldn't necessarily want to have a suit that was a scaly, like, it seems to me like more appealing to have a fuzzy one, okay?  But, as I have thought about this some more, generally, like, as I've been thinking about it more, I'm just kind of thinking about leaning into it.  Like, what if I just lean into, I'm a furry now, I'm a scaly now, like... it's a thing.  I think it would be strange to have an anthro dragon persona.  Like, would you call that a fursona?  I don't, I assume that it's also just called a fursona because a scaly is still a furry, they're just a specific type of furry.  So I guess I kind of imagine my relationship with it as being more shapeshifty.  So like, instead of having an anthro persona, I imagine more like the dragon version of me is just a dragon, In the same sense that, like, if you ever played World of Warcraft, there's dragons, like, that are intelligent and can, like, speak, you know?  And they just, like, turn into a humanoid.  And then they walk around with- and have, like, their mouth and everything normal.  and then they can turn back into a dragon.  Okay, so that's kind of more like what I imagined.  Does that still qualify as a furry, though?  I don't actually know.  Is it just that you have to have, like, this sort of connection?  Anyway, so, like, speaking about there being people in my Twitch chat, I... Apparently, there are some furries who are furries because they are otherkin.  which it would kind of like fall- I would sort of fall into that category where like I wouldn't necessarily be a furry if it wasn't for the fact that I have this like sort of otherkin-like feelings.  I would like to tell you what I- what I sort of think my my person would be.  So tell me, first of all, in the comments, if you know the truth, if you know the truth about this, whether sort of the shape-shifting, like, either I'm a humanoid or I'm a dragon, does that qualify as being a furry?  if you are, like, if your intention is to be like, that's me in my, that's my brain in that body, right?  Or does it have to be an anthro thing?  Because I could still make that work.  It would just be weirder to me.  Like it would be less how I imagine myself.  Like if I were to say I imagine myself as a dragon, it would not be. ",
