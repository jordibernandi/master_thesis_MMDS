            "text": "So the night of the Op, there was tons of jubilation and there was also some stuff that happened that created quite a bit of fear.  We were able to rescue nine girls.  Eventually it became ten, which was amazing.  Just the human interaction when you get to witness someone receiving their freedom is incredible.  As the evening went on, though, it quickly became apparent to us that our safety was in jeopardy.  In fact, Sprint confirmed that the traffickers were actually hunting for us.  And we began to fear for our safety a little bit, especially for the safety of the women.  We didn't have their passports, so we couldn't even get them out of the country when we necessarily wanted to.  And I happened to just kind of grab my phone at a quiet time, and I noticed that Tim had made a post requesting for prayer.  He didn't give a lot of details, but he said, you know, one of our operations, they've hit some snags.  It was an amazing rescue, but there's some things that they need to overcome.  And I can't describe the peace that I felt as I scrolled through the comments that it was a very early morning as I read and knew that people were praying about us, praying for us, thinking about us.  I'm just so grateful.  Sometimes we wonder, is he listening?  Is he there?  And I want everyone to know that in that moment, all of us felt the presence of God.  That despite extreme safety concerns, we knew everything would be okay.  The girls felt comfort.  eventually we retrieved their passports.  And it's because of those prayers that were offered.  And so I just from the bottom of my heart, I want to say thank you for taking the time to plead for people that you didn't even know.  Thank you so much. ",
