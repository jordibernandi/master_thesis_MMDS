            "text": "hey guys welcome back for today's video where i want to run through a map projection based solely on the polls on where things currently stand between challenger democrat joe biden and current incumbent republican president donald trump.  now we actually don't have polls from every single state and that's to be expected because some of these states are pretty safe one way or the other.  so you don't necessarily need much in the way of polling to figure out where things are going to be going.  but we actually do have polls from the vast majority of these states.  What I'm going to do is go from least to most competitive of the polling averages from those states.  And then the ones that we have unfilled out at the end, I'm going to be putting either in the Democrats or Republicans camp based on whether it's safe for Biden or Trump.  So starting off here, just going to go through row by row with the polls that we have.  And starting off here, West Virginia, very solid for Trump, whereas Massachusetts and California are solid for Joe Biden.  the blue part of the pie graphs are of course for biden and then the red part is for trump.  so you can kind of see how things are playing out in the polls from these respective states.  so starting off there with west virginia and then california as well as massachusetts going to the blue side with west virginia going red.  And then the next row we have New York, Maryland, and Washington going blue.  New York as well as Maryland's 10 electoral votes, Washington's 12, whereas in that row we had Oklahoma going red.  And then moving up to the next set here, we have New Jersey and Connecticut going blue up there in the east to northeast region.  14 electoral votes from New Jersey and then Connecticut is seven.  And then the next two states down there in the southeast, we have Alabama and Tennessee going red.  So we have Tennessee there as well as Alabama, 11 and nine electoral votes.  The next row, a couple of red results here.  North Dakota as well as Kentucky.  North Dakota just three electoral votes, Kentucky eight.  And then Delaware just three electoral votes and Colorado nine going over to Biden.  Of course, Biden was the former senator from the state of Delaware.  And then Colorado has been an area that's been trending pretty consistently over to the Democrats and an interesting Senate race going on there.  That's looking like one that the Democrats can potentially flip in 2020.  Moving up to the next section, we have Indiana and Kansas both going red.  The six electoral votes there from Kansas and 11 from Indiana, with Virginia and New Mexico going blue.  Five electoral votes from New Mexico, 13 from the state of Virginia.  And then the next line up, some more southeastern states, Mississippi and South Carolina going red.  South Carolina has nine electoral votes, Mississippi six.  And then Maine and New Hampshire up there in the northeast, both going blue.  Each of them have four electoral votes.  And for the purposes of this video, I'm just going to be keeping all of Maine blue and then all of Nebraska red.  They do things a little bit different where they do statewide as well as specifically congressional districts to divvy up their electoral votes.  And in Maine, the second congressional district is typically in just a regular election, more likely to go red.  Whereas in Nebraska, that second congressional district, basically a true toss up can go either way.  But just for the purposes, I'm just going to be doing it statewide in this instance.  Moving up to the next set here.  Now we're getting into some really competitive states where we have Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota all there in the Midwest.  Key states to win if you're going to pick up the Electoral College victory.  And Biden is currently ahead in the average of the polls in those states.  And then the last state in that line was Montana going red.  And Montana is definitely a state to keep an eye on in 2020, especially because they have a Senate race that's likely to be highly competitive between the Democratic governor and the incumbent Republican senator vying for that spot.  And then we have Missouri going red.  nevada going blue missouri's 10 electoral votes nevada's six.  missouri has been trending more towards the republicans whereas nevada and a lot of these other southwestern states been trending more towards the democrats.  and then we have florida and arizona.  these are actually two states that i think out of all of the democratic candidates that we had running in the primary.  biden likely to do the best in these areas because he does well among older voters for a democrat and there's a That can potentially push Biden across the finish line in those areas.  So going to be filling in those key and pivotal battleground states there for Biden.  And then we have Utah.  Actually pretty competitive and close here in the most recent data that we got, but still Trump with a slight lead.  Texas also with a slight lean over there towards Trump.  Two states that the Republicans obviously have to win.  Traditionally very red states, although Texas is getting a bit more competitive as the years go on.  Pennsylvania slightly over to Biden with Iowa basically a coin flip there as well as Pennsylvania being right there to coin flip as well as the next handful of states that we're going to be looking at here.  So Pennsylvania blue, Iowa red.  And then wrapping things up with the states that we have data on, we have North Carolina slightly blue, Ohio slightly red, and then Georgia slightly blue in this instance.  So filling that out there.  And then that gets us to a point where we're at 309 to 156, but the rest of the states are either safe to the left or the right.  So going to be running through that.  We have Rhode Island as going blue, District of Columbia going blue, as well as Vermont.  And then we have Illinois blue, Arkansas red, Louisiana red, Nebraska red, South Dakota red, Wyoming red, Idaho red, and then Oregon blue, Alaska red, and Hawaii blue to finish things off.  So that gets us to a point just strictly based on the data and the polls that we have access to.  We have the Democrats here with Joe Biden looking really strong and comfortable in this current point in time, or at least this snapshot of where the polls are at and all across these competitive states.  You have Biden there at 350 electoral votes, Trump at 188.  But none of this is set in stone.  Things can change over the course of time.  When you get an aggregate of the polls and you have more polls from these specific states that are in the battleground range, then you can kind of get a sense at where things might be headed.  But again, this is a very fluid situation.  There's still many months to go.  So if you're on the Democrat side and supporting Joe Biden, just because the data is looking really good at this point does not mean it will hold and continue to be that way throughout the process.  So I'm going to be continuing to update and track these things as we work our way through the next five or so months until we actually get to election day.  So I appreciate you guys stopping by, consider subscribing, and I'll catch you back here next time. ",
