            "text": "Shalom everyone, this is Amir Tsarfati, and I wanted to share with you a few thoughts regarding all the craziness that is going on all around the world.  And honestly, it's nothing less than craziness.  I mean, the Bible says that when the Antichrist is going to be revealed, then God will send strong delusions to people.  It seems to me that many of them are already super delusional.  Look, we are already seeing the devastating results of the chaos, the mayhem, and the lawlessness that is going on in America and, quite frankly, is spreading all around the world.  we can see already the results of the mayor's and the governor's calling to defund police and almost causing people to completely not trust the police and at the same time not allowing police to go into certain places.  I know that there's already a manufacturing company that has been in Minnesota for many years, since 1987, and they decided to leave the city.  This company, the owner said that he can't trust public officials who allowed his plan to burn during these recent riots.  And he also said that they don't care about my business.  In fact, and guess who is losing from all of this?  Mostly the Black community in the city.  If that's not enough, we already talked yesterday that one of the bloodiest days in the history of Chicago, at least in the last 60 years, took place in the last few days where 18 murders in less than 24 hours of all black people, crazy.  I mean, again, I'm thinking to myself, this is not black lives matter.  This is black lives don't matter when they allow the gangsters to rule where they're actually inciting people against the police.  Now, if you think this is the end of the craziness, you're wrong.  George Floyd, a convicted felon, and someone who definitely was brutally killed.  And nobody denies that that was the most horrible thing.  But to have him getting this type of funeral where you're talking about horse-drawn funeral coach, and people are acting like he's a saint.  Unbelievable, and at the same time, nobody talks about David Dorn, a 77-year-old retired St.  Louis police captain who was shot.  Ladies and gentlemen, he was shot.  This man was shot and killed on June 2nd by looters in his televised funeral.  Where is the televised funeral of this guy?  Of course, nobody wants to talk about it because only few or certain black lives matter to them.  If you think that the craziness ended there, you're way wrong, ladies and gentlemen.  A day after the 76th anniversary to the D-Day, the invasion into Europe by the Brits and the Americans.  that ended up basically World War II.  A day after the 76th anniversary, Winston Churchill's statue was vandalized by those crazy progressive lunatics.  And that's not enough.  London's mayor, listen to that, London's mayor announced on Tuesday that more statues of imperialist figures could be removed from Britain's streets after protesters knocked down the monument of a slave trader.  as the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis continues to spark protests.  Look, next thing, Queen Victoria will be removed from Britain.  What do you think happened in those days?  They used to trade with slaves.  It's part of history.  Not everything in history is great and wonderful, but the way they looked at things then, There were also black people who owned black slaves, believe it or not.  Look, the Bible talks about slaves and owners.  That was the reality of those days.  And when the Bible says that in Christ there is no master and there is no slave, that means that they used to be masters and slaves.  The Bible says in Christ there is no female nor male.  Well, there are females and males, but in Christ they're just the same.  In Christ there is no Jew, no Gentile.  Of course there are Jews and Gentiles, but they are the same in Christ.  So these were realities you cannot deny, you cannot erase from your history.  You cannot try to change your history.  But by the way, if you think the craziness ended up there, no.  The National Football League Commissioner, Roger Goodall, Goodell released a statement on Friday on behalf of the league signifying we were wrong on how they handled the players' protest of kneeling during the national anthem.  And he apologized.  He's basically saying everybody can kneel down.  We were wrong to say that he was wrong.  No, no, he can kneel down.  How crazy can you be?  How crazy?  How blinded can you be?  But by the way, do you think the craziness?  Of course not.  I know it's crazy enough, but no, it's not.  Ladies and gentlemen, the US Civil War epic, Gone with the Wind, has been dropped from HBO Max, the streaming service that recently launched by Warner Brothers as a rival to Netflix.  But why?  After protest over its depiction of slavery.  It's from the Civil War, and there was slavery.  They say that the move followed an article in the LA Times by John Ridley, Oscar-winning scriptwriters, basically that described the movie as a film that, when it is not ignoring the horrors of slavery, pauses only to perpetuate some of the most painful stereotypes of people of color.  Guys, are we out of our mind?  Look, God doesn't need to give people strong delusions.  Honestly, they're already delusional.  This is craziness.  And when I say all of that, I also want to tell you that I wish it ended up in America, but it's not.  Look, whatever is going on in America, America is the leader of the free world.  Everybody's looking up to America.  Hollywood sets the tone when it comes to movies.  The music sets the tone, anything that comes from it.  Look, let's face it, whatever the American president says, it's all over the world.  And in reality, The policies in the U.S.  or of the U.S.  are determining a lot of what is going on elsewhere around the world.  They say that Iran is now getting ready for a war with America just because they see that America is weak right now.  They see that there's so much chaos and that's the right time to do it.  No, all I'm trying to say is that I, as a leader of a ministry called Behold Israel, I better look at what's going on in America because it is right now, at the moment, a U.S.  president that is going to give the blessing for an Israeli sovereignty on pieces of our ancestral homelands that nobody allowed us to have sovereignty over until now.  The German foreign minister just landed in Israel to make sure we're not... imposing sovereignty over our settlements in Judea and Samaria and the Jordan Valley.  The Germans are going nuts.  Don't do it.  They all want to hold on to this whole Palestinian lie because that's the lie they all bow down to.  That's the God they all bow down to.  Invented nation, invented reality, invented... Look, you don't have to go that far.  This is not something you have to go to the Civil War.  It's not in the 1700s or 1800s.  This is something you have to go back to the 1800s, to the 1900s.  It's not too far.  Ladies and gentlemen, there was no Palestinian nation, and they now try to shove that... down your throat that there is something like that.  No, there isn't.  There was a Jewish nation.  There's a Jewish state.  There was a Jewish state.  There are Jewish archaeological remains of Jewish history.  And it's simply craziness.  I just want you to understand that in the midst of all this craziness and in the midst of all this delusion and all this complete I would say brainwash that so many people are going through right now.  We can find so much comfort that this book, the Bible says, you know, heaven and earth will pass, but my word will stand.  I mean, the flower fades, the grass withers, but my word will stand forever.  This cannot change, will not change.  So whatever is written here in this book is the only thing I can trust.  I don't trust politicians.  I don't trust the media.  I don't trust whatever is going around right now simply because they always change their minds and try to change history and try to change rhetorics and try to change everything around us.  But I can tell you there are several amazing, beautiful promises to all of us.  Also, there are several horrific descriptions of what is about to come.  And I want you to understand that so far everything that this book said, so far everything has been fully fulfilled in the most accurate way ever.  Do you understand, folks?  You cannot trust anything but the promises of God.  I want to encourage you because for the believer, there are wonderful promises.  The promise that soon we're out of here.  The promise of the soon redemption of our body from this world.  The promise of us getting the rewards in heaven from Christ according to our faithfulness.  The promise that we will return with Him.  The promise that we will be away from the Great Tribulation, the seven years of crazy, crazy, crazy stuff that is going to fall here in this world.  The promises that we will reign with Him and rule with Him.  The promises that we will have everything new, everything new.  Look, we have a new heart.  We will have a new body.  We will have a new mindset.  We are new creations.  We have the New Testament.  We have new heavens and new earth.  The New Jerusalem is about to... He will make all things new.  We have wonderful promise.  But to the rest of the world, there are horrific descriptions in this book, not based on anybody's delusion or anybody's great imagination.  Based on, listen to this, The revelation of the Creator of the heavens and the earth to a man called John while he was in the island of Patmos.  Look, a revelation.  What is a revelation?  It means that God knows that it's going to happen.  It means that God knows.  knows that the things will take place.  It's not.  they might take place.  They may take place.  It could easily deteriorate to that.  No, no, no, no.  These things lead to the journalists.  These things lead to the politicians.  They think that it might and it can and it should.  No, we don't.  We're not there.  We know.  that these things will happen.  We know that there is going to be a false peace.  We know that there's going to be an Antichrist.  We know that the people will be so much afflicted by the things that God is going to send upon them because they rejected the love of the truth that was able to save them.  We know of the Horrific catastrophes that we know are through the seven trumpets and the seven bowls.  And we just know that things are going to happen.  Look, none of us will ever be able to stop the Antichrist from rising.  None of us will ever be able to stop Ezekiel's war from taking place.  None of us will ever be able to stop the judgment of God over the world during those seven years.  You cannot stay in heaven and not join Jesus to reign here on earth for a thousand years.  Look, it's been determined.  And it's not based on anything but the foreknowledge of God.  God knows it all.  You know, it's interesting, remember Jesus showing up in the upper room?  He knew that Thomas doubted.  He knew.  Jesus showed up and he told Thomas, you can touch my hands, you can touch my side.  But I'm telling you, blessed is he who believes without seeing.  He knew.  God knows the things that we will say and will think and the things that are going to happen.  He knows.  So He knows what's going to happen.  He is, by His grace, telling us these are the things that are going to happen.  So I want you to be faithful.  And I want you to have hope.  You will not be part of it.  I want you to know what you're not going to be part of.  I want you to know what is going to happen to those that are going to stay here.  And I want you to know that while all of this is going here, you're going to have something else up there in heaven.  And I also want you to know that I'm planning on bringing you back here to reign and rule with Christ for 1000 years.  And when everything is done, when Satan is locked down for a thousand years in the bottomless pit, and you will see that the minute he is released, multitudes will join him again.  Then you know that the great white throne of judgment is judgment that is righteous.  They deserve that judgment.  That's it.  You're my witnesses.  I gave them another chance.  A whole thousand years of physical reign of Jesus with you.  And look what they choose, as always.  So I want to encourage you to, as Colossians 3 says, set your mind on the things which are above and not on the things which are under.  Where Christ is sitting at the right hand of the Father.  During all of this craziness, and it's going to get crazier and crazier.  Look, every time I think, wow, this cannot get crazier than that, I'm proved wrong.  But I want to encourage you that as it gets crazier and crazier, the promise of our departure is actually even more vivid and nearer and near.  And so have a blessed day wherever you are and hold on to the promises of God.  Be blessed and Shalom from Galilee.  God bless you.  Bye-bye. ",
