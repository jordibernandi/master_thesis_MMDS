So this week on Conspiracy Cats, to pay homage to it, I had planned to debunk the very, very worst Flat Earth Top 10 video that I'd ever seen.  However, as I was making that little section, it appeared to me that it was worth a video in its own right.  So here it is.  Ladies and gentlemen, the worst Flat Earth Top 10 that I have ever, ever seen.  Let's get into it.  And I wonder how long it will be.  before he says something wrong. ",

This means, so they say, that when we look towards Mercury, we can't see it because the Sun is too bright.  Now, if you know what you're doing with a telescope, you can actually see it during the day, but if you don't know, try just to remember that less than one year ago, millions and millions of people watched it transit the Sun.  But it's not really the daytime argument that he was concerned with.  It's a nighttime argument.  You see, some flat earthers think at nighttime, we can only look in this direction.  And therefore, at nighttime, we should never be able to see Mercury in the night sky.  However, anybody that stops to think about this more than 10 seconds will realize that just before sunrise or just after sunset are a fantastic time to look at Mercury.  Number nine, next, my favourite of all of them, and I'll tell you why.  Because if you listen to what he says, he states the problem, and then he gives the correct answer himself without needing any help whatsoever.  So I'm left wondering why he even thinks this is a flat-earth proof at all. ",

            "text": "Well done.  And yes, indeed, it is difficult to take a sphere and map it on a 2D surface, which is why we use projections.  And here's how they work, starting with the stereographic projection.  So let's take a toy globe and then mark a point at let's say the North Pole and place it on a piece of paper.  We're then going to draw an imaginary line from the North Pole through the sphere until it hits the paper.  Now the two black dots we're left with represent a point on that globe and the point on the paper where we draw it.  Now if we carried on doing this through every single point in the globe we'd end up with something that looks a little bit like this.  Now you won't see many school kids using these in the classroom but they are favoured for people who work around the poles due to the fact that on a stereographic projection the meridians radiate straight lines from them.  The Mercator map that the Flat Earthers showed us is an example of a cylindrical projection, only in this point we draw our lines from the centre of the globe, and then we unfold the cylinder to show our map.  And of course, even the famous Flat Earth map, the Azimuthal map, is a projection of a sphere onto a 2D surface itself.  Now all these types of projections do some things very, very well, and very, very poorly, unlike this top 10, which just does everything poorly. ",

            "text": "Wow, that's a great point.  Totally incorrect, but 10 out of 10 for confidence.  Now, I do suppose that we famously have the example where a bunch of flat earthers admitted on a Netflix documentary that they got their hands on a ring laser gyroscope and managed to demonstrate this.  15 degree per hour drift.  Yeah, that's right.  The 15 degree per hour drift that we must observe if the Earth is rotating once every 24 hours.  Other than that we've got the Coriolis effect which you might not believe in but the Germans sure did.  Meet the Paris gun, the largest artillery gun in World War One.  In fact its range was so long that when using it the Germans had to account for the rotation of the earth just to hit the target.  And of course we've already talked about the Eotvos effect on this channel named after this guy, Mr Eotvos.  Essentially as a consequence of the earth's rotation something travelling west should weigh more than something travelling east and that's exactly what we see.  Of course, we've got two celestial poles around which the stars appear to move in opposite directions.  And if you study the equator, you see star trails just like this.  Again, direct evidence for a spinning Earth.  And of course, we've got Foucault's pendulum, which appears to drift.  Now, if the Earth was rotating, that drift is due to the rotation of the Earth.  And we should be able to use maths to use that rotation of the Earth to predict exactly what our latitude on the Earth is.  Fully enough, that works.  And here's why it works.  Take the Earth, take a pendulum at the North Pole, and watch the Earth spin.  Now as long as that pendulum has got a specially adapted pivot, as the Earth spins 24 hours beneath it, the pendulum will appear to rotate 360 degrees.  Take another pendulum, stick it at the equator, and because the Earth isn't spinning beneath the pendulum, we won't see any rotation at all.  Then understand as the Earth is a sphere, the amount of rotation will change as you go from the equator to the poles.  And then use a number of different pendulums at a number of different latitudes and a bit of maths to verify that the Earth is a sphere.  And I didn't even bother mentioning satellites.  Next. ",
