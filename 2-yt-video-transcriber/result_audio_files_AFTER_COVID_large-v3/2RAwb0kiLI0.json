            "text": "I've said before how Brexit is going to be something that's going to harm the working class and the poor.  Senior Brexiteers, people who have lots of money, billionaires, millionaires, they're not going to be really affected by this.  They are going to be just fine.  However, it takes a particular type of Brexiteer who will promote Brexit very vocally for years and then decide, actually, I don't want to continue working.  I don't want to continue my business in the UK.  I'm actually going to move it to France.  And this is the case with Sir Jim Ratcliffe.  He was very vocal on Brexit.  He owns a company that modify 4x4 Land Rover discoveries.  and he had his company in Wales but now he has decided to move production to France in the EU.  Ratcliffe built up an estimated 12 billion pound fortune with his petrochemical company and on Tuesday he said that the vehicles that are produced by Enos is going to be built in France instead and he said this is necessary to safeguard jobs at the factory.  Okay.  um now he's been very vocal about brexit even though he left the uk recently to move to tax-free monaco.  once again pure patriotism.  he loves the uk so much that he wants to avoid paying tax there.  I hope at some stage ordinary Brexiteers will understand that these people don't give a crap about the UK.  They don't give a crap about them.  Now Ratcliffe last year announced plans to build a factory in Bridgend and employ 500 British people building a new vehicle.  He said at the time, we have looked long and hard for possible manufacturing locations across the world with lots of good options to choose from.  That was back in September 2019.  The decision to build in the UK is a significant expression of confidence in British manufacturing, which has always been at the heart of what INEOS stands for.  James Dyson, another Brexiteer who recently moved production from the UK to Singapore, is another case of Brexiteers saying one thing and doing another.  These are not people who care about the UK.  They care about their bottom line.  And you can't blame them because they understand that Brexit is a disaster.  But why do they support it in the first place remains to be seen.  In a completely unrelated story, an Australian bank that was operating in the UK has decided to move its offices to Amsterdam because of Brexit.  Once again, where are the Brexit dividends?  Where are the jobs?  Where is the inward investment?  It seems to be going in the opposite direction.  If you listen to Brexiteers online and in the government, they will be telling you, just be patient.  Jobs are on the way.  The Brexit dividend will eventually come.  We just have to be patient.  Those who will not suffer because of Brexit are happy to trumpet Brexit.  So this is just another case of Brexit showing itself up to be an absolute disaster.  But remember, the Jacob Rees-Mogg's, the Boris Johnson's and the Nigel Farage's of this world will be perfectly fine.  They will continue to trumpet Brexit while the working class suffer.  Let me know in the comments section, guys, what you think.  As always, your comments are greatly appreciated.  Thanks a lot. ",
