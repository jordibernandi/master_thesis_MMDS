            "text": "Janez Jan\u0161a has become the new prime minister of Slovenia.  The Slovenian government has more or less flipped from center-left to center-right without even having an election.  The previous prime minister resigned and it looked like there would be an early snap election.  However, the Slovenian Democratic Party, or SDS, was able to cobble together a new coalition.  Janez Jan\u0161a, a former Slovenian prime minister and leader of the STS, was nominated to be the new prime minister.  There was a big question as to whether he could get enough votes.  The Slovenian parliament has 90 members.  He ended up getting a lot more votes than people thought he would.  The vote was 52 to 31 in favor of making him prime minister.  The SDS is a party that is a longtime ally of Viktor Orban's Fidesz and Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia.  I have mentioned them repeatedly as a party that I suspect would leave the EPP and re-affiliate with the ECR if Fidesz also leaves.  The SDS are conservatives, and I have always considered this party to be one of the better members of the EPP.  They are currently the largest party in the Slovenian parliament.  There is another party called New Slovenian Christian Democrats that is also part of the EPP.  You could probably call them a very weak center-right or even just a centrist party.  There is a small party with three seats called the Slovenian National Party.  that is a more hardcore nationalist party.  Now, some people have said that Janez Jan\u0161a has been portraying himself as a centrist for the past few weeks.  Of course, this is kind of natural because he had to recruit a bunch of centrists to form this coalition.  At the very least, this is a victory for Viktor Orban because it means there will be another guy on the EU Council who would veto any action they try to take against Hungary.  Meanwhile, coalition talks are underway in Slovakia.  Most likely, Shmi Rodina, a nationalist populist party, will be the second largest party in the ruling coalition.  They are part of the Identity and Democracy group led by Matteo Salvini's Lega Party.  Meanwhile, on the Greek border, the Turkish police continue to commit violent criminal assaults on Greek border guards and Greek firefighters.  They are using armored vehicles to try to dismantle pieces of the Greek border wall.  The Turkish coast guard has committed very hostile acts and tried to create paths for the illegal aliens.  There are countless videos now that very clearly document Turkey's numerous crimes.  There is also a video showing armed men forcing people off a bus and onto rafts against their will.  An armed man cocks a handgun over the head of a small boy.  One of the perpetrators appears to have both Turkish police insignia as well as a patch for the militant gray wolves.  However, at least seven countries have pledged aid to Greece.  These include Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Estonia, Cyprus, and Austria.  There is new video that shows Austrian police vehicles entering Greece supposedly to provide assistance to the Greek border police.  Of the people apprehended by the Greek authorities, the lion's share are from Afghanistan.  Many more are from Pakistan, Iran, and Somalia.  Actual Syrians are only a small minority of the illegal migrants.  The Turkish Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu bragged on television that the new wave of illegal immigration would crash Europe's economy and bring down governments.  Erdogan himself is increasingly using religious rhetoric and framing the actions of the Turkish government as part of a religious war for Allah.  I will make more videos about Turkey over the next few days.  I will also be making a video about my take on the Coronavirus in the USA.  In the meantime, thanks for watching this video.
