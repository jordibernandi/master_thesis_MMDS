I don't know.  Try to live a life.  Alright.  You got that Leviticus?  Give me St.  John 8 and 32.  Because today you're going to get the truth.  Because everything of heaven and father created and served for purpose.  We were created to be the prince and kings of this earth.  According to the Bible.  You seek for our history.  Our history speaks for itself.

They should be your what?  And they shall be your possession.  What does it mean when you're somebody's possession?  What does that mean?  You're their servant.  Slave is the same thing as an employee or servant.  Same thing.  The Most High said he created you guys to serve the children of Israel.  Right.  Why is that?  Why?  Why?  Jeremiah 12 and 15.  Because one day the whole world will be under the subjection of the Israelites.  If either you're going to do it willingly or you're going to have to die.  And it's according to the Bible.  Give me St.  John 12 and 15.  Because when our forefathers were brought to America, if they didn't get down with the program, what happened?  They had to be killed.  It's the same thing.  But it's going to be a righteousness.  The book of St.  John chapter 12.  Jeremiah 12 and 15.  Jeremiah 12 and 15.  Jeremiah 12 and 15.  How do you feel about this?  It makes me sick.

I got that.  You got that?  The book of Jeremiah chapter 12 and verse 15.  And it shall come to pass that I have plucked them out.  After that I have plucked them out, I will return and have compassion on them.  The Mosiah said, when he took the children of Israel, these people on the side out of the land of Israel, he's going to come back to them.  It's like he's coming back to them for his last days.  Not all of us will sleep like the rest of our brothers.  We've got to wake them up.  Right?  And he's going to return back into us and pour out his spirit on us.  Read.  And will bring them again.  Right?  Every man to his heritage.  In the past days, after you guys go through the hardcore slavery, the Mosais don't let you go, but some of the nations go back to their inheritance.  The original lands he gave them.  Right?  But what's going to happen?  Read.  And every man to his land.  Right?  And it shall come to pass.  Right?  If they will diligently learn the ways of my people.  If you subject them to the Israelites, you understand truly in your soul, the Israelites are your kings.  They are your authority.  we are your masters according to the bible right the chosen people of god.  we're not niggas.  if you acknowledge that i'm not saying you said that.  i'm not saying.  you said that right to swear by my name right the lord.  live it.  right as they taught as they taught my people to swear by baal.  the same way you taught our people to reject them all the time.  if you come back serving these subservience and israelites right read they shall be built in the midst of my people.  you're going to be allowed to miss.  you're going to be allowed to go to the beach but you're not going to go out naked right you're going to have to keep it long.  you're going to have to keep the commandments of god but you're going to have to be under servant under the israelites.  but what's going to happen if you don't want to say read but if they will not obey if you say man i don't know what these niggas are talking about blah blah.  let's go get some margaritas right read.  i will utterly pluck up and destroy that nation.  what did the mozart say?  I will utterly pluck up and destroy that nation.  Right, you did say you're sorry.  You're saying what you say is to be sorry.  Okay, okay, you want to see it.  I want to see, I want to see, because the scriptures say actions are a way to the eyes of God, right?  Your actions.  I could say, yo, I'm your best friend.  I would never do you harm, but I'm stealing money out of your purse.  I'm speaking to you very disrespectfully.  Exactly.  Am I really showing you love?  no actions without any words right?  so i want to see.  if you'll be sorry for me let's see.  so god gave you a way.  there's two things that you could do today right we don't want no millions.  There's two actions that you can do today.  Isaiah 49, 23.  It's the book of Isaiah, chapter 49, verse 23.  Read.  And kings shall be thy nursing fathers.  Right.  And their queens thy nursing mothers.  The most I said the kings should be the nursing fathers and the queens.  Right now, you are the kings and queens of the earth.  Right.  Do you want to take that title or not?  You are the people.  that's ruling upon the face of the earth.  You are.  Right.  Read.  They shall bow down to thee.  What did God say?  They shall bow down to thee.  Are you ready to bow down to this?  The children of God?  You just say you're sorry.  I want to see you actually reflect that.  That's what the Bible says.  It's an answer like that.  Yes.  Yes.  Hold up.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Hold up.  Hold up.  Would you bow?  Hold up.  Hold up.  Hold up.  Hold up.  Hold up.  I got it.  You got it?  You come around.  You can come around, Captain.  Read it again.  And kings shall be thy nurses.  I want my captain of 100 of the children of Israel to be right here for me.  You come around, captain.  Read.  And kings shall be thy nursing fathers.  According to the Bible, you guys are the rulers of this earth right now.  Because of what you did to our forefathers, the most I say, you're going to have to humble yourself down to the children of God.  Read.  And their queens, thy nursing mothers.  Right.  They shall bow down to thee.  Bow down.  Right.  Put their face toward the earth.  Right.  Read.  And lick up the dust of thy feet.  Go ahead.  I'm not going to let you do that because you humble yourself down.  I'm not going to let you do that.  Really?  And thou shalt know that I am the Most High, right?  And you're going to acknowledge that we are the Israelites according to the Bible.  The second thing that you could do right now, right, is admit, are we the children of the Most High God?  Are we the children of the Most High God?  What you're reading, yeah.  I remember you said that you're going to go with what your wife said.  Miss, are we the children of the Most High God?  Do we acknowledge we are the Israelites according to the Bible?  The next thing that you can do, every time you see a so-called Negro, Hispanic or Native American, right?  You tell them they are the children of the Most High God.  They need to repent and keep the commandments of God.  That's right.  And every time you see them, you treat them with respect.  You don't treat them like they're nothing.  All right?  And if you're really sincere... This brother saved your spot, saved your spot in his household, in the kingdom of heaven, if you're sincere.  Alright?  But the most high is in just power.  If you submit yourself to the most high, that will perish.  It won't cause you to perish.  Alright?  But you did what's called for today.  I acknowledge that.  I pray, I pray, it's okay.  I pray, you're amongst the children of God.  I pray that you're sincere.  And that you tell the so-called neighbors in Spanish, they already have their rights.  Alright?  Thank you.  We appreciate that.  Let's go back to the program.  Thank you.  Do you have any, like, paperwork I can look at?  You can get one.  You can get one.  You can get one.  Yeah, you can get one.  We're not going to get yelled at if it's coming to you.  We have brothers who look just like you, but their forefathers were so-called Haitian men.  Their forefathers were so-called Indian, right?  Well, he looks about the same as you, but he's probably an indigenous Indian of the same.  Right?  I'm making an assumption, brother.  That's why people are so emotional.  This is why we gotta come out here and do the work.  Jeremiah chapter 12, verse 9.  Read.  My heritage is unto me as a speckled bird.  The most I say, his heritage is unto him like a speckled bird.  A speckled bird looks all types of ways.  They don't look just one color.  There's things that look brighter than you, but it's not your bloodline.  If you find out later on down the line, your great-great-granddaddy was a so-called black American... You're going to be a sister and you're going to be welcomed in as an Israelite.  If you are.  I have one right there.  And you've got to do your research.  Do your research.  I don't know.  I only can go by what you give us.  We have a friend in Texas.  Right.  Coincidentally, the community is speaking to the same thing.  but before you go do you have any questions for us at all?  that's it.  i sincerely meant what i did.  i pray so i mean i. i mean i know that i was one in front of you but y'all didn't have me.  i pray.  i pray that you know i'm going to be by myself.  i pray you know one day the whole group is going to have to come to this place Isaiah 2 and 1.
