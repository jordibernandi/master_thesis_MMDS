I mean, so if y'all are Umar Johnson followers, trust me, I'm not talking down on you.  I'm not trying to belittle you in any kind of way.  I mean, because for a small amount of time, I was an Umar Johnson fan.  For a very small amount of time, I was an Umar Johnson fan.  But he uploaded this video today trying to explain to the rest of his followers where did all that money go?  And boy, did that turn out to be a good one.  I mean, at the end of the day, a lot of people want to know, like, where the rest of this money Umar Johnson had.  Umar had a million dollars when it came to donations.  He didn't spend all that on that school.  I'm pretty sure.  y'all know that.  I'm pretty sure if you click this button, y'all know how much Umar spent on that school, which means that Scooby had a lot of money left over.  And that's a lot of untouched money that Scooby got left over that people want to know what happened to it.  And up until today, up until the day on this video, he never said where the rest of that money went besides renovations.  And that's all he kind of said in this video.  You run around with this school, my dude, for a whole year and you still ain't got no lights.  You still ain't got none.  You run around talking about you still looking for HVAC people and electricians and carpenters.  But y'all gonna get to see, he had a carpet to pull up on in the day.  Some young dude, no disrespect to the brother.  I don't know if this was a stage plot or what, but he had some young dude pull up on it.  And then this is what killed me with Scooby-Doo.  Where you come up with this idea, yo, that you... That you deserve two wives.  I'm pretty sure a lot of dudes want two wives.  But, Umar, baby, you don't.  I mean, and ladies, this goes out to y'all.  I don't see why y'all feel y'all would allow Umar Johnson to take advantage of both of y'all.  Because that's all he's going to do is take advantage of both of y'all.  But at the end of the day, that's enough of my talking for now.  I'm going to hit you back.  Check this video out. ",

I want to answer a couple of questions about the school, a couple of rumors I've been hearing.  I just want to go ahead.  I mean, my supporters, first of all, my message is only to my supporters.  If you're not an FDMG, Dr.  Umar supporter, then I'm not talking to you.  I want to make that clear.  This is only for supporters, people who have been donating.  It's been six years we've been raising funds.  If you ain't donated in six years, I'm not talking to you, nor are you welcome on this campus because all events will be donor only.  All events will be donor only.  All events will be donor only.  So question number one, what did you do with the money?  That is the silliest question I've ever been asked.  That is the silliest question I've ever been asked.  What did you do with the money?  Well, I think you can see what I did with the money.  We got four buildings.  I think you can see what I did with the money.  We got four buildings.  I think you can see what I did with the money.  So while people ask me what I did with the money, I think you can see what we did with the money.  We bought four buildings.  We bought two schools.  That's what I did with the money.  So I'm not understanding these questions.  What did you do with the money?  What do you think I did with the money?  I bought four buildings, brothers and sisters.  Cash with your money.  We bought for my donors.  This is what we did, but we not done.  It's time for the renovations.  We not done.  It's time for the renovation.  So what did I do with the money?  I bought a school.  That's what I did with the money.  What did you do with any money that was left over?  I'm trying to renovate the school.  We do not have enough money to renovate the big school.  That's the Frederick Douglass building.  That's gonna cost us about a million dollars to renovate.  We do not have the money to renovate this building that you're looking at.  You're looking at the most honorable Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey High School.  We do not have the money to renovate that right now.  But I'm hoping y'all will keep on donating so we can have enough money to renovate that school.  So we're gonna focus on the Marcus Garvey building, the smaller school.  We're going to focus on the Marcus Garvey building, the smaller school, okay?  That's what we're going to focus on, brothers and sisters.  That's what we're going to focus on right now, all right?  So I ain't got nothing to do with what nobody else is doing.  You know, what I see is there's a lot of people who are jealous.  There's a lot of jealousy out there.  You know, I don't know what Jay Morrison is doing.  I don't know.  But what I do know is I don't have sufficient evidence, nor have I heard sufficient evidence from anyone that proves to me that that black man is a fraud and a scam.  Okay.  Whether the evidence exists, I don't know, but I haven't seen anything.  I haven't seen anything.  I've seen a lot of slander, but they do that to me.  I've seen a lot of character assassination, but they do that to me. ",

I'm not into the Tulsa real estate fund.  You understand?  I'm not a part of that.  You understand?  But what I do know is I respect him enough as a black man.  What I do know is I respect him enough as a black man to not slander his name or his movement without sufficient evidence.  I'm not going to do that.  There's been people hitting me up.  What do you think about Jay Morrison?  What I think, I think he's a black man.  Peace and black power.  What I think, he's a black man.  Look like he's trying to do something good.  I can't speak to that.  Y'all talk about the Grandmaster Jay with the impact.  OK, I can't speak to him either.  I can see the value of a brother showing up with a militia, with armed weapons, letting the white power structure of America know we ain't going to take this shit no more.  I can respect that.  Is he serious?  I don't know that.  Does he have a faulty past?  I don't know that.  I don't know that.  People would say I got a faulty past.  I don't understand how I got the faulty past.  I've been saving more black boys than anybody you can name for the past quarter of a century.  But my point is, I'm not slandering Grandmaster Jay.  I'm not slandering Jay Morrison.  Okay, both of them got the name Jay, which is an interesting coincidence.  But I'm not slandering those brothers.  I haven't seen sufficient proof.  To tell me that those brothers are worthy of slander.  I am not going to tear black men down.  Black men have been getting torn down for 400 years.  Black women too.  Black women too.  And I'm not tearing nobody down without sufficient proof. ",

Just because you saw me walk in the store don't mean I stole from the store.  I deal in proof.  Evidence is not enough.  I deal in proof, and to deal in proof is to deal in truth.  Did y'all hear that?  I want y'all to repeat that.  I deal in proof, and to deal in proof is to deal in truth.  If you ain't dealing in proof, you ain't dealing in truth.  Evidence is only suspicion.  Evidence can make you look suspicious.  Evidence is not proof.  Somebody might have saw your girlfriend talking to some dude outside the store laughing.  That's evidence.  Is that proof she was cheating?  Is that proof she was interested in dealing with that brother?  It is not.  It's only evidence.  Evidence can only draw suspicion.  I want proof because only proof can reveal the truth.  Only proof can reveal the truth.  So I'm not going to defame no black man.  I'm not going to defame no black woman without proof.

I cannot speak to a personal.  between men i can't speak to that.  i'm talking about a general community-wide issue.  i haven't seen no proof of that.  okay so i want to be clear.  those brothers who got personal issues with them that's between them.  i can't speak on that.  but in terms of calling somebody a scam and a fraud just because a couple people made some youtube videos i can't do that.  Because most of it, what I see is jealousy.  I know all of my detractors are jealous.  Every last one of them are jealous.  Every last one of them are jealous.  I don't have a single detractor who's not a hater.  I don't have one.  I don't have a... See, everybody talking about me wish they was Dr.  Umar.  They wish they had the six degrees.  They wish they were the doctor.  They wish they was related to Frederick Douglass.  They wish they was the number one Pan-Africanist in the world.  They wish they was the most requested black scholar in the world.  They wish they was the number one black orator in the United States.  They wish that they were about to open up two schools.  They wish that the people gave them three quarters of a million dollars to buy a school.  They wish... That they were six foot three, swagalicious, North Philly beard.  They wish the ladies loved them like they love Dr.  Umar.  They wish they get the birthday gifts that I get from the Queens.  They wish they was me.  They wish they was me.  That's just jealousy, brothers and sisters.  And the reason y'all don't hear me responding to the hate is because I'm so dedicated to the mission.  I'm not responding to the hate.  I don't have to respond to that because this school will be renovated in the next couple months.  God is my witness.  My ancestors right here on this sacred campus.  This school will be renovated in the next couple months. ",
