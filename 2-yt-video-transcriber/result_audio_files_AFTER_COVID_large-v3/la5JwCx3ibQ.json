            "text": "Hello, this is Jesus.  Jesus Christ has come to you just with this quick update.  hi guys this is your sister Karen Giddin in Jesus Christ.  brothers and sisters I want to come to you with a video that I did.  it will play after this.  it's about two and a half minutes long but I did it for you brothers and sisters because I want you to know what's going on.  remember about I think it's about two to three weeks ago.  I came out and and I released a video saying that the radioactive man-made pestilence is airborne.  Now when the Holy Spirit told me that the G5 is radioactive, brothers and sisters, I was taken aback when the Lord spoke to me and told me this, that the G5 is literally radiation that affects the human body.  and you know the story.  uh they're saying it's that flu-like symptoms and this and that it's not.  it's not the flu.  this is basically poisoning literal poisoning.  now Yesterday, because yesterday is the 23rd.  So yesterday, my husband is called Duane.  He basically came to me and he said to me, Karen, have you seen the new \u00a320 money, British money?  And I said, no.  And he said, come here.  I want to show you something.  I'm speechless.  I'm doing this video and I'm literally speechless.  I don't want to talk too much about it because I want you to watch the video that's going to play after this.  Brothers and sisters, all I can say is everything that these wicked government have planned depopulation for the human race, They've put it in movies, they've put it in books, they've put it all over the place.  But they are literally bright and have the audacity, mocking and scoffing and laughing at the people, believing that some of us will not find out that their wicked plan is printed on the new 20 pound British note and the new \u00a320 came out in 2020.  Why couldn't they do it last year?  No, because they knew that they would have released the man-made pestilence, corona, in 2020.  So \u00a320, the new \u00a320 note in 2020, brothers and sisters, shocking.  When you see this video, Brothers and sisters, I'm telling you, some of your family and some of your friends trust too much in their governments.  But I thank God for those of us who are awake and we know exactly what our governments are up to.  They're up to no good.  They're very wicked.  They're literally controlled by fallen angels.  You know, they're not godly at all.  These people are not godly.  And so I did a video.  It's going to play after this, okay?  And I want you to pay attention and listen to what I'm saying in this video.  that's going to play.  It's going to be shocking.  It's going to be shocking.  It's a shocker, brothers and sisters.  They've literally put the man-made pestilence on the new... \u00a320 British note.  And the Queen knew about it.  She came out when?  Three weeks ago, four weeks ago, giving it all that, talking to the British public.  I think this was when wicked Boris Johnson was in hospital.  He was so called sick.  It wasn't really, but anyway, and the queen, she came out giving a talk about whatever she's talking about.  Um, but she knew about this queen.  She knows these people are reptilians.  I'm telling you brothers and sisters, you've got to stop trusting your government and trust in the Lord and listen to what he's saying.  Listen to what he's saying, you know, through his people.  Cause he's speaking.  But I want you to watch, I want you to watch this, this video is going to play now.  As I said, it was my husband, Dwayne, who came and drew this to my attention and I thank God for that.  So I'm able to do this video and then you guys can see it.  So God eternally bless you.  I love you all.  And I will see you soon.  Someday in glory.  In Jesus precious holy name.  Amen and amen.  Amen.  Blessings.  Amen.  Hi guys, this is your sister Karen Giddens in Jesus Christ.  Today is the 23rd of April 2020.  Brothers and sisters, as you can see, I am holding up a UK 20 British pound.  My husband has drawn this to my attention.  He went to the bank.  Well, not the bank, but the cash point and drew some money.  He came back and he said to me, Carrie, I want to show you something.  So brothers and sisters, as you can see, can you see the radiation?  Hold it.  Go the other way.  Yes, yes, yes.  That's it.  Hold it.  Can you see that radiation brothers and sisters?  What we can see here is a 5G tower.  And at the top here, where's my finger?  At the top here, you can see the coronavirus.  This represent the coronavirus.  This represent the 5G tower.  And my husband is moving the money, the 20 pounds, and you can actually see the radiation.  Brothers and sisters, these people are so wicked.  They are evil.  They've literally put out the coronavirus The 5G and the radiation on the brand new British pound.  We are not asleep, brothers and sisters.  Look at that.  My husband is just literally... Oh my God.  My husband is just literally holding the money and just moving it, you know, so that you can see the radiation.  This is what's killing the people.  This is a false fake virus that they say, you know, it's, it's, it's flu like symptoms.  It is not flu like brothers and sisters.  This is what's hurting the world.  This is the 5g that we're talking about.  So I just wanted to come and do this video courtesy of my husband.  I have to give him credit.  Because, you know, if he had not come to me and said, Carrie, look at this.  I want to show you this.  I would not know.  I would not know.  So I just wanted to share with you, beautiful brothers and sisters.  So God eternally bless you.  I love you all.  And I'll see you soon.  Someday in glory.  In Jesus' precious holy name.  Amen and amen.  Amen.  Blessings.  Amen.  Thank you. ",
