            "text": "Welcome to another dumb things people say to atheists.  For our lucky 13th episode, I thought I'd go ahead and dive straight to the bottom of the barrel for one of the most obnoxious, oblivious, and mean-spirited of all the things people say to us.  It grates on my nerves, and I'm sure yours too, like few other things a theist will ever tell us, and it's obviously just pointless.  But I still think it's worth backing up and taking a look at why people say it and how it can hold a quick, easy appeal for your average everyday Christian who might mean well but, being human, get swept up in satisfying and intuitive sounding arguments they don't think enough about.  See, when an apologist doesn't want to dig into complicated topics like, oh, I don't know, whether there's evidence for God or whatever, it can be a lot easier just to bring up people like Stalin or Mao or for some reason Hitler and say something like, you know, atheists have killed more people than anyone else in history.  So yeah, I guess let's break down this amazingly fair, nuanced historical observation.  So why do Christians ever say this?  Well, recognizing as always that reasons vary by person and that we shouldn't try to make assumptions about any specific believer's motivations, I can see a few reasons why this statement might be appealing for some Christians.  To start with, it provides a concrete, deceptively easy answer to complex issues, including why we consider one group of people evil, how they got that way, what really motivates them, and what makes them more or less evil than another group of people.  Properly considered, these questions involve a lot of challenging nuance that defies neat, satisfying answers.  But of course people like neat, satisfying answers, and a statement like, atheists have killed more people than anybody else in history, provides the kind of easy conclusion you'll never get from, you know, properly considering anything.  It does this in two main ways.  First, it provides an easy indicator of evil, murdering people, as well as an easy metric for ranking the most evil people, which is how many people they've murdered.  I mean, if murdering one person is bad, then murdering two people is worse and murdering a million people is way worse.  Of course, this is a simplification, and as I'll explain in a moment it's pretty much nonsense, but it has the advantage of being straightforward.  a person can decisively blurt it out at a dinner party and with a few words make a point that everybody present can immediately get their heads around.  By contrast, any meaningful discussion on the topic would be too lengthy to keep everybody's attention or to be conversationally appropriate for most social settings.  And of course, if it was an atheist who tried delving into such nuance, they think he was just grasping at straws to make excuses for the obvious fact that atheists tend to murder a lot.  Thus we see how the conventions of casual conversation punish well-developed ideas while rewarding any simplification that can be blurted out in the form of a succinct, catchy phrase.  And of course, second, along with an easy measure of evil, this saying gives an easy reason for evil, which is, surprise, surprise, atheism.  Because what's better than proof that atheism is inextricably tied to horrifying evil and can be dismissed as an obvious failure?  You want a world without religion?  Well, just look at the 20th century for a taste of what that would be like.  Totalitarian rulers took over, everybody exalted humans and the state over God, and the next thing you know people were being murdered on a scale humanity had never before thought imaginable.  and blibbity blah blah.  Because of course nothing is truly right or wrong without God, so the moment you kick Jesus out of society, what do you expect, right?  This presents atheism as not only bad, but such a clear and present danger to civilization that we need to take every measure possible, possibly including mild theocratic laws, to keep it from gaining a foothold.  What's more, this is kind of a two-for-one, because along with letting Christians rub shit in our faces over the apparent failure of atheism, it gives them an excuse to minimize the failures of their religion.  Instead of introspecting on things like the Crusades, Inquisitions, Colonial Missions, American Manifest Destiny, or the brutal religious wars that ravaged Europe, while considering the role that fundamentalist belief may have played in making these and many other atrocities possible, they can just immediately brush these events off as numerically insignificant compared to the mass genocides that of course result the moment atheists are put in charge of anything.  This comparison can make Christianity's faults look like an innocent little blip on the historical radar, or perhaps represent it as the only thing that restrained our murderous human nature and kept earlier generations from killing the same kinds of millions that Stalin did.  But of course this is total nonsense that ignores the actual reasons that large 20th century regimes managed to kill so many people.  It's such an obvious, often repeated point that I almost hate to bring it up again.  But the only difference between Stalin and his genocidal Christian counterparts is that Stalin had access to greater populations, technology, and infrastructure.  He wasn't more murderous, he just had more effective tools to work with.  We can vividly illustrate how obvious this is if we imagine that, say, an inquisitor wanted to kill all the heretics.  Being a powerful guy who was pretty good at his job, he rounded up and executed a good solid thousand people.  Now, a Christian might say, this isn't great, but it's an insignificant fraction of the 20 million deaths that are generally attributed to Stalin.  Okay, fine, but what made this inquisitor kill less?  Does anybody think, even for a moment, that there was a point where he paused and thought, you know, killing a thousand people was kind of bad, but I'm not the type to actually kill millions, and that he stopped there because he's bad but not as bad as Stalin?  Of course not.  The Inquisitor was constrained only by the logistical limits that history had placed upon him, and it takes very little imagination to think of what he would have done with modern technology and millions of people at his disposal.  By contrast, Stalin may have slipped into obscurity as just one of many murderous medieval kings had he risen to power several centuries earlier.  The issue becomes even clearer when we shift the analogy from real life Christian murderers to heroes from the Bible.  If we look at an example like Joshua, we'll come face to face with two chilling realities.  One, Joshua repeatedly acted on orders to kill everybody, man, woman, and child, in a city.  no issue of morality or restraint stopped him from killing more than a certain number of people.  He only stopped killing people because, you know, there weren't any people left since, you know, they were already dead because of him.  If there were 20,000 people in a city, he'd kill 20,000.  If there had been 20 million people in a city, he'd have killed 20 million.  And since no issue of morality or restraint ever stopped him from killing, then no issue of morality or restraint separates him from Stalin.  In fact, it could never have occurred to him that Stalin-level murders would have been worse than what he was doing, because at no point did he even consider that what he was doing was bad to begin with.  Which brings us to a second, even more chilling reality, which is that, two, at no point do Christians think that what he was doing was bad.  Unlike the Inquisitor, who can be dismissed as an evil man who but claimed to act in the name of Christianity, the genocidal, kill-people-when-I-tell-you-God-told-me-to-kill-them maniac Joshua is esteemed as a model man of faith.  It's pretty twisted that the same fundamentalists who ask us, what's your atheistic basis for condemning Stalin's murders, literally think full-scale genocides are okay when God commands them.  And once we get past talking about numbers, we come to a second question.  What does atheism have to do with any of this to begin with?  Let's say for the sake of argument that the biggest atrocities were committed by people with no belief in God.  So what?  People with no belief in God is a large category that encompasses all kinds of people.  So are we supposed to account for the actions of every person who doesn't believe in your favorite paranormal proposition?  To put this into perspective, I'm willing to wager that literally all atrocities in history were committed by people who didn't believe in Siren Head.  Do you feel condemned by association with them because you also don't believe in Siren Head?  Would you appreciate a believer in Siren Head expecting you to account for Stalin's actions because he killed lots of people while not believing in Siren Head?  Or tenuously deducing that your lack of belief in Siren Head constitutes a worldview that gives you no basis for condemning mass murder?  If not, great.  And hopefully you're self-aware enough to get my point, and let's see how you come off to an atheist when you try associating us with every other person in history who doesn't believe in your favorite thing.  Really, doing so represents a bizarrely entitled form of conversational behavior, which is drawing a circle around yourself and just defining all the many varied people outside that circle as being not you.  In this case, the people inside the circle are true Christians, and everybody outside the circle is not a true Christian.  Now the people outside the circle might include atheists, Muslims, Buddhists, people who just don't think much about religion, drug addicts, psychopaths, 20th century dictators, and whatever.  Even Catholics might be outside that circle depending on who you talk to, and if a Christian ever does something horribly bad, then... well... No true Christian would ever act that way, so they belong outside the circle too.  And since the most important thing about them all, despite all their differences, is that they're not Christian, everybody outside the circle is essentially defined by the same fundamental shortcoming.  Thus, Christians can define their own in-group in a way that self-selects for believers who behave well and excludes everybody who behaves badly.  Then, in an amazingly audacious twist, blame every single person outside the circle for the undesirable behavior of everybody else outside the circle.  So not only do atheists have to answer for every person who doesn't believe in God, and not only do Christians not have to answer for every other Christian, but in fact atheists have to answer for the behavior of Christians who got defined as being outside the circle because they aren't true Christians.  Basically, Christians just set up the game so that we're going to lose no matter what by sheer definition.  This is how Hitler strangely ends up being included with the atheists for whom we must answer.  Now yes, I doubt Hitler was a devout Christian in the way most people today would understand it.  I think that at least in his public political life, he was a crass opportunist who made use of Christianity one way or the other as it suited him.  Not like any politician we have today, right?  Oops.  So if you're a Christian, I know his record is mixed, and I'm not trying to blame you for him.  But the fact is, he professed Christianity, often spoke highly of it, used Christian slogans and imagery, and so on.  Yet the same Christians who go so far as to say we have to answer for everybody in the broad category of people who don't believe God exists, think they can brush aside someone like Hitler who explicitly espoused the religion just because he doesn't meet their measure of a true Christian?  And more than that, saddle us with him?  Uh, no.  It's absurd.  But those points out of the way, I want to conclude by breaking this down to one core issue, which is that the problem with 20th century dictators isn't that they disbelieved in God.  It's that, once they tore down that belief, to the extent that each of these individual governments actually did, they replaced it with cults of personality and other forms of non-theistic worship that I find just as irrational and destructive as the worship of a god.  See, this gets down to the meat of how atheism can be more fundamentally different from religion than most Christians realize.  It does not, at least by necessity, stop worshipping God just to turn around and start worshipping the state or other humans.  I can see how Christians might think as much, how the concept of worship or deference to an authority figure is so central to their thinking that they think the idea is universal, even inevitable.  But many atheists reject the entire idea of worship.  We realize something's gone wrong when people show automatic reverence to any figure, human or divine, and when obedience to that figure defines what is considered good behavior.  This is dangerous because it subordinates our expectation of basic humane behavior to sheer dictates, thus opening the door to all kinds of abuses.  A well-informed skeptical humanist will see this fundamental flaw at work, regardless of whether the dictate is defined by the state, the dear leader, or someone's idea of God.  So whenever atrocities take place, we dig to the bottom of things and think, where did this go wrong, what lessons can we take from this, and how can we form a society that better preserves people's basic rights and safety?  This is how we critique any society that engages in unjustified harm, whether that society is theistic or atheistic.  The fact that we in one of those societies might share a lack of belief in one specific supernatural proposition is totally beside the point.  In fact, between us and Christians, I'd say we're better equipped to correct what went wrong in these societies because we tend to more explicitly address the core problem, violations of human rights, as well as systematically analyze how things like worship and rule by dictate can lead to those violations.  By contrast, the main thing Christians bring to the table is the assertion that the communists just followed the wrong dictates and worshipped the wrong thing, and based on that, they suggest a different set of dictates based on the worship of a different thing.  Oh, and, uh, by the way, they serve as that thing's messengers and will be able to tell you what it wants you to do, so... This suggestion, of course, does not thoughtfully address the core issues of what an atrocity is, why it takes place, and how we systematically avoid it, and thus it has the exact same pitfalls as the communist worship of state and leader.  This, I'd humbly suggest, is why Christianity has its own history of pointless bloodshed.  Did it shed less blood than atheism?  maybe, I guess, for purely practical historical reasons that have nothing to do with the comparative worldviews, but instead of getting mired in irrelevant arguments over which worship-driven, dictate-based system racked up the highest body count, perhaps we should recognize where worship-driven, dictate-based systems tend to go wrong.  Perhaps we should recognize that when they get things right, they only do so by accident, and that they have an inherent tendency to go wrong.  And perhaps we should stop worshipping anything altogether and just try to construct societies that respect the rights of the people who live in them.  This is a pretty obvious thing to do when you think about it.  Say two people are driving cars blindfolded.  One kills two people and the other kills ten.  What lesson do we learn?  Should our main takeaway be that the person who killed ten people did something worse?  Should we drive the same car wearing the same blindfold as the one who only killed two people?  I'd suggest not.  I'd suggest that we instead start expecting everybody to drive without blindfolds, and that we tell the person who only killed two people that he can't associate us with a person who killed ten just because we don't wear his specific blindfold.  So if a Christian tries telling you any version of atheists have killed more people than anybody else in history, I'd suggest calmly and politely bringing up that 1.  If this is true, it's only because most atheist regimes were better equipped than most Christians in history.  2.  Christians actually justify genocide when it happens in the Bible so they have a fairly tenuous basis for blaming people for other genocides.  3.  Not everybody who disbelieves a proposition is responsible for the actions of everybody else who disbelieves that proposition.  4.  We'll better understand the underlying core problems of communist regimes if we get into the specifics of what they did instead of just identifying them as not part of a religion.  And five, Hitler wasn't an atheist.  One final note, and something I've hinted at, is that at its core, this accusation presents a false dichotomy between explicitly atheist and religious societies.  So my question is, why choose?  In my opinion, a society that enforces atheism is as horrifying as a society that enforces religion.  And as someone with Christian family, I'd have an equally visceral reaction to either option.  The problem with communist governments was not any specific person's lack of belief in God.  It was that the government intruded on people's lives in ways that wasn't its business.  So why not just stop forcing religion or lack of religion on people altogether?  Why not establish a secular society and leave it up to people to practice religion or not as they choose?  It's a pretty obvious choice, and I suspect that people who represent this as a battle between government enforced atheism and theocracy just might be trying to sneak theocracy through the back door.
