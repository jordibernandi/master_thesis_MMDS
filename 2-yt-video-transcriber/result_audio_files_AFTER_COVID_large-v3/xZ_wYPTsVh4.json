            "text": "Good afternoon, folks.  It's Diamond from the Oppenheimer Ranch Project bringing you a quick volcano update.  We have a trifecta of volcanoes exploding today.  Sakurajima, Fuego, and Krakatoa.  Krakatoa volcano in Indonesia with a violent eruption of ash and magma to 47,000 feet.  A large magmatic eruption is taking place at the volcano right now based on satellite imagery.  Vak Darwin spotted high-level ash and SO2.  reaching 47,000 feet, moving north, west, northwest.  A strong thermal hotspot is detected as well.  Both the webcam on Anak, Krakatau Island from the east, showing lava fountains.  We do have video.  If you could bear with us, this is ongoing, and we'll probably have better footage in the morning for you.  But this is what we can get from Indonesia right now, and we'll just show this to you.  It is at night, so the footage, if anyone was in that area, is going to be spectacular.  And this, again, the largest eruption in quite some time, 47,000 feet.  Not only that, we have Sakurajima.  And there you can see some of the pluming.  And it does get a little bit more violent here, so we'll just let this play through.  So it started off here as a lava fountain.  And then there was a much larger explosion right there.  A jet, so to speak, that just shot.  Basically, there it was.  So hopefully we got some pictures of that from far away.  Absolutely amazing explosive activity there being captured at Krakatoa.  Now on the Seismo, nothing showing up in Indonesia.  We also have this footage here from a different source.  Not much better.  Not really much to see on that footage at all.  But we do have some more spectacular footage of... And let's just bring this back here.  This is Fuego exploding just moments ago.  Take a look.  Just amazing.  So Anak Krakatau exploding to 47,000 feet.  And we have Mayon also.  Another explosive activity here.  Boom!  And I hope no one was camping there.  Just fantastic footage.  We'll run that through for you.  And then we have another volcano.  It's not over, kids.  We have an eruption just happening moments ago at Sakurajima with volcanic lightning.  Spectacular day.  And you can see here some of that lightning.  So trifecta on volcanoes.  Just a heads up.  The volcanoes, days be exploding.  We have increased activity at Fuego.  We have increased activity at Socorro de Lima with some lightning.  Just a fantastic eruption there.  And then we have Anacracatau erupting to 47,000 feet.  I'll just run down some of the deets here.  A large magmatic eruption is taking place at the volcano right now based on satellite imagery.  and we will keep you posted.  Anna Krakatau explosively erupting to 47,000 feet, an ongoing eruption.  We have an eruption at Volc\u00e1n de Fuego, and we have an eruption at Sakurajima.  Boom!  Be safe, everybody.  We love you.  Links will be below. ",
