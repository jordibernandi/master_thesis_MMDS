            "text": "My name is Richard, and this is If You Only Knew.  Today's episode is titled, Drip, Drip, Drip, Flood.  Welcome to the digital battlefield.  Now, October's been a steady drip of declass.  We all expected this to be a significant month leading up to the election, where the Patriots planned to declass everything.  We were even told by the Patriots that it would be drip, drip, drip, flood, which we are now watching in real time.  First came the Ratcliffe memo.  Then came the Biden Senate panel review report.  The Clinton email drop, of which we know we can expect a lot more, last week I shared a link to the first 35,000, but in total we know that there's 278,000 on the Wiener laptop and that these are coming before the election, according to Mike Pompeo.  We had the whistleblower come forward regarding Joe Biden's role in the tragic fate of the SEAL Team 6 assigned to target Osama bin Laden.  I'd say this is shaping up to be an explosive month.  But now this week came a story reported by the New York Post, which was a massive bombshell.  And also know that it's not finished, that there's more coming.  And it's going to be a slow, continued drip of information into the election.  This is just the beginning.  And we are going to go through all of these really interesting details in this report.  But we also expect to see more information dropped over the next few weeks from select journalists, such as Janelle Rian, who had the opportunity to review the contents of The Drive.  And we'll release her findings in the Brighton Bibetape series of two videos, which aired this weekend on OAN.  But first, let's back up just a little because the mainstream media didn't really cover the details of what really took place.  As we know, Hunter Biden left a laptop or three for repair.  And when he did not return to pick it up, the owner inspected what was on it in contact with the FBI.  What was left out of the media report was that the FBI threatened him to stay quiet about this.  Things never happen to people who do not talk.  And so the shop owner went to Giuliani in the Senate for protection.  Former Mayor Giuliani discussed the contents with Stephen Crowder here as well.

            "text": "Drive into a repairman's to repair it.  The repairman took it.  Hunter Biden signed a receipt for it, which I have here, and said he would have to.  He was going to come back for it.  Two days later, he came back and gave him a part.  And then when it was done, he never came back.  According to the agreement, after 90 days, the hard drive is abandoned.  under the law, and it belongs to the merchant.  The merchant held it for another three, four months, and then he heard all this talk on television, and he started to get worried.  What do I have here?  This could be criminal evidence.  So he opened it, and he almost fainted.  He said, I never saw anything like this before.  And if you look at the photographs, you'd probably come to that conclusion also.  But then he took a look at the text, and he saw in the text major contradictions to what the Bidens were saying on television, like the one I just told you.  Biden was saying, I didn't know anything about Burisma in Ukraine, and there's plenty of evidence that he did. ",

            "text": "The real finds of the hard drive are the emails, which acknowledge connections with the Ukraine Energy Company, as well as the CCP, Russian oligarchs, and now also business dealings in Kazakhstan.  as well which all were pay-to-play arrangements with hunter acting on behalf of biden senior.  we know that hunter biden's former business partner biva cooney has flipped and turned over his gmail account.  previously was jailed over a bond scheme but he flipped from prison to detail hunter's china influence peddling.  It is obvious that an energy company would not have placed Hunter Biden on their board or any person with a known drug addiction.  In fact, there's apparently 25,000 images on the hard drive in which Hunter is supposedly using some type of substances in almost all the photos, according to Giuliani and Steve Baden, who is also seen in the hard drive.  But this isn't just about what he's doing or the fact that he's using substances.  Inadvertently, Hunter Biden is also exposing himself as a national security risk, as we know that it is more than likely that copies of the hard drive exist within China, making Hunter Biden a threat to the safety of the country.  In another tweet from OAN's Jack Bosabeck, it would appear that the video content has been shared with the CCP, and that it's also been sent to Nancy Pelosi and the DOJ as well.  Two important questions come to mind.  The first important question is, why would Hunter do this?  Of course... He knows that this is important, sensitive material.  So why would he do this?  Is this just drug-induced behavior?  And we come to learn via our favorite anon that this was actually absolutely on purpose and that there may have been a troubled relationship between he and his father, Joe Biden.  It was intentionally left there and not picked up.  Now, in the next post, we see the same people who provided Hunter Biden with.  the underage girls are the same as the ones taking the picture.  as blackmail and bribery, as assurance that a deal will be kept.  As you would expect, Joe Biden has apparently postponed his appearances until Thursday, which I imagine is in light of this hard drive.  This especially makes sense.  He just previously stated that he knew nothing of his son's dealings.  On the very contrary.  And he's going to be called out on that.  The second important question is, how can the FBI defend having possession of these and not say a word?  This is called into question.  how the FBI remained silent on the discovery of the laptop and has added more pressure to the removal of FBI Director Wray, who we know is a block and will be removed at the right time.  But going back to the article, Giuliani did disclose some of the steps taken to authenticate the contents of the hard drive, which took three weeks.  The information... was fact-checked with email recipients, email addresses, and there was even dates and information verified that could only be known by someone with special access privileges to the White House, which is in public, like the dates of certain meetings or who was in attendance.  However, despite the data having been verified by multiple sources, the story is being pushed by the mainstream media to claim it was a foreign intelligence operation.  Here's Adam Schiff.  claiming that the email stories came from the Kremlin.  Otherwise, these stories would have been kept out of the headlines altogether.  This Washington Examiner found that CNN and ABC ignored the story, and other networks showed less than 10 minutes combined.  But are we really surprised?  No.  We were expecting this.  We also know that it's only going to get worse as more intel is released.  Jack Postelbeck wrote, if they were winning, the censorship would be unnecessary.  And he's right.  In fact, they're deeply concerned because Trump is winning in key states already, despite polls showing double digit.  leads for Biden.  However, this Daily Mail article states that Biden's campaign manager says poll numbers are favoring Democrats, are inflated, and warns supporters not to grow complacent because we are not ahead by double digits.  Furthermore, we've all seen the parades, the rallies, the massive crowds one night after the next.  unlike this Biden PA rally with a giant teleprompter and what looks like a very small audience.  Now, of course, the media is reporting that Trump lost the TV ratings war, but many do not watch the mainstream media anymore altogether.  They streamed the town hall interviews where Trump had easily surpassed Biden in online ratings.  However, also factored that Biden's town hall was an hour and a half long.  So viewers could watch the Biden debate afterwards, which was the dumb plan to maximize ratings.  for the appearance of ratings.  While we were on the subject of the debates, there were some also interesting developments.  Scully was suspended from C-SPAN for his conduct on Twitter, which implicates the debate commission of improper conduct.  We also see that the next slated moderator, Kristen Welker, is already linked to the Democratic ties, according to Don Jr.  We also come to learn that the host of Biden's town hall, he was a former Obama speechwriter.  Now I want to go back to the fallout from the release of the Biden information and the massive tidal wave of censorship is created.  To at some point as the great purge of 2020, 95% of the YouTube channels I personally follow are now gone.  Had my following been larger.  I too probably would have also been deleted, but it would seem that I've either slipped through the cracks or flown below the radar.  However, just in case, I have started uploading to BitChute, and there's a link in the description as well as on other social media platforms, Facebook, Twitter, and Parler.  i will continue to report and upload videos until past the election and then who knows i'll do this as long as i can until i'm censored.  however to continue doing this i need your support.  to donate please use the paypal address in the description otherwise you can also purchase from if you only knew cbd.com which offers the highest quality in cbd oils in a variety of forms.  my personal favorite's the coffee.  i found personally that it gives me more focus and energy to start my day with a cup of CBD infused coffee, which is made from the nutrient-dense superfood chaga mushrooms.  Chaga contains a wide variety of vitamins, minerals, and nutrients.  Chaga is also known to slow the aging process, lower cholesterol, Prevent cancer, lower blood pressure, support the immune system, fight inflammation.  Now, if you don't drink coffee, there's all kinds of amazing other products.  Hair care, skin care, treats your pets.  But check out IfYouOnlyKnewCBD.com.  Going back to the story, the New York Post Twitter account was locked and remained so for three days.  This is the fourth largest newspaper in the United States in censorship of a major news media outlet.  Not only that, but Kayleigh McNamee, the press secretary's account, was locked as well.  James Woods, Jack Postenbeck, and even the webpage for the House Judiciary Committee.  No one could share the story.  I was not able to tweet the story either.  Twitter went down for a short time, in which they blamed the outage on a technical glitch later on that day.  This is ultimately proof that the mainstream media is serving as a wing of the Democratic Party and violates laws concerning election tampering.  illegal in-kind contributions to the Biden campaign.  Ultimately, the censorship has backfired massively, and now there's bipartisan support to end Section 230's protection.  Jack Dorsey will appear before the Senate to testify in the manner in which they censor the story, which has become a matter of national election tampering.  Not only has the media become guilty of spreading misinformation for four years regarding Russian collusion and all the other stories that they pushed, now these platforms have been caught in the act of blocking the transmission of real information.  As many have pointed out, this is straight out of George Orwell's Ministry of Truth from the 1984 novel.  And as James Woods accurately described, the perfect synergy of Chinese communism and American sedition.  I also like this meme and felt it was appropriate.  It's not the majority that are silent.  It's the media that are silent about the majority.  I think that's accurate.  In the meantime, we'll keep reporting as developments take place, but we know that more censorship is coming and that each time this happens, the mainstream media is being caught red-handed.  and that eventually all these platforms that remain will eventually end up regulated.  I also want to cover a few more developments from this past week.  Bruce Ohr resigned from the DOJ to avoid being terminated for contact on the IG Horowitz report for serving as the back channel, which linked the phony dossier.  There was also an announcement that John Bash had stepped down upon completion of the unmasking investigation.  Now, many saw this as a means to suggest that the Durham investigation is completed and that no wrongdoing was done and that There's nothing in the findings, but this is not so.  Listen to what John Batchelor had to say about this.  Congressman Nunes, Devin Nunes, reminds all of us that what we're looking at here is a blood trail leading to a closed closet door.  You don't indict the blood trail.  You follow it to find out what's behind that door.  Red October is far from done, and we can expect a lot more D-class to come.  In the meantime, P. Diddy, who was once supportive of the president, as you can see from these photos where you can see them together, has started a political party to endorse Joe Biden, following Kanye West's very compelling video that was released Earlier this week, despite a grueling week of testimony, the GOP has needed votes to confirm Amy Coney Barrett as the new Supreme Court Justice.  And I don't think anyone can say that Barrett didn't handle herself incredibly well despite almost a week of nonstop relentless attacks where she stayed completely calm and collected.  Lastly, I wanted to cover the American frontline doctors who were on the steps of this CODIS on Saturday with more information that I'm sure is going to be censored, but wanted to show you here as well as another group that met in Europe to basically share the same information and ultimately communicate to the public about that there's no reason to continue the lockdown or continue wearing masks.  Now, I wanted to conclude this video by reading a couple of posts.  What if everything you thought was good was really bad?  What if Red Cost took your money to make money trafficking children under the guise of saving them?  Two, what if Disney was part of a vast child pornography and pedophilia network under the guise of providing child-friendly entertainment?  Three, what if Child Protective Services didn't protect children at all but abused them power to separate children from their guardians?  Four, what if church leaders and faith-based organizations oversaw and engaged in sexual abuse of children and fomented a system of protection for themselves instead of being havens of protection and safety?  Five, what if our agencies of government who swore to uphold and protect the Constitution not only taxed and used your money to enrich themselves, but also aided and embedded global drug, weapons, and human trafficking criminal enterprises to make billions, trillions?  Number six, what if hospitals, doctors, and pharmaceutical companies, instead of healing us, purposely prolong our illnesses and in some cases cause them in order to rake billions or trillions?  Seven, what if agriculture and produce providers altered our food to addict us, poison us, make us sick, and stunt our aging as part of some population control scheme?  And eight, what if our past presidents who promised to lead us and protect us were involved in assassinations and attempts of other presidents, led us into endless wars to personally profit with the intent to destroy this great country?  I'm asleep no more.  Thank you, God.  Here's one more post from John Galt quoting our favorite Anon.  You are the support.  People will be lost.  People will be terrified.  People will reject.  People will need to be guided.  Do not be afraid.  We will succeed.  Timing is everything.
