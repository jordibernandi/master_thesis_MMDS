But today I wanted to talk about Canadian Maple Leafs.  I was going through some of my coins today, today and yesterday.  I was going through them and I know I've talked about Canadian Maple Leafs a couple times in recent weeks.  But I haven't sat down with coins in front of me like I'm doing right now.  So I wanted to talk about Canadian maple leaves today.  I wanted to talk about why a lot of people in the comment section have told me that they avoid Canadian maple leaves or why they stack it, but they don't really like it.  And I want to talk about my method of maple leaf stacking.  So here in front of me, I have a couple different things.  I have what used to be my pocket silver, hence why it's so scratched up.  Canadian maple leaf.  This is a 2009 silver maple.  Used to carry this around with me.  Go to work, go to class, go to the gym, go to the store.  That was usually in my pocket.  We also have just a little stack of six uncirculated maple leaves.  These are all 2018s, by the way.  Just kept this separate.  Got that over a year ago, I believe.  And then we have two mint tubes.  Neither one is entirely filled up.  Obviously this one's a lot more filled up than this one is.  This one has 24.  You have 24 and this one has six.  The difference between this tube and this tube is This one over here on the left, these are all culls.  These are all damaged, scratched up, scuffed, discolored, toned, milk spotted Canadian maple leaves.  You can actually see in the tube how it looks like there's some gaps.  That's just how dark or how toned the grayish brownish color some of the maple leafs are and these are uncirculated.  now i do have more tubes than just these.  i have filled up tubes in the past of both silver eagles and canadian maple leafs.  but i do something a little bit different.  i separate them because when i first got started stacking i was only picking up a handful at a time.  two three four five six ounces of silver at a time and usually they'd be kind of mixed up.  If I picked up, let's just say six ounces of silver, it was probably or likely to be three silver eagles and three silver maples.  So I was always kind of sporadic with what I would get and I would never get a whole lot at a time.  It's not like at the very beginning.  I was picking up an entire tube at a time.  I was just only picking up a little bit.  So I would get the tubes separately and then I would label them.  That way I don't have to pry open the top to see what's inside not that you really have to do that anyway.  like i said you can tell some of them are actually darker than they're supposed to be just because of discoloration.  so that's how i separate my maple leaves and i do the same thing for silver eagles by the way even though i don't typically pick up cull eagles.  i'll pick up cull maples but we'll get into that in a little bit.  so we have a couple different maple leaves in front of me.  I also have the 25th anniversary, which I'm just now remembering that I forgot to bring out, as well as the 30th anniversary silver maple.  I should have brought them out, but I'm just going to talk about regular Canadian maple leaves today.  Maybe I'll make a separate video on those.  Today I wanted to talk about why a lot of people choose not to stack silver maples.  Now I'm not necessarily speaking for anyone, I'm just talking about the comments that I have received on my videos.  I've gotten so many comments from so many people saying that they completely and entirely avoid maple leaves at all costs.  One of the main reasons is due to milk spotting.  As of 2018, that has Apparently been resolved.  I guess we're gonna have to wait another couple of years to see if anything 2018 and newer begin to milk spot.  we can say aha The process is still flawed But that's one of the main reasons.  I've read at least in the comment section that people will try to avoid Canadian maple leafs.  They don't want to pick something up that milk spots.  I on the other hand Do not mind milk spots.  But one of the other reasons is they don't want to stack coins with the Queen's face on it.  I never have and never will understand that mentality.  I don't get it.  I've asked why it matters and a couple people have given me a couple different reasons.  Some people have told me, I don't want to support the Queen.  If you ask me if you're stacking silver, whether it has the queen's face on it or not, you're supporting yourself, not the queen.  You're supporting yourself, your family, your future, not anyone or anything else.  But that's just my opinion from my perspective.  I'm not a financial advisor.  Nothing on this channel is financial advice.  It's all for entertainment purposes only and to initiate a conversation.  Which reminds me, if anybody wants to head on down to the comments and share some of your thoughts on Maple Leafs, I'd like to know.  But moving forward, those are the two main reasons.  I've read that people try to avoid Maple Leafs.  I think it's a beautiful coin.  Now obviously, I'm not the biggest fan of this side.  I don't think this is very great to look at.  But as I've been saying for over two years at this point, I don't care if the coin around the bar has Rosie O'Donnell's face on it.  I'm still going to stack it because silver is silver at the end of the day.  But if you flip it over, I've always been just such a huge fan of nature and art.  And this right here, it's just a work of art.  I think it's a beautiful coin.  I love the way it looks.  I love the leaf.  And I really like anything that has to do with nature, trees, leaves, animals, stuff like that.  So I think it's a beautiful coin.  And... I'm going to continue stacking it.  Here's the thing.  In 2018, the Royal Canadian Mint evidently enhanced their minting procedures and apparently this is going to prevent milk spots moving forward.  2018, 19, 20, 21, 22, everything in the future is apparently not going to receive Milk spots.  now for those of you who do not know what milk spots are Let me see if I have any here towards the top of the milk spotted.  Let's see.  Let me take the first couple of ones out.  Okay, so We all know what an uncirculated Maple leaf should look like.  nice and shiny.  Nothing wrong with it.  This one right here.  Yeah, I Nice and shiny, nothing wrong with it from afar, but if you get closer, right over the 4-9's fine.  Over on the right side, you can actually see some spots.  You can see it underneath the CA, the beginning of Canada.  You can see even a few other spots as well.  Nothing problematic.  Nothing that eats away at the silver content.  But I understand it's not the nicest thing to look at.  You can see some more over here.  Just some specks over here at the top.  On the queen's face over in front of her face over on the right side.  That's what milk spots are.  Just little specks.  Little spots.  Some more than others.  I have some in here that... are heavily milk spotted.  Let's see if I can find them at the top.  I'm not going to go through all of them, but let's see.  Okay, so here's the prime example.  This is a heavily milk spotted Canadian maple leaf.  That whole upper right end of the coin and also the entire left end of the coin as well Milk spot.  And I've said in previous videos that I don't know for sure what causes milk spots.  I don't think anyone really does, but I've been saying it for a while now.  They resemble fingerprints.  Tell me.  Tell me that doesn't look like a fingerprint over here.  You can actually see the lines as if it's an actual fingerprint.  So, this kind of leads me to believe that maybe, possibly, potentially, milk spots could be caused by the oils on our hands.  It looks like he picked it up like this, and it left a muck spot, and if you flip it over, spot in the same area as if you pinched it to pick it up.  I don't know.  I'm sure it's a variety of factors.  I'm sure it's the chemicals or the moisture in the air, the oils on our hands.  It also very obviously has to do with the minting process and procedures as well.  But it's just a theory of mine.  And in my opinion, it makes sense.  But A lot of people have a lot of negative things to say about milk spots.  They don't wanna pick up coins that have white spots or fingerprint markings or things that resemble fingerprints at least.  A lot of people don't want coins that look like this.  I do.  You wanna know why?  Because the premiums are lower.  And due to the fact that I do not live in Canada, Therefore, the maple leaf is not the coin of my country.  I'll continue to stack it.  because of its ability to be recognized, its recognition, its higher level of notoriety, it's the second most popular and trusted pure silver coin on the planet as far as I'm concerned.  But it's not the coin of my country.  I believe that the foundation of anyone's stack should be the coin of their country.  If you live in Canada, the Maple Leaf would be that coin.  But I just so happen to be blessed and fortunate enough to live in the United States of America.  Therefore, the Silver Eagle is the pure silver coin of my country.  So that's the foundation of my stack.  But second in command always has been the Canadian Maple Leaf.  And I love the coin.  I do not mind the milk spots.  Anytime I'm picking up cull maples, they typically arrive with milk spots.  You know what?  Let me see if I can dig out that slightly darker maple leaf.  Let's see if it's a noticeable difference or if it's just the outside of the coin.  Let's see.  Nope, it's just the outside of the coin.  But this is what I'm talking about.  Obviously, some are darker than others.  Toning, discoloration, that's just what happens sometimes.  I'll stack them regardless of if they're toned, regardless of if they're discolored, regardless of if they're milk spotted, because in my opinion, actually it's not just my opinion, it's a fact, silver is silver, no matter what.  If it's milk spotted, if it's tarnished, if it's toned, if it's scratched up, silver is and always still will be silver.  unless something is eating through the silver content, which, by the way, milk spots do not do, it's still silver, so I'm still going to stack it.  So what I like to do, the way I like to stack my Canadian maple leaf, sure, I do have some uncirculated ones.  I have a stack of six right here.  I have a couple in this tube right here.  I have other tubes in my safe.  Even though I have uncirculated eagles, what I've been doing for the last, I don't know, probably year, year and a half, is I'll pick up a couple Canadian maple leaves.  Primarily, I stack the silver eagle, as I've said, in many other videos and also earlier in this video.  I primarily stack the Silver Eagle and I do pick up quite a few at a time.  But whenever I do, I always make sure to pick up at least a couple Canadian Maple Leafs as well.  And over the last year, I would say, I haven't picked up any uncirculated Maple Leafs.  If I'm picking up a Maple Leaf nowadays, it's gonna be a Co.  That's just what I do.  I don't pick up a lot of them, usually no more than three, four, maybe five at a time.  I'll just include a couple in my order.  And typically, they arrive in condition like this, either scratched up or the condition that I just showed you before with the milk spots.  They're cold.  The premiums are lower.  It's still the same exact identical amount of silver.  It's still a troy ounce.  A four nines fine pure silver.  it's still the second most recognizable silver coin that there is which is why it's second in command when it comes to my stack.  but everything that i said in this video it's all just for entertainment purposes.  it's obviously not advice but it is to initiate a conversation.  so i'm curious what are your thoughts when it comes to the silver maple leaf if you stack it?  if you do not do you have any reasons behind it?  maybe you live in canada.  therefore it is the coin of your country.  So that's what you stack primarily.  Maybe you live here in the States or a completely different country and you choose to stack it anyway because of its level of notoriety, because it is recognizable, because it is trusted.  Maybe there's a different reason.  Maybe you avoid it altogether as well.  Maybe you avoid coins that are prone to milk spotting.  Maybe you avoid coins with the Queen's face on it for whatever reason.  Or maybe there's a completely separate reason of your own.  head on down to the comments and let me know your thoughts anything and everything related to canadian silver maple leafs.  if you guys enjoyed today's video please hit that like button.  if you guys like me make sure to subscribe new videos every single day 365 days a year.  also subscribe to my second channel which is my backup channel for exclusive weekly content.  brand new video over there.  go check it out.  the link will be in the description trying really hard to hit 1 000 subscribers.  so help us out.  and if you want to help support the channel in the biggest possible way please consider getting yourself some dydss merchandise.  of course we have some precious metal themed t-shirts and hoodies which are up for grabs along with the three brand new Three nines fine, four nines fine, and 90% t-shirts and hoodies available in black, white, gray, red, blue, and pink.
