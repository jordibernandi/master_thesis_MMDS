Set somebody up with some driving charges.  Maybe some reckless driving and some DUI.  You are C Thayer.  Get a good pick.  That way we can exploit the criminals.  He's flying a drone.  That's what he's doing.  He's flying a drone.  Someone's backpack.  Fully loaded backpack.  He fails to see the evidence right there.  That's a crucial piece of evidence right there.  He's busy flying the drone.  That's one hell of a drone you got there.  Taxpayer's money, huh?  So I'm going to help you out, buddy.  There's a backpack over there with evidence in it.  You should go grab it.  Stop playing with toys and do your job.  Grab the evidence, buddy.  It's over there.  You're fully equipped with the people's money, huh?  Probably got a $5,000 drone, if not more.  Never seen it come in a case like that.  People's money.  Wasting the people's money.  Good view.  That's right.  If you want privacy, you have to create it.  You are doing the right thing, buddy.  That is right.  You are in a public easement.  There is no privacy in public.  If you want privacy, you have to create it, buddy.  Yep, we got it.  I heard it.  You don't know where you're going with the drone?  That's terrible, buddy.  That is terrible.  You don't look like much of a cop.  You don't look like much of a cop, buddy.  How do you fare without your gear?  Without all your equipment, without your guns, your taser, your pepper spray, your CO spray, how do you fare without your knife in your pocket?  You probably don't do too well without all that equipment, right?  I just found out the other day that Linwood PD is one of the scummiest piece of shit police departments in Washington.  You guys are one of the most shittiest police departments in Washington.  You are garbage.  You are absolutely fucking garbage, dude.  You're working for the worst precinct in Washington.  That's the Seattle PD.  You guys are garbage.  yeah your buddy.  uh jordan korea.  yeah he set me up with some charges recently.  he's about to be fired.  he's working with his daddy al korea.  yeah oh yeah i know all about you guys.  i've been studying you guys very well very well.  i'll do my uh studying on you.  i'll do all my research on you tonight.  You are my next research study.  You guys want to set people up.  That's what you're good at, setting people up, charging people.  Letting the drone sit in a standing position in the air.  That's quite the drone you got there.  You guys think you need a drone?  You're not capable of finding the suspect yourself?  Oh, and he's got a 1500 watt amp in his car, wow.  What's he need a 1500 watt amp for?  He's got locked cabinets.  They're taking anybody they can.  Become a cop these days.  Nobody wants to become a cop anymore.  Nobody wants to be a cop anymore.  Age of the dinosaurs.  You got in too late, buddy.  Age of the dinosaurs.  Cops are garbage now.  You got a $30 haircut, now you think you're like Rambo.  $30 haircut, now you're Rambo.  You think you're gonna take out people.  You got a lot to learn, dude.  If you set people up, you're going to go to jail.  You're going to go to prison.  Remember that.  Don't ever make up charges.  Don't ever make up false charges.  Don't ever pull someone over for something they didn't do.  Don't ever give them a criminal record.  Try to create a criminal record because you will go to prison, believe it or not.  Don't ever set somebody up.  If you want to be a good cop, be a good cop.  Don't set people up.  Got it?  Setting people up is not going to help you at all.  What's that?  Say again?  What law is that?  Cite a law.  Cite a law.  Cite a law.  Give me 25 feet.  Give me 25 feet.  Give me 25 feet.

You don't know the law.  Glenn, move back or you're going to get arrested.  The law is five feet.  Five feet.  No, sir.  You need to move back, Glenn.  I'm going to give you a last chance.  I'm ordering you to loftily move back so he can land his drone safely.  He can land his drone.  I'm on his way.  He's landing it right there.  Get out of my face.  Get out of my face.  Get out of my face.  Glenn, I'm going to count to 20.  Count to 20.  And you're going to get arrested for obstruction.  Thank you.  Al, you're going to go to prison with your son.  You're both going to go to fucking prison where you belong.  You're going to go to prison, Al.  You're going to go to prison.  That's where you belong.  Jordan's going to prison.  Your son's a piece of fucking garbage.  Without his gun, without his belt, he's a piece of garbage.  Your son is garbage, Al.  Your son is a little fucking faggot.  Your son is garbage, Al.  I'm on a public fucking easement.  You don't tell me where to go, you fucking idiot.  Shut your mouth.  Stay there and shut your mouth, Al.  Shut your mouth, Al.  You're an old man.  Retire.  Retire.  We don't need dirty cops.  Bitch.  We don't need dirty cops.  Yeah, make a phone call, you fucking idiot.  Make a phone call.  There's nothing you can do.  I'm on a public fucking easement.  There's nothing you can do, you stupid fuck.  You give Italians a bad name.  You and your dirty fucking son give us a bad name.  You are garbage.  You are fucking garbage.  Don't ever try to set me up with charges again.  Don't ever have your son follow me in a car again.  Your son preys upon me again, he'll be arrested.  Yeah, get the fuck out of here.  Don't ever fucking prey upon victims again, the public.  Don't ever do it again.  Good.  It's your right to record.  You're supposed to record.  Don't ever have your son attack me, prey upon me again, Al.  Don't ever do it.  Teach your son to be a fucking good cop.  Don't give me lawful orders to get off a public easement.  You get the fuck out of here.  You're going to count to 20.  You're not big enough to take me out.  You're not.  Do what you're going to do, old man.  Do what you're going to do.  You haven't done nothing.  You're standing there.  You're wasting time.  You're a piece of garbage.  No, I'm not.  I'm way far away from you.  I'm well within the feet.  You're engaging me.  I can't concentrate.  You're not doing nothing.  You're not doing nothing.  He's putting it away.  You're standing there watching him.  You're useless.  Your salary is useless.  Get the fuck out of here.  Shut up.  Get off the radio.  Yeah, get the fuck out of here, piece of garbage.  Fuck your son.  Fuck Jordan.  They fail to see the backpack.  What's that?  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm destroying these cops.  This guy's a piece of garbage.  Watch out for him.  His name is Al Korea.  His son is Jordan Korea.  They are garbage.  They will set you up.  These are some bad fucking cops.  Huh?  What am I doing?  They're flying a drone and they're like... There's like a backpack over there.  They don't even see the backpack.  They're so stupid.  Yeah, they're so dumb.  They're so stupid, dude.  He tried to threaten me with arrest, but you can't arrest me.  I'm on the public easement.  Yeah, they try to scare you.  They think you're afraid of them.  So he's like, we're landing the drone, and if you don't move, I'm going to give you 20 seconds to move.  So because he flew the drone purposely over to me, I moved.  But if it wasn't near me, I wouldn't have moved.  What's that?  That's what I was wondering, too.  I haven't seen him.  I haven't seen him at all, but... Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Don't worry.  I ain't got it.  But I'm guessing like they had a drone.  So when Everett called them, you know, But are you guys from Linwood?  You guys know Linwood PD?  Have you had problems with them in the past?  You said Korea.  You said Officer Korea.  Jordan Korea.  Al Korea.  I've heard that name before.  Officer Korea.  Yeah, they're garbage, dude.  His son just became a cop.  Really?  Yeah.  He's following his dad's footsteps.  Officer Korea.  He's been a cop for a long time.  yeah his father yeah yeah they.  they try to act like they help the public but they don't they're.  they're here to ticket you.  they want to give you a record.  they want to build you a record.  they're not here to help you.  Yeah, they're here to like... Yeah.  Yeah, they shut down all the courts for six weeks.  And they pushed out court dates to like... Yeah, you can't get out of jail.  If you go to jail, you're fucked right now.  But yeah, have a good one.  Be safe.  Yep.  Al Correa.  He thinks he's a bad little Italian guy.  He's a fool. ",
