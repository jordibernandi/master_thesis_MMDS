            "text": "Hey there, it's ya girl, Z, and today I'm excited to talk about the single most important element of vocal feminization.  Now before we talk about it though, you need to know that every container around you produces a natural frequency.  The fancy word for this is eigenfrequency, and we can hear this with almost everything around you.  That's a cool one, right?  Just like all of these objects, your throat has its own pitch.  Let's take a listen.  Your vocal tract is like a pipe, like this, right?  What I'm doing is I'm tapping that pipe, and depending on the size of that pipe, it produces a range of different frequencies.  By gaining control of this throat tone, we gain control over R1, and that functions like our gender knob.  So that throat pitch, or that R1, it exists as a separate and independent pitch from the one that your vocal folds produce.  So if I sing this note, there's that pitch, and then there's also this pitch, or or those two pitches, the distance between them is the primary factor responsible for determining vocal sex.  So for instance, if I make this one here, those are like close to the same.  If I make this higher, Ah, heat from fire.  But I speak and sing at the same pitch that I originally sang at.  You hear how different that sounds, right?  This neck tone, so to speak, is actually your first vocal tract resonance, okay?  So we call that R1 to simplify it.  Basically, when you talk or sing, that neck tone or the R1, it's no longer audible like a clear pitch.  When you hear it like this, you can hear what it's doing, right?  But you don't get to hear that when you practice voice very well.  Instead, wherever that pitch is, it turns into a loud spot and everything near it gains volume.  That's where the loud spot of my voice is.  And so it sounds really bright, right?  If I put it lower. ",

            "text": "So we have to think of our resonances as modifiers.  Let's see how this modifies it.  If I change this.  This takes on the same quality, okay?  Your vocal folds make sound down here, right?  And then that sound has to travel through the pipe and depending on the natural frequencies or resonant frequencies of the voice, it gets modified just like that.  It's no different than what you just saw there.  In fact, we can even do this with a model of the vocal folds.  So look, if I take this sound here, this is basically what vocal folds do.  And if I attach that to a dark R1, if I take this neck tone low, it sounds very male.  And if I do the same thing but high, it sounds way more feminine.  But why is R1 so important in the first place?  When somebody is exposed to testosterone, the vocal tract expands, which causes that natural frequency to shift lower.  So imagine if I had never been exposed to testosterone.  If I tapped this, it would be like this.  And as testosterone expanded my vocal tract, it caused it to do this. ",

            "text": "By learning how to control the shape and size of the vocal tract, we can control that R1, thereby giving us the ability to reverse the primary effect hormones have on the vocal tract.  While there are other resonances and other elements responsible for voice feminization, this is by far the most significant and important difference.  You can get the biggest results from modifying R1 relative to everything else.  And R1 can be controlled by lots of things.  Oropharyngeal closure, larynx height, jaw behaviors, tongue positioning, epilaryngeal modifications.  Technically, when you open and close your nose, it kind of fluctuates as well.  So, but the key is not to get lost in all these little pieces and little components.  We instead focus on the sound.  We do this by hearing, by mimicking and refining our mimicry.  By mimicking the exercises I'm about to do, you will be copying the muscular behaviors that I'm doing, okay?  And then that will allow you to think, what does this feel like?  What does this sound like?  How is this different from what I was doing?  And that is how you learn to control R1.  Here are four basic approaches that you can do to explore R1.  I'm actually about to put out an exciting community document on tons and tons and tons of different approaches, but here are four simple ones that I find to be very effective in my practice.  Exercise number one.  Okay, so I want you to mimic me.  First, we're going to do a voiceless exercise.  This means that we don't use pitch.  Instead, we use the sound H. and we connect it with different resonance, okay?  So let's do this.  Mimic me.  You hear that?  It's just like eh, right?  It's neutral.  Now what you're gonna try and do is you're gonna try and shift it to the same sound, but it's gonna be a lot brighter and glassier.  It'll sound like this.  Try that.  And really listen to it.  I'll do it several times for you.  When you mimic me do that, you're mimicking all those like weird little technical motions.  You're mimicking my tongue behavior.  You're mimicking my oropharyngeal behavior.  You're mimicking my larynx behaviors.  You're mimicking all of these things.  And if you can achieve this sound, you have the correct resonance.  Now, whenever you feel like you have the right sound, try to convert it into pitch either by going quickly to the sound or by going slowly, whichever you think is more useful for you.  So we could try like this.  Heat from fire, fire from heat, right?  Or we could try and just jump straight to it.  Eh, eh, eh, part.  Okay, cool.  Now I'm using that resonance.  And here's what we're really doing.  See, that's just raising the R1.  That's the whole goal of this, okay?  Exercise number two.  I really love this one.  We're gonna make this sound.  Good.  And then we're simply gonna try and modify it like this.  And when you think you have it, just try and say a word.  Part.  Ooh, okay, not bad.  We'll try again.  Puh, puh, puh, puh, puh, puh, puh, puh, puh, puh, puh, puh, puh, puh, puh.  Part.  Party.  Peek.  Puh, puh, puh, puh, puh, puh, puh, puh, puh, puh.  Pack.  Pack.  Exercise number three.  Now this one, we're actually going to use pitch.  We're gonna try and do it with our lips closed though, making the sound M, like so. ",

            "text": "That's a low R1.  Mm.  And what we're gonna do is we're gonna try and shrink that, like so.  Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.  Hear it?  That's the R1 going up.  It sounds buzzy.  It sounds kind of wine-like or bright.  Here's the sound again.  Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, ma, heat from fire.  See, it's all the same thing.  It doesn't matter if you do it voiceless, if you do it voiced, if you do it through an M, if you do it with an external device, if you do it when tapping your neck, it's all about how big the space is back there and how that plays with the sounds that you create.  Now make sure that you're not just moving pitch, like so, mm, mm.  That's the sound of the resonance not moving at all while the pitch climbs towards it and the ratio gets narrower.  Exercise number four.  These are called vowel gradients.  These are pitched exercises.  And what you're going to try and do is you're going to try and incrementally make this brighter.  So mimic me.  I'm starting dark.  And then I'm going to go... and then I'm going to go bright. ",

            "text": "All of those were examples of the R1 going up, okay?  And if I do that with tapping my neck, it's all that, okay?  Okay, okay, I get it, but how do I use these exercises?  If you properly mimic these exercises, your vocal tract will be shrinking.  These should be treated as tools to teach you the general movement and feeling associated with altering R1.  Doing these over and over and over and over without understanding why, that's not gonna help you, okay?  Do these four to 12 times, and if you don't feel like you're making any progress, put them down and come back two hours later, or three hours later, or a week later.  This is not something that you like grind at, this control.  It's about precisely moving around and gaining new awareness of what you can control, okay?  These exercises are demonstrations of what it sounds like when we shrink the vocal tract, thus raise R1 to female levels and beyond female averages.  The fundamental challenge of voice feminization is learning how to create... stabilize and maintain a higher R1 during speech without any harsh effects happening like you're squeaking or scratching or you feel tense or your voice sounds awkward.  All right, so some key things that we wanna make sure that you don't do though, don't strain, don't over tense, don't protrude your jaw, don't flip into falsetto.  These are all common things that happen.  This shouldn't be tense, okay?  If you're doing it right, it's not going to be tense.  It is not tense for me.  So if you're feeling tension, that is a key indicator that means you're not reaching for the right muscles back there.  So in summary, thank you so much for watching.  I hope this is helpful.  Resonance is not a place.  It's not a feeling.  It's not magic.  It is simply how cavities and chambers and rooms interact with the sounds inside of them and cause them to change.  Thank you all so much for watching.  If you have any questions, please post below.  Check me out on Patreon, Instagram, all those other things.  And if you are interested in private lessons, please email me at transvoicelessons at gmail.com.  However, do note that I am overwhelmed with students at the moment and I will do my best to process your request.  Thanks so much and have a great rest of your day.  Bye. ",
