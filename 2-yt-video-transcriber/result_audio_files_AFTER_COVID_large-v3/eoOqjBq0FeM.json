            "text": "Those are the words, of course, from the famous movie Fight Club, which, I don't know about you, seem more truer than ever, as, of course, the system... Doesn't really seem to be doing too well.  welcome back ... beautiful and amazing human beings.  this is Luke Rudowsky of ... wearechange.org and in this video we will be discussing the latest ... social engineering that is happening because of the ... mainstream media right now as well as a very interesting ... perspective from the Russian President Vladimir Putin that ... has some very interesting insights to what is happening ... now domestically in the United States and before we get into ... that plus a lot more.  this video wouldn't be possible if it ... since of course we are a hundred percent demonetized ... now as well as censored and shadow banned on.  of course this ... very platform and because of that as well as us speaking ... truth to power.  your support is more important than ever for ... the few of you that still can help and do.  sincerely thank you ... from the bottom of my heart.  I wouldn't be here without you ... and you're more important than ever.  Now I don't know about you but if someone told you just ... even a few weeks ago that scenes like this where tens of ... thousands of people are gathering in public would be ... promoted by the health stream media and government ... you look at that person and say what the hell is wrong ... with you.  there's no way that something like this could ... happen especially in the epicenter of a global ... sickness with the highest recorded mortality rate.  There's no way that this could happen but it has even with ... the backing of the quote medical professionals and ... experts that by the way are not saying that you won't get ... sick are not saying that you won't die.  they're saying that ... it would be worthwhile to get sick and to die to support ... political ideology that of course all the multinational ... corporations are promoting at the same time.  this is lunacy ... as of course major media organizations are promoting ... these protests.  some of them even like CNN are telling them ... and instructing them that they shouldn't be peaceful ... meanwhile just a few minutes later they're going to be ... lecturing us how about how bad is going to be if other ... people of other political ideologies meet the same ... in the same way.  so let me get this right.  so um if you're ... protesting or even if you're looting or rioting the you ... know the mainstream media will say great job prop you up ... you're a patriot and you're immune from this global ... sickness.  don't worry about it.  you attend a Trump rally ... well you're racist and you're going to kill grandma.  listen I ... don't believe in playing the left-right paradigm but ... again we have to understand here.  this is something that we ... still don't know the full ramifications of other ... countries like Australia on the other hand are taking ... extreme measures and have now just recently extended their ... travel ban for another three months.  yes people in ... Australia are banned from leaving the country for ... three months all the way till September.  Meanwhile here in the United States.  this is a ... sickness that reportedly predominantly is going after ... black Americans the same people that of course the ... establishment is pushing out there to protest right now.  which according to their own logic and thinking will have ... severe health ramifications on black people.  all the while ... other quote health experts that were told to believe ... without even questioning them.  people like Melinda Gates are ... coming out and saying that black people should get the ... priority for a quote new vaccine.  by the way it takes ... many years to guarantee the safety of a vaccine but the ... first initial trials that could be very dangerous.  well ... those should definitely go to black people first then ... healthcare workers.  yes those are the statements behind ... Melinda Gates who along with Bill Gates went when ... questioned about the severity and the huge size and scope of ... these demonstrations on the street where thousands of ... people are chanting and screaming together when asked ... about this clear potential danger according to their own ... official story that they've been pushing on us.  well Bill ... All for that the same man that was a major proponent of ... closing down businesses shutting down the entire ... economy creating massive pain and suffering which damages of ... the socio-economic effects we will be feeling for the next ... few years all to stop a virus that now he doesn't even care ... this protest and movement which local governments are making steps to make sure that we won't even be able to understand if a new spike if a new second wave did or did not come from these protests.  since of course these contact tracers in places like New ... York City are told specifically to find out ... everything about you where you have been who have you ... been in close contact with?  where have you worked?  what ... elevator you shared where you sat your fat buttocks at.  But New York City contact tracers have been instructed ... have been told not to ask people if they attended ... protests which of course will make us not understand how ... these big protests are actually affecting the spread of the ... sickness since of course their political agenda promoting ... than the human lives that it has potential to devastate.  All the while New Yorkers are still being punished.  Parks are still off limits and even barricaded in more as New ... York City is going around today and welding gates shut ... on parks because God forbid people don't socially distance.  As of course they cheer on and celebrate these protests all ... the while making life here more impossible to live ... especially if you're a business owner which most of ... which you can't even still operate as of today and even ... the doofus governor is threatening more lockdowns.  something of course that we still don't know the full ... ramifications of that most likely came from the level 4 ... weapons lab in Wuhan that had ties to the US government to ... Bill Gates to Dr.  Fauci all the same people that are ... telling you yes go protest but don't you dare go out and ... enjoy a day in the park or try to make a living for yourself.  And as the medical professionals and ... experts have failed us while also destroying us what do ... you think people are going to do?  when there's no sports ... there's no schools there's no parks there's no way to even ... earn money or have your own business or even be able to ... work in most instances here in New York City.  But you're going to allow protests so obviously of ... course people will protest because it's one of the few ... things that you could actually do in this totalitarian ... smells like piss hellhole that is called New York City and ... again.  all of this wouldn't be possible if it wasn't for the ... mainstream media being the good repeaters that they are ... trying to keep you in a constant fear state which we ... need to speak out against because they are trying to ... create a world filled with fear and confusion.  and this is of ... course why we have a deep rooted untrust of the major ... institutions here in the United States.  by the way major ... institutions like you know Hollywood the mainstream ... media universities the technocrats that by the way ... are pushing the same ideology.  they are lockstep and barrel ... along with the same talking points and protest movement ... that they are now promoting.  and let's be honest here it's ... mainly a left-leaning ideology that these major ... institutions are promoting.  I mean just just look at ... Hollywood.  look at academia the colleges the universities ... look at the big tech companies Amazon Facebook ... Google.  look at all the major cities where a lot of this ... Baltimore and others New York City Los Angeles where the ... majority of these protests are taking place.  what's the ... common bond between all of these large institutions that ... keep talking about institutions of racism even ... though they are institutions themselves what is their ... common link?  well they purport themselves as believing in ... leftist ideologies.  they're the ones controlling culture and ... pushing this very limited viewpoint has created this ... situation that all of us are in right now.  a lot of them by ... the way that deflect a lot of the really horrible corrupt ... evil things that they're doing themselves including large ... multinational corporations like Amazon.  by the way don't ... all the injustices that Amazon creates but all these large ... structural institutions that portray themselves as the ... allies here.  there barely is any legitimate talk about ... their actions that has created these social economic ...
