            "text": "The Atheist Debates Patreon Project presents Why I Cancelled a Debate.  Hey, everybody.  I hope you're all doing well.  It's coming up on the end of July, and I wanted to talk about a couple of things.  First of all, I canceled a debate, a debate that was supposed to be happening August 15th or around there.  Originally, this was a joint venture.  I was on my way to Arkansas to meet with the Arkansas Free Thought community to do my Magic and Skepticism show, and someone reached out to me and said, hey, at the same time, there's like this apologist or Christian convention or something like that.  And they were wanting to know if you'd be interested in debating Dr.  James White.  And I thought, well, okay, I'm killing two birds with one stone.  Why not?  I'm going to be there anyway.  Let's do this.  Unfortunately, when the global pandemic hit, I've been locked in my house since pretty much mid-March, I guess, shortly after the D'Souza debate.  And I... thought that all of my gigs had been canceled.  And in fact, all of them had within the secular community.  The Arkansas Freethinkers group decided to postpone or cancel this actual event.  And other organizations were canceling similar debates.  And so I just assumed this thing was over.  It's just not gonna happen.  And a few weeks ago, an organizer reached out to me and said, hey, are you still coming on August 15th to debate Dr.  James White?  And I said, no, I thought this event was canceled.  And they said, no, no, no, the atheist event was canceled, but the theists are still getting together.  And while I don't know what the restrictions are in Arkansas, and I'm sure that their rate of infection is less than it is in Texas and other places, I pointed out that I would definitely not be traveling to go up there.  And they reached out and said, well, it's possible we could do this remotely.  And I said, all right, that's fine.  That's something I would certainly consider because after all, this is a paid debate.  I was going to be paid for this debate.  And during the lockdown, you know, with a number of other gigs getting canceled, it's money I could use.  And so I agreed to do it remotely.  And then I saw Dr.  White sharing anti-mask conspiracy theory videos on Twitter.  And I realized that I was going to be, even remotely, promoting someone who was supporting dangerous ideas and possibly an entire convention full of people who were opposed to wearing masks, etc.  And so I cancelled and said that there's no way that I'd be doing this debate.  Now, I could have just gone ahead and agreed to do it.  It's a paid debate.  I could use the money.  Why not do it?  I could have logged in remotely, spoken in a camera here.  I could have done it without pants on.  I could have taken that opportunity, if we talked about epistemology, to talk about the nature of evidence and then educate them on science and masks and even found a way to tie it into the debate responsibly.  Instead, I decided that I wouldn't be doing anything to promote the convention or Dr.  White.  Well, that prompted some interesting discussions on Twitter, specifically from the theists who had really, really been looking forward to this particular debate.  I had no idea that there were people who were this eager.  Evidently, I am something like, in their mind, I'm like the end boss of fights against atheism, because I was called a coward and a weasel, and it was claimed that I was running away from the biggest challenge of my career.  And I told Dr.  White that he was welcome to call the show and we could have a conversation another time, but I wouldn't be promoting the event.  Well, after he found out why I wasn't gonna debate him, he presented some articles that were supposedly there to support his position about the mask.  while accusing me of having some sort of ideological purity that would cause me to refuse to debate people unless they agreed with me.  Let me say that again.  He accused me of refusing to debate people unless they agreed with me.  Now, obviously, disagreement is kind of a key thing if you're going to actually be having a debate.  And I've debated tons of people who I disagree with on many things, as long as the subject of the debate is productive and something we disagree on.  But where I'm going to draw the line is, if you're actively promoting dangerous conspiracy theories during a global pandemic... when the United States is failing to improve the situation, has actually made it worse, and you're doing this at a time when despite some of us sheltering in place for months, Other people are proudly running around declaring this is a conspiracy.  or there's a cure or they don't have to do this or they have their freedoms.  If you're promoting that sort of dangerous conspiracy at that time, I don't want to know you.  I certainly don't want to engage you in a debate.  Maybe never.  Maybe somewhere down the line, if you were to realize that you were actively doing harm and apologize and make amends for it, maybe.  Who knows?  But the point is that in the middle of this pandemic, it would have been... intolerable and immoral, in my view, for me to promote this.  Now, what happens in a year, two years, three years, whatever else, I don't know.  But one of the, you know, I immediately was drawn to the fact that he accused me of only wanting to debate people who agreed with me, which is weird.  But he also sent along a couple of articles that were supposed to support his view.  One of them was about a study of cloth masks versus medical grade masks amongst healthcare workers in Vietnam.  And the study found that the cloth masks were not as effective as the medical grade masks.  And he thought this supported his conspiracy theory video.  The conspiracy theory video, by the way, claimed or asserted that masks were necessary and were merely a government tool to have a visual fear element for their control of the masses.  the paper that he cited didn't support any of that.  As a matter of fact, when it showed that the cloth masks were not effective as medical grade masks, I was wondering, why did we do this study at all?  We already knew that with regard to protecting the wearer, cloth masks are not as good as medical grade masks.  That's a non-issue.  So why was this even done?  And so Dr.  White doesn't seem to understand that wearing a mask is to protect others from you, And the social distancing is to protect everybody from everybody as best we can.  And that at no point were we suggesting that a cloth mask is as good as a medical grade mask.  And at no point were we talking about whether or not healthcare workers should wear a mask or what type of masks healthcare workers should wear.  We were talking about what human beings out and about in the real world should wear if they're going to be forced to interact with people, partly because of the long period of time that one can actually have this disease and not show signs or symptoms.  And because of that, you could have it, and so you wear the mask to protect others from you, irrespective of what Representative Louie Gohmert thinks about how he might have caught it from his mask.  Maybe he touched something and put it on the mask.  The anti-Science stuff is troubling.  And as a longtime skeptic, I've been doing my best to try to promote skepticism alongside humanism as I run around talking about atheism.  Because the skepticism and the humanism are far more important to me than atheism.  Atheism is just, hey, I'm not convinced there's a God.  And skepticism and humanism are about, how do you go about understanding reality?  And what are you going to do about living in it and making decisions to make a better world?  So after a number of accusations and this article, which was irrelevant, I wound up just blocking James White and the number of other mask holes who were basically just calling me a coward and everything else because I'm okay with the scientists.  Masks protects others from you.  It's ironic that the people who most seem to need to be wearing masks because of their anti-science, dangerous views increasing their likelihood of becoming ill are also the ones who are least likely to wear them.  Generally speaking, if I see someone who's running around wearing a mask all the time, I'm pretty confident that that person is taking precautions because they seem to be doing this stuff specifically to potentially care about other people.  I'm worried, for example, that Dr.  White doesn't understand the nature of debates, the burden of proof, science, evidence, and that he actively promoted dangerous conspiracy theories.  So that debate isn't actually happening.  But there are other debates which will be happening and other projects.  So stay tuned to the Atheist Debates Project.  There's more stuff coming.  There's more stuff coming within the next month or so, including the videos to get out.  And if that means that I end up having a lot of discussions with people who I, air quotes, agree with, So be it, because we can probably learn more from that than we can from yet another interaction with a precept.  who's also a raving conspiracy theorist who's encouraging dangerous views during a global pandemic.
