            "text": "I want to bring the conversation back to the broken criminal justice system that is disproportionately negatively impacting black and brown people all across this country today.  Now, Senator Harris says she's proud of her record as a prosecutor and that she'll be a prosecutor president, but I'm deeply concerned about this record.  There are too many examples to cite, but she put over 1500 people in jail for marijuana violations and then laughed about it when she was asked if she ever smoked marijuana.  She blocked evidence.  She blocked evidence that would have freed an innocent man from death row until the courts forced her to do so.  She kept people in prison beyond their sentences to use them as cheap labor for the state of California.  And she fought to keep a cash bail system in place that impacts poor people in the worst kind of way.  Bottom line is, Senator Harris, when you are in a position To make a difference and an impact in these people's lives, you did not.  And worse yet, in the case of those who were on death row, innocent people, you actually blocked evidence from being revealed that would have freed them until you were forced to do so.  There is no excuse for that.  And the people who suffered under your reign as prosecutor, you owe them an apology. ",
