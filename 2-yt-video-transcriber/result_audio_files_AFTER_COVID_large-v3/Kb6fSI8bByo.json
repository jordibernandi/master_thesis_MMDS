            "text": "hey what's up everybody?  this is Dante Fortson here with episode number two of strange stories in the Bible a spirit in the room.  so today's study is not gonna be super long.  we're just gonna touch on a very short story from the book of Job and we're gonna touch on a few interesting points about spirits.  but it's not gonna be a super long study.  But before we get into that, let's touch on the prayer request.  Yoruba said his prayer was answered for finances.  Shout out to Michael for following up with Yoruba on that.  Tanya Gets Real wants prayer for her family's health issues.  Yashica Black wants prayer for her husband's salvation and restored marriage.  Delois is asking for prayer because her family feels like it's being torn apart.  Nicole wants prayer for her anger problems.  Tracy is requesting prayer for her children's salvation.

And again, shout outs to Michael and Adrian for being in the forum and active and following up with people and praying for people.

 shall a man be more pure than his maker behold?  he put no trust in his servants and his angels.  he charged with folly.  how much less in them that dwell in houses of clay whose foundation is in the dust which are crushed before the moth.  they are destroyed from the morning to evening.  they perish forever without any regarding it.  doth not their excellency which is in them go away?  they die even without wisdom.  all right so that actually ends the chapter of Job.  now a lot of this is very very straightforward.  far as the Strong's Concordance goes.  there are a couple of observations that I made but most of this stuff is very very straightforward because the story is strange enough by itself.  so job's friend eliphaz says he's in a deep sleep in visions of the night.  now the word over here.  he said he was having disquieting or troubling thoughts.  that is a little bit deeper than what we see here where it says in thoughts from the visions of the night.  uh we we see that these thoughts that he's having are disturbing not just regular thoughts uh but the term deep sleep right here.  this is an interesting one because a deep sleep falls when deep sleep falls on men 86 39. now this deep sleep is the same kind of deep sleep we'll see in Genesis chapter 2 21 when God puts Adam to sleep and makes Eve from his rib 86 39 a deep sleep.  so Job's friend Eliphaz was in a super deep sleep when he had this vision and the vision disturbed him.  now people have different opinions about what he saw.  some people say it was God.  some people says the Holy Spirit.  some people say it was a ghost or a poltergeist.  some people say it was an angel but the fact is it's called a spirit and we're gonna talk about that for a second.  we're gonna talk about the concept of a ghost and we'll use the word apparition and the reason we use the word apparition because it just means as you see a ghost or ghost like image of a person the appearance of something remarkable or unexpected typically an image of this type.  so a ghost like a ghost or ghost like image of a person.  the reason we use this word is because the description Eliphaz is about to give in a second.  so we look at the word ghost and the ghost definition says an apparition of a dead person which is believed to appear or become manifest to the living typically as a nebulous image.  now again I'm not saying this is a ghost I'm just pointing out some things that are said and we're just looking at some definitions.  so so far it fits the definition of an apparition a ghost-like image of a person and we're gonna see in a second it says their appearance of something remarkable or unexpected typically an image of this type.  so again this this apparition or this spirit fits the definition.  the ghost an apparition of a dead person who is believed to appear become manifest to the living typically a as a nebulous image.  so let's look.  I looked up the word nebulous and nebulous says this in the form of a cloud or haze hazy of a concept or idea unclear vague or ill-defined.  so that doesn't fit.  but it does fit in a form of a cloud or haze hazy.  so we see that right here job 416. he says it stood still but i could not discern the form thereof.  so it's formless or he doesn't know what form.  this he said and an image was before mine eyes.  there was silence.  this is an important part.  right here there was silence.  now before we get to that he calls.  he calls this spirit right here.  in verse 15 he calls it a spirit.  the word right here is rock.  we're gonna see this.  7307. the word is rock and we're gonna see that the hair stood up on his body.  now this word right here 81 85. the hair stood up.  we'll concentrate on that for just a second and then we're gonna come back.  well see the hair not 81 85. this is for hair stood up 55 68. we're gonna concentrate on this for a moment.  now.  when people have these kind of supernatural encounters if you watch any of the ghost hunter shows or any of the the medium or psychic shows or anything like that people will often report that their hair stood up on the back of their neck or their arm.  their hair stood up is usually associated with emfs electromagnetic fields and they say that the electricity in the atmosphere changes when these spirits appear or are around and again.  this is according to these ghost hunter shows and personal experiences that people have claimed to have had.  some of us have felt this feeling of being in fear and then feeling like the hair is standing up or even seeing the hair stand up on our body.  now this is the same word here.  right here stood up 5568. it's the same word used right here translated as trembles and this is in reference to fear of the Lord's judgment.  I'm afraid of your judgment.  my flesh trembles for fear of you.  so this is a deep deep fear that came upon Eliphaz.  when this spirit appeared to him now again they couldn't discern his appearance.  it was in a nebulous form as I pointed out.  that's why some people believe it may have been a ghost.  now let me go back just a little bit.  so there's silence and this is this is interesting that he calls attention to the fact that there was silence and then he hears a voice.  he heard a voice.  now there's a reason that the silence seems to be emphasized.  i'm not saying this is 100 why but it seems to be a logical reason.  because he wants to draw attention to the fact that there was nothing else going on nothing else being said.  but then something loud and sudden is going to happen.  we see that this is 69 63 a voice and a voice.  but we get over here a sound of voice this definition and we get to the exhaustive concordance.  we see um birds bleeding crackling cry crying growl listening loudly loudness lowing noise.  obey we get that outcry proclamation screamed.  so this is very likely a loud sound.  so he wants to give you the contrast that this spirit came in stood before him he couldn't make out the form it was silent and then all of a sudden it yelled or or spoke in a very loud voice to him and said The following shall a mortal man be more just than God.  Shall a man be more pure than his maker?  Behold, he put no trust in his servants and his angels.  He charged with folly.  How much less than them that dwell in the house of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, which are crushed before the moth.  They are destroyed from morning to evening.  They perish forever without any regarding it.  Doth not their excellency, which is in them, go away?  They die even without wisdom.  So this spirit appears, scares the crap out of Eliphaz and then gives him a message, which he clearly does not forget.  Now, there are a few observations that I noticed in here as I was going through.  The same word Ruach is used in First Kings 22.  We talked about the lying spirit.  It does not call this spirit an angel, even though people believe it's an angel.  Same as in First Kings 22.  The spirits there were not called angels.  The terms all the host of heaven was used.  And then it tells us that.  this ruach came forward and volunteered to be a lying spirit which means it was not originally or it's not in the official capacity of a lying spirit now.  one of the other things we noticed too is that it was able in in first kings it was able to possess or or go control the mouth of the prophets.  this spirit although it does not have a form still managed to speak and make a sound and interact with the physical world to the point that eliphaz could hear it.  so we we see that is common to when people um what they refer to as hauntings.  we see that we people hear voices and all kind of other stuff.  that goes on now in 418 where it says behold he put no trust in his servants and his angels he charged with folly.  there's intentionally a different words used here.  um strong's 4397. you can go to biblehub.com.  uh type in uh job chapter 4 verse 18. click interlinear and you can see for yourself that the word used is malak versus the word rock which is used above in verse 15. so it is clearly a differentiation between angels and this being.  and also notice that this being high speaks about God.  it's it's.  uh let me see let's read it here shall mortal man be more just than god?  shall a man be more pure than his maker?  behold he put no trust in his servants and his angels.  he charged with folly.  he seems to be speaking as in the third person which isn't strange.  god does it sometimes in the bible.  so it doesn't necessarily prove that this is not god but it seems to indicate that this may not be god or is very likely not god appearing to eliphaz.  it is likely some other spirit that maybe volunteered to go down to speak to eliphaz.  based on what we saw in first kings 22 that there was a council and somebody volunteered to go down it's possible that there was a council.  it's possible that the spirit acted on its own.  it's possible that the spirit was sent from god.  it's kind of hard to tell based on the text but it also gives us some interesting insight to Luke 24 39. behold my hands and my feet that it is I myself handle me and see for a spirit hath not flesh and bones as ye see me have.  this is Christ talking to Thomas and some of the other disciples but this is Christ and this is after the resurrection when they think he is a ghost or a spirit and they're actually kind of trembling afraid of him.  and then he asked them for something to eat and then he eats in front of them.  they gave him a boiled fish i think it broiled broiled fish and a honeycomb and he ate in front of them.  but they thought he was a ghost or a spirit.  let me let me um change that so.  they thought he was a spirit.  now it's interesting that they differentiated between angels and spirits.  and as we get into the demon ology and angel ology study when I do start those I'm gonna point out some of the differences in the word and how they use the word spirit.  you'll find that sometimes they use the word spirit and sometimes they use the word unclean spirit And it's a very slight difference.  But if you watch the Nephilim Giants part one, I pointed out.  that the unclean spirits the definition in Greek actually refers to a spirit of a wrong mixture or wrongly mixed spirit.  so go check out Nephilim Giants part 1 if you want to get deeper into the wrongly mixed spirits.  but yeah this story just kind of stands out because it's one appearance of what appears to be a ghost in the Bible.  it's called a spirit but it does have all the elements of what we would call a typical haunting.  well not all the elements.  it has a few of the elements of a typical haunting and I think in part three.  I'm gonna cover Peters escape from prison in which an angel appears and we see some signs there that are very synonymous with alien abduction.  and it's just again.  it goes to the point that a lot of the stuff that we think is new or not explained in the bible is actually in the bible.  and to be clear for those that don't know my position on aliens i do believe that they are fallen angels.  i do believe a lot of this stuff comes from the spirit realm and it's not all explained as beings coming from other planets.  so yeah we'll get more into that when I get into the angels and demons studies but I did want to point this out.  so make sure you grab your copy of as the days of nowhere.  make sure you grab a copy of beyond flesh and blood if you want to get more into spirits and supernatural entities.  there are other strange stories in the Bible like this one offs that give us slight insight into the spiritual realm and that there are other things out there besides just angels and humans.  so if you like the video click the thumbs up make sure you subscribe make sure you click the notification bell so you don't miss any future studies.  and with that said until next time i'm out.
