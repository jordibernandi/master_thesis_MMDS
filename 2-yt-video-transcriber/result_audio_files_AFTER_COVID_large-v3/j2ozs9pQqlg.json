            "text": "Mr.  President, if we don't act now, it's going to be too late.  In 89, he predicted Panta, and it hit.  The chances of this virus showing up in the U.S.  are virtually nil.  It's one person coming in from China, and we have it under control.  It's going to be just fine.  If there is nothing else, meeting a child.  No.  No.  You take a solid flu vaccine, you don't think that would have an impact or much of an impact on Corona?  No.  Excuse me, sir.  Another ice for me.  Oh, not to worry.  Quite normal for this time of year.  You know, a lot of people think that goes away in April with the heat, as the heat comes in.  I think the true number is much, much higher.  There's no place for alarmist hysteria.  It's not alarmist if it's a fact.  Well, I don't hear any facts at all.  All I hear is a man I don't know engaging in conjecture, in direct contradiction to what has been reported by party officials.  Now the Democrats are politicizing... The coronavirus.  And this is their new hoax.  Luckily, the press is making up their own story at this point.  But that's not going to keep.  I think the 3.4% is really a false number.  Now, this is just my hunch.  With all due respect, Mr.  Vice President, the cost of doing nothing could be even higher.  It's going to disappear one day.  It's like a miracle.  It will disappear.  Guys, will I keep you out of the loop, huh?  No, I don't take responsibility at all.  You said that you don't take responsibility, but you did disband the White House pandemic office.  So what responsibility do you take to that?  Well, I just think it's a nasty question.  Now what do we do?  Address the nation.  There's going to be a lot of frightened people out there.  My fellow Americans, tonight I want to speak with you about our nation's unprecedented response to the coronavirus outbreak.  We're clear.  Okay.  Okay. ",
