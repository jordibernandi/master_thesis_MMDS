These rocks form the core of the continent down deep, somehow related to creation week, I believe.

And this beveled surface is rather obvious in the back of us, but the flat-lying 4,000 feet of strata sits on this erosion surface, and that's called the Great Unconformity.

And Adam Sedgwick, a catastrophist geologist, and Charles Lyell, a uniformitarian geologist, those were the two primary teachers of Charles Darwin.  And Charles Darwin received his education believe it or not, in geology.  He was trained by geologists.  And then he went on to write some papers for about 10 years till he got sick with some type of general illness.  He participated in field trips and did a lot of geology.  He wrote geologic papers.  And so Charles Darwin was trained by geologists.  He performed as a geologist.  He thought like a geologist.  And for his early career, he was a geologist, obviously.  He had Rockhammer.  He did geologic maps.  He drew stratigraphic cross-sections.  Darwin is a geologist just like me.  So I can challenge that paradigm system of Darwin.  But Darwin went on to influence the worldview in a very... different way.  He went into biology and started applying and thinking about natural selection and evolution of species.  And when that happened, that whole paradigm shifted.  And of course, today, we're going back and we're remembering, I'm remembering that Charles Darwin was a geologist, and we need to go back and challenge the foundation of his way of thinking. ",

We have solution, the river is actually dissolving away in a very weak way the rock.  Abrasion, that's where particle impacts particle going down the river.  The third agent of erosion is a catastrophic agent.  It's called plucking.  When fluid flow in the riverbed gets so big, it's able to flush all the rocks in the channel.  That energy can be expended on prying the cracks of the rock in the channel apart.  It's called hydraulic plucking.  And the ultimate example is an underwater tornado, essentially.  Catastrophic flow can generate that. ",

When water flows very rapidly, like about 20 feet per second down a channel, velocity allows vacuum bubbles to form, especially in downstream of an obstacle.  The water flow going over that obstacle creates low pressure.  When that pressure gets low enough, it gets to what's called the vapor pressure of water, then water is torn open and a cavity is formed in that water.  That's a vacuum bubble.  That vacuum bubble can collapse or implode, and it's next to a rock, and when it implodes, it's like dynamite.  A catastrophic erosion by cavitation, this process of collapse of bubbles, is well understood by engineers, especially in spillways and tunnels. ",
