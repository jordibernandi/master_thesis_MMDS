            "text": "Thanks so much.  That answers my question.  Thanks, Soledad.  You keep on being a grown-up.  Bye, Raya.  When you make a decision, it can affect you and other people too.  And sometimes more than one decision can be right.  What?  Pearlene went to find out what the kid on the street thinks.  I'm Pearlene and I'm going to find out what hard choices kids have to make in their lives.  What was the last big decision you had to make?  I had to choose what song I should play on the piano.  Whether to watch shows or make smoothies.  I had to pick between a soccer final game or a dance competition.  Probably the decision to do online learning.  What were the results on your decision?  I said, yeah, let's do online learning because I know I'm safe and I'm also having fun too.  I picked dance because I knew that I did soccer almost every day.  I took this purpose because school is like once in a year chance.  You don't get it every day.  One directed correspondence is with someone who's making a big choice.  Let's go live with Marcus on the scene.  Breaking news, Ava can't make a decision about ice cream.  Ice cream, get your ice cream here.  How can I help you?  Which one do you want?  Maybe I should get the ice cream cookie sandwich because that's like two desserts in one.  Or maybe I should get the red, white, and blue ice bar because it's almost selection day.  The push pop ice cream bar.  Watermelon.  It shouldn't be this hard.  It's just ice cream.  Do what I did when I was a kid.  Use a decision tree.  What's a decision tree?  It helps you decide on things.  A decision tree helps you figure out your options.  You write each of your choices on a branch.  Then you add the pros and the cons of each option.  Once the pros outweigh the cons, you've got your decision.  Do you have a decision, Tree, so I can pick ice cream?  Uh, sure.  Do you want your ice cream to be yellow or green?  Another decision!  Looks like we're gonna be here for a while.  Raya, back to you.  Decisions, decisions, decisions.  My girl, Perlene, found a kid who made a really big decision, and I think we can learn a thing or two from him.  His name is Ryan.  He's from Maine, and he's an Eagle Scout.  If you're an Eagle Scout, you have to do a big project to help the community.  Ryan, we got one.  Ryan decided for his project, he was going to help the kids in his city get laptops so they could do school online.  He's here with us right now.  Thanks for joining us, Ryan. ",

Let's go live to the scene.  I'm still on the sidelines with Ava right here, and she is still struggling to make a decision.  I've narrowed it down to two choices, the cherry snow cone or the ice cream sandwich.  I think this is going to work out fine, and it'll help me make a decision.  Yeah, it's really good, because then you don't have to worry about consequences.  Consequences?  Don't go anywhere.  We'll be right back.  Thanks, guys.  The decision tree is a great way to help us decide what to do.  But are there other ways to make a tough decision?  One thing I like to do is talk to my mom.  We can learn a lot from older generations, but do not take my word for it.  Take theirs.  Mom, can I ask you some questions?  Of course you can.  What do you do when you have to make a big decision?  I spend some time, think about it, Think of pros and cons.  I like to sleep on it.  And then I put all that together and come up with my answers.  So what's a big decision you had to make lately? ",

He does it with one egg, a cup of sugar, and a lot of love.  Meet Michael, kid business owner.  He has always loved to cook and he's always wanted to help people in his community.  When he was 11, he put those things together and started his company.  It's a bakery with an extra sweet mission.  For every cupcake he sells, he donates another to feed the homeless.

Should we have a dance party or should we have a dance party?  Dance party.  Meep, meep, meep, meep, meep, meep, meep.  Dance away.  So now that we all know how to make decisions, I want to know what happens when I have a friend and we don't agree.  We'll find out in our next episode.  See you there!  You can do jazz hands this way or this way.  I watched a lot of shows that do jazz hands.  No, those aren't jazz hands.  These are jazz hands.  Uh-oh.  Maybe the star just doesn't like being out there.  Breaking news here!  This seems suspicious.  Everyone has the same shoes!  That's so true!  Oh, the saying of that word got my tongue in a tie.  See?  I believe it.  How do you feel about having to make tough decisions?  That's a hard word.  Your mustache is fine, man.  You're not rolling anymore.  Wait, are you rolling?  Wait, train.
