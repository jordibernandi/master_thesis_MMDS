            "text": "Her kids, her kids' extracurricular activities, the cat, the vet bill with the cat, and then maybe, you know, you come in like fifth, sixth, or seventh, or something like that.  But often what ends up happening, fellas, is you're really not that much of a priority to her.  Got a crazy video for you today.  She's not yours.  It's just your turn.  A woman should be a compliment to your life, not the focus.  Do the work.  Women do not care about your struggles.  They hang out at the finish line and they pick the winners.  What is up, my brothers from another mother?  Listen, in this video, I want to cover an important topic when it comes to five important things you guys need to recognize when it comes to getting involved in a long-term basis with single moms.  So let's hop straight into this because over the course of the years, I've done a lot of coaching calls with the guys and I've got a call book next week with a guy that's very high profile, makes over a quarter million dollars a year, very successful in his field, but he's very, very badly tied up.  on a single mom that basically abandoned him, left him.  He's got one-itis for it.  So let's hop into the five things.  Now, before we go into it, I wanna say this.  Yes, I know there's some ladies out there that are gonna be like, not all women are like that.  There's unicorns out there.  Congratulations, your unicorn ribbon is in the mail.  It's coming your way.  But on a balance of probabilities, these are the five most important things, guys, that you really, really need to be a hell of a lot more attentive to so you don't wind up in a situation where you can't function or you have some issues getting over a lost one, usually the single mom.  Number one, cuckoldry.  Now, if you're not familiar with what cuckoldry is, this is probably one of the biggest factors that most smart guys when they're navigating the sexual marketplace will pass on single moms because usually the biggest reward when it comes to children is the fact that they carry your DNA and your last name.  It's such an important thing that when you get into Hollywood pieces or media pieces that involve royalty or anything that's regal.  For example, let's take Game of Thrones as a recent example.  You heard throughout the entire series, well, he's not a Stark.  And that's what the... consistency is when it comes to cuckoldry is yeah it is important but it's so important to men as fathers that they know that their name is passed on right.  they know that their name carries meaning and that name with its DNA is passed on.  and when you get involved with a single mom and you start to raise her kids you're basically raising another man's children.  you're a cuck.  There's animals in the wild that'll basically drop their eggs in the nest of other birds.  Birds, you know, more specifically.  And those dumb birds will raise the eggs that are hatched as their own.  They don't pay attention to the details.  And that's really what guys get themselves into when they get wound up with single moms.  is they end up getting cuckolded where they end up essentially applying their tools and resources and everything to the genetic investment of another man.  It's not particularly rewarding.  It's often used as a disparaging term on the internet these days.  It's usually the number one reason why most guys pass on it.  And if that's not enough for you, I got four more coming your way.  Number two, so the second problem with getting involved in a long-term basis with single moms, fellas, is you've got 100% responsibility with 0% authority.  What I mean by that is when the children, her children specifically, need something, resources, your time to fix something, car's broken, tuition's due for college or university or something like that, they're our children.  But when it comes time to discipline them or to enforce boundaries, most guys often find that they're her children at that time.  And that's not a great deal for guys because you're basically used like an ATM.  You're used to facilitate her new world order, the conditions that she wants her children to live in, to benefit from specifically.  So understand that if you do get involved with a single mom, not only one are you being cucked, but number two, for the most part, you're going to end up having 100% responsibility with no authority.  Now, That's just the tip of the iceberg.  if you're involved in the relationship.  Usually it doesn't end there.  Usually it lasts a little bit longer, especially if you're living in a way that the state determines would be considered a marriage, whether it's common law, whatever it is that it's going to be called where you live in the world.  But there's many, many cases that I've come across where a guy gets involved with a woman with children in tow from a prior relationship or relationships in some case.  Sometimes it's many kids from several different fathers.  And And, you know, they're together for a few years.  And for whatever reason, things don't work out.  She wants to bounce and ends the relationship.  He may have during that period of time paid off all of her debt, paid for tuition, school, things for her kids.  And he can be on the hook over the long term for child support for children that aren't even his.  I don't know if there is a greater reason why you should consider avoiding getting deeply involved with single mothers than that, but that alone, if the state is gonna make you or hold you accountable and responsible, for children that you did not father, it's absolutely absurd to me, men knowing this, there's no excuse once you know this, but knowing this would continue to pursue a long-term relationship with a single mom.  Now, some guys will do it.  It's usually because they either aren't aware of the details, one, or two, it's low-hanging fruit and it's an easy option for them, right?  It's easy to get into it.  Let's move on to number three.  All right.  So the third one is the victim mindset.  This is an interesting one.  So I'll put a card up on the top, right?  From my experience dating a single mother, you should check that video out after you finished watching this.  Uh, I recorded it about four years ago.  And one thing that you need to understand is that I have not come across a woman, uh, that had children in tow from a prior relationship that did not, um, subscribe to a victim mindset.  Um, It's quite common in the narratives that toxic feminism suggests to women.  because the problem with that version of today's toxic feminism is it tends to encourage women to be the victim.  Like there's always some oppressor holding them down.  There's a patriarchy.  There's somebody that's doing the exact same job that's making a dollar for every 70 odd cents that she earns.  There's always some narrative around that.  And if you're involved with somebody that has a victim mindset, People with a victim mindset simply cannot be happy.  They're always gonna be looking for an oppressor.  They're always gonna be looking for a villain.  Anybody seeking a villain in life is always gonna have a hard time with that.  Now, you may not immediately be who she deems to be that problem or that villain, for example, but at some point in the future, you're a man, she's a woman, and feminism isn't particularly warm to masculinity in men these days, if you haven't noticed, You need to be aware that there's going to be issues with victim mindset.  Now, that's not just something you're going to have to deal with her.  You're also going to end up dealing with it with her children.  Let me give you a good example.  So we talked earlier about authority without responsibility.  If you want to exercise some authority, let's say, and enforce some boundaries.  Let's say her kids are behaving badly.  Maybe they're becoming bratty.  They're maybe a little entitled.  There's something that requires some, you know, reeling in.  You know, you got to put some boundaries around it and you try to enforce them.  A lot of the times, because the kid's mom already subscribes to a victim mindset... They're automatically going to default to that because that's what they know.  They're children.  They don't know any better, right?  They're always a product of their environment.  So if mom subscribes to a victim mindset, has issues with patriarchy or whatever narrative that she might be using, her ex is a bum, he is a loser, which is an interesting thing, by the way, because she's the one that picked him.  You know, at the end of the day, she's the one that decided to, you know, it's men that propose to women and she says I do.  So why would she do that?  But that's that's an entirely different topic.  But at the end of the day, the kids will also use nearly the same strategy on their mom.  And then again, that's when you'll find that, you know, you you've got.  kids that are no longer ours, but they're now hers.  And when you try to enforce the boundaries, the emotional manipulation that comes out of that with her, with her kids is going to be problematic for you.  It's going to be exhausting.  All right, let's move on to number four.  So number four is financial issues.  From my experience, like I'm an entrepreneur, I have multiple sources of income.  My experience in the dating pool and in a lot of these guys that I've coached that have run into problems with women on the sexual marketplace.  when it comes to getting involved with single moms, they don't work high-end paying jobs.  Most of them don't anyway, if I'm being honest.  They, for the most part, will select professions like teaching, nursing, child care giving, reception, you know, aesthetics things, you know, stuff like that.  They're not particularly high paying jobs.  And if they've got kids in tow, they're often, one, usually fighting with their ex for access to money and the children.  Which actually brings another problem I can touch on very briefly.  You end up dealing with custody overwhelm because still in this day, women get about 80% of the custody orders awarded to them.  So that means the kids are going to be with her most of the time.  There's a lot of guys that find themselves in a scenario where they end up not only being cocked raising another man's kids, but he may in fact, if he has kids, if he's divorced, end up spending more time with another man's kids than he gets to spend with his own because his ex is has custody most of the time as well.  So the dynamic of that is bizarre.  But coming back to the financial issues, most women don't have a whole lot to show for themselves when you meet them and they've got kids in tow.  I haven't met that many personally myself.  And of course, most of the guys that I've coached that have been dealing with problems exiting a long-term relationship or even a marriage if they got involved with one with a single mom, are often, of course, the breadwinners because of hypergamy, right?  You know, women always like to marry up, date up.  It's the same thing.  If she's left the kid's father and she's looking for another guy, it's generally speaking, what he's looking, what she's looking for is some kind of beta provider, right?  Somebody that's reliable, that has a good job, you know, has access to resources that would be useful to her and her kids, for example.  So the It's not like you guys are gonna find yourself splitting bills.  What'll usually end up happening is some story or some narrative's gonna come out about how her kids wanna meet you, then you start going out, and you're no longer buying her dinner.  You're buying her and her kids dinner.  You're no longer taking a vacation with her down south.  All of a sudden, her kids are in tow, and you're looking after them, you're feeding them, you're entertaining them, which gives you a lot less time for yourself.  All right.  And the fifth and last one that I want to cover is the reprioritization of your time and your purpose in life.  If you guys have followed me for a while on my channel, you guys know that I'm often talking about finding your purpose, putting a dent in the universe and making sure that you've got some impact in life.  And one of the things that you'll notice will end up happening if you do get involved with a single mom and ignore my advice is you're going to end up having to reprioritize yourself in the pecking order.  I always tell guys that if you're going to allow a woman to enter your life, she should be a compliment to it and not the focus.  Often what will end up happening when guys get involved with single moms, again, it's usually because they have a lack of options or they're only able to get the low-hanging fruit.  They end up putting themselves in a position where they're no longer their own mental point of origin, meaning with every choice, with every decision they make, they consider themselves first.  But they end up putting themselves behind her, her job, the crazy chick from the accounting department that she bitches about every day, her kids, her kids' extracurricular activities, the cat, the vet bill with the cat.  And then maybe, you know, you come in like 5th, 6th, or 7th, or something like that.  But often what ends up happening, fellas, is you're really not that much of a priority to her.  She's going to disagree with me on this, of course, because it doesn't look good if you end up putting yourself in a bad position where... You're no longer your own mental point of origin.  There's a lot of pointing and sputtering that you guys are going to find in the comments at this point.  You're going to see a lot of angry women saying, well, that's not true, or they're going to make ad hom attacks on me.  Here's the thing, guys.  I've not met a single, single mom where it would have been worth my while to get involved in it.  there there's.  there's a lot of other potential problems that could come out of getting involved beyond the five that i've mentioned there.  i'll give you a real quick example.  let's say that you're a dad and you got a daughter and she's young.  the biggest risk to little girls is in blended families.  when they get involved and they've got step siblings that might potentially assault or violate her it happens quite a lot.  So you have to have your wits about you and consider that it's probably better for you guys if you're going to get involved with a single mom.  You do it on a very limited basis.  If guys ask me, I'm usually quite honest with them.  I'll say play them, don't date them, and certainly do not move in with them or live in a way that the state looks like or that the state could view as a marriage.  So be decisive and firm with boundaries when it comes to stuff like this.  Your greatest ROI, fellas, is gonna be investing in yourself, doubling down on becoming a better version of yourself, and of course, You know, making more money, making bank, making more muscles, learning new skills if you're not involved in combat sports.  Those are the sorts of things that I would encourage you to do because if you're forced or you find yourself stuck with low-hanging fruit more often than not, it's because your value is not high enough.  Now, a lot of guys will argue with me and say, Rich, that's all there is out on the dating market.  That's all I can get.  I'm 38.  I'm divorced.  I got kids in tow.  What am I supposed to do?  Well, if you're in real good shape and you're a top shelf sort of guy, there's really no reason why you couldn't get involved with women that are in their mid-20s that don't have any kids in tow.  There are some women in their 30s that don't have kids in tow.  It's entirely up to you.  Like I always say in my videos, men are masters of complicating their lives and then justifying why they do it.  Stop doing that.  Be more intentional about the decisions that you make.  Do me one favor before we wrap up this video.  Somebody probably needs to see this that you know.  Take this video, send it to them.  Post it somewhere and let people see that there are better ways that they can navigate life and approach the sexual marketplace.  and hold themselves to higher standards.  Basically, guys, have some dignity.  You can do better if you invest in yourself.  Don't let somebody else make their problems your problems.  Understand that you are a man and you are the prize.  Far too many guys will bend the knee and they'll worship women.  Women are not particularly rare.  Beautiful women are not particularly in high demand.  What's in the high demand is strong, virtuous, masculine, competent man that can make bank, that have made muscles, you know, good looking guys that have their shit together, that understand game and live their life with intention and with red pill awareness.  That's what's rare.  That's what's in high demand, truthfully.  So when you assess that with yourself, you're going to do better.  Smash the like button.  Leave me a comment below.
