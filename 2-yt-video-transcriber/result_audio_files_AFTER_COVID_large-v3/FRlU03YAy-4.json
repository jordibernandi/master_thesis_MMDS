            "text": "Hey folks, it's Patriot Nurse.  Thank you for joining me today.  I want to discuss with us today just very briefly general security considerations.  I'm coming at this as a woman, okay, specifically, and I want to appeal to families, not only heads of families out there, but also ladies who are listening to me.  If you have been paying attention to the news, obviously you've seen with increase in riots, I'm not calling it protests because they're riots.  When you have destruction of property, when you have violation of rights, when you have burning of places, and when you have violence committed against uninvolved citizenry, that is a riot.  That's no longer a peaceable assembly petitioning the government for redress of grievances.  In many different cities around the country, we are seeing right now, unfortunately, more and more problems compounding as the election keeps coming closer and closer and i don't think that this is going to get any better.  actually i think it's going to get worse probably and there's some practical considerations here.  the first is if you are going out in public right now especially if you're in a larger city, it's imperative that you carry a firearm with you.  I'm a big believer that everyone who is reasonably capable and has the desire to should be able to carry a firearm.  I mean, it's the second amendment, you know, that a well-regulated militia, you and I are the militia.  Okay.  Like the militia is not some wordy dirt and it's not some, you know, long defunct institution.  The militia is you and me.  The militia is neighbors being responsible for protecting their community.  And that's what we are as responsible citizens.  That's what we are.  We are responsible to ourselves.  And also we are responsible to other people for our behavior.  And if someone's life is being jeopardized by a group of bloodthirsty thugs, who are waving whatever banner of political activism they can to cloak and shroud their vampiristic desire to slaughter people, we need to be able to rise to the occasion and to defend our community.  So carrying your firearm with you, I think, is very important.  As a practical matter, if you needed any more... clarification on the role of rifles in the defense of the citizenry.  the Kenosha news coming out with with the Kenosha Kyle and the the shooting surrounding it that to me shows overwhelmingly the necessity of the militia and of the citizenry to be able to defend themselves and rifles are a big part of this because when you've got a mob surrounding you yeah you can do the job defending yourself with a sidearm but you better place your your your.  You better lace your rounds right exactly in the magical triangle here if you want to immediately and swiftly stop the threat.  With rifles, you've got capacity.  that at least gives you more time to be able to deal with a greater number of people as opposed to changing magazines in the midst of things.  So as a practicality here, a lot of people are traveling right now for... for vacation and for family time and they're going different places around the country right now.  if you are leaving your home and if you're leaving your city i would recommend that as best as reasonably possible that you take your rifles with you because you do not want to be caught in some city even though for instance like with kenosha It may be fine when you leave home, but in the interim, you could be coming back through something unbeknownst to you.  Google Drive reroutes you through something, and then lo and behold, you're stuck in the middle of a war zone, and you need to be able to defend your family.  So if you've got a minivan full of kids, you need to be able to defend yourself, your entire family, and ladies, specifically with us.  We are the protectors of our children.  I'm a big believer in traditional masculinity and the husbands protecting the wives and children.  But ladies, we also have the ability to care for our own.  And as best as possible, we need to be able to defend ourselves, our family, and our communities.  So I encourage you all.  not to grow complacent.  And especially as believers, okay, I'm breaking spades on this one.  Let us not be compulsively naive and thinking, oh, well, the Lord protects me.  Listen, faith is not in question here.  Due diligence on our part is in question here.  I hear the story once about the rabbi telling the story.  You know, the guy who stranded on a desert island, and he prays that the Lord will deliver him.  And then, you know, he sees that there's a boat that passes by him the first day.  And he's like, well, they're not coming up to the island, so I'll just keep praying, Lord.  And then the next day, it's like a boat and an aircraft buzzing over.  He's like, well, they didn't land here.  And so then by the third day, the guy hasn't had any water and he's gasping his last breaths.  It's like, God, I prayed.  Why didn't you answer me?  And God responds back to him in the story.  I sent you two boats and a plane.  What was your problem?  So friends, we have the ability to defend ourselves, but let us not be compulsively naive.  There are brutal, vicious, vile, and evil people out there.  And there's a lot of them right now running around with Antifa flags.  I'm not saying that they have a monopoly on evil, but if you want the face of evil in the United States right now, you're looking at it.  You're looking at it.  And we need to be able to defend ourselves in case evil finds us.  We don't go looking for it.  Good people don't go looking to cause trouble.  Evil preys upon good people.  Evil depends.  In order for evil to triumph, good people must do nothing.  Good people must be lambs to the slaughter.  And that is not us.  That's not me.  That's not you.  We need to be responsible for our area.  So I wanted to encourage you all with this short video today to be vigilant, to be alert.  but also friends to make sure if you have your rifle make sure your rifle is lubed.  make sure that it's zero and you know where your rounds hit meaning you know which ammunition hits with your rifle you know where it hits and you can put faith in its ability to execute what you want it to do.  so have a lubed rifle know where it hits and make sure that it's zeroed.  also if you needed any reminder that you must have a sling on your rifle watch the kenosha nonsense because god forbid If you get hit in the head and your hands do what most human beings do to try and break their fall open up and you lose that rifle, it's game over.  slings on rifles are critical, okay?  So make sure that you have that done and also make sure that you have a good way to carry your pistol.  Ladies, I have a video which I'll try and link to up here in the card and that video is women's pistol carry.  that doesn't suck and I have links in that video.  I show you how I carry my pistol and some options for you that don't involve you completely retooling your wardrobe into some androgynous, you know, gender confused selection of garments.  So I hope that was helpful for y'all today.  Definitely a time to be in prayer, y'all.  It's going to be, I think, the pressure valve is going to get ratcheted up as we go by within the weeks leading up to the election.  So make sure, friends, that you have checked to make sure you're subscribed because YouTube has been unsubscribing people from my channel and I have not.  Well, I have an idea why.  I can't say I don't know why.  I know why.  It happens.  It happens.  Make sure that you're subscribed.  Make sure that you click that bell button so that way you know if I put a video out and if I go live with a live stream, that way you know and you don't miss anything.  Also, friends, if you needed a reminder that self-care is the new health care, and that you don't want to wait and delay to learn today what you're going to need tomorrow, check out my class.  It's four hours, $129.  You get a downloadable workbook.  Go at your own pace.  You can look at the description box below, and I've got a link, the Patriot Nurse Academy, okay?  So patriotnurseacademy.com.  The description for the course is there, everything you guys need to know.  We need to be able to care for our families at home.  We need to be able to lock down and secure our own perimeter and take care of our family's needs without venturing out if evil seeks us out and if it comes looking for us.  I hope it was helpful for y'all.  May the Lord bless and keep each and every one of you and have a very blessed and wonderful weekend.  For now, it's Patriot Nurse signing off and I'll see y'all later.  Bye. ",
