            "text": "Right, guess who's coming back to the UK?  potentially?  Shamima.  Yes, the girl who left Britain, moved to Syria, caused some chaos, and then when her side lost, she said, I want to come back home to the UK.  I miss home.  I didn't know what I was thinking.  I didn't know that, you know, even though, you know, she was 15, 16, she didn't know the difference between right and wrong.  Yeah, so we had some senior judges in the UK deciding and ruling that she should be able to come back to appeal when it comes to her British citizenship.  Now, the problem we have is that a lot of people in the UK are upset.  Priti Patel, the Home Secretary, is going to act on it.  She's going to try to stop Shamima from coming back.  But we have a Labour Party that have always been quite friendly towards these people, towards the enemies of the UK.  The current leader of the Labour Party is Keir Starmer.  And Keir Starmer said this a while ago when the Home Secretary removed Shamima's citizenship.  He actually defended Shamima and he said that Shamima should come back to the UK. ",

            "text": "I think the decision by the Home Secretary was the wrong decision, and I think it was a rushed decision, and I think it left out of account the interests of the newly born child, who's tragically died.  I think the Home Secretary also should have really looked at what powers were available to him to deal with the case if it came back.  Alternatively, if there's not enough evidence, if she came back and there wasn't enough evidence to prosecute, you can also have a prevention order, which is where you can't prosecute, but you think measures are necessary.

            "text": "Well, they need to be assessed when they come back.  Security and intelligence forces can do that, and they do do that, and they're very good at it.  If there are offences, the mere fact that it was abroad makes no difference.  You can be prosecuted here.  But as I say, if on analysis it was found there wasn't enough evidence... the Home Secretary could then have said, well, what about a prevention order which limits what an individual can do back in this country?  So, actually, had the interest of the child been taken properly into account, I think we would see that this was a wrong decision and a rushed decision by the Home Secretary. ",

            "text": "I mean, this is absolutely nonsense because he says we need evidence that she did something bad.  She's already admitted all the things that she's done and all the trainings that she's received.  She's already admitted.  You don't need evidence.  But now she's saying, obviously, she hasn't done that many kind of bad stuff.  But it doesn't really matter because this person is now the leader of the Labour Party.  Keir Starmer, the guy who came across as your centrist, moderate, reasonable, forensic.  No, no, these people are still the same.  It's still the same old Labour Party.  They don't care.  At least we have Priti Patel as Home Secretary who has decided to go against the senior judges and she wants to appeal their decision to try to stop Shamima from coming back to the UK.  because Well, whether we like it or not, the way the system works, the judges are separate to the executive and the government.  So we have a legal route.  Priti Patel can't randomly stop her.  She has to go through the legal route.  So she's going to do that.  It's going to be quite tough considering the way our judges are these days.  But that's our legal system, guys.  That's our legal system.  But we had Emma Webb actually making a speech about Shamima.  And she said something very interesting.  Let's watch this clip and come back. ",

She talks about how she is glad that she met her husband there because she wouldn't have found somebody like him back in the UK.  Thank God.  She had a good time, she said.  It fulfilled her aspirations.  It was what she expected. ",

            "text": "Well, Emma Webb is absolutely right.  She's spot on because firstly, Shamima is now 20 years old.  So she's now officially an adult.  She's been an adult for about two years.  So we have to treat her as an adult.  Stop treating her like a kid.  And she now knows what she did was wrong, obviously.  But she's, whether we like it or not, she is an enemy to this country.  And she doesn't regret what she did.  And the people who say, well, she was only a teenager at the time.  She was only 15, 16.  And we can't really trust a 15, 16-year-old for what they do or say.  Well, I present to you this other teenager, Greta Thunberg.  She was also, when she started her campaign, she was 15, 16.  I think to be fair with Greta, she's been 16 for the past four years.  I don't think she's aged.  But so when it comes to Greta, who is now, according to a lot of people in the United Nations, she's an expert in climate change and global warming.  She goes to conferences.  She's a spokesperson.  Because, you know, we have to listen to teenagers because they're very wise.  They know what they're doing.  They know what they're thinking.  We have to listen to them.  We have to give votes to 16 and 17 year olds.  But when it comes to this other one, no, she was only a child.  She didn't know what she was doing.  She was only a teenager.  Are you kidding me?  The hypocrisy is absolutely idiotic.  The double standards with the way people on the left treat teenagers is just completely wrong.  But we have to wait and see how things change in terms of Priti Patel.  But speaking of young people and how they're being treated, this is Miss Swimsuit UK.  I didn't even know we had Miss Swimsuit.  I just thought we had Miss UK.  But she is 23 years old.  And she decided to post on social media and say that what she said was very, very radical guys.  She said, all lives indeed do matter.  So they took away her title as Miss Swimsuit UK because she said, you know, all humans matter.  Yes.  So she's 23.  She's another young person.  And her opinion doesn't matter.  And, you know, her opinion is radical, that we should care about all humans, regardless of gender or race or any of that stuff.  So she has lost her title as Miss Tsum Tsum UK.  Again, it's brilliant.  I had no idea we had that.  But this is the hypocrisy of the left, the way they're dealing with the council culture and how, why can't we just cancel Shamima?  Seriously.  And Greta, for that matter.  But so yeah, this is an example of what they do.  But in other news, the other thing that came out today, speaking of idiots, is these guys, Public Health England.  Let's talk about these guys.  So this is an organization, a government body that was created by Jeremy Hunt in 2013.  And you know, as if we didn't have enough bureaucracy with the Department of Health and then the NHS, they decided to create this as well.  These guys have been responsible for testing, they've been responsible for the PPEs, they've been responsible for everything that's been happening, generally speaking, the direction of everything throughout the lockdown.  They failed.  And we said something a couple of months ago about the number of people who are losing their lives, who... of just being counted as they all had the same virus.  in fact it seems like they have admitted that a lot of people who did lose their lives didn't actually have it.  they just they were just registered as that.  yes they had the virus And now there's going to be an inquiry.  The government, Matt Hancock, is starting an inquiry, which means this review could hopefully result in Public Health England being abolished.  Because Boris Johnson has hinted that obviously these guys have been completely incompetent and completely bureaucratic.  And a lot of people have been saying that we don't actually need Public Health England anyway.  when you have the department and then you have the nhs so you've created three big governmental bodies and to be for all three of them terrible anyway.  but public health england is now um the new target because they have lied about the numbers of people losing their lives and the reason behind it.  We did hint, a lot of people have been saying this for a couple of months, that not everybody who's dying, that's the reason that they did.  So let's just see how this goes.  This is the inquiry that's going to be starting very soon.  And we'll keep you guys posted on this channel as usual.  But going back to this... the way the Left are and the Labour Party and Keir Starmer, because Keir Starmer has been quite ridiculous recently.  And his honeymoon period has also ended.  They're not doing too well in the polls.  He's virtuous signalling when it comes to ethnic minorities.  And this whole movement that's been going around with cultural Marxists is stupid.  And we have, we found this... um graphic which is quite actually quite accurate.  this is how labor does it?  by pretending to be the friend of the bame yeah i'm going to say bame because everyone says differently bame communities as we create for those who don't know that's just basically i think minorities or cultural bandwagon, we canvass their vote.  By keeping BAME communities divided from the rest of the electorate inside deprived housing areas, we control their votes.  By ensuring that BAME communities feel threatened and at risk, we can then manipulate their vote.  We are the Labour Party and we create racial tension and are the reason our societies are so divided by mistrust and hatred.  Obviously, this is not a direct quote, but Might as well be because that's exactly how the Labour Party treats ordinary people up and down this country.  And we need to expose them for who they are and what they do.  Thanks again for watching this channel.
