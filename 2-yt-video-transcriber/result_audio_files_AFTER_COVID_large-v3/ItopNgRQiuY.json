            "text": "Black Lives Matter is a joke.  You are the racist.  The racist is you.  It's because the white guy killed that.  You think they're racist?  The racist is the Black Lives Matter.  Go to Chicago.  They don't have schools.  And they die every day.  They don't matter.  Because you can't get attention from that.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Group of hypocrites.  Go to Southeast  D.C.,  Northeast, tell them black lives matter.  If it matters, it should matter everywhere.  You guys are hypocrites.  Attention seekers.  Attention seekers.  Black lives should matter everywhere.  It doesn't take a wake-up to kill a black person to matter.  So I'm here today because I heard about a demonstration on, you know, the George Floyd event, on the situation, which I'm going to be honest about it, it's wrong that, you know, anything like that should happen, okay?  It's very wrong.  My problem is there shouldn't be an opportunity for a group of people to use that as an excuse or to come across as victims.  No one is a victim here.  The only victim here is George Floyd.  Let's be very clear.  Everybody knows that black kills black more than anything.  You know that.  It doesn't take a white person to kill them for you to come out.  Hypocrites.  Just leave.  You leave.  I'm present.  You leave.  Make me leave.  I don't want to make you leave.  Make me leave.  Bunch of hypocrites.  Black lives matter only when a white person touches a black person.  Do you know how many black kids got killed in North D.C.  this morning?  What did she do?  You guys are the racist!  What did you do besides?  come out here and provoke shit?  No, go out there and tell the black people to go out there and help them!  Go tell the black person, black lives matter, then they will take you seriously!  Everybody thinks of this as a joke!  You're a joke.  Go out there and do it.  You're a joke.  What are you doing for the Chicago kids who are dying every day?  What you doing?  Do you go there and tell the black lives matter?  You going?  You going?  Make me go!  You going?  Make me go!  You're so supportive of them, go!  Make me go!  As an American citizen, I'm proud of this country.  I love this country.  I don't want my country to be portrayed like this.  We have a problem.  That, agree.  We have a problem in our country.  Agree.  Okay?  Too much violence.  But it should not be categorized as a symbolism for racism on blacks.  No.  We are in a free country.  Let me be very clear.  We have foreign news media here.  Our country is going to be portrayed the way they want our country to be portrayed, and which is not accurate.  My point was that black kids in Chicago get killed every single day.  Where is the black lives matter in Chicago?  Where are they?  When black people kill black people, they don't come out and do this crap.  The only time they do this crap is when a white person touches them.  They are the racist.  Yeah, they're racist.  Because white cops, it's wrong for a white cop to kill a black person, that's for sure.  But if it matters, it shouldn't matter at all times.  So what are you fighting for?  What are you fighting for?  You are not here to fight injustice.  You're here to cause drama.  A better message would be stop violence.  It's not about blacks.  In a unicorn world, that's not a unicorn world.  Stop the violence, period.  Okay, since you're so... Blacks are oppressed.  I am black, I'm not oppressed.  I am free.  That's for you.  That's an individual person.  What about a systemic issue?  Where?  I am black.  I've always wanted to be.  Like, I do what I want.  You have the skills.  This is a country where you have the skills.  You want to do what you want.  You do it.  Stop forcing on people to accept that they're oppressed.  They are not.  I am not oppressed.  I am black.  Stop making people accept that they're oppressed.  You're forcing a rhetoric into your mind, which is not true.  That's my point.  Violence is wrong, period.  It's not about blacks.  You agree that whites kill whites too, right?  Have you seen any white person coming out and saying white lives matter?  No, violence is wrong.  They literally do, all the time.  Every time there's a Black Lives Matter protest, a white person... It's a violence problem.  It's not a black problem.  It's a violence problem.  The blacks kill blacks in black neighborhoods every single day.  I have never seen a black lives matter in those neighborhoods.  Never.  Never.  Do you know what they say?  When a black person kills a black in a black neighborhood, they come out and they say, when the police come, do you know what they tell the police?  Stitches against stitches.  I know that.  Okay.  Snitches get stitches.  But if a white person kill a black person, black lives matter.  Stop the hypocrisy.  Nobody takes this seriously.  Nobody.  If it matters, it should matter in black neighborhoods.  You start cleaning at home.  So why don't you go?  Why don't you start?  You start your case at home.  Why don't you start?  I'm not carrying anything saying.  black lives matter.  I know I matter.  Why don't you start?  You guys are wasting everybody's time.  Okay?  Since you're so excited about this.  Black people are black more than any race.  Where's the black lives matter?  People.  I am free!  I am free!  I am free!  Bring it!  Bring it.  guys, bring it!  Bring it!  Bring it!  Why are you here?  Why are you here?  Why are you here?  Why are you here?  Why are you here?  Why are you here?  I am free, I'm in my country!  Why are you here?  I'm in my country!  Why are you here?  Okay, so if you don't believe in this cause, you're free to leave!  You're free, so you're free to leave!  I am free to stay too!  I am free to stay!  That's my house!  My house!  Black lives matter!  Black lives matter!  Do you know how many kids got killed and nothing you see this morning?  Let's hear the statistics.  Since you're such a stats expert and you can read stats off of me, tell me, what are the statistics?  What are the statistics of black people in jail?  What are the statistics?  Go.  What statistics do you have of black people dying in Chicago every day?  Where are you?  Bunch of hypocrites.  Bunch of hypocrites.  Don't waste anybody's time.  You know what?  You know what, guys?  No, I will tell you guys.  The world will take you guys seriously when you start your black lives movement.  When a black person kills a black person, you come out and say black lives matter.  There are community organizations that fight against that.  You have no idea.  Where?  Where?  Everyone.  Everyone.  Let's march.  Let's march.  Let's go!  Let's go!  Let's go!  Let's go to no peace!  Let's go to no peace!  Let's go to no peace!  I will go!  I will go!  I will respect your movement!  Do it in Chicago!  I respect you, Chicago!  You guys have been cowards!  You guys are not oppressed!  You're lazy, that's all it is!  Go get jobs!  Work! ",

            "text": "No.  What I think is that the mainstream media is helping propel this voice, which is very, very skewed from reality.  Okay, because the mainstream media can help them.  look at things from that perspective.  Why don't you start at home?  Bring the numbers to their attention.  Here are the numbers.  They don't lie.  African Americans kill each other more than anything.  These are numbers.  How about you start the change at home?  How about that?  Why does it take a white person to kill a black person for them to come out, oh my gosh, the end of the world?  How about that?  Why don't nobody bring that perspective to their face?  Is it ignorance?  What is it?  Is it deceit?  What are you trying to achieve?  This is common sense.  You want to change?  Start the change at home.  Common sense.  You don't need to be a nuclear physician to get this easy.  Start the change at home.  Period.  And let the mainstream media tell them the things the way they are.  Hey, yeah, we agree with you.  Violence is wrong in any way on any surface of the earth.  Violence is wrong.  But there's more violence in your own communities.  What do you do about that?  Are you going to come change violence at the White House?  Come on, give us a break.  The idea is to create a group of people who feel oppressed, okay?  Because the more they feel oppressed, the more they're going to look for some kind of equalization.  Nobody's oppressed in America.  Look, I'm a foreigner.  First of all, all Americans, we're all foreigners, okay?  If I'm hardworking, America's a country of... Why do you think the entire world wants to come to our country?  Okay?  Everybody wants to come to America.  And they want to pretend we're oppressed.  I am not oppressed.  I'm black.  I'm not oppressed.  I have a master's in health and administration.  Okay?  I'm going to be working for a federal agency.  I am not oppressed.  No black in America.  I don't feel oppressed.  I'll tell you that.  If you're driven, you're going to get accomplished what you want to accomplish.  We're in a country of the free.  Okay?  And let the mainstream media stop trying to force people to accept that they're oppressed.  I am not oppressed.  I am black.  I am not oppressed.  Trying to make some people feel oppressed is just to weaken them.  That's the bottom line.  You want to make this group of black people feel that they're wicked, that there's some power on top of them.  No one is oppressing nobody. ",
