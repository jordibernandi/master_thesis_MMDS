            "text": "Hello, I'm Carlton Pearson.  And this entire month of January 2020, many of us are going through a personal detox, whether that's a food, relationships, you know, people, habits, hobbies, even favorite things.  A toxic life is a poisonous life.  Sometimes we dig our graves with our forks.  And with the poisonous foods that we eat, that tastes so good.  And they're all creating problems and incidents in our life that feel uncomfortable.  But a lot of the problems can be solved just by removing some foods, by removing some people, by removing some habits or hobbies or even hungers.  from our lives.  And that takes discipline.  It takes focus.  It takes aim, vision, and ambition.  If you really care about your am-ness, then you'll make the necessary adjustments, which I'm encouraging you to do not only this month, but this year and ultimately all of your life.  It's a maintenance program that we all need to get in to stay healthy, to be happy, and to be whole.  You know I love you.  And of course, I believe in you too.  Peace. ",
