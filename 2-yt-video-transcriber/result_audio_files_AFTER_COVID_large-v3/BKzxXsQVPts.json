Residents in China's largest city facing fast-flowing floods and mudslides.  This as officials label the floods the lowest emergency level, warning it's just the beginning of flood season.  One of China's most unfortunate agricultural regions under attack by locusts, the insects decimating crops crucial to the region's survival.  A Beijing mall shut down after a confirmed virus case was found.  Now residents are wondering about the efficacy of the health tracing QR codes.  and a bipartisan bill sanctioning China now heading to the president's desk.  This in response to the national security law in Hong Kong.  CY analysts say it could strike a major blow to Beijing.  Welcome to China In Focus.  I'm Tiffany Meyer.  Now to China's floods.  In Chongqing City, upstream of the famous Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River, mudslides hit part of the city.  Since the beginning of June, floods have been battering southern and central China.  Seventy percent of China's provinces have suffered due to heavy rain, floodwaters or mudslides.  Chinese authorities announced on Thursday that the country has entered flood season.  The same day, the inflow of the Three Gorges Reservoir into the Yangtze River reached over 1.7 million cubic feet per second.  Chinese authorities called it the first of many big flood waves this year.  An emergency level 4 alert was activated the same day.  China's emergency response meter is divided into four levels according to the severity of the disaster.  Level 4 is the lowest, least dangerous warning.  Level 1 is the highest and indicates extraordinary danger.  That means right now, Chinese authorities say the country's flood situation is classed as the lowest level of emergency.  Forecasters are warning that from July 4th to the 6th, rainfall will increase in China's southwest region to the mid and downstream sections of the Yangtze River.  The area includes Wuhan and Shanghai.  The increased rainfall will pose a high risk of flooding both in the mountains and in the urban areas.  Now we turn to Beijing.  Inside a shopping mall, a customer was seen screaming and crying on Thursday after she received a phone call from a hospital informing her that she tested positive for the CCP virus.  She was sent to the hospital for treatment.  A restaurant owner there told us the whole shopping mall has been closed, including her restaurant.  Even takeout and delivery are suspended.  She said she didn't know if they'd be allowed to reopen the next day.  One netizen said since the woman's positive test results sent her into such extreme panic, it shows the epidemic has put the whole society under overwhelming pressure.  The shopping mall is located 10 miles from Tiananmen Square in the center of Beijing.  Now to the locusts.  Recently, we reported about locusts emerging in northern China and one province in central China.  Now, locusts emerge in the southern Chinese province of Guangxi, one of the most important agricultural provinces in China.  They are eating crops.  Chinese state-run media said 16 acres of farmland there has been hit by locusts.  But people from that area said the affected area is far more than 16 acres.  Maintaining investment and finance stability has become China's keynote.  Hundreds of Chinese trust investment victims are oppressed by authorities when trying to defend their rights.  Hundreds of investors gathered in front of the headquarters of Sichuan Trust Company, or STC, demanding that the company return their money.  The police later dispersed the crowd, detaining some.  Sichuan Trust Company broke its promise.  Its $3.6 billion project failed to pay its investors because of poor-quality underlying assets.  For several years, the company generated returns for early investors by bringing in new investors, like a Ponzi scheme.  But China's dire economic situation means this system is hard to keep up.  Voice of America reported that a Sichuan trust investor claimed the company's TOT project is engaged in illegal operations, like cooking the books, misusing funds and investment fraud.  China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission announced Beijing had issued an order suspending the TOT project.  In the middle of June, hundreds of investors protested outside as officials, investor representatives and the company staff held negotiations.  The protesters were finally dispersed by police.  There were more police and protesters at the scene.  The police blocked the view of passers-by with police vehicles and buses.  Mr.  Liu, a TOT investor from Beijing, told us some people were detained, among whom were two elderly people. ",

He says the authorities only want to eliminate the financial system's poor-quality underlying assets, but don't care about the billions of dollars investors are losing.  Reporting by Shi Wenhui, NTD News.  Thousands of Hong Kongers have taken to the streets to protest Beijing's national security law.  But it's not a sentiment held by everyone.  Behind closed doors, some investors are welcoming the inclusion by the mainland.  Analysts and traders say markets in Hong Kong will benefit from more Chinese company listings and more links to the world's second largest economy.  Chief executive at investment firm GeoSecurities, Francis Lunn, says there's a disconnect between the financial sector and the city's pro-democracy fighters.  He added Hong Kong's financial market will survive as long as Chinese companies come and enlist in Hong Kong.  Chinese companies already make up over 70 percent of Hong Kong's stock market.  Analysts say the city will financially benefit from closer ties to the mainland, which could soften the economic blow from Washington stripping Hong Kong of its special status.  But investors' view of the law could change if questions over Hong Kong's legal and political independence cause businesses to leave.  The city's economy would take a big hit in that case.  While the new law brings Hong Kong closer to the mainland, including bringing in Chinese money, it puts the city's international business relations in jeopardy.  Many Western countries are wary of doing business directly with China, preferring Hong Kong instead.  Hong Kong passed from British rule back to Chinese rule in 1997.  Under the one country, two systems framework, Hong Kongers were granted more freedom than people in mainland China.  The city also has separate legal and economic systems.  That policy was supposed to stay in place until at least 2047.  Critics have raised concern that the new law eradicates those differences, putting Hong Kong's place on the international stage at risk.  Many investors are staying silent about their views on the law.  Reuters said more than half a dozen people refused to talk about any effects the law could have on their businesses.  Some are already reviewing old posts on social media and deleting anything they think could be used against them.  Some managers have even advised employees that topics including the new law are to be kept off messaging apps or internet cafes.  And as Hong Kong comes under increased international scrutiny, China is increasing its scrutiny of foreign press inside the country.  Beijing has asked four U.S.  media outlets to disclose details of their staff and financial operations in China, as freedom of the press in the country appears to shrink even further.  That seems especially so for foreign media.  More than a dozen journalists have been expelled from the country in the past year.  Many of them are from the U.S China has said the expulsions are in response to moves by the U.S.  But critics say the Communist Party has used Washington's moves as a way to get rid of reporters who are covering sensitive topics like the internment camps in Xinjiang or the CCP virus outbreak in Wuhan.  The bipartisan bill sanctioning China has now been passed by both the House and Senate.  Analysts say by targeting the finance sector, the bill could strike a major blow to Beijing for its threats to Hong Kong's freedom.  Is there objection?  Without objection, so ordered. ",

Bloomberg reports that China's largest banks have over $1 trillion in dollar funding at stake and face potentially steep fines, according to the new bill.  And the sanctions target not only Chinese or Hong Kong banks, but any global banks whose customers include Chinese officials and their relatives.  U.S.  economist Peter Morici wrote that by sanctioning all foreign banks, the U.S.  would force some of the largest banks in Germany and France to make a choice, do business in New York or Shanghai.  Meanwhile, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told Fox Business that all companies who have Hong Kong as their headquarters for Asia are likely to begin to rethink whether that's still a good idea.
