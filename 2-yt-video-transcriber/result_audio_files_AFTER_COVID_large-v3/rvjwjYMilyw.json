            "text": "what's up everybody?  this is Dante Fortson here with episode 7 of go.  ask your pastor Israelites looked like Nubians.  yeah we're gonna get into some good stuff today but first today's study is brought to you by the world's worst researcher.  so after Nidhi and Nidhi never Nidhi made her made her for our almost for our response video for hours.  if you really count that 11 hour ranch you are 11 minute rant.  she went on before but after she made that response video.  if you watch the response video she tells people I'm attempting to hide information and I did not share the link to the Tel Aviv information because I didn't want people to see it.  and yet four days prior to her making that video all most of you who have watched this scene it sees has over 4,000 views when I took this screenshot.  this is not a today screenshot so it has more views than that now.  but those of you who watched it know I went over that information in detail and gave the links and pointed out why it's not credible to prove the Jews are white.  so now she's using it.  she's using that same source to prove the Jews are white and telling people that I did not share it because I didn't want them to see it.  she is literally the world's worst researcher to miss a 26 minute and 37 second video discussing the very thing she claims i was trying to hide.  and for those of you who know how go ask your pastor goes down.  i only cover one piece of evidence at a time.  so once again nephronity go check go ask your pastor.  episode three so you can update your response video.  people see that you're lying.  that's why you have so many thumbs down on it.  so anyway if you want to check out the world's worst researcher go to Nefertiti's channel.  you'll find lots of omitted and false information over there.  alright so go ask your pastor.  this is a segment on the channel where I attempt to get your pastor to cuss you out.  so if you ask your pastor these questions understand they may respond in a way you might not expect all right.  so let's talk about a short history of the cops and their church.  this is from London 1873 again London 1873. and just be aware that the urban apologists are big mad right now saying that we're we're taking history out of context or I'm taking history out of context because I keep showing evidence that says Israelites are black and it doesn't fit their narrative.  and so now they've had to update their narrative from no Jews in West Africa to white Jews West Africa.  they're saying Spain and Portugal deported all these white Jews to West Africa.  it's hilarious.  oh this is so good alright.  so let me read this know that the land of Egypt.  now I'm putting the link in the description because Nefertiti and the rest of the UA community have been lying saying I don't put links in the description.  but most of y'all know better than that.  y'all know I put links in the description every single time.  you don't have to tell me whether or not you believe me in order to get my.  in order to get my links from me i showed you guys that on the last episode neferditty telling people or asking people do they believe her or not before she shares her sources.  oh goodness man.  all right.  let me read this.  my eyes are watering again.  know that the land of egypt when the muslims this is that's um a word that means muslim.  when the Muslims entered it was full of Christians but divided among themselves in two sects both as to race and to religion.  this part is important.  they divided into two groups race and religion.  again race and religion.  the one part was made up of men about the court of public affairs all Greek from among the soldiers of Constantinople.  remember the Roman government broke in half.  you had Constantinople and he had Rome.  so now these are all Greeks from among.  so from among the soldiers of Constantinople the seat of government of rum or room.  now if you read above room is actually defined as Greek and Roman Greek plus Roman.  so again check out this resource for yourself.  read the whole thing.  I'm not trying to hide anything for it from you.  I'm not trying to cut off any pages so you don't see anything.  you don't have to hit me up and declare your loyalty to me.  before you see the link check it out.  read it for yourself.  so room refers to Romans and Greeks.  their views as well as their religion were for all of them melkite and we're gonna come back to that word melkite in the later study and their number was above 300 000. all greeks 100 greeks divided by race and religion.  now it's going to tell you the other the other divide.  the other portion was the whole people of egypt who were called kibbit or cops.  um up above right here you can see where it says the cops of egypt.  uh kibbit of miser.  qibt is a word that means copped copt or coptics.  if you've heard of the coptic bible um above again on the page if you go to the link and check it for yourself you will see that this person defines it as that.  that is not dante defining is that so?  the other portion was the whole people of egypt who were called kibbit and were of mixed descent among whom one could not distinguish copped from obsidian nubian or israelite.  they were all Jacobites.  some of them were writers in government offices others were merchants and tradesmen others were bishops and presbyters and such like.  others were tillers of the land in the country while others were a class of servants.  and it goes on.  now let's go back right here.  they could not tell the difference between Nubian or Israelite.  that's the part we're gonna focus on.  remember they were divided by race and religion.  so the Nubians and Israelites cops and obscenians were all Jacobites or all followed the religion of Jacob and they all had the same skin color all race all the same religion.  but let's continue.  because this mentioned Nubians looking like Israelites I decided to look up the word Nubian and I know that the urban apologetics community has a problem with Wikipedia even when you point out that you can click the little numbers.  this is for their researchers because they're trash researchers.  if you click the little numbers in Wikipedia it tells you what source things come from which means you can then go to that source and read it for yourself.  so when you say Wikipedia is unreliable you sound ridiculous especially when Nefertiti her only source in her first video was a random dude.  in Africa we don't have a name we don't have any credentials or anything.  they're fine with that.  I could put a random people with no credentials but if you check Wikipedia it's a problem.  oh my goodness these people are a joke.  so let's go over here to the dictionary Oxford Nubian relating to Nubia its people or their language native or inhabit of Nubia a Nilo-Saharan language of the Nubians.  that doesn't tell us much.  people asked what race of the Nubians this comes from Cura calm.  ancient Nubians were a heterogeneous group but they were still genetically and phenotypically identical to modern-day Sudanese pre-dynastic Nile Valley people who would have arrived who would have derived from the indigenous populations of Eastern Africa.  you know that you a community's gonna come in here arguing that all these people in Africa are white.  right because they're not good.  they don't want to hear nothing about black Israelites anything that's black.  these people try to turn it white but remember Nefertiti's pro-black.  she is pro-black but she argues against black people.  she don't want the Jews to be black.  she don't want nothing black around Israel.  she hates.  she hates black history.  she hates it.  she will defend those white people no matter what.  All right, so if we come over here to Wikipedia, their least favorite resource, Nubians are an ethno-linguistic group of people who are indigenous to the region, which is now present-day northern Sudan and southern Egypt.  They originate from the early sub-Saharan African inhabitants of the central Nile Valley, believed to be one of the earliest cradles of civilization.  Now, if you start talking to these people, mostly white Christians who don't believe in Israel and some anti-black people like Nefer Nitti and Vocab Malone and Damon Richardson and, you know, a lot of the UA community, They will tell you we're sub-Saharan African, right?  So if they're saying we're sub-Saharan African and the Nubians are descendants of sub-Saharan Africans.  would mean that the Nubians look like us.  we all know this common sense.  but anyway I had to go ahead and just click images on Google once I looked up Nubians.  you see I put Nubian and I just pulled up the images as they are and look at the people you can see what the people look like.  so when you go back and read that and it tells you you can't distinguish between Nubian and Israelite either the Nubians were dark like this like these people or they were white which is probably what the UA community is gonna try to prove now because every time they get disproven a flip-flop is one thing.  to change your position and just be honest about it it's another.  to go from teaching there were no Jews in West Africa and then almost immediately saying okay I admit there were Jews but they were white Jews with no research none whatsoever.  so if you think i'm misreading the evidence that says that you couldn't distinguish between israelites and nubians please go to the link in the description read it for yourself and point out how i'm misreading or misinterpreting or eisegeting history all this other nonsense that's going around that that the ua community is scrambling to say because they've been hit hard.  nothing to do about it.  but anyway make sure you go ask your pastor.  most importantly make sure you go share this on the UA pages.  every time they start talking about white Jews in Africa oh my goodness that's a ridiculous notion every time they start talking about white Jews in West Africa please share one of these videos just so the people on their pages can start to see that these people are liars.  oh my goodness man I feel good right now.  so I have a video coming just for you guys that are waiting to see if I'm gonna respond.  I do have another video coming.  I will be actually teaching but I will also be pointing out how much Nefertiti lied in her second response video.  I told y'all this woman is a false teacher.  I told y'all she's the world's worst researcher and again caught her in more false teaching more bad bad researching.  so make sure you hit the like button.  make sure you hit the subscribe button.  make sure you grab a copy of undeniable full-color evidence of Israelites in the Bible.  has all the pictures you want to see that confirm who we are.  make sure you check out the black Hebrew awakening the final 400 years of slaves in America.  and if you want the full detailed history.  and most of all if you're already subscribed make sure you click that notification bell and click all notifications so that you won't miss any future episodes.
