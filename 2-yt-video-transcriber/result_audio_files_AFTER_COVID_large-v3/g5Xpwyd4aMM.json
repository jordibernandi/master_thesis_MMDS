            "text": "Well, I want to talk to the Trump supporters for a minute.  What is Donald Trump's campaign about?  He's a race-baiting, xenophobic, religious bigot.  And you know how you make America great again?  Tell Donald Trump to go to hell.  If you can't admire Joe Biden as a person, then it's probably you've got a problem.  You need to do some self-evaluation.  Because what's not to like?  He is as good a man as God ever created.  He said some of the most incredibly heartfelt things that anybody could ever say to me.  He's the nicest person I think I've ever met in politics.  This is a defining moment in the future of the Republican Party.  We have to reject this demagoguery, and if we don't reject Donald Trump, we've lost the moral authority, in my view, to govern this great nation. ",
