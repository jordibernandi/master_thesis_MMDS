I don't know what episode this is from, but it seems to explain why it is that he has completely ghosted Dave Rubin and has not responded to any of Dave Rubin's requests to come on the podcast.  Go ahead and check this out. ",

As soon as you feel like someone's a grifter, you've got to cast them out.  You've got to cast them out because they've got to figure that out on their own and they've got to apologize.  That's cool, man.  Listen, you can be wrong.  But you have to be honest.  And if you're just bullshitting, then I can't hang out with you. ",

            "text": "So, I mean, if it wasn't already obvious that Joe Rogan ghosted and sort of ditched Dave Rubin, I think that this is a very clear video clip for you.  And I think it makes sense.  You know, I feel like Joe Rogan has on people and he's friends with people who are sort of all over the political spectrum, right wing, left wing, whatever.  He certainly has them on the podcast, right wing, left wing.  But I guess for him, he says that once you sense that somebody is a grifter or a fake, that's when you leave them alone.  So to him, sincerity is the biggest thing.  And I think that the biggest thing was probably his promotion of Candace Owens was probably the first step.  And then if you go back and watch that last podcast that Joe Rogan did with Dave Rubin, I mean... It was really a pretty big deal.  And I think it was the building codes argument that really set it off.  I think the whole building codes thing, I think it's really personal with Joe Rogan because he seems to be really passionate about it.  He spent a lot of his life with his dad who's an architect.  So I guess this is just an issue that's close to his heart is what it seems like to me.  And that's why it seems like he is just so passionate about that.  And I think he really took offense to that from Dave Rubin.  And he just didn't get the feel that he was being legitimate and that he was being a fraud.  So it seems like it takes him a while to sniff out these grifters.  I think some people who are on the chopping block for that, I think one of those is Tim Pool, for example.  I think he's definitely somebody who's probably on the chopping block.  I think he's going to be uh you know one of the people who is going to be sniffed out next.  it seems to take a while for him.  you know for example also uh this wasn't someone who he thought it was a grifter.  i think.  i think he just didn't like his ideas but stefan molyneux he had on one time and then he brought him on again and challenged him on all the crazy shit that he believes in like defooling.  Joe Rogan seems to have completely ditched Dave Rubin altogether and I don't think that Dave Dave Rubin honestly has been ditched by basically everyone and that's why you see him appearing on these really random podcasts that we've never heard of before.  Because instead of being on Joe Rogan's podcast and this kind of stuff, and being on intellectual dark web podcasts with Sam Harris or whatever, he has to resort to going on these random tiny podcasts.  I think the intellectual dark web has completely ditched him.  The Weinstein brothers definitely seem like they have ditched him.  They disavowed him and disagreed with what he was doing and the direction that he was taking the intellectual dark web in.  Um, Sam Harris seems to have completely ditched him a long time ago.  Sam Harris is a very anti-Trump guy, largely for not the best reasons, but nonetheless still an anti-Trump guy.  Uh, he didn't like how, he had thrown some subtle shots at Dave Rubin and Jordan Peterson years ago.  around when the intellectual dark web was first founded by saying that they're dishonest for not calling out Donald Trump for being a liar and all that stuff.  So Sam Harris had distanced himself from Dave Rubin a long time ago.  Joe Rogan seems to have just kind of jumped on the train.  Ben Shapiro I think is the last one standing but even him I don't think really has a close connection with Dave Rubin anymore.  Certainly not like he did before.  Honestly I think a lot of that probably just has to do with the utility of Dave Rubin's grift being so low now.  Like, I feel like nobody really cares about Dave anymore, but before he was kind of on the new block of him, this former liberal who's also gay and on TYT.  Now I'm a conservative, and so they used the shit out of him, basically, as Dennis Prager told him to his face.  I think Sam Harris distanced, I know Sam Harris distanced himself, I know the Weinstein brothers have distanced himself from Dave Rubin, and Joe Rogan has now joined the trail as well.  He's joined the train as well.  I think the last man standing is just Ben Shapiro at this point.  And the only reason I even say that is because I saw that he went on his podcast on Dave Rubin's show.  Sorry, if he had not done that, I would have suspected that he had distanced himself from him as well, because there don't appear to be any clear.  Sort of interactions between the two.  Dave Rubin used to at Ben Shapiro and arguments a lot to try to get him into arguments.  They just don't seem to be that strong anymore.  So Dave Rubin's Career, I think is gonna take a pretty large downturn because a lot of the guests who were the gravy trains Jordan Peterson Dave Rubin Joe Rogan those people are all out of the scene.  Jordan Peterson apparently is barely alive and I don't even know if he's still alive.  And then these guys all dip from him.  Dave Rubin is in trouble, man.  He's in trouble. ",
