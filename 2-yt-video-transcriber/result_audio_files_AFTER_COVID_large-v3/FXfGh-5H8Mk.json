            "text": "Ted Cruz, referencing this article from Town Hall, Why Trump Doesn't Just Send in the Troops from Kurt Schlichter, endorses the idea, quote, the feds should focus on the LARPing middle class SJWs and the dedicated Marxist cadre and use RICO, conspiracy and other federal charges to take them out and lock them up.  Well, take them out might be a little strong because, you know, they're going to get offended and be like, oh, no, they're threatening.  You take them down, you know, arrest them.  Just be more specific.  So this is actually pretty awesome that I see, you know, Ted Cruz endorsing this.  He's also talked about the 1619 Project.  So way to go, Ted.  I don't know if I necessarily agree, because I don't know enough about RICO and conspiracy.  But if the feds can stop these people and arrest them, then I say do it.  And that's why I've been praising Trump for having the feds deputize state police in Oregon, because there you go.  Now all these charges will be federal level.  But you got to understand, A lot of these people in these key cities are coordinating these things and traveling across state lines, particularly between Portland and Seattle.  In that case, you got federal charges coming, baby.  But Ted Cruz brings up another quote.  When little Ashley from the suburbs realizes that she's looking at five years in federal prison instead of heading back to Evergreen State to finish her Bolivian 13th century trans dance degree, the lawyer daddy buys her, will get her to sing like a canary about her commie pals.  Well, there's a reason I bring it up because it's a real story.  It's not literally identical, but it is like in spirit.  Wealthy NYC college student 20 is among eight arrested for causing 100 grand worth of damage to businesses in Manhattan during BLM rampage.  Clara Kraber, 20, a wealthy college student.  Oh, you love to see it, don't you?  Well, she's going to get locked up.  Now, I think she'll get some kind of slap on the wrist because she comes from a wealthy family and you got money, you got power.  They're going to hire a good lawyer and then we'll see how this plays out.  But I say lock her up.  I don't think she should go to prison for four years.  I think they're saying she's facing like four years in prison.  I think that's a little bit much for these dumb kids.  But hey, man, they need some time to learn, you know, what did it like to look?  They need some time for rehabilitation because they're clearly unhinged.  That's what.  that's the best way to put it.  They say a wealthy college student is among the eight people arrested on rioting charges after participants in a Black Lives Matter protest went on a rampage.  Clara Kraber, 20, was among those arrested after the vandalism spree on Friday in the Flatiron District, where demonstrators were protesting the death of Daniel Prude.  All were charged with rioting, and some were additionally charged with weapons and burglary tool possession.  Kraber declined to comment on the charges to the New York Post when reached by phone at her family's second home in Connecticut, saying, no, not right now.  I don't want to talk about it at her family's second home.  Tear down the system.  Capitalism is bad, she yells from her vacation property in Connecticut.  Get out of here, man.  These people, I tell you what, revolutionary abolitionist movement protesters geared up in Black Block to take over NYC streets, carrying death to America and free all prisoners banners.  My friend, do you know who the first target will be when the justice system collapses?  You.  You're a rich person.  They hate you.  They will go to your house.  They will take your things.  And you don't even want to know what happens next.  Of the eight arrested, five were men and two were women.  Two of the arrests are from out of state, including one from Portland, Oregon.  Portland, Oregon.  You see, it all comes full circle.  This is why, you know, look, this is why I highlight what I did.  Ted Cruz, conspiracy, Rico, all that stuff.  Yes.  Ted, I don't know what you can do as a senator from Texas, but maybe you can do something.  I don't know.  Trump should do something, though, because people from Portland are coming to New York and inciting violence.  And now this this this dumb woman, she's going to go to prison.  I mean, I don't know if she'll actually go to prison because the D.A.  is cutting everybody loose.  You Her father is a psychiatrist who teaches at Columbia University of Psychiatry, and her mother is an architect at a prestigious Manhattan firm.  The family in 2016 purchased a $1.8 million apartment on the Upper East Side and also owns a home with four fireplaces in Connecticut.  Well, bravo to her family.  I wonder how her rich parents feel about their daughter.  How would they feel if they graffitied their townhouse, one law enforcement source told the Post.  This girl should be the poster child for white privilege, growing up on the Upper East Side in another home in Connecticut.  This is the height of hypocrisy.  You know what?  I tell you this, I know a decent amount of far left progressive individuals, females, pro Antifa, violent rioters, and they're rich.  I know probably like three or four.  And I think it's kind of hilarious.  They don't understand hard work.  They've had everything handed to them.  So all of this makes sense.  They're sitting there in their loft up on, I don't know, Upper East Side, Upper West Side.  It's a very expensive area.  All the celebrities are living there and they're thinking to themselves, I've always gotten whatever I wanted.  Why can't we just do that for everyone?  Not realizing you're a rich dude.  You know, my favorite thing about these people, because I mean it when I say I know some of these people.  not her specifically, but I know these wealthy Upper East Side New Yorkers, these young women.  And it's like, I tell them as I'm sitting atop the 70th floor of the Trump Tower or whatever, I don't know how many floors it has, 50th floor.  And I'm like, we're talking about this stuff and talking about these lefty things.  And I laugh and I would say something like, dude, you're rich.  Like, why are you acting like?  you know anything about the working class struggle?  And they'd be like, dude, I am not rich.  You do not understand.  And I'm like, we're on the 50th floor of the Trump building.  Look across the street.  That's the UN.  What do you mean?  you're not rich?  Well, my parents are rich.  And you live in this building with like door people and celebrities.  And you have money in your bank account that you did not work for.  Well, it's not like I can buy a yacht or something.  No, but you have a luxury car.  Here's the thing.  Listen.  These young people think because I can't buy a mega yacht, I'm not really rich.  I just get $10,000 a month from daddy put into my expense account so I can buy the shoes that I need.  But the shoes are normal.  I'm only making 120 from my dad and doing no work.  But middle class median in New York City is 140,000.  Therefore, I'm actually poor.  I'm not kidding.  You think I'm exaggerating.  They actually believe a lot of these things.  My parents pay my rent for my Williamsburg apartment and I have keys to my fancy loft overlooking the UN building, but I'm broke.  No, you're not.  It's like, dude, they order out every day.  They get whatever they want.  This is not surprising to me at all.  I bet she thinks she's poor.  She'll say something like, well, my parents are like exploiting the working class, so I'm broke.  No, you're not, dude.  You live in the Upper East Side and you have a house in Connecticut.  Well, I don't know.  I'm not going to put it on her.  I don't know what she believes, but I think the story is hilarious.  Well, I'll tell you what.  where do you live?  Connecticut or New York?  Because if you live in Connecticut and that's your official address, well, you cross state lines to commit a crime.  Friday's demonstration was organized by groups calling themselves the New African Black Panther Party and the Revolutionary Abolitionist Movement.  Police say that demonstrators started out at Foley Square, where they lit trash cans on fire and scrawled graffiti, including the word abolition.  You know, I don't want to get too brutal, man.  I've been to some of these countries where you got no police.  Let me just tell you about what life would be like for someone like her.  You know.  The world is not safe.  And the world is particularly not safe for young, white, wealthy females who venture off into faraway lands with no security and no police.  And we see this all the time.  Now, there is a decent argument, I would say, in the dangers of world without security and police.  There was a story about some women who went hiking in Morocco.  well, they lost their lives, to put it bluntly or mildly, to say the least.  When I've done this hostile environment training stuff, when I've consulted with security experts, they typically tell you, men, well, you just die because that's what's what used to you have.  You're in the way.  They'll take your stuff.  Women, on the other hand, women get to live as property when there's no police and nothing to stop this.  And you go to these countries in certain areas of the Middle East, North Africa.  if you become property.  So there are questions about what is worse, being enslaved or being killed.  I don't know.  I think that's going to, some people would rather, you know, die on their feet than live on their knees.  Some people would probably just struggle to, would prefer to survive even if it meant they were captured and used by men in these places.  I know, maybe I'm getting a. This young woman would not want, she does not understand what she's advocating for when she calls for abolition.  They're calling for abolition of police, mind you.  She doesn't get it.  The people are going to ransack her homes and burn them to the ground.  They're going to take everything she has and then she'll, bad things will happen.  I'll just put it that way.  Bad things will happen.  We live in a bubble.  And I've said it before, but a lot of the progressive policies we have only exist because we've secured our space and we are safe.  And that's a good thing.  But these people are going too far, smashing and destroying things, taking away that security.  People are going to call for a harsher, it's going to result in a right-wing surge.  And it probably already is.  And they will not like living in that country.  You know, I think it's silly.  They always mention the handmaid's tale as if that's what would happen.  No, it wouldn't be like that.  But it would curtail a lot of their freedoms and their rights.  if civil order breaks down.  Women's rights will be set back.  Rights for so many groups will be set back.  And they're doing everything in their power to make sure that happens.  The more violent they get, the more people will call for a right wing government and a police state and authoritarianism.  I guess it's a lesson she probably won't ever learn because I don't think we're heading.  I don't think it'll get that dark, but maybe we'll see what happens.  We will see.  And then maybe they'll truly understand.  But for the time being, she's facing prison, I believe four years, they say.  So maybe she'll get a dose of reality when she spends some time in the slammer.  I got one more segment coming up for you in a few minutes.  Stick around and I will see you all shortly. ",
