And I talked to more than a dozen different lawyers, very high ranking former officials from the Department of Justice, the Federal Election Commission, and other government entities.  And if there was a consensus to be had, it was around this notion that Donald Trump is going to be dealing with this stuff for a long, long time to come, particularly if he doesn't have the protection of the presidency.  That may be regarding his campaign, it may be regarding the Trump organization and his business entanglements.  And it also might be involving Trump's taxes.  It could be involving other things, including the Hatch Act.  There's more than a half a dozen things that got named in the story by the folks that we interviewed who see this as a real problem. ",

And one thing I didn't mention but will now is the Mueller report.  The Mueller report, everyone might have forgotten about that, that's old news, dealing with impeachment, that seems like a lifetime ago.  But the fact of the matter is that the Mueller report laid out some potential crimes, if you believe that they are, that Donald Trump had committed, particularly around obstructing government justice.  And if you believe that that's an issue, and many in the legal field do, that's something that could be prosecuted after Donald Trump is president, and really only after Donald Trump was president.  So that's something that, hey, if there is a Biden administration to be had, if Joe Biden becomes president of the United States, That would be an option to go forward, not saying that it will in any way, shape or form happen.  But put that in the soup too, that could be a troubling issue for Donald Trump in 2021. ",

My inclination would be to say that Joe Biden is probably not gonna be leading chance to lock him up or anything like that.  It's not to say that the Justice Department won't be investigating, but what I'm curious about is, How much of this is dependent on Joe Biden's stance and how much of it is independent of him?  Obviously, if the Southern District of New York is continuing investigations, it doesn't really seem to matter what Joe Biden says.  But the Justice Department, would there be independent investigations of Donald Trump?  if Joe Biden isn't particularly interested?  How much influence does he have? ",

He's not going to wave the magic Joe Biden wand and say, we're going after Donald Trump and we're gonna politicize the DOJ.  And we're gonna do everything that we can to have some sort of truth and reconciliation commission here.  That probably isn't going to happen, but it may not necessarily, as you suggested, be up to Joe Biden, were Joe Biden to become president.  Also too, there's state level matters in New York State that are really dogging the Trump Organization.  That also could be a problem, and that's not a federal level matter at all.  So Donald Trump would have to deal with that.  New York State.  The point is, is that Donald Trump is going to have to be dealing with lots and lots of different things from all different sides.  And Joe Biden is not going to be the one orchestrating all of this.  It is going to, to a very strong degree, John, come from different angles, different agencies, different elements of the government.  And it might be on very different timetables from one investigation to another. ",

I mean, obviously, there were a lot of people that were very worried about the chance of lock her up and all of that.  This idea that, prospectively, we don't even know what for, but there's gotta be some sort of investigation of his political opponents.  If Donald Trump leaves office, if either the Justice Department or New York or some other investigation were to lead to him actually being charged.  I wonder what the reaction of his followers would be if they would consider this to be illegitimate on its face, that he would become a legal martyr.  From what you've seen of Trump's base, do you expect some sort of reaction like that?  Regardless of whether this is about taxes or Hatch Act or inauguration or election, you break down so well in this article, all of the different avenues of investigation.  It seems hard to imagine his base accepting the charges from any of these areas. ",

If Donald Trump was to lose and lose decisively, then people may be moving on from Donald Trump perhaps a little bit more quickly than they would if this is a contested election.  If we're dealing with legal challenges in Florida and Wisconsin and Pennsylvania and who the heck knows where else.  So that can definitely, if you read your history, at least some factor in all of this.  So I think although it remains to be seen, yeah, not everyone is going to just simply up and abandon Donald Trump regardless of what happens during the election. ",
