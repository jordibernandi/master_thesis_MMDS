            "text": "So in the normal course of my day, doing my thing, looking for news, I get a text message and it's from somebody who's pretty famous.  And I look at it and they're like, yo, this guy made a video for you.  And I was like, oh, that's cool.  It's called Message to Tim Pool.  And I was like, oh, that's cool.  It's cool.  I got it back to work, though.  So, you know, I'll check it out when I can.  I get another text message, this time from another person who's also pretty famous.  And they're like, man, this guy's message to you.  It's amazing.  And I look at it.  I'm like, wow.  I was like, man, this guy's getting a lot of traction.  It's like, I got to work, though.  Then my Facebook lights up.  I get people tweeting at me.  And I'm like, all right, I'm going to stop what I'm doing.  I'm going to watch this video.  And it's a video from a guy named Gary Lamb.  You guys stick around for this one.  This is an awesome story.  First of all, Gary.  Thank you so much for the video.  Let me just say, it's kind of crazy to me.  So many people watch me.  I'm sitting in this room staring at a camera.  I just talk about my feelings.  That's really what I do.  I mean, I believe in trying to best understand what's going on.  That's what I do.  And from my research, trying to make sure I have the facts correct, I form an opinion.  And then I just talk about how I feel.  I've likened what I do kind of to like a kind of therapy almost where it's like I get to express my feelings on the world and give my reason for doing it.  There are a lot of people that don't like me for doing it.  Because I'm like a middle of the road dude with like some left wing opinions on a bunch of traditional wedge issues.  But I've been I've been growing disillusioned by the Democrats because instead of offering me up the real issues, they keep playing the same game, attacking Donald Trump.  And Trump is not that bad.  In fact, he's done a lot of really good things earlier on.  in Trump's presidency, there were a lot of things I didn't like because foreign policy is, you guys know me, I complain about foreign policy all the time.  So this message is not just for Gary Lamb, but it's also for Donald Trump.  You see, what ended up happening with this video is that it started getting a ton of traction.  As of right now, it's got 265,480 views.  This video isn't just about me.  Gary Lamb.  in this video, he says thank you to me, I guess because he watches my videos and I unlocked him.  I showed him maybe a message counter to the mainstream media.  But something really nuts happened.  The madman has done it.  Donald Trump has pinned a portion of the video to his Twitter page saying to Gary, thank you.  I will never let you down.  Gary, you are the American dream, man.  No joke.  So am I. And there are a lot of people who find it every single day.  Is Donald Trump the American dream?  Well, some people on the left would argue he's not.  Some will argue he is.  I don't think just because Trump was born to a wealthy family doesn't mean he can't find his own American dream.  The dude was born wealthy.  I can respect that.  He had advantages many of us didn't have.  But he turned a million dollar loan from his dad into a billion dollar net worth, eventually becoming the president.  The dude has certainly been able to accomplish his goals.  The fact of the matter is the American dream is about making it for what?  for yourself.  You might not become president.  You might be born rich, but are you going to make something of yourself?  Are you going to improve yourself?  If Donald Trump just stayed where he was and was the son of a rich family and just lived in luxury, he could have done that his whole life.  Instead, he built an empire and then became president.  And after becoming president, he's actually seen his net worth go down.  I think that shows there was a sacrifice on his part.  I think Donald Trump really does care about about this country.  And I think it's fair to say, man, there are absolutely things you got to criticize the guy over.  I'm not here to play games and prop up anybody's tribe.  I'm not here to put on a MAGA beanie and wave a sign and just tell you what you want to hear.  I just talk about my feelings.  That's really what it is.  Gary, You did the same thing.  You made a video and you just told your story.  You spoke your truth as you see it.  You explained your feelings and the president noticed because this is how things work when you work hard.  Let me tell you guys something, which you got to realize.  Many people may not know this.  You may have seen these videos from from Gary Lamb.  You may have seen this video from Gary Lamb.  You may have seen the president himself post this video.  But did you know that Gary's been working hard for a really, really long time?  There's not such a thing as an overnight success for the most part.  Gary's been producing videos forever.  Here's a dude who's been working at it, telling his story, expressing his feelings.  I don't think it's necessarily about me.  Look, a lot of people are hitting me up.  I'm getting messages from people saying that, look what you're doing, Tim.  Look who you're in front.  No, no, no, dude, dude, dude, dude.  I turn this camera on and I just talk about my feelings.  Some people agree with me, I guess.  Some people disagree.  But I guess people respect it enough to want to watch it.  Maybe it's because I do a good job.  They think so.  I don't know.  Sometimes I get things wrong.  I just pull up stories.  I read them.  I talk about what I think is important.  And I try and work hard every single day.  I try to do the best that I can and do the most that I can.  And it's kind of getting a bit crazy.  Working too much, 16 hour days trying to make this thing work.  But what you got to realize about this video from Gary and getting the shout out from the president, Gary put up a new video a couple hours ago saying what is happening with him and his wife smiling and laughing.  That's awesome, dude.  Let me let me let me show you.  What we see here is the American dream in action.  And this is and that's why this is for Donald Trump.  to Donald Trump.  You put out this video from a guy who's been working hard at it for a long time.  All of these videos that he's been making over the past couple of years.  This is not some dude who just one day made a random video, got blasted out by the president.  And that was it.  An overnight success.  This is a dude who's been sharing his feelings.  Look at this.  Gary Lamb's got a video on the Netflix story.  He's got a video time to get some momentum.  Not afraid.  Amazon back to work.  He's got videos about polyamory.  He's got a ton of videos.  This is a guy who's been putting up videos, even though look at this.  One video only got 66 views.  One video only got 88 views.  One video only got 74 views.  Did he stop?  No.  He said, I'm going to keep going, dude.  I checked out your channel.  It is awesome.  And this is what I keep telling everybody.  You know what gets me down sometimes?  I've had a ton of people say, I want to do what you do.  You know, before I did all this YouTube stuff, before I was just explaining my feelings and doing research and sharing stories in these videos, I was traveling the world.  And I've been to dozens, like, you know, several dozen countries.  More than several dozen.  And I've been in conflict and crisis.  I got to experience history firsthand around the world.  Eventually, it started to get more and more difficult because people started to notice me.  They started to recognize me.  And then when my safety became an issue, I adapted and I started doing things like this.  I had a lot of people ask me, what can I do?  I want to do what you do.  I want to get a big YouTube channel.  And I said, start doing it.  Start doing it now.  No one's going to hand this to you.  The people who go out there and say they're going to give you things, they're going to give you, I'm going to give you this.  You deserve this.  This is your right.  No, no, no, no, no.  We have rights.  We have negative rights.  Like, I can speak.  I can defend myself.  I can freely move around.  Positive rights, however, that's a little bit more difficult.  That's a reference to saying, like, I am owed something.  Now, I do believe that we as a developed, civilized society can have social programs that work so long as we're careful and we're willing to accept when they go wrong and we take them down.  We can't just say we're going to keep giving people fish.  No, we got to teach people to fish.  And that's what I believe.  And so I lean a little bit left on those issues.  But the key is working hard, getting started.  And you know what I hear from these people?  This is my complaint.  They say, oh, you're you're fortunate.  You're privileged.  You have money, Tim.  That's not true.  My success right now is because I was rolling that snowball down the hill and I started with nothing.  I got started doing all of this stuff, sleeping in the park in New York City during Occupy Wall Street.  I had I had a couple hundred bucks and I took a bus ticket down to New York City and I slept in that part and I hung out and it was fun and I was driven to do it.  And day by day, I was putting up new videos.  I was working hard.  It turned into a career.  And here I am, not an overnight success, a decade in the making.  That's the American dream.  That someone like Gary has made videos all the time.  Look at this.  A week ago, two weeks ago, a month ago, he's been putting in the hours even when he couldn't necessarily even see the light at the end of the tunnel.  He was driven.  He was passionate.  You can be just like Gary and you can be just like me because the only thing that we have that maybe you're missing is that we just started doing it.  Check it out.  So Gary eventually hit that sweet spot.  He made a video, a message to Tim Pool, and a lot of people were saying it's about me.  It's not.  It's not.  It's about Gary and it's about Donald Trump.  Look, I'm a guy who's sitting here talking about his feelings and maybe that helped.  But what we really have here is this guy, Gary, worked really, really hard to figure out his life and solve his problems.  And that message about how he solved his problems and how he respects and appreciates Donald Trump translated into people.  They saw that message.  It resonated with them.  It wasn't some dude who just one day made that video.  And then everyone said, wow, look at this guy.  He's great.  No, no, no.  He's been working hard every single day.  And eventually one of those one of those lottery tickets was the right lottery ticket.  That's it.  Chance favors the prepared.  That's the saying.  If you work hard all day, every day, you start getting more and more views.  Look at even the video before this one got 1100 views.  His video after this gets 13000.  It'll go down a little bit.  You know, you got to make sure that you just keep doing your thing and you do it better and better every day.  So now we have this dude, Gary, in his truck explaining his job, what he does and how he sees Donald Trump as as as a path, a way out.  Of course, the left is coming after him.  What does that even mean?  What is what has Trump even done for you?  Trump got black unemployment way down.  And here is a black working class man saying he respects and appreciates Donald Trump as someone who helped him.  Here's a guy saying that for 47 years, Joe Biden did nothing for him.  So I'll tell you, first and foremost, respect the perspective, the feelings that people might have.  Under Trump, everything got really good.  Before that, things were rough for this man.  That doesn't mean it's a universal truth, and it doesn't even mean Trump did it.  But I think we give Trump\u2014Trump deserves respect for his victories in economics.  The economy was improved the best numbers of our lives.  What Trump said he would set out to do, it worked and it worked for a lot of Americans.  And it's that simple.  Now you can talk about a lot of things.  Trump has done bad, but people in this country view Trump favorably on the economy.  And if you ignore that and you ignore the story of Gary Lamb, you will lose in November.  So let me just, I try to keep these segments short.  Gary, thank you so much.  This is awesome.  Isn't this like the coolest thing ever?  I was just, you know, I saw the video.  I commented on it.  I said, bro, you're the American dream because this is a guy who's been working hard all the time.  And now he's getting attention for his hard work.  He's making it happen.  And the president notices you.  Now, come on, we get it.  You said good words about the president.  He liked what you got to say.  He's going to blast you out.  Not everybody, though.  So here you go, man.  That's it.  It's the coolest thing ever to have some dude making his YouTube videos, say thank you to me.  I respect that.  I'm humbled by this.  I'm just telling my story the same as you're telling yours.  And then the president takes notice.  And now here we are in this cool, very personal back and forth, something that wasn't possible a decade ago, two decades ago, to have the president of the United States put out your message, man, Now, in that message, it was just the portion where you're talking about Trump.  I'm kind of glad he doesn't say my name because I just like sitting here telling my story and doing my thing.  And I think, you know, that's what we should all do.  Just work hard and and do what we can.  But don't ever don't ever.  let them tell you you can't make it.  Don't ever let them tell you.  They say you'll never succeed because of your gender, because of your race, because of your age.  No way, dude.  Rodney Dangerfield was like 50 when he became famous.  He never gave up.  Gary Lamb, they'll probably tell you you're oppressed, you're marginalized.  You work hard.  The president will shout you out.  The same is true for me.  Mixed race high school dropout from the south side of Chicago.  You work hard.  You can make it.  You can make it.  You may not become a millionaire.  You may not become president, but you can succeed.  The American dream is real.  It never left.  They're just trying to convince you you can't do it.  Don't let them get you down.  Every day you wake up, decide.  What are you going to do today to be a little bit better than you were yesterday?  And when those people try to try to drag you down, crabs in a barrel, they call, they see you climbing out, they pull you back.  Don't let them do it.  Tell them, no, I know what I need to do.  I'm going to figure it out and I'm going to find that solution.  And you can be just like any anyone who's made it.  Guys, thank you all so much.  This has been a blast.  I got a couple more segments coming up in a few minutes, and I will see you all shortly.  Thank you. ",
