Bethel and Bill Johnson's teachings are dangerous, and somebody complained that there was no actual footage proving what I said.  So today we're going to look at 12 false teachings of people in Bethel, and I'll provide footage and references as well.  Number one, Jesus was born again.  You can hear Bill Johnson say it right here. ",

Hebrews 1, it says this, For to which of the angels did he ever say, You are my son, today I have begotten you?  In Acts 13, he explains that.  God has fulfilled this for us, their children, and that he has raised up Jesus, as it is also written in the second psalm, You are my son, today I have begotten you.  And that he raised him from the dead, no more to return to corruption.  He was born through Mary the first time, and through the resurrection the second time.  He was born again. ",

            "text": "Jesus was not born again because he did not need to be born again.  He did not have a sinful nature, and though he was tempted, he did not sin against God.  He wasn't dead in sin, so he didn't need to be made alive.  Number two, kenosis, and that Jesus set aside his divinity while on earth.  According to this doctrine, Jesus was no longer divine from his birth to his ascension.  Bill Johnson has promoted this heresy in Face to Face with God on page 108.  He said, Jesus set aside his divinity, choosing instead to live as a man completely dependent on God.  He also restated this in chapter 7 of When Heaven Invades Earth, saying, Jesus laid his divinity aside as he sought to fulfill the assignment given to him by the Father.  i've said it before and i'll say it again jesus is always god and always has been god and if jesus was not divine when he died on the cross then he would not have been a sufficient sacrifice.  i could go on to many verses but i'll give just one john one one two three.  in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god.  he was in the beginning with god.  all things were made through him and without him nothing that was made was made And actually 1.14, and the word became flesh and dwelt among us.  Number three, dominionism.  And this is the teaching that ahead of Jesus' return, the church will become all powerful on earth and make it ready for the Lord.  This is so wrong because there is absolutely no biblical proof for this except a man-made twisting of God giving Adam dominion and we're supposed to take it back.  now this goes hand in hand with the teachings like seven mountain mandate which is the idea that christians are supposed to take over the seven mountains of culture in order to transform the world and the concept of bringing heaven to earth reclaiming society and creation for the kingdom.  the bible does not say that the world will get better and christians will dominate before jesus return.  it says that we'll be persecuted as christians face tribulation and the world will get worse and worse.  The Bible says that evil men and impostors will go from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived.  And in Matthew 24, Jesus clearly tells us that wars, famine, earthquakes, and evil doing will increase like birth pains.  That doesn't sound like a Christian domination to me.  Number four is the prosperity gospel.  They teach that health, wealth, and prosperity are promises of salvation or obedience.  In a 2013 article entitled, Courage to Leave a Legacy, Bill Johnson wrote, Our connection with God is obviously the source of all blessing, prosperity, and goodness in our lives.  We make our way prosperous through obedience because when we do what He asks us to do, we strengthen our connection with the source of life.  Now we know this isn't true just by looking at people like John in the Bible who lived in the desert, wore camel hair for clothing, ate locusts and honey, and had his head cut off for his obedience.  Of course, God can prosper anybody he wants to in any way he wants to, but that is not a guarantee for everybody who is a Christian.  And these prosperity pimps have the audacity to go to poor countries and preach this false hope and promise.  Number five, it's always God's will to heal.  In his article, is it always God's will to heal someone?  He claims Jesus is perfect theology. ",

            "text": "now for the most part i do believe god is much more in support of healing than against it.  yet not everyone is healed.  why only god truly knows?  but just think about the amazing body he's designed for us.  he's made it to heal itself when we get hurt or get sick.  truly amazing.  but to teach that it's always god's will to heal everybody is just not biblical.  Number six, they teach that you can learn spiritual gifts.  Like many in the Charismatic Movement, there are schools everywhere now teaching prophecy, healing, and everything under the sun.  But we know a gift is a gift and that God distributes these as He chooses.  The Bethel School of Supernatural Ministry says that what makes the academic instruction at BSSM unique is that it is taught by apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers.  The school says students will learn how to read, understand, and do the Bible, how to practice His presence and witness, heal the sick, prophesy, preach, pray, cast out demons, and much more.  once again there's not one verse in the bible that says we can learn any of these things.  this is man-made nonsense in the name of money.  number seven our words have supernatural power.  this is a typical word of faith heresy that some even take.  to the extent that we can speak things into existence that because christ is in us we can create things with our words In the next short clip, he's just using it for healing and commanding it.  As most of you know, I believe in spiritual gifts when understood biblically.  But you just can't tell a room of people to command things in Jesus' name and expect them all to happen. ",

In his book, The Supernatural Power of a Transformed Mind, he says on page 44 that renewing the mind begins with repentance.  Re means go back and pent is like the penthouse, the top floor of a building.  Repent means go back to God's perspective on reality.  Now, obviously, the word repent has nothing to do with penthouses.  I've spoken on this before, but the original Greek word translated is metanoia and means a change of mind, a change of the inner man, particularly with reference to acceptance of the will of God.

No wonder so many people think Christianity is crazy.  Number 10, all must prophesy.  He says in his video, we must all prophesy.  All of the people of God are carrying prophetic anointing.

            "text": "The Bible says in 1 Corinthians 12, 29, are all prophets?  And in the Greek language, it implies no.  They have a dead raising team.  Now, I believe people can still be raised from the dead as God wills.  And part of me says, kudos for believing God will still do this.  But this dead-raising team is run by Tyler Johnson and was lauded by Bill Johnson in a sermon in 2008, in which he commended it as a ministry to be supported and promoted by the congregation.  Their goal is simple, raise the dead.  To date, this team claims to have raised 12 people, but of course there's no evidence of even one of these claims.  But not only that, we get all the sidetracked attention like we saw with Raising Olive.  People are writing songs, coming together, and using the situation to even raise money.  12.  Grave-Sucking or Mantle-Grabbing.  This false teaching is believed and practiced by some in Bethel, including Senior Pastor Benny Johnson.  This teaches that we can lay on a dead person's grave and soak up their anointing.  In an interview, Bill Johnson has said that neither he nor Bethel encourages the practice of gravesucking.  However, in his book, The Physics of Heaven, Johnson says there are anointings, mantles, revelations, and mysteries that have lain unclaimed, literally where they were left because the generation that walked in them never passed them on.  believe it's possible for us to recover realms of anointing realms of insight realms of god that have been untended for decades simply by choosing to reclaim them and perpetuate them for future generations.  this is nothing short of witchcraft and is found nowhere in the bible 100 lies.  recovering or reclaiming someone's anointing is a man-made doctrine and taking advantage of people's ignorance.  not to mention that Bill Johnson and Chris Volaton are both big fans of the creepy cult leader William Branham.  Branham was so detached from biblical Christianity that even Word of Faith founder Kenneth Hagin called him a false teacher and predicted he would die two years before it happened from a car accident in 1965.  Now, although he died on December 24th, 1965, Branham's followers refused to bury his body since they believed he would raise from the dead.  They finally gave up and buried him on April 11th of next year.  Some of the things Branham preached and believed or didn't believe in, Branham didn't believe in the Trinity.  Branham believed that he was the end-time Elijah.  Branham taught that Eve and the serpent had sexual intercourse and Cain was born.  And consequently, every woman potentially carried the literal seed of the devil.  So he was always believing women to be inferior and untrustworthy.  Branham was a pathological liar who told many variations of stories for decades with conflicting details.  Bill Johnson and Chris Vallotton have stated that they want the mantle of this guy, William Branham.  Watch this. ",
