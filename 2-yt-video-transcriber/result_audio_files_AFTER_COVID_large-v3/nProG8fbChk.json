            "text": "All right, what's happening, fam?  LAR movement still moving.  Subscriber.trian, you see the thumbnail.  So you looking for Mr.  Right now?  You want him to get your life right now?  Listen.  As you keep seeing over and over again, because Kevin keep having these clips.  We've been doing this in this space for years, though, right?  Shout out to Kevin.  You're seeing too many, an abundance of women who... have kids, who are overweight, who abide and try, who overvalue their looks, who are delusional, let's just put it like that.  You see too many people who are also angry, bitter, jaded, entitled, self-centered, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.  But now you're looking for Mr.  Nice Guy.  Now, I'm just looking for a good man.  You're looking for a good man to do something for you.  Once again, you're looking for a Mr.  Nice Guy to show up and do something for you that will help you because he ain't a real man unless he makes your life a little bit better, right?  So now that you're looking for Mr.  Nice Guy now, he's just supposed to automatically just choose you, right?  You Willie Hutch, huh?  If anybody knows that reference.  Y'all know the UGK song, though.  I choose you, babe.  That's Willie Hutch.  Choose it, love or not.  Anyway, now you're in the predicament, well, for some odd reason, this guy is supposed to help you raise your kids that you don't want to co-parent and raise with their father or fathers if you have multiple fathers, multiple kids by multiple men.  Now you're looking for Mr.  Nice Guy after you've been for the streets and now you want to be for the house.  So now you want to be a wife.  when you was a wife to the streets, but you put that down.  You know, now you want that guy to also be Mr.  Nice Guy and still be certain height, certain build, certain amount of money.  Certain amount of swagger.  See, you're not going to skimp out on all of your needs and wants.  You're not going to say, you know what?  I'm asking too much.  No, you're going all in.  You know what?  I'm putting all my dusty chips on this dusty table and I'm going all in and I'm trying to get the cleanest thing out here.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, put your eyelashes in when you're going all in.  You got your weave when you're going all in.  The different color when it go all in.  Oh, yeah.  You got the different baby daddies going all in.  Yeah.  So now you're looking for a savior.  But it's the reason why you get more and more upset because ain't nobody trying to save you.  Because there's nothing in it for these Mr.  Nice Guys that you happen to be looking for now.  You weren't looking for them five years ago.  You weren't looking for them 10 years ago.  How many of y'all started looking for Mr.  Nice Guy after when the pandemic hit and you were really just, life was really just tough?  You know?  Now I can't, you know, I need to subsidize what I was doing when I was for the street because I had people giving me this and giving me that.  Now I need a nice guy to subsidize me because COVID made sure that I can't be for the streets no more.  I can't get the street benefits.  And that's why I got the lady on the thumbnail because you looking real hard, real, real hard, real, real hard.  Honey, I got something for you.  Nothing.  And then you forgot something.  All of you ladies who are looking real hard for Mr.  Nice Guy, y'all got to compete with another bunch of you ladies looking for Mr.  Nice Guy.  Not just the women who are actually better women than you, but also the herd of women who are just like you want that same guy too.  And he's supposed to pick me.  Oh, y'all, he's supposed to pick me.  Because I'm special.  I'm pretty and I'm smart.  Listen, no.  You get the point, though.  Like, share, subscribe at Diatron.  Catch you on the next one.  Peace.
