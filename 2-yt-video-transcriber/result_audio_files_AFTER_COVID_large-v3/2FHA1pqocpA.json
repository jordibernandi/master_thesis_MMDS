Much of the British media is a cesspit of racism, legitimising bigotry and fuelling far-right extremism, which is a threat to minorities in this country.  Now, today I went on the BBC and I challenged Fraser Nelson, the editor of the right-wing Spectator magazine, about his publication's history of printing racism and defences of neo-Nazis.  Well, let's just see what happened.  Roll the tape. ",

One of the things that complicated the attempts to deal with a genuine problem that existed on the left were people with no credentials to talk about racism coming on national television to grandstand in the way Fraser Nelson has.

He's still published by The Spectator, good enough for The Spectator, booted out of the Labour Party for racism.  No, no, no.  He publishes articles which praise Greek neo-Nazis.  He published one article entitled In Defence of the Wehrmacht.  Other articles which say there's not enough Islamophobia... ",

Then Golden Dawn became very popular with certain poor Greeks while it defended them from being mugged by Albanian criminals and drug dealers and for safeguarding older folk after bank withdrawals.  Golden Dawn members might need some lessons in social etiquette.  But what the Beyond Ponson need much more is to get off the pot on their double standards.
