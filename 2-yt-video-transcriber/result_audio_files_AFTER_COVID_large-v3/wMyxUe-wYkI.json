Today's video will be a bit on the shorter side because we're going to quickly debunk this video.  then we can go back to talking about topics that actually matter.  I got a few good ones lined up for the upcoming weeks.  I won't be taking any days off YouTube for the holidays because it's not like I'm going to be traveling anyway.  Might as well pull my hair out responding to nonsense on the internet.  What has my life become?  Anyway, here's a video of Eric DeBay responding to someone talking about the flat earth.  It seems he's developed a pattern where he speeds up his videos for whatever reason.  I don't think it's very necessary, but whatever.  Honestly, if you're going to speed up anything, you should speed up your own voice. ",

For example, mirages and light refraction over the surfaces of oceans.  You can show them thousands of examples of a boat dipping below the horizon, but as soon as one example of light refraction appears where you can still see the ship comes up, they cling onto it like it's their bible.

I haven't seen a single flat earther believe that, so it just gives them ammo to say you don't understand their position.  Honestly, if they did believe in the upwards acceleration of the earth, it would probably be more credible than what they believe now.  I mean, you'd essentially be giving flat earthers credit that they would somehow know that gravity is an acceleration, because otherwise they would just claim the Earth is moving upwards rather than accelerating upwards.  So they would actually be more credible claiming that instead of the stupid density argument they most often spew.  Plus, they would have demonstrated more understanding of science.  It's a shame.  We gave them this incredible opportunity to show us they at least understand what gravity is, but they reject it nonetheless.  Very ironic, isn't it?

Okay, so yes, denser objects are going to fall.  Less dense objects tend to rise.  However, there's one crucial flaw to this argument, and that is direction.  Why do more dense objects fall downwards and not travel in any other direction?  Sure, if you were given two objects, you could tell which one was more dense, but why downwards?  Why not up or to the side?  Why down?  See, gravity makes a lot of sense because it pulls things towards the center of massive objects, which in this case is the Earth.  But your theory does not specify direction.  In addition to that, whenever an object moves, there has to be a force involved, which means whatever is pulling your denser object downwards is a force.  What is that force?  You give us such vague explanations, but do not answer the dozens of questions that follow afterwards.  And the thing is, there is no answer.  You people can't think outside of your tiny bubble to answer the most basic questions that trail your explanations.
