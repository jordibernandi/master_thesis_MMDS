They talked about having a plan and how good the plan was going to be.  It was going to be the best plan with the best benefits for everyone.  But the fact of the matter is, is they had no plan because they had no solution that was better than Obamacare.  And they were, of course, not going to give us Medicare for all.  And so they spent two years trying to repeal Obamacare.  And when they couldn't repeal it in its entirety, they tried to take it apart piece by piece.
