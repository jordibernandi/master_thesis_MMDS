            "text": "All right, we're doing something on the fly today.  Late last night, I was scanning Twitter.  Why am I scanning Twitter?  I don't know, but I was scanning Twitter and I saw a video that started going viral of a young black man who was on a Southwest flight and being kicked off the flight.  And it seemed to have something to do with the fact that he was wearing a Trump 2020 mask and he had a Black Voices for Trump hat.  And there was a supervisor from Southwest kicking him off the plane.  There was a woman narrating it and a couple other people people that got involved.  it didn't sound like he did anything wrong because you obviously are allowed to take your mask down when you're when you're eating or drinking.  uh thanks to the sleuths on the internet we have been able to locate that guy philip nadifan and his friend his co-worker actually who filmed the whole thing, Chris Ann Hall.  It turns out that Chris Ann Hall is a constitutional expert, and they were traveling the country teaching the Constitution, and Philip was doing some video work for her, so it's sort of a perfect fit on a couple fronts.  So what we're gonna do right now is we're gonna play most of the two videos that went viral so that you can see the context of what happened.  And I should just note that I did, before we play the interview, I did talk to them for a minute or two before and I have assurances from them that nothing happened outside of the video that would imply that they were trying to get publicity or that this was staged or anything else.  So we're gonna play the viral videos and then we're gonna go into my interview with Philip and Chris Ann Hall.  And I just wanna say one other thing, which is that the reason that I wanted to do this is that this is a young black man who was just kicked off a flight in effect for no reason.  And we certainly know that if he didn't have a Trump mask or a Black Voices for Trump hat, that this is the type of story as he was kicked off by a white supervisor.  that the media would love, and this would be being played everywhere, and this would be the head of CNN, and celebrities and Democratic politicians would be telling you this proves systemic racism and the rest of it.  But because he is a Trump supporter, you're gonna see some clips of this on YouTube, and you'll see some clips of it on Twitter, but it won't make it to mainstream.  It just won't, mark my words.  As I'm taping this right now, it's about 8  a.m.,  it's not even 8  a.m.,  here in Los Angeles.  And I'm willing to take the risk that this thing is not going to be on MSNBC or CNN today unless we force the issue.  So that's what I'm trying to do here because I think it's important.  It's important to see because the people that will tell you that everything is racist seem to only see racism when it fits their narrative.  So without further ado, here's the original viral video and then my interview with Philip and Chrisann. ",

And guess what?  There were black people, white people, gay people, straight people.  Latino people and nobody cared.  All right, so since you are a constitutional lawyer, I suspect there's going to be some legal action on the way.  Am I mistaken? ",

Although I am a constitutional lawyer, I don't have a trigger.  So I don't go around and sue everybody.  I want everybody to have the opportunity to make things whole without entering into the field of litigation.  I'd like to see an amicable relationship.  I have personally been flying Southwest for over 10 years.  And for me, their customer service has been impeccable.  And so I want to know as a customer that this is not the view of Southwest, that this is just some flight attendant that got upset or triggered and is letting his own bias override his professionalism.  So I want Southwest to have the opportunity to make us whole in that. ",

I'm glad to hear that because I think, you know, people see these videos and they automatically think, oh, something must have happened right before or these guys are just trying to get into a lawsuit.  And and it genuinely doesn't sound that way.  with you guys.  Philip, you know, I find that there's moments over the last couple years where I've interviewed somebody where it's like, oh, they're about to step into something much bigger if they want it.  If you were introduced to Candace Owens and Brandon Tatum and Larry Elder and all those guys, do you want a louder voice in that Black Voices for Trump movement?  Because I know a guy. ",
