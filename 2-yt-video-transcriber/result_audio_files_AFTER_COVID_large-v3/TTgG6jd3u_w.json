            "text": "When God Himself came down in the flesh as a man, He revealed secrets kept hidden from the beginning of the world, some of which He revealed in parables.  Amongst other reasons, this was so that arrogant men would be blinded, whilst those who were humble and sought out the Holy Spirit of Christ would have their eyes opened and the truth revealed to them.  Even today, preachers, politicians, and so-called wise men are completely blind to the truth.  and absolutely do not understand the Bible.  so here are the top 10 parables.  Jesus Christ explained number one the old and new wineskins.  Christ said you can't put new wine into old wineskins.  when one has a true awakening where they come to the truth of Christ there's always going to be conflicts with old doctrines and old beliefs.  that person has already been taught.  you see there are teachings of the world and then there are the teaching of Christ.  it's one or the other.  it can't be both but most people simply can't choose.  so they instead do exactly what Christ tells them not to do.  they try to pour that new gospel of Christ the new wine into their old beliefs that old wineskin.  and what happens?  it bursts.  it simply doesn't work.  they are not compatible.  You have to discard all doctrines, be it Catholic, Orthodox, Protestant, and everything else the world teaches.  You have to get rid of it all, start completely over, and read the Bible for yourself.  Whatever it teaches, that is now your new wine and your new wineskin.  To the sower.  Now speaking of that new wine skin, some people, they hear the message, they like it, it sounds good, it resonates, it tickles the ears, but they never actually go and read the Bible themselves.  They don't take any time to study, to research history in order to validate it all.  so when they are challenged on their beliefs or when life gets hard they desert christ.  they flee from him and return to how they used to be.  others simply jump from teacher to teacher from this interpretation of the bible to that interpretation following different doctrines never quite knowing or being certain which one is true.  these people never built a firm solid foundation a true understanding of the gospel for themselves.  for them the seeds never grew.  they withered away but some or should i say a very small amount.  they do.  take that time and effort to study and their foundation becomes unshakable in this age where satan's deception is everywhere.  if anything it is even more important to plant your seeds in good soil or build your house on rock three the pharisee and the tax collector.  sadly many christians today are christians in name only.  they don't follow the law or christ's commandments.  they don't seek to do what is right.  they don't help their brethren yet they are convinced simply because they use the name christians.  they are good people.  These people will put themselves and believe themselves to be above other people in society because of their status or wealth.  So here Christ is explaining, don't worry about that.  In heaven they will be humbled and brought down low, whilst those in life who had little are low status, but did good and helped.  their brethren will be raised, they will be elevated.  So we should always be humble and never put ourselves above our brothers.  For the rich fool, the law of money can be hard to resist.  Even for Christians who are very awake and aware of the deception of Satan.  They understand and truly believe in Christ.  Yet they are still consumed by greed and I see this all the time.  How many times do you see Christian pastors only really interested in selling books?  How many friends do you have obsessed with investing in the stock markets?  Or following those truffa channels, advising them to load up on precious metals like gold and silver.  They need a pension one, a pension two, multiple residual incomes, a few holiday homes, it's never enough.  So here Christ is explaining, well what if you drop dead right now, this instant or tomorrow?  If you're in heaven, what good were all those years of pursuing wealth?  What does it really get you?  Absolutely nothing.  5.  The Good Samaritan.  This is probably Christ's most famous parable, but there's a lot more to it than people realize.  So first we have a Levite, a priest, and a Samaritan.  Now the priests were Levites, yet here we see they are distinguished.  By the time of Christ, Herod, who was an Edomite, was king.  He was putting his own people in power.  so anyone could now be a Levitical priest even the high priest.  you could just buy your way into it.  then we have the Samaritans.  a lot of these were real Israelites.  when the Assyrians deported the Israelites many in the region of Ephraim were able to flee and come back.  afterwards the region got renamed to Samaria.  later after babylon deported the people in jerusalem and they returned they refused to acknowledge those people in samaria as israelite brothers.  this shows what shambles the law had become at the time.  it had become completely distorted.  so how do you know who is who?  who is your brother or neighbor?  christ explains that you will know them by their behavior or by their fruits.  six the rich man and lazarus.  a lot take this one literally and on the surface it looks like there really is a burning hell where people go for eternal suffering.  but it is but a parable and there's a deeper message expressed by it.  when God revealed the Ten Commandments on Mount Sinai to his people they later settled in the lands of Canaan amongst other people who tempted the Israelites to stray away from the law for they themselves never truly understood it.  most of the Pharisees at the time of Christ likewise were merely pretending to keep the law.  it was all show they didn't care for it let alone believe it while christ having performed miracles before their very eyes and even coming back from the dead being resurrected.  well if they didn't believe in the law of moses or the prophets and were just pretending all along then they would still even refuse to believe in christ.  they are permanently in darkness.  7.  The Ten Virgins.  The first thing that jumps out is why are they virgins?  Well, God married the Israelites collectively.  That's how he saw it and that's how he described his relationship with Israel.  And the law was the wedding contract.  So when they began to practice whoredom, worshipping Baal and other foreign gods, they collectively committed adultery.  The penalty was death.  so when Christ came he being God called himself the bridegroom because he wanted to remarry his people.  however the law forbade a man from taking back his adulterous wife.  so there was a way around that Christ had to die.  this way his wife the children of Israel would be released from the curse and the penalties of the law but upon his resurrection he could take them back and remarry them.  so when we accept Christ we are that virgin.  we're awaiting that supper of the lamb the marriage in heaven.  but some of these virgins don't have oil.  they're not actually doing good deeds keeping the law helping their brethren.  so their lamp is not burning.  so when they do get to heaven they will regret.  so get out and do good for your people.  get that lamp burning.  eight the divided kingdom.  Christ explains that no kingdom can stand when it is fighting itself.  We see that Satan over the centuries has certainly learned this lesson and taken it to heart.  They have turned our own countries against each other, creating endless wars and chaos to destroy us, always remaining behind the scenes as the invisible hand.  in the modern era creating party systems where you're either on this side or that side to keep us divided.  furthermore for those who do realize what's going on and seek out the truth the enemy has set up an endless amount of gatekeepers to pretend to help but in reality to control every possible opposition angle and this is all to keep our kingdoms divided.  the point is for us to truly unite.  the only way is under christ everything else is vanity and everything else is doomed to fail.  nine the mustard seed.  it starts off as the smallest seed in the garden which ends up becoming large and great.  adam and eve started as just two in a world of fallen angels giants and all their corrupt offspring.  The remnant of Noah was just 8 people when civilizations started anew.  The children of Jacob started out as just 12 and they grew to 12 tribes who against the world, against entire kingdoms and nations.  And yet over the centuries their numbers grew and they became many nations themselves.  We are indeed a people of humble beginnings.  Now notice the last bit how the birds of heaven came to nest in the tree.  Well, those are those fallen angels and their descendants.  10.  The sheep and the goats.  This is probably the most misunderstood parable ever.  Jesus explains that the sheep go to heaven and the goats to the lake of fire.  Now note that there are no good sheep who go with the good goats and bad sheep who go with the bad goats.  Rather, there are sheep, good or bad, and there are goats, good or bad.  A sheep cannot transform into a goat, and vice versa.  The destiny is predetermined by the origin.  If you descend from Adam, you are a sheep.  God created all the Adamites to be immortal.  If you are a corruption, well, you descend from the fallen angels.  Then you are a goat.  You don't have the Adamic spirit.  God breathed into Adam which was passed on through his descendants.  So if that's the case then, what is the point in doing good or doing bad?  Heavenly reward.  Simple.  Good sheep who do good towards other sheep get rewards in heaven, whilst bad sheep do not get reward, but shame and everlasting contempt.  This was the message Christ spread around from the beginning, the true gospel, which got him killed.  But as he showed up by his resurrection, we have nothing to fear.  Thank you. ",
