            "text": "Good morning people, WatchHuman65, Lisa Boyce here.  I'm going to give you some news this morning.  I'm going to give you the gospel first, which is the good news.  Christ died for our past, present, future sins, was buried and rose again on the third day according to scripture.  We're saved by grace through faith in Christ alone, no other way.  Once we accept Christ as Savior, we are sealed until the day of redemption.  It is grace that we are saved.  Grace through faith in Christ alone.  It is grace that God gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believe in Him will not perish.  Whosoever believe in Him will not perish but have eternal life.  The key word is believe.  That's all we have to do is believe in what He did for us.  When we accept Christ as Savior, we believe him.  and what in his blood and what he shed for our past present and future sins at the cross of Calvary doesn't get any simpler than that.  and that's the gospel can't take away can't add to it.  it's a pure simple gospel.  now I'm gonna give you this because I had said something was happening.  Now, I kind of believe this.  Something is happening.  700 National Guard members being deployed to D.C.  to support Secret Service.  Now, something, like I said last night, something's going on.  I have no idea what, but something is going on.  It goes on to say, just days after 500 Massachusetts National Guard members returned home after helping to provide security for last week's inauguration, the state announced it is sending 700 guardsmen to D.C.  to support, listen to this, the United States Secret Service.  Why would you need to support the Secret Service?  Kevin just told me he believes it's for this impeachment trial.  And that could be the case.  I don't know.  Governor Charlie Baker signed an executive order Monday approving up to 700 Massachusetts Air and Army National Guard personnel for the mission, which was requested by the Department of Defense, National Guard Bureau, and the Secret Service.  They didn't do this for BLM and Antifa.  So something is going on right here.  And like I said, Kevin said that it might be for this impeachment trial.  Really?  The soldiers will be traveling to D.C.  over the coming days and are expected to return to the state on February 23rd.  Now I think, and I could be wrong, but I think the impeachment trial starts February 8th.  I don't know.  No further details on the reason for their deployment was released, but the state said it is separate from the personnel who served in support of the inauguration.  Baker's office said the activation will not interfere with the National Guard's ability to respond to and assist with emergencies here in Massachusetts.  So, it looks like something is going on but they don't have any details about what it says.  it says that the military newspaper Stars and Stripes has reported that up to 7,000 National Guard troops could remain in D.C.  through March 12th because of concerns of more violence after January 6th attack on the U.S.  Capitol by a mob of people supporting President Trump.  State and public safety officials said that the soldiers and airmen who are traveling will undergo pre-departure health screenings and COVID-19 tests and will be required to wear masks.  Can you see the expression on my face?  They will also be housed in individual rooms while deployed to the DC area to reduce virus transmission risk.  Something's going on.  Simple as that.  I'm going to keep track of this because Like I said, something is up.  And they're not telling us what it is.  But I will come back later and give you more.  Possibly about this.  But this is all I got so far.  This is off of Channel 10 Boston News.  So, in the meantime, I have prayed for you people.  I consider you my family.  I thank you highly for your support.  And I thank you for your prayers.  I pray for my subscribers daily.  Just know.  Sometimes twice a day.  Because I know you all need encouragement and I know you all need prayer.  For whatever reason.  Healing.  Whatever reason.  But know that I pray for you guys every day.  And... Like I said, when you see news like this, look up.  Because it's actually good news for the church.  I titled that video yesterday.  2021 is going to be possibly the worst year for mankind.  Excuse me.  Possibly the worst year, but it will be the best year for the church.  I'm sorry.  I feel that we're out of here this year.  People can come against me and say whatever, but I feel that we're gone this year.  But anyway, I'll be back later.  Thank you. ",
