And now it's burning because you guys are sitting here defending a murderer.  Just like fucking the Nazi soldiers.  This is fucking sad.  You're just doing your job.  I know plenty of students who still go here on the daily.  He's not here.  Jenny Gray Owl is a fucking elder and her parents started McGizzy Communications.  This is the last of what the fuck she had from them.  This shit ain't even right, man.  I'm about to be 23 years old.  I've been going through this McGizzy Communications for 10 years since I was a fucking freshman in high school.  13 years old.  I've been a part of McGizzy Communications.  And now this shit's just burning.  I don't know if y'all remember the May Day parade last year when we had that big woman who represented the missing and murdered indigenous women.  I know that woman in there, that paper mache woman, made national news too.  She was freaking tall and she's in that fucking building waiting to burn.  She's a representation of our women who go missing and she's in that building burning.  you guys have caused so many fucking injustices and you guys are sitting up here defending a fucking murderer.  you guys tell me if not one fuck and that's a damn shame.  I know you guys got kids too.  I know you guys got high schoolers or will be high schoolers.  And I know you guys want them to have the programs that McGizzy offers.  Media internships, technology internships.  They did Native American cultural awareness programs, sacred voices.  I was a part of that.  All of my youth leadership came out of this building with the help of the people who started this or who worked in this building.  And y'all sitting here letting it fucking burn over a fucking pillar. ",
