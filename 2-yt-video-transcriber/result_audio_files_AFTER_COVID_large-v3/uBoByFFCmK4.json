            "text": "September the 17th, 2020.  Guys, you're looking at the 7 p.m.  update.  It just hasn't been out long now, and this is on the new tropical depression number 22.  We've had quite a few this year.  The sustained winds are 35 miles per hour.  It's moving north and east.  You can see the direction at the bottom, north and east, up towards the Louisiana coast at 5 miles an hour.  It's not that fast.  fast but again at 35. tomorrow 2 p.m 40 and then you start seeing an increase in speed up to 70 miles an hour by sunday at 2 a.m.  staying that way through sunday it's showing it decreased some without coming ashore.  on monday 2 p.m down to 65. tuesday at 60 miles an hour still offshore.  Now think the reason it's slowing down, even though it's in warmer waters, is because the models are showing this thing turning back.  into the Gulf and headed back northeast, and I think that's why they have not put anything coming ashore yet.  I want to look at, which this is a newer update, it's been out 26 minutes, but I want to look at some of the things here.  Most all the models have this thing almost coming ashore, except one, the HWRF model, and it shows it coming ashore around Houston, then looping back.  The Canadian model has it coming very close to shore, looping back.  the navy model has it coming very close to shore then looping back.  and you can see some of the other models but a lot of them are showing it not really coming ashore.  notice how far south it was at this point.  see in the yellow models canadian model when we see that dip south.  Well, that's what we're seeing.  You come in here, starts to dip south towards Mexico.  Then they have it coming up.  And what it's doing is it's battling a high pressure system.  that's here.  And you're going to have valleys and peaks in this.  And as this senses it, the storm senses this high pressure area, it's going to change it left and right.  But I want to look at some of the longer term forecast modeling itself.  Now here we're going to look at three different models.  This is the ECMWF European model, and we're going to look at the Navy model and the Canadian model also.  But notice how the storm in the Gulf pulls up, dips back, comes back, and watch.  Let me slow it down just a little bit.  Right there, it comes back up through central Louisiana and at the coast of central Louisiana and then up through Mississippi again here.  It dives in, gets caught up in an opening in the high-pressure system.  You see that?  And it's pulled.  As it's wrapped up, see how the high pressure is coming all the way down into Mexico?  That's a blocker.  And we get this gap.  And where this gap fluctuates and that peak rises will be where the storm comes ashore.  Notice how powerful.  Teddy is in the Atlantic, guys.  It's a very good thing this thing is not coming ashore.  Look at this.  Very strong.  One of the strongest we've seen this year.  But you're going to have to watch it up, guys, Nova Scotia and that area.  Now let's look at the Navy model, guys.  This is the entire Atlantic, not just the Caribbean view.  And you can see where this very powerful teddy is going to come ashore, guys.  The northeastern United States looks like they're going to take a lick.  This is the newest models that are just coming out.  Look at this.  Very powerful storm slams into, what is that, guys, Long Island right in that area?  Check that out again.  I'm going to have to keep a very close eye on it.  I said it for the last few days.  It's lucky this thing's not coming.  But this last model is showing this high pressure.  Look at that in the red.  Stopping it and pushing it back ashore.  right in here.  check this out.  the pink and hot pink.  the red.  this is the highest section of the high pressure out into the orange down into the golden colors and notice how strong the storm is how tightly it's wrapped.  you can see it's very low in pressure at the bottom here.  this is on.  this would be what tuesday on the 22nd guys but the high right here is going to stop.  it had been projected to move more out into the Atlantic at this point.  Maybe scrape right there.  But now, again, this is the first time I've seen this one.  It's been a couple hours since I checked it.  It definitely looks, as we move this forward, I'm just going to step it forward.  That's the 22nd, 23rd, guys.  Look at that.  23rd.  Is that Wednesday?  Eyes almost fully sure.  There it is.  Look at that.  This is going to be a big deal.  Different parts of the nation.  Think about it.  Louisiana, Florida, and Alabama, they're still shut down down there, guys.  I've talked to people and text people.  No power whatsoever.  Think about it.  And here on the 24th, I'm going to let it, I'll tell you what let's do.  Let's just kind of back this up and look at the evolution of both storms.  Here's the 19th.  Let's come back to the 17th.  here we've got the storm forming.  here it's actually much stronger than it appears here.  some of the daylight satellite images was showing a very well organized lower level circulation.  guys the surface there.  but um we'll move this thing forward now going up into the 18th nineteen starting to strengthen.  now this is the one in the gulf notice that's getting tight right there starting to get into that blue and purple.  even tighter there along the texas coast almost comes ashore south of galveston and houston area Right there, this is on September the 21st.  Would that be Monday?  Let's see, close to that anyway.  But as we step it through, it's caught up in that high pressure area that's pushing this large storm teddy, I think it is, ashore.  And it pulls, it allows this storm a gap.  it's almost the fujia air effect.  do you understand what i'm saying?  it's a new phenomena that they haven't seen much and they started talking about more and more this year where a larger storm or two storms close together will affect each other.  they can actually orbit a central location the way that sun the sun and jupiter does.  by the way the jupiter does not orbit the sun the way the other planets do.  they or the sun and jupiter have such mass between them that there's a point outside the surface of the sun that they rotate around.  you can look that up.  And so that's what is created when you have storms close together.  I'm not sure if these two are close enough, but this one is definitely affecting and being affected by the high pressure area that is now gone.  And it's going to allow the storm in the Gulf to pull back.  So let's step it.  Go ahead and step it forward.  We're into the 24th.  comes ashore a little further south in louisiana than the european model.  notice that's not the movement of this storm.  this is actually the model going back to the 17th.  notice that that's kind of the remnant low pressure system part of sally today.  but again here's that storm and i'm just going to let it play full at full speed through the model Intense strengthening here.  Slams really hits hard, guys, up in the New York area.  And at the same time, we've got one coming in around Louisiana.  Much smaller storm, but it could be very concentrated.  This thing is huge.  Look at that.  Major warnings, guys.  We hope, with all the troubles that they're having now, that this thing goes back out and dissipates.  But as it does that, guys, it's going to move up the coast.  Now, looking at the Canadian model, it looks a lot better for the eastern United States in this model for sure.  Now, it doesn't even strike anywhere close to where the Navy model is, so we're going to have to keep an eye on it as we go through the week.  And back into the guff there, you see the storm lagging along the Texas coast now.  The one in the guff, number 22, pulls back out and then heads north in the last frame up towards Florida, and that's on the 27th, the location there.  And check this out.  Just a big wobble as that low-pressure system changes and it reforms.  That could send it a little further south into Florida than the panhandle.  Again, we're a few days out.  Let's look at some satellite images to end the video.  But before I forget, let's look at this particular model of Hurricane Teddy.  It's a 140-mile-per-hour storm.  Now, guys, Cat 4. it this is showing the average of the models and it's going up into nova scotia missing the northeastern united states.  again you can never discount what the canadian excuse me the navy model especially when they're looking into the atlantic ocean.  look at this hundred forty five mile an hour winds nine hundred forty five millibars pressure Coming ashore here Tuesday, 2  p.m.,  90 miles an hour, somewhere just off the shore.  So we're going to have to keep an eye on it, but it's a very powerful storm.  Now, let's take a look at the satellite images.  Now, this is zooming way back.  There's a lot happening here.  Here's Sally that did so much destruction, guys, along the Panhandle area.  They're still suffering and trying to recover.  But look at this monster in the Atlantic called Teddy.  right there.  so guys hope that the canadian model is right and most of the u.s misses this and canada.  okay let's keep your fingers crossed because you do not want this storm coming ashore in new york because it won't be a cat one at that latitude.  here is what we're dealing with in the government.  we're going to take a look closer look at it and here in the bottom right corner is something that we're watching too.  it's been storm after storm after storm.  many are turning into the atlantic.  i knew that was going to change somewhat and the east coast would have to start watching this.  maybe the navy is sensing that too Going directly over the Gulf of Mexico itself, guys, there's some glitches in the Internet tonight, and you're seeing that here, and I've seen a very slow movement, uploads, things like that throughout the afternoon.  So I hope this video gets up before too late.  You can see during the day, very good low-level circulation there.  You can see it as it gets night, and it's going more into an infrared satellite image here.  very good low level circulation.  it's starting to try to wrap around the center and it's getting into very warm waters throwing a lot of clouds out to the north and you've got storms that are popping up along the texas and mexico coast and louisiana and texas.  you may get some rain from some of this right here.  some of these clouds are strong.  here's the center right there.  now again it's crazy pattern coming up maybe skirting along texas and looping back down and pulling back across possibly louisiana and going up into the panhandle.  we're just going to have to wait and see on that.  but again very well organized storm.  it's not that big yet it's just 35 miles an hour but it's been strong like this all day.  so i imagine it's going to go into a tropical storm before very long.  Guys, we're watching this.  You watch it.  It's a heads up.  Be safe. ",
