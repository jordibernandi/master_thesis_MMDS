I must take six feet back until the rona goes.  I see a line of cars with people wearing masks.  New normals here, old normals never coming back.  Masked people cover their heads every single day Like Muslim women, they just wear it every day.  I choose to mask myself, I have embraced the mask.  I pledge allegiance to a mask and not a flag.  My free will fades away until I get a vax And when I look at you I think I need a bath.  Bill has a new vaccine to fight the summer blues.  Genomic change is coming soon for me and you.  If they try hard enough, they'll inject everyone.  My genes forever changed, I'll pass them to my son.  I see a normal face, I want it to be masked.  Well, let's talk again about masks.  I scream and run away to save space that I know.  I see them wearing masks, masks, virtual masks everywhere.  They want to give facts, facts But they don't ask what's in there.  Wear a mask in your car. ",
