What's the fire emergency there?  The building's on fire.  Thank you.  Put it down.  What are you?  Make a table.  Why are you in my home?  Put it down.  Why are you in my home?  Put it down.  Why are you in my home?  Put it down.  He's got a knife.  Yeah, I know.  I don't have a knife because I'm cooking.  Put the knife down.  Put the knife down.  I just called the fire department.  Put the knife down.  I thought the fire department had already been here.  Put the knife down.  Why did you just kick in my door?  The door was open with the chain.  I'm knocking on the door.  Put the knife down.  My man, drop the knife.  Why is my door... Drop the knife.  Drop the knife.  Drop the knife.  Drop the knife.  Put the knife down.  Put the knife down, please.  Sir?  Get out!  Get out!  Get out!  Get out!  Get out!  Get out!  It appears to be justified.  They're coming out, and this guy's charging at him with a knife in one hand, a stick in the other, screaming at them in a confined space.  Again, I say this quite often.  Officers have to make a decision in a matter of seconds, and that's what happened here.  Thank you. ",
