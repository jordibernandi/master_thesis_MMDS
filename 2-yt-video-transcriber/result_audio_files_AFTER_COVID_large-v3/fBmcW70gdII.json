Noble's away.  Missy's away.  Toby's away.  Everybody's away right now for this.  They want to work.  Here they come.  Yep.  Yep.  Yep, we got a shepherd.  Okay.  This is Odin.  Odin.  Hi, Odin.  Hi.  Smile, you're on camera.  Odin, can you say hi?  Hi.  Hi.  Okay.  He probably smells noble in everybody else here.  Don't search.  Okay, he's got to find the cell phones.  Okay, let's go.  Here we go.  Okay, so I threw two cell phones into this property somewhere.  He's got to find them.  He's a search and rescue dog.  Yep.  That's probably good training for him.  He probably smells noble.  Look at this.  I threw it right over there.  Hold on.  I threw it over there.  Yep.  Yep.  Odin's leaving a little note for the other dogs here.  All right.  He's got to find the cell phones.  He's in there.  Hold on.  Let's see.  Let's see where he's going to go.  Oh, he's going over there.  Oh, he's got the trail.  Wait, I threw it down there.  Hold on.  So this is a train-searching rescue dog.  Come on.  Hey.  I know there's a lot of smells here, so this is good practice for Odin because we have, you know, a lot of animal smells here that he's probably never smelled before, like a pig.  No.  This way.  Okay, now Odin's going to go.  look.  Odin had to get used to the smells first here.  Really?  Come in, Odin.  I know, Odin.  You're leaving a note for Noble, too.  I don't have it, Odin, but hi.  Hi.  Oh, hi.  I don't know if I'm supposed to pet.  Oh, that's right.  I got liver in my pocket.  Oops, sorry.  All right, he's got to find it.  That's where he threw it.  Hold on.  He's in the area.  There he goes.  You see, now he's getting into it.  He had to get used to the smells first here because we got a lot of smells, which is good practice for him.  Oh, he's signaling.  That's where it is.  That's where it is.  He's signaling to Rick that that's where it is.  That's exactly right through the cell phone.  He's signaling to Rick that that's where it is.  Okay, he found one.  All right.  Way to go, Odin.  Then he gets a reward.  You see, that's what he does.  He gets a reward now.  He gets to play a little because he worked and he found the cell phone.  So Odin is sent out for search and rescue missions.  And so there's a second cell phone here.  It's on the other side of the property.  It's over here.  I threw it.  So now he's gonna work.  He just had to get used to all the smells first.  Here, he's never smelled a lot of this before.  So it's good training for Odin.  He's on the trail.  He's on the trail.  He's on the trail.  He's on the trail.  Yep, here he comes.  Here he comes.  That's where I threw it.  Hold on.  He's a little far down, but he'll find it.  It's up here.  And Rick's not giving him any cues.  He's just walking around with him.  Up.  Wait.  He's circling in on it.  Watch this.  He's got to really use his nose to find the small cell phone.  He's got it.  Oh, he found it.  Look at this.  He got it.  Look at this.  He found it.  And he lays down right where, yep, for Rick.  Isn't that amazing?  oh yep the cell phone's right there.  there it is.  yep he's got it right there.  way to go odin that's a good boy and this is how search and rescue dogs are trained to go out and find people that are missing.  good boy odin.
