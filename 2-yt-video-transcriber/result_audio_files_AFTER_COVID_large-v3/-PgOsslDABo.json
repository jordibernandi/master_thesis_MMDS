            "text": "If you're a little bit like me, you've spent some time exploring some interesting questions about Jesus.  What did he really look like?  Because judging by many of his popular depictions, you wouldn't think he was a carpenter from ancient Palestine.  More like a carpenter from a 1970s Ikea.  Was he concerned about moderation and drinking alcohol?  I mean, turning all the water at a wedding into wine sounds like a good time, but it could also be interpreted as a bit of a cry for help.  Either way, let's just be glad that Jesus did not in fact take the wheel that night.  How rowdy did he get turning over the merchant tables in the temple?  Did he just turn one over and give everyone a sermon?  Or did he really charge in there and yeet those things like a real son of a- God.  Now, if you're a lot like me, you grew up considering and discussing larger theological questions pertaining to Jesus.  Does his turn-the-other-cheek bit imply that he was a total pacifist?  Did his soul suffer in hell for three days for our sins while his body remained in the tomb?  And exactly how does the Trinity work?  These questions are not uncommon in the least.  However, there are certain questions about Jesus, some that have been the subject of furious debate, which most of us have never heard of, much less considered.  Based on what theological narratives are popular in our time and place, most of us assume the answers to these questions one way or another within our theological positions, treating them as a given, a non-issue.  Ancient people closer to Jesus' time, though, probably wouldn't have seen these things the same way.  In fact, the questions we'll explore here were likely quite common among Christians in the first few centuries CE.  Before we finally get to these questions, let me clarify to those of you new to my channel that I am not religious and did not intend to argue for any theological position in this video.  I just really enjoy studying the development of religious systems and thought it'd be fun to just share some things that I've read about with you guys.  So if you'd like to join me for that, let's get to it.  Did Jesus have a physical body?  Yes, this was a very real, serious question which early Christians hotly debated.  It existed within the larger debate over whether Jesus was human, a god, a mix of the two, or something else entirely.  If he was God, they wondered, how could he truly be human?  Humans have needs and limitations that God doesn't have, and if a human doesn't have those needs and limitations because they're divine, Are they really human at all?  Likewise, God presumably has knowledge and abilities which humans don't have, so if one is truly human, wouldn't they lack the knowledge and abilities of God?  To better illustrate why there was disagreement over this question, allow me to contrast two early Christian sects who held to polar opposite views on the issue.  We'll begin with a sect called the Ebionites.  This sect believed, as many early Christians did, that Jesus was a man who, because of his strict and righteous observance of the law of Moses, pleased God so much that God adopted him as his own son on the day of Jesus' baptism.  They did not believe that he was inherently divine or born of a virgin.  Naturally, they thought that Jesus had a physical body, just the same as any other human.  A sect called the Marcionites would have disagreed entirely, or at least that's what available sources seem to tell us.  Unfortunately, the writings of Marcion, the founder of this sect, are lost.  Our sources on Marcionite theology are limited to the writings of its direct opposition, such as early Christian writer Tertullian's work against Marcion.  That said, it's important that we take what's been said about the Marcionites with more than a grain of salt.  The Marcionites believed that the material world, including our physical bodies, was imperfect, even corrupt.  To them, divinity was incompatible with the material world, in this case, the flesh.  So the Jesus they believed in was in some ways the exact opposite from the Jesus of the Ebionites.  He didn't have a physical body made of flesh and blood.  In fact, he was never even born.  Jesus was so truly divine that his appearance must have simply been a projection of some kind, one that had the appearance of flesh and blood, but was somehow just an illusion.  The view that Jesus was fully human only in appearance is called docetism.  To be clear, one doesn't have to think that Jesus' body has no substance or that Jesus was purely an apparition to be a docetist.  This term simply refers to the idea that Jesus appeared to be fully human when he wasn't.  I think it could be argued that there are a lot of docetas still around.  I'd imagine that plenty of Christians, if asked if Jesus had the ability to understand speech as an infant, or read the thoughts of others, or perform physical feats that humans can't typically do, would say, yes, of course.  If he wasn't able to do those things, he wouldn't be an omnipotent God.  So, in this way, I'd guess that plenty of people would indicate their belief that Jesus didn't have the physical or cognitive limitations of humans in being omnipotent, but appeared thoroughly human.  Even so, neither Ebionite or Marcionite theology ultimately came to dominate the Christian world.  Marcion was actually an incredibly successful evangelist, seeing his message become the original and majority Christian view in some areas of Asia Minor.  However, in the ancient Roman world, there existed suspicion toward new or novel religious. ",
