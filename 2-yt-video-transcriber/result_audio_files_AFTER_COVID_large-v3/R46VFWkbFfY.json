I want you to stir yourself up and begin to pray about this because this speaks.  It's very similar to visions Kenneth Hagin had back in the 1960s.  But this is very precise, and it's going to help you to pray for this nation and pray for our president.  But you described it as a shocking visit to the White House where you saw three principalities.  Can you walk us through that? ",

            "text": "Yeah, and just by way of just practical, you know, the prophetic true prophecy always gives us a prayer agenda.  So the reason why we need to stir up our faith and connect is God reveals things to his prophets so that the intercessors and the saints can come alongside and in partnership and prayed into being.  I've never worried about somebody giving me a false word of prophecy.  Why?  Because I take it to the Lord in prayer.  And as I take whatever word I got to the Lord in prayer, the Holy Spirit has a way of helping me to discern what's from him and what's not.  So this encounter that I had that you referenced in chapter two, I had a prophetic dream where I went to the White House and I had a meeting with Donald Trump.  And in the meeting, I walked into the White House, his office, and he was staring in the mirror.  And who stared back at him was the face of Abraham Lincoln, which is very interesting, Alan, because so much in the media right now, you're seeing images of of Abraham Lincoln and Donald Trump.  I'll get to that in a minute.  But as he walked and sat behind his desk in this dream, I said to him, I said, Donald, I'm here to reveal to you the three primary principalities that are facing you and the future of America.  And there was a large window behind his desk.  I ripped open the window, excuse me, the curtain which the word revelation in the greek it literally means in unveiling and unfolding a literal pulling back of the curtain.  so in the dream there's a revelation that came forth and on the white house lawn there were three demonic principalities.  maybe each of them were around 50 to 100 feet tall.  I mean, think about some of those blood, you know, you see on the side of a road sometimes like an inflatable that's been blown up, that's huge, something like that.  And there were three of them, the principality of racism, Which God told me was an ancient evil in this nation.  The second was a principality of radical feminism.  And then the third was the God of Molech, the God of abortion.  And I began to prophesy to Donald Trump.  that the three main principalities that he would face in 2020 was racism, radical feminism, that Jezebel spirit, and then Molech, the god of abortion.  And so, Alan, my perspective of 2020 has been that there has been a wave of racism that swept this nation with the death of George Floyd, the rioting, the looting.  Now we're in that period of radical feminism with Harris from California, Pelosi.  I believe that Jezebel spirit has been raging.  But I believe the closer we get to 2020, the god of abortion, Molech, I believe that it's the vote and the fight in 2020.  It's been racism.  We're in the radical feminism.  It's going to shift back to abortion.  Ultimately, people are going to vote for life.  They're going to vote for conservative justices on the Supreme Court.  And then lastly, the piece about Abraham Lincoln.  Trump looked in the mirror and who looked back at him in the dream was Abraham Lincoln.  God said to me, just as I raised up Abraham Lincoln to issue an Emancipation Proclamation concerning the slaves, so I have raised up Donald Trump, like Lincoln, in an era of crisis, to issue an emancipation proclamation concerning the unborn.  So I believe that there are similar characteristics of Abraham Lincoln raised up in an hour of crisis.  He was a godly man, but he was also known as a troublemaker.  And then you have Trump raised up.  People want to question whether he's saved or not.  He gets himself in trouble, but he's been raised up by God to confront this issue of abortion in America. ",

            "text": "Well, you mentioned in the book on page 30, as a matter of fact, America's on the brink of exile because of the church's passivity and in some quarters support of abortion.  It seems like with the evangelical church especially, abortion's really become a background issue, just one of the issues.  that we consider, but it hasn't been a primary issue.  And I think we've been seeing this week, even with the Republican National Convention, there seems to be a reawakening to this issue.  You quote Francis Schaeffer, who said, every abortion clinic should have a sign in front of it saying, open by permission of the church.  What do you think this is going to look like in the pulpits of America?  What should pastors be doing in regard to this spirit? ",

            "text": "yeah you know i i've been saying you know in this time of quarantine in this time of silence it's actually it's actually on my shirt and that god said to me in the time of silence i'm calling forth a remnant to engage in spiritual violence which is that wholehearted obedience.  So, Alan, I feel like this year, the devil has all has been about the silence of the lambs.  I know it's.  you know, it's a horror, horrible movie, but it's like the silence of the lambs.  It's the mask.  It's it's the year of pie or pay.  it were in the Hebrew calendar, the year of the mouth.  Satan is coming, putting masks over people's mouth.  It's a time of silence, but God is trying to decree, I believe, the roaring of the lion, the lion of the tribe of Judah.  So in pulpits in America, you know, you hear all these people saying, Well, prophets don't get involved in politics.  And I'm like, where are you getting that from?  Prophets in the Old Testament anointed kings.  They released transitional seasons.  Prophets should very much be getting involved in politics.  And what I mean by that is we need prophets and pastors alike behind pulpits telling people, vote biblical values, vote for life, vote for traditional marriage, vote for pro-religious liberty.  It shouldn't matter then if it's Trump or Biden, if it's Democrat or Republican, vote biblical values.  So I believe if ever there was a time to get rowdy, to get loud, but Alan, I want to appeal to our audience as someone that pastored for 12 years, who went from our living room to literally hundreds of people, multiple campuses.  What it comes down to is do leaders love God more than they love people?  Are we willing that big daddy box, and I'm just being real, who gives the most money in the offering, are we willing to preach truth and see that gentleman walk out the door with his money?  I believe many times the pulpits are silent because pastors do not want to get involved in politics, but the truth is, Alan, they're political.  And what I mean by that is they don't want to get involved in politics yet.  They play politics in their church because they pander more to money and crowds than they do the truth of God's word.  And that's a revelation. ",

At Encounter Christ Church, we believe that membership, church membership, should be a means of discipleship.  And we've discovered over the last few months that there are many people around the world who do not at the moment have a church that they call home.  And we believe that everyone should have a local church that they attend.  But should you be in a situation where you do not have a local church of faith-filled believers, we don't want you left out in the dark.  We don't want you out there all by yourself.  So we have established an international online membership program.  Now, this course is not for everyone.  It is a serious discipleship program for those who want to be connected with a local church and want to be held accountable as they grow in the things of God.  If that's what you're interested in, if you don't have a local church that you can be a part of and you want to be a part of the Encounter Today family, then all you have to do is go to EncounterToday.com and click on the membership tab in the menu section, and it'll walk you through the process so that you can begin your journey of discipleship.  We're looking forward to connecting with you and to standing in faith with you.  Go to Encounter Today right now.  hey guys i hope you're enjoying this video.  make sure you like comment subscribe share.  your engagement helps us get the word out.  but i've got an exciting announcement for you coming in 2021. in november of 2021 i'm going to be taking a tour group to israel and to greece as we walk in the footsteps of jesus and in the footsteps of the apostle paul.  this is going to be a life-changing experience and to get more information all you have to do is go to encounter israel.
