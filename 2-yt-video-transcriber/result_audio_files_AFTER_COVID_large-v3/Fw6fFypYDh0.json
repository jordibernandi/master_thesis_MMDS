            "text": "Well, it's a delight to have you join me today.  As most of you know, we spend our YouTube time sharing with you what we consider a right now word that the Holy Spirit gives us or something we've read in the scripture.  that applies to the time in which we're living in.  Now, there will be some other messages that you're going to see coming.  And I call them mini messages, 10 to 15 minutes in the near future that will deal with other subjects.  And I hope you don't miss one of them, because if I'm going to take the time to do these, there's something very significant on each one that you need to hear.  Now.  The other day, I was in the state of Alabama, and I realized that there was a new end-time sign that was being overlooked.  Now, when I say new, it has already been written in the Word, but it's one that is completely overlooked.  And honestly, I've heard the verse quoted, but I've never heard a minister in my lifetime, and I've been in ministry now 46 years, ever stand up and just emphasize this phrase, which is a parallel to the days of Lot.  I've never heard him mention it.  I've never heard him elaborate on it.  So I did a Hebrew word study.  I found out something that's pretty amazing.  And I said, you know what?  I've got to share this on our YouTube channel with the hundreds of thousands of people that watch us.  So let's let's flow together.  Now, first of all.  Jesus made this statement, and it's in Matthew 24, verse 37.  As it was in the days of Noah, so will it be at the time of the coming of the Son of Man.  Now, the days of Noah before the flood are basically Genesis chapter 6, part of Genesis 7.  We then read in Luke's gospel, chapter 17, verse 28, where the Lord also alluded to the days of Lot and said, as it was in the days of Lot, so will it be at the time of the coming of the Son of Man.  And that story of Lot and the signs of Lot's day are recorded there in Genesis chapter 19.  WHEN MINISTERS BEGIN TO REFER BACK TO THE DAYS OF NOAH, THEY BASICALLY EMPHASIZE THE UNIVERSAL FLOOD.  WHEN MINISTERS REFER TO THE DAYS OF LOT, AND WE'RE GOING TO SPEAK SPECIFICALLY HERE OF THE EVANGELICAL MINISTERS BECAUSE A LOT OF OTHER MINISTERS DON'T PREACH ON THE DAYS OF LOT, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THEY'RE SO PARALLEL TO TODAY, SO THEY AVOID IT.  BUT WHEN THEY'RE PREACHING ON THE DAYS OF LOT, THEY OFTEN GO TO GENESIS CHAPTER 19, AND THEY EMPHASIZE THE OLD MEN AND THE YOUNG MEN IN THE CITY AND HOW THERE WAS A PERVERSION OF RELATIONSHIPS OCCURRING BETWEEN THEM IN GENESIS CHAPTER 19.  AND OF COURSE, WHEN WE LOOK AT THOSE TWO TIMEFRAMES, THE DAYS OF NOAH AND THE DAYS OF LOT, THOSE ARE THE ONLY TWO TIMEFRAMES IN THE FOUR GOSPELS THAT THE LORD MENTIONED THAT WOULD BE PARALLEL TO HIS RETURN.  AND SO IN THOSE TWO REFERENCES OF MATTHEW AND LUKE, THE LORD SAYS, EATING, DRINKING, MARRIED AND GIVEN IN MARRIAGE, PLANTING, BUILDING,  ETC.,  WHICH HAVE BEEN GOING ON FOR QUITE SOME TIME, BUT DEFINITELY HAVE INCREASED OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS.  HOWEVER, AND I WANT YOU TO LISTEN TO ME FOR JUST A MOMENT, THERE ARE SOME REFERENCES IN OTHER PLACES OUTSIDE OF GENESIS 19 AND OUTSIDE OF THE TWO REFERENCES THAT I ALLUDED TO.  A MOMENT AGO IN THE FOUR GOSPELS WHERE SODOM IS MENTIONED AND IT GOES INTO MORE DETAIL THAN YOU SEE IN GENESIS 19 AND YOU SEE IN LUKE CHAPTER 17 VERSE 28, THOSE REFERENCES THERE.  The one prophet who began to reveal to you the six or seven detailed sins that were occurring in the city of Sodom is the prophet Ezekiel.  And he was realizing that his generation, the generation that he was writing the scripture and living in that timeframe, We're acting out the same sins of Sodom, even as the same are being repeated today.  And it goes back to that verse in Ecclesiastes 1, 9 and 10.  The thing which has been is that which shall be and that which has been done is that which shall be done.  And there's nothing new under the sun.  And the implication from the wise men Solomon who wrote that is that history repeats itself.  And that's why I believe Jesus alluded to the days of Noah 4200 years ago.  And, you know, I don't remember the exact years later, but many hundreds of years later, the days of Lot.  And so those time frames are going to be parallel.  So let's go and read Ezekiel chapter 16, verse 40 through 40.  I'm sorry, 48 through 50.  This was the iniquity of your sister Sodom.  She and her daughter had pride.  fullness of bread or fullness of food, as it's translated here, abundance of idleness.  Neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.  And they were haughty and committed abominations.  Now, the phrase committed abominations does not go into detail.  But Genesis 19 tells you what the abomination was.  And you can also read in the book of Second Peter and references to Jude as to what the abomination was.  So that's been preached on quite a bit.  We're going to lay that to the side here while we talk about the other references.  Thereover, I took them away as I saw fit.  NOW LET'S LOOK AT SOME THINGS THAT GENESIS 19 AND CHRIST DID NOT MENTION THAT WERE HAPPENING IN THE DAYS OF LAW.  THAT ARE HAPPENING RIGHT NOW.  AND THIS IS WHY MINISTERS SUCH AS MYSELF ARE TELLING PEOPLE, REPENT FOR THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN IS AT HAND AND THE MESSIAH IS GOING TO RETURN, IS BECAUSE OF WHAT I'M ABOUT TO TELL YOU, THINGS LIKE THIS THAT ARE COMPLETELY PARALLEL 100%.  First of all was pride, which is arrogance, feeling superior to others.  And we have a whole group of people in the United States who are called elitists, who are arrogant and full of pride, who literally think they know more and they are better than everybody else in the United States.  You know that.  You see that.  Number two is fullness of bread.  Now, the book of Proverbs would identify this by the word gluttony, which is stuffing yourself with food, not just eating to satisfy the appetite, but eating beyond satisfying the appetite until you just can't hardly move or can't hardly walk.  You want to take a nap because you've just overeating.  So it means overeating gluttony to totally overeat.  They had an abundance of food and they were just gorging themselves with food all the time.  All right.  WHAT IS INTERESTING ABOUT SODOM, EVEN SODOM AND GOMAR AND THE OTHER CITIES IN THE AREA WHERE THEY WERE LOCATED, WHICH WAS BELIEVED TO BE THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE DEAD SEA AREA, IN THIS DAY, WHEN SODOM EXISTED, THE TIME OF LOT, THERE WERE FIVE SPRINGS, ACCORDING TO ISRAELI ARCHEOLOGISTS THAT HAVE STUDIED THE AREA.  that were coming off of mountains into those valleys that the cities were built around.  All cities had to be built around fresh water.  And of course, the Dead Sea is very salty and nothing can live there.  No fish can thrive there and they needed fresh water.  And that has been found or the evidence of it has been found, I should say.  However, In Genesis 13 and 10, it tells you those cities were like the Garden of Eden, which is very lush.  So in the time before the destruction of the city by fire, it was very lush.  It had that area.  I've been there, had palm trees all over the place because of the the weather and so on.  And it was a beautiful area.  Now, they did not help the poor and the needy, meaning that there were a lot of poor and needy people in their city that they were ignoring.  And that's a very frightening thing, because if you read Matthew's gospel, chapter 25, the Lord makes it clear that those whom he favor... are individuals who care for the poor and the needy and feed them and clothe them.  We can never, ever just depend on the government to do that.  That's the church's responsibility.  But that's not the sign I want to talk about.  The sign I want to talk about, and I want you to hear this because I did a... A Hebrew word study.  And as you know, every Hebrew word, or you may not know this, every Hebrew word has a root.  And the root is at least two letters.  You cannot have one Hebrew letter to make a word.  You have to have at least two letters that make up the root of a word.  And sometimes it'll be more than two letters, of course, but you have to have at least two.  The abundance of idleness.  Now, not idle like the word idle of a false god that a person is bowing down to and worshiping, but I-D-L-E.  And when we hear the word idolous, we think of laziness or we think of nothing to do or we think of boredom.  They're idle.  Why are they idle?  Well, they're bored.  Why are they idle?  They have nothing to do.  Why are they idle?  In the New Testament parable, men that didn't have a job were standing around idle, nothing to do, not doing anything, not doing anything with their time.  When I look at this and I find that it's found three times in the King James translation of the Bible in the Old Testament, idleness, the root is so interesting because listen to what it means.  to depress.
