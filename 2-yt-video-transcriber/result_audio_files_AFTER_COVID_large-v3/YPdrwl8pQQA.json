We want to become the most dominant independent news organization in the world, and we're well on our way.  So on June 23rd, I reported that the three founders of the Black Lives Matter Global Foundation, Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors, and Opal Tometi, those are the three women who run this, were all Marxists.  And they admitted it.  And it wasn't a brilliant thing on my part because it's on their website.  Or it was on their website.  They've scrubbed it.  They've taken it down.  Okay, so now they're still Marxists.  but they're not admitting it anymore.  That's not fair.  But you can't find out from their website that they're Marxists.  They probably still admit it.  I don't know how they couldn't.  And also, Black Lives Matter Global Foundation disparaged the traditional family, okay, that you were raised in, that I was raised in.  You got a mom and a dad, kids, and maybe a little dog, and You know, the Cleavers, leave it to Beaver, the Father Knows Best, the traditional family that Americans had for centuries.  Eh, Black Lives Matter, Global Organization, they don't like that.  They want a nuclear family structure.  Okay?  And that was under a page called What We Believe.  That's gone.  That's gone from Black Lives Matter.  Global Foundation website.  So, those of us who are honest and aware, we know what this Black Lives Matter global organization is.  But the students at Texas A&M University, they really don't know.  So our buddies over at Campus Reform, an excellent, excellent investigative outfit, they went to Texas A&M.  Go. ",

Okay, now she wants violence in America.  Put it up on the screen.  Quote, violence is the only way, of course.  No votes, no marching, no spots on cable news, no high fashion magazine covers, no hashtags, no panels.  None of that is going to bring about The liberation black folks deserve, unquote.  So she's calling for violence, yet still gets paid to go on college campuses and speak to the students.  Thought you'd like to know. ",
