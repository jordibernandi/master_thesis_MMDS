So what we're gonna do is we're gonna hand them out jars of my own artisanal mustard.  This is 100% stone ground artisanal mustard, product link in the description.  Let's go right now and find some people that could really use a jar of mustard.  Obviously don't record this, but we only actually have one jar.  So we need to find like a dude without a scar or like a family.  We could give it to one of the kids.  If it's like a guy who's bleeding, YouTube will demonetize it.  So let's just try to find somebody who looks like they need a little help, but not everything, you know?  All right.  Bro, get him.  He looks like really homeless.  Yo, what up, bro?  Listen, it's your lucky day, fam.  Some people say it's Christmas.  I call it Flavus.  We got artisanal mustard for you.  This is my own company.  I started this company.  I was 13 years old.  It's worth $150 million right now.  How does that sound?  Are you getting this?  Can you get me and him, bro?  Thanks, dude.  You got to fucking pay attention, man.  The last time the lighting was bad.  Are you Steve Will Do It?  No, I'm not.  You want to buy a couple of jars of this?  Shout us out on Insta, Twitter, help build our brand.  That's fine, man.  Like a lot of people are doing shit.  I don't even care about the clout.  You know what I mean?  Smash that like button right now if you want to end homelessness.  And what I'm just saying right now is like, it's just.  I'm blessed to be at this point in my life.  I'm 14 years old and I own 12 companies.  Look at the sunset.  Look how fucking beautiful that is.  That's beautiful.  You know Gary Vee, dude?  Bros, it's like Gary Vee says, content is king, but marketing is queen.  Take this monster, bro.  I got you, bro.  Always remember that shit.  Content is king, but marketing is queen.  I'm out.  Yo, I think we did a lot of great work today, so smash that like button if you want to end homelessness.  And remember, your brand shouldn't be about what you have.  It should be about what you give. ",
