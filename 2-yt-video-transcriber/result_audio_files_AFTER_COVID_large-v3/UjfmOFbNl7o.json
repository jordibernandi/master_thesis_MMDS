            "text": "How's it going, everybody?  Today, I wanna go over first an interesting trend I've noticed over the last two weeks, and then I wanna take a look back at the First Step Act and some of the people it's helped.  So I wanted to start here with something I've been seeing as a pretty disturbing trend and which I feel like is indicative of these people having their backs pushed up against the wall.  It's a little scary, but thankfully we have good people protecting the president right now.  But that being said, I wanted to go through them real fast because I think it's interesting that this all happened within seconds.  Less than two weeks, about 10-11 days spent.  Now first, back on August 6th, you had three teenagers which were arrested for jumping the wall into Mar-a-Lago with a loaded AK-47.  Now it says here that they were being pursued by police and that they had a semi-automatic gun in their backpack and jumped the wall at President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort last but probably didn't know where they were.  yeah right okay so you know what i'll tell you what.  if this was the only case maybe i could be inclined to believe that but it is not the only case because a few days later while trump was given a press conference a man bum rushed the secret service on august 10th with a gun and dropped down into a drawing motion and he was shot.  but it looks like that he was trying to kill this cop.  so i guess he could just jump over the fence then And God knows what.  And again, the president's great Secret Service.  I'm sure the guy wouldn't have even gotten close if he did hop the fence.  But it's still scary stuff.  And then later that night, a mysterious fire pops up at a generator plant, JFK Airport.  You can see this footage right here.  Let's go off in the back.  So that could have been potentially really, really bad.  And for some of you that don't know, JFK is in Jamaica, Queens.  which is where the president grew up.  He grew up in Jamaica Estates, which is at the north end of Jamaica.  And this was at the south end of Jamaica, which right by the belt, that's where that was taken.  So that's three instances within a couple of days, one at his Florida residence in Mar-a-Lago, one where he is now at the White House, and then one with the town where he grew up.  filed the next day by someone firing shots at an air force helicopter right by the white house.  one person in the helicopter was injured but the agency didn't specify whether they'd been shot.  they do not believe it's life-threatening thank god but they had shot a bunch of bullets at At this helicopter, at this Air Force helicopter by the White House.  All right.  So that's four instances now.  And then right after that, President Trump had returned to Bedminster because of his brother.  A suspicious plane had entered the airspace and was ignoring NORAD fighter jets to the point where they actually had a fire flares at it to get its attention.  So that is five extremely shady instances, all within a freaking couple days, less than two weeks, four of which happened to do with the president's different residences and one happened to do with his detail.  You have his residence in Mar-a-Lago.  You have his current residence in the White House.  You have where he grew up in Queens.  You have people shooting at their helicopters.  Then you have a suspicious instance at his place in New Jersey.  One right after the other on about a 10-day period.  And I think it's indicative that these people's backs are up against the wall, all right?  I do not think that these are all just rare occurrences, that all these things just happened one right after the other.  And they had called him back.  He had already went to New Jersey, because if you remember, on the same day that this happened, he had said, you won't be seeing me for a while, because he had made a deal to lower prescription drug prices, which he was saying big pharma is obviously not happy.  Duh.  No president has done anything like that.  And it's just an, you're talking an insane amount of money he just took out of their pockets.  So he had went to New Jersey.  They called him right back.  And this happens the second he's back.  So I don't trust this for a second, especially since it was followed right off by their helicopters getting shot at.  And then by suspicious airplanes entering his airspace when he's back in Bedminster for to visit his brother, who unfortunately did pass away.  And he had suffered from brain bleed from a fall that he had taken.  And I thought this was a really nice statement that the president had released.  I said this with heavy heart that I share that my wonderful brother Robert peacefully passed away tonight.  He was not just my brother.  He was my best friend.  He will be greatly missed.  We will meet again.  His memory will live on in my heart forever.  Robert, I love you.  Rest in peace.  Man, that really just breaks my heart for him, especially, you know, he says he was his best friend.  You know, that's how I am with my brother.  So I could totally understand that.  And I just want to say my prayers go out to the president and his family and, you know, everyone who was close to Robert.  And he's in a better place right now.  And I thought this was a really touching statement that he sent.  And hopefully the president has better peace of mind now that Robert's at rest.  But again, that caps off.  A lot of questionable events and that, you know, things are getting really hairy.  It's the last couple months before the election.  These people are showing their true colors by far.  I mean, you don't have to look any further than Twitter where wrong Trump was trending.  I mean, that's just dark, dude.  If you can't put it on hold for one freaking day when someone is grieving... you know that's a bad case.  that is just.  you know.  and here's the guy he gets no credit for anything.  they they hit on this guy over and over again.  his freaking brother dies and they're trending because they just trend nasty stuff and that's the media that starts these trends.  they have their little plants everywhere and they start and they ramp it up and then people go along with it because they're just getting sucked into this hatred and it's really hard to watch.  And thankfully, a lot of people called him out on it, and eventually the hashtag was squashed.  But it's just disgusting.  It's straight up disgusting.  You know, they give this guy no credit.  That's why a lot of people still think they hate him.  They have no idea what he's done.  There are people in this country who have no clue of half the things that Donald Trump has done since he's been in prison.  Just the other day, President Donald Trump has secured a historic deal between Israel and the United Arab Emirates to advance peace and prosperity in the region.  I mean, this could potentially he Donald Trump could have just potentially brought peace to the Middle East and they won't care.  They won't even talk about this.  Nothing.  They'd rather trend nasty things.  And you look at Sean King, you think Sean King would love Donald Trump?  Here's him from two years ago.  I'll be frank and tell you two Democrats that I'm 99% I won't be supporting, primarily because of their dismal history and criminal justice reform over the course of their entire careers, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.  They both helped to build and advance mass incarceration.  Well, yeah.  Absolutely.  He's actually right for once.  Sean King, the race baiter who does nothing but cause turmoil on Twitter, actually said something that made sense.  I mean, Joe Biden, he wrote the historic crime bill that they call the Clinton crime bill that just ramped up mass incarceration.  that was already ramping up.  And Kamala Harris has jailed so many people as a prosecutor.  It's just, it's insane.  But you don't hear this guy talk about the First Step Act, which has helped so many people get released from prison.  You'll never hear this guy give Trump or any of his team any credit.  on any of the things they do.  The guy actually pushed criminal justice reform, probably one of the biggest things any president's done in our lifetime, and you get crickets.  But he'll rail against it, and then, of course, he'll change his mind once his controllers tell him what to do, because this guy, they don't believe in anything they're saying.  You understand?  It's just all a show.  They all just create division, or they create turmoil, or now he's four.  That's it for me.  This is from last week, all right?  That was from two years ago.  Now here's Sean King from last week.  That's it for me.  I'm incredibly proud to see a brilliant black woman and an HBCU grad chosen as vice presidential nominee.  I've done political work my whole life.  It's rarely things dreams are made of.  Kamala Harris is the most progressive VP nominee in American history.  Yeah, okay.  So just compare the two.  Just look at the two and reconcile.  You tell me who's fake.  If he was really believed the things he said in this post, he would be voting for President Trump.  He'd actually be promoting President Trump right now, but he's not because all they do is create division.  sun tzu art of war.  if his forces are united separate them and you know that comes in all forms.  that comes from them.  that comes from people who are pretending to be trump supporters.  you know this is.  there is going to be now over the next two months a push to try and divide everyone into groups because when you're in groups you're easier to manipulate and you're easier to.  you can cause fights and just the whole thing.  so this is going to be one of their tactics and it is pushing up to the election.  and And if people were actually privy to all the things this man has done, boy, it wouldn't even be a contest.  But unfortunately, thanks to the media and thanks to people like Sean King, it is going to be a contest, which means we have to get everyone out to vote, as many people out to vote as we possibly can.  We cannot, not a single person can stay home on November 3rd.  And if that happens, I really think we have enough people to override all their voter fraud.  I mean, come on, everyone on both sides knows what mail-in voting means.  That's why they're pushing for it.  They're all playing dumb like, no, oh, you know darn well it's not.  Yeah, right, please.  They know what it is.  That's why they're pushing for it.  but all their voter fraud in the world.  If we all make sure to go out and vote, and if we work these next couple months to really bring awareness to all the great things the president has done, I think the president has a great chance of being reelected, and I think that's going to be a really happy day.  And really a happy day for liberals too, whether they know it or not, because we will have just re-voted in a president who puts his money where his mouth is.  Unlike leftist leaders like Sean King, who when it comes time to support a president who actually did pass criminal justice reform, is instead opting to vote for the exact opposite.  For those of you who aren't familiar with the First Step Act, here's a little montage that should help clear things up. ",

            "text": "Many people said, in fact, I guess we could say almost all people said that criminal justice reform would never pass.  But we came together as a group.  We worked across party lines and we got it done.  And it's an incredible thing when you see some of the people here so conservative and then some so liberal.  And we just have a lot of great people.  They came together.  They knew it had to be done.  As President, I pledged to work with both parties for the good of the whole nation.  And that's what it is.  It's for the good of the whole nation.  And it's something that is so important to me in terms of this and lots of other things.  And it's happening.  Slowly but surely, it's all happening.  The more I met and spoke with those involved in our criminal justice system, the more clear it became that unfair sentencing rules were contributing to the cycle of poverty and crime like really nothing else before.  It was time to fix this broken system, and it's a system of the past, and to improve the lives of so many people.  and you look at the safety and all of the things that are happening now, as a result of the first step, as an example, nonviolent prisoners will have opportunities to participate in vocational training, education, and drug treatment programs.  When they get out of prison, they will be ready to get a job instead of turning back to a life of crime.  Right?  And I'm really thrilled to report that since I signed the First Step Act, more than 16,000 inmates have already enrolled in drug treatment programs.  And my administration intends to fully fund and implement this historic law.  It's happening, and it's happening fast.  And it's a lot for some people to understand.  And as soon as they understand it, they say, wow, why didn't we do this a long time ago?  The First Step Act also ensures that those in prison are placed closer to their families and home communities so they can have that communication that they need, greatly easing their return to society.  It's really important.  And finally, the law rolls back provisions of the 1994 Clinton crime law that was so devastating to so many and that disproportionately impacted the African American community.  Nobody believes how much, and now they understand it.  In less than four months, more than 500 people with unfair sentences have been released from prison and are free to begin a new life. ",

It gives judges more leeway to deviate from mandatory minimum sentences if they so wish.  So overall, just a great win for criminal justice reform.
