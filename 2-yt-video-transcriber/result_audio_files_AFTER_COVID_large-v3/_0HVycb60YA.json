            "text": "David Morgan with you in the backyard.  You can see a little bit of forest behind me.  It is April 9th, 2020.  And I was thinking of doing this every quarter, every half year, regardless, this is the second one I've done from this location.  And I just wanted to say, I told you so, and I'm really trying to be a bit humorous, but myself and many, many others have forecast an economic collapse, crisis, reset.  You can use whatever word you want, but folks, it's here.  It's happened, it's happening, and it's going to continue.  A trend in motion continues until it actually stops.  the trend is that things have changed on a global basis the supply chain the businesses uh people's personal safety.  lots of things have changed.  all of you are aware of it to one degree or another and a job of mine and many others it's kind of forecast to put a perspective on what's happening now and what it could look like in the near term to long-term future.  and the real answer to that is no one really knows.  but I can say emphatically that things have changed.  and yes, we were forecasting that this Fiat Ponzi scheme cannot go forever.  And we're at a point that I've talked about in other interviews called the backside of the power curve, which is a metaphor for when you stall an airplane, you might have a lot of power in reserve and you put all the power firewall.  This is the expression, give it all the power that you have, which could be a lot, but yet you cannot get the airplane out of a stall condition.  So we are stalled in the economy and it doesn't matter how much money governments, particularly the Federal Reserve, throws at the problem, it's not going to solve the problem.  We have stalled, which means that we are going to see a contraction that I've been talking about in the weekly perspectives.  that I do for free for everybody once a week, except it's going to be much quicker, more dynamic, and touch almost everything that you're familiar with, from the food chain to entertainment to everything.  So I don't want to belabor the point too much, but the main idea I want to get across is just a few.  One is you must be mentally prepared for what's going to take place in the future.  The new normal is going to be substantially different in almost all cases.  Get used to living on less.  Get used to having less availability of entertainment, food products, vacation trips, you name it.  Anything that you thought of doing over the last few years or maybe have participated in will have changed.  Second point is that people can adapt rather easily.  They don't like change.  We like the status quo.  We like things to generally get better for us.  In other words, get more return for less effort or be able to maximize the amount of effort that we do and produce more.  That again has changed.  You are going to be more self-reliant than you've probably been at any time in your life.  And don't get frustrated.  As long as the internet's still up, and I believe it will be, There's lots of things you can learn very rapidly using the internet on things from changing attire, to how to garden, to how to make a meatloaf, you name it.  There's lots of stuff I could go on and on, but you get the idea.  So that's an opportunity that you didn't see in the Great Depression in the 1930s.  There was a lot more agrarian culture in the United States.  than there is now.  And I forget the number.  I'll just make one up.  But I think it's something.  around 70% was an agrarian background in the Great Depression.  So a lot of families moved on the land with grandma and grandpa or mom and dad.  A lot of families came together, which meant that, you know, two or three generations under one roof.  I think you will see a movement toward that this time again.  You also see a disruption in some of the most important, I guess you could call them investment assets that are available.  Stock market is in a long-term downtrend.  There'll be huge rallies at times, and certainly you could probably swing trade it successfully.  Real estate is going to be reset.  There'll be areas that just basically won't come back for a very long time.  the rental market everything about real estate will change to one degree or another.  i can't forecast sitting here today exactly what it's going to look like but be prepared that it has changed.  on the agriculture side i'm pretty much concerned about that.  on a global scale there's been a lot of disruptions not only in the supply of how to get food from one place to another but also what the growing uh situation is not only in like the uh major valleys of the United States, water shortages, planting seasons that have been disrupted, climate change that has disrupted the availability of when you can harvest.  So there's a lot of factors coming together that are going to make food cost more in the immediate future and into the, I would say, distant future, but over the next few years.  So that's one area that will cause kind of what's called by economists, I don't agree with the, the basis of it, but it's called cost push inflation, which means when you go to the grocery store and bread's up 20% in three months, you're going to notice that.  You're going to notice canned foods, just about everything that you are used to buying at basically a subsidized price, you will see at a higher cost level or cost basis for lots of reasons.  And primarily it's going to be less supply and equal or greater demand, which means a higher price.  So those are really the outlines that I think are important to know on a general scale.  More specifically, I'll start talking the metals.  I've already said, well, before I start on the metals, let me just move back to the bond market.  I haven't addressed.  I have said for years and maintain that the bond market is the keys of the kingdom.  The debt markets or credit markets, depending on which side you're on, if you're loaning money or you're borrowing money, holds the key to how the whole economy is put together.  And it is bubble gum and bailing wire at this point.  As I said earlier, as the Federal Reserve tries their best to firewall the throttle and get out of the stall, it's not working.  And it's apparent to almost everybody.  before making this video, I just saw a joke and it showed the federal reserve board chairman, not chairman, but a federal reserve board member coming to the door of a residential average house, knocking on the door and a little boy answers the door.  And he says, I'm from the federal reserve.  And today we are buying baseball cards.  And that's kind of the absurdity of what the fed did in 2008, buying absolutely worthless or next to worthless mortgages at basically par and giving something as sank or sank at the time as T-bills for them in exchange.  So the Fed's balance sheet is increasing.  They're not buying assets.  They're buying assets that aren't worth very much, if anything.  Anyway, the point is, as the bond market starts to crater, and I believe it will, and I don't think it's that far off, that's when really the game's over.  As far as I'm concerned, the game has been over for some time, but it's not been manifest in a manner that the average American knows it.  All they know is that prices are going up on food.  Gas prices are coming down.  Uh, the job market is really horrendous, but, uh, you know, I've got this certain situation or whatever their personal case may be.  I won't address that.  So now under the metals, gold has been performing this job rather well.  It's gold, the asset gold, the metal, and it has performed, um, Almost exactly as I expected.  I mean, I did say, remember, a bull market will shake off as many people that are bullish as possible.  We had a nice run when the stock market first started to crater.  Gold was going the opposite.  And then it went down because there were a lot of margin calls and other reasons.  So gold fell off.  It almost held the 1550 level, which if it did that, I would give it an A+.  I don't want to get too technical here.  It got down under 1500 very briefly.  Popped right back up and as I came outdoors to do the video, I think it was like 1663.  Silver has underperformed.  It got to a high gold silver ratio of 122, unprecedented in all of recorded history.  It's route 109 today as I'm doing this video.  So it's actually coming down, which means silver has outperformed gold on a percentage basis since that time.  And that's what I expect to see.  I like the confirmation of silver outperforming gold.  And we have seen that again a few times, which means on a day like today where gold is up a percent and a half, silver is up 3%.  So it's actually percentage wise doing twice as good as gold on this day.  Not for the week, not for the month.  I'll get to that.  But I do think that silver is still the most undervalued asset out there.  And then we get into the physical situation with both the metals.  And both are very, very coveted and held tightly at this point in time with very little selling, mostly buying.  And the retail market has put huge spreads, especially on silver, sometimes up to five, ten dollars.  an ounce uh premium over the spot price.  there's been problems in the spot market on the uh large side the commercial side meaning you know the exchanges.  and this is something i'm not going to address right now.  you can look it up on the internet.  i haven't really read enough and talked to enough people to look in the eye and say this is what i think is happening.  what i do know is there are curtailments to timely deliveries.  There are some crazy stuff, in my opinion, going on with, well, we'll just make these 400 ounce contracts and swap these 400 ounce bars to make good delivery on a hundred ounce gold contract.  I mean, I'm not really being that facetious.  It's gotten to be in the land of the bizarre.  So that's about as far as I'd like to go on the public dissertation on how I see the markets.  Again, I guess in summary, it's going to take some real substance on your part.  It's going to take your metal, and it's M-E-T-T-L-E.  You're going to have to kind of toughen up, suck it up, and get real with yourself, your family members, others.  Look, everyone is going to be more stressed than probably they ever have been in a very long time.  So my recommendation is to take that into account for yourself.  So be gentle on yourself.  A lot of stuff is out of your control.  So one thing you can control is your attitude.  So pick a good attitude.  And if you find you have a foul one, pause and start over because you could start your day over any time you determine that you wish to start your day over.  So try to be gentle with yourself and Joe and others.  We're all facing some interesting times ahead.  Second thing is acceptance.  Accept the fact that things have changed and it may not be as bad as it seems.  A lot of that's just in your head.  You're used to seeing, you know, I'll speak for myself.  I'm used to seeing a movie and going out for whatever I want to eat.  at a restaurant every time I finish a morning report.  It's just a habit of mine.  I feel like I've earned it.  I deserve it.  I want to just do some mindless activity.  Usually it's a science fiction movie and usually it's a gourmet burger and that's it.  Not to do my personal life.  That's probably gone.  You know, is my life going to suffer for not having that?  Heck no.  You know, maybe I'll do something more productive with that time.  I used to spend out there entertaining myself.  but this is a new reality.  so the other part if you have a lot of time and i think many people will look at something that you have a desire for or especially a burning desire for something really annoying at you and that's the time to learn a new language study something new reach out to old friends look at things that you maybe said.  geez if i only had the time well maybe you have the time now.  so take that into account.  So I think that's enough of my philosophical bent on the whole situation.  I will try to do more of these, both for the public and for the paid subscribers of the Morgan Report.  I thank you for your attention.  Remember, time is the most precious commodity that we all have.  So don't be bored.  Be productive.  Be easy on yourself and treat others with kindness. ",

            "text": "So David Morgan, again, in the back here.  I just want to go through a couple of things about the Morgan Report that you might consider subscribing, and here's why.  I changed the title of the report from the Silver Investor of the Morgan Report very early on because, although I am very studied in the silver market, I do a lot more than that.  Obviously anyone who's talked to me or visited a conference or even read what I've written, I've looked of course at gold but also all the minerals.  We were first on rare earth elements, we talked about cobalt, the battery metals, lithium, uranium, coal, you name it.  And then I did an energy letter for a year.  for a group in London mostly, and that has come to an end.  So the May report is probably going to be a little more adaptive to the current economic conditions, meaning that we may replace some of the miners with energy companies as an example.  And we may even put a food company in there for a hedge against rising food costs.  So I made it the Morgan Report because I wanted to be able to present my thinking on where the best places to invest.  It doesn't have to be resources only, although that's my expertise and where I'm most familiar doesn't mean we can't find some good opportunities in both the energy sector and probably in, let's say, the agricultural group.  So we may be changing or plan to actually change depending on market conditions.  The other part is timing.  Timing is everything.  Right now, as I'm doing this on the 9th of April 2020, things could change tomorrow as fast as things are changing.  I could make a change as far as what I've just put out for the most recent letter four days ago, which is basically put everything on hold except our speculative picks.  And then I rethought it and did a video update for our paid members that went through actually two, I think, top-tier stocks that are really shouting to be purchased right now.  So I'm going to do that on the mid-tier here within the next week or so.  And then, depending on market conditions, we'll get back in or stay aside.  I still think we're probably going to have an opportunity to buy most of these at a lower price, but that remains to be determined.  So you do get a bit of look over my shoulder opportunities whenever I take a look at the markets at large and our specific recommendations.  So it's not for everybody.  We're lower priced than a lot of our competitors.  You have access to us through our membership only site to ask two questions per month.  I'm kind of getting flooded with those.  We may have to cut that off in the future, but right now it's open.  and you will see pretty much a Wall Street quality report on our stock picks, our company updates, the editorials, and the letters to the editor.  And again, we also back that all up with specific videos on general market trends like the strength of the dollar, if I want to short the bond market, if i think it's a good time to leverage in the silver market buy sell hold situations and sometimes just general updates on a company that we featured in the morgan report.  so you get a lot for your money.  it's fifty dollars a month which is uh again at the lower end of the scale for most of our competition.  so if you are an active investor someone that's already got a stock portfolio, someone that has been in the gold sector before, it's probably a good fit.  If you're a brand new newbie, you've never had a stock account, you don't know how to place an order, this is not the report for you.  So if you are an active equity investor, you're familiar with stocks in general, that's enough.  If you know a little bit about options and futures, that's a bit of a benefit but not required.  But it's not a beginner's newsletter.  So let me make that clear.  And I hope to see you as a member of the Morgan Report. ",
