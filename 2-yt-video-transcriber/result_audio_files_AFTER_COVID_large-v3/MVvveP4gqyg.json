            "text": "To meet it successfully, there is call for not so much the emotional and transitory sacrifices of crisis, but rather those which enable us to carry forward steadily, surely, and without complaint, the burdens of a prolonged and complex struggle with liberty at stake.  Only thus shall we remain, despite every provocation, on our charted course toward permanent peace and human betterment.  crises there will continue to be.  In meeting them, whether foreign or domestic, great or small, there is a recurring temptation to feel that some spectacular and costly action could become the miraculous solution to all current difficulties.  A huge increase in newer elements of our defenses, development of unrealistic programs to cure every ill in agriculture, a dramatic expansion in basic and applied research.  These and many other possibilities, each possibly promising in itself, may be suggested as the only way to the road we wish to travel.  But each proposal must be weighed in the light of a broader consideration, the need to maintain balance in and among national programs.  Balance between the private and the public economy Balance between the cost and hoped-for advantages.  Balance between the clearly necessary and the comfortably desirable.  Balance between our essential requirements as a nation and the duties imposed by the nation upon the individual.  Balance between actions of the moment and the national welfare of the future.  Good judgment seeks balance and progress.  Lack of it eventually finds imbalance and frustration.  The record of many decades stands as proof that our people and their government have, in the main, understood these truths and have responded to them well in the face of threat and stress.  But threats, new in kind or degree, constantly arise.  Of these, I mention two only.  A vital element in keeping the peace is our military establishment.  Our arms must be mighty, ready for instant action, so that no potential aggressor may be tempted to risk his own destruction.  Our military organization today bears little relation to that known of any of my predecessors in peacetime, or indeed by the fighting men of World War II or Korea.  Until the latest of our world conflicts the United States had no armaments industry.  American makers of plowshares could, with time and as required, make swords as well.  But we can no longer risk emergency improvisation of national defense.  We have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry of vast proportions.  How to do this?  Three and a half million men and women are directly engaged in the defense establishment.  We annually spend on military security alone more than the net income of all United States corporations.  Now this conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American experience.  The total influence, economic, political, even spiritual, is felt in every city, every statehouse, every office of the federal government.  We recognize the imperative need for this development, yet we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications.  Our toil, resources, and livelihood are all involved.  So is the very structure of our society.  In the councils of government, We must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.  The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.  We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes.  We should take nothing for granted, only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals, so that security and liberty may prosper together.
