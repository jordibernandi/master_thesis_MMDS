Nicholas Lombardi says, nothing.  I was let go.  My phone died.  So, at the most unopportune time, when Lassie's going around the car, we're waiting for her to scratch or not, then jump in the window, and then... It seems like he didn't even get a DUI test.  After that, they just let him go.  And you could see those cops, he had them spun all around.  He literally made them take the fifth, each and every one.  Write in the comment section, what do you think?  I mean, that's a legitimate question.  Why am I not getting a DUI test instead of searching my car?  It's something that I've never heard before, or I've never seen before, but it makes complete logical sense.  It makes 100% logical sense, and you know that by the fact that it stumped each and every cop.  So, write in the comment section what you think.  Does that make logical sense?  What did you see in this video that I might not have saw?  Write in the comment section.  And I'm sorry I haven't been around for a while. ",
