            "text": "Hey, what's up guys?  So I just kind of wanted to take a couple minutes, get everybody caught up to speed on what's going on in my life.  I've been getting a lot of questions and figured I'd just make a second video and answer some of the things that I've been receiving.  I first wanted to say I'm humbled by the response that my video got.  It's been viewed millions and millions of times.  People all over the country have been calling me, texting me, sending me emails, comments, and the overwhelming majority of it has been positive.  And so I think that's pretty cool because My whole thought process on making that video was trying to bridge the gap between law enforcement and the public.  And I've seen both sides with open arms willing to embrace that.  And I think that's a step in the right direction.  So that's pretty cool.  One thing that I've seen come up over and over in the comments and emails sent to me is, are you gonna get in trouble?  What happened to you?  Or is there any discipline taking place?  And so I figured I'd take a chance and give you a little synopsis of the last three days of my life after posting that video.  So I posted the video on Tuesday, was it May 5th?  And it, Took pretty, you know, it took a day or two before it really started getting a lot of traction.  But the next morning when I woke up on the sixth, it was only, I think it was only at a few thousand views.  And I had received a message from my command saying, wow, Greg, what a powerful message.  We agree with that 100%, well done.  And that was actually a relief for me, because I was like, great, I know that it's risky putting something out like that, but I felt like it was so grounded in integrity and liberty that no one would have an issue with it.  So that was a relief.  And then fast forward three hours later, I get another phone call from my command, and it said, hey, hey Greg, the video's up to 400,000 views, it's time to pull the plug on this thing.  I immediately it kind of caught me off guard because I said why would why would we want to pull the plug on something?  that was already acknowledged as a good and powerful message from one law enforcement officer to others and I Said yeah, that doesn't really make sense to me.  I think I maybe we should embrace this message and we should share this with other officers.  And he said, listen, you know, it's not up to me.  I have been directed to tell you to take the video down and I need to know if you're gonna take the video down.  And I said, no, I can't take the video down because if you listen to my first video, The whole message that I was trying to share with people and impart on them is if you believe in something in your heart, you have to stand by that conviction, even if it costs you everything.  And like I said last time, I have three little kids, I have this house, I have another house, I cannot afford to lose my job.  But after putting that message out there and sharing that with America, and it was so well received, can't then just say even though that's what I believe I'm gonna take a step back I'm gonna retract my words and I'm gonna allow my command to prevent me from sharing my heart and my truth.  and I said so with that.  with that in mind sir I can't take the video down and you know I didn't know where this was gonna go and I immediately started thinking about what are they going to try and gig me on?  You know, what did I do wrong?  What policy did I violate?  And uh, I got called back a couple hours later and by this time it was skyrocketing.  Everyone in the agency was seeing it.  Cops from when I was a, an officer down in Los Angeles, they were contacting me.  I got a call and I said, listen, the video needs to be taken down right now and you need to accept a letter of reprimand or We're going to take a very different approach to this if you say no  again.\".  Well, I'd already put myself on that hill and I had to be willing to die on that hill.  They said they determined the video was a violation of policy and that if I wouldn't take it down, that allegations would be made against me and so on and so on.  I told them, no, I'm not gonna take it down.  You do what you need to do, but the principle of it is rooted in truth, and it was a positive message that was received by millions and millions of people.  If you want me to take it down, I have to respectfully refuse.  And it was interesting because they kept citing different policies, you know, like, oh, it was the social media policy, or some of your equipment may have been identifiable, And that kind of seemed like a moot point to me and it was strange because why was the message okay at 5 a.m.  and then three hours later there was a problem with it?
