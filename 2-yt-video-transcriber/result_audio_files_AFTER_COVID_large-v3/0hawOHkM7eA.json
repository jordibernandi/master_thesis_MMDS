            "text": "All right, everybody, Terrence Popp here with another episode live from the lair.  Ah, and this particular episode has been a long time coming.  I have received many, many requests to start throwing some in Emma Watson's face, and it's about time it happened.  Now, for those of you who don't know who Emma Watson is, she is the female star of from Harry Potter.  I don't remember her character's name.  I really don't care.  My kids love that show.  I watched it.  I thought it was okay, but it is what it is.  But, you know, she is, for all intents and purposes, 30 now.  Holy sh**.  She got the role at the age of 9 in 1999-2000.  And, you know, that movie blew up and it was off to the races for her.  Alright, so, apparently, a while back, she gave some speech.  The he for she bullsh**.  that I watched and I was pretty aggravated because she's basically in her speech, I think she gave it at the UN, I don't remember who it was for, I just saw it on YouTube.  She's asking for men's help to help women achieve equality.  But what if our experience of university shows us that women don't belong in leadership?  What if it shows us that yes, women can study, but they shouldn't need a seminar.  What you just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard.  Let me get this straight.  Okay, so men and women are the same and any differences are a social construct.  Okay, and men and women are equal.  Alright, so... Here's an exercise in equality for you, woman.  You want equality?  Then go and take it.  And shut up.  And stop begging for help.  God damn, it's bullshit.  All right, now I got to ask a few questions.  You know, when she did this whole he for she thing, you know, who the hell is she?  to give advice or be a role model to anyone?  because historically actors deal in lies and pretend as a trade.  So when you're talking to an actor, You don't know what you're getting.  You don't know if they're acting, pretending, lying, or they're being honest and forthright.  You can't tell.  All right, so why on earth would you look to somebody like that to give you life advice or be a mentor or role model or any of that?  I don't get it.  But hey, what do I know?  I'm just an old infantry grunt, you know?  Okay.  All right.  Now, historically, if you look at child stars when they become adults, not all of them, but most of them are human beings.  I don't know if they socialize properly or if there's certain gates and things they have to go through as children to reach the pinnacle of being a decent human being and a constructive person of the civilization.  I don't know what it is, but a lot of them have... You know, they're great child stars, then they become adults, they hooked on dope, and they become sexual predators, or they play the victim card to no end, and they're just worthless pieces of shit that just have a lot of money because they earned the money when they were children.  Instant icon, as a rule, equals instant asshole.  You are not the daughter of a god.  And you're not a superhero.  You don't have an iron suit.  You're 120 pounds soaking wet.  You're not some Mary Sue in a film.  You want to kick my ass?  I'm right here.  Kick my ass.  You don't have any guts?  No.  I do have a couple of grenades, though.  Wait, what?  Oh, I've been a rebel.  Are those for real?  What the hell would I be walking around with fake grenades for?  Miss Cortez, do you believe in destiny?  I got a taste for it.  I got a... Okay, now these are her words when they talk to her.  I think she did an interview about a year ago.  She came up with the words.  She doesn't like the word single, and she wants to use the word self-partnered.  Well, where else have we heard that before?  Let me think.  Oh, that's right.  It reminds me of self-marriage.  All right, now dudes, for the most part, are pretty much cool doing their own thing.  I don't know why that is, But most of the dudes I know, they can take it or leave it.  They do their own thing.  Sure, it's nice to have a bunch of friends around and shit like that, but if they're not, you just do other stuff.  So I really don't know what's going on in the brain pan of this woman to use the self-partnering thing.  I'm going to talk about this more in the second board, but we'll leave it for right now.  Alright, now another thing.  she just said in another article that somebody sent me a couple days ago.  She says relationships are impossible.  Okay, well let's look at some factors, you know, of why they're impossible and she's giving up.  Could it have anything to do with the fact that she's on video, you know, basically performing sex acts and sex?  Well, typically... If you are on video doing that kind of thing, there's a word for that.  What is it?  Oh, porn.  Now, I don't know if she was specifically paid for that or what have you.  I talked to my producer about it, and he said it might be a deep fake.  I did a Google search, a Bing search, used the Brave browser.  I looked for anything I could find saying that it was not her, it was a deep fake.  I couldn't find it.  So I'm going to have to go with A. You know, that really happened.  And vada voom, vada ving.  You can go see the chick from Harry Potter doing stuff.  Just saying.  Alright, now typically, as a rule, if you're with a woman and she's involved in the sex industry in any way, shape, or form, past, present, future, what have you, they're temporary or practice.  So with that mindset, is it any surprise to her that there aren't a lot of guys stepping up to, you know, Take the game ball home.  Just saying.  You know, her time in Hollywood and all of the other bullshit.  You know, I would venture to guess that her stacking platform has probably attained suborbital status.  You need to have some serious... serious airbrakes and parachutes to even survive that fall.  Now, are we shocked here that there's a shortage of dudes willing to sign up for that on a permanent basis?  You know, if you start dating her, the dude's name is going to wind up in the papers.  His buddy's going, hey, you know, let's go check her out on Pornhub.  Boom, you're looking at that going, oh God, it's a disqualifier.  I'm sorry, but it is.  So what is her answer to all of this?  She's given up on relationship and she's going into kink.  Okay, because, you know, that's going to take her down to the road of happiness and have, you know, long, sustaining, fulfilling relationships.  You know, but hey, they're good at communicating.  I read that article.  But, you know, whatever.  So basically, she's going full Gwyneth Paltrow, and what's next for her?  Is she going to sell a candle that smells like her vagina?  Come on.  This is just going nowhere good.  We're going to move on to the second board.  Alright, board number two.  Take two.  First one fucked up.  Alright.  second board here.  if you see up here I got the ages 18 to 44 ish women enjoy their first fertility window between the ages of 18 and 28. there is no goalie in the net.  both defensemen are pulling majors in the penalty box and it's a five on three game.  anyone can slip one by the goalie.  just that easy.  Now I talk about these fertility windows and middle age mileage one, middle age mileage two, challenge accepted and fun with numbers.  Okay, now this Emma Watson falls just to the right of the end of her first fertility window, which I believe she's 29, 30 years old.  Might as well put her at 30, whatever.  What does this mean for her?  Well, she's now in infertility window number two, which goes roughly to 38.  And once you get north, the 28-year eggs are drying up relatively quickly where most women can't have children beyond the age of 36.  And they usually stop, you know, you're pretty much done at 38.  The third fertility window takes place after 38 and it is almost always medically assisted.  So it is what it is.  Now, right here at 38, well it starts about 36 to 38, a lot of these women like to freeze their eggs.  And, you know, they think that's going to save them.  And granted, it might buy them some time for the eggs, but they forget the tobacco purse that they're carrying down there is getting oldie, moldy, and dusty, and it's probably not going to work right.  Now, that's just Mother Nature.  That's not me.  I'm just calling out the facts.  All right.  Now, one of the things I've seen over and over again with women, especially, you know, since you can see this play out over and over again in the women's lives since 1960 is while they're young.  and they have a lot of value.  you know feminism loves having these women as spokesmen but as they get older and you know they lose their value feminism you know is going to use them up cast them aside like they don't even care about that which they don't.  they really don't.  now Mrs.  Watson, you know, she's got her money to last her probably four or five lifetimes, even if she gets divorced twice or what have you.  She's never going to be out of cash.  She's enjoyed a high level of success starting at the age of nine years old.  So with all of this, you know, what has it done for her?  It's done nothing for her.  Okay, this is really a horrible example of... you know, for her in regards to this fact that she has all this going for her.  She's fairly attractive.  And, you know, she's given up on relationships.  And, you know, it's a done deal for the most part.  Maybe somebody will care.  She'll throw a Hail Mary and somebody will catch the pass, you know, and then make it into the end zone only to get divorced five to seven years later.  You know, just saying.  Now, these are her own words here that she's experiencing a high amount of anxiety as she approached 30.  Why is that?  Why is she having all this anxiety?  Okay, so that was a Freudian slip here.  30 is not the new 20.  It's more like the 80, but that's just a joke.  All right, now she says in her interview that there's a lot of subliminal messages that by this time in a woman's life, they should be married, be in a stable relationship, and be in a good place in their lives.  Maybe it's not subliminal suggestions.  Maybe it has something to do with a biological clock which causes baby rabies right around 28 to 33.  It's like clockwork for a lot of these women when... You know, they don't have kids.  They get north of 25.  They start feeling the gong, going crazy.  By the time they're 28, they just want to have a kid or two.  It's programming.  It's just the way it is.  And it's causing a high amount of anxiety.  And I hear this all the time, you know, women look younger and, you know, 30 is the new 20 and 40 is the new 30.  No, it's not.  You might look good on the outside, but 30 is 30.  It's not 20.  You're drying up so fast, it sounds like Rice Krispies and milk to me.  I'm just saying.  It's biology, it's not me.  Things are going south for... I just don't see a good outcome.  There's a lot of women out there that are going through this craziness, and I don't see a good outcome.  It's going to end tragically, I believe.  I could be wrong, but what do I know?  20 years from now, she's going to be 50, selling candles that smell like her vagina, or incense that smells like her armpits.  I don't even know, but... That is not a good place to be.  I'm just saying.  Obviously, she's a talented actress.  She'll probably enjoy a significant amount of fame moving forward in her life.  But at the end of the day, that is a career.  There's a lot of women out there who have reached the age of 50, 60 years old who look back and regret this shit.  out of not having children, getting married, and building a stable platform for their older years.  Okay, because guess what?  40 to 80 is a long, long time.  And a lot of these women, they made their bed.  They should probably sleep in it.  Well, gentlemen, that's me.  Hopefully this takes holding the video card, and see you later. ",
