            "text": "three and I heard a great voice out of heaven.  so there's a voice that comes out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of God is with men.  behold.  that means lo and behold so to speak.  right light.  look the tabernacle of God.  see that is with men because remember verse the previous verse 2 it's coming down out of heaven.  it's coming down out of heaven and Like landing on the earth, so then the tabernacle of God right here is now with men.  See that?  So now mankind is with God.  Now notice this is the tabernacle of God is with men, but if you keep reading down at verse 22, there's no temple.  See that?  So verse 22 says there's no temple, but the Bible says the tabernacle is with men.  The idea is this.  that it's within it over here.  see within it there's no temple in here.  God considers this old thing his tabernacle.  that's the idea.  here's another example didn't you know?  if you go to 2nd Corinthians chapter 5 our body is considered to be the tabernacle of God.  See, that's the idea.  Some people think a tabernacle has to be some kind of Jewish-style temple.  That's not what it is.  Tabernacle, it can refer to basically the residence, God's residence.  That's it.  That's the idea.  God's residence is now with us.  Now we live over here.  That's the idea.  But there is no Jewish-style temple in there.  That's the idea.  when you look at later verses.  However, you do notice other verses where it talks about a Jewish temple where Jews will have.  The answer is simple.  The Jews have the what?  The earth.  But not this one.  See that?  That's the idea.  That's why there's no temple here.  But over here, sure there is.  That's the idea.  All right, let's go back.  All right.  The tabernacle of God is with men.  Now mankind... has access to God, and He will dwell with them.  So God's going to dwell with mankind, and they shall be His people.  Mankind will be His people.  Why?  All the unbelievers are cast out.  So anyone throughout all the universe are now God's children.  That's a blessing.  Man, imagine just the person next to you when you go to a coffee shop, and then Starbucks will be illegal in God's eyes because of all the crimes that they committed.  So then God will give it a different name, you know?  Maybe Great Awakening Cafe, right?  Or something like that, yeah.  So then your Great Awakening Cafe, imagine just the customer right next to you, that's a child of God you're standing next to.  And not some kind of transgendered freak, okay?  I mean, like, when you're around people, it's like now you're being cautious, right?  But imagine, like, you're bold about talking about Jesus with the person standing next to you.  Everyone is a child of God.  Everywhere you walk around.  What an eternity, right?  All right.  Yeah, we'll be nice.  All right, let's keep reading over here.  And God himself shall be with them.  God's going to be with them.  It's not just God's child standing next to you at a coffee shop.  Imagine Jesus Christ.  That'll be something, right?  That'll be something.  Amen.  And be their God.  God will be the only person worshipped.  Not some kind of ecumenical circus sideshow with all these different religions in front of the White House and pray to your God.  We're all praying to the same God.  No, they're all different.  Imagine Arab people, Jewish people, Italian people from Rome, Roman people, all worshipping the same God.  That's going to be something.  All right.  And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.  So this is one of the favorite verses in the Bible.  Every tear that you shed, when God wipes away, it's gone.  Now notice this shows that he has to wipe away tears.  Did you notice that there?  So if he wipes away tears, how can he wipe away tears if there's no tear shed?  Now did you notice that?  How can God wipe away the tears if there are no tears shed?  So there has to be some tears shed right before, right before verse 4, there has to be tears shed for God to wipe it away.  Can you guess why there's going to be tears shed if you look at the previous chapter?  Right here.  Because you're a jury condemning your loved one to eternity at the lake of fire.  And there's so much guilt.  Tears.  God will point out the neighbor that you lived next to all that time, the people that you came across all that time, the people in your work, people that you could have passed out a tract to, some homeless person that you just ignored and then that could have gotten the gospel, or the person who just mocked at your face, that person you could have given the gospel to, those tears are going to be shed and you're going to condemn them guilty.  So, I mean, look, no one wants to see a loved one burn in hell for eternity, especially if you're married to that person or if you're living with that person or if that's your mom and dad, if that's a close family member or your best friend.  So then that's why you're going to shed tears.  So then Revelation 20 is a nightmare.  You see that.  Revelation 20 is a nightmare, but Revelation 21, God, he wipes all these tears away.  See, so all these tears are gone that you shed.  So you will shed tears, but then God will make sure that it will be gone for eternity.  So then, I mean, how can I live for eternity while my loved one is burning in hell?  It's because the Lord will wipe it away.  That's the idea.  Keep reading over here.  And there shall be no more death.  See, no more death.  Remember, because the last enemy that's defeated is death.  We read that in Revelation 20, 14.  Neither sorrow.  See, you won't feel sorrow.  Nor crying.  You're not going to be crying.  Neither shall there be any more pain.  All that pain you felt mentally, physically.  You won't know what it's like anymore.  It's gone.  Here's the key.  For the what?  Former things are passed away.  See, all the things that we lived before is gone, passed away, because, verse 5 says, I make all things new.  It's going to be new.  That's the idea.  Okay, tears, death, pain, all of that is considered.  what category?  New or former?  Former, right?  So if all these things are former, literally, it means it's gone.  See that?  So all of this is gone.  And then God says all of this right here is what?  New.  I mean, look at this.  This is all new over here.  New.  This is new.  New.  This is new.  Everything is new.  So then some people bring up the question is that, will we have memories of what we lived our lives on earth?  I know that I'm going to have memories of my lost loved ones, for example.  So how am I going to live happily ever after with those memories?  The idea is this.  In that verse, it never says memories.  The key thing to concentrate on is everything that we live in now, the former, is gone, and God makes everything new.  That's the idea.  So then, all the things that we had in our former life, Pain, sorrow, crying, all of that is gone because we're living in a brand new life.  So will memories be gone?  Will it be wiped out, replaced with the new memory?  I don't know about that, but that's not what the verse is focusing on.  The verse is focusing on all the native things in the former life.  is gone.  It's as simple as that.  So the negative memories, for example, you have about your loved ones and family members, all that sorrow, pain, it's gone.  That's the idea.  About happy memories you have here on earth, you might have it.  I don't know.  But the key to focus on to answer your question is basically negative things in.  the former is gone.  That's the key.  Because the context, look at the context.  Context in verse 4 is all those negative things.  And God calls that former at verse 4.  That's the idea.  Okay?  Alright, now let's look at verse 5.  Verse 5.  How you get an understanding is you just simply read it as it says.  That's it.  That's it.  You don't have to make it complicated and go deeper.  That's the idea.  That's the Lord to figure it out.  We'll get it when we get up there.  We'll get it when we get up there.  All right.  Verse 5.  And he that sat upon the throne.  So we know who that is.  That is God.  God sitting on the throne.  He says what?  Behold.  All right.  So he's trying to say, here ye, here ye.  Right?  That's the idea.  Behold.  Look up.  I make all things new.  So everything is new because he got all of creation brand new.  Everything.  And he said unto me, write.  So God's telling John to write.  Write what?  For these words, bless God, everything that, all the words that you read in Revelation are what?  True and faithful.  They're true.  And they're what?  Faithful.  So it's true.  It will never change.  Faithful because God's not going to change his mind about it.  It's faithful.  It will come to pass.  It's a guarantee.  So this is a guarantee.  What if God takes it back?  What if God changes his mind?  No, it's true and faithful.  So he's not going to go back on it.  So this is what John is writing about.  Can you imagine John writing it out?  Man, just writing with passion, with glee.  He can't wait to send it off to those seven churches over there.  Imagine.  verse 6 and he said unto me God is speaking to John.  it is done.  so God says it is done.  those are the okay.  so I just want to say this I preached a sermon a long time ago.  I called it three finales of God.  the first one basically that we love to hear is concerning our salvation.  this word it is finished.  that is what we're excited about.  why?  because Christ completed the redemptive work for us and we get salvation through him.  the second one was found at the book of Psalms.  it is past it is past and David talks about the beauty of forgiveness in his present walk and fellowship with God and we can claim that we can spiritualize that passage to our Christian walk and our fellowship.  the third one which we're all waiting for.  see we got this when we got saved past right.  we have this now present in our christian walk.  we are waiting for this one future.  it is done and that is what god makes all things new all of future in heaven.  What a time, man.  What a time.  Dr.  Ruckman mentioned there are two endings in the book of Revelation.  The first one you'll notice is at verse 6, it is done.  The second time that he mentions the finale and the ending is verse 13 through 21 of chapter 22.  If you look at chapter 22, verses 13 through 21.  You'll notice as you just skim through that real briefly that that's the second time that he ends it.  So there are two endings here.  All right.  I've given you three finales that basically you can devotionally apply.  We have our past and our salvation, presently in our walk with Christ, and then in the future.  So whenever you get discouraged, you might as well look at these three a little bit.  Think about these three a little bit.  All right.  Let's go back over here.  It is done.  Verse 6.  So God declares himself what?  Alpha and Omega.  Now remember at Revelation chapter 1 I taught you what that is.  That's the first letter of the Greek alphabet to the last letter of the Greek alphabet over there.  Jesus says I am Alpha and Omega.  Why would he declare himself the very first word all the way to the last letter?  It's because John chapter 1 verse 1, Jesus is the word.  In the beginning was the word.  The word was with God.  The word was God.  So because he is the word, that's why the last letter to, the first letter all the way to the last, that's Jesus Christ over there.  He claims it to himself.  Now, I'm not saying that the Bible is Jesus Christ, but you'll notice how he closely assimilates himself with that.  So every word counts.  So when you touch that book and you mess with it, shouldn't you have a guilty, scary conscience about it?  They say that we worship the King James Bible more than Jesus Christ.  You better shut your mouth, you stinking, bald-headed, bearded Calvinist drinking beer and probably smoking marijuana if you had the chance to.  These bunch of wicked people, they're pretty much God haters, let's say.  I mean, if you hate his word, then you hate the Lord himself.  Oh, you just said Jesus is the Bible.  You just said it.  I'm going to edit that, clip that, and post it online.  You demonic liar.  You always lied about the Bible.  You might as well lie about the preacher.  Stinking devils over there.  I mean, if you look at the entire Bible, Jesus may not declare himself to be the Bible itself, but he connects that word to him.  He assimilates that thing closely with him.  I mean, that's the thing over there.  This bunch of wicked, demon-possessed people.  If Jesus Christ puts himself in that much of a close relationship with it, then you better be careful when you touch that book.  You better be careful.  I mean, if you keep reading that chapter 22, he took it seriously about adding, subtracting his words, didn't he?  All righty.  That's the meanest thing I'll ever say in today's lesson.  All right?  All right.  Yeah, amen.  Bless God, sister.  All right. ",
