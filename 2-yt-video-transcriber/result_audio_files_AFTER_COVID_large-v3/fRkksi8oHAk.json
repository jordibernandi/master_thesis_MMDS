            "text": "Hey everyone, I'm Diana Davison, advocate for the falsely accused and wrongfully convicted.  Now I know, probably like me, most of you have become sick to death of these massive MeToo allegations that have been taking place online since October of 2017 when that movement started.  I'm as mad as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore!  But I want to talk today because we're going on three years now.  You'd think that journalists would be getting better at doing this when they actually report on these allegations.  But in this case, it's got to be the worst example I've seen of a lack of due diligence in terms of the journalist fact checking thing.  So I'm going to get into.  I'm going to show you bits of this article and I'll give you a link to it so you can go check it out.  And I've been actually contacting a few people.  The author of the article, I haven't contacted the editors yet, but I asked a bunch of questions, requests for comment.  I have not heard back from the author.  I also requested some information and made an inquiry with a lawyer that they're quoting in here.  So I'll explain what's going on.  Here we go.  The article is called York University facing criticism for not doing enough to help victims of sexual assault.  And this is published on a site called blogto.com which is essentially a tabloid based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.  The article claims thousands of people are calling for the expulsion of a York University student after more than 50 women came forward with sexual assault allegations.  Well, it's true that there is a petition, but I had to question over 50 women because online, where it's being posted on Twitter, the main complainant is posting allegations, some of them anonymous, and there's only actually, from my count at the time of writing this email to the author, there were only actually 18 different complainants that I could identify that had been posted.  Now, in case you think that 18 accusers is still awfully large number well I want you to keep in mind that some of the accusations involve only getting a high five from this individual as the most physical contact that occurred and then the problem was.
