            "text": "Wait, this person is live right now talking about you and name-dropped you multiple times.  Uh-oh.  Hey, by the way, real quick.  Hey, if you guys ever go to other people's chats and harass them on my behalf, you get permabanned on all of my chats.  Just as a heads up in case you guys didn't know that.  You misread the Chud Logic thing on YouTube video.  I could provide a timestamp.  Misread what, VexingCow?  Just say what I misread.  You ignored the part where he acknowledged the fact that she is underage, indicating that she has told him in this screenshot that she is underage.  Oh, this screenshot.  Got awkward much?  Well, it's just inappropriate for me to flirt with someone who is underage or even young, like 18.  It's supposed to be half your age plus 7.  Sorry, I don't know I'm awkward.  Don't be.  Are you awkward about talking to me like this?  If you don't like it, you can say, is cool.  Don't be.  Sorry, awkward.  So, in this screenshot, it's hard to tell what's going on, but it kind of looks like maybe he knows she's 17.  You don't know that from reading this, but it's possible.  But... She cut this off at the most disingenuous point.  LOL, okay, so serious question.  How old are you?  If you don't mind me asking, why do you ask?  I don't know.  I guess it's good to know if we're chatting.  If you don't want to tell me, that's cool.  I'm 33, old boomer.  She says boomer.  Yep, that's me.  I'm legal, so you won't get in trouble if that's what you're wondering.  LOL.  Sorry to ask.  Haha.  That's almost who else.  God awkward much?  Well, it's just inappropriate for me to flirt with someone who's under age or even young like 18.  It's supposed to be half your age plus 7.  Sorry.  I don't know.  Sorry.  I'm awkward.  Don't be?  are you awkward about talking to me like this?  If you don't like it, you can say it's cool.  Don't be sorry This is a scum crop.  This is a scum crop.  also Just something in case you guys don't know because a lot of you we've talked about this a little bit before.  apparently this is Brazilian.  some people's people don't know this.  it is possible that that you can be trapped in like an emotionally abusive relationship where the other person is like gaslighting you and threatening you with their own emotions to make you feel like you have to stick around.  So a good example is like this person tweeting out stuff like, oh my God, like I'm suicidal now, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  If you're with somebody and you wanna leave and they're constantly threatening that they're gonna like kill themselves if you do something, if you talk to somebody, if you leave, if you make a friend or whatever, that is a form of emotional abuse and manipulation actually.  If anybody in these convos is emotionally manipulative or likely to be a groomer, it is this Haley person 1 million percent more than the fucking Chud Logic guy, than the fucking guy who's saying like, oh, yeah, it's inappropriate with me to talk to somebody who's even 18.  And oh, yeah.  Are you awkward about me talking like this?  If you don't like it, you can say, oh, like, how old are you?  Like, I'm 33.  So, you know, right.  This person.  is way less likely to grow up to be a groomer slash pedophile slash abuser slash manipulator than the person here who is lying about their age, threatening to commit suicide because people won't believe their highly disingenuously fucking cropped screenshots, and somebody that's like not giving any indication right now at all that they're uncomfortable with this and then coming out later trying to pretend they were.  Oh, also, Destiny acted like I claimed I survived a nuclear war.  I'll show a screenshot of things that made me uncomfortable to bring to the community's attention.  Also, he misgendered me the whole segment.  I misgendered her because they're using neopronouns of Maumar that they invented themselves.  Fuck outta here.  Did you invent Maumar?  I can't find any information on these words related to neopronouns.  Yes, I did, actually.  Not to mention the fact that in her little location, she even has that she and her is acceptable.  Also, the, like, this stuff.  Like, if you want me to kill myself, you all are doing a good job.  The harassment I've gotten is just as damaging as what CL did.  If I knew what would happen, I probably would have been a coward and not have told my story.  This is how you treat people for coming out.  The people are not going to want to come out.  Good!  If there are people that want to share fake... or people that want to try to destroy people's lives over nothing, yeah, you probably should keep that to yourself.  If you're uncomfortable because you just don't like somebody after engaging in consensual flirting with them for fucking hours and hours or days or weeks or whatever afterwards, then yeah, what the fuck?  Why the fuck would you go public with something like that?  This is damaging on two ends.  Hold on one second.  There's two huge damages that are happening here.  One, you are damaging the person that you're accusing, obviously, which is fucked up.  But then two, and I hate to repeat the meme, you are unironically doing a massive disservice to everybody that actually comes out with these types of accusations.  Like, because now every, because it sucks that, like, when people come out with accusations, these types of things are what come to people's minds.  Like, the past few years, like, hey, like, the Me Too movement produced a lot of credible, like, accusations.  A lot of people like fucking Bill Cosby, Kevin Spacey, like, these were really important.  But then people are like, why aren't there a lot of bullshit accusations?  Like, well, not really.  Well, what about, like, this person?  And this person's like, hmm, okay, fine, fuck.  Not good.  Also, I personally don't feel like it's nothing.  Definitely not warranted with outing like this, but the guy was being kind of creepy despite the amount of outing.  How is he being creepy?  Dude, you are creating MGTOWs.  I hope you guys realize this, that you are creating the MGTOWs and the insults and the black pills and the red pills of the future when every single fucking flirtatious line is creepy.  Like, if you're going to go with this, then girls just need to make every first move and stop expecting guys to do it if every single time we say anything.  It's gonna be considered like creepy or inappropriate.  fuck that shit like.  I'm sorry But half the population is still too much of a fucking coward to even make the first move and anything.  you're gonna accuse guys or men Of being creepy every single time.  they even talk to a fucking girl and then also fuck out of here with the power dynamic.  shit, too.  Every single part of this stinks to high heaven.  is some bullshit power dynamics.  This guy is fucking 6,000 subs on YouTube.  Okay, my kids kindergarten teacher probably had a bigger YouTube channel than this dude.  What the fuck power dynamics are you talking about?  Shut the fuck up.  get out of here with this bullshit.  No offense to chub logic. ",

They're always such a person.  that's like, now I fucking hate Destiny and I wish his whole family would fucking die.  But I agree with him here.  Like, normally Destiny just spews diarrhea shit all day long.  But in this one take, I think I like it.  This person is even worse.  I can forgive the other girl because she, er, mwah.  furry whatever the fuck she goes by they mar goes by.  i'm never.  i'm fucking neo pronouns.  okay um this person i'm not going to run for cover while destiny spans me to the subject of a targeted harassment campaign.  instead i'm going to respond in video form fully explain my side of this and try to do something good for others who have been affected by behavior like this.  if you had uncomfortable experiences with figures on the left and feel safe doing so you can send me messages anonymous or not written or audio and i'll include them in this video to show exactly why we need to address harassment on the left and start holding people accountable.  i'm here for y'all and i'm not gonna bend uh to these assholes.  let's make a difference for the better.  my account is like for the time being so if y'all can spread the word about this video i'll love you forever already.  can somebody give me the screenshots of her conversation with the guy?  this smells like something that is using the toolkit they learned online to garner false support.  i wonder the screenshots are insane.  are the screenshots in your video?  yeah but i don't want to watch myself awkward much.  don't listen to me time.  The screenshots are unreal.  This is a woman, or person, I don't know, sorry, who is 30 years old, 30 years old, saying that they got groomed, okay?  30 years old, saying they got groomed.  And here are their screenshots of the other person being uncomfortable.  Ready?  How dirty are you, really, though?  As in mind, I'm sure you are very pure.  Haha, me, pure?  Funny.  No, I'm a heathen in the eyes of God himself.  I'm sure I could whip you into shape.  I mean, I'm usually the one whipping others into shape.  Or submission.  Depends on my mood, lol.  Damn, well, is that how this is gonna work between us?  It's a clash of the titans.  What happens between- Like, this person is claiming that the other person was being crea- Are you fucking  serious?!  We're, like, fucking flirting with sexting here.  Like, they're almost at that level.  And they're trying to say that the other person was grooming them?  Like, dude, unbelievable.  This is, like, un-fucking-real to me.  Fuck this shit.  These people should be fucking shamed for what they've done.  Like, unreal how disgusting you are to try and come on and acquire some trendy fucking victim status at both the expense of the person you're accusing and other people that... actually have actual real problems that occur with them and other people online that are either trying to groom them or abuse them in other ways.  Like, unreal, dude.  I don't even like, no offense, but I don't even know if I like this person.  I don't even know who this person is.  Somebody said I'm defending my friends.  I don't even remember this person.  I don't remember somebody that uses a fucking avatar to speak online.  I don't know who the fuck this guy is.  Is it possible to groom some people over 18?  Yeah, of course you could.  This person was not groomed.  Or if they were, they were in other messages that haven't been shown. ",

A new personality construct has been defined that describes people who persistently see themselves as victims within interpersonal conflicts.  The research was published in Personality and Individual Differences.  Study authors Rahav Gabay and team describe how the social world is satiated with interpersonal transgressions that are often unpleasant and seemingly unwarranted, such as being interrupted when speaking.  While some people can easily brush off these moments of hurt, others tend to ruminate over them and persistently paint themselves as a victim.  the authors present this feeling of being the victim as a novel personality construct that influences how people make sense of the world around them.  the researchers call it the tendency for interpersonal victimhood which they define as an ongoing feeling that the self is a victim which is generalized across many kinds of relationships Through a series of eight studies among Israeli adults, Gabe and associates sought to test the validity of the construct of TIV and explore the behavioral, cognitive, and emotional consequences of such a personality trait.  An initial three studies established the TIV as a consistent and stable trait that involves four dimensions, moral elitism, a lack of empathy, the need for recognition, and rumination.  A follow-up study further found that this tendency for victimhood is linked to anxious attachment, an attachment-style character.  Oh, Anna would love this.  A follow-up study found that this tendency for victimhood is linked to anxious attachment and detachment-style characters by feeling insecure in one's relationship, suggesting that the personality trait may be rooted in early relationships with caregivers.  Next, two studies offered insight into the cognitive profile of those with TIV.  The studies had participants consider scenarios that involved another person treating them unpleasantly, either by having subjects read a vignette?  I don't remember how to pronounce this. ",

Participants high in TIV also reported experiencing more intense negative emotions and a higher entitlement to immoral behavior.  Mediation analysis offered insight into how this revenge process unfolds.  The higher participants TIV, the more they experienced negative emotions and felt entitled to behave immorally.  However, only the experience of negative emotions predicted behavioral revenge.  Well, I think you're right on these particular victims.  You're devaluing genuine victims by saying it's trendy to be a victim.  Look at the LSF thread.  You got all gambler bros behind you, mate.  What do you think that does to genuine victims who are unsure whether or not they want to speak up?  Well, hopefully it encourages more of these types of fuckers to not do it.  Because, I mean, like, it's a reality that you have to acknowledge.  There is, like, a trendiness right now online of being, like, a victim of something.
