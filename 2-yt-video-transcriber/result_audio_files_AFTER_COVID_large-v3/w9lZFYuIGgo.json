            "text": "When we talk about starvation wages in this country, I was happy to hear that Target has raised its minimum wage for its many, many thousands of workers to $15 an hour.  And that's something that I and many others here have long advocated for.  This follows a decision two years ago by Amazon to raise the minimum wage for their workers to $15 an hour.  and the effort in seven states across this country to raise their minimum wage to $15 an hour.  Now is the time for Walmart, the largest employer in America, owned by the wealthiest family in America, to also raise their minimum wage to $15 an hour.  I should add, Mr.  President, that the Walton family, family that owns Walmart, can more than afford to do this, because since Donald Trump has been president, their wealth has increased by about $75 billion.  Let me repeat, their wealth has increased by about $75 billion in the last three-plus years.  and they're now worth some $200 billion as a family.  You know what?  I think the Walton family can afford to pay their workers $15 an hour.  And by the way, when we talk about racial justice, please understand that about half of black workers in this country earn less than $15 an hour.  Further, Mr.  President, the House has done the right thing.  by passing legislation to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour.  The time is long overdue for the Senate to do the same. ",
