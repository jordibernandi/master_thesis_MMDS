            "text": "G'day guys, how you doing?  It's the Kiwi.  Yes, I'm back with another video.  And in this video, we're going to be talking about the sacrifice.  This is going to be a good one.  And the reason why we're going to talk about it is it really goes hand in hand with the previous video that I did in regards to how you start to incorporate this shadow aspect of yourself with this human aspect of yourself to bring these two worlds kind of meshing together.  And we talked about in that video about how when you really go your own way, like you really pack your bags and get out there and you really... Make a go for it.  Throw a backpack on and you're like, screw it.  I'm done with this job, this relationship, this city or town or the country I'm living in.  And you really go for it.  You're putting yourself at the mercy of the gods.  And I said that in the previous video.  And that's what we're going to be explaining.  Now, the interesting thing is that when you actually do do something like that, you are what we would call self-sacrificing.  yourself.  You're literally self-sacrificing yourself.  And when you look at nature, look at nature all around us, especially me, you know, living in New Zealand, there's a lot of nature around us.  Nature is continually self-sacrificing itself.  And we are a part of nature.  Human beings, contrary to popular belief, we are a part of nature.  And we're, you know, we are a beast.  So when we look at nature and we look at how nature is continually self-sacrificing itself, you know, have these acts of God where an earthquake will happen or a hurricane or a typhoon or something will come in and hit the land.  and completely destroy human population, civilization.  There's always something going on.  It doesn't even have to be that.  It could be a volcano going off in the middle of nowhere and completely flattening hundreds of thousands of acres of forest or natural land.  That's nature self-sacrificing itself.  And what happens when nature self-sacrifices itself?  Nature rebuilds itself.  Nature flourishes.  Nature is continually self-sacrificing itself so it can rebuild itself.  That's the cycle of life.  Now, the interesting thing about that is this is something that the ancients knew about thousands and thousands of years ago.  When you look at the Mayans or the pagans or many of these ancient religions... you know, or ancient civilizations, they would actually have a self-sacrificial ritual where they would sacrifice a human being, say, at the planting of a crop or something along that lines.  And they would always sacrifice that individual for the gods.  It was a sacrificial act to the gods, right?  And that's what Stonehenge is.  Stonehenge is actually a site of sacrificial worship.  They would literally kill a human being at that site.  That's ancient pagan religious beliefs, okay?  Now here's the thing.  There's a specific group of people, and I'm not pointing fingers at anyone, understand this absolutely intrinsically.  it's absolutely mind-blowing and when you look at how humanity gets sacrificed on pretty much a year-to-year basis it's absolutely unbelievable.  when you look at the wars that have happened over hundreds of years These have all been sacrificial acts.  When you look at an economy being crashed, sometimes the economies that are crashed, it's no accident that these events happen.  In all sincerity, they're sacrificial acts.  Look at this whole COVID-19 thing right now where they've locked down countries all over the world.  People have lost their jobs, lost jobs.  lost their homes, lost their finances, lost, lost, lost, lost, lost.  It's a sacrificial act.  And what happens is when you sacrifice at a massive level like that, what happens is nature wants to rebuild itself.  Look at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the two places on the face of the earth where they dropped the A-bombs.  What happened in those two cities?  They rebuilt themselves.  They literally rebuilt themselves from the ground up.  And you've got two magnificent flourishing cities in those regions now.  Regions that were supposedly off limits because of radiation.  They've been completely rebuilt.  That's what nature does.  We're no different to ants.  We are a part of nature.  So once we've been sacrificed... we immediately rebuild.  Look at the sacrificial act that went on in the Ukraine.  The Ukraine lost two generations of men during the Second World War, let alone the roughly, most probably 10 to 20 million Ukrainians that were starved out during the Holodomor famine, during the lead up to the Second World War.  There were millions of people lost their lives in the Ukraine.  You wouldn't think that going now, because after the Second World War, what did the population do?  They started breeding to rebuild their population, and they started to rebuild.  That's because we're a part of nature.  You are a part of nature.  I am a part of nature.  So the key here, the key is to know that your being here is already a sacrificial act.  And that will be a subject for another video.  However, if you're already a sacrificed individual, a sacrificed being here, you do not put yourself in a position to be sacrificed by other individuals.  You need to learn to self-sacrifice.  And that's what going your own way is about.  It's about the self-sacrifice.  And it doesn't matter.  You can be a male or a female.  Going your own way is for both sides of the spectrum.  And by doing that, you are literally self-sacrificing yourself.  Now, when you self-sacrifice yourself, what happens is, like I said in the other video, literally God, nature, creation, whatever is in charge of this whole show goes home.  We've got a brave one here.  Let's see what we can do to help this person on their path to awakening.  Because that's what this is about.  Being here is about awakening to your own consciousness.  Because everything in the entire universe, everything is pure consciousness.  That's the one thing I learned when I died.  When I crossed over and experienced the other side, everything is pure consciousness.  Everything from every blade of grass to every droplet of water to everything.  It is mind-numbing.  So if you decide to really, really go your own way, you decide, you know what, I'm done with this relationship.  done with this job.  I don't want to live with my parents anymore.  I want to make my own way.  I want to learn about who I am.  And you make the ultimate self-sacrifice, which is to throw a bag on your back and head off into the wilderness.  And when I mean the wilderness, I'm not talking about a forest.  I'm talking about just heading away from your comfort zone.  You're self-sacrificing yourself by leaving behind the dogma of the world.  And if you head out, like some of us will actually head off into the wilderness, like literally to a different country or different countries.  And it's incredible what ends up happening because we'll end up going down our paths.  and what have you.  And here's the thing.  Everybody thinks that, oh, if I've sacrificed myself, I'm going to have fame.  and fortune and wealth and riches and all this wonderful feel-good stuff.  It doesn't work that way.  The only way that you can awaken to your own consciousness and learn about yourself, sadly, is through sometimes a lot of pain and a lot of heartache.  So what happens is when you self-sacrifice yourself, and you put yourself out there at literally the mercy of the gods and they go, we've got a brave one.  Let's see if we can help him or her.  What they're going to do is they're going to put these roadblocks in front of you.  They're going to put things that are going to pop up that are going to make you have to self-examine yourself, to have to look at yourself because what we do is we tend to want to go in a direction that we think is the direction that we should be going in.  That the reality of the situation is.  you most probably are meant to be going in this direction.  I've talked about this a lot in other videos, but I've been slowly nurturing you on these subjects.  So what happens is as you're going down your path, you're going to have stuff that's going to come along and either smack you up the side of the head, knock you off your path, cause trauma.  heartache, pain, this stuff happens to awaken us, to bring us to a level of understanding and a level of consciousness inside of ourselves.  Now depending on how hard-headed or pig-headed you are, some of us are pretty hard-headed, you'll get knocked off, I like calling it the hamster wheel of life, you'll get knocked off the hamster wheel of life, dust yourself off and you'll get right back on it.  Now, what will happen is the events that will happen in your life will get higher, bigger, stronger, and more difficult.  You know, first there'll be a slap to your face, and then before you know where you're at, depending on how far down the path you are, it could end up becoming a major kick to your balls.  That's just going to have you buckled up like, Oh, what did I do wrong, man?  That's what happened to me.  So what happens is these events will be extremely traumatic.  They'll be extremely difficult to get through and you need to become aware of them.  It's like, what can I learn from these events?  that are going to bring me around onto my path of understanding myself and awakening to my own consciousness, awakening to who I am as an individual.  So, um, Like for me, a perfect example is as I was going down my path of wanting to become a race car driver or wanting to be involved in racing.  and what have you, I was constantly put in situations where I was always learning a skill set, and my skill set got better and better and better.  So then the next thing that I felt that I should do is start my own business, right?  Now, even though I was starting my own business, I always would have multiple individuals that wanted me to go work for them.  Hey, you can be my personal mechanic.  Hey, you can be my personal car builder.  Hey, I've got a collection of cars.  Could you help me with this stuff?  And I was like, no, no, no, I've got my own business.  I'm going to carry on with that.  So these were people, many, many people that would always chip in my ear about, hey, this is what you should be, you know, could you do this stuff?  And I would ignore it.  Then what would happen is somebody would come along, knock me off my freaking path, and I'd dust myself off and get back up and rolling.  Well, to cut a long story short, you know, After 2014 and really getting a major, major kick in the guts, major kick in the guts.  And by the way, just so you know, I started four businesses in the United States between 1999 and 2014.  So that's 15 years.  I lost all four of them, but I lost them.  This is the interesting part.  I lost them through outside events that I actually had no control over.  I mean, it was mind-blowing how this stuff would play out when I look back on it.  And it's literally whatever is in charge of this stuff coming along.  And these events got bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger to the point, 2014, I can't make this shit up.  October, November, and December, homeless.  Living in my truck, homeless.  And yeah, it was a real, real, that was a real kick to the balls.  But hey, here I am.  So what happens is after those events, I finally ended up going and working for somebody full-time.  And it was a really good gig.  That's where I started the videos, in that little tin shed, you know?  And it was seriously, it was a really, really good gig.  Really, really good gig.  So that's what will happen when you self-sacrifice.  And by the way, by letting go of all this stuff over here and letting go of these ideologies and these beliefs and all this dogma that I was following over here about wanting to have my own business, By letting go of that stuff, I was also self-sacrificing myself again.  This is a process that will happen over and over and over and over again.  You literally have to let, by self-sacrificing yourself, you're letting aspects of yourself die.  You're letting your beliefs, your previous thought of beliefs, ideologies, social dogmas, you're letting that stuff die off.  Learn about who you are, which will in time slowly awaken this consciousness that lives inside of you called your shadow.  And it's about slowly but surely meshing, meshing these aspects of yourself together.  And when you finally get these aspects, and it's not going to happen overnight.  This is a journey.  It took me... I mean, if I wasn't so hard-headed, it most probably would have happened a little bit quicker.  It most probably would have taken maybe five years.  Oh, God.  Because I started my own business in 1999, and by 2005 was really my first offer to be a personal mechanic for an individual and work on his own private collection of cars.  And I turned that down.  And these events just kept on showing up.  And I was just so hard headed.  It was unbelievable.  So it took me 15 years to finally really waken up to what my real true path in life is.  And that's also what helped me actually start this channel.  Because the first job that I had put me in a situation where I was actually able to start these videos.  And that's what This is part of my actual true path in life.  And so that's what I'm doing.  So always realize that any form of self-sacrifice, any form of losing something isn't a bad thing.  Even though you might go through heartache, even though you might go through pain, there's going to be growth.  come out of it.  Because like I said, whatever's in charge of this thing, this is what it wants you to do.  And that is what will bring this aspect of yourself, the shadow, in contact with the physical aspect of yourself.  Because believe it or not, you're already one being.  You're already this one.  You're literally a three-tier being.  You're mind, body, soul.  Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost.  Israel.  Yes, Israel is an ancient teaching of the Trinity.  It is not a physical landmass.  It is not a place of any specific group of people.  It is an ancient teaching of the Trinity, and I will do a video about that here coming soon.  So yeah, the sacrifice, and this is just the start.  There's other aspects to the sacrifice, and we will be talking about that. ",
