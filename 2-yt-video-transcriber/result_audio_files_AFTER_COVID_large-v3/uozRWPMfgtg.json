And that, in my mind, was almost like, you know, it was almost like Trump getting the country back from the doctors, right?  In the sense that what he now did was, you know, he's going to own the open up.  There were three phases.  There was the panic phase, the pain phase, and then the comeback phase.  That doesn't mean there's not still a lot of pain and there won't be pain for a while.  But that basically was we've now put out rules to get back to work.  Trump's now back in charge.  It's not the doctors. ",

Imagine saying we've got to take the airplanes back from the pilots.  All of these checklists and fuel calculations and talking about what do we do if we have to do an emergency?  We got to take control back from these pilots.  We'll cut down the turnaround time by 30 minutes each way and we'll be able to fly an additional flight every single day.  That's essentially what they're saying here.  Let's take the clearing of toilet backups back from the plumbers, my friends.  It's time to get these overconfident idiot plumbers out of here.  That's a phrase Jared Kushner will use in this next clip.  Remember when they said What was it?  We need a businessman running the country like a business.  Well, he saw himself as negotiating with doctors to get more deaths in exchange for some businesses opening.  Take a listen. ",

Because that has a way sometimes of getting past his defense mechanism, because if you're overconfident, Then sometimes, you know, on a topic where he doesn't have other people around to kind of validate it, then he can sometimes say, okay, let's go with that.  So that's kind of, I think if you look at the evolution over time, we've gotten rid of a lot of the over-competent idiots.  And now we've got a lot more thoughtful people who kind of know their place and know what The most dangerous people around Trump are overconfident idiots like Jared, not like the doctors. ",

Very revealing comments from Jared Kushner.  And then this next one is really just stunning.  It's Kushner confirming exactly what I've been saying for years about both Donald Trump and his followers.  It's not about issues.  It's not about policy.  It's about attitude.  It's about pissing people off.  And Kushner says it.  Listen to this. ",

And what Trump's been able to do is, I say he's basically did a full hostile takeover of the Republican Party, and I don't think it's even as much about the issues.  I think it's about the attitudes.

But to hear them say it so overtly is chilling.  Trump claims to be a great businessman.  Jared Kushner, a great businessman.  And yet they don't realize that the way to get the economy back is not to reopen prematurely.  It was always to deal with the pandemic that would naturally fix the economy.  They've never understood it.  And so it just goes on and on.  And now Trump is endlessly repeating, oh, Biden.  wants to lock everything down.  Fauci wants to lock everything down.  Everyone but Trump wants to take away your freedoms.  But the goal isn't to lock down and restrict freedoms.  It's let's unite against the common enemy and deal with the pandemic to save both American lives and to save the economy in the long term.  The economy would naturally recover with the pandemic under control.  And instead, this administration has said, let's get the doctors out of here.  Let's force openings because the focus was, I guess, short term gains, even though I believe it has completely backfired.  Let's see if the election results bear that out.  And, you know, at the tail end of this, if you open too early, you're almost guaranteeing another shutdown.  And even if it's not an official shutdown, it's people who are going to stay home here in Massachusetts as cases have gone from 150 a day to 300, 600, 1200 and now even more.  Things are remaining open because it doesn't seem there's any political willingness to start shutting things down.  But people are staying home more and more because they see the numbers.  And that's the reality.  You can't shortchange actually dealing with the problem and focusing only on haphazardly fixing the symptoms, but it just doesn't work and it's not work.  Then we're seeing it now.  We'll continue discussing this on the show's Instagram at David Pakman show.  And if you're on Instagram, you might as well find me on Instagram at David Pakman. ",
