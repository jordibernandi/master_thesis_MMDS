            "text": "hey guys i just had a very startling dream that made a very strong impression on me so i want to share it even though i can't say that i know for sure what the interpretation is.  but the purpose of sharing it before i know the interpretation is so that it's clearly recorded that this is a dream from the lord and then the meaning will become clear.  as oftentimes it happened to the prophets in the Bible, they would receive something that they didn't fully understand.  By the way, I want to teach something about prophets and prophecy.  A lot of people use that word very loosely, and then they think that a prophet is a fortune teller.  Actually, when I went to Bible school, I was taught something very, very important, that the ministry of the prophet means that the prophet is first and foremost a preacher of the gospel.  If you're not a preacher of the gospel, you ain't no prophet.  A prophet isn't somebody that's just going around telling the future.  Even the prophets in the Bible rarely did that.  They were preaching the good news.  They were preaching how sins can be atoned for by the blood sacrifice.  Whether they were looking forward to the Messiah or looking back to the Messiah, they were prophets because anyone inspired by God, anyone speaking on a regular basis gifted with the gift of prophecy is operating as a prophet or in the prophetic.  There are levels of that.  I understand that.  But people just think that unless you tell the future and you get it right all the time, that's not a prophet.  No.  A prophet is a preacher and a teacher of the Word of God.  Now, I receive a prophetic message.  I receive a dream.  in which I saw a soccer match coming up.  Now, Melbourne is not known for soccer.  It's known for a lot of sports, but it's not known for soccer.  I saw that the Melbourne soccer match was going to happen.  It was going to be a big match.  And a famous soccer player was boasting that he can kick the ball into the goal, no matter how difficult.  And so they suddenly, they put a wall, somebody put a wall in front of the goal.  He said, no, he can still kick the ball over the wall into the goal because he said he has seen the two stones.  I thought, wow, what is that?  And he said, he's seen the two stones and he's seen the two scrolls that are inside the two stones.  So I was very curious and I thought, in the dream, what is that thing?  And I learned you had to go up on top of a building, a high building, to be able to see the whole soccer field and see beyond that wall.  And so I went there and I looked and I still couldn't really make out where these two stones were.  They were supposed to be somewhere aligned to the goal posts and farther away.  So if he knew where these two stones were, he could... get the soccer ball in.  He could kick it in no matter what.  But I was looking and looking and I said, you know, I must not be a soccer player.  I just really don't see where these two stones are.  Suddenly it was shown to me.  Somebody asked me, who showed me?  I don't know.  But it was shown to me one of the scrolls.  And I literally saw one of these Jewish Torah scrolls.  And that scroll was evidently what was inside those two stones.  And so I was assured for sure that this was a real scroll with inside a real stone.  With that, I just went up to the top floor.  I went to the bathroom, nothing really strange, just went to the top floor, nothing special about this bathroom, just an ordinary bathroom, not even luxurious in this building.  And I came out, and then from the top of the building, there were a bunch of people standing, and it was a glass wall, right?  It's like all windows.  And you could see an explosion in the Melbourne CBD.  it was absolutely clear, as clear as I've seen any person standing in front of me, I saw a huge explosion in the Melbourne CBD.  And right away the first thought that came to me was, I was wondering if this was nuclear.  Because if this is nuclear, I might as well just stand there and watch it and die and go to heaven, because there was no way to escape it.  So immediately three questions raced through my mind.  Number one, as soon as I saw this explosion, I was waiting to see if it would mushroom like a nuclear explosion.  And my first question was, is this nuclear?  As I watched it, it looked like it was spreading, but it wasn't mushrooming.  And it turned out to be a series of chain bombs.  That's what I thought in my mind.  It's a series of chain bombs, like somebody, some terrorist had... put a bunch of bombs next to each other so that one would trigger the other and it would keep exploding.  The second question that I had in my mind was, is this the beginning of the end?  Because the people standing on the top floor, they were all frozen, just looking at this scene in shock and in awe.  I said, is this the beginning of the end?  The third question I had in my dream was, how best to get down this building if it's not nuclear?  And I thought the two options in my mind was the elevator or the stairs.  The elevator or the stairs.  And with that, the dream ended.  Upon waking up, I really thought the answer is very simple.  If you're in such a situation as an explosion, do not take the elevator because the electricity can cut off and you'd be stuck in a cage.  So always take the stairs.  I hope that may save someone's life in the future, but you always take the stairs.  Don't take the elevator.  I should have known the answer to that.  I told this dream to our family.  I told it to our closest leaders.  And I'll just give you some possible interpretations.  I don't know yet what all of the symbolism means.  But dream is a type of language.  It's usually not literal.  So first of all, I am not predicting here.  I want to be very clear.  Dreams are given in dream language.  So this represents that.  And it's often a play on word.  So I did not say that God told me that the Melbourne CBD is dangerous.  You can't go work there or eat there and it's going to explode.  Because first of all, we don't really have big soccer matches in Melbourne.  But in my dream, it was a big soccer match in Melbourne.  And it was clearly Melbourne.  It was clearly the Melbourne CBD.  And that word was, that acronym CBD was given to me.  So my son Austin says, he thinks that the two stones means the two commandments, the 10 commandments written on the two tablets.  I thought that was a very good scriptural interpretation.  My daughter said, could the scrolls be the seals?  Because the seals are broken to do what?  To unfold or open a scroll.  So this may be relating to the seven seals of Revelation that they're being broken now.  It doesn't mean that we're in the tribulation.  It means these are pre-tribulation seals.  The other thought that came to me right away was, you know, I taught the undeniable proof that we're living in the end times.  And one of the things we looked at in depth was Zechariah 5.  This is a mystery to many people because it talks about the flying scrolls.  The flying scrolls were here again, you know, a few years later, I get this dream talking about the scrolls, the two scrolls inside the two stones.  Somehow they were very important to kicking the ball into the goal.  And the scrolls in Hebrew is the Megillah.  And this Megillah is flying.  So something very prophetic and very unusual about flying scrolls, because scrolls don't fly.  And I taught that in the undeniable proof that we're living in the end times and that the Messiah is coming soon.  So we covered that already, but just that dream reminded me of that teaching, that it seems to be another layer, another facet of that teaching about Zechariah 5.  My daughter also said the CBD could represent the financial district.  In many cities around the world, the CBD is your financial district, so it could represent the bank.  She said, money is corrupt and the economy is going to explode.  People watch it happen, but they don't die.  So it's an interesting explosion.  It goes in chains.  It goes in almost like an explosive domino, but people don't die.  They're just watching.  The last way that I would advise you if you're having dreams like this about the end time is to look for the play on words.  so cbd was definitely in the dream.  what does it represent?  if you google it the first thing that comes up is it's a it's an active compound in cannabis.  now i don't know that the thought cannabis really comes to mind whatsoever but That's one of the first things you would Google and find.  CBD also represents, or is the acronym for the Caribbean Development Bank.  So since my daughter said it could represent the bank, I wonder if there's going to be a failure of the Caribbean Development Bank.  Possibly.  This is a bank that was established since 1969.  It also means, CBD, cash before delivery.  Cash before delivery.  I thought, now that sounds prophetic.  The cash before delivery is gonna explode.  Well, it's already been exploding.  People are saying we don't accept cash all over Melbourne.  And over Australia, I assume wherever you are listening, maybe they're saying, we don't want to touch cash.  Cash is dirty.  So what are people doing?  They're going digital.  They're going cashless.  So it may happen much faster than we think, this cashless society.  And why is that important?  Because if you don't deal with physical cash and you're dealing with only electronic digits, then it's much easier to track your life, monitor your life, and control your life.  And this is what the Antichrist system, the beast system is about.  It's that they want to absolutely control you.  Take away privacy from us and then control us and say it's for our good.  So is this thing going to explode upon us?  No more cash before delivery.  Those are the thoughts that I have right now.  I just want to tell you that these things align with the Bible because Joel chapter 2 says that in the end time, verse 28, it shall come to pass afterward.  that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh.  Your sons and your daughters will prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, and your young men shall see visions.  And also on my men servants and on my maid servants, I will pour out of my Spirit in those days.  Then with these dreams, we get the signs in the skies, the sun being darkened, the moon turning to blood.  All that is within this chapter.  And then Peter actually quotes that on the day of Pentecost and says, look, this is being fulfilled.  Now, when it says this will come to pass afterwards, this increase in prophetic messages, in dreams, in visions, it's going to come to pass after what?  This is what you need to know.  I think this is the encouraging thing.  He said in verse 25, a great restoration, a great justice is going to be served.  Verse 25, so I will restore to you the years that the swarming locust has eaten, the crawling locust, the consuming locust, the chewing locust, my great army which I sent among you.  you shall eat plenty and be satisfied.  Wow, this is a good verse to know right now.  No matter what economic downturn you might face in your nation, the Bible says, you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God who has dealt wondrously with you.  And my people shall never be put to shame.  Then you shall know that I am in the midst of Israel.  I am the Lord your God.  There is no other.  My people shall never be put to shame.  after that vindication, that act of justice, that restoration, then comes an outpouring of the Spirit.  Then comes an outpouring of visions and dreams.  And I think these are all the tick-tock of the clock, the prophetic clock saying, we're nearing the end.  We're coming to the time when we'll welcome Jesus.  He's coming home to be with us.  So what an awesome privilege it is to receive these words from the Lord.  His mind is unfathomable.  Sometimes we get things that we don't yet fully understand, but that's why it's Him.  He's communicating to us.  So I'd encourage you, as you get messages from the Lord, write them down.  Don't always beat yourself up if you don't understand immediately.  Wait patiently.  Pray, and you will see that these dreams do come to pass.  If you're one of my online church members in Patreon, I want to hear about your dreams and visions.
