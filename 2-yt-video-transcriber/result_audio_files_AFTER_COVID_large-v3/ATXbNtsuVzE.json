            "text": "Praise be Jesus Christ.  The reason that I'm trying to follow the Lord Jesus wholeheartedly, and trying is the operative word.  We're all a work in progress.  But the reason I'm trying to follow the Lord Jesus is because I've fallen in love with Him.  I've come to recognize that He is the one whom my soul loves.  I'm following the God who made me.  My soul longs for Him.  I was made for Him.  And I also follow the Lord Jesus, frankly, because I don't want to spend all of eternity in hell.  I want to spend eternity in heaven, what I call partying forever, the eternal banquet.  Sign me up.  And early in my priesthood, I came to a place where I could finally, confidently, and humbly, I think, tell people I don't want to go to hell.  In our day today, speaking about hell is very politically incorrect, even within the Catholic Church.  Not all, but many Catholics, even Catholic leaders, won't allow people to speak about hell.  As soon as you mention the H-E-L-L word, they say, well, we don't talk about that anymore.  We don't want to scare people.  And I get that.  Some people, they've been so beaten up all their life, the last thing they need is someone kind of warning them of coming punishments.  I get that.  But we can't throw the baby out with the bathwater.  The fact is, is one day we'll all be judged.  And those who haven't opened their heart to the Lord Jesus and accepted him and accepted strived to live their life according to the Lord's commandments, those people, they might not be spending eternity in heaven.  And no servant is greater than his master.  If the Lord Jesus warned people, lovingly warned people, about the coming judgment and the possibility of burning in hell for all of eternity, we can't excuse ourselves and say, well, we don't do that anymore.  Let me read to you, do you like the scary scriptures?  I like the scary scriptures.  Here's a scary scripture, Revelation chapter 20.  Blessed and holy is is the one who shares in the first resurrection.  The first resurrection is when in this life we accept Jesus into our heart and he fills us with the Holy Spirit and what makes us new.  We fall in love with God and he makes us a new creation.  That's the first resurrection.  The second resurrection, obviously, is when after we die, we're raised up to eternal life in heaven.  That's the second resurrection that lasts forever.  The second death... has no power over these.  Now the second death, the first death, is obviously when this mortal life ends.  That's the first death.  We're all going to suffer the first death.  Unless maybe like Enoch and Elijah, or like our Blessed Mother too, we get raised up, assumed into heaven, but all of us will experience the first death.  The second death is after we die, if we haven't opened our hearts to the Lord Jesus and accepted him and tried to live according to his commands, then we'll experience the second death, which is eternal damnation.  Now it goes on to say in verse 8, speaking of Satan, he will go out to deceive the nations.  And that's one of the tragedies of our time.  is so many, even of our Catholics, have been deceived by the devil.  Many of them, for example, they'll vote for a pro-abortion politician, a politician who's aggressively pushing the killing of unborn children, deceived by the devil.  It goes on to say, the devil who had led them astray was thrown into the pool of fire and sulfur where the beast and the false prophet were.  There they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.  And we don't want to be there with the devil.  so simply.  recognize your dignity.  You're a child of God.  You were made by a loving Father in heaven, and Jesus died for you.  Accept his love.  Allow the Lord to fill you with the power of the Holy Spirit so you can follow him.  Be patient with yourself because it's a hard road, but we're all in this together.  We want eternal life with the angels and the saints.  Viva Christore! ",
