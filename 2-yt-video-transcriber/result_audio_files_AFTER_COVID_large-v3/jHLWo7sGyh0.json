            "text": "Because I discuss controversial topics, tons of YouTube channels have made response videos to me over the last few years.  Most have been brand new channels attempting to ride my coattails.  There I was just going through my Facebook page when all of a sudden, just like the Kool-Aid man, the video bursts into my Facebook wall and causes a very big hole in my happiness.  Douchebags reveling in cathartic insults.  Holy Kool-Aid.  An atheist cartoon character.  There's a man who knows his audience.  Or just bad responses that completely miss the points of my videos.  So I've never really responded to any of them.  Until now.  The other day I received a very professional response video by Trent Horn.  who's an author, debater, podcaster, and YouTuber with master's degrees in theology, philosophy, and bioethics, and he's also a staff apologist for Catholic Answers.  I figured this video was worth addressing in this series for the purpose of expanding this dialogue and to really get at the truth as to whether or not the Bible actually is or is not historically accurate.  This is Nothing Fails Like Bible History.  Rebutted, Rebutted!  In my first video, I showed how absolutely massive our collection of Egyptian writings and artifacts is, and how in none of it is there sufficient evidence for the Exodus story.  Trent's main rebuttals to my video can be broken down into one of two categories.  One, why we haven't found the evidence that we would expect to find, and two, why the evidence that we've found is good enough.  I'll be covering part one of that in this video, and part two in the next one. ",

So if you have all this evidence, why don't we have similar evidence of the Exodus being directly described in Egyptian texts?  Well, what I would say is that's true.  We would expect to have a lot of artifacts from Egypt, but not that we would have evidence for everything.  There's still things that haven't been discovered yet.  After all, ancient Egyptian history spreads over 3,000 years, so there's a lot of artifacts that have been discovered, but there's things that we still haven't discovered yet.  For example, an archaeologist named Chris Naughton talks about how we still haven't discovered particular tombs of very famous people like Amenhotep or Cleopatra.  So people are still looking for these and other Egyptian sources.  Artifacts we have are missing pieces from statues.  Even in the pictures that Westbrook was showing, there's papyri.  Some of them are reconstructed and have missing elements and pieces in them. ",

The Egyptians were well aware of the Nile's flooding, and built their houses, temples, and fortresses either on higher elevation areas or far enough away from the river to avoid being washed away.  There are cities in the Nile Delta that date back thousands of years, and just last year, archaeologists discovered ancient tombs in the delta that date back to before the Exodus.  Furthermore, Avaris, which would later become Pyrameses, where the Hebrews allegedly departed from at the start of the Exodus, was one of the largest cities in the world at the time.  This wasn't just a bunch of floodland.  And the other city the Hebrews allegedly built, Pithom, was east of the Nile Delta.  On top of this, even if the entire Nile Delta was completely removed from the equation, there are plenty of historical records written about the towns and people in this region all throughout Egypt.  So we should expect to find some record of the Jewish exodus in at least one of these other towns. ",

So we're wondering, the objection is, if Israel left the Goshen here, left being under the control of Pharaoh in Egypt, and then wandered into the Promised Land, where is the evidence of this kind of wandering?  You know, these people are... nomads they've traveled, where is the archaeological evidence for all these people going from here over to here this short distance?  Well, Israel Finkelstein, who is a very critical archaeologist, he dismisses the Exodus account and its historicity, and Westbrook quotes him later in the video.  But this is what he says that we wouldn't expect to find this kind of evidence.  Finkelstein says, Nomadic societies do not establish permanent houses, and the constant migration permits them to move only minimal belongings.  Moreover, their limited resources do not facilitate the creation of flourishing material culture that could leave rich archaeological finds.  So, if Israel, if the Hebrews left the Goshen and then migrated into Canaan after they left their toils in Egypt, we wouldn't necessarily expect to find many things from them.  You know, you could expect.  in permanent habitations you'll find things like pottery that stand up over time.  But nomads, like the Israelites, didn't travel with things like pottery.  They would have used animal skins to contain water, for example.  They wouldn't have made permanent housing.  They would have used tents to dwell in when they were wandering and traveling nomadically with herds and things like that.  Things like tents, animal skins to hold water, they just don't hold up well over time.  We're talking about something that happened over 3,000 years ago. ",

The problem was they're tasty little birds people like to make a potted pigeon out of, and they're easy to catch.  People would set up these giant nets to catch them, and they were overhunted to the point of extinction.  So there used to be... Billions of passenger pigeons.

Unless they're frozen in ice in normal, warm, wet climates, even human skeletons will usually completely break down after a few hundred years, all except for the teeth.  But in hot, dry deserts like Egypt and Sinai, skeletons can naturally be preserved and last for thousands and thousands of years.  So no, we don't expect to find all 2 million skeletons, but it's not unrealistic to expect a population that size in the desert to leave behind.  at least some remains.

Now, the number of Israelites the Bible claimed were living in and then departed from Egypt is insane.  And fortunately, Trent Horn agrees with me on that.  One rabbi even says that 3 million Jews were at Sinai and claims that that's only 20% of the Jewish population at the time, and according to the Talmud, 80% of them stayed behind in Egypt.  So 12 million Jews stayed in Egypt even longer and still left no trace of their existence? ",

Where a lot of people get the millions figure... It's from the book of Exodus, in Exodus 12, 37, where it says, \"...the people of Israel journeyed from Ramses to Succoth, about 600,000 men,\".  the word there is elep in Hebrew, \"...on foot besides women and  children.\".  The word elep there, E-L-E-P, at least that's the transliteration of it, that's a key word there, because it may not mean 600,000 individuals.  It can mean thousand, but it doesn't always mean thousand.  An elep can also mean just a clan or a military unit.  So in the book of Judges, Gideon speaks of his elep being the weakest in Israel, which is his clan.

And not just for the whole group.  They give exact numbers for every single tribe.  Here's just one of the lists.  Even if you assume that, say, the tribe of Gad doesn't have 45,650 men, but instead is 45 clans plus 650 men, then let's figure out just how big a clan is.  If you add up the number of you should get 598 clans plus 5,500 extra men.  But the census says that there were 603 clans plus 550 men, making a clan exactly equal to 1,000 men.

            "text": "While Trent doesn't outright say it here, it's really common that Christians will argue that absence of evidence isn't evidence of absence.  In other words, our lack of evidence isn't proof that it didn't happen, which is not a good argument at all.  For example, if you tell your insurance agent that your car was crushed under a semi today, and they come over to inspect it, but there isn't a ding or scratch anywhere on your car or on you, you can't just get annoyed at your insurance agent's skepticism and blurt out, just because there's no evidence, it doesn't mean I wasn't crushed under a semi.  Because it kind of does, if the scenario necessitates that said evidence should be there if it happened.  By the same reasoning, if millions of Hebrews lived in Egypt for over 400 years, summoned down plagues killing every firstborn Egyptian male, drowned the Pharaoh's army in a divinely divided Red Sea, and then wandered in the desert for 40 years living on magic bread, before in raiding Canaan and slaughtering all of its inhabitants, you would and should expect substantial evidence for such events.  Instead, so far, we just have excuse after excuse for why there isn't anything.  But Trent's not done, and in my next video, I'll discuss the evidence that he presents for the Exodus, and we'll see if there's actually anything convincing.
