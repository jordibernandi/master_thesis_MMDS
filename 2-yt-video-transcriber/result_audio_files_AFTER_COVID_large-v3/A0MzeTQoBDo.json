What's going on tonight, man?  Nothing much.  I'm not screaming.  I am talking and voicing my rights.  As a United States citizen, I am standing in a public way.  I'm not doing anything.  I am talking, like you said.  I'm talking.  I have every single right to do, and I'm standing in a public way.  When I can hear you across the street, you're no longer talking.  You understand that?  I mean, I was talking, so I don't know what you're talking about.  And I am recording everything in here in video.  I don't care.  So I could prove it to you.  Well, obviously, I understand that you don't, so that's why I'm here.  But I can hear you across the street, and that's a good 75 feet away.  Well, you probably have some great hearing.  No, no.  Because I am not screaming.  I have been here, and I'm not screaming.  I am voicing my opinion.  Well, like I said, I have my amendments, and they give me the right to voice my opinion.  Yeah, but you can't scream and yell.  I will calm down.  It won't happen again.  You got your name on you?  I don't have to give you my name because I'm not being suspected of a crime, so that's completely irrelevant right now.  Can I get your name and badge number, officer?  You get it?  Well, you asked for my vest.  You're recording anyway, right?  I am.  I'm actually going to zoom in.  What's your last name?  I don't have to give you my last name again because it's completely irrelevant.  I'm not being suspected of a crime, so I'm not going to give you my... Well, just say it's Jose.  You're violating a city ordinance.  I'm not violating a city ordinance right now.  I am standing in this public way.  Well, what's your last name?  Well, I wasn't yelling, and I'm not going to give you my last name because I'm not being suspected of any crime.  What's your last name?  Like I said, I'm not going to give you my last name.  I'm not suspected of any crime, so I have the right to give you no name.  You violated a city ordinance.  I'm not violating a city ordinance.  I wasn't standing here screaming.  Are you a lawyer by chance?  I don't have to be a lawyer.  I just know my rights.  Well, you don't know your rights.  I do know my rights.  Because you're standing out here.  I've done this three times already.  I know you have because you've got nothing better to do with your time.  I understand that.  I have nothing better to do.  No, I do have everything better to do.  I'm here protecting my rights and everybody else's rights because you guys too.  took a note and swore to the Constitution.  You guys are very violating right now.  You guys have no reason to do this right now.  I have no idea what you're talking about.  What do you mean?  I have no idea?  You have no idea about the law at all?  Yes, I do have an idea about the law.  Then are you a lawyer?  I don't have to be a lawyer.  Well, then how the hell do you know what you're talking about?  Because I can research it and I can understand and comprehend the laws.  What do you research?  That's completely irrelevant right now.  Because you don't have any research.  Like I said, you're doing this, like I said, you think you're doing something just, but you're really not.  It's completely irrelevant.  It's only to you.  this is this.  Okay, I'm going to stand here and stay quiet because I have the right to.  I'll not be suspected of a crime.  I'm going to stay here and stay quiet.  The next time I hear you, you're going to go to jail and you're going to get a city ticket.  You understand that?  This is the only warning you're getting for the whole night.  All right.  Have a great night, officer.  You too.  So, yeah.  He tried to prove me wrong.  I'm not going to fall down for him.  I'm going to stand here and do what I can do because I have that man next to me.  You guys failed again.  You guys failed.  Again, they're looking at me because they try to take me down and they can't take me down.  So I'm going to keep voicing my opinion because that's what I can do.  So I'm going to work my way over here.  And I'm going to end this video because I need it. ",
