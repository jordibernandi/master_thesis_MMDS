Hey, hey, hey, yo, hey, yo, hey, yo, hey, yo, hey, yo, hey, yo, hey, yo, hey, yo.  I'm a gun-toting patriot, God-fearing patriot.  Pricing why they mad, because I'm really maybe faking it.  Free speech advocate, it's on my mind, I'm saying it.  I'm about to buy another gun and ain't nobody taking it.  Guns, totem, Bible reading, God believe in truth.  Speaking American, it's MAGA season.  Democrats committing treason.  I know they think it's sweet, but you don't know who you're dealing with.  It's for free thinkers only.  You ain't got no membership.  They free General Flynn out the cage because he innocent.  Barton Rodger Stone is the one that he innocent.  We need to kick out every single illegal immigrant, mandatory voter ID laws.  We need to implement.  Tell Justice Smollett that I know this MAGA country.  Tell China we know they trying to play us like some dummies.  I looked deep into it and I did the math.  Why did Obama send money to that Wuhan lab?  What is George Soros doing with all of his cash?  Why did China take that Harvard guy and drop him a bag?  Why is there so much propaganda funding, you ask?  How about that Bill Gates vaccine?  Sorry, I'll pass, cause I'm a gun-toting patriot, goddamn patriot.  Pricing while they mad, cause I'm really maybe faking it.  Free speech advocate, it's on my mind, I'm saying it.  I'm about to buy another gun and ain't nobody taking it.  Gun-toting patriot, goddamn patriot.  Pricing while they mad, cause I'm really maybe faking it.  Free speech advocate, it's on my mind, I'm saying it.  I'm about to buy another gun and ain't nobody taking it.  Yeah, that's how we ball.  Yeah.  Okay, bury him a legend, yeah, Trump, hey.  Okay, America's biggest blessing.  Free speech, advocate, packing, never lacking it.  I just bought another gun and ain't nobody taking it.  Gang, gang, gang.  Okay, the White House going brazy now.  Magazine, tell them liberals they can't break us down.  It's up, they know we run it, best believe it now.  About to paint the city red, please don't burn it down.  Gang, gang, gang.  And I want to make this clear as well.  If you want to come and get my rifle, good luck. ",
