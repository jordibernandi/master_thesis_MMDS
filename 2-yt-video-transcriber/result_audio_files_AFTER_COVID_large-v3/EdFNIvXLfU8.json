            "text": "Hello and welcome back to No Bullshit.  Today we continue covering the silliness and pro-woke and social justice warrior lean.  Marvel comics and their media properties have become notorious for lately.  Gone are the days when the Marvel Cinematic Universe was just a humble up-and-coming film franchise, building out a simple but very well thought out and smart cinematic universe.  By making superhero-based action-adventure movies everyone can love.  No, since about 2017, things have been getting more political, more diverse, and more SJW influences have been coming through in their pictures.  Dramatically since about that time when Spider-Man Homecoming came to theaters in that summer.  But back then, we really had no idea it would get this bad.  Spider-Man was still a pretty good movie, all things considered, despite the obvious signs of forced diversity and, of course, the blackwashing of Spider-Man's love interests.  Then in 2018, we got Black Panther, of course, followed by 2019's Captain Marvel, and since then, we've been promised all kinds of crazy things like an all-girls Avengers movie, which was teased in the last film with this cringy all-girls shot right here, and we've also been promised other female-led movies and projects, like the two coming out this year called Black Widow and The Eternals, which has another obnoxiously diverse cast to boot.  And that movie's supposed to have an upcoming gay kiss in it, too.  Can't wait.  Then we got what we're talking about today.  A new plan and wing of the Marvel series is being premiered.  They're now going to create their own TV shows for the new streaming service, Disney+.  Disney, of course, has owned Marvel for a while.  And among the eight or so announced or planned series, three of them are already promising to be female-led.  The first being WandaVision, and then Ms.  Marvel and She-Hulk.  The latter of which we're going to be talking about more today.  Today, I'd like you to meet Dana Schwartz.  She's a writer of books no one's heard of.  So, of course, her woman status and ability to manage a Word document got her a cushy writing job for Marvel's upcoming She-Hulk streaming series.  And in addition to living in the liberal cesspool that is Los Angeles, California, Dana is also a rabid SJW who specifically hates a certain kind of people, which I'm sure you can guess who.  Let's all say it together, class.  Dana hates straight white males.  Now, With that said, it really shouldn't surprise us that she's going after one of the funniest and most famous and well-liked group of white dudes ever.  The creators of South Park, of course.  As the title of this video suggests, this Marvel writer is trying to cancel South Park this week.  And not only is she totally wrong for what she said and why she's trying to do this, but also... As most of you know, South Park is one of my favorite shows of all time.  I have a long-running, highly popular South Park Explained series right on this channel, talking about their new episodes every time they come out in each fall season.  Now, that's not to say I'm biased in a bad way.  Sure, I'm going to lean towards them, but it's because I know what's going on here.  And what I mean and the point is, I've been watching and keeping up with South Park since the very beginning, when it came out in the 1990s.  I've seen every single episode and have been watching it every year for all 23 seasons, so... That means I'm not only a fan, I'm hip, and I know what's going on, and I know the when, how, and why, and that's why I'm in a perfect position to put this She-Hulk SJW Dana Schwartz while I'm putting her on blast for being dead wrong about all of this.  Now, before we get too far ahead of ourselves, let's turn to her first tweet that started this whole recent wave of cancel South Park in the news.  Here, Dana tweets, In retrospect, it seems impossible to overstate the cultural damage done by South Park.  The show that portrayed earnestness as the only sin and taught that mockery is the ultimate inoculation against all criticism.  Okay, wow.  First of all, this girl writes like she's a high school lit student.  This is how children speak when they first learn big words.  But regardless, let me try and break it down and decipher what she's even trying to say.  I mean, I think we all get the gist of it, but her phrasing and over-the-top vocabulary is so clouded and unnecessarily fluffy in order for her to try and sound smart.  And I think that's because her point is bad and flawed and she can't make it easily.  It only kind of makes sense if you put it in this over-the-top convoluted esoteric way, likely meant to only be read and interpreted by her starkly liberal follower base.  So with all that said, let's break this down beat by beat then.  In retrospect is of course a fanciful way of saying when looking back.  And when this SJW looks back, she claims it's impossible to overstate the cultural damage done by South Park.  And while I could see what she's trying to say, and I might agree with it in some sense, I certainly wouldn't put it that way.  Not to oversimplify everything here, although her writing does seem to need it, especially considering this is going up on a low IQ platform like Twitter, and most of her bot-like Russian agent followers are likely only able to pretend they know what she means, but... As for the term cultural damage, I'm not even sure what that's supposed to mean at all.  Sounds like some made-up BS SJW baloney, being used to try and overhype the supposed negative impact South Park has had.  But it hasn't.  South Park has had great positive impact.  It's a legendary, comedic, hilarious, well-liked show which everyone can enjoy.  And if you don't like it, just don't watch it.  But you don't have to be a hater and try to cancel it for everyone else.  It's really that simple.  So when I see a phrase like this saying South Park caused cultural damage, I see that more as it having a cultural impact, which could be good or bad.  I, of course, would say it's very good.  And I really think saying a show had bad impact is much harder to prove too.  And it causing cultural damage is surely an overstatement or exaggeration.  Really, I'm willing to bet what this woke Marvel writer is really upset about is, South Park makes fun of liberals and SJWs like her sometimes too.  And since South Park's so popular and influential in comedy and television, Dana Schwartz here wants to call them bad bats and evil and meanie heads for saying things she doesn't like.  She probably truly believes her radical leftist beliefs are beyond reproach.  and unquestionable and completely right without second thought.  really in the mind of an sjw they're always right and they're heroes and anyone who disagrees with them or goes up against them even in the slightest way well that's called hate speech and wrong and criminal and we should all get banned for disagreeing with liberals at least according to them.  and back to the can't overstate part of this tweet for a moment.  well this chick must be really bad at overstating things if she can't overstate the so-called cultural damage south park obviously hasn't done.  for example I can easily overstate the cultural damage done by South Park just by saying, South Park is the cause of all the world's problems.  All arguments, disagreements, war, and genocide is caused by this show.  That's all caused by South Park, as are most breakups and outbreaks of deadly viruses.  This is all the cultural damage done by South Park.  You see what I did there?  That wasn't so hard.  So, with that in mind, Dana must be really terrified.  terrible at overstating things if you can't do something as simple as what I said.  And keep in mind, this girl is a writer and she's writing for the new Marvel comic book series She-Hulk.  So surely she should have at least some kind of imagination or creativity to pull from there.  I got a feeling a very boring and dull She-Hulk series is on its way.  if this chick is what's behind it.  And she can't even overstate the impact of a cartoon show about farts, poopy pants, and social commentaries?  Come on.  Next, Dana claims South Park portrayed earnestness as the only sin.  Yet another line that we need to get a dictionary out to interpret properly.  Now, this may sound like me being a dummy or not as smart, but really, I'm just being a layman and speaking normally and pointing out how this Dana girl is a wannabe smart tryhard.  And sure, I can again get the gist of what she's trying to say, and I think we can all guess what these words and points mean, but... Man, I don't know.  Following someone like this just seems taxing.  And I feel like we can already tell this chick is not nearly as smart as she thinks she is.  Regardless, according to the dictionary, earnestness means sincerity and intense conviction.  Now, with that said, I guess I can kind of see why Dana would bring this up.  Goofing on so-called earnest people is a trend you could find on the South Park show, but... I would never say that they portrayed earnestness as the only sin.  They've had over 300 episodes with a wide variety of stories, content, commentaries, and messages.  For example, last season there was an episode about the Border Patrol terrorizing a young kid and making him into this sort of Mexican Joker.  How does that have anything to do with sincerity and conviction?  I don't really know.  And I really think this claim from Dana is just weak and ill-thought-out, and most importantly, it's biased as hell once again.  She's basically trying to say South Park is this nihilist group of haters who doesn't care about anything, and they make fun of you if you do care.  And according to them, all they do is bash good Samaritan superhero-like people like these liberals, or at least how they think they are.  They see themselves as these earnest, sincere, highly convicted individuals, so when South Park makes fun of them for that, watch out.  And I say please, you're not a superhero Dana, you just write for one that no one's ever heard of.  And as for South Park bashing supposedly earnest people over the years, well that's certainly happened here or there.  And I'm not denying that, but usually it's South Park bashing people who want to appear earnest, like the left-wingers.  And they've also mocked earnest religious people and authoritarian conservatives, too.  Keep that in mind.  So really, the truth here is, Dana believes that her own leftist political views and instincts are so perfect and objectively true, they're beyond reproach or critique.  You can't talk bad about them.  And clearly she can't stand to see them mocked to any degree.  And that's the real reason for this anti-South Park tirade.  Lastly for this tweet, Dana says one final highly convoluted phrase, it being South Park taught that mockery is the ultimate inoculation against all criticism, whatever that means.  Inoculate obviously means to treat someone with a vaccine to produce immunity against a disease.  So, I guess in this situation, the mockery is the vaccine to protect people from the disease of criticism.  Not sure what this has to do with South Park, though.  I mean, the show certainly didn't teach people to mock their critics, if that's what she's implying.  And that's the trick here, isn't it?  Dana speaks so over-the-top and in such weird, convoluted ways, it makes it hard to pin down what she's actually trying to say or mean.  This way, she can easily wheeze out of things later if she wants to.  And also she can claim this means many different things when it suits her in certain situations.  But I say it's just totally false and made up BS.  Just because a comedy cartoon show mocks a lot of people doesn't mean they're teaching us to mock all our critics.  In reality, when smarty pants, big brain liberals like this say criticism, they mean something totally different.  Really, they bash and hate and attack their opponents and lie about us.  Often making shit up like in this tweet and then they frame their BS as them just giving constructive criticism.  Like they're taking the high road and trying to help you when really they're not.  You hating a show because you can't take a joke when they make fun of you.  That's not you being some kind of smart TV critic.  That's you getting butt hurt and looking stupid and saying things that don't make sense.  Next, things get really interesting when Dana admits that she hasn't even been watching the South Park show lately.  Here she even tweets out an older article from 2018 as if it's new news.  She says, It seems like South Park has been trying to reckon with this.  I admit I haven't been watching the show in recent seasons, but I'm fascinated to see this.  Okay, yikes.  First of all, we went over this story in South Park ManBearPig episode back in 2018 when it came out.  But basically, to put it briefly, South Park revisited a topic they previously shat upon about 15 years ago.  Back then, they were more leaning on the global warming is a myth side, but recent news has confirmed it does exist, albeit the importance of it still gets highly overblown.  Regardless, South Park decided to do the right thing and readdress the situation.  even somewhat apologizing to Al Gore, the leader of the global warming movement back in the day, in their new episode.  But as for South Park supposedly trying to reckon with this, well, I think that's just Dana's way of saying they now have the right approved liberal talking points.  So they're doing better now, according to her, but... South Park better not deviate from SJW policies anymore, or she'll try and cancel them once again.  And this is all coming from an airhead who hasn't even seen this episode, nor has she watched the show in years, if ever.  In the end, I wouldn't be surprised if a lefty like Dana Schwartz hadn't seen South Park much at all.  Maybe an episode or two here or there, but certainly not enough to cast this kind of blanket judgment upon the show, which has been around for over two decades.  And with all that said, someone like this should not get to say whether South Park gets canceled, a meme which South Park actually made itself as a joke when they did the hashtag cancel South Park a couple seasons ago.  That hashtag was a joke they made in 2018, but in actuality, we know the show isn't going anywhere, thank God.  The creators said they'll make it as long as possible, and Comedy Central better do the smart thing and keep South Park around forever.  since it is their only remaining legacy program besides the dwindling Daily Show.  And really, back to Dana Schwartz, she's just mad because she heard about a time South Park made fun of climate change, I guess.  Or she might have seen a scene of it on YouTube where they were goofing on safe spaces or alphabet people.  These kinds of jokes out of context and these minor infractions are all it takes for a radical left-wing SJW to come after our beloved show like this and imply it needs to be gone or fixed or changed or something.  The other thing working against South Park, of course, is the fact that it's wildly popular and legendary and influential.  And more importantly, and the thing that irks leftists the most, is South Park is independent in their free thinking and their anti-SJW and anti.  pretty much everything this new modern woke left wing is all about.  Before we go, I got a few more tweets to look at to see what this tirade for Dana was really about.  Because here, she even explicitly calls out the South Park creators Matt and Trey for committing the crime of being straight white males.  And I'm not just saying this to deflect or exaggerate either.  Dana tweets anti-white male shit all the time.  For example, here's a picture gathering a number of her most offensive and anti-white tweets.  First, she outright says novels by white men should be banned from schools for the next 20 years.  Gee, I wonder why.  Would love to hear the BS rationalization for how that's not offensive.  But as we know, most of it comes down to the idea that you can't be racist to white people.  At least according to these liberal anti-white racists.  And remember, this is the same kind of idea or tactic that other races have used over the years for generations.  For example, slaveholders had similar rationalizations when they persecuted their captors, particularly the African American slave trade, which treated those people like animals back in the day.  And 1940s Germans also had equally racist and offensive thoughts about Jewish people in their time, again, likening them to animals or monsters.  making it so the racism against them is easier to tolerate.  And now in current year, white people are treated like animals too.  We're the only people you can openly hate against and be racist towards and get away with it.  Or even, you could get promoted and propped up for hating on whites and art creations like novels or South Park.  I mean, why do you think this Dana chick got hired by Marvel here anyway?  And why else would they keep her around and put her on this She-Hulk project?  after all we've seen in her recent internet history?  What do you guys think?  Should South Park be cancelled because a Marvel writer got her feelings hurt?  Do you think that the She-Hulk series stands a chance?  With a no-name, no-imagination, low-IQ writer like this, she's also got smug written all over her face, so it's no wonder South Park set her off.  That show and us the viewers here, we've been laughing it up at stuff like this, at these stuck-up, hippy-dippy, fart-sniffing smug liberals for decades now.  But just because you were the butt of a joke or two doesn't mean South Park should be cancelled or censored, at least in my opinion.
