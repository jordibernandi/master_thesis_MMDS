I knew that the tapes were \u2013 these were a series of phone calls that we had, mostly phone calls.  And Bob Woodward is somebody that I respect just from hearing the name for many, many years, not knowing too much about his work, not caring about his work.  But I thought it would be interesting to talk to him for a period of calls.  So we did that.  I don't know if it's good or bad.  I don't even know if the book is good or bad.  But certainly if he thought that was a bad statement, he would have reported it because he thinks that, you know, you don't want to have anybody that is going to suffer medically because of some fact.  And he didn't report it because he didn't think it was bad.  Nobody thought it was bad.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  And your question, the way you phrased that is such a disgrace.  It's a disgrace to ABC Television Network.  It's a disgrace to your employer.  And that's the answer.  Are you ready?  Because I love... Of course I didn't.  Of course I didn't.  No, no.  No, no.  We've had flu years.  The President And five times, right?  Five times.  You ever hear the expression, five times?  We've had flu years where we lost 100,000 people.

This is China's fault.  This is nobody's fault but China.  China should not have allowed it to happen.  Whether you have one person, 180,000 people, or 2.5 or 3 million people, which it could have been very seriously if we didn't make the moves.  And when you look at the opposition, where they said, oh, why did he put the ban on?  Dr.  Fauci said we saved hundreds of thousands of lives by putting the ban on China, and then ultimately putting the ban on Europe.  There was no lie here.  What we're doing is we're leading, and we're leading in a proper way.  And if, frankly, somebody else was leading it, they wouldn't have closed it.  If you look at Nancy Pelosi, You look at Cuomo.  You look at de Blasio.  You look at Biden.  Months later, they said, there's no problem.  They're talking about me.  Months later.  And before any statement was made, you have to remember, I put the ban on China.  So, obviously, outwardly, I said, it's a very serious problem.  And it's always a serious problem.  That doesn't mean I'm going to jump up and down in the air and start saying, people are going to die, people are going to die.  No.  No, I'm not going to do that.  We're going to get through this.  And we're right now, I hope, really think we're going to, we're rounding the final turn.  And a lot of good things are happening with vaccines and with therapeutics.  But there's no lying.  And the way you asked that question is very disgraceful.  Bill, go ahead, please.  Go ahead.  I think we did a great job.  I think we did a great job.  And the people that did such, our generals, our admirals, Mike Pence, all of the people, that have worked so hard, and now Dr.  Atlas, and all of the, Dr.  Fauci, Dr.  Birx, They should be respected for the job they've done.

If Bob Woodward thought that was bad \u2014 because this is stuff that everyone knew \u2014 there's a report that I have here someplace where China said it was airborne earlier than the statements I made.  People knew it was airborne.  This was nothing.  This was no big \u2014 when I say it was airborne, everybody knew it was airborne.  This was no big thing.  The Press I know that in February.  The President Read the reports.  China came out with a statement that it was an airborne disease.  I heard it was an airborne disease.  I assumed it early on.  The fact is, there has to be a calmness.  You don't want me jumping up and down, screaming, there's going to be great death, there's going to \u2014 and really causing some very, very serious problems for the country.  If Bob Woodward thought what I said was bad, then he should have immediately, right after I said it, gone out to the authorities so they can prepare and let him know.  But he didn't think it was bad, and he said he didn't think it was bad.  He actually said he didn't think it was bad.  The only one that said it was bad or thinks it was bad were the fake news media, because they take it and they try and put it a certain way.  If Bob Woodward thought it was bad, then he should have immediately gone out publicly, not wait four months.  You know, he's had that statement for four months, maybe five months.  He's had it for a long time.  It was a series of taped interviews, mostly by telephone.  Quick ones, not long ones, quick ones.  And I did it out of curiosity because I do have respect and I want to see.  I wonder whether or not somebody like that can write.  good.  I don't think he can, but let's see what happens. ",
