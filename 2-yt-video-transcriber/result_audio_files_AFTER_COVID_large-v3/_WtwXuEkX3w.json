It's not any earthly kind of governmental body of any sort.  On top of that, the United States is not God's special country out of all the countries in the world.  It is a country that is in the midst of a gigantic experiment in trying to have a pluralistic society where all viewpoints can be heard freely.  That's what this woman is not aware of, it seems to me.  She thinks that we need God and the Christians who represent God to just completely take over.
