            "text": "Hi everyone, Sandman here.  This video is brought to you by a donation from Juan, and here's what he has to say.  Hey Sandman, thanks for still fighting the rigged game on YouTube.  Hang on because you're still winning, brother.  I just wanted to see if you can make a video about what I've learned this year from having white knight fumes.  I say this not to put free men down, but to humble ourselves in which we could learn from each other's mistakes and not do the same mistakes our ancestors did, which was just let it be or let it go.  It's just a moment.  I don't want mankind to keep repeating the same cycle again, lest we forget the past.  Maybe we as Migtown men have some white knight fumes in us from our blue pill days.  I say this because I've cut off 80% of female friends in the last three years, but I still seem to have an attraction to some of them since we were friends since grade school.  During the COVID epidemic, a female friend put up a video on Snapchat playing with her golden camel toe.  I couldn't even finish watching it.  So I told her about this being inappropriate and she went nuts.  The next day she brought it up saying it wasn't her but it was someone that hacked her phone and she would never do that.  That she's a normal person and blah blah blah.  So I got furious that she was straight up lying to my face that I told her at least change the colors on your nails so that your story is more believable.  Then I smiled and just laughed.  Maybe this will help other men out there that have female friends that will know that women will turn back to their nature from time to time.  Hopefully I could see some things in the comments section that help me out as well.  I've cut down more female friends since the coup began.  Well won.  Thanks for the donation as well as the topic.  I'll get to it in just a moment.  But let me first tell everyone about today's sponsor, the MGTOW Book Collection.  Tim Patten has written five MGTOW books.  MGTOW is Forever is the latest and is a great introduction to MGTOW.  If you've been injured on the job and need help, Disabled and Unable to Work is for you.  MGTOW Building Wealth and Power helps you empower your finances.  Masculinity is Our Future is about how the world sees masculinity as toxic and what it means to be a man.  Finally, MGTOW Why I Cheat.  When a woman named Marcia read this book, she wanted to scream out loud, why is MGTOW a real thing?  Thanks for pushing your buttons, Tim.  All five books can be found at the sponsor link down below.  Anyways, now back to the clown world show.  So Juan, the so-called female friend of yours, was stupid to post herself playing with her camel toe on Snapchat.  When you spoke to her about it, she was obviously gaslighting you and using the story surrounding the plausible deniability of someone hacking into her phone and posting that on her account.  that made herself look like the victim and made you look like an a-hole for bringing it up and criticizing her in the first place.  All that from a so-called friend.  Would a male friend have responded the same way if you called him out for accidentally posting his stiff sausage on Snapchat?  Probably not.  He'd probably just turn beet red that you saw him beating off, and you guys would just laugh at it afterwards.  But for a woman, she can't do that because she doesn't want people, even her so-called male friends, to think she's nothing but a slut.  What I've learned about when it comes to female friendships is that they tend to keep you around as a friend if you entertain them, educate them, or a guy they actually want to be with and are keeping the lines of communication open until you're single because you make them tingle.  Or perhaps they like the way that you jingle because your pockets are full of cash and coin.  I've had so-called female friends stop talking to me after years once they got into relationships.  But even still, one of them didn't tell me that she was married and blocked those pictures on Facebook so I couldn't see them even though she was still my friend.  I'm not sure, but I suspect that she did that just in case.  in the future if that marriage didn't work out, I would never know and then she could approach me again.  And I'd have no idea that she was married if she wanted to start things up with me.  I'd really love to see her squirm one day when I ask her what she had been up to for the last five to ten years.  That would be a hoot.  As for your so-called white knight fumes, that's something that I found is next to impossible to control.  We are hardwired by nature to provide and protect for women.  It's one of the main driving forces that led to the survival of our species, and if we didn't have it, we'd be nothing but monkeys still playing with our  feces.\".  As a species, we also have a hard time remembering the past because we seem to have a four-generational cycle, and after that, once the people that remembered something are all gone, we just tend to repeat it.  It doesn't matter that we have history books.  Unfortunately, it seems that unless our life experiences have an emotional impact on us, they don't stick with us as lessons that can be passed well into the future, after we're gone.  Just like none of us around today have any idea what traditionalism was really like.  We think we know what it was like, but we don't.  That's why it seems that we're doomed to decline and repeat the mistakes of society over and over again.  Culture doesn't seem to progress in a linear fashion, but more in a circular one.  As for that so-called female friend of yours, Juan, who would have thought that you bringing up her toying with her cooch would get her to bark back at you like a pooch.  I'm glad you cut out 80% of your so-called female friends out of your life.  Maybe you'll get to the point in your life where you just stop caring about what the other 20% that you're still interested in for sexy time think as well.  These days when I see my occasional Tinder matches or meet an interesting woman, I'm completely indifferent.  I'm turning into a thought because all I'm interested in is the validation I receive that women still want me.  But when I get that validation, I just stop caring.  I just want to know that I still got it.  Whatever it is.  To me, Juan, it sounds like that woman you called out for airing her cooch on the internets probably kept you around for the purpose of validation and attention.  You were supposed to drool at what you couldn't have, and you were supposed to contact her and want her, and she was supposed to get your attention.  But you weren't supposed to bring up her naughty bits, literally.  That was just the bait and you weren't supposed to call her out on it.  That's why she got pissed off.  But I'm glad she did because it shows that at least some women out there are desperate enough that they're willing to fondle their flesh folds over the phone.  It shows desperation on her part that she's not getting the attention she craves, so she's basically raising the stakes.  She obviously has no interest in having sex with anyone she showed it to.  She just wants to dangle a stake in front of a bunch of simps.  They can't taste it and then collect all the emotional attention she can from it.  The fact that she's not worried about being banned on Snapchat because of this should tell you what kind of power women have online these days.  She thinks she can violate the terms of service with impunity.  If I were you, Juan, what I would have done is contacted Snapchat and reported what she did, laying down my very own snatch trap so that the next time she logged in, she would be deplatformed.  It would be like sucking the oxygen out of her lungs so she couldn't metaphorically breathe.  so that she would suffocate due to a lack of attention.  Nothing says friendship like taking a woman's attention.  Sounds to me like this woman enjoys having men in the friend zone that she can get attention from.  I think there's a huge chunk of the female population out there that it's suffering during COVID because they aren't getting the normal levels of attention and emotional pick-me-up that they used to.  I think that the majority of women just go out on dating platforms like Tinder not to look for a boyfriend, but instead for that emotional pick-me-up.  Just like many of the so-called female friends a guy has in his life keep him around because of that attention.  Remember that Brieffold's Law states that in the animal kingdom.  there is no male and female relationship of any kind unless the woman can derive some sort of benefit from it.  Even being friend-zoned by her is beneficial to her.  Remember that for women attention is equivalent to sex for men.  Considering that there's a virtually unlimited number of men out there that want to have sex with a woman, she has a virtually limitless pool of so-called male friends to pull attention from.  I've got certain female photography and video clients that just call me up for work, but spend more than half of our time on the phone together talking about their life.  They of course are looking for another emotional tampon friend, because for whatever reason the other ones are busy.  I don't care because it gives me material for my channel, and I'm also getting paid.  But if this was just a woman that was a friend, that wanted to waste my time and chat with me dumping her toxic emotional waste all over me, I'd ignore her when she wanted to talk.  Of course if I was still interested in dating and sex like you seem to be one, I too would still talk to the super attractive women that I was orbiting.  That's just it.  You're not friends with these women, you're the orbiting bodies around them, and they are the sun.  Friendships with women only work temporarily if there's some sort of mutually beneficial circumstance surrounding them.  If you get something from being in her friend zone, like advice about your life, then that might make it work.  But it's not like a friendship with one of your bros.  There is no bonding in the traditional sense.  It's generally always transactional, or she's just orbiting you hoping that you notice and that you get in her pants.  A lot of times if you don't make a move for a few weeks or a month and she sees that you're not interested, suddenly she will disappear and you will lose your so-called friend.  A friend that never really was and she'll lose the relationship that she was hoping for.  I have to repeat again that because men don't teach each other about these lessons from one generation to the next, it's like every man is learning these lessons for the first time in history.  Women also obviously don't want us passing down these lessons to one another.  Knowledge about female nature is power, and no knowledge means men have no power.  That's what women want.  They want us to be powerless to their whims.  I don't think that you can really be friends with a woman.  It's just that there's no such thing, and you as the man has convinced yourself that it does exist.  Just like many guys listening to this have probably convinced themselves that the unicorn woman is out there after all, and she's waiting for you.  I think that's about all I got to say on that.  I want to direct everyone's attention to a fake article in the description called Woman on Tinder Faces Class Action Lawsuit After She Gave Craps to 139 Different Men.  It shows one of the most unattractive women you can imagine sporting a fabulous fupa with her queen-size muffin top.  The people writing this piece thought it would be impossible for something like this to happen.  But I bet you anything that a woman like her, if she went out on Tinder, could easily be able to sleep with 139 plus men.  After all, there are women out there that have been photoshopped with pig noses covered in body hair, and men would still smash that hairy pig lady's gash.  I bet that some of them would also open up to being friends with her and her fupa too.  She's probably got a kwato hiding in there somewhere, and she won't settle for anyone for marriage.  that doesn't look like young Arnold Schwarzenegger.  The guy writing a fake article where an unattractive woman can sleep with hundreds of guys hasn't done his research.  It's been known to happen all the time.  Guys can't afford to be picky with their pricks if they want to reproduce.  The funniest line from the fake article was from one man that said that he was leaving her bedroom after they just had sex.  Another man came in and he could clearly see a lineup of men waiting to get inside the room.  I guess this woman is like a roller coaster ride because the ride is short and there's literally a lineup of guys waiting behind to get on.  Putting up a picture of an Indian guy in the article also led a certain level of believability to the story because of sexual marketplace value dynamics and desperation.  Anyways, that's it for today.  Thanks again to Juan for the donation and topic.  Don't forget to smash the like button the way that that woman on Snapchat wanted you to smash her after seeing it.
