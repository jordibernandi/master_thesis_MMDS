            "text": "So the first article I wanted to talk about is entitled Ark Encounter Ticket Sales Continued to Plummet in November Due to COVID-19.  And this is on the Friendly Atheist website by Hemant Mehta.  But there's actually a deeper issue here that I wanted to talk about.  So let's take a look at the new Ark Encounter numbers and then we'll get into this.  Attendance at Arc Encanto remains at rock bottom during the pandemic.  It's not their fault, obviously, but the recovery has been slow for them, just like everyone else.  Thanks to a public record request by local paleontologist Dan Phelps, we now have the numbers for November.  You can read more background about how it's calculated here.  The bottom line, Ark Encounter had 24,105 paying visitors in November, but that's a far cry from the 37,686 they had last November.  It's also a significant drop from October, a reminder that the busiest part of the tourism season is over.  Here are all the attendance numbers we know, along with the safety fee that Answers in Genesis has paid to the city of Williamstown.  The public nature of that fee is how we know the attendance numbers at all.  So I was looking through this, and it's basically that it's the 2017 numbers, which I believe is when the Ark Encounter was originally constructed, the 2018 numbers, the 2019 numbers, and the 2020 numbers, right?  So according to these numbers... Originally, in 2018, January 2018, they had 13,000 people.  2019, they had 15,000, basically.  And then 2020, they had 16,000.  So it's an increase year over year.  A decent increase, you know?  Four or five percent is a respectable increase.  And if you remember correctly, February, I think February 22nd is when the stock market really started to plummet, which is what tells me.  that's roughly when the public really started taking things seriously with the pandemic, give or take.  So mid-February to late February, that's when things really started going downhill and people stopped going out, people stopped eating at restaurants and things like that.  March was a complete train wreck.  So 2019 in February, Arc Encounter saw 16,000 people.  2020, they saw 17,000 people, a respectable increase for any business, right?  In March 2019, they saw 70,000 people.  That's basically, from my understanding, that's because that's the beginning of the tourism season.  They can expect a lot of people to start coming around March.  And the following year, 2020, March saw 50.  15,000 people.  So it went from 70,000 the previous year to 15,000.  Holy shit, that is a serious drop.  In April, we saw zero.  Let's keep reading the article.  Remember that the ARC didn't shut down until March 17th, but it's clear there was lower attendance in the weeks prior to that too.  Their on-site conferences also had to be postponed.  Like other tourist attractions, they've missed out on spring break trips, summer vacations, and warmer weather in general.  Most workers at the Ark were also temporarily laid off.  They finally reopened on June 7th.  This issue actually calls back to something else that I've been paying close attention to.  Last week, or the week before, recently anyways, I covered another article about this guy named Greg Farrington, this pastor in Rockland, California, who claimed that Satan and liberal crazies were to blame for church closures and low church attendance and things.  Bear in mind, before I actually read this, We have no way of knowing if this is actually accurate.  I tried to find the statistics for this and I had a lot of trouble finding any information on it.  He could be fabricating this shit right off the top of his head.  So who fucking knows?  But this is what he said, quote, here are some current trends in the church world today.  30 to 40% of the people who attended church before COVID will never return to church.  20% of all churches in America will never open their doors again.  And 70% of pastors are looking for another place of employment.  There's a fact here.  The fact is church attendance is dropping.  That's true.  But at the very least, for the Methodist church, there's like a Methodist general conference.  And the general conference pays for the rent for the buildings.  They even own some of the buildings.  they pay the pastor's salaries, and they pay for everything, right?  Most churches, at the very least Methodists, and I know Baptists and Lutherans and Catholics and all kinds of others have a similar system set up, they have set this system up specifically so they can weather storms like this.  Like the church that Kylie's family goes to, it's a Methodist church, They have a system set up where the pastor gets his paycheck from the Methodist General Conference.  They already own the building and everything.  So maybe independent churches are having an issue here.  I have no doubt about that.  And I do know for a fact that churches are suffering from attendance drops, and we'll get into that more in a minute.  But I'm a little bit skeptical of this guy's claims.  I mean, we have no way of knowing that this is factual information.  Anyway, let's keep reading.  Do you know why?  It isn't because of a virus.  There is a demonic strategy to silence the church.  This virus came from China where they silenced the church.  And now the silence of a church in America is because there's a demonic force behind it.  The reality of this moment is the demonic strategy is working.  Guy is so full of shit.  Like, do I even dissect this?  I don't know.  I'm not going to.  I dissected it last week or whenever it was.  It's terrible.  Go look for the video if you're wondering about Greg Farrington.  But anyways, he continues on to say, that means 31 million people will never come back to church.  That means 80,000 churches will shut their doors and never meet again in that building.  That means 420,000 pastors are looking for new jobs.  And you're telling me this is a virus?  Again, I'm not even going to get into it right now.  But the point is, churches are suffering.  They are.  And the Ark Encounter is suffering.  They have been suffering terribly from this pandemic.  The Ark Encounter is something that you can donate to, but you can't really see it over Zoom.  It's not the same thing.  It's a very in-person kind of an activity.  But another issue that I wanted to mention is the fact that Jehovah's Witnesses lost members this year for the first year and who knows how long.  They had a 0.6% decrease in membership.  I think that's fucking awesome.  That's fantastic news.  And on top of the fact that they had a 0.6% decrease in membership, they had already made it easier to be considered an active member by decreasing the number of hours you have to report to be considered an active Jehovah's Witness.  They decreased it from, I don't know, 10 hours a month or something like that.  I don't remember what it was before, to 15 minutes per month from my understanding.  So if you write a single letter and mail it to a single person in the phone book, you're an active Jehovah's Witness, period, at any point in the month.  and they had a decrease in numbers despite that fact.  That is amazing news, in my opinion.  Let's keep reading the article and see what else Hemant Mehta had to say about this.  Remember that the ARC didn't shut down until March 17th, but it's clear there was lower attendance in the weeks prior to that, too.  Their on-site conferences also had to be postponed.  Like other tourist attractions, they've missed out on spring break trips, summer vacations, and warmer weather in general.  Most workers at the Ark were also temporarily laid off.  They finally reopened on June 7th.  That said, the Ark parent company, Crosswater Canyon, received between $1 million and $2 million from the Paycheck Protection Program.  Of course they did.  And Ken Ham also raised at least $1.1 million in a separate fundraiser to offset COVID-related losses.  Finally, keep in mind that actual attendance is higher than these numbers represent because kids get in for free, as do members with lifetime passes.  But giving away freebies to children and life members doesn't help the local economy as much as drawing in first-time customers who are ready to spend their money or conference attendees who are there for another reason.  I know Ken Ham kind of used this, what, scam, for lack of a better term, where he tried to get Kentucky, where this is, to give him these massive tax breaks because he said he'd be stimulating the local economy and all this other shit.  Ultimately, he did almost nothing for the local economy.  First of all, he didn't pay almost anything in taxes.  He evaded taxes where possible.  He used a lot of scummy tactics to build the arc.  And how many people is he really bringing in?  How much money are they really spending on the local economy?  Seriously.  I mean, we have the numbers here, exactly how many people have attended.  How many people went to local mom and pop shops in the area?  I can't imagine it was that many.  It's like when Amazon came in and tried to get states to bid on getting them to build their office in their city by offering them the lowest taxes possible.  What a scumbag move, right?  There's got to be a certain point at which it's not even worth it for Amazon to put their building in anymore.  Like, what are they really going to give back if they're not paying, like, anything in taxes?  Honestly, this paycheck protection program thing where Ken Ham got, like, millions and millions of dollars from the PPP loans, at this immediate moment, I could be convinced otherwise, but in my opinion... You shouldn't be given taxpayer money if you're not paying taxes.  There are arguments in favor of it.  Like, for example, if you're a normal nonprofit, like, for example, my nonprofit that I started, Apostate Refuge, if it started suffering at some point in time, would I be entitled to taxpayer funds to stay afloat and keep helping people with it?  I'm not necessarily opposed to people getting taxpayer money like that, but I feel like they should have to prove that they're actually providing some good thing to society.  They can't just claim, yeah, we're a church, so by definition we're providing a good.  We're providing a service to society and it's making it better.  I just think people should have to prove that they're doing something productive and helpful for society to have non-profit status. ",
