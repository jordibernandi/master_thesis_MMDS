            "text": "Some people are starting to have biased remorse for Biden, which I kind of saw this happening.  If you go watch the episode, so that would have been the episode on Monday.  So that was the 25th of... Yeah, 25th of January.  And I was on the News and Why It Matters with Elijah Schaefer and, of course, Sarah Gonzalez.  And we were talking about some of this, how you're seeing people, particularly these union workers that had backed Biden.  that are a tad bit frustrated, rather disagreeing with the idea.  And a lot of it centered around the Keystone Pipeline.  And, you know, they're criticizing him for it because it's killing, of course, all of these jobs.  Some of these are union jobs.  Good paying jobs.  And they didn't read the fine print because this is something that Biden was, I thought, was pretty, pretty clear in terms of his what this new age of the Democratic Party would be ushering in.  That was going to be something that was going to take a hit.  So, for example, we're going to be reading right here.  You can get this article over at The Blaze.  like the United Association of Union Plumbers and Pipefitters.  They endorsed Biden for president in August.  They said, we're not going to sit on the sidelines at the U.A.  This endorsement is about putting U.A.  members to work and fighting for fair wages and good benefits under a Biden administration.  That's exactly what we'll get.  It's coming from Mark Maness, the general president of the United Association, says, let's be real, nobody in the Oval Office will be with us on every single issue, but with his long history of standing shoulders... Sorry about that.  Long history... It says, but with his long history of standing shoulder to shoulder with working families.  And And his commitment to an all the above energy approach that will mean more U.A.  jobs, protecting the hard earned retirements of our members and appointing union friendly judges.  Joe Biden will be a fierce ally to our U.A.  brothers and sisters in the White House.  So y'all know how I feel about these public unions anyway.  They're just political tools.  That's pretty much what they've been.  I know this concept, and certainly the leftists would claim that unions are just the greatest things in the world, and they fight for freedom and fairness in the workplace and all this other nonsense.  But really all it's historically been, and definitely now, especially these damn teachers unions, are... Some of the most corrupt unions and they're just tools for the political elites.  But this week, the United Association of Union Plumbers and Pipefitters condemned the Biden administration, said in revoking this permit, the Biden administration has chosen to listen to the voices of French activists instead of union activists.  union members of the American consumer on day one.  Let me be very clear.  When built with union labor by men and women of the United association pipelines, like Keystone Excel remained the safest and most efficient modes of energy transportation in the world.  Sadly, the Biden administration has now put thousands of union workers out of work.  For the average American family, it means energy costs will go up and communities will no longer see that local investment that comes with the pipeline construction.  And that was the same guy.  So the same guy who was talking about how Biden would be.  back in August, he'd be standing shoulder to shoulder with these working Americans.  Day one, you saw Biden say, yeah, thanks for the support.  No refunds.  Go screw yourself.  Impressive how those Democrats are.  I mean, Joe Biden may have eclipsed because he did it so early.  So he may have eclipsed Bernie even with the whole no refunds.  But yeah, they didn't read the fine print.  And they're frustrated, and rightfully so.  The thing is, and you're seeing all these union workers who have supported him, or not supported union workers, like the actual unions themselves, which is why unions are endorsing candidates.  That is just a... It tells you in itself the issue with unions and how they've been, certainly traditionally.  But obviously, a lot of these unions are going to be tied to these Keystone Pipeline projects, and they got screwed over in that regard.  Now, I'm not here to sit up in dispute with the government contracts.  Should they be involved in any of this?  Of course not.  I'm just talking about how low information people are.  And if you just paid slightly closely, close attention to Biden, you knew this was on the table.  So how guys who could claim to be it definitely when it comes to the traditional methods of energy.  How they could actually claim to be Joe Biden was ever on their side when that was like one of the leading topics, this whole approach to these fringe sort of environmentalists who hate everything traditional in a sense.  Of course, they were going to take an accident.  And if you just slightly paid attention, you would have known that.  But of course, they don't read the fine print.  And I think.  You know, like I mentioned on News and Why It Matters, what it does, it's not just a failure of the system per se, right?  I think that's doing really what it's designed to do.  You can argue that it's designed to fail, but more so what we're dealing with now is how You know, you get a bunch of stupid people who don't read the fine print.  They don't read policies.  They don't read anything.  They don't even know the terms of, you know, words that they use, how to define them.  They don't understand any of that.  It's just a lot of it's doing what they're told, what the popular position is and say what you will about Trump.  But Trump's existence, I won't say he exposed people.  I would say his existence did because they started to tell on themselves how deranged and critically stupid that these people are.  But they get to vote.  They get to vote.  And to see people vote against their own self-interest, like one of those, like I love to watch.  It's tough to watch.  But I do love to watch those like man on the street kind of videos where you'll see people just not even bait questions, right?  Just asking like voters or people that are at protest or things like that.  Just basic stuff about their candidates that they would generally support or the ones that they hate.  they just don't understand like and it's a it's a it's swaps of these big big blocks of people that simply don't know what they're what they're voting for.  they have no idea.  it's just like they're doing what they're told and quite often some of this comes from you know uh groups like unions and and and and politicians and and and entertainers and the people that shouldn't they shouldn't be getting their information from anyway.  but they get their information from, and they just tell them to do something, and they do it.  It's the adopted position of everybody that surrounds them, so they think that it's the allowed opinion.  It reminds me of Twitch.  I can talk about Twitch being a safe haven for leftists from a political side, and most of them don't know what the hell they're talking about.  They're very low information, but when you're in the echo chamber, that's all you know, I believe, and I've talked with other Twitch creators behind the scenes about this, how a lot of these guys, even if they don't agree with where the country's going, even if they don't agree with They wouldn't dare fix their mouths to say it because that's not the acceptable position among their their their echo chamber.  And unfortunately, people adopt positions based on that.  And they will actually go put in a vote that unfortunately impacts you, which is why I say democracy is not good.  I don't even know why, but the fact that it's even put out there as if this is like something that's.  equals freedom.  it's hilarious to me because there's so many stupid people.  but also putting something in like your person in office or something um even if he does what it is that you want him to do does not make that righteous.  just because most of the people that decided to vote supported that person right because that person can be a very evil bad person.  we've seen this over the course of human history and these people violate the rights of natural god-given rights that they have, that other people have because they're control freaks.  And you know, these thought Terrans love to sit up here and wield this power and force people to do things that they otherwise would not do voluntarily.  You see, this is just nothing but another example of this, of people that just don't read the fine print because they don't know what the, I'm not acting like.  I'm just the most, the smartest person ever.  I'm not.  I like to think I'm fairly smart, but I know enough to, you know, if I fix my mouth to say something, or definitely if I'm going to go do something, I'm at least informed on the matter in some capacity.  It makes absolutely no sense for someone, definitely a union that specifically wants This is what they focus on, this industry.  And for them to be completely oblivious to that is, it makes no sense.  But it goes to show how stupid people are. ",
