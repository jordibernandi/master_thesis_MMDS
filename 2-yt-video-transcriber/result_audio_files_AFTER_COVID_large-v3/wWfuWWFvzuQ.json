            "text": "Hi, this is a Skeptical Console with Dr.  Steven Novella.  And on this episode, I'm going to be talking about homeopathy.  I wanted to do a deep dive on a good classic medical pseudoscience, but also this is one that has been cropping up during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Cuba, for example, is promoting a specific homeopathic product for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.  Just so happens that a Cuban pharmaceutical company makes that product.  And India is promoting homeopathy along with Ayurveda and other pseudoscientific medical practices to treat their pandemic.  But that's part of their program to promote Hindu nationalism.  It's definitely an ideological push behind it.  But just regular homeopaths are promoting homeopathic products to treat COVID-19, saying that it can, for example, boost the immune system or that it could act like a vaccine, which is an old homeopathic claim.  Now, none of that is based on science or even reality.  And in fact, many people don't really know what homeopathy is.  So I want to start by just describing exactly what it is, because once you know what a homeopathy really is, you know, it's not herbal medicine or natural treatments, then it becomes clear that it really is, in a word, witchcraft.  It is magical potions.  Now, homeopathy was just invented by Samuel Hahnemann.  It was not based upon any understanding, again, of biology, illness, or disease on any kind of basic science.  He just had an idea.  He had an idea based upon a single anecdotal experience of his own of a substance causing symptoms of the disease that it was meant to treat.  And from that, he came up with the idea of like cures like.  Although this was also based on an older notion.  There is a superstitious notion known as sympathetic magic, that things that look similar or have one similarity will also have a similarity in other properties.  This really is metaphor based, and homeopathy to this day is largely based on metaphor, as you will see, and not based on any kind of reality.  It is magical thinking.  down to its roots.  Now, there is no principle in medicine or biology that would state that a substance which causes certain specific symptoms at high doses will cure diseases which cause those symptoms when you dilute it down to very small doses.  But that brings us to Hahnemann's second law, which he actually developed later on in the course of developing homeopathy, and that is the law of infinitesimals.  Hahnemann came to believe that by diluting substances to an extreme degree, you would actually make them more powerful.  He also developed his own theory of the cause of all illness, miasm theory.  He divided all illnesses up into different types of miasms, and those few miasms were responsible for all disease.  And of course, then you develop a homeopathic treatment against those specific miasms.  Again, if you're treating something which doesn't exist, your treatments themselves are probably not based in reality.  So let's get back to this notion of infinitesimals.  And a lot of people enjoy talking about exactly how small an amount of original substance is left in a typical homeopathic dilution.  Now, if you read a label on a homeopathic product, it will give a number followed by either an X or a C, usually.  There are some other nuances, but those are the main ones.  An X means a 1 to 10 dilution, and a C is a 1 to 100 dilution.  So if you have a 10X dilution, that means a 1 to 10 dilution done 10 times in series.  If you have a 30C solution, that's a 1 to 100 dilution done 30 times in series.  Now, if you do the math, that means you are diluting the original starting substance 10 to the minus 60th times, right?  That's how much you're diluting it, 10 to the minus 60th.  So, to put that into perspective, there are about 10 to the 50th, more or less, atoms in the Earth.  So, if you wanted to have roughly a 50-50 chance of having a single molecule of starting ingredient in a 30C preparation, you would need 10 billion Earths worth of remedy.  That's a lot of drinking to do, right?  You'd have to take a lot of pills or drink a lot of solution in order to get 10 billion Earths worth to give yourself just a 50-50 chance of getting a single molecule.  So that's just a fun way to point out that there's nothing left, right?  There's zero left of the original starting ingredient.  And so how then could it have any plausible effect if it's just water?  Well, homeopaths have various answers to that, but mainly they say that water has memory, right?  Water retains the memory of what was previously diluted in it.  This, of course, raises a lot of questions about everything that's ever been diluted in the water, but then they just say, well, it was reset when you go through the process of doing the homeopathic preparation, whatever.  Again, they're just making it up.  But can water retain the memory of many different kinds of substances that have been diluted in it and gone through the homeopathic preparation process?  No.  Water has no such ability.  And there is no evidence, no scientific study, no reason to think That it does.  Water is a fluid.  The water molecules flow over each other.  Now, there may be some temporary, and when I say temporary, I mean tiny fractions of a second, interactions among the water molecules.  You may see some metastructures, some very fleeting structures occurring for a very brief period of time, less than milliseconds we're talking about here.  not something that will survive for any length of time.  But homeopaths might point to that and go, see, there's water memory.  Nope, I'm sorry, that doesn't amount to water memory.  In fact, it's a lot worse than that.  In order for their claim that water memory is the reason that homeopathic potions work, The water would have to retain some kind of biologically active structural information indefinitely for a long period of time, not just milliseconds.  It would have to hold on to it long enough that it would survive through 30 successive dilutions.  And then oftentimes you might take drops of those and put it on your tongue or you might put it on a sugar pill.  So then it would have to survive being placed on a sugar pill and evaporating.  So it would have to transfer that memory to the sugar pill as well.  Either way, once it gets into your body, then it gets diluted in your stomach acids and gets absorbed into your blood.  The structure would have to survive that as well, and then would have to survive the passage through all of the complex constituents of your blood to get to allegedly where it needs to get in your body to have whatever effect it's having.  Of course, every step of the way of that is impossible.  So it's impossible times 10 for this to have any chance of working.  So we could say with a high degree of scientific certainty that homeopathic potions can't possibly work.  Homeopaths rescue themselves in a couple of ways.  They might say, well, we don't know how it works, but we just know that it does.  Well, no.  Not knowing how something works is different than knowing that it's impossible that it works.  And that's the realm that we're in with homeopathy.  But, you know, they might also say that the homeopathic remedy transfers the essence.  It's not a chemical reaction that's happening.  It's just there's some other kind of property.  The essence of the starting substance is being transferred to the homeopathic potion.  What is essence?  It's just their word for magic, right?  I mean, it's nothing that we know to exist in any way.  They're just making it up.  And so what's the plausibility of homeopathy given that like cures like is based on nothing and the infinitesimal dilutions is based upon nothing?  What's the chance that it works?  Well, nothing.  But let's not neglect the fact, and I think many critics of homeopathy sort of skip over, what is being diluted?  Well, I like to refer to it, most of the homeopathic potions are fairy dust diluted out of existence.  One very common homeopathic product is oscillococcinum.  What's that?  Well, decades ago, a homeopath was looking at slides of diseased tissue and thought that he saw little oscillating organisms that he named oscillococcinum because they oscillated.  It turns out that when he looked at slides of other diseases, he saw them there as well.  And so rather than concluding, like I think a good, well-trained scientist would do, that, well, if I'm seeing these everywhere, they're on every slide of every disease and even healthy tissue, maybe this is some kind of an artifact.  or something that's just there on every slide.  But instead he concluded, aha, I have found the cause of all disease.  Every single human ailment is caused by these oscillating little organisms.  And so he developed a homeopathic preparation of these non-existent air bubbles.  It turns out they were air bubbles in the slides.  They were a complete artifact.  But at some point he observed, oh, there's a lot of these air bubble oscillococcinum in duck liver.  So now homeopaths make dilutions of duck liver.  They call that oscillococcinum and it's used for the flu and for all kinds of infections and viruses and other illnesses.  So really it's something that never existed.  It was an artifact and they dilute that out of existence.  and there you go.  Another very common homeopathic remedy is arsenic or arsenicum.  And that is, it is arsenic, it is a poison.  You don't really have to worry because when they diluted 30C, you're not gonna get a single molecule of it.  But why does that cure so many different things?  Again, it's based upon very fanciful, magical notions of light cures light.  Many homeopaths, and there's different philosophies of homeopathy, just like there are different types of astrology.  They use different methods to decide what treatment to give you, what is the totality of symptoms.  But they include things like their patient's constitution, their emotional outlook, things like that, things that have no bearing on actual illness or disease.  And then they come up with the one treatment, which is usually arsenicum or acilococcinum or whatever, and then that is their remedy.  But my favorite one I have to mention is homeopathic dilutions of pieces of the Berlin Wall.  You read that correctly.  That is correct.  And what does that treat?  Feelings of oppression and similar types of symptom.  Again, it's metaphor, as if the Berlin Wall somehow captured the essence of oppression.  And we're going to homeopathically reproduce that as a remedy for those feelings.  That is what we're dealing with.  So, we could put all that aside, however, and say, all right, fine, it's magic, there's no plausible way that it could work, but maybe they hit upon something and we have no idea what, they haven't, but let's say, let's just look at the clinical evidence in isolation, if we just forget about the plausibility and say, of all of the clinical trials looking at homeopathic potions, especially the good quality ones where you have a double-blind placebo-controlled trial of a homeopathic treatment, does the evidence show that there's actual any effect?  And the answer, unsurprisingly, is no.  There is no effect.  And the totality of this research has been reviewed by multiple organizations, by multiple scientists, and they've come to the same conclusions.  And not homeopaths, of course, but independent scientists.  Here's one from Australia, from the NHMRC in Australia.  They said, based upon the assessment of the evidence of effectiveness of homeopathy, NHMRC concludes there are no health conditions for which there is reliable evidence that homeopathy is effective.  That is a scientific way of saying homeopathy works for nothing.  It is nothing and it works for nothing.  These are independent lines of evidence, both showing that homeopathy is worthless.  And in fact, the British House of Commons reviewed the evidence and they concluded that homeopathy was witchcraft, literal witchcraft, in terms of the rituals that you go through to make it that have no basis in reality and are based in magical thinking.  So in short, I think the best summary of homeopathy is that it is the air guitar of medicine.  There is literally nothing there.
