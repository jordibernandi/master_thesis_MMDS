            "text": "Alright.  First stop in Kauai, Palo Alto.  Super cool beach.  One of the many beaches here at Poipu.  I don't even know which one this is, but there's nobody here.  We're gonna go body surf right now.  Try to go find some fish.  All right, top of the morning, guys.  It's like my third, no, second morning here in Kauai.  Already lost track of time.  Such a different world.  I've never seen the beaches like this on Oahu.  All the debris.  It's cool.  There's a lot of rivers.  It's considered the rainiest island, so you have a lot of the trees get washed off.  The multiple river mouths.  It's really cool.  It's definitely a nice break from the water.  Enjoy the scenery.  All right, gang, we're here at the famous Wailua Falls.  We're going to attempt to hike it.  Yeah, Noah?  He's kind of grumbling about it.  He's like, could we have to put him in his wet board shorts?  But we'll survive because we're going to get wet anyway.  Whoa.  Oh, no kidding.  Look at this, Noah.  Look at this.  Oh, my gosh.  Is it worth it or what?  Look at this.  Just swim right here in this little pond.  Unbelievable.  I'm going to put the drone up right here.  I'm going to see the difference up too high and then right below it.  There we go.  River crossing, no undadding.  There they go.  Woo!  Whoa.  Woo!  How's the wind?  How's the wind up in here?  I'm going to try to ride it down there to him.  No!  No!  A couple little boulders in there.  You just got to keep your feet up and your butt in there.  All right, just got to Hanalei Bay.  Beautiful out here.  It's only the quarter mile.  Start of a call out trail.  He definitely will be back here when my son is older.  To do the full 11 miles in.  22 total miles.  See.  All right, so we're back.  We're down at the beach.  We're going to jump in this water.  How amazing does that look?  What do you think of that, Noah?  What?  This giant tree cave.  It's like Lord of the Flies.  Cool, huh?  Let's go see if we see any fish out there.  We found mountain guavas growing on the trail in Palo Alto.  It's kind of common here on a lot of the hikes.  Papayas are growing naturally on the side of the road.  Awesome.  My dad likes going by waterfall.  All right, we came out to Lydgate Park this morning.  Super nice playground for the kids.  Actually, we just walked over to the fish ponds right now.  And the wood debris is something that maybe I've never seen, only comparably in, say, Costa Rica or something.  And just all the rivers, just like I showed earlier, with all of it.  Look at these piles of wood from the beach.  So it wasn't like this last time you were here?  Unreal.  That's just a lot of flooding.  What's up, mate?  This is Kalama, and we got Captain Noah.  Yeah, we got swords galore.  Swords galore.  That is so true.  What?  What?  What?  Yeah, I think this is the winner so far.  Just got the hideaways.  It's not really a secret, but.  Pretty cool little hike down kid friendly.  No, where are we?  Calia Beach.  Oh, so what do we got here?  Show us.  We got this nice fort.  We got a nice view of the surf.  Mommy's out there.  We got some sea grapes.  Got some coconut.  Look like somebody already got this one, though.  Somebody got to drill the hole out of that one.  So, Noah, how long did it take you to set this guy up?  Three days.  Three days?  Five hours.  Five hours?  I think more like 30 minutes.  Maybe 45.  By the time we gathered up all the wood.  A hundred hours.  Okay.  It's a good little activity for you on the beach here.  And there's tons of driftwood, as you can see over there.  There comes Mama Duke's.  I don't need her.  Woo! ",
