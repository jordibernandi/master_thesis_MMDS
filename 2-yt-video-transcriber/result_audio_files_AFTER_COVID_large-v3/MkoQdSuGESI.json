Just to refresh your memory, when we last left him, he was countering Hitchin's argument, which suggests that a design that has 99% of all of its animals going extinct looks like a bad design.  And Kokel brought up the fact that we don't use buggy whips anymore and buggy whips are designed.  Therefore, it's OK that 99% of the animals that God designed were failures.  Anyway, let's see where he goes from here.  I mean, the designer also designed the environment, so yeah, it is.  Not that this argument is really that great of an argument, but Kokel's answer to it is kind of weak, to say the least. ",

Well, the whole fine tuning argument boils down to.  the constants of the universe are such that life was able to develop and evolve.  Therefore, someone made the constants that way.  So I just want to point out that the fine tuning argument at its base is inherently supportive of the theory of evolution. ",

But let's actually look at the transcript from that discussion, which is available on Greg's website, and see if that really was such a gotcha for Michael Shermer.  The question, as posed by Shermer, was in the context of an analogy where Shermer mentions the idea that we find out scientifically that life did not originate on Earth.  We were seeded here by aliens from a planet around the star Vega.  Okay, so we want to know where the Vegans came from.  Who made them?  Did they evolve, or were they seeded from somewhere else, or did God do it?  In other words, at some point, we need some natural explanation for where life came from.  And if you take this back far enough, you'll end up at an infinite regress.  Well, God, outside of space and time, came into our space and time, stirred the particles, and created it.  Okay.  But where did, if not God, the intelligent designer, where did he come from?  Did he evolve, or is he a standalone, last causal link?  And there we bump up against the great unknown.  I don't see how that is resolvable.  To which Greg replied pretty much verbatim what he just said here, followed by Shermer replying that it's actually a really interesting question because we don't know where the universe came from in the first place.  Even if we use the multiverse as an explanation, we still don't know where the multiverse came from.  Eventually, no matter what explanation we favor, we end up bumping into the limitations of our knowledge.  And with our current knowledge, there is no definitive explanation one way or the other. ",

And the arguments that are used to insist that an agency is needed in order for life and the universe to exist, when applied to that agency, also conclude that an agency is needed in order for that agency to exist.  The only way out of this is special pleading.  Well, those arguments don't apply to God because reasons.  So which is more likely, that someone or something created the God that you believe in, or that humans used flawed arguments to get to God in the first place?  The fact that humans regularly see design where there isn't any is good evidence that the intuitive appearance of design is not actually evidence for a designer. ",

It is their job to support their proposition.  If they are unable to adequately support their proposition, I have no obligation to accept it.  This is soft atheism, agnostic atheism, if you will, atheism that doesn't make claims, but simply lacks belief, sometimes referred to in a derogatory manner as lack theism.  This is where I stand on the general God claim.  But if you want me to, I can make a case against the God of the Bible, because the thing about deism is that it's very nebulous.  It's pretty well completely unfalsifiable.  No evidence presented could possibly definitively prove it wrong.  The reason for this is that there are really no claims made about a deistic God.  It's just the power behind the starting of the universe.  But the more claims you make about a God, the more falsifiable it becomes.  You can't disprove deism because a deistic God has no definite characteristics.  But the Christian God is given several characteristics throughout the Bible.  Now, of course, Christians like to wiggle around in their interpretations of these different characteristics in order to escape their contradictory nature.  But my point is that I can actively argue against the proposition that the God of the Bible exists, where I couldn't argue against the existence of a deistic God. ",

And sometimes it gets phrased in a way that it's not an assertion.  It'll be along the lines of whatever begins to exist had a cause.  OK, so if we dismiss the Hartle-Hawking state for now and just agree that the universe had a beginning, then we can agree that the universe had a cause with this argument.  But this doesn't even get you to a deistic God.  It only gets you to a cause.  The cause being God is 100% assumption.  So what is the cause?  I don't know.  And neither do you, no matter how vehemently you assert that it was God.  Will Greg actually make an argument for God?  Will he manage to tie that argument to the specific God that he believes in?
