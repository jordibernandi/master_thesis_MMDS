Make sure y'all stay tuned because it's probably going to get fun.  Security van scoping us out.  Yeah, come on down here big boy.  We're filming.  What's your name?  I can't hear very good.  Why are you guys filming?  What?  What are you guys filming for?  A story on the correction officers of the state?  Some corruption and stuff that we heard about?  No.  How do you know?  I said, no, they're not.  Oh, yes, we are.  I think he was told him to get back on their property.  What?  I think they asked before he started backing up, they said, whose property are they on?  Are they on our property?  And he said, no.  And if I'm not mistaken, she said, you need to get back on our property or something. ",

Probably so, yeah.  Damn.  Damn.  Yep.  Here we go.  One last.  No lies, Mr.  Jones.  We got it all on film.  Let's go over here.  Ah.  Hey guys, we're at Johnson Correctional Institute in Smithfield, North Carolina.  This is a deputy right here from Johnson County.  Warden Jones is right there in the suit and tie.  Called the police on us for being out here on the side of the damn road.  Let me see if I can unzoom this thing.  There we go.  Yeah, we out here on the side of the road.  There's a prison.  Christian Institute over there.  That's a security guard.  Don't know that name.  Don't care.  But he's out here bossing us around trying to give orders.  And as y'all know me, I didn't take kindly to that.  So I gave him a few choice words.  You know how I do.  So this might get hairy here in a minute.  So make sure y'all tell everybody.  Share this link.  It might get stupid.  Just saying.  Y'all just hang out, man, because he just showed up, man.  And it was pretty fast, too.  I don't see any backup yet.  How y'all doing?  What's that?  I said how are y'all doing?  I'm doing great, man.  What's up?  I can't. ",
