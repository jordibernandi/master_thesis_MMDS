I mean it's kind of hard not to be fascinated by someone who sees UFOs and spirits and pretty much everything she ever looks at.  But what we're gonna look at today surprised even me, despite how accustomed I am to her kind of thinking from watching so many of her videos.  We're gonna look at a couple videos, maybe three videos, we'll see how it goes.  All of which demonstrate the interesting ways she has of consuming fictional media.  Most of us would look at something like The Lord of the Rings and think, here's a totally fictional novel, based somewhat on various mythologies and bits of history.  But Gina's not most of us.  So this video is called, What Was Pangea? ",

It probably got a lot more than that, but the channel that hosted it is terminated for violating YouTube's policy on hate speech, which I personally don't put a lot of stock in.  I mean, the last video I published was demonetized for hate speech.  And that was confirmed by Human Review, and I think any honest human who actually watches it would conclude that's not true.  Anyway, this is a video I've had sent to me a few times that I've skimmed through but never actually watched the whole thing, and I've just never got around to actually responding to it.  But basically the idea is there's structures like this one, the Devil's Tower, that are made of rock, but hey, maybe it looks kinda like a tree, kinda.  And therefore it is a tree!  And the real ancient trees were these giant things, not these puny little things that we have now.  You know, just a lot of looking at pictures and making up stories that sound good.  At least that's what it seems like from what I have seen.  There might be more to the video than that, but I haven't seen it personally.  Anyway, apparently Gina buys into it.  I know, it's absolutely shocking.  It came totally out of the blue. ",

The first sources of light for all of Arda were two enormous lamps.  Illuin, the silver one to the north, and Ormul, the gordon, golden one to the south.  These were cast down and destroyed by Melkor.  Afterwards, the Valar went to Valinor, and Yavanna sang into existence the two trees, silver Telpirion and golden Lorelin.  Telpirion was considered male, and Lorelin female.  The trees set on the hill Ezelahar, located outside Valimar.  Each tree was a source of light, Telperion's silver and Lorelin's gold.  Uh, one day lasted twelve hours.  Each tree, in turn, would give off light for seven hours, waxing to full brightness and then slowly waning again, so that at one hour each of dawn and dusk, soft gold and silver light would be given off together.  Uh, and then they destroyed the trees.  Again, Yavanna sang and Nienna wept, but they succeeded only in reviving Telperion's last flower to become the moon and Lorelin's last fruit to become the sun.  Yeah, so there you go.  Ultimately, it's a creation myth for the moon and the sun.  And that'd be why there's two of them.  Final answer. ",
