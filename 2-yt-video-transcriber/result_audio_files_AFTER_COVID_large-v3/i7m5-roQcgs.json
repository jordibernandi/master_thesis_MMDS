            "text": "Well, it's Tuesday, June 16th, year of our Lord 2020, and you are still not crazy.  Yeah, you know, I feel like sometimes people need positive affirmations when in times of upheaval and a little bit of disorientation.  Seriously, you're seeing what you're seeing.  You're seeing your big evil leaders say the things that you see them saying.  You're not crazy.  You haven't gone crazy overnight.  I've been there, man.  Trust me.  You're not crazy.  Psalm 55 is a great psalm for our time.  Psalm 55, I think you would do well to read it to yourself and to pray to God.  regarding Psalm 55.  The New King James Version calls this, \"...trust in God concerning the treachery of  friends.\".  And this is kind of what a lot of us are feeling right now.  Because we see our friends, we see our leaders, people that we've respected over years.  And nobody's saying you can't respect them anymore.  But what we're saying is, how is it that they're saying the things that they're saying?  It sounds so twisted, right?  It's like, how is this happening?  So I would recommend Psalm 55 to you.  But here's a section of it.  And I want you to really hear this.  He says, he has put forth his hand against those who are at peace with him.  He has broken his covenant.  The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was in his heart.  His words were softer than oil, yet they were drawn swords.  And so this idea that his words are smooth and soft, they sound so good, but really it's about war and hatred and treachery.  Like you can't be tricked by smooth sounding words.  And I think sometimes we read a passage like that and we feel like it'd be very easy to detect the smooth sounding words.  We kind of think of like that creepy guy at the party who's like smooth talking the lady, but he's really bad at it.  He's really pathetic.  He's just sleazy.  And it's just obviously sleazy.  And I don't think that's the way the psalm presents this.  I think when it says his words are smooth like butter, it doesn't mean it's going to be very easily identifiable as sleazy.  He's very convincing.  It sounds really good.  It sounds like something you'd want to affirm.  But you have to think twice because those words are actually war in his heart.  Those words, they sound good, but they're drawn swords.  He wants to go to war.  He wants revolution.  He wants peace.  He wants division, really, is what he wants.  Chances are that if you're new to the social justice controversy, or even if you're not, you've heard of Jamar Tisby.  He is the it boy right now.  There's no question about that.  He's the it boy.  Sorry about that.  My son didn't know I was recording.  But anyway, so Jamar Tisby, right?  His words sound so good.  They sound so good to people.  And a lot of you right now are probably thinking in your own minds, like, they sound good, but there's something off about them.  And you're not crazy.  There is something off about them.  Jamar Tisby is... One of these, that his words sound good, but there's war in his heart.  He wants division.  He is not for the people of God.  He's against the people of God.  This is one of those friends that you had.  that's really about treachery.  Listen to this.  He links to one of his own articles here.  And here's what he says about his own article.  We're going to go into it a little bit.  He says this piece has some helpful personal application, but we should also extend the concept of, quote, intent versus impact to policies.  How do the policies we support help or harm groups such as black people, other POCs and the poor in terms of actual outcomes?  And so the idea here is that we should think about the policies we support, you know, the laws that we support, the political policies, and think not really about what the intent of the policy is, but rather we should think of how it actually impacts black people or other POC groups or the poor.  That's how we should decide what policies we should support.  And he links to this article.  Let me show you how this article starts.  Listen to this for a second.  He says, once when my son was a toddler, he drew on the wall with a crayon and made a mess.  When I confronted the perpetrator about his offense, he couldn't understand why I was upset.  He had, after all, intended to draw a pretty picture to please his father.  His intent was not to cause damage.  In fact, it was the opposite.  He wanted to do something nice.  But that's not really the point, though.  The fact that his actions resulted in a mess that had to be cleaned up.  While my son focused on what he meant by his actions, I focused on what he actually did.  Intentions matter, but the entire conversation changes when we talk about impact.  And this is true.  You could have good intentions but actually have a bad impact depending on the kinds of things you support.  In fact, this is my entire claim of many social justice advocates.  They want to do the right thing, but actually the things that they support are vile and wicked and evil.  we're going to talk about how we know that in a minute.  so here's what he says later in this article.  this is actually not good or not bad at all.  he says we need to make the same distinctions.  the bible does.  he says.  the bible sets a precedent for distinguishing between intent and impact.  If someone is in the forest with his neighbor cutting wood and his axe head flies off and accidentally kills his companion then the offender may flee to a city of refuge to avoid death.  The reason the killer can live is that the man did not deserve to die since he had not hated his neighbor in the past.  This is very true.  Since the man had no malice or forethought in the act that led to his neighbor's death, he did not deserve a fatal punishment.  On the other hand, if anyone hates his neighbor and lies in wait for him and attacks him and strikes him fatally so that he dies, your eyes shall not pity him, but you shall purge the guilt of innocent blood from Israel.  A person who plans evil earns a different punishment.  Motives matter.  So here's the point.  So I would agree with all of this.  Like, if you are lying in wait, you're trying to kill someone, you hate him, you want to kill him, that's very different than an accidental killing or like a negligent killing.  Like you're just, you know, both chopping wood and one of you accidentally gets hit with the ax head.  You didn't mean to do it.  So you're not guilty of murder there.  That wasn't the point of the act.  And that's very true.  God does make that distinction.  And so we also have to make that distinction, right?  Yeah.  But listen to what he says here.  He knows what's what, and then listen to what he says.  He says, But lack of malice does not remove the harm done or the need for restitution.  In another biblical example, after giving instructions for all kinds of rituals, God makes a final provision for anyone who unintentionally breaks the law.  Numbers 15 says, If just one person sins unintentionally, that person must bring a year-old female goat for a sin offering.  He says, notice that the transgression is still called a sin despite the unintentional nature of the act, and the person must still bring a sin offering to make atonement.  And so this is very true because when somebody, like in the example with the axe head and stuff like that, There was something that happened there.  Maybe there was a negligence.  Maybe there was something there.  So like the wrong still needs to be righted, although we have to consider all the facts.  Was there intent?  Was it murder?  Was it manslaughter?  Was it just an accident?  Like we have to consider all of that to know what should happen in that case.  It all matters.  That's very true.  So Jamar sounds like he's making a lot of sense here.  But listen to how he ties this all up in a bow, because this is how false teachers operate.  They mix truth with lies.  I'm not saying this whole article is terrible, but listen to how he wraps this up.  He says, But go further.  consider the impact on the offended party.  if one member suffers all suffer together which is a bible verse.  think of the long history of african-american suffering in the united states and the countless instances when black pain was minimized or ignored determined to break the pattern of self-justification by elevating empathy over indignation.  Only when our love for unity outpaces our love for self will we create opportunities for racial reconciliation.  And so you can see what Jamar takes with one hand or gives with one hand, he takes with the other.  Because on the one hand, he's telling you, you know, the facts of the situation actually matter.  You know, whether or not somebody intended to murder someone, it actually makes \u2013 it changes how you would punish the situation, how you would address the situation.  Now, some kind of atonement still needs to be made, but the atonement is different is what Jamar says.  But then he says the next time a race-related event happens \u2013 Then what you want to do is you want to elevate empathy over indignation.  So he's kind of saying, well, but you can't really trust yourself here.  You've got to just go with what you please empathize with blacks and go with what we say is the situation.  Now, notice here, there's so many assumptions that are being made.  A race related event.  Does this mean any event that involves one or more races?  Because that's kind of what he wants to say here because this is all coming into light in the context of Derek Chauvin and George Floyd.  That's where he's bringing this article back up into the forefront, right?  And so was that a race-related event?  Well, the facts of the matter is we don't know yet.  But what he's saying here is, listen, you just got to understand there's a history here.  Black people have experienced this pain for years, and so you have to empathize with us.  Get into the pain with us.  Believe our perspective here.  Even though I just told you all this nice sounding stuff about how God makes a distinction between intent and impact and we should too.  I told you all this nice sounding true stuff.  But when it actually comes around to what \u2013 in reality what happens, then I actually really don't want you to do that.  I really don't want you to do that.  In fact, I want you to join the lynch mob with me regarding Derek Chauvin.  You see \u2013 These words sound so smooth, right?  They sound so smooth.  I mean, how could someone be against this?  He says, determined to break the pattern of self-justification by elevating empathy over indignation.  Like, who wouldn't want to elevate empathy over indignation?  You see, these are smooth words that have an evil intent.  They're smooth words that want you to love your black and brown brother and sister in Christ over and against Derek Chauvin or white people in general.  really is what it is.  You see, this is the issue here.  Like, Jamar Tisby is a perfect example for someone who has words that are smooth like butter, but there's war in his heart.  He tells you he wants you to follow God's law, the intent over impact, but then when it really comes down to it, he doesn't actually want that.  So is this how we do this, right?  Because this sounds good.  Should we consider how policies impact certain people groups before we decide to support them?  I would argue that that's textbook partiality.  That's the opposite of what we should do.  We should not consider how a law will impact poor people or POCs or black people or whatever the group you want to say.  That's not how we decide.  what is just, right?  Like that's partiality.  God says over and over and over and over again, you shall not show partiality because there is no partiality with God.  There's one law.  This is an important thing.  This is no small thing.  There's one law for the native born.  There's one law for the sojourner.  There's one law for blacks.  There's one law for whites.  It's the same law.  There is only one way to decide what is actually a just policy.  And that is, does it comport with the general equity, the general principles, the morality of God's law?  That's how we do this.  So here's an example.  The law against murder, right?  Is murder wrong?  We know that murder is wrong.  The scripture says murder is wrong.  The scripture says how we should adjudicate murders.  We should have two or more witnesses, and then the murderer, if convicted on the evidence of two or more witnesses, ought to be given the death penalty, right?  So does it matter whether or not the proportions say that there are more black murder convictions out there than white?  Is that something that matters?  So do we have to consider that before we decide whether or not murder should be illegal?  Same thing with abortion.  Do we need to consider that whether or not abortion should be illegal?  First, we've got to consider how does this affect poor people and POCs?  Is that how we decide what's what?  Same thing with drug laws.  You see, drug laws, for example, that's a very controversial topic in Christianity.  Are drug laws biblical or not?  I tend to fall on the side of that.  most drug laws aren't biblical.  I understand the arguments for drug laws.  I get it.  But that's where I stand, just so you know.  But here's how I didn't get there.  I definitely didn't get there by saying, drug laws impact blacks more than they impact whites or Latinos, and therefore drug laws are unjust.  That's partiality, man.  Like, that's textbook partiality.  You don't decide how a law impacts a certain people group before you decide whether that law is good or bad.  Dad, I want to pull the... Hot Wheels track out.  In a minute, buddy.  Sorry about that.  My kids are... They have a lot of requests today.  Anyway, that's textbook partiality.  That's not how we do this.  And so you see that this sounds good to a lot of people.  Like, well, who wouldn't want to consider how it impacts blacks and POCs and poor when we decide what policies to support?  But actually, this is upside down.  This is actually anti-Christ.  This is actually anti-biblical.  This is the opposite of what the Bible says you should do.  No.  Instead, when we're deciding what's just and what's right and what's good, what we should do is \u2013 Say, how well does this comport with the general equity, the general principles of the law of God?  It's not a one-to-one transaction so often.  Like with murder, it is.  Like the Bible says murder should be illegal.  Murder should be illegal.  Sometimes it's a little more complicated than that.  So we need to do some work to figure that out.  But what we definitely do not do.  is show partiality to poor people or black people or POCs or whites or whoever when we're deciding what laws are good laws and what laws are unjust laws.  Jamar Tisby is embodying the friend in Psalm 55.  His word sounds smooth as butter, but there's war in his heart.  His words are softer than oil, but they're drawn swords.  This man is at war with what the scripture says regarding justice.  He hates it, and he wants you to join him in hating it as well.  I urge you to read his stuff.  Follow him on Twitter.  Twitter is where he usually goes the most crazy, but follow him.  You will be able to see the upside-down universe that Jamar Tisby lives in so clearly by just following him.  And so that's what I would recommend.  Go ahead and read his book.  Go ahead and follow him.  Go ahead and read his articles and stuff like that.  You will see again and again and again and again how he overturns the law of God and then insists that you do it as well, lest you be a racist.  Don't consent.  Don't bow the knee.  Don't join Jamar Tisby in his rebellion against the Scripture and against the Lord of Glory.  Anyway, I hope you found this video helpful.  If you have any questions about Jamar Tisby or maybe you want to send me an article that you want me to review, feel free to do it.  And I will consider.  I can't promise I'll always do it, but I definitely will consider.  Also, check out my YouTube channel for other Jamar Tisby content because there is quite a bit.  I hope you found this video helpful.  God bless.  One more thing about this.  Somebody responded, and I think there are some good intentions of this response, but ultimately it kind of misses the mark.  Responded to Jamar Tisby saying, you know, we should decide on what policies and laws to support based on how they affect black people, essentially.  And he responded, no, we should look at how the policies we support help or harm people, period.  It's kind of like the All Lives Matter response.  And actually, that's not how it is at all.  You see, our laws, we don't decide how it helps people or how it helps human flourishing because that can be a very subjective thing because some people will argue that homosexuality and LGBT being totally fine, the law of the land promoted in our schools, all that stuff helps human flourishing.  That's actually not how we do this.  In fact \u2013 The only way to know if what you're doing is just or unjust is to figure out how well it comports to the law of God.  We have a big book of law in the Scripture.  And again, it's not a one-to-one thing all the time.  I don't think that Deuteronomy should replace the Constitution like one-to-one like that.  But the general equity of God's law is perfect.  And if we stick with the general equity of God's law, we will be doing well.  When we stray from it and try to figure out things in a pragmatic way, that's when we always find ourselves in trouble.  So, no, it's not about policies, how well policies support all people.  That's an impossible equation to figure out.  Instead, what we've got to do is look at the laws and the case law and the scripture and build a law system and policies that match that as closely as possible.  That's the only way forward. ",
