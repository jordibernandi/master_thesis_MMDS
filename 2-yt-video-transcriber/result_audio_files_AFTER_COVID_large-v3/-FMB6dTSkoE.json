Everyone in this country knows our debate Would go as weakly as you.  You claim you're very confident in your mental state.  Don't you wanna compare IQs?  Won't you debate me?  Some people are saying that you think you can evade me.  I won't debate But everyone I've talked to thinks that you should be ashamed.  Don't go home and rehearse with your geriatric nurse.  Stop being so risk averse and get up on stage with me.  Why won't you debate me?  I just wanna talk.  Why won't you debate me? ",

Honestly, I'm frightened.  I wish someone would hold my hand.  I'm not a madman.  I just have trouble thinking why would they make me the front man? ",
