            "text": "Hey everyone, for this video I'm going to be talking about Ricky Gervais.  Coming from a working class background, Gervais began his career in the 80s as the frontman of the ridiculous new wave band Siona Dancing, and then continued his comedy career by transitioning to hosting talk shows.  Soon after, Gervais achieved massive fame when he created the wildly popular YouTube channel, The Office.  This was preceded by the similarly dry, cringe-heavy shows The Office and Extras.  Jettisoned into stardom by the success of these shows, Gervais went on to make a podcast called The Ricky Gervais Show with friends Carl... Why is every British person's name impossible to say?  Friends Carl Pilkington and Stephen Merchant, which was pretty funny.  And a bunch of movies, TV shows, and stand-up specials, which were pretty not.  When it comes to stand-up specifically, I think Ricky's shortcomings are most clearly visible in his best special, Talking Funny.  Talking Funny is a film conversation between Louis  C.K.,  Jerry Seinfeld, Chris Rock, and inexplicably Ricky Gervais, in which they discuss things like their personal approaches and philosophies to comedy, as well as the ethics of game journalism.  All the negative things we think about black people.  This fucker.  You're saying I'm arrogant?  Yes, you are the most arrogant fucking white man I have ever... ",

Also two of your cool friends are sexual predators.  Anyway, outside of comedy, Ricky is a massive animal rights advocate.  He was a major advocate for gay marriage in the UK.  He also defended JK Rowling's mask off turf tweet.  He has also spent several comedy specials and award ceremonies dead naming and misgendering trans people, as well as identifying as an attack helicopter.  And religiously, he is a devout Muslim.  I have to fact check that.  Some people are saying that he's an atheist, but I don't really know.  He doesn't really talk about religion very much.

Since I'm under the age of 50, I didn't actually watch the Golden Globes on TV.  Instead, I just found out about Ricky's monologue via Twitter.

So like, not only is there all the classic conservative douchebag window dressing in the background, but his channel is literally sponsored by a company that sells MRE rations to doomsday preppers.  But as my mother always said, never judge a controversial monologue by the horrible men who vlog about it in their cars.  My mom is horrifyingly online.  So let's watch the speech for ourselves and see what we think of it.  The first thing that you notice is that it's impossible to find a full version of the speech because everyone either cut it up or just played the audio over top of the same one still frame of Ricky Gervais cumming himself.  The first thing that we notice is that it's funny.  There are a couple of weak spots.  I did find the opening pretty cringy with how he goes on about how edgy he's about to be. ",

            "text": "Apple CEO Tim Cook was there in the audience because Apple has now entered the entertainment industry.  And so Ricky just went straight for the jugular there, sort of his initiation, Apple's initiation to this.  So he said about the Apple Corporation, Apple roared into the TV game with The Morning Show, which is a superb drama about the importance of dignity and doing the right thing, made by a company that runs sweatshops in China, okay?

Now, there are a couple responses that I could imagine coming from people who disagree with me and are for some reason still watching this, which, hey, I appreciate you guys.  So many people only watch the first two minutes of these videos before angrily writing a comment that will one day be used as evidence in a murder trial.  But I work somewhat hard on these videos.  If you're gonna disagree with me, the absolute least that you could do is watch to the end, like, subscribe, hit that bell, become a top-tier patron, and then leave a comment telling me to kill myself.  Anyways, one objection I could see is that everyone's hypocritical at times.  You know, we're all human.  You can't just dismiss anyone who's ever contradicted themselves.  To which I say, fucking watch me.  But if you feel that way, fine, that's fair.  But in that case, what's so brave about what Ricky Gervais did calling out hypocrisy?  if everyone's hypocritical?  Another response is that Ricky Gervais knows that he's full of shit.  You know, he's self-aware.  He gets it.  He's just, as the Brits say, taking a piss.  Now, I definitely do not personally know Ricky Gervais, and I'm happy to be corrected here, but... He doesn't strike me as the most self-aware dude in the world, but I'm definitely being kind of a dick here.  And honestly, I think a more interesting question is, what if Ricky is aware of all of this?  What does that say then?  Sorry, that's coronavirus.  In an episode of the podcast Citations Needed, they make a good point about how pointless the type of hypocrisy takedowns you see on shows like The Daily Show actually are.  While yes, it's bad to be hypocritical, it's kind of meaningless to show that someone contradicted themselves if you aren't willing to say which stance was right and which was wrong.  Without taking that stance and making that critique, you're just left with pointless cynicism.  It all feels very South Park.  People always say that Trey Parker and Matt Stone are these brilliant political critics, while all their message really amounts to is just caring about things makes you a loser.  And I don't want to be a loser.  I want to win.  And that's the message in Ricky's speech, too.  He's not calling these celebrities out so that they'll do better.  He's calling them out because trying to do better makes you a sucker.  So don't try.  And if that's the alternative, I'll take lame grandstanding over nihilism.  Oh, again.  Oh, again.  Hey everyone, thanks for watching.  Sorry for getting all lame and sincere at the end.  If you like this video, please consider liking, commenting, subscribing, hitting the bell, and becoming a patron.  Speaking of patrons, big thank you to all of mine who help me do what I'm doing right now.  Especially thank you to Beth Solman, Brett Long, Comrade Sy, Isokun, Jacqueline E. Gothar, John Price, JP Varee, Mr.  Awesome Be Cool, Stacy Solano, and Will Jarvis.  Big thank you to Will Jarvis for his help making the great music that you were listening to.  For, like, the second half, Will is not Tay Keith, but he still fucks people up.  Thanks so much, and peace.  Again and over again. ",
