And as you're going to see, I mean, when it comes to Cornel West... I could listen to him talk all day.  And in fact, this entire clip is about 10 minutes long.  I've split it into two different parts.  So the first part is about, I think, seven minutes, and then you'll get the rest of it.  But I haven't even seen CNN post this yet on YouTube.  So I feel like it's important to really play this out and just absorb what Cornel West here is saying. ",

            "text": "It was a heavy day, my brother.  And yet I was buoyed up because I saw in the hearts and minds and souls, not just of the Floyd family, but of the church, of the music, the preaching.  A love, not one reference to hatred or revenge.  It was all about love and justice.  It's in the great tradition of the best of Black people, a people who have been hated chronically, systemically for 400 years, but have taught the world so much about love and how to love.  You saw John Coltrane's Love Supreme.  in that church service.  You saw the love of the children of Marvin Gaye's What's Going On and Toni Morrison's Beloved.  You saw Mama Raisin in the Sun of Lorraine Hansberry.  White America ought to give Black people a standing ovation that after 400 years of being terrorized, we refuse to create a Black version of the Ku Klux Klan.  After 400 years of being traumatized, we want to dish out healers.  That's Frederick Douglass.  That's Martin King.  That's Curtis Mayfield.  That's Fannie Lou Hamer.  What is it about these black people?  So thoroughly subjugated, but want freedom for everybody.  That's a grand gift to the world right in the bowels at the center of American empire that is enslaved.  Jim Crow, Jane Crow, lynched them, still dishing out these love warriors.  That's what I saw in the Floyd family.  And I was buoyed up.  It reminded me of the West family.  It reminded me of Irene and Cliff and Cliff and Cynthia and Cheryl.  That's where we come from.  Shiloh Baptist Church.  You can put us down, but you're not going to put us down in such a way that we're going to hate you because you become the point of reference.  No, we're going to put a smile on Larcenia's face.  That's his mama.  That's where he is right now.  He whose way of engaging the world was embracing it with all the love.  Now, I'm not saying we don't have black thugs and gangsters.  I'm talking about the best of our tradition, because brother, brother, brother, if we had created a black version of the Ku Klux Klan, there'd been a civil war every generation with terrorist cells in every hood.  And that's what Brother Trump needs to understand, because it looks like he's trying to push us to the race war.  But the good news is, if there was a race war, we got a whole lot of white brothers and sisters on our side now.  That makes a big difference.  And we got black folk and red folk and indigenous peoples and Asians and so forth.  This is a matter of integrity and honesty, a matter of justice and love.  They kept it on the high ground.  That was a beautiful thing.  But I did break though, brother, when I saw those brothers marching in like the ushers in Shiloh Baptist Church and pick up that coffin and go and walk out.  My daughter was there.  Couldn't take it, man.  I've been at this for over 50 years.  And yet, I got to bounce back.  And I will bounce back, because we got a love that the world can't take away.  The world, white supremacy may make being Black a crime, but we refuse to get in the gutter.  We gonna go down swinging like Ella Fitzgerald, Muhammad Ali, in the name of love and justice.  We doing it for Brother Wyatt.  We're doing it for my daughter.  We're doing it for the Asians.  We're doing it for the whole world because that's the only hope of the world.  And that kind of love is always tragic, comic and cruciform.  You got to get ready to get crucified with that kind of love.  And yet you keep dishing it on generation after generation after generation.  The Floyd family lifted up that spiritual moral banner.  In the midst of a moment in which we got all these lies and crimes, be it Pentagon, the Pentagon or Wall Street or White House or even Congress itself, we know they don't represent the best of this country.  It's just that the best of this country right now seems to be so powerless, but in the streets of the of our nation, we see this multi-racial, multi-cultural, multi-gendered, different sexual orientations, different religions, Jewish brothers and sisters holding up Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel, the Catholics holding up Dorothy Day, the Protestants holding up William Coffin and Lydia Maria Child and the agnostics and the others holding up the Norman Thomases and the Edward Zaids and others.  That was my mixed wrestling with what I saw today, my brother.  And I think we've got hope in the form of motion, but we gotta get ready for the backlash.  We gotta get ready for the neo-fascist clamp down because it's coming.  It is coming. ",

And we must have an analysis of power that's honest.  in terms of the greed, especially at the top, in terms of the hatred running amok, in terms of the corruption, not just White House Congress, too many churches, too many mosques, too many synagogues, too many universities, too many civic associations, and then the greed in us.

            "text": "All right.  I got another clip coming up.  How do I follow that?  I mean, really?  I have a few points here of things I want to touch on that Cornel West discussed, but man, I can't follow that.  Nobody can follow that.  First, your credit to Anderson Cooper for actually having Cornel West on again.  Cornel West has been on Cooper's show a number of times now.  And every time Cornel West comes on, it's like this.  It is just... I mean, it is an education, is what it is.  And he needs to be on more often.  But... So, a few things here stood out to me.  First here, Cornel West mentions how... I mean, this is kind of an offhand remark to everything else he was saying, but this really... It hit me in a weird way.  He said, I've been at this for over 50 years and I have to bounce back.  So I think a lot of us, I mean, at least speaking for myself, it's really easy to get down and depressed and at times just feel hopeless and want to give up.  But I've I've been involved.  I mean, I've been into politics involved in this covering this for I mean, covering it for real for about four years, following it for maybe 10 years.  I mean, this is like my audience is largely younger around my age.  Most of you have not been involved in this for 50 years.  You have not been fighting this fight for 50 years.  And to see someone here like Cornel West, who's been in this fight for that long and continues to have this sort of passion and this real energy and hope.  I mean, for me, out of almost anything here, it really, it stands out as a symbol of of what we should all strive to be.  We should all strive to have this energy, have this hope, this desire to continue to want to make this world better, make society better for all of us.  You see someone here like Cornel West, who's been at this for as long as he has, still fighting this fight.  I mean, this is the reason that the rest of us are still in this, is because of people like Cornel West, who have held it down for this long.  We're fighting these fights when there is nobody on their side.  And now we are seeing this real movement in the streets and potentially, I mean, really the start of a transformative moment in terms of what can happen going forward.  So, yeah, that stood out to me.  Cornel West, of course, mentioning how the black community keeps dishing out these healers, despite the fact that they've been held down for hundreds of years, held down and abused for hundreds of years and still dishing out these healers.  The funeral focus was all about love and justice.  I mean, if you really sit and think about what black people have gone through, what their ancestors have gone through, what they have gone through themselves.  for over 400 years and sit with that and absorb the fact that despite all of that, what comes out of moments like this is love and a desire to make the world better.  I mean, how does that not move you?  And Cornel West, I mean, I really can't add anything else there.  He laid it out.  And then, of course, bringing it all back to the fact that we see the power in Wall Street, the White House, Congress, while the best of the country appears to be powerless, the ones in the streets, but that is really just the beginning of this and how people like Anderson Cooper or like anybody really watching this We feel during moments like this because we care.  We actually care to make things better.  And That really is, for me, I mean, Cornel West here points out that the best of us, meaning the best of us, the people that care, is the best of us.  The best of us are, you know, the wealthiest, aren't the well-connected.  The best of us are the people that actually feel and care and are doing something and are getting involved, whether it's educating your friends and family, whether it's being in the streets, whatever you're doing.  getting involved to make this society better.  The best of us are the ones that care.  So I think being able to reframe how we view success in life as not who has the money, not who has the most power, but who actually fights for everyday individuals.  If we can reframe success as that, I think that is really how we push forward into a world that isn't focused on wealth, but is focused on the collective, focused on all of us succeeding.  Now, of course, last clip here.  This one's a little shorter, but still, as always, when it comes to Cornel West, it's worth watching. ",

And it seems to me, as you said, there's a lot of people who have remained silent, who have just been watching this.  And as you said, there's going to be a backlash.  And that's something to be prepared for, because I think there's a lot of people just waiting on the sidelines, waiting to kind of start to chip away at this and cause doubt and divide people.  But I think that's so important that at its core, this is about integrity and honesty and decency and fortitude and courage, which are two other things you've spoken a lot about. ",

We all have our spots and our wrinkles, as it were.  But it's the courage and the fortitude.  That's what's necessary, the backbone.  We don't need lukewarm folk.  We don't need summer soldiers.  We need all-season love warriors.  That's the tradition that we saw represented in that church at the spiritual level.  And my dear brother Sharpton, you know, I love brother Sharpton.  We come out of the same black church tradition and so forth.  And we fight all the time and we come together and so forth.  And he was powerful, but I always want to connect The police power and police crimes with the Wall Street power and the Wall Street crimes.  We live in a culture in which people feel as if they can do and say anything and get away with it with no accountability, no answerability, no responsibility.  We saw it on Wall Street in terms of all of that insider trading, market manipulation and fraudulent activity and predatory lending.  How many went to jail?  Zero.  Trump, say anything, do anything, thinks he can get away with it.  Pentagon can drop drones and precious folk in Yemen, Pakistan and others and think they can get away with it.  We have to have accountability.  Our politicians can seemingly tell us anything in front of our faces and we know what's going on behind closed doors with their tiny big money.  Just be honest.  That's what integrity is.  Malcolm X used to say, sincerity is my only credentials.  That's why we love Malcolm.  We didn't always agree with Malcolm, but he said what he meant, and he meant what he said.  You see what I mean?  That's what we need.  We need that in our lives.  We need that in our communities.  We need that in our civilization.  And we need that as a critique of the worth of the American empire, the worth of American white supremacy.  the worst of American predatory capitalism, the worst of American patriarchy, and the worst of American homophobia and transphobia.  Any ideology would lose its sight of the humanity of folk.  I don't care if they're Arab, Muslim, Palestinian, Jewish, or whatever.  It's got to be all the way down.  You know, the English word human comes from the Latin humanda, which means burial.  And that's what we saw today.  We saw the humanity because they were ascribing significance that this precious person made in the image of God, whose body was now undergoing extinction and his soul ascending.  All right. ",

            "text": "Again, I mean, how could I possibly follow that?  But I'll try.  So just a couple of things I want to touch on that he pointed out here.  The need for a backbone, for us to have a backbone.  And for me, I connect this as well to representatives, to politicians, where we need people representing us that have a backbone to fight for these issues.  So are we going to have politicians that have the backbone to fight to defund the police, to understand that you can't have this one-size-fits-all force where they're dealing with all these different issues, that you need to defund or disinvest from the police and put those resources into other areas to properly deal with them?  Because you're seeing \u2013 I mean \u2013 Cornel West here also connects the, you know, the crimes of the police to Wall Street.  Because this really is, this really comes down to concentrated wealth and power and the power that it has over politicians, be it the police unions that have power locally and that have power on the national level, or be it Wall Street that has power over Congress.  Until you have representatives that are willing to fight back against that power, stand up to Wall Street, not take their money, stand up to these police unions, fight to defund them.  Until you have that backbone, you're not going to have real change when it comes to policy.  And now that we are seeing this energy in the streets, I think this is what is required to have representatives that represent that energy.  You need that energy in the streets first.  These sorts of movements, these changes, they never come from the top down.  It always comes first from the movements, and then it pushes into politics.  And we are seeing that begin now.  So him highlighting that, I think, I mean, again, It's Cornel West.  He clearly said it a lot better than I did.  So why should I even bother talking anymore?  I think he laid it all out there.  And again, I don't give Cena much credit.  I don't.  But here is a case where I'm glad they're having on Cornel West, or at least Anderson Cooper's having on Cornel West as often as he is.  And he needs to bring him on for a regular segment.  I mean, every day.  Just bring Cornel West on every day.  And I think the world... We'll be a better place simply because of that alone.  But obviously, there's a lot to learn here from Cornel West.  And as always, I mean, I'll link to the clip below the video as well.  So you don't got to watch this whole thing to share with your friends and family.  Just it's on Twitter.  For whatever reason, CNN hasn't put it up on YouTube yet.  I don't know why.  But it's on Twitter.  I'll link below and watch it again as there are many lessons in this clip that I didn't even touch on. ",
