            "text": "Good damn evening, Americans.  Jericho Green here with you once again, and I'm giving you tomorrow's video tonight.  I got a carpool with my boy Albert tomorrow.  I'll be there at 5.15, you fuck.  That's how men talk to each other.  Anyway, I'm going to give you this uncircumcised, veiny commentary in your ear holes to the bristle.  Those of you who have been subscribed for a long time, you know what that's about.  But first, I want to talk about these fucking morons from BLM.  I'm sorry.  If we're being honest, see BLM.  Certain Black Lives Matter.  Not all of them.  If the killer was white, the city is gonna burn tonight.  If the killer was black, who cares?  We don't give a fuck about that.  Really, and it's sad and stupid.  What's even more sad and stupid is that people believe that shit.  Anyway, I don't know where this took place, but I just saw the video of these fucking idiots blocking traffic on the highway.  Number one, that is stupid just for your own safety.  The cars are flying.  It's hard to make adjustments at high speeds, you dumbass.  But the video comes in where they've already stopped these fools and they're dragging one of these morons out of the car.  But what really pisses me off are these two stupid ass wenches out there.  Now, I don't know why, but for some reason, when a woman is like, she was like, you don't, you don't.  Telling the black cop.  You're a house nigga.  Oh, that shit drives me crazy.  I can't stand that shit.  I wish that cop would have grabbed her by her face and said, shut the fuck up.  We're trying to conduct an arrest here.  Shut your fucking mouth.  It's like a fucking gnat buzzing around your ears.  That shit drives me crazy.  But my point here is, is the double standard.  Because you know damn good and well, if that was a dude buzzing around that cop, talking shit, and she's on him.  He put, get back, get back.  As soon as he turns around, she's on him.  Following him, just nagging the fuck out of him.  That shit makes me so mad.  But you know if that was a man... His ass would have been on the pavement quick, fast, and in a hurry.  He would have had cuffs or zip ties and would have been in the back of the car.  In five seconds, you know it.  But since they're a couple of women, they let him slide.  They keep giving him rope.  You really want equality?  No, you don't.  You want to treat equality like a fucking buffet.  I like this.  I like this.  I don't want that shit.  I like this.  I like, oh, you're going to let me bug you more and more and more and more and more and give me chance after chance before you finally fuck me up?  I'll take that.  You don't want real equality because if you did, you would be face down on the hood of a car.  being arrested for obstructing their investigation, obstructing justice.  That's what you are doing.  You are literally hindering these cops from doing their job.  But because you have a vagine that I'm sure smells like raw sewage, they let you slide.  They didn't give you any stick time.  They didn't hook you up with that good old-fashioned customer service.  I don't know if I've told this story before, but when I worked at the radio station, every Friday night, we would be at this club called Club Zo in downtown San Jose.  And being that I was on the job, but I wasn't much of a drinker anyway, but I wasn't drinking.  So when you go out and you don't drink, you sit back and watch the night go bad for the people who are drinking too fast.  So this girl... For some reason, and you could totally tell, this girl, she was like early 20s.  She had some skirt that was like two inches below her clam.  You know, she had her little top on.  Whatever, I'm not hating.  But she was dressed like that.  And the woman she picked on, it must have been in the fall or something.  It was chilly that night.  She had on a jacket.  She had a purse on.  And it was like across her chest like this.  She looked like she was older.  She probably had some kids.  She was established.  So this girl starts fucking with her.  The older chick, the one who's more put together, she gives her a three-piece with no biscuit right in her mouth.  And what that means is she gave her three punches.  No biscuit, no bullshit, just the chicken, just the main course.  She pieced this girl up, blood everywhere.  The cops show up, they're interviewing, or he's talking to the lady who threw the punches, and she's like, look, I'm chilling with my girl.  She was drunk.  The vouchers corroborate her story.  But the girl is back there, you fucking bitch, you fucking bitch.  Ma'am, please.  Ma'am, fuck that bitch.  Ma'am, please.  Fuck that bitch.  Finally, the cop turns around, slams her on the hood of the car, puts her in the cuffs, and throws her in the back of the car, in the back seat.  And you know if that was a dude, he would have told him one time and then fucked him up.  And that's fine.  I'm okay with my place in this world as a man.  I understand that people have a shorter fuse with men.  We're more likely to get fucked up.  That's the case in all aspects of our life.  That's fine.  Babe, babe, did you hear that?  I'll be the one grabbing the great equalizer and going out into the darkness.  I'm okay with that.  But don't tell me you want equality.  No, you don't.  You want power.  You want to be above men.  You want to tell them what to do, but you don't want equality.  Don't give me that bullshit.  You can't handle this equality.  You can't handle equality.  So stay over there where if the ship is sinking, you and the kids can get off first, know your role, and shut your mouth.  Now, let's go to, and I'm sure you've all heard about this, Retardy B versus Candace Owens.  I can't even say that shit with a straight face.  Can you believe that?  So I guess on Twitter, on Instagram or something, they're going back and forth.  Look, Retardy B... Compared to Candace Owens, there is no comparison, but for the purposes of this exercise, Cardi B versus Candace Owens is like bringing not even a knife to a gunfight.  It's like bringing one of those little things on a plastic stick, and when the wind blows, it spins around.  That's like bringing one of those to a nuclear warhead fight.  This girl is unprepared.  She's in deep waters and she didn't bring her floaties.  You are out of your fucking league.  Like, I don't even know who told you it was okay to talk shit to Candace Owens.  Candace Owens is a picture of elegance and class.  She's made of sugar and spice and everything needed to destroy a fucking liberal celebrity.  Cardi B is more like if you had a mixing bowl and you throw in some dog shit, some horse shit, a little bit of homeless shit.  A pair of heels, a thong, some Hennessy, and cum.  That's Cardi B. You mix that up and bake it, you got retardy B. She's talking about how And at first, you knew it was her because it was so ignorant and stupid.  It looked like a third grader wrote it.  But then she comes back and she's like, well, I don't mind paying millions of taxes.  You know, as long as it goes to something good, it should go to free education and not defunding police.  What the fuck?  Who got a hold of your keyboard?  Who took your phone and took over for you?  Because you don't talk like that.  Remember that interview she did with Bidenist pervertists?  With Joe, bring me that 10-year-old Biden.  With Joe, let me smell your head, little kid.  Biden, remember that stupid shit?  When she was doing all these beeps and squeaks and first at first, like Biden and shit.  You don't go from that to, well, I don't mind spending millions in taxes as long as it doesn't go to law enforcement and it goes to the education.  You don't talk like that.  Somebody said, here, dummy, give me your phone so I can give you a fighting chance.  That shit.  How in the fuck did that even get set up?  Candace Owens versus Cardi B. You mean the woman who is married first before she has children?  Is that what you're talking about?  The one who's married to a faithful man versus retardy B versus what?  And I said this on a live stream I did with B Tatum.  Shout out to B Tatum.  It's funny that she has a song that they call WAP, right?  Because she's a Democrat, she's a liberal, she wants to see the end of racism, racism, racism, racism.  What, although it's not spelled the same, is a derogatory term for Italian people.  But nobody says shit.  Nobody is canceling her for saying that.  But if some white rapper came out with a song called Nigger, there would be a problem.  But she can come out with a song called WAP and nobody bats an eye.  What the fuck?  If you make a song where the acronym stands, it's WAP, Wet Ass Pussy.  That's what that stands for.  If you make a song titled that, you have no business in the realm of politics.  This is what Candace Owens does.  She is a Shaolin master of politics.  And you got this... trying to fucking battle her via Twitter.  Man, get the fuck out of here.  Oh my goodness.  Candace Owens is someone you would want to bring home to your mother.  Cardi B, or as I call her, Retardy B, is someone you wouldn't bring home to the mother of your dog.  Are you kidding me?  Now, just because you rap and you're from the streets does not mean you are without education or you are stupid.  That's not what I'm saying.  Cardi B is stupid because she's stupid, not because of what she does for a living.  Now, if you want to say, all right, Candace Owens, hop in the booth and lay down a hot 16.  All right, you got her.  And I don't know, if you give her time, she'd probably write some better shit than you, to be honest.  But that's your world.  That's your wheelhouse.  That's your lane.  Politics is not.  As soon as politics involves a stripper poll and an abortion, we will let you know, Cardi.  Man, let me get in here and feed my damn kids.  But you know how it goes.  I try to be done with the left, but they just won't let me.  Please subscribe.  Hit that notification bell because every time it rings, a piece of shit.  liberal cries.
