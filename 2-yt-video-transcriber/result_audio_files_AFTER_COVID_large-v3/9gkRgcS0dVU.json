            "text": "What's happening, fam?  LAR movement still moving.  Title of this video is, Why Would Black Men Not Want Patriarchy?  Oh, by the way, get your Black Men A Perfect T-shirt.  Go on O'Shea's page for that.  So I saw a little tweet, I want to say, of Jamil Hill that it's clear that black men do not want to tear down patriarchy.  Okay, first and foremost, black men have an issue with racism, not patriarchy.  Black women have benefited off of racism in the sense that you don't want a black patriarchy, but you want to be under a white patriarchy but you want to fight racism.  See, this is why guys don't have an issue with patriarchy.  Why don't you start asking these black men what have the matriarchs in their life done for them?  Now, I can't sit here and lie.  Like, my grandmother, she put me ahead in life.  She put me on the right path.  I'm not going to sit here and lie about that.  My father's mother.  My other grandmother, she took care of me as a young kid.  But my grandfather, he set the table.  He set the table.  That's just what it is.  Now, for most other people, it's the matriarchs in their family that basically let them down.  For one, what do you think these matriarchs are going to do?  for the boys in particular.  Y'all act as though a matriarchy is going to build something.  It's not.  A matriarchy is going to do something that helps both black men and black women.  It's not.  We've already been down this road.  You see through family court system that Look at the last 30 to 40 years.  How is a predominantly female ran household and family, how does that work out for the community?  Not well.  So why would black men want that?  I look at a lot of videos, right?  Listen to a lot of videos.  And you're starting to see black women having conversations with black women and seeing how off center black women are, how sisters are going way too far left.  I'm not talking about political.  I'm just talking about mentally, like.  this doesn't add up.  And these women were predominantly around matriarchs, right?  So how is matriarchy successful?  What has it done for the black community?  That's positive, seriously.  But you want these guys to vote to keep matriarchy going.  I don't know how voting to keep, I understand how voting to keep matriarchy going is, like if you vote Democratic, you keep matriarchy going, but in the black community, that is.  But here's the issue.  every other group in America and in the world is patriarchal.  And every other group is more successful than us because they're patriarchal.  Why would we continue to be matriarchal when we're in America, right?  You know, capitalism and you want the American dream.  Well, matriarchy is not going to get you the American dream.  Matriarchy is not going to get you to, um, to the mountaintop.  And sometimes the ladies look at it, a lot of the stuff that, a lot of the reasons why we're at where we're at is basically, what, 50-something years after the Civil Rights Movement, which, by the way, was predominantly by men in what you can consider, for the most part, that was a patriarchal strategy, right?  because a lot of the key figures were men and groups of men.  So the women subsequently have benefited from that within the community and outside of the community and other groups have benefited from that.  And now you see women are trying to basically tear down what was already put in place to kind of shove themselves up to the forefront.  Guys are tired of making sacrifices for women.  that's worthless.  These women are not going to make sacrifices for our sons.  But you can say these men have made sacrifices for their daughters.  So in that sense alone, why would these guys want to do anything outside of patriarchy?  Women, in a sense, want to tear down the patriarchy.  But you're not going to pay to fix it.  You're not going to get your hands dirty to fix it.  You're not going to put any sweat equity into that, into fixing it.  You just want to tear it down.  Who's supposed to build it up?  Some more men?  That doesn't make sense.  You break it, you buy it.  The other thing about this is we've come to find out over the years that A lot of this matriarchy, patriarchy talk has more to do with rebelliousness than it has to do with getting anything done.  It has more to do with let me do what I want to do and what I feel like doing.  And now, like I said, as I watch videos, you see hordes and hordes of older women trying to reverse what they did when they were making unilateral decisions.  And now they're looking for a man.  And this is why... You know, wanting black men to tear down patriarchy doesn't make sense because guess what?  Even the women who are on their feminist kick and their strong and independent kick, they want to retire.  I'm done with that.  That was just a phase.  It's a phase that cost the community just like the drug era cost the community, you know?  And now people want, oh, we got to get it together.  Can't be trusted.  You're compromised.  and people who are so on the tet of patriarchy down aspect, here's the other thing about it.  You don't see these people doing anything to compete with the patriarchy.  You know, when I said earlier about black men's issue is racism, One of our biggest issues with racism is it creates a wedge between us competing in America and the global marketplace because racism is used as business leverage.  The irony about that is some of the women don't feel like it's business leverage because they use things like Title IX and whatnot in... female subsidies and grants and loans to get ahead.  And the funny part about that is it's still not getting ahead.  You're still really not ahead of your men.  Black women are still not really ahead of your men financially, even though you've got the vast majority of the breaks to get ahead.  So why would black men say, you know what, we're going to bow down to the matriarchy Even though you're still behind us and we've had to deal with more obstacles and adversity for a longer amount of time in this government and it's systematic.  The irony about all of that that seems to go unnoticed is... If the kids are predominantly raised by their moms and the kids are unprepared for adult life.  because this is what we're seeing is a bunch of young adults and teenagers who are unprepared for life because they were raised by their mother.  The men are more a necessity than the women, basically, because when these kids don't make it, when these young adults don't make it, the excuse is they didn't have a father in their life.  So why would men want to help you to tear down patriarchy when we're to blame for the unsuccessful community when we're not even there in the family dynamic?  For whatever reason, right?  So, guys are not going to try to sign up to be the scapegoat.  So, we're going to let matriarchy be matriarchy and see, look at the numbers and see if it's successful or failure over years.  And to be perfectly honest, for our community, it's been a failure.  So, who's going to sign up to prop up a failure?  Makes no sense.  I'm done with this one.  Catch y'all next one.
