            "text": "I'm gonna assume you know about the game, so I'm just gonna talk, and if you don't want to hear what happens in the game, now's the time to bounce.  I decided to wait until the weekend to let the fallout from The Last of Us 2 happen because I wanted to see just how bad it would get.  Well, it's this bad.  People pretty much don't like this game, which is what I said when the leaks got out.  People are pissed about Joel's death, about Abby, about Ellie, and about the gameplay.  The main complaint by far is about Joel's death.  Not just that he died, but how he died and how Naughty Dog tricked people into thinking he played a bigger role in the game than he did.  They did this with this trailer, where they used the older Joel model in the trailer, but in the game it was either a younger Joel or another character entirely.  That's deceptive to the core, and it's a really shitty way to sell a game.  The defense for this is that Joel appears in the flashbacks, but that's not really the same thing, especially since there's no resolution to Joel and Ellie's story.  One of the things storytellers need to realize is that reality kind of sucks.  Sometimes the real story is better than anything you can make up, but sometimes you need to dramatize it.  Take Alan Turing's story.  In the Imitation Game, the biopic written about him, he learned that his friend Christopher dies from bovine tuberculosis.  They become very close, but he doesn't want anyone to know he's gay.  So when the housemaster coldly tells him about Christopher's death, Alan denies being friends with him.  The scene is well-written and beautifully acted.  the kid playing young allan has a job of pretending to pretend not to be heartbroken.  he does a fantastic job of it and that serves the purpose of showing how cruel it is to make someone have to hide their sexuality to the point of denying a friendship that meant so much to them.  The only problem is, that's not what really happened.  In real life, everyone knew Alan and Christopher were friends.  Everyone knew Christopher had this illness.  The school announced his death to all the students, not just to Alan alone, and it was a heartwarming and caring statement.  That could have worked on film, but the first one is better because it's more intimate.  You build to it.  You live it.  You hurt as much as Alan hurts.  You want Alan to have some happiness and that's because at the end of the film, an adult Alan is discovered to be gay and is forced to take medication to stop his sex drive and he ends up committing suicide.  The movie version serves a fulfilling narrative purpose and that's really key.  The audience needs to feel fulfilled in a beloved character's death.  You can kill side characters all you want, but a main character requires some attention and care.  look at the red wedding from game of thrones.  it's just as sudden and random and cruel and violent as joel's death but it's handled in a way in the book and the show that feels narratively right even though it feels emotionally wrong.  you're devastated by what happens and you want revenge but it doesn't come off as cheap or a plot device.  It feels like this would really happen in that world.  And the cruelty and the senselessness of it is what makes it so terrible.  But it doesn't feel contrived.  Joel's death, based on what most people are saying, feels totally contrived.  Done purely for shock value and given no real resolution.  It's made worse by a character who looks like Neil Druckmann spitting on Joel's body.  And then made even worse by forcing the gamer to play as Joel's killer, Abby, immediately after the scene so you can understand why she did it as if that would ever happen.  this is why people hate abby.  you're being forced to play as someone you despise and even being forced to fight ellie and beat ellie and then when you play as ellie trying to get her revenge ellie lets abby go like as from heel vs babyface points out.  basically abby gets everything she wants while ellie loses everything she has.  this works as a story.  if it's a novel comic movie show play it's perfectly fine but as a game it's infuriating to play.  no one wants to deal with something like that especially when as ellie you're forced to kill hundreds of people and dogs in very gruesome ways but you can't choose to kill abby.  meanwhile as abby you're saving kids and puppies and you're supposed to be this good person who later relishes the idea of murdering a pregnant woman.  When Ellie finds out that she's killed a pregnant woman, she's disgusted with herself.  Abby is over here like, I'm gonna dig that fetus out with a spoon.  And the change to Ellie was another problem for people.  Her personality's changed, which is fine.  She has aged about four years.  But the idea that she's become this vicious murderer who never questions her actions just doesn't fit the character.  The same goes for how Joel and Tommy act in the game.  Their personalities are completely different from the first game.  With Ellie, it's worse because you're forced to play as someone without being given any choice to decide how she behaves.  She descends into madness and cruelty, and there's nothing likable or understandable about it.  There also aren't any people outside of Dina who really question what she does.  So she's just violent.  And everyone's like, you know you'll probably die if you do that, right?  That's it?  That's how people would react in this crap sack world where they're struggling to survive?  I don't buy it.  Other gamers aren't buying it.  Now you see why people are pissed.  Add on top of that that while the game looks fantastic apparently it's the same game mechanics from the first game.  Nothing's really been improved or changed.  so you're forcing gamers to use outdated gaming mechanics while slogging through an overlong pretentious murder spree and then having to play half the game with a character they probably hate more than pedophiles.  10 out of 10.  Perfect scores in every Game Insight review.  Bullshit.  This game is a big pile of meh.  Great graphics don't make up for dated gameplay, shitty storytelling, or contrived writing.  Like I said in my previous videos, we now know why Sony and Naughty Dog flipped out over the leaks.  Because if people really knew what happened in this game, they wouldn't like it and wouldn't buy it.  And apparently they can't return it either.  There are some stores basically saying they're not taking any refunds.  Whether this is only for this shit show or all games is unclear, but still.  When your game is so bad, stores are like, nah, nah, I don't want it back.  That's a problem.  But what do I know?  I'm just some guy. ",
