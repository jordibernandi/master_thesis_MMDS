            "text": "So a tremendous amount of fake news going like even higher than the normal amount.  And it's usually a disgusting amount, kind of a disgrace.  And we're setting the record straight.  Okay.  That's why I'm talking directly to the people.  So the fake news can't distort it with their cameras and their sort of camera tricks.  Okay, there's a lot of, I think they're using special effects, to be honest.  Have you noticed this?  That like with all the Hollywood people who are very liberal, I think they're using the special effects to kind of do like stuff on me.  They're called deep fakes.  You ever heard the deep fakes?  So don't believe what you're hearing from these fake news press conferences and want to clear something up.  The light, we love the light.  Strong, very powerful light, but that's not what I said.  And I didn't say to drink, to put in a disinfectant.  That's not, nobody would say that.  That's bad science, and it's something I certainly would never say.  I said Diet Fresca.  Diet Fresca.  It's a soda.  Maybe some of the young people don't know that.  I know my beautiful OAN reporter, probably too young to know that.  But Diet Fresca.  could scare off the virus.  Because you ever notice when you have a soda, if you're having, I like Diet Coke, you're having a soda and you shake it up, okay?  Tremendous bubbles, like an amazing amount of like bubbles.  Believe me, you've never seen bubble, like forget a bubble bath.  We're talking exploding soda bubbles.  Notice how?  there's never a virus in the bubbles.  because viruses are very scared of the bubbles.  So like, it's called Diet Fresca, it's a soda.  We're thinking about that, but no, not disinfectant.  That would be very dangerous to do.  So I never said that.  And what I did say was actually Diet Fresca.  Another solution we're talking about is menthol cigarettes.  Another thing, because Corona, The invisible enemy, trademark pending.  It affects the lungs, and we want to have strong breath.  And the blacks use menthol cigarettes.  What we're thinking is, and I think the Surgeon General will back me up, the black cigarettes will scare the virus, which is like a redhead.  So very scary. ",
