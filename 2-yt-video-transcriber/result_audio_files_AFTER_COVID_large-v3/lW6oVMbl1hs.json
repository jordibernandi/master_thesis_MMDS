            "text": "Hey, I got a question.  How come nobody ever talks about how much black people don't riot, you know?  I mean, all the shit they put up with every day for generations and without rioting.  Meanwhile, if a bunch of white people's hockey team loses, they burn it all down.  I mean, white people catch all the shit for riding, but really, given the circumstances, they almost never do it, you know?  But you can only push people so far, and apparently they draw the line at wanton public murder at the hands of the law.  And I, for one, am not going to criticize that, okay?  I don't care about the looting or the methodology or any of that shit.  As far as I'm concerned, the blame for the situation in Minneapolis belongs solely to the Minneapolis police.  Put simply, if you don't want your town ripped apart by riots, then, to paraphrase 90s Jim Carrey, stop murdering people, assholes.  Shouldn't be that hard.  The rest of us seem to manage.  I can only think of two kinds of people who would murder someone in broad daylight in a public street.  Cartoonish hip men from gangster movies and your average everyday American peace officer.  you could take somebody who loves murder you could find some serial killing skin suit wearing from sacramento probably and tell him hey i'll give you a thousand dollars if you murder that guy in the middle of that street in daylight and he's gonna look at you like are you out of your mind?  no that would be crazy.  i'm a murderer but i'm not crazy right.  but for a cop it's tuesday.  they do it because they know they can.  who's going to stop them?  nobody.  what's going to happen to them?  nothing Even if the public gets pissed off, well, you just dust off the trusty law enforcement.  Oops, we killed a guy again, handbook.  Start going through that.  First things first, discredit the victim, right? ",

That's the craziest part, is that you can tell they think they're proving some kind of point with that shit when all they're proving is that in the opinion of those sworn to protect and serve, resisting arrest or trespassing while black justifies murder.  In their opinion, if the human being you're choking says, I can't breathe, the only appropriate response is to choke harder for a while.  This is how they think.  It's fucked up.  Then once they're done shitting on the victim, they move on to defending the cop, right?  It's always the same bullshit. ",

It's ridiculous.  They make excuses for what's completely inexcusable.  They give us answers to questions nobody's fucking asking.  The only answer to this shit is accountability, actual accountability.  And in this case, for the first time I can ever remember, I've actually seen some of it from other cops.  Sheriffs in Houston, Texas, Tennessee, Georgia, all came out publicly, strongly denouncing the actions of the cops in this case.  And buddy, when you have multiple Southern sheriffs saying to you, hey, maybe go a little easier on the blacks, y'all.  You have fucked up.  And whether it was that or the riots or combination or whatever, today they finally did what they should have done at the outset, and they put that murderous motherfucker in jail, which I guess is a start.  But if they want to put these fires out for good, they got to round up the three assholes who were with him that day, and more importantly, make sweeping, fundamental changes to the culture of their order.
