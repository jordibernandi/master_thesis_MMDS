I'm talking about people having accurate information.  In this pandemic, accurate information has made toilet paper seem plentiful.  America, the country that has the most Nobel prizes in science, also has the most willfully ignorant people per capita when it comes to understanding science. ",

La, la, la, la, I can't hear you, Mr.  Inconvenient Facts, because America is a country that cares more about the financial health of its corporations than the actual health of its citizens.  After all, who got most of the bailout cash?  Corporations.  And who is behind the grassroots, please, push to prematurely open America?  corporations and the politicians.  corporations pay.  But science doesn't watch Fox News, so it doesn't know that it's just a DNC hoax or the product of the Chinese Communist Party or some other childish QAnon conspiracy.  Georgia has one of the lowest rates of testing in the country, less than 1%.  But it's opening up anyway, because that's what happens when you make medical decisions for political reasons.  You're being an alarmist.  It would be like a doctor saying, we're going to treat your cancer with lower taxes.  Republican governors believe that sacrifices have to be made for corporate profits and that your grandmother... me just be one of them.  Bye-bye.  And because Donald, I don't take responsibility at all, Trump, is passing the buck to governors to make decisions so Donald won't be blamed. ",

South Korea's response was like a well-conducted symphony.  America's is like an open mic night at improv.  We have states with policies founded on epidemiological research, surrounded by states with policies founded on Twitter hashtags.  Oddly enough, Viruses don't respect state lines or your beliefs in how deadly they are.  So one state doing its best to level off the epidemic while the state next door is working overtime to spread it just winds up mixing up a big batch of fresh virus for both states.  It's like having a no smoking section in your car or no peeing section in your bathtub or a non-alcoholic side of your punch bowl.  The worst states spread the virus and prolong the pandemic for the rest of us.  This pandemic has proven two things.  You're only as healthy as the most stupid person in America.
