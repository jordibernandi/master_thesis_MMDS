I think that we need to hold people responsible for the things that they do, including police officers.  I can get right on board with you there.

No police officer should be entering into a home without knocking, right?  Because people have the right to defend themselves against someone coming into their home that they don't know of.  But I don't think that was the situation involving Breonna Taylor.  And I would encourage you, if there's anything you want to give me, any information that I can leave here today about Breonna Taylor that you would like me to look more into, I'd love it.
