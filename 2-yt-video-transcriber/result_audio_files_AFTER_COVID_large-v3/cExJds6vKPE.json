This president got us to a place where we had the lowest employment rate in the history of this country, historic lows for Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, the disabled veterans.  As the president has noted, and I think this is right, We had to put a stop to the economy.  It was a pause.  This wasn't some economic catastrophe that organically happened.  It was decided upon by the President of the United States to stop the United States economy because we had to save 2.2 million lives, perhaps more, somewhere in that range.  Because American lives, that's what mattered most.  And so this president, when faced with this very tough decision to put a pause on the hottest economy in modern history, said American lives matter most.  And that's what he did.  And I can tell you this.  The president that got us to the hottest economy in modern history, he's done it once, and he can do it again.  What's the point of that?  We're going to work with Congress.  We're going to come up with hopefully a phase four.  We encourage the House to maybe reconvene soon.  It'd be helpful if Nancy Pelosi was here.  But thus far, what we've done is the PPP, of course, Paycheck Protection Program, that has really kept a lot of employees on the payroll, 60 million employees, roughly half of the workforce And the private sector in this country have been kept on payroll thanks to that measure.  But going forward, principles like deregulation, principles like lowering taxes.  The President has mentioned a payroll tax pause, which would be a great thing for the American people.  There are a lot of proposals being entertained.  I don't want to get ahead of the President, but I can tell you- Isn't there a problem though? ",

But I would encourage the individual who did that analysis of my past, rather than focusing on me, he really should be focused on some of the very guests CNN chose to have on their network.  He should be focused on, I mean, my over here, Jim Clapper, who said 10 days before he privately told investigators there was no evidence of collusion, that Watergate pales in comparison to the Russia probe.  I'd encourage them to look at Samantha Powers, who's privately saying, I'm not in possession of any evidence of collusion.  Ambassador Rice, I don't recall intelligence or evidence of any collusion.  Former Attorney General Loretta Lynch, I do not recall that being briefed to me.  And for three years... two years, probably more than that, CNN ran with the collusion narrative.  And if the American people are watching right now, they're probably very confused as to some of the quotes I read, because those individuals were saying much different things publicly than they were saying privately.
