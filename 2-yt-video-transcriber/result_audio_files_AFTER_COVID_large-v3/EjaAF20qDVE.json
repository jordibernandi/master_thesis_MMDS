            "text": "Guys, welcome to Better Bachelor.  This is Joker with a face for radio and a voice for print.  I was originally going to put this video out last night, but because I have The Bachelorette on here and I'm doing a video review, I kept getting copyright hits on it and I edited it for four hours until almost 4 a.m.  And I never could get it to go out.  So I said, I scrapped it all because I had to cut it up into a bunch of pieces.  We're going to try this again.  Why?  Because this is a perfect example of what we talk about on this channel.  If I had to sum up everything that I talk about on this channel into one, like four minute, five minute clip of video, this is it.  So I'm going to set up the premise for you.  I'm going to tell you how I'm changing it so that hopefully I can get around the YouTube algorithm part of it.  And then we're going to talk about it.  First, if you watch the Bachelorette, I'll leave a link up here.  If you watch the Bachelorette video I did a couple weeks ago, it was about the Bachelorette having guys compete at dodgeball and the losers had to strip and get undressed on national TV and embarrass themselves.  And somehow this was OK with the producers.  And now there was a lot of flack for it and a lot of call out.  But my point was, there's never going to be a show that a woman would say or a man would say, hey, you two, all you ladies compete.  Whoever loses has to get undressed for me.  Never happened.  Never, never happened.  Number two call out on that video was the fact that the guys actually did it.  And they so they look like chumps.  And number three is there was one dude at the end of it, his name was Yosef, and that's who this video is about, who called them out and said, man, you guys, I wouldn't have done it.  Like, you guys embarrassed yourselves, you're embarrassing.  And, well, this video is him sitting down with a bachelorette and talking to her about it.  But here's what's important.  And this is what makes this so important.  A, he has a rational discussion with her.  Not a lot of emotion, pretty level-headed, just gets his point across.  Then she escalates.  Then she threatens.  Then she intimidates.  Then she gets physical with him.  And then all the other bachelors, all the other dude bros, white knight for her and become Captain Savo and come to her rescue without knowing anything that happened.  And then she plays the big V card, the victim card.  I can't believe, and the crocodile, the whole nine yards.  And so I'm going to show it to you.  I don't want to ramble on too much about this, but pay attention. ",

            "text": "Okay, so he calls her out on it.  You notice he's being very rational, calls it.  And I have to break this up again.  I'm sorry, guys, but YouTube is awful.  What I'll probably do is speed this up, speed the video up by 10 or 15 or 20%, and then lower the voice pitch back down 20%.  So it's just gonna be faster than normal, but hopefully that's enough to mess the audio up enough that the algorithms don't grab on.  But anyway, everything's fine so far, but he's not yelling.  He's not escalating.  He's just having a rational conversation.  Okay.  So he says, hey, now remember, he's not said, you are this.  You're awful.  You're bad.  He's not doing personal attacks other than saying, hey, I came here to maybe look for a wife, mother for my daughter.  The example, I don't know how this is going to work.  help you find a husband.  it doesn't set a good example for my daughter and i. it was it.  i would never embarrass myself on national tv like this and i think you doing this was not a good idea and it's not who i'd like to bring home to become part of my family with my daughter.  that's it.  that's where we are.  but he said it very rationally.  i'm looking for someone You can see in that camera angle, and I know I got to break this up.  You can see in that camera angle already.  she's angry and the finger's coming out.  And it's very close to his face.  I'm not going to back it up because it'll mess up the video, but it's getting in his face already.  So now watch the finger.  Watch her escalate.  Watch her stand up and lean over him.  And watch when she grabs him unprovoked.  I gotta stop it here again.  No, notice, number one, she leans over him, she puts her finger in his face.  He stands up because she's trying to intimidate being taller than him.  And he's like, nah, I'm like 6'3\", 6'4\", and you're maybe like 5'10 in heels.  That ain't happening.  But when he goes like this, you can see now, this is a common like, look, everyone, I am not, I'm not touching her.  This is a new normal, unfortunately.  You see it all the time with guys when they're in an argument with a woman.  This isn't a, okay, you're right.  I'm sorry.  No, that's not that.  It's, I'm not touching her.  Here's my hands, everybody.  I give up.  I'm not touching her.  But number two, when he starts to turn away and tries to disengage, she grabs him and turns him back.  meaningful because this shows you that number one he was rational.  number two she escalated she threatened she grabbed him and these people aren't dating they aren't boyfriend girlfriend.  this is still the getting to know.  you phase now.  what do you think she'd be like without a camera on her in national TV in the privacy of one of their homes where it's all quiet?  do you think that she would just be cool or do you think she would have escalated this further?  furthermore I, again, I want you to now pick, don't picture her as the sweet girl next door.  I want you to think of her as now being this guy's ex-wife who's going into court, who wants custody, extra money, wants alimony.  Watch the acting job that she does here. ",

This is what society does.  When I did a video about a man being physical with a woman in public, And it was done by the BBC, I think.  And the woman was being physical with a man in public.  When the man was physical and the woman, everybody came up and said, hey, what's going on?  You need to back up.  Everybody jumped in.  When the woman was doing it to the man and no one jumped in, everybody, when they were interviewed afterwards, they admitted they were thinking, I was wondering, wow, what did he do to her?  to make her that mad at him.  They instantly put it back on the guy.  Well, here it is.  Everybody's putting it on the guy who, again, just had a rational conversation with her.  And this is where it goes.

            "text": "All right, so now I'm not talking about her saying, can you imagine talking to a woman like that?  That's not the point that I was bringing up.  We'll just pause here for a moment.  Now, yes, you see the crazy eyes, but you notice something?  Okay, so here's how it goes.  After the dude bros and she walks away with a... And how dare you talk to a woman like that?  I would never.  But you notice this whole thing got started by her.  Everything that has transpired was started by her.  All he did was have a conversation with her that she didn't like.  From there, she got a finger in his face.  Then she stood up and got confrontational, which to his credit, you should stand up.  Never let anybody tower over you if you can help it.  Then she tells him to get out of here.  Then she starts and she's a little physical with him.  Then he's trying to walk away and all the other dude bros come in to comfort her.  Could that have been the end of it?  Yep, that could have been the end right there.  She could have just said, you know, that just got way out of hand and I can't believe and whatever.  But what does she do?  She walks around sobbing.  All right, she's doing the crying thing.  Then she says, how dare he talk to a woman like that?  Remember, this was all instigated by her, but when he stood up for himself, now she is the one that's been wronged.  But here's the kicker.  On my video recording right here, look at her eyes.  Other than being crazy eyes, do you know what else you're missing?  Eye makeup running.  There's no running mascara.  If she's walking around making these... Now, I've seen women tear up before where they have to dab their mascara because they're at a wedding or something and they're a little bit of leaky eye.  And they're like, oh gosh, don't make me nothing, please, because my mascara.  But if she's making sobbing noises without actual tears coming out, that doesn't make sense.  You don't sit there going... with nothing coming out of your eyes.  It doesn't work like that.  First the tears come, and then when you get more upset, the sobbing comes.  At least they tell me, because I'm too masculine to have ever cried in my life ever, even as a child.  Right?  You don't just start making these sobbing noises and have nothing coming out of your eyes.  And then it's all him.  So now, I want you to picture Miss Crazy Eyes here in court.  Now, remember, they're not boyfriend and girlfriend.  They're only dating.  Now, picture you're married to her.  Would she pull out the tears for the child support if she's willing to do it over a disagreement, not even an argument?  She pulls out the tears for a disagreement.  She pulls out the sobbing noises.  She pulls out, can you believe what he did to me?  How dare you?  Oh, gosh.  Do I have it loaded up?  How dare you?  How dare you?  How dare you?  How dare you talk to a woman like that?  Well, you started insulting him and calling him out, so he did the same to you.  You got in his face, so yeah, he threw it back at you.  Hey, maybe you shouldn't be, you know, you tried to get guys to undress on TV for a sport.  You want to call me out for being unreasonable?  Hey, you're the one that's 39, almost 40 here on a contestant show to try to meet somebody because you're so unreasonable.  Is that a low blow?  Hey, I think it's above the belt.  I'd call it a gut shot.  It's a gut shot, but it's not below the belt because look what she's pulling out of her armory.  So you can see now her talking to her friends, her talking to relatives, her talking to family if she were married to this guy.  Will she have problems lying?  Nope.  Blaming him?  Nope.  No problems with it.  Talking to a judge?  Nope.  This is why you, number one, look for red flags.  Because all, can you imagine being married to this and having these problems?  But number two, we just saw the winner of The Bachelor.  We just saw, or The Bachelorette.  We just saw the 2020 winner of The Bachelorette because he just got in an SUV and left.  He's the winner because he left with his integrity intact.  He made her look like awful.  And every other dude, bro, bro, dude, dude, dude, bro.  that was there that came to play Captain Save-Ho, And I say that fast specifically so YouTube doesn't snag it.  For every one of those guys that came over to White Knight for her, they all lost.  They all just got sucked in.  So whichever guy, whichever one of those guys that she ends up with, she's going to manipulate the heck out of them.  She's going to get her way.  And when she doesn't, this is what she's going to be like.  And then if they actually get married, that guy is going to get raked over the coals for every penny he's got.  But there it is, guys.  Manipulation 101.  The crocodile tears, she escalated everything right in one video for you.  This is why I talk about this stuff.  This is why I read the articles that I read and talking about, you know, it's not always just about going your own way and, you know, being your own man.  It's also about understanding what happens when and if you decide to date.  Why many of us, so many of us left the dating?  because we dated women like this.  And then when you see the narcissism and the selfies and the self-entitlement, those are all the same red flags that this woman, I'm sure, shows.  And why we say, oh, no, no, no, that's trouble waiting to happen.  Because the first few dates or months or several months might go okay.  This is what's waiting for you at the end.  And this is why so many guys go, who knew?  I see what's coming.  I've been there.  I'm out.  I'm out.  I'm going to make this short and sweet.  I got my point across.  If it's edited all crazy, I'm sorry.  Got to do what I got to do.  But you guys have to see this.  But guys, there you go, man.  I don't even have to go into it anymore.  It says what it is.  Guys, that's it for me.  This is Better Bachelor.  I'm joking.  Remember, here it is.  Proof positive why so many men are out of the game. ",
