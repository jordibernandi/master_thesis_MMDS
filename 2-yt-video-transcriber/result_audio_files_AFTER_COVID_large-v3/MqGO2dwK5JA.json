            "text": "Hey everybody, this is Deb with Truthfication Chronicles and this is going to be just a short little video because it's something odd that I found.  I'm going to do a regular size video to put out in the morning, but it's just been kind of a crazy last few days.  My dad turned 92, woo-hoo, and I ended up spending a lot more time with him, which is a great thing.  So let's get into this and then, like I said, tomorrow morning we'll have one that's more normal.  But this one's just an oddity that I found.  First of all, I want to say thank you to Phoenix here at PIR or peer or whatever.  I don't know how he says that.  But this channel right here, this guy has a spectacular idea and I think I'm going to start doing it too.  What he does is he gives a shout out to another Patriot channel that's kind of smaller.  And I think that's really good because we need to get people to join these other channels and to broaden our base and get a lot more people that have more subscribers.  because when you have more subscribers it puts you further up in the searches supposedly.  if you know who the powers that be aren't doing something to you.  So I think this is a brilliant idea.  And like I said, I'm going to try to do that.  I'm going to put his link down below, you know, in the description with all the other links that I normally put, but there's only going to be one this time.  And I hope that you'll go and you'll subscribe to him too.  So that's what I wanted to say on there.  Welcome to all of you who came over from that.  Wow, I was really astonished this morning when I opened up my stats and I'm like, whoa, what happened?  So that was a pleasant surprise.  I want to thank you very much for that.  But what I really wanted to show you on this one is the bizarre closed captions on this.  Now, I'm not sure if any of you follow along and have those on.  I know that there are some people who are hard of hearing.  If you watch the closed captions on this one, you're not going to understand anything that's going on because I think the algorithm that was doing these closed captions this time was on something.  I'm serious.  They are not saying anything at all what it was being said.  Now, I know Spanish, so I was listening to the Spanish, too.  He was speaking very slowly, so it was easy to understand him, if you know just a little bit.  And the person who was translating was translating correctly, so that's not the issue.  Now, I'm going to leave the sound off, just because I don't want you focusing on the sound.  I want you to focus on these words down here.  because it gets really strange.  I mean, just look at this.  Economy stays, Donald new.  I mean, the further it got, the more I had to laugh.  But there's a couple things in here that made me raise my eyebrow.  And I just wanted to kind of point them out to you because I thought it was really odd.  Now, I don't know if you are aware, if you don't have a channel, you might not know this, but we normally just put it and let the automatic one work.  And it puts in the captions automatically and they're not accurate really.  But for us to go back and to go through them all and correct them, it would like take hours to do that.  I've tried it.  So it takes a lot longer than just the video to make sure you get that done.  Of course, you can do your own captions and you can upload them.  And if you've ever seen mine, it always starts out with truth vacation, which, you know, just can't understand truthification.  It doesn't understand that, but that's okay.  I have changed it on a few of them, but that's what I'm spending my time doing is that.  But I wanted to show you this because these get really weird.  Alright, so I'm just gonna play it and again I don't want you focusing on the sound because the sound really didn't say any of these things.  You know, okay may have had the word economy in there.  he'll do the region.  No, America does not.  North America ACA as soon as he saw a purpose.  fundamentally is fundamental.  this a locale a fundamental noticia course.  a Very good news, bada.  This is for the inhabitant.  Look, it talks about the South Pole.  They weren't talking about the South Pole.  And then it has DNA raiment?  Those silly man press to know I have new elements.  This is not saying anything.  Oh, I'm going to leave the link down below.  You can listen to it for yourself, but integrate like you all.  Yeah, the Regency after and to negotiate.  Now, hang on here.  A saying that this is first of all, that sets forth gay lives matter because he is that.  Did you see that?  Gay lives matter.  It was not anything they said.  No, no, that's not what they said.  I mean, you're talking about South Pole, you're talking about DNA, you're talking about gays.  None of this was what they were talking about at all.  So, wow.  Okay, let me go back to where we started somewhere back in here.  Yeah, there we go.  Okay.  Okay. ",

Oh, so yeah, tell me how those phrases got in there, some of them.  And I mean, they don't sound anything like what was being said.  So what's the deal?  And especially that phrase, why would that phrase be in there?  It sounded nothing like it.  So you got to wonder if they're messing around with stuff sometimes.  And my heart goes out to people who are hard of hearing because if you can't hear, how are you going to know what it really says?  Because none of that is comprehensible.  If you're just reading those closed captions, you're not going to understand anything that went on when they were doing this.  Now it could very well be that the reason it's so bad was because of the interpreter, you know, that the translator was kind of messing up its algorithm or the way it works.  but I don't know.  I thought it was hysterical when I heard it and well, read it.  I don't know.  I don't know why it said that.  So anyway, that's what I've got for you on this one.  I know it's really short, but I tell you folks, I'm going to have one tomorrow morning with a lot of headlines that are good stuff, stuff you need to know.  So stay tuned for that one.  So stay tuned for that one.  And I want to thank you for stopping by and I'll see y'all later. ",
