And this is Right Angle brought to you by the members of BillWhittle.com.  And it is escape from New York City time, I got to tell you.  But it's not one, you know, reckless kind of ragtag rebel trying to get out of there with the president of the United States.  It's all their high-end retailers, and they are actually suing to get out of leases from some of what used to be the most valuable retail space in the whole world, or at least pretty close to it.  Gentlemen, the Daily Mail reported on Monday that luxury goods maker Valentino wants out of a 2013 lease nine years early.  This thing's supposed to go until 2029.  It's giving an idea how valuable this real estate is.  They're paying twenty five hundred bucks per square foot for this retail space.  It's huge.  But should I pay?  Yeah.  Right.  When the landlord told him, no, because who's going to start paying this money now after COVID-19 and the riots and defund the police and all the rest?  They filed suit and the suit claims that business at the premises has been substantially hindered and rendered impractical, unfeasible and no longer workable.  In addition to Valentino, other retailers trying to get out of Dodge include Jay-Z's Rock Nation, Victoria's Secret.  There's an NBA owned NBA store of some kind.  And nobody wants to be in New York.  I mean, some of these stores are on Fifth Avenue.  It's just it's it's insane.  Scott.  We've seen what happens when people start to leave a city like this.  The example I'm thinking of is Detroit.  New York can't go that route, can they?  It's one of the biggest cities in the world. ",

But if you're able to achieve a proper balance of good businesses and kind of a variety of economic strata within neighborhoods and decent policing and fair courts, that you can maintain a city, even though common sense would dictate that you don't stack people 27 stories high.  But... But if any of those elements start to fail, then the whole house of cards collapses because these stores can't afford to stay in places where they can't sell their goods.  And who wants to walk into a store that's selling a $2,500 handbag or whatever it is that they sell in the midst of the possibility that you're going to be assaulted or at least shouted at and made to feel bad by a mob of people?  who are protesting something that's not directly related to those stores.  So I don't... I'm sure there are some business people who early on say, well, that's right.  These people have a right to protest and peaceful protest is a good thing.  And, you know, petitioning your government for redress of grievances, that's all great.  But at a certain point, they've got to look at their own existence and their employees and their stockholders and the people who are dependent upon those businesses and their customers and just say, you know, the trade-off here, the cost-benefit analysis doesn't work out in our favor and we've got to get out of here.  And sadly, what some of these rioters and looters are doing is chasing away the columns that support that society's equilibrium.  And once those columns are gone, you can't build anything back up on it for a long time to come. ",

But it seems like Black Lives stopped mattering or at least the movement Black Lives Matter stopped mattering as soon as it took them out of the black and into the red.  Is that about right?  Yeah.

            "text": "Some movement at this point, right?  It's not just New York, Bill.  There is another story.  This was on Monday due to Seattle's unrest.  A billion dollar investment firm, I forgot the name of it, is pulling up stakes and moving to Phoenix.  And as I think you know, the investment world is pretty.  Pretty solidly Democrat, probably like 99 to 1.  And I want to read you just the opening paragraph of this piece by Michael Snyder at TheMostImportantNews.com.  He says there's a mad rush to leave America's blue cities.  He writes, so many wealthy people are rushing to move away from the big cities.  that is creating a bit of a real estate crisis.  boom in many suburban areas, small towns and rural communities.  Fear of COVID-19, a collapsing economy and the tremendous urban violence that we have witnessed in recent weeks.  And I just add the whole defund.  the police movement coming at this moment of any moment have combined to create a frenzy of activity.  He says, last week, my wife and I heard from a friend in New York City that it is all of a sudden desperate to relocate.  and says, if I were in his shoes, I would be wanting to move too.  But at this point, so many are all thinking the same thing, that the demand for housing in certain areas, like the one I live in and the exurbs of Colorado Springs, threatens to greatly exceed the supply.  Bill, I have to ask you, is this the best time to be a suburban or exurban homeowner with all of these idiot city dwellers coming in to flash their money at us?  Or is there a real danger here? ",

            "text": "Now, every little suburb in America gets to be their own little Texas and experience the joy of having people who've ruined, utterly trashed their own economies through their own ridiculous, self-serving, virtue-signaling politics coming to your neighborhood and then making their very level best to do the same thing to where they live now.  Washington State, when they lost Boeing, I mean, A billion dollar investment fund is insignificant compared to Boeing, given how deep their roots were.  Boeing left Washington because the people of Washington state voted for politicians that made it impossible for Boeing to stay in Washington.  Pretty simple, really.  I do want to go back to New York, though, because New York is not Seattle.  It's not it's not Minneapolis.  It's not Los Angeles.  New York is New York.  It's unique.  Yeah.  The.  First of all, the idea that Jay-Z would be moving Rock City out of Los Angeles, I thought he was down with the movement.  I guess it must be racism that's driving him away.  Because my understanding was that he was solidly down with the Black Lives Matter movement.  I don't know what else this could be, but just rampant white supremacy on the part of Jay-Z.  And I'm just very shocked and I'm very, very, very disappointed.  Now, as far as the grounds of the lawsuit goes, they have absolutely solid grounds of the lawsuit.  All of the leases in New York City, every single lease in New York City is predicated whether it's in the lease or not.  It's predicated that you live in a city that has the rule of law.  That's the assumption that comes with any kind of a legal document.  If I'm signing a legal document rather than moving into a house because I have more weapons than somebody else, then that's assuming that there's a legal system in the rule of law.  If progressive communists like Bill de Blasio have decided that they're no longer going to enforce the law in New York City and then it becomes a lawless zone, the entire island of Manhattan, Then you're under no obligation to continue to live under a legal obligation with a city government that doesn't believe in law.  It's already shown you it doesn't believe in law.  It just lets people run through the streets and smash all those windows.  And you were talking about Scott was talking about, you know, people going shopping in these stores and being jeered and mocked and so on.  Yeah.  The real problem is that there won't be any $25,000 handbags because somebody came in and smashed the windows last night, took them all.  So I think they're absolutely right to get out.  But here's what's interesting about New York City.  New York City, for a number of reasons, is not any other city, Steve.  But the main thing that's interesting about New York City is that New York City is the national U.S.  headquarters for progressive elitism.  It is where all of the... All of the news agencies are located, have their biggest offices, all the financial agencies you mentioned earlier.  The giant communications offices are there.  Hillary Clinton is a senator from New York.  New York is where the liberal elite meet to greet.  And if... If the high end of New York is talking about getting out, then you have to start asking yourself some questions about what is happening to the total population of New York City.  If people who've invested tens of millions of dollars in condos, for example, are talking about abandoning that investment and just walking away from it because it's become so unlivable there.  It makes you wonder what is happening politically.  What is the political shift on the streets of New York and up in the skyscrapers?  How far to the right have New Yorkers moved?  I don't think it's lost on too many of them that there is a guy out there who apparently has an active phone.  You could make one phone call to a guy named Giuliani and your problems in New York would be over and they wouldn't be over because he would send in tanks and just squash people.  You could make one call to Rudy Giuliani.  And if you called Rudy Giuliani and asked him to come back and be mayor, I guarantee you these businesses would no longer be demanding to get out of their lease.  Because he would restore law and order and save lives.  And so this is where progressive politics ends up.  This is New York.  Jay-Z's company is a perfect, perfect example in microcosm of what's happening in the macrocosm.  You've got an extremely high-end brand that costs a lot of money, paying huge amounts of money and making money.  in New York City selling, you know, kind of selling street legitimacy to these lily white elitists.  to give them some sense of self-respect, I guess.  And now they're talking about leaving because the movement that they represent in terms of their fashion and all the rest of it has destroyed any means of doing business in New York City.  I find it interesting that Jay-Z is going on the business end of this rather than on the black end of this, because that's basically what's happening.  He has made a decision as the owner of that company, do I go with the Black Lives Matter side or do I protect my investment?  And guess which one he took?  So if New York, if the if the richest people in New York are leaving New York, which is an irreplaceable experience, if you listen, if you listen to New Yorkers talk about New York, it is irreplaceable.  There's nothing else like it.  And to that small degree, they're right.  There is nothing else like it.  If they're talking about getting off of Manhattan and not coming back.  then at some level, you would think that the reality that has forced them off of this one and only place in the world will start to catch up with them a little bit and maybe affect the way that they actually vote for people in the future.  Maybe next time they might want to just give some thought, I don't know, just off the top of the... top of my head, maybe think about electing somebody who's not a communist, anarchist, left-wing idiot who believes in politics and who's very proud of the fact that his own daughter, the mayor's daughter, was down on the street smashing windows of the stores that are now trying to leave New York City.  Oh, and one more thing.  I'm sorry.  This is something that I thought of and I've been thinking about an awful lot with regard to people leaving California and going to Texas.  I think we really need to look seriously into this extremely wise Roman Catholic philosophy.  philosophy and the idea of purgatory.  I think that what we ought to do is we ought to establish a purgatory zone around every one of these large cities and that people who want to leave the cities and move into the real world where real people vote, then they should be kept in this purgatory for 10 years, let's say.  And we'll examine how they vote.  Their votes won't count, obviously.  But we'll give them 10 years to understand why the place that they're leaving doesn't work and why the place that they're moving to does work.  And after 10 years, if they haven't got it, then fine.  They go to purgatory, chuck them back there for another hundred years and get the prayers going.  Because if you're too stupid after 10 years to see that you can't take with you what you're running away from and go to a place that you like and bring what you're running away from with you without ruining that place.  I'm telling you, it's a profoundly good idea, this purgatory thing.  I'm going to look into it. ",

            "text": "All right.  Bill made me have a thought, and I apologize for this, but I'm going to share it with you now.  Yeah.  And it's this, you know, people talk about pre-Giuliani New York, under Dinkins and Ed Koch and all the rest, where it was slums and it was crime, and Times Square was hooker and pusher and live sex show central.  And under Rudy Giuliani and also under Mike Bloomberg, the city cleaned up, the money came pouring in.  It was a whole stretch of condos.  I believe it's not just Central Park, known as Billionaire's Row.  that just got built as all of this money flooded in because New York City was, again, the place where rich and famous people wanted to go, even if it was just for their weekend shopping.  It was worth spending huge amounts of money on one of these condos just to do that.  And the money came pouring into the city coffers.  Keep that thought in mind for me, or keep that thought in your mind for just a moment.  We're going to have a post-De Blasio New York.  that's going to look a lot more like pre-Giuliani New York.  And a reader of mine over at PJ Media asked me, you know, why did people vote for De Blasio?  He ran on a platform, an explicit platform of undoing the things that Giuliani and Bloomberg had accomplished for that city.  And I thought about it for a moment and I thought, you know... They voted for him because it made him feel good.  The city was flush with cash.  Everything looked great.  And it made him feel good to vote for the guy who was going to undo all of those mean things that those previous two mayors had done.  Well, there's going to be a cascade effect.  If the rich people start leaving billionaires row and all the rest, then the middle class starts leaving as well.  And pretty soon you're left with, well, you're left with pre-Juliana New York.  And what this reminds me of, this idea of voting for the guy who you know is going to piss it all away.  You know it.  He said he would do it.  Not in so many words, but he said he would do it.  This idea of feeling good, it reminds me of a drug addiction to Oxycontin or anything like that.  You do something that feels good until it kills you.  So if in 5, 10, 15 years we're looking at the corpse of New York City, the medical examiner statement is going to list the cause of death as accidental suicide.  There's your right angle on that.
