            "text": "Good morning.  We're here to commemorate and celebrate the life of the forgotten ten, namely Kevin Barry, the first of them.  He gave his life for Ireland.  He bravely walked to the gallows and he was hung.  this day 100 years ago, 1920, 1st of November.  He was worth millions of the people that the education system are churning out these days, the snowflakes.  But anyway, the forgotten 10 were hung and buried, corporal burial in Mountjoy Prison, never to be released.  Until recently, they were all exonerated.  And they got a Christian burial here at Prospect Cemetery, now known as Glasnevin Cemetery.  These brave men are an example to us that the national ideal can never be quashed.  The flame of the national ideal can never be extinguished.  We've taken what is known as the extreme view that we prioritised Ireland and the Irish people first and foremost.  And in today's politically correct climate, that is an extreme view, believe it or not.  But we just want to commemorate how brave these men were and how lucky.  We wouldn't be standing here if it wasn't for them.  And I urge everybody in Ireland and the Irish diaspora all around the world to get behind the National Party to celebrate the national ideal and never apologise for it.  Just as you take care of your wife and children, your family, you do it unapologetic.  That is us in the National Party.  Ireland belongs to the Irish, we say that proudly and we should prioritise our own people first and foremost.  Just as these ten brave men, the forgotten ten behind us, laid down their lives to make that point.  And as Padraig Pearce said at O'Donovan Ross's graveside, the fields, the fields, they have left us our Athenian dead.  Well that is the national ideal, we will never forget our fallen dead.  Arash Arroy. ",
