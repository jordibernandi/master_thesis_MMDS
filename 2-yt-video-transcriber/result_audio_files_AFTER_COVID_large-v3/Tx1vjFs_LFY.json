You can look people up, you can check facts, and occasionally you can look at a nice pair of tits every once in a while.  You've all done it.  But some people don't think before putting stuff of themselves on the internet, one of those groups is the black militia, or in particular, Grandmaster Jay.  Let me be clear that just because someone doesn't agree with your beliefs doesn't mean they're racist.  We can disagree and still get along.  Well, Jay, you sure have upped it a notch.  You're training women how to use guns in your living room like you're back on the army shooting range.  These are live rounds.  Do you show them how to put their tampons in as well, or do you charge extra for that?  I mean, she must be super excited to learn from an expert shooter. ",

Get it close enough so you can see it.  First four shots, 50 yards.  See, the funny thing is, I was never in the military.  My five-year-old cousin could probably hit the paper from 30 yards away with a pistol.  And with a rifle, she's probably going to have a tighter grouping 30 yards away than the security guards group around you when you go to the gas station to get a pack of gum.  Come on, man.  I mean, this is what I'm talking about before.  you just upload stuff on the internet.  So if you're a leader, especially by example, and you can't even hit the paper from 30 yards away, does that mean that the rest of your people just don't even know how to use a gun?  Clearly from the video in your living room.  Jay, I found out that you were a presidential candidate back in 2016. which is similar to John Fitzgerald Kennedy.  We have something in common.  He exited this world a great leader.  Wow, man, you sound like you're trying to impress a banker the day that you try to go in to get a loan.  I mean, come on, man.  You've got a photoshopped picture of you with Michelle Obama.  Better watch out, Brock.  He's trying to come in behind you on that one.  Now, I haven't even gotten to the best part.  So I have a good buddy who's helped me with a lot of this information that I'm about to share with y'all.  That was a high ranking army guy at one point in his life.  Goes by Mad Dog.  So here's why you screwed up, Jay.  You're wearing a Sergeant Major E9 rank on a sparkly shirt which is civilian clothing.  AR 670-1 states that you cannot wear any rank on civilian clothing. ",

Because if you're not, you know what that's called, right?  That's called stolen valor.  You for sure would have put that on your presidential website because people would have loved that.  right nope it just says that you're an army veteran on there.  what about your presidential linkedin profile that's filled out with every single award you've gotten since 1990. i'm surprised your t-ball trophy isn't on there.  nothing that says you were sergeant major e9.  i don't know what's going to be worse nancy pelosi giving the family of george floyd a flag like he was a fallen soldier or if you're really not a sergeant major the day that you get arrested.  But if you are, you should know better not to wear your rank on a sparkly shirt that you probably bought at TJ Maxx.  John Wayne.  John Wayne. ",
