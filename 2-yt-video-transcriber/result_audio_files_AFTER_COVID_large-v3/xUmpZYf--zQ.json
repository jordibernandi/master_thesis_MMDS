            "text": "I am having a very bad day.  I am in no mood.  This, today, is one of the worst days that I've had in a long time.  I'm not in the mood to play with anybody.  Hello, fellow Bernie bros.  I know it's been hard since Bernie suspended his campaign.  I know it's going to suck when he eventually endorses yet another establishment hack.  But fear not, because I'm here to give you five ways to cope.  Number one, alcohol.  Biden's brain is melting.  He doesn't know where he is half the time, he loses his train of thought, he wanders off camera, and Trump is like a 12 year old on Xbox Live.  The combination of these two, these two titans coming together, will be hilarious.  Trump will beat Joe Biden like a pinata, an old, senile pi\u00f1ata.  And the DNC will be forced to watch helplessly as their golden goose gets boiled alive right in front of their eyes.  Hilarious!  Ignore the looming dread of World War III as we inch ever closer to war with Iran.  I'm not worried though.  I won't get drafted.  Ignore the fact that poor people will be absolutely fucked.  Republicans kill the poor.  Democrats kill the poor.  Clean.  Don't think about how Trump has been fighting to cut the Affordable Care Act, how Biden's plan still leaves 10 million people uninsured, how he said he would veto Medicare for All if it was on his desk, and how thousands and thousands will continue to die every year, no matter who wins.  I literally, I can't open this.  Oh my god.  I might not be able to do this bit.  This is why we need men.  Yes!  I am woman.  Here you are.  So yes, we're in the middle of a pandemic where millions and millions of people are losing their jobs and therefore their health insurance during a healthcare crisis.  But vote blue no matter who, am I right?  Here you go, Democrats.  Drink up.  Don't call it a grave.  It's the future you chose.  As we've seen, Bernie's policies are incredibly popular, especially with every Democrat under the age of 50.  Exit polls overwhelmingly showed people agreed with Bernie's policies, yet voted for Joe Biden.  Thanks, MSNBC.  Thanks, CNN.  Couldn't have done it without you.  There are going to be so many Bernie impersonations in the future.  Whether that's a good thing or a bad thing, we don't know yet.  But they're gonna want that sweet, sweet young people vote.  And if my patriot care theory is true, even Republicans are going to eventually jump on this as well.  But seriously, Trump talked about a public option in 2016, so they all know these policies are popular.  Will future candidates actually go through with them?  Or will we stay cucked by the health insurance industry for all eternity?  Stay tuned!  Bernie has often stated that it doesn't matter what race or gender a candidate is, as long as they have good policies.  Wow, what a sexist.  So Biden at the last second decided to one up Sanders, promising to make his VP a woman.  Now that's what a real feminist looks like.  And as he stated multiple times, Biden plans on being a one-term president.  Also stating that his VP possibly needs to be ready to take over on day one.  So yep, that's right.  America might get its first female president because the president stepped down or died.  Empowering!  I for one welcome our new female overlord who got her position.  out of tokenism and not on her own merit.  Maybe it will be Hillary Clinton.  After all, she does believe.  God put her on earth to be president.  That woman will stop at nothing.  Nothing.  I'm sure half the people watching this right now know me solely from my pathetic simping for Bernard on Twitter.  Keep the money.  I don't want a refund.  Buy yourself that fourth house, honey.  You heard it.  Bernie Bros connected in a way no other candidate's base has.  Through anger.  Through our combined hatred of Hollywood celebrities and check marks online.  through the mutual hatred between us and the media.  We've been called sexist, racist, misogynist, Nazis, brown shirts, Gamergate 2.0.  The only other base to relate to this, I think, is Trump's.  Fuck it, one struggle.  I know for a lot of you, this election is the first time you're actually getting into politics, but you got sucked in.  You can never go back.  Welcome to the world of never winning elections and being sad all the time.  Welcome to the family, bitch.  So this might come as a shock, and trust me, I don't believe it either, but there's a chance Joe Biden might actually win.  See, Trump was betting on a good economy, but as we know, line went down.  And remember, Hillary Clinton did win the popular vote.  Hillary Clinton.  won the popular vote.  And these election results and these polls have been proven that Joe Biden is more popular than Hillary.  So there is a chance Biden might win.  But who knows, the simulation we've been stuck in since 2012 has been absolutely crazy.  So although Joe Biden can't even draw a clock, his win will still be harm reduction.  The Supreme Court is important and RBG has like both feet in the grave.  That bitch is like half dead.  Joe will probably fix the situation at the border and make sure all the kids in the cages he built will be reunited with their parents.  Maybe he'll even let the transgenders back into the military to fight and die for oil just like the rest of us.  Epic win!  And unlike Trump, at least Joe Biden actually believes in climate change.  I'm sure all the money he takes from the fossil fuel industry won't be a problem at all.  And hey, remember that extremely strong anti-war movement that was created during the Bush era?  Well, they all took a nice nappy nap when Obama was elected.  So if Biden wins, we get to look forward to taking a nappy nap too.  Once Biden is in, we don't have to worry about anything.  Trump is finally off the TV.  We did it, gang.  We returned to normalcy.  It's 2015 again.  So order that mimosa, queen.  It's brunch time.  Bernie's slogan has been, not me, us.  Not to be confused with Elizabeth Warren's, not for me, but for each other.  Unbelievable.  This is not butter.  It's not about Bernie.  It's about the vision and the policies that he held.  There are many lefties, demsocks, sock dems, progressives, who will keep the movement going.  But not the tankies.  We, uh... We don't like to talk about the tankies.  But this is more than electoral politics.  Change always starts from the bottom.  Bottoms, rise up.  Get involved with your local political groups.  Get involved in your community.  I mean, I won't do that because I'm lazy as shit and antisocial as .  Honestly, most of us can't even order a pizza on the phone without having a mild panic attack.  But yeah, sure, we're gonna have a revolution.  Yeah, good, okay.  And hey, I know you're sad, but think of it this way, you'll never have to feel this way again because there'll never be another politician like Bernie Sanders, ever.  So I'm not gonna tell you how to vote, I'm not here to do that.  My friend made a really good video that she's getting a lot of hate for on the reasons why you should probably hold your nose and vote for Joe Biden, especially if you live in a swing state.  Link in the description, hear her out, because I know I would do a terrible, terrible job trying to convince someone to vote for Joe Biden.  And if you don't like Trump and you don't like Biden and you're just mad at the DNC and you want to do like a protest vote, consider voting third party.  Howie Hawkins is neat.  As for me and how I'm coping with the news, I'm pretty good.  Why do you ask?  I already knew this was going to happen.  We all knew this was going to happen.  You already know I am so negative and beyond blackpilled.  I don't feel anything.  2016 too electric boogaloo.  Let's fucking go.  Ollie, who are you voting for again?  Oh yeah, Joe Biden.  I hate my freaking dumb ass neolib rabbit. ",
