            "text": "Listen, when you're walking in your why, your what has more impact because you're walking in or towards your purpose.  The key is to understand why.  When you're walking in your why, regardless to your current circumstance, when you're walking in your why, the people around you will be moved in such a way.  It will cause them to stand up and do something.  I have always enjoyed doing comedy.  Bringing laughter to people is something I've just thoroughly, thoroughly enjoyed.  And a lot of times I'll get interviewed or something or people have these questions.  So most of the time when I do an interview, one of the questions that pops up is, hey, Michael  Jr.,  how did you get so handsome?  Well, no, not that question.  They'll say something like, hey, what was your big break?  And the answer that I give is never what they're expected, but it's completely true.  My big break wasn't when I did The Tonight Show or Jimmy Kimmel or any of these cool things or TED Talk.  It's not any of that stuff.  My big break actually took place outside of a club.  It's this story almost sounds like.  your basic big break story, but it's actually completely different.  I was outside of a club, I was in Los Angeles, all this sounds familiar, right?  But here's where it changes at.  Right before I got on stage, I had a change in mindset.  Like normally when a comedian gets on stage, we want to get laughs from people.  I was completely about getting laughs.  But I had a shift take place and I felt like instead of getting on stage to get laughs from people, I was supposed to go up there and give them an opportunity to laugh.  This literally changed everything.  Because now I'm not looking to take, I'm looking for an opportunity to give.  And I can't tell you what happened to me emotionally, even physically when I went up on stage.  I wasn't in a rush anymore.  I moved much, much slower.  Because when you have a gift for someone, you don't just shove the gift in their face.  You wait.  You wait until the time is right so you can present the gift when it's needed.  I just instinctively understood that.  So I go up on stage that night.  We have a great time.  We laugh.  It just feels different.  And I leave the club that night and there's people outside.  They want autographs and they're doing the same stuff that they would normally do with taking pictures or whatnot.  And I remember looking across the street and I saw a homeless guy.  Now, I played this club many times before, but I'd never seen a homeless guy outside the club before.  But that doesn't mean he wasn't there before.  That just means before, the question I was asking, my mindset was, how can I get laughs from people, so why would I even notice him?  But as soon as I asked the question, how could I give him an opportunity to laugh, then I started noticing it.  It's like when you're getting ready to buy a new car, and suddenly, you're buying a Toyota, and you never saw that Toyota before.  Now, suddenly, you're seeing that car all over the place.  Or right now, if I said the color green and you looked around the room, you'd find the color green more than you had noticed before.  So when I changed my mindset and I asked a different question, how can I give an opportunity to laugh?  I saw this homeless guy and I was like, what about him?  How could I give him an opportunity to laugh?  And it kind of changed everything.  And it's changed my career, literally.  Because when I'm on stage or even right here sitting in this chair, the question I'm asking even for you is, how can I give these people an opportunity to laugh?  In fact, since then, I've shortened up the question, actually.  I stop asking, how can I give people an opportunity to laugh and start asking, what can I give to my audience?  which is exactly the question you should be asking on a regular basis.  Because when you ask that question, it changes the game.  And I know some of you guys are already giving in some really significant ways, but if you actually sit back and address that question as a whole for your entire life, you're probably going to find some different answers on how you can truly, truly give to someone else.  I'd like to explain to you how life works, at least from a comedian's perspective. ",

Your setup is about what you've received.  But what if I asked you the question, what is your punchline?  Because your punchline is about what you're called to deliver.  And if you know your setup, which we all do, but you don't know your punchline, you'll realize that something's missing.  And what you'll try to do to fill that void is you'll think you need more setup.  But what you really need to do, you need to know what is your punchline.  And please understand, just like me struggling with my reading as a child, your setbacks are part of your setup so you can deliver the punchline you're called to deliver.  Much like a slingshot, the further you've been set back, the further you're going to reach. ",
