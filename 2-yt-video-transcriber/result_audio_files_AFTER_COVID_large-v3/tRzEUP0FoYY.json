            "text": "China's mighty Yangtze River nears crest again.  New floods feared.  What does that mean for your future?  Well, as China counts the cost of its most punishing flood season in more than three decades, the role played by the massive, controversial Three Gorges Dam designed to help tame the Yangtze River has come under fresh scrutiny.  amid some of the heaviest rainfall on record ever in recorded history.  The biggest hydroelectric plant has reduced flood peaks, minimized economic losses, and slashed the number of deaths in emergency evacuations.  Are you picking that up from this picture?  The critics say, The exact opposite.  The historical high water levels on the Yangtze and its major lakes proves the Three Gorges Dam is not doing what it was designed for, period.  Now, China's mighty Yangtze is heaving from the rainfall in the Three Gorges.  It will be tested.  Since June 1st, historic floods have affected more than 45 million people in 27 provinces.  One of the major justifications for the Three Gorges Dam was flood control.  But less than 20 years after its completion, we have had the highest flood water in recorded history, said David Chencom, a geographer with the University of Alabama who studies Chinese floods.  The fact is that it cannot prevent these severe events.  In fact, it creates them.  Now, Yi Shanshong, China's Vice Minister of Water Resources said Monday, the detailed scheduling of water discharge from reservoirs, particularly the Three Gorges Dam, has been effective in controlling the floods.  He said 64.7 billion meters of floodwater has been stored in 2,297 reservoirs, including 2.9 billion cubic meters at Three Gorges.  Now, what that means is that the dams is 45 feet higher than flood level, and everyone behind it, well, if they're in the floodplain, they're buried.  Now, record floods raise questions about China's Three Gorges Dam as early as July 14th.  As 14 were reported dead as water peaked during the first peak flooding on the 16th, here it's reported on the 18th.  And now here we are at the 25th, where the rivers are peaking again.  Look at these pictures coming out after the 21st.  Now we have some video from the 22nd.  This is Qingshan Bridge.  The first gate has been opened.  It's over there.  The water keeps flowing down.  Look below, it's all water.  Now what he's saying right there is that they're totally fluxed Basically, so that's what I'm getting from that video.  I don't know why this is parsing.  Hey stop clicking around cuz I need to show you.  Oh, it's because we got a commercial.  Well, that's the end of that video, which apparently was a schmideo.  Now, China admits the Three Gorges Dam has deformed by flood, but not because of these pictures from space.  You remember these pictures coming out last week?  Let's take a quick look at this.  I think some of my comrades even reported on this.  This is called disassociation through satellite imagery.  I look today, and it looks just as flat as ever to the right here.  This was just a bad day on satellite imagery.  This is not what the Three Gorges Dam looks like for real.  This is what it looks like today, straight here to the right.  I went and checked it out for good measure, but let's hear what they have to say today.  This news outlet used a picture that was Taiwan news, used a picture from weeks ago.  that was circulating on the internet.  And it's for good reason, because according to Taiwan News, a video showing the consequences of the catastrophic failure of the Three Gorges Dam has quickly gone viral.  And this is not the actual destruction of the dam, but it's merely, well, anyway, you know what it is.  According to the Chinese government, 45.2 million people have been affected by the floods that have ravaged 27 provinces along the Yangtze River, Huai River, and Yellow River, as well as the southern China since the start of June.  Many have cast doubt on the integrity of the dam.  But according to this report, and I want to bring you here.  I think they've changed.  The verbiage has changed since the last time I looked here.  But the data following the estimates for actual reference, the video states that after the dam breaks, a wall of water with a height of 100 meters will rapidly be discharged.  Now, this is just speculation because no one knows what will happen if this dam breaks.  What we do know has happened from the dam's construction is that millions of people have been affected.  But let's watch if the Three Gorges Dam breaks.  This will be the result.  And it's not in very high resolution, I warn you.  But it has wonderful music.  Hope you got something out of that little role play.  The fact is that the Three Gorges Dam could potentially be the flexure point for the new world.  And the fact that we have little information coming in allows you to understand that proper prior preparation prevents piss-poor performance during World War III.  Hope you got something out of the video.  Subscribe to the channel if you haven't.  Share this with like-minded people and be safe.  We love each and every one of you.  The world we live in is not the world you used to live in.  It is the new world.  Be safe. ",
