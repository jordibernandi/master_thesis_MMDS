            "text": "Last week Donald Trump announced that he tested positive for the coronavirus.  If you're like me, your initial response was, Oh my god!  But is that an appropriate response?  Yes!  It totally is!  Sorry?  My humanity and my schadenfreude are battling it out.  Guess which one's winning?  Okay, maybe it's not appropriate or okay to be glad that Trump has COVID \u2013 he's still a human being, after all.  Technically, so far as we know.  But it's certainly understandable, and not something I'm gonna tell you you need to feel bad about.  Because I don't feel bad about it!  I'm not\u2026.  I'm not saying you have to feel good that Trump has COVID.  If your reaction was one of sympathy, hope for recovery, I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy,  etc.,  etc.,  hey, good for you, you fucking saint.  But if you do happen to think Trump testing positive for COVID-19 is a happy development, perhaps even one worth celebrating?  That doesn't make you a bad person, and I, a random white dude on the internet and as such one of the most respected and deferred to oracles in our culture, am here to tell you why.  There are several reasons why I think treating Trump's COVID test result as good news is an understandable thing to do, but they all branch off of one big reason, and that big reason is Donald Trump is a horrible person.  I know his supporters will insist on framing that as a biased, partisan political statement, but it's not.  And also, I don't care how Trump's supporters frame it, because they're horrible people, too.  What's your excuse now?  Is it still economic anxiety?  Let's do a quick review.  Since he's been president, Donald Trump has attempted to ban Muslims from entering the country, instituted a zero-tolerance immigration policy along the southern border which resulted in children of undocumented immigrants and asylum seekers being separated from their families and, in many cases, not returned, he obstructed justice by repeatedly attempting to interfere in an investigation of him and his associates, investigation which ultimately led to him being impeached.  He used the power of presidential pardon as well as a sycophantic attorney general to help his friends escape the consequences of their crimes.  He, it was recently revealed, paid little to no federal income tax during the last two decades, despite repeatedly insisting the opposite and boasting of his wealth and and business success.  He has, according to reporting that has been corroborated by multiple news agencies, referred to dead American soldiers as suckers and losers.  He has refused to commit to a peaceful transfer of power, should he lose the election, and has repeatedly used the platform of the presidency to cast doubt on the legitimacy of the election, particularly the process of voting by mail on the basis of no evidence whatsoever.  He has repeatedly failed to convincingly condemn and disavow white supremacy, which has seen a massive resurgence during his presidency, thanks in large part to white supremacists perceiving Trump to be one of them.  An accurate perception, if you ask me, by the way.  And he has presided over a cruel, misguided, and inexcusably botched federal response to the coronavirus pandemic that has resulted in the deaths of more than 200,000 Americans so far.  And those are just the lowlights of the lowlights.  Think of how much I left out.  Which of those things is only bad when viewed through a politically partisan lens?  Is there something about the government taking people's children without justification and not giving them back?  that makes it okay if you're a Republican?  There's apparently something about being a Republican that makes it seem okay, but that's not what I'm talking about.  My point is, the things about Donald Trump that make him a shitty person \u2013 the things he said, the actions he's taken or refused to take \u2013 ought to be perceived as bad no matter where you stand on the political spectrum.  You say you're a small government conservative who believes in low taxes and laissez-faire economic policy?  Okay.  What about that?  makes it okay to court the Nazi vote?  Trump's supporters have continued to hand-wave his many offenses and character flaws, but that doesn't mean the rest of us have to go along with it.  Trump is continuously doing and saying cruel, ignorant, irresponsible things \u2013 things that hurt people and threaten the future of the country.  Calling him a horrible person isn't a partisan political statement.  It's a statement of fact.  Okay, okay, it's not a statement of fact, it's an opinion, but it's an opinion that doesn't depend on any particular political viewpoint to make sense.  There.  Ya happy?  Of course, the primary way in which Trump has exhibited his horrendous character, or lack thereof, recently has been through this response to the coronavirus pandemic, which makes the fact that he has now tested positive for the virus extra delicious.  to those of us who have a taste for such things.  It's not good news just because Trump is a terrible person.  It's also good news if you have an appreciation for irony.  Last week, Cornell University released a study which found that Donald Trump was, quote, likely the largest driver of COVID-19 misinformation.  He has consistently downplayed the threat of the virus, even though we now know, thanks to recorded interviews with Bob Woodward, that Trump was fully aware of how dangerous the virus was from the beginning.  He's insisted that the virus will just magically go away one day.  He's mocked people for wearing masks.  He's hyped bogus miracle cures.  He's sought to minimize the impact of the virus, treating the hundreds of thousands of COVID-related deaths as an inevitable fact of life rather than something that he could have helped to prevent.  And he's continued to hold large, public rallies with no mask requirements and no social distancing, sometimes in violation of local guidelines against such events.  In other words, the guy who spent the last six months responding to the virus by telling everybody that it's not a big deal has got the virus.  I don't believe in karma, but it's nice how sometimes things just sort of work out.  You know?  Let's also remember how Trump himself has responded when misfortune has befallen his political opponents.  During the 2016 presidential campaign, he infamously mocked the disability of journalist Serge Kovalevsky, who has arthrogryposis.  He also made fun of Hillary Clinton for stumbling during a 9-11 memorial.  Turns out she had pneumonia!  And just last week, during the first presidential debate, he seized on Joe Biden talking about his son Beau, who died of brain cancer in 2015, as an opportunity to attack Biden's other son, Hunter, for having a drug problem.  It's pretty shameless for Trump supporters to demand sensitivity and compassion for Trump in the wake of his COVID diagnosis, when Trump himself doesn't seem to possess either quality.  It's especially shameless since so many of them seem to regard his utter lack of those qualities as a strength.  Then again, shamelessness is a quality Trump possesses in abundance, and most of his supporters seem to admire that about him, too.  Now, like I said, if your reaction to hearing that Trump has COVID and is apparently showing symptoms and might even die?  is less giddy elation and more somber concern for the life of a fellow human being, however contemptible that human being may be, I'm certainly not going to think less of you for that.  You're probably a better person than I am.  However, I am at the very least going to make this suggestion.  Keep your well wishes to yourself.  Because it's one thing to feel an instinctive swell of compassion regarding the plight of a suffering person.  It's another to publicly display sympathy for them, especially if that person has contributed to far greater suffering than that which they are experiencing.  Yes, I know Joe Biden already wished Trump a speedy recovery, but Joe's got bipartisanship the way some people have allergies.  Poor guy.  Just can't ever seem to get over it.  Plus, Biden is running for president, and the Republicans are already trying to paint anyone who didn't run right out and attend a prayer vigil for Trump as a cold-hearted bastard who wishes for the deaths of their political adversaries.  And, I mean, we're not all like that.  So showing some class instead of kicking Trump when he's down makes sense from a strategic point of view as well.  But before those of you who aren't running for president decide to publicly wish Trump well in his battle against the disease he spent most of this year telling people not to worry about, consider who Donald Trump is.  Who it is you're wishing well.  He's a liar, he's corrupt, he celebrates the use of violence against people he doesn't like.  while exaggerating or outright fabricating incidents of violence committed by people protesting him, he threatens political opponents with investigation, prosecution, imprisonment.  He threatens to withhold federal funding from states and cities that displease him.  He has allowed white nationalists like Stephen Miller to set policy.  He has vilified immigrants and refugees, followers of non-Christian religions and people of color, while simultaneously insisting that he is a friend of all those groups.  He has damaged the standing of the United States in the world, alienated some of our closest allies, arbitrarily withdrawn from international agreements, openly praised and supported dictators while insulting democratically elected leaders, and pursued an agenda of xenophobia, isolationism, and nationalism.  In other words, Donald Trump is a fascist who routinely acts to destabilize and delegitimize the essential systems of our democracy.  If you say something nice about him, even something as basic as, I hope he doesn't die, you are sending the message that he is the sort of person about whom nice things ought to be said.  And he's not.  But the problem isn't just that he doesn't deserve it.  Saying nice things about Donald Trump helps to normalize him, to legitimize him, and he's been plenty normalized and legitimized already, thank you very the fuck much.  Look, if you say nice things about Donald Trump, that helps him.  Maybe not much, because you're only one person, but it adds up.  If people don't say nice things about him, he'll just make up some imaginary people who said nice things about him and talk about them for twice as long as he talks about the real people who think he's the shits, because that's what he does.  He waves off his failures and invents fictional successes he can crow about instead.  So you keeping your hopes for his recovery to yourself doesn't actually hurt anything.  And, to be honest, you expressing those hopes isn't going to accomplish anything good.  It's not as though Trump is gonna see a bunch of liberals and leftists putting politics aside to wish him well and suddenly go, wow, they're actually good people.  after all, I'm gonna stop setting the world on fire.  Not even catching COVID has changed him, like, at all.  Over the weekend, against the advice of the CDC and all standards of responsibility and human decency, he left the hospital so he could take a limo ride and wave to supporters who had gathered outside, exposing everyone in that car with him to his infection.  Let me say that again.  He left the hospital and exposed people to his virus for no reason.  It wasn't an emergency situation where they had to move the president somewhere, he just felt like a bit of an outing.  And when announcing that he was being discharged from Walter Reed, he tweeted, in the wake of over 200,000 American COVID deaths, I remind you, quote, Don't be afraid of COVID.  Don't let it dominate your life.  He hasn't learned anything.  He can't learn anything.  And apparently, even after the President of the United States and several people who work for him and multiple Republican senators contracted the virus, the Trump officials who run the White House aren't changing any protocols to protect others from infection, either.  Reportedly, staffers are still mostly working without masks, not practicing social distancing, screenings of people entering the White House for possible signs of infection have not been increased.  It's like they're still just pretending it isn't happening!  This is who you're sending your best wishes to?  Your best wishes?  How bad does somebody have to fuck up to get a worst wish?  Or even a mediocre wish, like if somebody burned down an orphanage with everyone inside, then caught the Ebola virus?  Would you be like, oh, well, nobody deserves to bleed to death out of their mucous membranes and eyes, so I hope he gets better soon, but I also hope the next time he goes to see a movie he gets there late and the only seats left are the ones right up front.  Although, who knows when he could even go see a movie next, since people aren't really seeing movies in theaters right now, because of the pandemic that is still a national public health emergency thanks to the callousness and incompetence of the president to whom you're wishing a speedy recovery.  Fuck you, speedy recovery sign guy!  Trump's a bad person.  And the people who work for him and support him are bad people.  He's a reckless, irresponsible, narcissistic, ignorant, malicious, very, very, very bad person who is never, ever going to change.  And you know that, right?  You're only really saying nice things about Trump so that the rest of us can see you doing it, and know how gracious you are, how you're willing to put your personal feelings aside and take the high road and say, hey, not even Donald Trump deserves to contract a potentially deadly virus, come on, let's all try to be better than that.  You're not saying it for Trump.  You're saying it for you, aren't you?  So maybe don't?  Because you're not helping.  Or at least, you're not helping anyone who ought to be helped.  Pity the sick and the dead, not the guy who had some bad luck after afflicting them. ",
