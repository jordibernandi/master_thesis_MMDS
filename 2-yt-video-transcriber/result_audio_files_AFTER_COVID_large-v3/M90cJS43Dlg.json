What's that?  Where's everybody's mask?  The cops?  Do they not give a shit about the public?  That's a perception.  There's no need for that foul language.  There's no one speaking in any... Five more to go!  Woo!  Pass up!  They got a bunch of what appears to be suspected gang members there.  What's that mean?  Watch how nervous the cops get with the camera.  One of the people.  that makes sure.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm live on YouTube right now.  You're live on YouTube.  Yeah.  We've got 277 people watching.  And... Making sure they obey their own law.  Oh, no, man, because... Listen, if I were up against that fence, I would want someone to figure out filming.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Well, some of them are right by the tent, and they were just eating.  Yeah.  Good evening.  How are you doing?  What do you need?  Everything okay?  Yeah.  Do you need something?  Sir, with the camera.  Whoa, he's in public.  Tell me.  So what?  I'm in my house.  I'm not speaking.  So what?  If you can do me a favor, you can record all you want, but if you can do me a favor, can you wait like at the corner?  No, he doesn't have to.  I know he doesn't have to.

Where's everybody's mask?  The cops?  Do they not give a shit about the public?  That's the perception.  There's no need for that foul language, sir.  No one's speaking in any foul language.  I'll play the video back for you if you want also.  Thanks for your cooperation, sir.  It's still not too late for them to put masks on.  That's it.  So let me get this straight.  So there's a guy right here in his yard with his girlfriend or wife or roommate, but then a guy with a camera shows up and is the exact same distance away, but all of a sudden I am a threat to the police.  I'm talking.  Stop talking.  I'm talking to my audience right now.  I'm talking to my audience right now.  You're interrupting.  I'm doing a voiceover. ",

And yet he's worried about the perception of police more than his crime scene.  Apparently Van Nuys Division needs public relations more than they need to do their actual jobs of policing and keeping us all safe.  Do not come over to me and ask me to move for officer safety if you're not all wearing masks and all you really care about is trying to bully your way into my voiceover to tell your side of the story.  Nobody cares Castillo.  Nobody except corrupt police. ",

What did you just say?  Sir, sir, stop talking.  Stop talking.  You can have a dialogue and a discussion.  Wear the masks.  Wear the masks on the officers.  What's your name, sir?  If you want to just give a one-sided version, that's okay also.  What's your name, sir?  What's your name, sir?  Sergeant Castillo.  Serial number, please.  Would you like a business card?  No, I don't want anything that you've touched.  No offense, but all your officers are not wearing masks.  That's for my safety.  It's for citizen safety.  You guys are always talking about officer safety.  I see them all wearing masks.  Oh, yeah?  Interesting.  I've been on several other calls tonight.  You guys out of North Hollywood or Van Nuys?  Like I said, I'm more than happy to give you a business card.  No, I don't want anything you've touched.  Hey, well, you guys should probably not start beating innocent protesters.  That would probably be a start.  No, we're doing nothing.  We're just hanging out.  Castillo, you lost the support of white people in the last two weeks.  That was the last people that were in your corner.  Well, it's the truth.  Okay, cool story.  Sometimes it's better to have all the facts.  I saw all the facts.  I saw people getting beat over on the Fairfax district with clubs for peacefully protesting.  We don't carry clubs, but okay.  That's the great thing about this country.  Everyone can have their perspective and opinion. ",

Yeah, the last people that LAPD had rooting for them were white people.  People of color have lost their confidence in policing decades ago.  And like I said, there are soccer moms now that had a back of the blue bumper sticker, tore that off, and went out and got a neck tattoo that says, fuck the police.  So they lost the support of white people.  a vast majority of them, by their own actions.  Airship is up.  Airship is up right behind us.  might be coming.  oh my god he's playing.  oh god this is great.  Yeah.  Hey, that sergeant didn't ask you to move away, did he?  No.  No?  You were standing the same distance away?  Yeah, I was getting closer.  It's funny.  He only singled out the guy with the camera to move away.  Funny how that works.  Yeah, man.  He couldn't say anything to the guy that was in his yard.  No.  I mean, you know, same distance.  I mean, if your argument is that you don't feel safe for your officers, then... How can I not feel safe?  How many are there?  Yeah, I know.  There's so many of them, and everybody has them up there.  Yeah.  How can they not... Yeah.  How many... How many ambushes of police have ever happened from photographers shooting a live YouTube stream?  Zero... Yeah, no, no, he doesn't, he doesn't, he doesn't like it.  Thanks for the soundtrack, bro.  Dude, that was... That was perfect.  That was awesome, dude.  I had to, I had to mute, I had to mute, uh, my, uh, um, stream because... No, because, uh, YouTube has copyright shit, but I couldn't put that on.  But, uh... I'm gonna play Psychic Friends Network, and if we do do a Freedom of Information Act on the body cams, they're all gonna magically, um, not be working.  I am a big dog.  Can I put your dog on camera?  I am a big dog trapped in a small body.  Yes, I am.  I'll take you.  I will take you, Mr.  Baldy.  I will take you.  Well, if the ticket was just for public intoxication or open container, they should just cite them and let them go.  Yeah.  But we've been here for 30.  They've been here for 30 minutes.  I've been here for 15.  Yeah, they just want to.  they just want to exert their authority.  Let them know who's boss.  Oh, is he searching that car?  Can you do it?  You should only if he gets consent.  I wonder if I wonder if Castillo knows Officer Lee.  The guy who planted cocaine on the hit-and-run driver in 2014.  2016, I don't know when.  so here's the deal guys.  so they give them a bs ticket of open container and then when they don't show up in court for the that ticket now they have a warrant for their arrest.  now they can go out and arrest the guy.  so it's not as you know.  uh mr rogers as it appears there's method to the madness.  oh look they're shooting their picture For their gang database.  I guarantee you that an LAPD has a bad history of putting people in the gang database that are not gang members.  It's the latest LAPD scandal before they started beating people, peaceful protesters with batons.  There they go.  There were three guys.  Oh, no, there's a fourth guy.  Castillo couldn't help himself, could he?  What did he say?  Thanks for filming the police?  Some bullshit?  Well, if cops weren't so crooked, there would be no such thing as cop watchers.  The fire department does not get followed around to make sure that they don't commit crime.  So nobody follows the fire department around making sure they don't commit crime or arson. ",
