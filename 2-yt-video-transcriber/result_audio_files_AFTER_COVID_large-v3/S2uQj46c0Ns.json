            "text": "Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.  I'm here with some kind of abomination that I found in a medical waste facility behind an abortion clinic.  Good to see you, hideous discharge of the devil's own bloody nightmare fuel.  Boy, Elmo's so glad that you're here.  Elmo wants to know more about what's happening.  Who's Elmo?  How are people being treated unfairly?  How are people being treated unfairly?  Good question.  Terrifying apparition.  You may tell this Elmer of yours to turn around and look out of the window.  Daddy, Elmo doesn't understand.  What's happening?  Why are all these people together?  Well... anonymous interface for some kind of dissociated superego named elmo and please do not call me daddy.  you've asked a very shrewd question now.  why are all these people together in public in close quarters and without masks Achieving absolutely nothing that in any universe could be sincerely called essential.  Why is that writhing hellscape going on?  We could have sworn we were given strict instructions to keep up this melodramatic pretense that we all need to be quarantined.  Even those of us who happen to be puppets on public broadcast television.  Even children's puppets are pretending to be talking at convoluted Zoom conferences, lest they risk giving your children the harmful impression that this new normal is in some way not normal.  Perish the very thought.  This pandemic is such a dire emergency that we are putting our entire education system in economic and existential ruin over it.  So why indeed... Are we all turning three blind eyes to the photovoltaic syzygy of squawking masses outside, breaking all these rules and also breaking several laws?  Why do they get to viciously beat pieces of brain out of innocent people's skulls as evil bottom feeders in the media blanch their brains in a cauldron of boiling Gatorade to try and convince us that nothing's getting damaged except property?  And the answer is... They are doing it for the sake of a riot.  Protest?  No, riot.  Elmo doesn't understand.  What's a protest?  How very adorable.  I suppose it shouldn't surprise me that the world could show you a violently erupting dingo of political subversion and your brain will only see a protest.  I mean, you spent several decades learning the English language and you still can't get the hang of speaking in the first person.  I'm looking at you, but I'm talking to so many people. ",

For all I know, he might be in the euphoric part of the coma.  But anyway, we're three minutes into an unrelated topic.  It's high time we talk about racism.  Racism?  What's that?  Racism is when you make an issue of race when race is not an issue.  That is all it has ever needed to mean.  That is all it has ever served us to mean.  As such, I refuse any newfangled revisionist baggage in which you may have smothered it since.  And I get to, because I'm old.  But to put it as pithily as possible, those sad protesters out there firmly believe that the color of their skin is indeed higher on their moral agenda than the outdated and white supremacist notion of the quote-unquote content of their character.  The color of their skin?  Oh, Elmo doesn't understand, Daddy.  To repeat, please do not call me Daddy.  To be honest, I don't know if you're even talking to me, because I don't know if I'm talking to you or Elmer.  What I appear to be trying to walk you through is something that would ordinarily override the talents of a very expensive psychiatrist, Elmer.  May I call you Elmer?  Yeah, I got all the way to the $64,000 question, and I did it pro bono.  Anyway, I seem to have veered us away from the subject of racism for another grueling handful of precious seconds.  You were saying... Elmo has friends with different types of skin.  Oh, and fur, too.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  What you've said?  there is a loose rephrasing of the well-known clich\u00e9, I'm not racist, some of my best friends are black.  That has long been established as a racist thing to say.  Do you see?  I've still no idea why, but someone out there can think it up, and they can explain to you how you are now guilty of racist hate speech.  As you can see, there is a trap in every corridor, and even you, Elmer, whom we can only honestly interpret as a 40-year-old with the arrested mental development of a three-and-a-half-year-old, even you can surely see... that this dungeon of booby traps that has been laid to ensnare each and every one of us indiscriminately, eventually, is itself an artifact of that which I call racism.  Your friend Oscar has been arrested for public indecency because he refused to take a stand.  And now Chase has closed his savings account.  When is enough enough, Elmer?  When is getting us there, never getting us there, can you tell me?  Elmo wants to end racism too.  Good call.  The first step is quit doing this kind of bollocks.  Elmo wants everybody to be treated fairly.  You people have been talking about racism since the 80s.  And the message every time was a solid, clear, talk-to-me-like-I'm-five, gather-round children, all lives matter.  It is only this year in which that narrative has mysteriously switched to a crucially different one.  So to clarify my summary, whichever one of you punks has got a glock to Elmer's head, I will find you. ",
