I want to say, first of all, thank you both for being here, and I appreciate it.  Sidney, let's start with this election process.  We just heard from John Solomon that the FBI indeed is being diligent, is involved, and we all hope he is exactly right.  Your thoughts first about the knowledge now that the Justice Department is involved in this review of the election. ",

I think there are any number of things they need to investigate, including the likelihood that 3 percent of the vote total was changed in the pre-election voting ballots that were collected digitally by using the Hammer program and a software program called Scorecard.  That would have amounted to a massive change in the vote.  that would have gone across the country and explains a lot of what we're seeing.  In addition, they ran an algorithm to calculate votes they might need to come up with for Mr.  Biden in specific areas.  I think that explains what happened in Michigan, where the computer glitch resulted in a change of votes of about 40%.  5,500 in favor of President Trump, just in one of 47 districts.  All those districts need to be checked for that same, quote, software glitch, end quote, that would change the result in Michigan dramatically.  The same thing is happening in other states.  We've had hundreds of thousands of ballots mysteriously appear solely for Mr.  Biden, which is statistically impossible as a matter of mathematics.  It can all be documented.  We are putting it into materials that we will file in federal court, and we need to seek relief in multiple states to enjoin the certification of any election results. ",

You know, I go back to the numbers you reported at the beginning of the segment.  The president was winning on Tuesday.  He's not winning now.  And he's not winning now as a result of a process that the voters can't have confidence in.  The state legislatures can't have confidence in.  In my view, the courts can't have confidence in.  So the question is, are the courts going to undo what went on?  I DON'T KNOW.  BUT THE STATE LEGISLATURES IN GEORGIA, PENNSYLVANIA, MICHIGAN, WISCONSIN, PERHAPS ARIZONA, THEY NOW HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A STAND ON BEHALF OF THE RULE OF LAW.  ARE THEY GOING TO ENDORSE WHAT WENT ON THIS WEEK OR ARE THEY GOING TO APPOINT A CLEAN SLATE OF ELECTORS THAT SUPPORTS PRESIDENT TRUMP?  That could be the next battle.  And I would think that activists interested in this issue, and if you're concerned watching this, start talking to your state legislators.  And I started asking where Congress is, because Congress in the end is going to be the judge of the electoral college votes.  And if I were in Congress, I'd be telling these states, you better keep up on, you better be honest here, because we're not going to accept your votes if your election is a sham. ",

They were used by the forces in the Democratic operatives that had access to these programs through the government access points that they have and used it illegally to change votes in this country.  It's got to be investigated probably by the president's most trusted military intelligence officials who can get into the system and see what was done.  But we do have some evidence that that is exactly what happened.  And they've used it against other entities in other countries.  It's just been turned recently against our own citizens here to change election results.  It's absolutely appalling that that can be done.  And whether it's called computer glitches or something else, somebody has actually gone into the system and changed voting results. ",

What can we do about it?  Because the Department of Justice, I mean, if there's evidence of that program, why not just turn it over to the Justice Department and go to the courts and say, this has got to stop now.

Coup 5.0, Lou, I mean, there was no reason to think that the Democratic operatives who spent hundreds of millions of dollars creating the Russia hoax, the Steele dossier, taking us through a special counsel operation for two years, trying an impeachment hoax, the apocalypse hoax, the obstruction hoax.  wouldn't go so far as to create every means of voter fraud they could come up with to steal this election.  That's exactly what happens.  The president must fight back now in every way, shape or form.  We cannot let this republic be stolen by the Democratic operatives who want to destroy the republic and make it a socialist country where they continue to line their pockets with these backdoor global deals like the Biden laptop from hell exposes.
