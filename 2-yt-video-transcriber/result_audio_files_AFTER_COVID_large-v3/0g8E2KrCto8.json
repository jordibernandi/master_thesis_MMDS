            "text": "The thing that caused the most tears in our home from the seizure on was the tangible love of God made evidence in the saints.  I mean, we've got, we had a picture sent to us from Yei Sudan of five pastors in Sudan on their knees on a dirt floor with their hands raised asking God to heal me.  We got house church pastors in Burma that sent us letters.  A group of orphans in Mexico holding up a sign that says, we love you, Pastor Chandler.  And so, man, I'd get those things.  I didn't have anywhere to even spiritually file that.  So we would just weep and thank God that he was loving us through those.  And then the lines that were crossed.  And you know, I mean, the kingdom, God help us.  Holy Spirit help us.  We're just so, we've been trained to see through the lenses of what's wrong with it.  So we look at other pastors, other ministries, through the lenses of what's wrong with it first.  And so to have this camp that doesn't work well with this camp, that doesn't like this camp, that hates this camp, all to be going, we love you and we're praying for you.  And then to be able to go, okay, maybe I can be a bridge here in some of this.  I mean, it's beautiful. ",
