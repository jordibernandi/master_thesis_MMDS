            "text": "This is it, baby.  Three weeks, we got the presidential election.  You know, what could go wrong?  Dude, we both look like cops.  Yeah, we do.  It's just that we're a bad two dudes to be walking around any of these cities if shit goes down.  This is making me like him more.  It's the only other place I can live, baby.  The great state of Florida.  Oh, this is sick.  Me and Dan usually do Airbnbs.  This time we got a room.  So, you know, if one of us fucks somebody, we have to wait outside.  But we just got a few more weeks.  A couple of big podcasts are about to happen.  I'm doing a podcast with Joe Rogan and Alex Jones next week.  and an election special, so I'm sure no one will get mad about that.  Do you need anything?  No, we're perfect right now.  Okay.  Fluffy bobblehead.  Fluffy sold out a club in like 20 minutes by just tweeting it out in San Antonio, and then the next night I performed for like 12 people, and then I realized that like, man, I gotta step my fucking game up.  We're back with Tim Dillon, everybody!  We just did a podcast.  We just filmed a... We just recorded... I'm, like, delirious.  We did two shows.  I did two hours.  Dan did 20 minutes on each show, which is impressive.  We still have about four and a half minutes of material.  And then I just did a podcast.  We did a 50-minute podcast.  It's what we got to do.  We got to... And I think it was decent, you know?  And obviously, maybe not the greatest thing I've recorded, but this is what we got to do.  We have one Patreon podcast a week and one filmed podcast a week for YouTube.  And then... You know, stand up.  Stand up most days.  What does your shirt say?  End of the Wu-Tang?  I just, I want to pay black people to kill you.  I want to go on Reddit and let black teenagers to come and kill you after this show.  Hey, my name is Tim Dillon.  Thank you guys so much.  Not Tim Dillon, is it?  Yeah.  Tim Dillon.  Come here, dude.  Yeah.  Give me a little bit.  How are you?  How are you?  I love your shit.  Thank you, brother.  Billy Powers.  Thank you.  What's up?  Who's Tim Dillon?  Tim Dillon is... The Steakhouse Rant.  You know the Steakhouse Rant?  Tim Dillon.  Tim Dillon.  So hold on.  Please don't film this.  When I was in the ocean and it was raining, it was like one of the most beautiful things.  I was in the ocean.  It was raining.  It was one of the most beautiful things.  And there was a couple that had just gotten engaged.  And I'm in my underwear and I'm just in the ocean and I'm going like this.  It's like the Shawshank Redemption.  I'm doing that scene from Shawshank Redemption.  I'm in the background of all of their photos.  And I'm just screaming at Dan, it's the Shawshank Redemption.  And this is the happiest moment in their life.  They literally turned around and looked at me.  And I'm just shirt off like, this is the scene from the Shawshank Redemption.  And it's moments like that that make this country beautiful.  Yo, what up?  What's up?  We're in the car.  We're in West Palm Beach.  I sent Rush Limbaugh an email.  He's dying of cancer.  I want to interview him.  I've been listening to him since I was 12 years old.  I don't think he's going to respond, but I'd love to talk to him even off air.  You ever listen to Rush?  A little bit.  A little bit.  Mostly through you.  He's a liar.  He lied.  We do this all day.  The lying has to end.  Listen, man, whether you love or hate Rush, he's one of the biggest broadcasters that's ever lived.  I'd love to fucking sit down and talk to him.  Blow cigarette smoke in his face.  You have some other pretty big interviews coming up.  I have a big podcast coming up with Rogan and Alex Jones.  It's going to be happening on Monday.  It is now Friday.  It's a little wild because I'm sitting next to Alex, who I've been listening to forever, but who is the most volatile person on the planet.  Also the funniest.  So I'm trying to be funny next to the funniest dude.  No one's funnier than him.  He's not trying, but he's funny.  And we're a week out from the most contentious election in American history.  So in terms of podcasts, it'll be the biggest thing I think I've ever done.  So it is a little nerve-wracking being like, dude, what the fuck?  What's this going to look like?  Are people going to be like, Tim Dillon's a monster for doing it?  Who cares?  Whatever.  But it's been making me a little anxious.  You know, Dan has probably noticed that to a degree.  Yes.  Have you noticed?  Have you noticed that I've been kind of tense lately?  The armor is strong, but there's a little bit of tension.  There's a little bit of anxiety.  Rightfully so.  I started this tour a non-smoker.  I was doing keto.  This morning we had pancakes and cigarettes for breakfast.  I'm just a little tense.  You want to say shit that's funny and that you mean right now.  Because neither one of these candidates is good.  And I don't want to give anybody the idea that either one of them is good.  And Alex is all in for Trump.  And I'm telling people, make your own decision.  I don't really give a fuck what you do.  There's negatives to either one of these guys getting elected.  And there's probably positives to either one of these guys getting elected.  Who the fuck wants to hear that, though?  So I better just be fucking funny.  Okay.  Yeah, this is exactly what I used to do.  Come on.  So that's in there.  This is cocaine.  This is you say, I want to buy an eight ball of cocaine.  I want to cut it up.  I want to sniff it.  And then I want to peek out of the blinds and look at the parked cars on the street and wonder which ones of them are undercover cops.  And I did that for 10 years of my life.  And it's not that bad.  You know the one thing about this state?  The fucking humidity.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They started asking us when we want green rooms, and we eat these protein bars that taste like cookies and cream, that taste like chocolate candy bars.  So now we're just gonna have that, and then hopefully we got some yogurts.  I requested fahe yogurts.  They're faggot yogurts.  It's actually, it's Greek yogurt, but it's the cum.  Alex Jones just texted me, he's like, if you're in Austin early, come have dinner with me.  Let's do dinner and drinks.  So we may be doing that, so.  Cheers!  Cheers!  Hey, what's up, everybody?  My voice is going and I am really trying to do the best I can here.  We got we got halls for the voice.  We've got fucking room temperature water for the voice.  with Marlboro Lights.  But we are in Palm Beach right now.  We're trying to do a quick video outside of Jeffrey Epstein's mansion.  Jeff, you slain?  It's gonna be a little tough.  People have told us that the cops will come right away.  There might be like Palm Beach private security.  There is fucking construction going on in the house next to his or... It's a joint CIA-Massad front venture where it's just a bunch of agents sitting in the truck eating sandwiches.  I don't know.  You didn't get into the Epstein doc.  You watched an episode.  I watched an episode.  I was like, this is a little much.  You were never a big fan of my podcast.  I listened to your podcast.  I was never a big fan of anybody's podcast.  Okay.  What I like about you is you don't really look at the darkness underneath.  No, not too much.  Maybe a little bit, but I don't really poke that much.  Do you think that's why we're a good match?  I think so.  I don't want to say basic bitch shit, but maybe more basic bitch shit than you do.  I enjoy brunch.  I think brunch is fun.  I like it.  Is that funny?  What do you mean?  Liking brunch.  No.  It could be, actually, yes.  The fact that you hate it so much and I like it is funny.  Okay.  Yeah.  Do you know why I hate it?  Well, here's why I hate brunch.  It's confused.  Breakfasts, 90% of all breakfasts you eat are horrors.  They're a father and his divorced kid, a divorced father and his daughter at a diner.  It's a bunch of old guys in a McDonald's drinking coffee that are veterans, you know, that serve the country that doesn't care about them.  It's a substitute teacher eating an energy bar on her way to work.  It's a guy that just got out of rehab trying to get a call center job stuffing an energy drink down his throat.  90% of breakfast you eat.  And it was all in your garage.  And we used to watch Alex Jones every night, and we watched Joe Rogan every night, and we watched other people.  That we won't name.  Or to be unnamed.  And we would sit in this dark vortex, this... And the only things that would glow were the lights of these little shitty Mac minis.  And you would just see plumes of cigarette smoke.  And then the lights of this dystopian reality that was becoming like actual reality.  And we were always saying to ourselves, when will this spill over?  When does this go out into the streets?  Because all we would watch is anger and rage, which would be very funny.  But we went, when does this spill out into the streets?  And now we don't.  It was March 2020.  Now we know it was March 2020.  I mean, I used to fall asleep to Alice Jones every night.  And we would watch it late into the night.  Yeah, and I wrote a script about you.  Yeah, just talk about that.  I went crazy for like a month.  I worked maybe like 300 hours on a script where Tim is essentially playing And I handed it to you.  And you read one page of it.  And you're like, this is so fucking retarded.  You're like, we could get sued.  Of course we can't do this.  What were you thinking?  You're loosely playing out of it.  It was like 80 pages.  It was like 100 pages of full script, like a feature.  And I took it and I threw it.  I just put it on a coffee table.  I was like, well, I think you should read it.  I think it's pretty damn good.  And you're like, oh, I'm sure.  It's the first script you ever wrote.  I'm sure it'll win Oscars.  And I was like, okay.  You don't need much.  You don't need anything.  I need a schizophrenic.  Ding.  And somebody who will deal with a schizophrenic.  That's kind of all you need.  And an internet connection.  I'm excited.  The Joe Rogan experience.  Tim, motherfucking Tim.  Yeah, I'm just a kid in a candy store.  Me too.  Thank you for making this dream come true.  Have you smoked crack or just coke?  No, I've free-based cocaine, which is... Well, that's basically the same.  Yeah, it's close.  How close is it?  Not as close as where I ever went and made shady deals in the Ukraine.  Get him some apple juice for the transhumanism discussion, please.  Listen, listen.  I brought you the documents, Joe.  I'm sucking on this cigar.  Joe, we have the documents.  This is why people get banned from the internet.  These kind of conversations.  We better ban it right now.  Let's not ban it.  I'm just, I'll throw that out.  If we don't break the last record, we're going down.  What's the last record?  No, we don't have to break records.  No, Tim Dillon, you rant while I get ready.  Give us your latest comedy.  It's maybe one of the best podcast episodes ever.  Amazing.  Amazing.  I think people see Alex as a human being, which they should.  I try to be funny when I could, and we talk about some really interesting shit, and that's what a podcast should be.  Like, that's literally what a podcast should be.  It should be just a no-holds-barred conversation that nobody really, like... There's no limits.  There's no rules to what you can fucking talk about.  And everybody has, you know, their own experience or whatever.  And I think it was really fucking good.  Thank you.  He's coming in for a lemon.  We've got some sauteed spinach.  We've got some unbraten potatoes.  He's going to go ahead and cut up this pork chop right here that's been stored for six hours in a pecan wood.  It's really fantastic.  Does everything look okay?  It's beautiful.  Perfect.  I think... Purchasing high octane weaponry anonymously is my right.  So I think that's probably the biggest threat.  Like if I went to go buy an AK-47 and somebody said, hey, what's your name?  It's going up.  I just put it on Instagram and now I'm putting it on Twitter.  And Alex Jones... So fuck you to all the teachers who said I wouldn't amount to anything and all of them worked in Newton, Connecticut.  What a horrible joke.  Spotify is having a meltdown right now.  Yeah, the Frigis Land shirt's amazing.  Spotify employees in shambles.  Massive walkouts.  Going around the desert trying to get supplies for a sketch and the supplies we need are like syringes.  They think we're drug addicts, put it that way.  We're like, for a sketch, we need syringes and a spoon, a lighter for a sketch.  Let's say my wife was dead and I wanted to get rid of her body.  What chemicals would I need for a sketch?  For YouTube?  We're about to walk into Walmart.  This is more dangerous than licking the floor of the COVID wing in a hospital.  No, it's your health food Thin Mint.  It's the Fat Bomb Bar.  No, it's the health food aisle, dummy.  Mint Fat Cups.  The kids are going to love vaccines.  Every holiday, they're going to want a new one.  Where's my Easter vaccine, mommy?  And then the Easter bunny shows up and gives it to them.  So look at this.  It's a bowl of candy.  Is it?  Or is it the end of COVID?  That's right, kids.  They're cutting capacity in a lot of these clubs, so I've decided that we should basically go back when we can do full rooms, or half full at least, which is what we've been doing.  We've been doing a lot of full rooms, three quarters full.  I don't want to do 100 people in a room that seats 500.  That's not how comedy works.  But we're going down to do the Election Night podcast with Rogan.  And then we're gonna be down in Austin for that one night for the most volatile election in American history.  They're boarding up all these cities.  They are, you know, Walmart is stopping, you know, selling guns and ammunition.  I mean, it is, people think it's truly gonna be really bad, which means it might not be bad.  It's very interesting.  When people really prepare and over-prepare, it might mean that actually it's not gonna be that bad or it's gonna be horrible.  Yeah, downtown is looking kind of weird, though.  Most of the businesses are boarding up.  Yeah, they're boarding up all the businesses downtown.  Yeah.  Lovely.  Seems fun.  Yeah, and the National Guard's around the capital.  The National Guard's in the capital.  Yeah, that's correct.  Yeah.  What a day.  Yep.  What a day.  What a year.  What a year is right... How do you think, what do you think COVID did to comedy?  We planned this out.  It's fucking terrible.  It's the worst thing to happen for comedy ever.  It hit the brakes on stand-up comedy for fucking eight months.  Yeah.  It's awful.  I think the good news is there's a lot of people that really shouldn't have been in comedy that are going to quit.  Yes.  And the bad news is it's really hard to see comedy if you're a fan.  And for comics to perform, it's really difficult.  For comics that didn't have a podcast, it was a real wake-up call.  They're fucked.  They're fucked.  That was... That's one of the more interesting things that comics realize like, oh, I can't count on Hollywood to pay my bills because all Hollywood production shut down too.  And it sort of \u2013 it highlighted the value of being an independent podcaster or a YouTuber or just having your own content that you put out where people can just see you without any bullshit.  You don't have to have an executive telling you what to do or someone hiring you.  You just do it.  You just put it out.  What I have it at now is like \u2013 At 256.  There it is.  There's the podcast studio.  This is it, folks.  This is my room.  We had a podcast studio in my room here.  And that's why I scream and yell.  I scream and yell at this bed.  All right.  I'll leave you guys alone.  Thank you.  Thank you, Dan.  Bye, everybody.  Bye, guys.  Thank you. ",
