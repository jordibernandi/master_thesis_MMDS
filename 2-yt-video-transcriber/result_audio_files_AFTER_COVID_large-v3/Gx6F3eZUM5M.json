But that's no reason not to do one of our classic deep fat fried debates.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It's all you got to do to watch us react to the Bernie Sanders versus Joe Biden 1v1 debate.

Because YouTube and the news media have decided that it's not in the public interest to be able to discuss the debate.  But we're not going to let them stop us.  No, sir, no way, no how.
