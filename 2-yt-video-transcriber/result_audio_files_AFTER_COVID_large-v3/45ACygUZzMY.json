            "text": "She went on to explain how she didn't tell me because she didn't want a drunken slip-up to destroy our life.  Wow.  What's going on everybody?  Hope everybody's feeling good.  Hope everybody's doing well.  We are back with another story.  Guys, I will put the link to this in the description like usual.  You guys read the title.  Let's get straight into it.  So, my wife cheated during her bachelorette party.  I'm heartbroken and confused.  Man.  Me and my wife have been together six years, married for about two years.  Oh.  Last night, one of her close friends who she had fallen out with recently told me how my wife got really drunk during her party and ended up sleeping with some guy.  Wow.  Initially, I didn't believe her because their relationship isn't the best, but then she had another woman who was there to confirm the story.  Dang.  Dang.  I had planned to wait a couple days to gather my thoughts before confronting my wife, but I couldn't.  When she got home from work, I confronted her about it.  At first, she denied, but as I continued to press, she admitted it.  She started crying and saying how it was a drunken mistake and how she'd never do that sob or blah blah blah.  I left.  I spent the rest of the night and most of today trying to figure out what I'm going to do.  I had my life planned out with this woman, and she betrayed me.  I haven't spoken to her today, though she's been flooding my phone with a million calls and text messages.  Any advice?  Sorry for any spelling mistakes.  Let me just go ahead and check out the comments here, but he has an update.  So we'll go to the update, but let's look at these comments here.  Someone said, the most compelling thing is the amount of time she hid this.  I know, right?  That's why he said they were married or together six years, married for two.  So hold on, did she cheat at her bachelorette party or her friend's bachelorette party?  Anyway, he says, honestly, that's what's scaring me the most.  Two years she hid this from me.  I don't know if that trust can ever be rebuilt.  I'm just so blindsided, like what else could she be lying about?  Was it really a one time thing?  My mind is in all of those insecure and dark places.  Someone said, if you have no kids, I highly recommend divorce.  You haven't been married long and she is already cheating and blaming alcohol.  You also seem young, maybe late 20s, early 30s.  Don't waste time trying to reconcile bullish.  and finding out.  you wasted two and a half more years to end up at the same finish line.  You can also add her friends clearly not being friends of marriage to list of cons.  Someone else said, once trust is broken like that, it's hard to get back on.  Absolutely.  Once trust is gone, it's a wrap.  You will never trust somebody.  If somebody breaks your trust, I don't care if it's just your homie, whether it's in a relationship, if it's a family member, your cousin, best friend.  Once somebody breaks your trust, it's so hard to get that.  I don't even know how you can get it back.  Break my trust, it's over.  I'll just never trust you again.  Never.  Never.  Someone said, get a lawyer and divorce.  There's no working through this when she's been lying to you for two years.  If her friends didn't tell you, you'd probably have never found out.  And she would have continued cheating.  Someone said, sounds like she's really good at lying and hiding her cheating from you.  Think about that.  Yep.  Someone said she probably would have taken this ish to the grave with her if those other women didn't speak up.  So chances are there's no way to trust her again.  Don't even think about anything else she could be hiding or lying about because she won't be forthcoming about anything unless presented with evidence, as she's shown.  Focus on where to go from here and protect yourself.  Someone else said, pal, you need to file for divorce.  She'll cheat again.  You'll find a better woman one day, but you need to get out.  Someone else said, honestly, if she was able to cheat on you and keep it a secret for that long, you really don't know what else she could be lying about.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Let's check out the update.  He has an update.  So update.  Update on.  my wife cheated during her bachelorette party.  I'm heartbroken and confused.  We FaceTimed for about an hour.  She cried a lot and explained that it was a one time thing and how I should come home so we can discuss us.  I rejected her offer and said I need her to leave the house for a while while I collect my thoughts and figure out what I wanted to do next.  She agreed.  Not like she had a choice.  The home was given to me when my father passed.  I was asking why she did this and why did she hide it from me.  She breaks down again explaining that it was a stupid mistake that she felt pressure to make and she's never spoken to the guy since.  She offered me all her social media passwords and begged me not to leave her and try and work through this.  I didn't respond and she went on to explain how she didn't tell me because she didn't want a drunken slip up to destroy our life.  Wow.  After some more awkward silence, she tells me I can sleep with anyone, anyone I wanted, any woman.  And I shut that down and I just said, I need space.  She's leaving the house tonight and I'm meeting with my brother in a couple hours to explain the situation to him.  I'm still not sure what I want to do, but I understand that this isn't a decision I should rush.  I'm meeting with my lawyer tomorrow and plan on taking half the money from our joint accounts just to be safe.  Yep, better hurry up before she cleans it out.  Let's check out the comments on this one.  Someone said, she had sex with someone during her bachelorette party and then could look you in your face and say her vows, et cetera, while knowing what she did.  Damn, dude, it was always bad, but when you put it that way, that was the last effing nail in the coffin.  Someone else said, putting it that way, sheesh, you need to run.  Trust will never come back once someone's cheated.  No ish, that's the most effed up part of this whole thing.  How on earth could she go through with that?  Right, yeah, she literally had someone in her the night before.  The next morning, crying in your face how she will obey you, she'll never betray you, blah, blah, blah, till death.  do us part.  Oh, man.  Someone said, but once that trust is broken, there isn't much you can do, in my opinion.  And someone says, there is, but it takes a long time.  Ain't nobody got time for that.  It happened to my parents, actually.  Dad cheated on my mom during their honeymoon.  Damn.  He was a scumbag when drunk.  Mom found out like two years later, and they have been in marriage counseling since.  It took about a year from them to be able to sleep in the same bed together, and now after five years, they are back to how they were.  They wouldn't have managed without us kids, though.  They initially didn't split because they wanted to keep a healthy family.  They handled it well, in my opinion.  On the upside, my dad has been sober for a bit of five years now, so that's something positive from this whole ordeal.  Wow.  Someone else said, the worst thing about this is, depending on how soon after the party they got married, she might have walked to the altar with the other guy's sperm still sloshing around inside of her.  That stuff can survive for two to five days and stay around dead for a bit longer.  Personally, I couldn't get over this.  No.  And I do know sometimes people have bachelor and bachelorette parties two weeks before whatever.  Dude, the fact that she did that and still married you is messed up.  That's messed up.  This only suggests that she only feels bad about being caught and facing consequences.  Absolutely.  That's always the case.  She was never going to say anything.  Not a word.  Until she ticked her friend off and she was like, oh yeah, okay.  I'm gonna tell your husband what you did.  It happens to far too many guys.  Women at bachelorette parties are awful.  They try to pressure the bride-to-be to get into so much questionable behavior.  It's like they stopped seeing the fiance as a person for a night.  That's what would do it for me too.  That cheating is really terrible, but people make grievous mistakes all the time.  To pretend that there are no situations in which you would do the same is just prideful.  I might even be able to forgive someone for cheating on me, but literally the next day she said her wedding vows.  That takes lying to a whole new level.  You can't come back from that.  Someone else said, a drunken, spontaneous fling right before getting married?  What's worse is she may have had another guy spunk in her while she said those vows, depending on how careless she may have been.  Well, she said she was so drunk, she couldn't help herself.  I'm pretty sure if that guy wanted to raw dog, he did.  I'm pretty sure.  And let's be honest, do women really make guys put one on?  Nope.  Nope. ",
