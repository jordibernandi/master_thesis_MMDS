            "text": "Let America be America again.  Let it be the dream it used to be.  Let it be the pioneer on the plane seeking a home where he himself is free.  America never was America to me.  let america be the dream the dreamers dreamed.  let it be that great strong land of love where never kings connive nor tyrants scheme that any man be crushed by one above.  it never was america to me.  oh let my land be a land where liberty is crowned with no false patriotic wreath.  but opportunity is real and life is free.  equality is in the air we breathe Say, who are you that mumbles in the dark, And who are you that draws your veil across the stars?  I am the poor white, fooled and pushed apart, I am the negro bearing slavery's scars, I am the red man driven from the land, I am the immigrant clutching the hope I seek, And finding only the same old stupid plan Of dog-eat-dog, of mighty crush the weak.  Oh, let America be America again, the land that never has been yet, and yet must be the land where every man is free.  Sure, call me any ugly name you choose.  The steel of freedom does not stain.  From those who live like leeches on people's lives, we must take back our land again.  America!  Oh yes, I say it plain.  America never was America to me.  And yet I swear this oath.  America will be America. ",
