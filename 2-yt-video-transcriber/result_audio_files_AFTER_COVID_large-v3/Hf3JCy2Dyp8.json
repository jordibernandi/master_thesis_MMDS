And for the most part, there were not a whole lot going on.  It was a peaceful protest.  I would estimate there was maybe over 500.  It was attended by people of all walks of life.  even with families with children of all ages.  I did speak to police command, and they said that, except for a few incidents, it was pretty much a peaceful protest.  I'm here with Captain Almquist.  He's the incident commander here at this protest.  Captain, what are your thoughts and your comments about this protest?  Looks pretty peaceful so far. ",

We need to vote someone into office who will look at people, at their citizens, crying out for help and do something about it.  Power to the people!  Power to the freaking people!
