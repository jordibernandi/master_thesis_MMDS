            "text": "We are inside Zambiza forest fighting Boko Haram terrorists in order to bring peace to our country, our fatherland.  We are here inside Zambiza forest doing jihad.  We Nigerian soldiers, we are doing jihad.  But Boko Haram, they are terrorizing people, they are not doing jihad.  Boko Haram, they decide to hide themselves under the umbrella of Islam to be establishing mischief, to be killing people in order to give the religion black paint as they give now, as you can see now, in order to give the religion black paint to stand the religion.  But the activities of Boko Haram did not centralize to the teaching of Islam.  In the Holy Quran, God Almighty ordered the prophet of Islam to perform, to establish jihad.  But the question is how the prophet of Islam establishes his own jihad.  In Surah Al-Furqan, Allah says, What is the meaning of Jihad al-Kabirah?  If you want to know the meaning of Jihad al-Kabirah, you go to Surah Al-Ahzab.  Allah says, Womubashiran, as a giver of the good news.  Wanaziran, as a court-warner.  Wadaiyan illa Allahi bi-izzinillah, as the one who is calling people, who is preaching and inviting people to the region of Allah.  Wasiraja Mubira, you are like a lamp separating light to the whole congregation.  This we show you that jihad of God Almighty is when God Almighty is preaching.  Preach by preaching as Islam established.  Preach, invite people by preaching.  Not by killing people.  The same thing in Surah Al-Ma'idah, Allah says, I send you no problem, but as a message to the whole congregation of mankind.  In Surah Al-A'raf, Allah says, I am a messenger of Allah to the whole congregation of mankind.  In Surah Al-Hajj, I am a messenger as a giver of good news, as also a court warner.  So you see, all these verses I tell you, God Almighty sent Prophet Muhammad to establish, I mean, to preach, not to be killing people.  And this is the duty, even before Prophet Muhammad, all the prophets that God Almighty sent, from Adam, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, Elijah, Elisha, Zechariah, John the Baptist, Job, Jonah, Nehemiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, John, Micah, Abba, David, Solomon, Isaiah, and lastly, Jesus Christ, all of the God Almighty, command them to preach not to kill people.  We have sent to each and every generation, every umma, every community, Allah said we have sent a guide, the central core of the message is to believe in only one true God, to preach and invite people to the religion of Allah.  The same thing Allah said, there is no any generation of mankind, Allah said, but a warner, we send a warner, What is the duty of the owner?  to preach and invite people to the region of Allah?  The same thing in Surah Al-Anbiya, Allah said, Allah said, Prophet Muhammad, all the messenger that come, I did not give you anything, nothing new said to you.  I said, what?  has been told the prophet before you what Allah tells them?  to preach and invite people to the religion of Allah.  So jihad in Islam means to preach, not to be killing people.  But if you didn't have knowledge to preach, so you can carry people away.  Because this one, even if you are ignorant, you can fight.  But if you are ignorant, you cannot preach.  Because God said, \u064a\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0641\u064e\u0639\u0650 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0647\u064f \u0627\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0630\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064e \u0622\u0645\u064e\u0646\u064f\u0648\u0627 \u0645\u0650\u0646\u0652\u0643\u064f\u0645\u0652 \u0648\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0630\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064e \u0623\u064f\u0648\u062a\u064f\u0648\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0625\u0650\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0629\u0650 \u062f\u064e\u0631\u064e\u062c\u064e\u0627\u062a\u064d.  Prophet of Islam said in one hadith, You see, all divine is talking about knowledge.  Why?  But God Almighty did not tell Prophet Muhammad to kill anybody.  And from Koba to Koba, there is not any bus that God Almighty commands Muslims to kill Muslims.  Nowhere.  Even the bus that Boko Haram are using to be killing people.  in Surah Al-Baqarah, Quran chapter 2, verse 190.  Allah says, \u0648\u064e\u0642\u064e\u0627\u062a\u0650\u0644\u064f\u0648\u0627 \u0641\u0650\u064a \u0633\u064e\u0628\u0650\u064a\u0644\u0650 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0647\u0650 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0647\u0650 \u0632\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064e \u064a\u064f\u0642\u064e\u0627\u062a\u0650\u0644\u064f\u0648\u0646\u064e\u0643\u064f\u0645\u0652 \u0648\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0627 \u062a\u064e\u0639\u0652\u062f\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0627.  in that last night he put what i think unless you look at it.  if he said he liked it everybody ending will allow anybody to anybody in the world.  what is the report this month?  the question is which people would like to come up with a moment to keep?  yes you could want him to keep but which people?  and that's it.  and as you know you've got to look at those which you just want to use.  that was unless you want to go Don't do those that do not kill your people, your disciples.  Allah do not like those who are gracious.  Meaning, if you kill those that do not kill your people, meaning you are good, what do you mean gracious?  What happened is that Whosoever that read Sira or any Tafsir or Hadith, you know what happened?  The disciples of Prophet Muhammad, they were defeated in the battle of Hud.  They were defeated.  Many of them, they run from that battle.  They were defeated by the Mushroom of Makkah.  So Mushroom of Makkah, they killed many disciples of Prophet Muhammad.  So that is the reason why in Surah Al-Imran, Quran chapter 3, verse 169, Allah says, Allah says, I give them prohibition.  by the way that you perceive not.  So just one who I kill in that battle of hood, God Almighty revealed that bus to Prophet Muhammad and said, Kill just one.  The bus is not talking about just generally we Muslims we just start to be killing people.  No.  God Almighty revealed to Prophet Muhammad to take revenge.  Those who kill his disciples, God Almighty ordered Prophet Muhammad to kill them to take revenge on them.  But you Abu Bakr al-Sheikh and other leaders, you are using this bus against Nigerian people.  But if you say that that bus is talking about to be killing people, how are you going to disperse that?  God Almighty said, Allah said, as far as you are a Muslim, there is no way in any way, in no reason, as a Muslim you can kill your fellow Muslim.  Allah said, except by mistake.  Even if you kill a Muslim by mistake, Allah said, for dear to Muslim, you must pay dear.  By mistake, not intentionally, but you pay dear.  How much is dear?  Almost 46,600,000 and something.  That is by mistake, not intentionally.  But if you kill a Muslim intentionally, what will happen to you?  If he enters, what will happen to him?  Allah will prepare for him a disgraceful punishment.  Abdullah Ibn Abbas, he knows Quran more than any surface of Prophet Muhammad.  If you check Tafsir of Jami'ul Bayan or Faktul Kabir, or even any Tafsir under this verse, he says, Even if he repents and seeks forgiveness, God Almighty will not forgive him.  Because God Almighty says, He goes to the fire.  And in Surah Ali Imran, Quran chapter 11, Allah said, He will not break his promise.  As God Almighty said, if you kill a Muslim intentionally, you go to a hellfire.  If you kill, you must go to that hellfire.  Boko Haram, are you killing Muslims or not?  You are killing Muslims intentionally.  How are you going to do that?  And secondly, what about Muslims?  As you are killing non-Muslims, go to Surah Al-Ma'idah.  In Surah Al-Ma'idah, we have ordained to teach them.  We have ordained to teach them.  If you kill him, Allah will say you to you.  Penalty, you'll be killed.  If you remove some one eye, your eye will be blocked out too.  If you cut somebody's ear, your ear will be blocked too.  You see, according to this verse, anything you did to your fellow human beings, the same punishment shall apply to you.  If you go back to Surah Al-Ma'idah, Quran chapter 5 verse 3, Allah says, without any justification, without any relation of murder, or if you establish mischief on earth as work or haram, are establishing mischief, killing people, slaughtering people without any justification, Allah says the gravity of such person is like he killed the whole congregation of mankind.  Allah said, if you save one person from death, neither that particular person was a Muslim or not, Allah said, Allah said, the good reward of that person is like he saved the whole congregation of mankind from death.  How are you going to do with these verses if you are in right guidance?  Are you telling me there is contradiction in the Holy Quran?  When Allah says, All these verses are telling us there is no contradiction in the Holy Quran.  So these verses that say you should not kill, that killing that you are killing, if you are right, which means there is contradiction in the Holy Quran.  So now there is two things.  Neither Quran is lying, Boko Haram are right.  Or Boko Haram are lying, Quran is right.  One will say, you Boko Haram, I want you to choose.  Neither you are right, Quran is lying.  Or Quran is right, you are lying.  Who is lying?  Who is lying?  That work will unseat.  You should not kill.  And you, you are clean.  And you say you are fulfillment of religion.  What is happening?  Boko Haram, they were already programmed to believe in false figures.  They were deceived and misled by their leaders.  That is the reason why in the Day of Judgment, in Surah Al-Azhar, Allah says, In the Day of Judgment, if God Almighty bends some people in the Khilafah, If we say we know, we follow God Almighty, we follow the teaching of Prophet Muhammad, we do not kill people, we stay peacefully in Nigeria with people, God Almighty will more punish you and burn us in hellfire like this.  They will say, Rabbana, Rabbana, these are our people, these are our leaders, these are our big men.  They are the ones who mislead us and tell us, what we are doing is Jahannam, we die, we find awful things to what we have been told in the Lord.  Rabbana, defend me from the punishment.  This one, these people who deceive us, double their punishment.  Mighty, great, of course.  This will happen because why?  You people, you are mislead.  In Surah Al-Baqarah, Quran chapter 2, verse 163, Allah said, In the day of judgment, When Abu Bakr shake out, they will send down who they were misleads in the world.  Both of them will happen.  Argument will take place between them.  Why?  Because they have already misled them.  Both of them are going to the hellfire.  If you allow anybody to mislead you and him and that particular person, God Almighty will bring all of you to the hellfire.  Why?  Because Boko Haram, you people are ignorant.  You refuse to seek knowledge of the religion.  That way you easily mislead.  You are told that if you go to paradise, you go to heaven, God Almighty will give you a woman, Beijing.  Who will give you?  You decrease.  You kill people.  God Almighty will just carry Beijing.  Because they say, God Almighty said, You see that?  So all these things will happen between this one and the other.  What do I say in Surah Al-A'raf, Quran chapter 7, verse 179.  Allah says, Allah says, Allah says, Allah said, Because those countries have already sealed their heart.  They did not allow their heart to receive the admonition of God Almighty.  If their heart is not sealed, you cannot line human beings and slaughter him.  Even I myself, As a soldier, I never and I will never slaughter a human being.  But you will call it, you must call it for me.  Many have called it, but I will not slaughter.  But Boko Haram are slaughtering human beings.  This will show you that God Almighty has already sealed their head.  They have no human being's sympathy.  Allah says, God Almighty has sealed the head of some people.  Allah said, if God Almighty still there of some people, no matter who you preach to them, they will never return to the right path.  Diwali scholars, many scholars preach to Boko Haram, but they kill the scholars.  They kill Albanians and other scholars because they preach to the wife because they will not come back to the right path.  Like, that's it.  Like, what is that?  What is that? ",
