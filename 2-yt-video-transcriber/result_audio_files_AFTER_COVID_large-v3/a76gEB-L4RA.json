It's clearly a flu with a bigger kick than a normal flu.  I'm not arguing that.  But I am stating that Chris Cuomo came out fine.  And if you remember, his brother was on the news from one of the blue states, New York, arguing against Trump, picking these little back-and-forth soap opera-ish fights.  He was doing that.  The brother was doing that.  But nonetheless, I felt bad.  Even my family was praying for both of these guys because... Even though they're both on the far left, and Chris is as far left as you can possibly come.  I had a chance, I had in my heart, I thought, you know, we're gonna really, we're gonna pray for this guy.  We're gonna, because I felt bad, and they were doing like this soap opera TV show stuff.
