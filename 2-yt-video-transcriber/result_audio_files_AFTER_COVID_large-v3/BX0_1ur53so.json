And do not pick from the extreme left or the extreme right.  Take from things like The Independent and NPR and NBC.  Yes, these places are 100% proven for 50, 60, 70 decades that they have been unbiased.  Talking about independent news. ",

            "text": "I cannot understand the logic of you saying this president loves our veterans when all he does, when all he... Their pay has not increased like he promised.  Their benefits have not increased like he promised.  The budget has been decreased against what he promised.  So how factually can he say he supports and loves our veterans, miss?  After the fact that he told them that they were suckers and losers for dying in war.  I'm not trying to be ignorant.  Let me bump, let me piss.  I'm going to respectfully ask you not.  Okay, fine.  I'm going to look into this, okay?  I will look into the VA policy.  Positive conversation.  This is what we're saying.  You cannot be going around.  But I can.  But I can because I know how much he loves... I've let you speak.  I've let you speak.  I know how much he loves our servicemen and women.  How?  Because he's brought them home.  He's ended the lifelong wars.  He has nothing.  He has nothing.  They have nothing here.  We've been in endless wars, endless wars, with neocons that want us to go to war.  All those military generals that don't support Trump.  Miss, what war did he end?  We didn't go to war.  We were supposed to go to war with North Korea.  No.  You just said that we've been in wars.  Miss, what war did he end?  Okay, that he didn't end wars, but we're not participating.  Yes, we are.  Miss, we are dropping bombs at an exponential rate all across the Middle East.  This year alone, we have dropped the most drone strikes on Iran, on Afghanistan, on Pakistan, on Syria.  You name it, Syria.  We are using drone warfare.  That is how military conquest has evolved.  That's how World War III almost started in January because he killed... So when he says I'm bringing our troops home, sure, I will give you that it is technically right.  It is not ending war, though, and it is increasing military budgets.  Decades and decades and decades of wars in the Middle East.  This president signed peace treaties today.  With Iran and the UAE, Israel has been effectively at peace for over a decade.  All they did was formalize it.  That's it.  That peace is existing.  He made it seem bigger than it is.  And he still did not include Palestine at the negotiation table.  So that is problematic.  That is... You're sharing this with me.  But this year does nothing productive.  It does nothing productive.  It does nothing productive.  I would like to have a conversation.  I don't hate you.  I don't hate you.  I love you.  I look at people's eyes.  I see people who hate me.  You voted for a president that hates me.  No.  Sure.  But you say you love people, then you should.  I feel anger.  I feel all of it.  We are angry.  We are angry.  You know why we're angry?  Because Trump is actively promoting our deaths.  He is promoting the deaths of Black Lives Matter.  He is promoting.  He literally called the people, the Kenosha shooter, the person that came into a Black Lives Matter.  Who defended himself from a guy that was banned on TV.  He had his mother.  He had his mother.  Miss, miss, miss.  He worked that day.  Miss, respectfully, the autopsy shows that that man was shot in the back seven times.  There is no way he was defending.  He drove two state lines to be there.  And he also broke five felonies.  He worked there that day.  No, no.  He broke five felonies.  He broke five felonies.  I want to go join.  Listen, listen.  And he's so guilty.  Sure, that's fine.  But he broke five felonies to do that, which makes self-defense inadmissible as a defense.  gun to his head and he was about to get bashed to end with a skateboard and he fired and defended himself like that.  no no that man that used the skateboard to attack kyle rittenhouse.  yes yeah yes do you know what happened?  but do you know what happened right before that man hit him with a skateboard killed that he shot in the head.  do you know that he raped children?  do you know that he was a sex offender that raped children?  you can look up his record.  two things miss two things.  miss two things.  perfect two things.  He was being attacked. ",
