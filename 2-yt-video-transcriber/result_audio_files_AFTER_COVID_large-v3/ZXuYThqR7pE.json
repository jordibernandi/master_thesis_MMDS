This is gaining a lot of steam.  Nancy Pelosi this morning just refused to answer if she would support defunding the police.  I just want to know from you, do you support defunding and removing police from American communities?

            "text": "So, Megan, I think that a big part of this conversation really is about reimagining how we do public safety in America, which I support, which is this.  We have confused the idea that to achieve safety, you put more cops on the street.  Instead of understanding.  to achieve safe and healthy communities, you put more resources into the public education system of those communities, into affordable housing, into home ownership, into access to capital for small businesses.  access to health care regardless of how much money people have.  That's how you achieve safe and healthy communities.  And so we really do need to understand and reimagine what and how we can actually make and help make communities safe.  Because here's the bottom line.  If you contrast many communities which have a heavy presence of police to middle and upper middle class suburbs in America, You will not see that presence of police.  But what you will see, you will see families who have an income that allows them to get through the end of the month.  You will see good public schools.  You will see people who have access to health care and can afford it.  You will see people who have jobs.  And so this has to be the conversation, which is how are we going to be smart in achieving what should be our collective goal, which is that all communities are safe and knowing that safe communities are usually safe because they are healthy, healthy because of a number of things, including the economy, including education, including access to health care.  And that's how I think about this.  You know, in many cities in America, over one third of their city budget goes to police.  So we have to have this conversation.  What are we doing?  What about the money going to social services?  What about the money going to helping people with job training?  What about helping with the mental health issues that communities are being plagued with for which we're putting no resources?  And here's the other thing.  When I talk to law enforcement, they know that they don't want to be, nor are they skilled, to be the ones who are responding to someone with mental illness or substance abuse or the homeless population.  But in many cities, that's what's happening because we are not directing those resources, those public resources, to where they need to go, which is addressing mental health, homelessness, substance abuse, so that we don't have to have a police response because we are smarter.

You know, we have great ideas and I don't think anyone with two grains of sense would disagree with anything that Senator Harris just said there.  Even Meghan McCain seemed to agree with what she was saying.  The challenge is that the actual phrase that's being used to describe that can lead people to misinterpret what's being demanded here.  When I hear the word defund, the original thought that comes to mind is to zero out of budget, right?  That means that's what most people will believe.  So it requires a lot of explanation and a lot of education to get people to the point where they really understand the broader arguments around it.  Here's the challenge with politics.  When you're explaining, you're losing, period.  But the deal, though, but Brittany, it seems like to me, if you're going to if you're if your argument is that you want to redirect funding and you have to go into greater detail, that's fine.  To me, a better argument or a better thing to focus in on would say would be to say demilitarize the police.  And then I think more people can get that and understand that.

You can explain defund the police means this.  That's why Senator Kamala Harris, Brittany said, how do you define it, Megan?  She explained it, but then Megan didn't want to hear the definition because Megan had in her own mind what it is.

I've seen people who believe that defunding the police means that we will still have police in the way that we think about it today.  They will literally just have less funding.  We will divest from policing and we will invest in communities of color, as Kamala Harris just stated.  But I've also seen people pushing for something different, which is to get rid of policing as we know it.  And I think that they use such examples as what's going on in Minneapolis.  You know, we think about the University of Minneapolis contracts with, you know, they cancel their contracts with police.  We see them being pulled out of the local school systems there.  You know, we hear council members talking about completely revisioning what we know and understand policing to be in its current state.

We haven't studied the same things.  So I think everybody in the panel, to your point, Roland, which is like, come on, bro.  Like, you can't be talking about something that you, you know, don't even, can't even pretty much explain.  At the same time, when you're, first at this point, you have to be able to explain this in a manner.  You got to applesauce it.  you babies don't have teeth.  you have to be able to give it to them in applesauce chunks.  if these are the people that you're trying to explain because like britney said there's different packaging it's no different than the riots you know there are.  there are people that are there that are actively trying to peaceably protest that see something that's wrong.  they're trying to solve the problem with civil disobedience or unrest whatever you want to call it.  then there's instigators and then there's the guys that just want lebron james sneakers that just want to wait later.  But the general public, when it's shown on television, they may have, unless it's explained and broken down, right, they may have that one view of a thing one way, and it can be incomplete.  When a lot of these issues, I think we try to make them very simple, but again, it's a holistic process.  In certain areas, we do need more reform.  There are certain areas where they have to handle people the same way.  There's other areas where 70% of that needs to get trashed.  You can look at an Ahmaud Arbery situation.  That whole DA, that whole situation is horrible.  But you may not have the same scenario there.  I think that's an example of how you can explain that to people at different levels.  And I think that, you know, Senator Harris asked her, well, what is your definition of defunding?  So I can see where I'm actually needing to act.  Even though I did just explain this to you, Very thoroughly.  I can kind of meet you somewhere in the middle. ",
