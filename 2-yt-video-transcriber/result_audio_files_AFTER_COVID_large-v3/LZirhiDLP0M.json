And he even cited an example of a 1997 Miami mayor election that resulted in 36 arrests for absentee ballot fraud.  That election had to be rerun and the results were reversed.  That is an example from 1997.  But there are many others like Patterson, New Jersey, where four men were charged with voting fraud recently.  Four more men were charged in California.
