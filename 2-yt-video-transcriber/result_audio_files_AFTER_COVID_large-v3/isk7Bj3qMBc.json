            "text": "Each one of these pixels is $1,000.  Now for most people, that is a substantial amount of money.  This is 50,000 visualized.  That's life-changing for folks like you and I. Next to that life-changing rectangle is a million visualized.  This is 10 million.  All right, this is the one you've been waiting for.  Here is a whopping billion visualized.  That is a lot of money.  And folks like Gates and Bezos have 100 plus of these.  I can't even fit that on the screen.  We call people who own a billion or more billionaires.  There's a lot of discourse swirling around the topic of billionaires and whether or not this kind of wealth in private hands should exist.  This debate has thus far been drowned by liberal voices, both conservatives and progressives.  Here we're going to lay out the socialist case against billionaires.  Before laying out the socialist case, it's important we come to understand the conservative arguments used to justify billionaires.  These arguments and justifications all make appeals to the good billionaire.  This idea that sure there may be bad billionaires who may do bad things, but there are many good billionaires, who are self-made, who donate their wealth to charities, who create jobs, innovate, create great things for society, and so on.  These are good billionaires who use their wealth for good.  Why should we demonize these actors and take away their wealth?  It's not particularly hard to expose these points as lacking, and liberal progressives do a decent job of highlighting this.  Let's quickly run through them.  The title of self-made billionaire is often misleading.  When you have wealth to begin with, it's not terribly hard to turn out more wealth.  To turn a hundred million into a billion.  Kylie Jenner is an apt example of this.  In addition to the lucrative tax deductibles and exemptions associated with charitable donations so billionaires don't have to pay their fair share, these charitable donations allow billionaires to directly control how their donations are used.  pursuing niche pet projects, slapping their names on buildings, buying portraits of themselves, all while avoiding any structural changes which might jeopardize the very economic system which has benefited them and continues to do so.  Job creation doesn't mean much when the jobs you are creating are more precarious, lower paying and more taxing, forcing workers to juggle multiple jobs just to stay afloat.  And it's not that these billionaires innovate, so much as these are the actors who most successfully find ways to monetize innovations, most often monetizing innovations from the public sector and happily accepting the public image of an innovator.  Now, as solid as these counter-arguments may be, progressives genuinely struggle to argue against the perfect billionaire.  an actual rags to riches billionaire.  a billionaire who not only pays their fair share of taxes but advocates on paying more.  a billionaire who earnestly donates their wealth with no ulterior motives or gains.  and here is the fundamental issue.  with liberal progressive arguments advocating the abolition of billionaires They all rest on the idea that every single billionaire has committed some morally reprehensible act in their record or has the power to.  Interference with democracy, abuses of workers, tax dodging, and so on.  The existence of just one perfect billionaire entirely kneecaps this progressive argument.  Even just the possibility that there can feasibly exist this perfect billionaire who uses their power for good seriously undermines the argument.  And what ends up happening is that progressives are burdened with finding dirt in the records of every single billionaire.  Otherwise, if they can't do that, the existence of billionaires is okay, and the real issue is just getting bad billionaires to behave.  The socialist argument is straightforward.  This wealth was never theirs to begin with.  The wealth of these billionaires was generated by the workers.  You know what, Mr.  Bloomberg, it wasn't you who made all that money.  Maybe your workers played some role in that as well.  No one individual single-handedly does a billion dollars worth of labor.  Bill Gates is not the one generating a million dollars worth of work while he takes a mid-afternoon nap.  it's generated by those actually sowing and mining by those assembling the products and transporting the products by those on the ground doing the work on subsistence wages.  i've thoroughly described this relationship of exploitation between the property owner and the worker in my previous videos But the basic idea is that these workers are generating more value than they're being paid, and it's the surplus value generated which is the origin of profit for the property owner.  If the property owner paid their workers exactly the value they generated, there'd be no reason to hire the worker in the first place.  This relationship of exploitation is the basis upon which capitalism exists.  Without this point of exploitation, there is no profit, there is no billionaire class, and there is no perfect billionaire.  What's the solution?  Progressives propose taxation as the primary answer in addressing wealth inequality and dissolving the billionaire status.  Not only is taxation an increasingly harder feat to accomplish, thanks to our globalized economy in which evading national taxes has never been so easy, but even if these taxation efforts manage to eliminate billionaires, the problems associated with billionaires would still remain.  The power of billionaires to abuse workers, to corrupt our political systems, to stand above the law.  All these powers don't lie in the amount of money these billionaires have, but rather lies in the fact that they are property owners.  Unelected, unaccountable individuals who get to privately dictate all economic decisions.  And folks like Zuckerberg are acutely aware that their power lies in their private ownership, and it's why they're more than willing to have taxes raised.  Oh, congratulations!  Bezos is no longer a billionaire, but a millionaire.  But because he still privately owns Amazon, he can still do very cool things like bend elected politicians to his will by promising to bring jobs to their city or state if they pass certain laws and repeal certain others.  Billionaires are a symptom, and you're not going to cure a disease by treating symptoms.  Private property's gotta be abolished.  And I'm not talking about your toothbrushes, calm down.  I'm talking about the means of production.  The stuff that produces stuff.  Stuff, which I might add, everyone needs or else they die.  Seriously, ask yourself, why do we just let private, unelected, unaccountable individuals claim private ownership over these things and let them just passively live off of our collective labor?  The means of production must be freed from the private dictation of individuals and put under the democratic control of the working people.  As opposed to having the wealth generated by the workers pocketed by private racketeers so they can buy their third yacht or whatever, workers under a democratic economy can be paid proportionately to the labor they contribute.  The harder you work, the more you're paid.  If you want to lead a lavish lifestyle, you've got to work for it, bud.  Workers can then debate and hold votes to decide how the remaining surplus in wealth should be used.  Whether they want to invest more into developing this or that sector of the economy, to properly fund robust public research and innovation, to further develop labor-saving technology, to improve healthcare services, to tackle public emergencies, and so on.  You know... The most rational thing to do in a civilized society, as opposed to having the public completely at the mercy of private individuals and their feelings of generosity that day?  I just want to make a quick point now that we have a lot of these cases and solutions laid out.  We can understand why billionaires and their priests peddle pro-billionaire arguments, but why do so many working class individuals make these same arguments?  The working classes have an intuitive understanding that, all around them, freedom doesn't exist unless you're rich.  It's only the wealthy who have the freedom to exercise their humanity under capitalism, to spend time with their family and friends, to pursue and develop personal hobbies, travel and actually experience the world, all without putting their existence in jeopardy.  The freedom to exist as a human being becomes synonymous with being rich under capitalism.  So when naive progressives come along, talking about the immorality of being a billionaire, and by proxy, the immorality of being rich, progressives are unwittingly attacking a freedom many desperately yearn for.  And with their plan to tax away wealth, they're telling the worker if they ever do get this freedom, they're going to snatch it away and condemn them back to a life on the treadmill.  So you can understand why many workers are so quick to defend the rich, to defend billionaires, picking up whatever argument they can in an attempt to defend the freedom they one day hope to have.  Contrast this to the socialist argument and solution.  The socialist is not attacking wealth in and of itself.  The socialist is pointing out that those who are wealthy did it off of your labor and that our economy ought to earnestly adhere to the principle that those who work more should be paid more.
