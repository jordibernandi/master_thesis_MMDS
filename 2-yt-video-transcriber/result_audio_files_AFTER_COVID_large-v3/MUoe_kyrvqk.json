You said he was the Messiah.  You said he was invincible.  You said it was all over.  They were all going to get Moe.  Now, oh, he's part of a larger thing of Q. I will not suffer your Q people after this.  I knew what you were day one, and I know what you are now, and I'm sick of it.  I'm sick of all these witches and warlocks and pumpkin popsums and everything else.  Sorry.  Bye-bye, Q. I can't talk to you anymore.  Jesus Christ.  Lord, help me. ",

            "text": "QAnon lost Alex Jones.  He apparently previously had gone back, forth, back, forth a few times, giving them some credit, but then backed off of it, and giving them some credit, then backed off of it, but now, obviously, he's done with them.  This is fascinating.  Now, why is he doing it?  I mean, there's a few theories.  It could just be because they're competition.  You know, like Alex Jones is the conspiracy guy.  He's the place you go to for conspiracy stuff.  He views them as a threat to that, as a threat to his, like, lockdown on that market.  That's possible.  It's also possible.  he's trying to protect his butt legally because he was at the rally that was just before the Capitol Hill riot.  And, you know, he was giving a speech and saying things that are probably super questionable.  So he might be looking out to protect himself legally.  But, you know, another interpretation of it is exactly what you see here, which is just like he actually is fed up with them and doesn't agree with them.  And, you know, they have.  I mean, he's actually correct that they've.  said certain things.  almost everything they say just factually turns out to be verifiably provably wrong like they're just wrong.  they say certain things are going to happen.  those things don't happen you know and he probably is tired of that.  but the funny thing is that's exactly what Alex Jones does like.  he always says things that turn out to not become true.  always I mean he's predicting a Donald Trump landslide victory You know, so I think this is also indicative of like the future split that's coming in the Republican Party.  You're going to have the Trumpists versus the establishment types.  You're going to have this very broad split.  And what you're seeing here is there could even be factions within the factions.  So, you know, the Q people are very pro-Trump.  Alex Jones is very pro-Trump.  But now they're turning on each other.  So it's almost like you had this coalition that was sort of kept together by Trump and people who don't normally agree with each other.  And then now that, you know, Trump is kind of imploding in a number of ways, he lost the election, he egged on this riot, like, there's all these problems now, and Trump's no longer that single unifying force, so all those factions are turning on each other.  And honestly, I mean, listen, we've seen the same thing sort of happen on the Bernie left.  There's now civil wars within the civil war on the Bernie left, or on the online left.  But now, this is the right-wing version of that.  And... It's getting ugly, but I'm kind of loving it.  Now I can't wait to see or hear about QAnon stuff where they turn on Alex and they try to act like he's part of the globalist plot that he's always been railing against for years and years and years.  I guarantee you something like that is probably coming.  These guys have no shame, no ethics, no morals, no commitment to the truth.  My guess is you ain't seen nothing yet with how ugly it all gets.
