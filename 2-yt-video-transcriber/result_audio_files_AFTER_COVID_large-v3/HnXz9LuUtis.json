            "text": "All right, I said I'm going to take three questions today.  So we've covered one about Bill Gates and the coronavirus.  Let's cover the second one.  What do we do?  As a pastor, I really treat my online church members just like my family.  And I know this is a real concern.  What do you do about the mark of the beast?  What happens if you're supposed to get mandatory vaccination?  All I can say is I'm going to walk you through it as I get word from the Lord.  Right now, it's not absolutely clear that there will be mandatory vaccination.  It's not clear that there will be an enforcement of a new digital currency.  But in my spirit, it looks like it's pretty close on the horizon.  So what should we do?  I would never tell you to not receive medical attention.  I couldn't do that.  You know, vaccination is required in Australia and our children probably couldn't go to school if they violate the vaccination requirements.  But if there is a medical procedure that you disagree with, this would be my Christian perspective, that you always have the right to decline.  So never say to the authorities, I refuse your Bill Gates vaccine, let's call it.  Don't say that because they're going to consider you fringe, maybe extreme.  But if you just ask them rational questions, can you guarantee me that there are no side effects to this vaccine?  Have studies proven that this vaccine is 100% safe for my child?  And if they answer no, you could rationally say, in the interests of your health and the health of your children, say, you know what, I respectfully decline the option to take this vaccine.  And that would be a very rational thing and an exercise of your individual right.  What should you do if digital currency comes into effect this year or sometime soon?  Again, I will walk you through it as I receive word from the Lord.  It's not a reality yet.  But right now I would say that you shouldn't be afraid.  You know when we change from using gold to using paper currency, it didn't mean that you were suddenly worshipping the Antichrist.  Then when we change from paper currency to plastic and electronic transfers of money, again it didn't mean if you became part of that system that you're worshipping the Antichrist.  Right now, I feel that if you had to switch from paper currency because it collapses, it is an aberration in the economy right now.  It's a temporary experiment in humanity.  We may then change into cryptocurrency, which is why I have been speaking about cryptocurrency for a long time.  I'm not giving you investment advice.  I'm telling you prophetically it's going to come.  When it does come, I don't see right now that accepting that cryptocurrency as a means of exchange would preclude you from going to heaven, would mean that you are somehow evil and you've sided with the devil.  No, there has to be something that demands spiritual allegiance, a change in allegiance.  And this is what we're watching for.  We don't really yet see that, but we know it's coming.  It's going to be called the mark of the beast.  And whoever introduces it really is going to be the beast, one of the antichrists who are coming.  And they're going to try to control and track us.  Let me do a third question from our online church member.  This dear sister wrote to me and asked about what should she do with estranged relatives who hurt us and never apologize, even though we hardly keep in touch.  Is praying for them enough?  Will they go to heaven or hell?  She then says, what about relatives or friends or family members who are offended by end-time teaching?  Or they deny the judicial Christ, biblical justice, They're usually grace-only people, and they started accusing me of promoting hate, and they accused me of being a fake Christian, when my intentions are merely sharing with them what I learn, the gospel, the truth, that most churches hardly touch on.  I was very affected by their attacks.  I'm not trying to show off and I am not trying to say I know more or know better than them.  I just want to share with them the gospel truth and the book of Revelation.  And I hope that they get it.  Will they go to heaven or hell?  Well, let me tell you, you're not alone about dealing with estranged relatives.  The Bible has a very clear answer about this.  The Bible gives us the litmus test of a true Christian.  A true Christian cannot hate.  A true Christian must love.  The Bible says, do not marvel, my brethren, if the world hates you.  In 1 John chapter 3, verse 14, we know that we have passed from death to life because we love the brethren.  He who does not love his brother abides in death.  Whoever hates his brother is a murderer.  And you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him.  So just like what Jesus said, if you hate a brother, you're already a murderer in your heart.  There's nobody I hate in the body of Christ.  There are people who attack me.  There are people who say defamatory things about me.  There are people who treat me in a way that I just didn't expect.  But I don't hate them.  I truly pray for them.  And I know that it's going to go bad for them if they don't repent.  So I try to reconcile.  But I know what you mean.  There are people like this.  And I truly believe that if you have hate in your heart and you can express that on a continual basis, you're probably a fake Christian.  You're probably one of those that Jesus says, I never knew you.  The Bible says this, by this we know love because he laid down his life for us.  And we also ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.  Well, there are people who won't even share time of their children with a relative.  You know, I know right now a case of a grandmother who won custody of the grandson.  And she refuses to let the mother and the other grandmother, the maternal grandmother, see the son.  Now, they all call themselves Christian, but guess what?  I don't believe it.  I don't believe that you can act in such a selfish way and be a safe person.  I don't care if you're on stage worshiping.  I don't care if you pretend in such a way that many pastors believe you.  There's no way... that if you can't even lay down a few minutes of your time, if you can't even deprive yourself of some narcissistic control over your child or your grandson, that you could be a Christian.  The Bible says that a real Christian lays down his life for others.  Verse 17, Meaning, if it's in your power to do something kind and nice and you refuse to do it, how is that possible?  you're a Christian?  And not only that, I know people who go to church who mistreat people who were nice to them.  You know, who sue people who let them live in a house for free.  I mean, it's so demonic and it's so disloyal that hell is the only place for such people.  John the Apostle of Love concluded in verse 21, Beloved, if our heart does not condemn us, we have confidence toward God.  This is how you pray.  You must have confidence.  And whatever we ask, we receive from Him because we keep His commandments and do those things that are pleasing in His sight.  How could suing people who help you, how could depriving a relative of time with their own son or grandson be pleasing to God the Father?  And this is His commandment, that we should believe on the name of His Son, Jesus Christ, and love one another as He gave commandment.  And so many Christians believe the outside, believe the surface, and don't ask, how do you love?  How do you love the person that you blame?  How do you love the person that you say is so bad to you?  Do you ever show love to them?  If you don't, you're not pleasing to Him.  You have no confidence when you ask in prayer.  And that's why you have many prayer failures.  You need to repent and get saved.  And I say this with all compassion.  that this is not the time.  The time is so short.  This is not the time to play around with toxic poison like hate and bitterness.  These things will, you know, you'll wake up in hell one day and you'll regret it forever.  Love your enemies.  Do good for those who persecute you and hate you.  Try to do good.  This is the test that I would ask as a pastor.  What kind of good do you do to your in-law, to your ex, to your colleague that bothers you at work, whoever it is in your past or your present that you think is so bad?  What good do you do for them?  Love them like Jesus Christ loves you.  I don't mean that you willingly subject yourself to someone who's abusive, someone who yells at you or is physically violent towards you, but there's always something good you can do, even from a distance.  There's always something good you can do.  And if your heart is right, you will have confidence when you pray.  And when you have that, you have faith.  You're walking by faith, not by feelings.  This is my call to all online church members.  Walk by faith at this time.  Walk by faith.  Believe God is good and God hears the prayers of the righteous.  Believe that God is on your side.  If you don't mistreat anyone, God is on your side.  But if you see a lot of failures in your life, a lot of things go wrong, you better check your love walk.  Don't justify yourself and end up going to hell.  That would be my answer to my online church member.  I think it's a risk.  I think people who are mistreating her as she's trying to share the book of Revelation, they're not showing me the fruit of the Spirit.  They're not showing me the fruit of love.  So how does God see them?  Only God knows.  I'm no one's judge.  But I would call upon any sincere Christian to check their love walk and make sure they do good to people that they don't like.  That's how we're going to survive the coronavirus.  That's how we're going to survive the Antichrist, if anyone is here listening at that time.  And that's how we're going to survive this evil world.  And Jesus will come back and usher us into the kingdom of God.  Join us now at patreon.com.  slash Ciccolanti.  You'll be one of 900 online church members right now.  And I'm believing God for at least 2,800.  You know why?  Because I've got 286,000 followers on YouTube.  And I figure if only 1%, if just 1% of that commit to supporting a gospel ministry and commit to being an online member, we would have at least 2,860 people.  And we should have more than 1%.  We're doing something that God has called us to do.  We're doing it effectively.  I think we're doing it as effectively online as any ministry out there.  and we're uncompromising with the truth, and we always emphasize Jesus Christ.  And we've been talking about end times before it was popular.  I'm happy to say that now end times has gone mainstream.  I even see financial guys like Jeff Berwick talking about the book of Revelation.  I think Robert Kiyosaki is talking more about God, and I don't know how sincere they are, but you know what?  God's going mainstream.  End time means Jesus is going mainstream.  One day it's going to be so uncool to not believe in Jesus.  So you get to come along on the ride now while God is advancing the kingdom.  Let's be a part of getting the truth out.  May the knowledge of the Lord cover the earth as the waters cover the seas.  That's my prayer.  Would you join me in that prayer? ",
