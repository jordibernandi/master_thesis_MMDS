            "text": "G'day guys, how you doing?  It's the Kiwi and I'm back with another video.  And yes, this is a follow-up video to the previous video about the dark side of the shadow.  But what I'm going to be doing is I'm going to start right from the beginning.  Yeah, I'm going to start right at the beginning and what we're going to do is we're going to slowly but surely work through this subject matter.  One of the... One of the things I really highly recommend doing or suggest is buying this book, Iron John by Robert Bly.  I've had this copy for about 10 years now.  It's gone with me all over the world.  I first got the book in 2004, the first copy I actually gave away.  But the reason why I recommend getting this book is it's a great way to track your progress, what's going on in your life and what's happening.  And it gives you an understanding of being able to correlate your journey with the shadow and how it's relating to you and how it's related to men for thousands of years.  This journey, this truly masculine experience, and it is a truly masculine experience, has been written about, like I said, for thousands of years.  It's the story of Achilles and the Battle of Troy.  It's the story of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table.  And as you travel this path and you read this book and you can see the correlations of your own life and the lives of hundreds of millions of men before you, and you're walking in the same footsteps as these people.  Now, the other thing that's really amazing about this is Carl Jung talked about this.  He's obviously one of the preeminent psychoanalysts of our time.  He is an absolute genius of a man, absolute genius of a man, because what he did was he didn't come up with theories and philosophies like Freud, who I call fraud, or Nietzsche.  Nietzsche didn't even want his work published.  It was his sister that published his works.  You know, Jung took ancient knowledge.  He took the studies of ancient practices, ancient knowledge, all these stories and applied them to other research and his own personal experience and he was able to really, really get his whole essence, his whole being around the subject of the masculine experience and also the experience of humanity.  So one of the things that he talked about, one of the key things that he talked about about this journey And how you actually start this journey is, believe it or not, and he said this.  This isn't something that was made up.  He's written this.  It's in print to this day.  You have to go your own way.  Say what?  You have to go your own way.  You have to leave the nest.  You have to be a man going your own way.  Say this isn't so.  It is.  It's the truth.  This is something I've been living for the last 16 years, since July of 2004.  As an individual, we need to be able to leave behind the comforts of our lives.  We need to leave behind what we have become... It's become ingrained in us.  And when stuff becomes ingrained in us, it doesn't matter what sort of life we've had.  We could have had an incredibly abusive life.  We could have lived a life of luxury.  It doesn't matter what end of the spectrum you're on.  We become comfortable with those aspects of our lives.  So comfortable that we will actually keep on trying to repeat those cycles throughout our life.  And that's why going our own way breaking out of the nest, breaking out of the comfort zone of our home, our parents, the roof that we've lived under, the social settings, the social dogmas, everything that we've become accustomed to, we need to move away from that.  Now, when we do this, I've mentioned this in comments on other videos.  One of the comments that I've made is that Darker the entrance into the frost, the darker the area where we enter the forest, the greater the journey.  Now what I mean by that is that we're taking a bigger jump.  We're taking a bigger leap of faith.  Most people just leave the nest and move into a home in the same town, same city.  They stay close to their parents, they stay close to what is socially normal to them, the social dogmas, the social rituals, whatever.  They don't expand their knowledge, so they just carry on the status quo.  That's not going your own way.  Some people will beat around the bush where they will move out of the town and they'll go stay in the same country, but they'll move to a different city.  They'll try to make their own way.  that is, I would say, entering the forest in a very lightly wooded area.  You can still see the sky, you can still see the clouds, you're still around the same group of people, the same social, economic situations, dogmas, et cetera, but you've kind of distanced yourself, you've given yourself a shot.  When I talk about heading into the forest in the darkest point possible, I'm talking about packing your bags, Getting on a plane or a ship and getting the fuck out of Dodge.  Going as far away as you possibly can.  Myself personally, I ended up in LA.  Now, I left Blenheim, New Zealand in 1989.  It was a town of 16,000 people.  I moved to a city of approximately 8 million.  At that time, that was four times the population of New Zealand or just under.  times the population in New Zealand.  When I landed at LAX Airport and walked out into the arrival areas, I was just like, oh my god.  I can see it to this day.  I couldn't get over it.  The parking structures, I've never seen parking structures like it.  In that amount of time, The moment I stepped out, I saw more cars and more people than I'd ever seen in my entire life.  Just at the airport, I was just blown away.  So that's what I mean by entering the forest in the darkest possible area.  You're really taking a massive leap of faith.  You're heading into the wilderness.  You have no clue what you're getting yourself into.  You are literally taking life by the balls.  Now what this does is it's like it opens up a door and it literally is telling the gods, okay, I'm at your mercy.  I have no clue what I'm doing.  Let's give it our best shot possible.  And I wasn't thinking that way when I did this.  I just... I just, I knew that if I was to improve my life, if I was to try to learn what I could, I wanted to become better and better and better at what I did.  And the only way I could do that was to get out of the town that I was living in.  And even New Zealand, there was nobody in New Zealand that was doing what I could see.  When I was looking at Formula One racing, I was looking at IndyCar racing, I was looking at all this amazing stuff overseas.  None of that was happening in New Zealand.  Because in 89, the country was only two years out from when it went bankrupt.  There was nothing happening here.  It was pathetic down here.  It was unbelievable.  So I had to make my own way.  I had to go out there.  I had been raised in an extremely abusive environment.  And because of that, there was also this level of... How could you word it?  Like this level of naivety where I wanted to prove to the world that I could do something.  I had this... It's in the book, I Am John.  They call them the flying boys, Peter Pan complex, that sort of stuff.  I wanted to be able to go out there into the world and actually really... prove something to the world.  it was like i felt i was special.  and um yeah it's amazing the twists and turns that life will take you down.  so what happens is you like i said you it's like you're leaving your life up to the gods.  it's like you're you're you.  you mentally can't really cope with what you're doing.  So you've just got to go.  And when you go, your mind kind of shuts down and it starts to allow this essence inside of yourself to evolve.  And what happened for me was I thought I deserved to be doing this.  I felt that I should be in the top, top, top tier as far as motorsport and everything like that.  And it was really amazing because... I was slowly pushed into, by the hand and twists of fate, into a job that was an incredible base of education where I had some mentors that were able to really embrace me and teach me some incredible stuff.  And it was amazing because those individuals, like Dave Kent, my first real true mentor, He was the one that set the stage and the foundation for me to be able to continue moving in the direction that I wanted to move in.  Now, I fell off the rails every once in a while, but I made my own way.  I put my faith... unconsciously, I put my faith in the hands of the gods.  And literally, that's how my life has really been playing out, in all honesty, since 89, if I really think about it.  So that's one of the first real phases.  You have to get away from the environment that you're in.  We have to take this initial first massive step and we have to move away from the nest.  We have to move away from the comfort of our lives.  We have to really, really, really put our hands and our faith and everything about us literally in the hands of a higher power, whatever that power may be.  And Carl Jung talks about it.  He openly says that.  It's what's mentioned in In this book, right at the beginning, it's where they mention, you know, the young boy finds the key to unlock the cage that the wild man is in under his mother's pillow.  And his mother's pillow is a representation.  The mother is the nurturing, the caregiver, the person that's taking care of you and looking after you.  feeding you and making sure that you're clothed and warm and safe.  and the pillow exemplifies the the luxury of the life that yet that young boy was living and he finds the key to his journey under the mother's pillow where he goes and unlocks the cage and And actually releases the wild man.  This individual called Iron John.  This dark, hairy giant that carries him off into the forest.  And it's very interesting how they utilize the terms of this hairy, dirty, ancient man.  Because that's what our soul is.  It's this ancient, eternal... entity that lives inside of us that's connected to everything and if you you turn your life over to that it will take you on a journey where you can be a witness to some of the most incredible stuff.  but you it's like you have to just about stay disjointed.  you know like you're a witness to everything that's not only going on with you but to everything else that's in front of you.  And I can tell you that now based on my own experience, my own journey and what I've seen.  Because I didn't understand this, because I didn't know it intrinsically, what happened was I would fight it.  I would battle with it.  I would push away and I'd try to force myself to go back down this path that I thought that I should be going down.  And then something would whip the world out from underneath me and get me back going on the path and the direction that I needed to be going in.  And one of the greatest things that happened was actually my divorce.  I was actually meeting my wife and then going through the divorce.  Because at some point, we will experience some sort of catastrophe.  We will go through some sort of experience where everything will come bubbling to the surface and we'll feel like we want to break free.  And our mind, because the experience is so traumatic, our mind will shut down.  and this essence will start coming to the surface again, and it will actually start taking you back down.  It'll take you off the path that you think you should be going down and slowly bring you back to the path that you are meant to be going down.  Because there's this wonderful saying, life is what happens while you're making other plans.  Now our plans, we're always wanting to.  I should be doing this.  This is what I deserve.  This is my life.  This is where I want to be going.  And then you'll get smacked around.  The rug will get pulled out from underneath you.  You'll go through a divorce.  You'll lose a job.  You'll have all these catastrophes happening in your world that will bring you back down this path.  And it's incredible.  There's actually a couple of channels out there right now.  One of the best ones, I actually think, is a dude's named Ben.  And his channel's called Bald and Bankrupt.  Well, he went through a divorce and he just started traveling to basically get away from his pain from the divorce, I would say, in some way, shape or form.  And he started recording his travels and now he's got this amazing YouTube channel with millions upon millions of followers.  And he doesn't realize, I don't think he realizes just really the journey that he's on.  I don't think he really understands the gift that he's actually giving his viewers because he's a man, he's literally a man that's going his own way all over the bloody world.  I mean, he's really amazing, truthfully.  So that's our first step, the first step in understanding and connecting And understanding our shadow is actually going our own way.  It's amazing, you know, getting out of the nest, getting away from our socioeconomic environment, getting away from the dogmas of our society and putting ourselves out there literally at the mercy of just the gods and everything around us.  And if you do that, your journey will be pretty amazing.  It really will.  So I'm going to leave that right here.  I'm going to let you guys ponder that.  If you can, get this book, download it, and start reading it.  And honestly, start looking at your life.  Start looking around you.  Start seeing what it is that you could possibly do to spice it up a little bit.  Rock the boat.  The status quo is never a good place to be.  So Anyway, there's going to be a lot more on this subject.  So I will leave it there and I'll be talking to you guys soon.  Okay, take care. ",
