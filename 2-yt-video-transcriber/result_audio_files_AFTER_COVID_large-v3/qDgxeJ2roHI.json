            "text": "Holy shit, y'all, Trump got COVID.  And look, I know everybody's busy popping bottles and making dancing memes and stuff, but I just, I cannot allow myself to believe this will ultimately be a good thing.  I'm sorry.  It's just not like 2020 to let us have something like this, you know?  It ain't.  It'd be like your schoolyard bully giving you a gift bag on your birthday.  You know that president's got poop in it?  That's just how Daryl is.  I mean, what are the possible outcomes here?  If he gets over it with ease, that's horrible.  Because for his base, that's like a bunch of North Korean officials watching Kim Jong-un sink a hole in one.  It's just going to confirm the absurd shit they never should have believed in the first place.  They're going to be like, hey liberals, I thought you said this virus was worse for old people and fat people, huh?  Well, who you knows more old and fat than our guy?  Nobody, and he's doing fine.  And he's dumb.  And if he actually struggles with the virus, you know for a fact he's going to use that as an excuse to try to delay the election, and his base will eat that shit up.  Well, hell, at my job, if you get sick, they fire you and take your health insurance away.  But the same guy that my boss donates money to is expected to go through with an election?  Ridiculous.  And lastly, dare I say it, if he dies, if he actually dies, well, then we might end up with President Pence.  And I hesitate to say anything would be worse than Trump, but fuck that shit.  President Pence, that motherfucker's straight out of an 80s slasher movie about a killer pilgrim.  Seriously, I bet his wife keeps a little corn doll in her bonnet that she uses to control his actions with.  No.  So yeah, I'm gonna have to take a wait-and-see approach to this, but I don't blame y'all a bit for being celebratory, you know?  I mean, you got a lot of reasons to be.  See, on February 27th of this year, Donald Trump promised that we would soon have zero cases of coronavirus in this country.  Fast forward seven months, and over 200,000 Americans are dead from it.  Not to mention the economy.  About 28 million Americans are either receiving unemployment or waiting to be approved for it.  And people of color are disproportionately affected by the virus.  They contract and die from COVID at a rate higher than their white counterparts.  And now, after all that, Trump has it?  Yeah, go off, Twitter.  I don't blame you a bit.  One little tip, though.  When you're trying to explain to Trumpettes how you feel about this, keep in mind that they are upset and frightened by big words and foreign shit.  So the concept of schadenfreude may take them a minute.  Other than that, have a good time.  Oh, hell, I almost forgot.  Melania got it too.  But I mean, she'll be fine.  Hell, she's probably glad she caught it.  It'll keep her from having to do all the White House Halloween planning.  Why the fuck should I have to do Halloween stuff?  American kids, they fat.  They don't need candy anyway.  At least the kids in Kansas, they're skinny.  Fuck the Halloween stuff.  I don't want to die.  The other day, I saw a husband have a meeting with pointy-headed ghosts.  Let them do Halloween stuff. ",
