We basically want the military to sit on the sidelines because we have civilian control of the military rather than military control of The government.  The individual in question, as far as I could determine from the uniform, was not a commissioned officer.  If she was, she'd be in serious trouble under the UCMJ.  In this particular case of the young woman who's been videotaped, probably somebody ought to take her aside and say, you know, it's a good idea to keep your political views to yourself when you're in uniform.  If you're not in uniform, basically the sky's the limit.  But while you're in uniform, you shouldn't be doing politics.  And I think she'd get the message.  Take off your uniforms!  Take off your uniforms! ",
