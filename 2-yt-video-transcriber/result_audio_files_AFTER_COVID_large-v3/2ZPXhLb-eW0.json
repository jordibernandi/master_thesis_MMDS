And there are far more people who hear the rhetoric than there are who hear the facts, which is the reason we're writing the book in the first place.  The rhetoric says, look, when you put them all together nationwide, charter schools and traditional public schools, there's really not much difference.  And in a sense, that's true, but it's like many things that are true and totally misleading.  The white students plus Asian students are a majority of the students in traditional public schools nationwide.  Black students plus Hispanic students are a majority of the students in charter schools nationwide.  Now, for years, generations, white students and Asian students have been scoring higher than black students and Hispanic students.  Now, when the charter schools come along and close the gap, the people say, well, the charter schools are no better than the others.  If they're no better than the others, how come the others had this huge gap for generations on end, and now the charter schools have closed the gap?  My book, the data I collect, compares students who are comparable, that is, in more than 100 New York City schools, There are charter schools and traditional public schools holding classes in the same building.  And in all the cases in my sample, blacks and Hispanics add up to a majority in both kinds of schools.  And so we're now comparing comparable populations, incomparable neighborhoods, going in the same buildings.  And when you do that, you find that on the statewide mathematics test, 10% of the students in the traditional public schools in those buildings passed the math test.  And in the charter schools, 68% passed the test. ",

Traditional public schools are unlike virtually any other institutions I can think of offhand.  Every kind of institution, whether it's a sports league, it's a medical facility, a church, automobile dealerships, they have a clientele.  And they must attract that clientele and hold that clientele if they want to survive as institutions.  That is not true of traditional public schools.  Compulsory attendance laws means they are supplied with a clientele regardless of whether they educate them properly or don't.  Moreover, public schools don't even compete with each other because each one has a monopoly in some particular territory. ",

The new legislation last year that I referred to is imposing on charter schools the same bad practices that are in the traditional public schools.  See, the idea behind charter schools initially was that they would be freer to experiment since they wouldn't be covered by all the minute regulations that apply to the traditional public schools.  And if they came up with things, that was successful educationally, then the traditional public schools would have the option of adopting these things.  What has happened has been the exact opposite.  That when the charter schools come up with something that contributes to their turning out a better educational result, the backlash is to impose, restrict the charter schools and impose the things that are failing in the traditional public schools.  For example... The new legislation last year makes it virtually impossible to seriously punish any student who simply disrupts the classes of the schools that they're in.  Now, one of the things that charter schools do is have some sense of discipline so that kids who act out, hit other kids, yell and carry on until the class can't go on, they can be suspended.  Now, they cannot be under California law. ",
