            "text": "On this very special report on our YouTube channel, I'm going to be sharing with you a story that very few people know.  This story was related to me many, many years ago while I was ministering here in Cleveland, Tennessee.  And so I want to get right into this for the next few moments.  And I want you to bear with me as I share this because it's going to come to a very interesting dream that a woman had many years ago that does appear to be in the early stages of coming to pass.  Back in the 1980s, I was ministering at a church here in town called the North Cleveland Church of God.  During the service, there was a young lady from what was then Lee College that was attending that had come up to the altars to be ministered to.  And of course, we were praying there, I myself, with the pastor and his staff, with all the people that were present in the altars.  And when the service was over, I was standing beside the assistant pastor whose name was C.E.  French, a very distinguished older minister with an impeccable reputation in the denomination called the Church of God.  He shared with me that the young lady that I had been praying for was the granddaughter of a man named Jack Matthews.  And Jack Matthews had been a pastor at a church of God in Renz, Georgia.  And Dr.  French said, as a matter of fact, there's an incident that happened there many years ago.  I'd like to tell you about it.  Have a  seat.\".  So I never will forget this.  Most of the people were by that time gone and had left the building.  This was in the evening.  It was a night service.  And Dr.  French and I sat down on the second seat to the right side in the old sanctuary of this church called the North Cleveland Church of God.  Dr.  French said, I want to share with you a very, very interesting story.  He said, many years ago, I was preaching in Wrens, Georgia at the Wrens Church of God for Pastor Jack Matthews, who was the grandfather of this young girl that I talked to just a moment ago and introduced you to.  And he said that the... It was a Sunday morning, and a man walked up to us and said, Pastor, if you and Dr.  French, you and your wife and Dr.  French and his wife would like, my wife would like to cook dinner for you.  If you'll come on over, she'll prepare it.  And so... brother French looked at the pastor and said, that's totally up to you.  And the pastor said, we'll go ahead and come over.  That'll be fine.  Well, the pastor then began to share with Dr.  French some very interesting things.  He said, now, brother French, as you go to this woman's house today, I want to warn you about her.  She's going to seem very, very strange and very, very odd.  However, If she says something to you that the Lord talked to her and told her something about you, go ahead and write it down and believe it because she hears from the Lord.  And he began to tell Dr.  French about some times that they needed financial breakthroughs.  And she would, this woman, and this woman's name was Mary Rouse.  Mary would sit at a, behind what they called the parsonage, which was the home of the pastor.  And she would sit on a tree stump and wake him up in the morning praying for him.  He could hear her outside at sunrise praying.  And they always managed to get great results when Mary prayed.  So she was a very, very amazing praying woman.  Well, Mary Rouse was originally a Methodist school teacher and she was now attending this church that C.E.  French had preached at, her and her husband.  Well, what happened is they went over to the house and they were in the living room talking and Mary walked in and she was opening a can.  He said it was a can of something she was going to put on the stove and said, well, Dr.  French, I have a word for you from the Lord.  And he said, well, what is it?  And she said to him, well, if you was close to God, you wouldn't have to ask me.  You'd have got it yourself.  And she turned around and walked back in the kitchen.  Well, the pastor could tell that he kind of surprised Brother French and the husband could tell.  He said, the husband sat down and said, Dr.  French, let me show you something here.  Well, Sister French went in the kitchen to help Mary cook.  And so the guys were together.  And so the husband went in and grabbed a book that had all kinds of cards in it.  And I'm talking about cards like, you know, birthday cards, etc.  And he said, Dr.  French, I want you to look at this.  When he opened the book, there were beautiful cards to marry from President Eisenhower's wife, Mamie Eisenhower.  And Brother French said, what are these?  Where did she get these?  Well, he said, these are birthday cards from when President Eisenhower's wife, when they were in office, and she gets one about every year from her.  Really?  Wow, amazing.  He said, well, let me tell you why she gets these cards.  Many years ago, and this would have been under President Eisenhower, my wife was really, really deep in prayer, and she had a vision that a leader from Turkey and a leader from another nation had been secretly brought to the White House, and that President Eisenhower was going to make a secret agreement between these two world leaders, and it was not from the Lord.  It was going to cause great heartache, not only for Eisenhower, but for the country in the future.  Well, Mary, not knowing how to contact the president, gets the number to the White House and says, this is Mary Rouse from Renz, Georgia, and I have a message from the president he is now secretly meeting with.  And this was late in the evening, of course.  This is back in the day when you could sneak people in and out of the White House with the press knowing about it a long time ago.  Wouldn't be that way today.  And she said he's meeting with, and she named the two world leaders.  She said he's in a secret meeting.  He's getting ready to sign this paper.  And you tell him, I said he can't do it to avoid it, to stay away from it.  Well, the lady apparently took the notes down at the White House.  But then sometime later.  She had government agents to come to her home.  They began to question her about this.  Now, I'm talking about this was just a few hours after that she called the White House.  And the government agents identified themselves as being with the president, being with the White House.  And they said, we need to have some information.  because they they live.  you know georgia is a kind of an area that has a lot of military bases so they were going to figure out if she was a spy somehow for turkey or one of these countries because no one knew about this meeting between these two world leaders.  well when they when they did the research and found it out that she was just a praying woman they contacted the white house back to let the president know who the woman was and she was simply in prayer.  Well, guess what happened?  Eisenhower sent the two men home without making the secret deal at all.  So that made her very famous with the Eisenhower family.  So there were the cards identifying that Mamie Eisenhower had wished her a happy birthday every year.  Occasionally in the earlier time, actually sent her flowers.  BECAUSE SHE KNEW THAT WHATEVER SHE HAD PRAYED AND SAID AFFECTED HER HUSBAND THAT GREATLY.  AND FOR HER TO KNOW SOMETHING SECRET THAT NO ONE ELSE KNEW.  SO SHE SAW SOMETHING IN SECRET WHICH IS SIMILAR WHEN YOU READ IN THE BIBLE ABOUT THE PROPHET OF GOD.  THAT THE BIBLE TELLS US.  THAT THE SYRIANS WERE SECRETLY PLOTTING TO COME INTO ISRAEL AND INVADE THE COUNTRY.  BUT THE PROPHET PRAYED AND ACTUALLY SAW THE PLANS THAT THE KING OF SYRIA AND HIS MILITARY WAS MAKING IN SECRET AND MADE THEM PUBLIC TO ISRAEL.  And of course, when the Syrians got there, the Israelite army was not there.  So it's almost on that same pattern of that story you read in the Bible.  Now, the part that I want to share with you, and this is very important that you hear me share this, is a part that C.E.  French told me of a vision that Mary had that she said was going to come to pass somewhere in the future.  And it would involve leaders in Washington, D.C.  And it would involve someone that would enter the White House.  In other words, when this person, she didn't say who it was.  She didn't see when it was.  She just said there would be a president in the United States.  And he said, during this time, here's what you're going to see.  AND IN THIS VISION THAT SHE HAD, IT WAS MORE OF A VISION THAN A DREAM, SHE SAW THE FRONT OF THE WHITE HOUSE.  NOW YOU KNOW HOW THE WHITE HOUSE HAS THAT CURVE ON IT WITH THOSE LARGE POSTS.  ON TOP OF THE WHITE HOUSE WERE BLACK BIRDS.  AND I'LL GIVE YOU THE BIBLICAL DEFINITION OF WHAT THAT CAN REPRESENT IN A MINUTE.  THEY WERE BLACK BIRDS AND EACH HAD A PADLOCK IN ITS MOUTH.  And the voice spoke to her and said this.  There will come a time when the government of the United States is going to attempt to lock the Protestant churches in America where they are not able to have services.  Now, we know that with Corona, there has been.  CHURCHES THAT HAVE BEEN TOLD.  THEY CAN'T MEET.  THERE HAVE BEEN LIMITATIONS OF JUST TEN PEOPLE ONLY.  THERE HAVE BEEN, THERE HAS BEEN A PERMISSION TO DO INTERNET SERVICES, BUT NOT GATHERINGS.  AND IF THIS CONTINUES OR IF THIS MUTATES OR IF THE, UH, IT GOES INTO ANOTHER LEVEL OR IF THERE'S ANOTHER PANDEMIC, IT'S VERY, VERY POSSIBLE.  THAT CHURCHES WILL BE ASKED TO JUST LOCK THEIR DOORS.  AND ON THE SECOND SIDE OF THIS THAT YOU DON'T HEAR REPORTED OFTEN THAT I HEAR THE REPORTS OF IS.  THERE ARE CHURCHES THAT ARE ACTUALLY PADLOCKING THEIR DOOR AND SHUTTING THEIR DOOR because the people have not returned and they're not able to pay their payments.  They're not able to pay their mortgages.  And I know in one state, one city, there's five churches now shut down.  And there's other churches that we're getting reports with on a consistent basis that are shut down.  And a recent report said that 45 percent of the Christians who attend church are no longer going back to churches, maybe at all, that they're just going to go to the Internet.  And this is really bad on the churches in America.  NOW THE REASON A BLACK BIRD WAS SEEN, IN MY OPINION, IS NOT BECAUSE OF THE COLOR OF THE BIRD.  IT WOULD MAKE NO DIFFERENCE IF IT WAS A WHITE BIRD, BLACK BIRD, YELLOW BIRD, RED BIRD, WHATEVER.  BUT THE COLOR OF THAT PARTICULAR BIRD, IT WAS LIKE A BIRD WHICH WAS AN UNCLEAN ANIMAL BECAUSE THERE'S KOSHER BIRDS AND UNCLEAN BIRDS in the Bible.  A dove would be a kosher bird.  A raven, for example, that existed at the time of the flood is a non-kosher bird.  And I'm talking about in Judaism at this point.  Not that we make an issue about that, but it's interesting.  Now, these particular birds in the Bible, a bird, if you go to the parable of the sower sowing the seed, the sower sows the word of God, he sows the seed.  And it says the birds come to steal the seed and before it can take root.  And in the parable, Jesus says that these birds represent evil spirits that come in and try to steal the word which is sown.  Therefore... The interpretation of those birds are not literal birds, but they represent spirits that are going to come out of the White House and spirits that's going to come out of leadership, of which they will attempt to shut down churches.  Now, I do believe that there's one leader, and that is President Trump, that is pro-church, that would never allow anything like that to happen.  I do believe and I think you that know what this party represents and what they're saying and the radicals behind it that are trying to rule it would not think twice about shutting down churches or limiting religion because they see religion as non-essential.  They see Christianity as a threat.  They see the Bible as a hate book instead of a book of truth.  And so I think that we could be in those times.  Now, again... as other things that we share with you from time to time.  This is only something that time will tell.  It is only something that can be discerned as time progresses.  Do I believe that that will happen at some point?  Absolutely, because this was a godly woman.  This is a woman that had an impeccable reputation OF HEARING FROM THE LORD ACCORDING TO DR.  FRENCH AND OTHERS.  THAT KNEW HER.  AND WHEN SHE SAID GOD SPOKE TO HER, YOU COULD MARK IT DOWN, GOD SPOKE TO HER, ESPECIALLY WHEN THE WIFE OF A FORMER PRESIDENT IS SENDING HER CARDS THANKING HER FOR HER PRAYERS AND TO CONTINUE TO PRAY FOR THEIR FAMILY.  SO I WANTED TO SHARE THIS INFORMATION WITH YOU.  AND TELL YOU THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT BELIEVERS CAN DO, NOW BELIEVERS BEING THOSE WHO TAKE THE WORD OF GOD AND WE TAKE THIS BOOK AS GOD'S INSPIRED WORD.  WE BELIEVE IN PRAYER.  WE PRAY ONLY TO ONE GOD.  WE DON'T BELIEVE IN MULTIPLE GODS.  NOT EVERY RELIGION IS A WAY TO GET THERE.  WE DO BELIEVE THERE'S ONE GOD THAT EXISTS, YAHWEH GOD, THAT HIS SON CHRIST DIED FOR OUR SINS AND THROUGH HIM WE RECEIVE REDEMPTION AND ETERNAL LIFE.  THAT'S WHAT WE BELIEVE AS BELIEVERS.  And so it's important that no matter what level you believe you're on as a believer, you may consider yourself kind of weak in the faith, kind of pretty strong or very strong in the faith, that we have to stick together as one.  Our country is in danger of being lost and we're gonna turn this country into something that our grandchildren will never know, the country that we had growing up.  We've got to stop it.  We've got to stop it now.  We've got to stand up.  We've got to speak up, and we've got to stick together.  There are tens of millions of Americans who have read the crisis and discerned the crisis and can see what is coming, but we can't go away silently and have them shut us up.  The secular media wants to shut all of us up.  Got news for you.  It's not going to happen.  Even if the Lord has to use business people to raise up other companies and other places of getting information, he'll do that because God has not forsaken the United States of America.  Although we've seen selective judgment, we know we do things that have displeased him in his word.  He still has a remnant of people who are faithful to him in the United States.  And that's the people I hope I'm speaking to right now.  Now, don't forget that.  There's a lot more of these specials that will be coming out.
