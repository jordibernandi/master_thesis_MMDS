Let me tell you, I hate porn all the time.  Cut to a single.  Just of norm, really?  Gay porn.  I enjoy gay porn.  I'm not gay.  Gay porn is a genre that just cuts across all demographics.

Well, it is finally official.  Murder is legal in the state of California.  A down-and-out O.J.  Simpson, depressed that all of his money-making ideas have failed, has decided to go back to doing what he does best, killing people.  A new book claims that Madonna once smeared peanut butter all over John F. Kennedy  Jr.'s  body and then licked it up.  Which just goes to show you, Madonna's a whore.  And finally, Weekend Update would like to congratulate Madonna, who gave birth to a beautiful baby girl last Monday.  The baby weighed in at 6 pounds 9 ounces, making it the fourth largest object ever to pass through Madonna's birth canal.  This week at a secret ceremony in Australia, Michael Jackson was married for the second time.  Asked what makes his new bride special, the king of pop said, quote, she has taught me about the power of imagination, like imagining that a grown woman is a 10-year-old boy.  You know he's a homosexual pedophile, right?  You understand?  Sources report that Michael Jackson's baby is due February 27th and it's going to be named Michael Jackson Jr.  Michael plans to be with the mother during the delivery.  In his words, to make up for not being there for the country... Sources report that Michael Jackson's baby is due February 27th.  It's conception.  The last word was conception, so... Men or women?  Well, according to a new survey, 55% of adults feel that women are most responsible for minor fender benders, while 78% blame men for most fatal crashes.  Please note that the percentage in these pie graphs do not add up to 100% because the math was done by a woman.  For those of you hissing at that joke, it should be noted that that joke was written by a woman.  Now you don't know what the hell to do.  No, I'm just kidding.  We don't hire women.  I came in, and he was supposed to be kind of my guide through SNL, and it turned out that he is a shitster.  I'm not going to guide any lady through comedy.

Last week at a dramatic press conference about the crash of TWA Flight 800, ABC News correspondent Pierre Salinger displayed a document which he believes is proof that the jet was shot down by a U.S.  Navy missile.  Later, he proudly showed reporters his solid gold Rolex that he bought on the street for just $15.  That's one ugly bastard, isn't it?  Yeah.  Here we see the president and the first bitch.  Gosh, Hillary looks pretty in this photo here, doesn't she?  I never realized there was such a looker until I see her here in this picture.  In Whitewater News, federal regulators quizzed Hillary Clinton at the White House this week and gave her a perfect score on the lying section.  She's a dirty liar.  You know, of course, they say the White House is haunted.  Did you know that?  And I thought this was kind of sad.  I heard last night that President Clinton charged Abraham Lincoln's ghost 10,000 to sleep in his own bed.  So that's... That doesn't seem right to me, you know?  But look, the president, you know, has come under a lot of fire for raising money, but, you know, he's good at it.  He's good at raising money.  That's not a bad thing.  Every president's done it.  It's just that President Clinton is very, very, very good at it.  Do you know he has organized in the past year over 100 fundraising dinners and over 200 fundraising midnight snacks?  Did you know that?  Is he laughing?  Is he... This one says, remember the old days when tweeting meant stabbing a hooker?  Bob liked that one.

There are already plans, as a matter of fact.  Hold on, folks.  We have some breaking news to report here.  This just off the wire.  Reuters News is reporting now that the Mike Tyson app has just raped another app.  Once again, and we cannot confirm this, but reports are flooding out of Arizona this evening that the Mike Tyson app has, quote, viciously raped another app.  More on this as it develops.  Some gold-plated chains would make a nice retirement gift for a very, very good slave.  Are you serious?  Well, this was written... Are you serious?  This was written years ago.  Did you just write that?  I didn't write it.  Did you just say that?  No, I read it, yes.  You read that?  It was an old... Oh, my God almighty.  I'm not part of this.  No, it was written before...
