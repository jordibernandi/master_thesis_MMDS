You're not going to give me a supervisor?  Okay.  There's no sense in me getting you a supervisor.  You need to get one so you don't do something stupid.  Hi, guys.  Here at FedEx in Garner, North Carolina.  I want to see if they respect their right to record out here in public.  This is NC Tire Hunter.  Out here on this 30 degree morning.  Got a cam back, guys.  It's like we got a snowflake.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Contact.  How can I help you out?  Can you get me a cup of coffee?  No, sure can't.  How can I help you out?  If you can't give me no coffee, I guess you can't help me.  No, maybe not.  I can ask you what you're doing.  Yeah, you can ask?  Yeah.  You want to tell me?  Don't need to.  What?  Say what?  I couldn't.  oh look at that.  they're closing the gate.  oh that hurt my feelings.  that hurt my feelings.  oh my goodness that really hurt my feelings.  y'all.  they closed the gate on me.  oh no what do i do?  what do i do now?  I wish I was.  What's up?  You just got called about your suspicious activity.  you got out here.  Suspicious?  Yeah.  Really?  How's it going?  Good man.  So what's suspicious about standing out here?  Reporting people.  They're doing a lot of their work in there, right?  From a reasonable person's standpoint?  Uh, not this day and age, right?  Did they ask you to leave?  No.  Okay, so if I call them and they say they didn't, is that the case?  Yeah, they never... They actually stated that they asked you to leave.  Leave what?  Leave their property.  Where's their property at?  You're on it right now.  No, we're not.  This is their driveway.  No, it don't matter.  But you know better than that.  You know better than that.  When you're sitting over here... There's an easement, man.  You know all that, dude.  They gotta be somewhere to walk.  Right, you're trying to bullshit a bullshitter.  You're not happening today, Chief.  I understand who you are.  It don't matter who I am.  I can stand right here.  That is the easement, too.  You're sitting on the grass, which is taken care of by them, which is on their property.  Just because they take care of the grass don't mean it's theirs.  I suggest you look at the GIS survey.  I understand you've got nothing else better to do than to try to set us up.  That's the side of the point.  This is what I do.  Don't be a jackass now.  Don't be a jackass.  You gotta call names now?  I said don't be one.  I didn't call you one, did I?  I'm trying to be polite with you.  What's your name anyway?  My name's Officer Strong.  Strong?  Spelled like stretching.  Strong.  I got you, man.  What's your name?  Puddin' Tank.  Puddin' Tank?  Puddin' Tank, yeah.  Ask me again, I'll tell you the same.  You heard of it, right?  No.  Well, now you have.  Okay.  What does it mean?  So take that bullshit somewhere else.  You know we can stand right here all fucking day long, cuz.  No, you can't.  Watch me.  Okay, well, let me go talk to them, and if they said, yeah, we came out here and asked you to leave... It don't matter if they told me a hundred times to leave.  I'm not on their property, Chief.  If you're on the sidewalk... I suggest you get a supervisor out here.  If you're on the sidewalk... I'm asking for a supervisor.  Okay, call them.  No, you call them.  I asked for one.  I asked for a supervisor.  Okay.  You're not going to get me a supervisor?  Okay.  There's no sense in me getting you a supervisor.  You need to get one so you don't do something stupid.  You obviously understand the law, I guess.  Evidently better than you do about these men, dude.  Why do you got to swear, man?  Because that's what I do.  That's what I do.  I'm a grown man.  I can swear all day.  I'm going to tell us this is their property and you don't even know if it is or not.  You hadn't even looked, had you? ",
