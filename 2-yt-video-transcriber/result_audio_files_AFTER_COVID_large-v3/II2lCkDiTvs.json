            "text": "It's no secret to anyone who watches this channel that both multi-level marketing companies and religious systems are subject to devolving into destructive cults if handled unwisely or unethically.  What I haven't yet spoken about, however, is how MLMs often use pre-existing religious practices and narratives to manipulate people and make money.  If you've ever looked at an MLM or its distributors and thought their language, worldview, epistemology, culture or events were eerily similar to certain popular religious movements, or if you've ever noticed that people in certain religious communities seem to get recruited into MLMs very easily, you've noticed a real trend.  I don't think that trend is coincidental.  Instead, I posit that multi-level marketing companies purposely use pre-existing religious ideas and practices to influence people for their own gain.  Here, we'll cover two ways that MLMs accomplish this, through the imitation of religious practices and through the repurposing of religious theologies and narratives.  I'll divide the video into three sections, two of which I will cover and one of which a special guest of mine will cover.  Make sure you stay tuned for that.  Altered States A common trait within many religions is ritual practice which induces altered psychological states.  Meditation, chanting, singing, playing or listening to music, fasting, spinning or circling, and using mind-altering substances are just some of the religious practices which alter practitioners' minds.  These altered states can facilitate group cohesion and loyalty to the faith by providing individuals with apparently meaningful or even blissful psychological experiences.  MLMs often imitate this feature of religion to cultivate behavior among their distributors, which benefits the company.  The most obvious way most MLMs do this is through the programming at their yearly conferences.  While these events are called business conferences, they just serve to emotionally motivate distributors to buy more inventory and believe in themselves rather than actually give distributors the tools they need to sell product.  After all, a distributor buying inventory because they have a dream of entrepreneurship even if they don't ever sell anything and a customer buying a lot of product both make the company money all the same.  Listen to this clip from a supposedly professional business lecture from an MLM conference and you tell me what it reminds you of. ",

            "text": "Shake someone's hand on your right and left and say, it's my time.  Hard to believe that's not an evangelical Christian church service, huh?  Well, that's the whole idea.  The music, the cadence, the group vocalization, and the over-the-top positive rhetoric delivered in a place far from the grounding reality of home all serve to evoke emotion in the audience.  It lulls you into an altered state of mind where you're excited, optimistic, and passionate, and thus susceptible to the company's request to make them a priority in your life and buy and sell more of their inventory.  They control your environment to make you vulnerable, and then they hit you with a sales pitch that you don't even see coming.  It's interesting how these conferences, usually based in Christian-majority countries, induce altered states in similar ways to mainline Christianity.  My guess is that they mimic the practices of the majority faith amongst their distributors because it's less likely to be recognized as manipulative.  To most, it would feel normal since it's similar to their church services, and there's no need to be cautious of something that just feels so familiar.  The altered state-inducing motivational content is present in many, many forms at these conferences, but it goes even beyond that.  Distributors are encouraged to consume motivational content in the form of books and lectures in their everyday lives, too.  Most MLMs have preferred literature and recorded lectures they recommend to their distributors.  They're often called business tools, a resource people should use to empower themselves and build their business.  In reality, though, they're a tool the company uses to place their distributors in heightened emotional states where they're more likely to make risky business decisions because they believe in themselves.  Financial risk for the distributor means financial gain for the MLM.  Alright, now I'm going to send you over to my special guest who has a whole channel dedicated to criticizing and debunking the rhetoric of MLMs.  They researched and co-wrote this entire video, have written for my channel before, have inspired several of my biggest videos on MLMs, and now make their own video essays very similar to mine.  I think they're probably going to become one of the absolute biggest anti-MLM channels on YouTube in due time.  So here's a face you'll probably recognize from a channel that you need to see, the anti-bot. ",

            "text": "The Salvation Narrative.  In many religions, especially religions in the West where many MLMs are headquartered, persists a salvation narrative.  The salvation narrative boils down to the idea that humans are inherently bad or sinful and deserving of death and destruction.  In order to be delivered from certain death and separation from God, the adherent must take specific actions or make a Testament of faith to be rectified to their God and receive eternal life.  Many MLMs have hijacked this concept of salvation.  but have replaced the God figure with the MLM opportunity.  And instead of the dividing line being between eternal life or eternal damnation, the dividing line is between a joyful fulfilled life or a miserable unfulfilled life.  In order to recruit new members, MLMers portray their opportunity as the one and only way to find success and happiness in life.  An MLM pitch is communicated to the potential recruit as an almost good news message.  But instead of taking up your cross and following Jesus, you're forking over your money and following a scam artist.  MLMers are on a mission to bring their good news message to the needy and troubled.  After all, they can't possibly keep something that has been so radically life-changing to themselves.  Once they find a willing and sometimes unwilling poor soul they can pitch to, they will swoop in with their message of salvation.  An essential part of any good MLM pitch is the story of how the MLM company changed the individual's life for the better.  Their life prior to their MLM is always described as dark, depressed, and hopeless.  And their life with their MLM is always described as joyful, empowering, and hopeful.  Basically, they're born-again boss babes.  And they proceed to say that you can be born again too if you just put your trust in their company.  Oh, and also pay them $150 for their starter kit.  So many are on the hunt for a panacea to solve all their problems.  And someone less educated on MLMs may see the MLM opportunity as a cure-all and take the bait.  It's quite natural for people to want to have a hope for a better future.  And it's disgusting that MLMs have used this to line their own pockets.  To keep members involved with the MLM, the company sustains a narrative that if you were to ever leave, your life would certainly spiral out of control.  They claim that you would slave away at your nine to five job, barely making ends meet, never accomplish anything meaningful, and retire on little to nothing in your bank account.  It's fire and brimstone preaching. ",

Place first your faith in the MLM, they say, and then all these things will be given unto  you.\".  This narrative is actually pretty consistent with the idea of heaven and hell that is found in many religions.  What's ironic is that the data shows that almost everyone involved in MLMs experience the very thing that these companies say will happen to you if you don't join.  Almost everyone loses in an MLM, but so many rationalize their losses as they continue to cling to the idea that the MLM has delivered them from the hurts of the world. ",

            "text": "If you guys enjoy my anti-MLM videos, I highly recommend you subscribe to the Antibot channel.  She just released a collab with me on her channel where she exposes me to extremely weird MLM products that I never knew existed.  It was a lot of fun, and I think that you guys will enjoy it as much as I did.  Watch that video right after this one, and make sure to give the Antibot a sub while you're over there.  Okay, back to my video.  Co-opting theology.  This is where stuff gets pretty weird.  I mean, I've told people about this stuff in real life and a lot of people don't really believe me until I show them.  MLMs will take a widely believed piece of theology or religious lore and insert their company or product into them somehow.  This is done to legitimize the MLM in the eyes of religious majorities.  They effectively say to believers, you should or must get involved with our company because our company is a part of your religion.  Essential oil companies are especially notorious for this, so I'll use one of them as an example.  doTERRA Essential Oils is very, very Christian, and they claim that their products have not only existed in more primitive form since creation, but that they are directly endorsed by God because they make appearances in the Bible.  Now, frankincense, myrrh, anointing oils, and other plant extracts are mentioned in the Bible several times.  That's just a fact.  It's what doTERRA does with that fact.  that's troubling.  The company promotes books and lectures about essential oils in the Bible.  In those books and lectures, they claim that essential oils were created by God specifically to be used as medicine.  And of course, if they were made by God for medicinal use, then they must be the most perfect and effective medicine in all existence. ",

            "text": "They might also cite a Bible verse like Revelation 22, 2, which they say upholds herbalism in saying, Here's a clarification I have to make.  It's reasonable to look back on biblical times and acknowledge that plant oils were used for medicine back then.  It was a pre-scientific time and they just used what they had.  What essential oil MLMs do, though, is just beyond that.  They assert that essential oils are a significant part of the Christian story and that using essential oils is important, if not necessary, to proper Christian practice.  It's a roundabout but effective way to claim that being a part of their company is a way to win favor with God himself.  When you combine that idea with the salvation narrative that the antibot just talked about, it motivates some pretty odd behavior among certain MLMers.  There are some distributors who hear their MLM's theological claims and buy into an even more extreme version of the salvation narrative.  The result is total integration of the MLM into a person's religious faith and practice. ",

Honestly though, for anyone who knows how MLMs usually advertise, this shouldn't be surprising.  Above all, MLMs market themselves as a lifestyle to become a part of.  It only makes sense that they would take into account the pre-existing lifestyles of those in their target demographic and tailor their approach to more easily assimilate those people.  MLMs integrate religious rituals and religious belief into themselves not for the sake of morality or spirituality.  They do so for the sake of their only true object of devotion, money.
