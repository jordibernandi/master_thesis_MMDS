            "text": "Hey everyone and welcome back to another video.  Now you guys know I'm not really like a gossipy kind of commentary channel so you wouldn't normally find me talking about like teenage tiktokers or anything.  but in the last couple of weeks a woman named Zoe Laverne has come to my attention and I spent a lot of time deciding kind of whether I want to talk about this topic or not and this whole situation or not.  but in the end it's not really a situation about teenage tiktokers.  it's a situation about a child who was put in a dangerous situation and maybe still is.  so in the end my kind of dislike of gossip was overcome by my need to kind of protect children and that's why I'm talking about this today.  Before we do start and get into any details though I do want to mention that this video may be difficult for some people to listen to.  so if you do feel the need to skip this video I completely understand.  just use your best judgment.  look after yourself and I'll see you in the next one if that's the case.  So for some background, Zoe Laverne is a 19 year old TikToker with apparently 17 million mostly young and impressionable fans and followers on TikTok and around 3 million on Instagram.  That is a hell of a lot of young people looking up to her and listening to her and idolizing her.  It's recently come to the public's attention that she has been romantically and potentially sexually involved with a 13 year old child.  And before we go any further, I want to make it very, very clear that no, it doesn't make it any better that they're both teenagers.  The fact is that Zoe is an adult and the victim in this is a 13-year-old boy, a child.  And it doesn't make it any better that she's a woman and he's a boy.  Adult women grooming and abusing children is just as bad as when men do it.  There's no gender divides here.  There's no, well, it's okay if.  or, you know, it's different if, there's none of that.  An adult abusing a child is never okay, no matter who you are and what genders you are.  So, what exactly happened?  Well, according to a few news articles and videos that I've seen, back in October of this year, Zoe's ex-boyfriend claims that all of his social media accounts were hacked, and a whole bunch of stuff were leaked on some gossipy forums and stuff like that.  I don't really know which ones exactly or their credibility or what really happened here because I'm not really like cool enough to keep up with that kind of stuff but apparently one of these kind of like gossip forums in particular got hold of some messages that had been sent to him by a mutual friend of his and Zoe's and they said, and I quote, I left because of her, meaning Zoe's, interactions with Connor, that's the 13-year-old boy.  They got very intense, and it's something I do not stand by whatsoever, it's paedophilia.  I had told Zoe that if she stopped and minimised contact with him, then she wouldn't have to lose me.  So she changed her story and said she was joking about the things with Connor, but I knew at this point she was lying and they were both lying.  So as I said, the Connor mentioned here is a 13 year old child.  Apparently he started off as a fan of Zoe and then they soon became best friends.  They started spending a lot of time together, especially alone and without any adults around.  And he started featuring in a few of her TikTok videos. ",

            "text": "That I am 19 years old and I know better than to do anything with a 13 year old minor.  My fucking career is set on minors.  I have little kids that look up to me on a daily basis.  Of people saying that I raped one of my best friends that was a supporter of me for three years is unacceptable. ",

            "text": "So if these kind of accusations via text and the fact that they're spending time alone together isn't bad enough, a video then surfaced which shows Zoe, a 19 year old woman, kissing this 13 year old child on the lips.  There are of course two massive levels here on which this is completely and utterly wrong and unacceptable.  The first being the age difference between an adult and a child and the second being the kind of huge power imbalance between creator and fan.  Zoe has all of the power here both in age and influence and Connor is completely unable to consent to anything in this relationship in any way because he's both too young and too kind of impressionable as her fan.  The defense that Zoe and Connor put forward at first was that they were both just best friends and nothing more.  But then, even with like a best friendship or whatever, this kind of age and power difference, it seems unhealthy for Connor.  And like I say, unfair on him.  He would be unable to consent to anything.  Zoe has all the power.  You know, I could understand a kind of like mentor-mentee relationship.  but it's far too uneven for a proper, real friendship.  And really, you have to ask, why are a 19-year-old and a 13-year-old friends in the first place?  What do they really have in common?  After a bit more backlash, Zoe made an apology video in which she claims that she never groomed or raped the 13 year old, her words, but she did admit to the kiss because, I mean, it was on video, she couldn't exactly deny it, right?  However, her excuse was apparently that they just caught feelings for each other, which is a phrase that I absolutely despise. ",

            "text": "Under the age, and it wasn't a good choice, and I realized that when it was happening.  And we talked about it to each other.  It's not as bad as everybody's making it out to be.  Yes, it is bad.  What happened?  The situation that happened is bad.  Yes.  But people are making it out to be something bigger than it is.  And it's not something that Connor and I wanted to be on social media.  I wasn't in the right state of mind.  I was going through a lot and I really just wanted to find happiness and I really just wanted to be happy and Connor was my best friend, still is, even though we can't talk.  He's still my best friend and he made me happy in many different ways and I made him happy in many different ways.  We like both were really close and caught feelings and we didn't really understand like what was going on.  And even though people will say like, well, you're old enough to realize it's wrong.  I just wanted to be happy.  A lot of people are coming after me as I replied to a comment on TikTok saying you can't go to jail for kissing someone.  And that's true.  I did my research and I was, I've already spoken to police about it because I didn't want to put myself in something that wasn't gonna do me good. ",

            "text": "Even if you find yourself having feelings for someone that you shouldn't have, it is always, always, always your choice whether you act on them or not.  If you find yourself having feelings for someone that you shouldn't have, whether that's someone who already has a partner or maybe it's a coworker or a fan where there's this power imbalance or a child, You know, the adult responsible thing to do is to recognize the inappropriateness of it and take a step back and say, I'm going to put an end to this.  I'm stopping it.  No contact.  I'm not going to allow anything to happen.  That's what you have to do.  If like Zoe, you catch feelings for someone you shouldn't, you remove yourself from that situation and you do not allow yourself to act inappropriately because of it.  Most of us will face a time in our lives when we have feelings for someone completely inappropriate.  Maybe for most of us this will just be, you know, feelings for someone else when we have a partner, or feelings for someone else's partner, or feelings for someone at work, something like that.  that's inappropriate but not necessarily dangerous.  And the responsible thing to do is to remove yourself from those situations and not hurt anyone.  But it's even more important.  you do that if we give Zoe the benefit of the doubt here.  And she really did have feelings for this child.  She had all the power and as an adult she should have been responsible enough to recognize the inappropriateness of that and take a step back and not act on abusing a child.  We can potentially understand why she might have had these feelings, but there's no excuse for acting on them.  that is never okay.  We have to remember here that even if Zoe thinks that Connor had feelings for her, he is a child.  His brain, his body have not developed properly to the point where he can consent to anything.  And as the adult.  in that situation, it was entirely Zoe's responsibility to protect him and not take advantage of any feelings he might have.  zoe is acting like an absolute spoiled child here but we have to remember that she's not actually a child.  she is an adult and if she's unable to take responsibility for her actions and keep the children around her safe then she shouldn't be allowed to be around children.  it's as simple as that and she definitely shouldn't be allowed to be an influencer and some kind of role model to these millions of children out there.  it's as simple as that.  if you're a danger to children don't be around children.  Following all of this Zoe and her mother decided to do a little livestream together even though her dad was like protesting in the background but these two apparently as dumb as each other and yeah.  This is where the situation gets ridiculous.  Her mother completely downplayed everything that Zoe did and made out like her daughter was the victim here and I get it.  you know mothers often want to protect their children.  I get that but do you really think she'd have been using the line?  Anybody can reach over and kiss somebody.  They're best friends.  This needs to stop you guys if it had been the other way around and it was an adult man acting this way when Zoe was 13.  Do you really think her mother would have said, oh, they're just best friends, let it go, if an adult had done this to her daughter?  Because I don't.  And in my eyes, it's absolutely no different what the genders are.  Connor's mum seems just as bad at this point although we don't really know because I don't think she said anything publicly.  but Zoe did say in a statement at one point about Connor's mum that she wasn't happy.  obviously but she understood that we're both teenagers and that feelings can be caught.  I'm sorry but this isn't just teenagers being teenagers, kids being kids.  The difference between a 19 and a 13 year old are in many ways as vast as the differences between a 3 and a 9 year old.  One is an adult and the other is a prepubescent child.  Zoe is an independent adult with her own money and a career and probably her own house and god knows what else while Connor is a child who still hasn't even started high school.  He doesn't look or sound like he's even started puberty and he's still completely dependent on his family and those around him.  Zoe completely took advantage of that.  Zoe left the internet for a while but then came back with a TikTok literally mocking the whole situation which I find particularly disgusting.  I'm sorry, but this isn't something you can just mock.  If the public had tried to like counsel her or whatever because she'd said something stupid or dumb or acted like a brat or slipped up with something, I get it, mock yourself and the whole counseling thing to show that you're learning, you're growing, you can make fun of yourself, you're not taking yourself too seriously, I get that.  But when you're accused of grooming and abusing a child, That is not something to mock people for being angry for.  That's not something to mock at all.  It just demonstrates to me that she doesn't understand the seriousness of what she's done.  And if she doesn't understand how serious it is, she's clearly not learned from it.  And therefore she's still probably a danger to many, many children.  Another major issue is that Zoe seems incapable of understanding personal and sexual boundaries in general.  I also came across in researching this reports from her ex-boyfriend who claims that during their relationship there were times when Zoe had, and again I quote, sexually harassed him by kissing him against his will despite him turning his head back and forth to avoid her while covering his lips and asking her to stop.  And there are other reports of her trying to take his trousers off without his consent as well.  Now I get that sometimes signals are hard to read and that sometimes you think you're joking with someone like a boyfriend or whatever and they're not joking and you think they are and it's all kind of confusing.  I get that one-off mistakes can happen like that but clearly this is indicative of the fact that Zoe's issues with personal and sexual boundaries aren't just a one-off mistake.  This actually says to me that this woman is exhibiting a a pattern of behaviour in which she behaves in a completely sexually inappropriate way with men and boys and still hasn't learnt from it or understands really why what she's doing is wrong.  None of this is okay.  It also seems to me that since all this came to light Zoe has not learnt her lesson at all which is why I'm making this video now and still want to talk about this and keep the conversation going.  according to a few articles and things and images that i've seen and um and stuff uh zoe has started posting content again including posting videos of herself in which show her phone case with photos of her and connor kind of like cuddling up together on it and she's posted a number of photos of her and connor together um on social media calling him her happiness and she commented on a live stream of his saying hi Connor I miss you and hope you're doing well.  miss you lots as though she's not a predator continuing to harass her victim.  plus it seems they may both have matching like band touch bracelets that they wear which is like this coupley thing that lets the other know when you're like touching it to kind of like know that oh I'm thinking about you that kind of thing like a mushy coupley thing.  yeah Yeah, basically it's clear that they've not actually broken contact, she's not actually stepped back from this, she's still talking to him.  and if they're doing this in public, what is happening behind the scenes?  She's clearly not learned her lesson at all, she's clearly not taken any steps to do better and improve things and stop abusing an actual child.  I still don't think she understands why her relationship with him was wrong in the first place, and that's not okay.  It's a huge issue, especially when she has such a young and impressionable child audience.  And with that in mind, they're kind of the facts of this, and I kind of want to pass the conversation over to you guys.  Firstly, I kind of want to ask, what do you believe really happened here?  Was it one stupid accidental kiss that was caught on camera, or was that just one of many?  Do you think Zoe was grooming him?  Do you think she abused him?  Do you think it was an inappropriate fall relationship?  What do you actually think happened here and what do you think is continuing to happen?  The next and kind of most important question is what do you think should happen here?  Obviously, I think Connor needs maybe some therapy and some help and to understand what happened.  But for Zoe, what should happen?  Does she need therapy?  Does she need some kind of criminal punishment?  Should she be allowed to continue having her social media platforms, especially when she has such a young and impressionable audience and fan base?  And finally, what do you think we can do to help young people understand that things like this are not okay?  It can be so exciting and, I guess, thrilling, you know, to have someone that you look up to come into your life and if you start off as a fan of theirs and then you get to know them and you become a friend, it's exciting and it's thrilling, but you don't always... realize what a power imbalance there is.  you're not always aware of what the problems are and the dangers are and how you can be abused or taken advantage of in certain ways and i think we need to do more to educate young people about these situations and that it can happen especially as the kind of celebrities that they look up to today are way more accessible than they've ever been.  So I guess my question for you guys is what do you think would be the best education if you are young teenagers yourself?  What sort of things do you think you need to hear?  or how do you think the best way to get these kind of messages across to you would be?  I don't know, I personally have some thoughts but I don't have all the answers.  What I do know is that I don't think someone like Zoe Laverne who is an adult having an inappropriate ongoing relationship with a child should be allowed to have a large platform on social media like TikTok or Instagram or YouTube.  I just, I don't think it's appropriate and I do think that her behaviour warrants her having those platforms taken away from her.  But that's just my opinion.  I'd love to hear what you guys think.  Thank you for watching today.  I'm sorry this has been a little bit more of a serious video than usual, but I felt it was something important and worth talking about and discussing and something that, you know, I care about greatly.  So thank you for watching.  Please let me know your thoughts and I'll see you all again very soon, hopefully with a slightly more upbeat and less sad video. ",
