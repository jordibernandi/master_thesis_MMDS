But obviously, it's not good to say that for some reason.  Men have options.  You can say if you're trash or if you're a decent woman.  TRASH ALREADY!  TRASH!  Or if you're just trash, to be honest.  Like, yeah.  F that.  I'm gonna do one.  I'm off.  And one point to make as well, if I haven't made this point already.  It doesn't matter if a woman is average.  At best, yeah, at best, yeah.  But seriously, it doesn't matter if she's average.  Is she making the most of her averageness?  Is she making the most of what she's got, in other words?  Just because she's average, she would seemingly be a better woman if she was a decent, average woman.  She'd be a better woman than a bitter, average woman.  Because she's just bitter and average, at best.  In other words, because you're average, it doesn't mean you're crap. ",

And when I saw that, my comment to it was, because women ain't shit.  And speaking for myself, I know sometimes I ain't shit.  Because women ain't shit.  And speaking for myself, I know sometimes I ain't shit.  that was beautiful because women ain't like really really really and i know there are really other reasons why men are you know are single you know still playing the field don't really want to settle down and they just have so much other stuff going on.  so they're single.  but i just want to talk about just two of the things that stand out to me just speaking for myself.  one of them again is because women ain't.  i'll talk about that in a little a couple minutes.  but the other reason is because so many of us women are become so independent And I feel like, you know, we are more now on the path of, oh, you know, I have a great job.  I make a lot of money.  Do I even really need a man?  Of course, you know, we need it for other reasons.  It's if you want to have kids and shit.  What?  Other reasons.  It's if you want to have kids and shit.  But we are just so independent now.  Like for me, I haven't, well, I am now.  But prior to a few months ago, I was pretty much single and I've been single since... She's leveled up.  She's leveled up.  So I know that's the reason why, one of the main reasons why, because, you know, we're out here getting it.  No one cares.  And we're not just sitting at home waiting on a man to come and take care of us.  So that's one of the reasons why. ",

I guess to have a long, long, long, long relationship.  Anyway, so one of my guy friends, he was with this girl and they were together for a really, really long time.  And she, initially off the break I didn't care for her too much.  But, you know, that's who he wanted to be with.  So, you know what, sometimes you just got to sit back and let people make their own decisions and live their lives.  So I believe they were together for like seven, eight years.  And this chick, she made him do a whole bunch of stuff that he shouldn't have been doing in my eyes.  And he ended up proposing to her.  So he proposed to her like in, I think it was September.  last year or the year before, I can't remember.  Anywho, he proposed to her.  and then like a few months later, this chick was like, oh, well, I don't want to be with you anymore.  After he completely changed his whole life and how he operated and things like that, he changed everything just to make her happy and satisfy her.  And this chick had the nerve to call off the goddamn engagement.  And like three months later, got engaged to somebody else. ",
