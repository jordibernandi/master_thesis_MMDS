            "text": "So let me give you 10 reasons, specific reasons, why Joe Biden cannot and isn't even interested in uniting this country and bringing Americans together as John Kasich purports.  First one is the Second Amendment.  Joe Biden will water down the Second Amendment.  He can't do away with it.  You need a two-thirds majority in the states to do that, and you're not going to be able to do it.  The Second Amendment can't knock it out, but he will do everything he can and what he's told to do to make it very difficult for Americans to defend themselves with firearms.  He will not crack down on gun-violent crime.  He won't do that at all.  Why?  Because that's mostly minority-driven.  He won't do it.  Second, unfettered abortions.  So Mr.  Biden makes a big deal out of his Roman Catholicism.  Is Joe Biden going to limit abortion in any way?  No, he's not.  He will do nothing to moderate the abortion extremist policies.  That going to bring people together?  Pro-lifers going to go, yeah, that Joe, you know, I'm going to go with him.  All right, so you got Second Amendment, you got abortion.  Third, Increase taxes for everybody.  So Biden will tell all you poor people and working people, I'm not going to increase your taxes.  That's just a lie.  He has to because he's dropping the Medicare age to 60.  Who's going to pay for that?  So all of the taxes on the entitlements are going to have to go up, not just for the wealthy, for everybody.  And the Green New Deal, the trillions and trillions of dollars spent there when he knocks out the fossil fuel industry, All right, that's going to hurt everybody.  So you're going to be paying way more to heat your house and cool your home.  Okay, fourth thing, the destruction of the fossil fuel industry.  You know how many people are going to lose jobs?  All right, in Ohio, in Pennsylvania, because there's not going to be any fossil fuels allowed.  It's 130 degrees in Death Valley, California.  And in the central part of California, it's over 100 degrees every day.  They can't supply the energy needed to air-condition homes in California because they knocked out all the fossil fuel.  And the wind and the solar and the alternatives can't do it.  All right?  So expect that nationwide.  And again, all energy costs for all working and poor people go up.  will go up.  Five, single-payer health care.  The Medicare drop to 60 is just a start.  Government-funded health care.  Biden's not going to oppose that.  He may say, oh, well, I still want insurance around.  But they'll put so many regulations, a Biden administration, on the insurance industry, they'll all get out.  And there won't be anybody left except the government.  They'll strangle.  Is that going to bring people together?  You want to be told what doctor you can go to and what procedures you can have?  You want to wait six months for them?  You want to be like Canada?  You need an operation, a hip replacement, a knee replacement in Canada?  You got to come here.  You can't get him for a year.  Is that what you want?  Not going to bring people together?  Six, cancel culture, me too.  He going to stand up against that?  No, he can't because he's got other people accusing him.  He can't mention it.  He's not going to mess with those people.  They're going to run wild.  BLM, Black Lives Matter, Global Foundation, they're Marxists.  Biden going to bring that up?  Is he going to challenge them?  No.  All right.  Defund the police.  I don't want to defund the police.  I want to divert funds from them.  It's a difference.  All right.  He's going to watch as the nation's law enforcement infrastructure is destroyed, as it has been in Seattle, Portland, Minneapolis, Chicago, New York.  I can go on and on.  Baltimore, Washington, D.C.  Biden going to do anything about that?  No.  In fact, last night at the Democratic Convention wasn't one word about supporting the police.  Not one by anybody.  OK.  Nine.  Rejoin Iran nuke deal.  Biden's there.  Boom.  Go ahead.  Do whatever you want over there.  And here's some money.  Believe me, he'll bring the money to the mullets.  Get more money.  Already gave you $30 billion in cash.  Here's another $10 billion.  And finally, the China detente.  China wants Biden.  Because Trump's, you know, doing a hard deal on trade.  Biden's not going to do that.  Remember his son made millions in China doing... I don't know what he did.  Nobody knows what he did.  Okay, so I got 10 things and I can give you 40.  Any of that going to bring Americans together?  Any of it?  No.  So what's John Casey talking about? ",
