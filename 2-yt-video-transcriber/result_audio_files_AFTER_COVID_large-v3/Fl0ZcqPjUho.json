            "text": "You want this?  Boop.  Good girl.  Before we start, shout out to my brother and sister-in-law who actually sent me some real glasses.  So I'm not just drinking out of a wine glass all my time.  So people can finally stop thinking I'm an alcoholic and realise that I'm actually just a little addicted to caffeine instead.  no but seriously in most of my videos I am either drinking water or juice or lemonade or an energy drink and it turns out most people thought I was drinking wine like constantly every other day.  so all jokes aside this is a little bit of a more serious video today and not one that I actually was gonna talk about.  this isn't anything I planned.  I've not like sat down and written any notes for this so this is different to usual.  I guess I just kind of have a lot of thoughts in my mind about stuff And I just thought I'd turn on the camera and kind of talk to you guys.  Kind of talk through what I'm thinking and where I'm at.  And mostly ask your opinions.  So I don't know how many of you watching are going to be like aware of this because the kind of YouTuber drama commentary stuff isn't what I normally cover.  But I do kind of watch a lot of that content.  And recently there's been a hell of a lot of people talking about Shane Dawson and raking up a lot of stuff from his past.  Now there are people who cover the actual details a lot better than I am and will and can.  So I will link some of those videos down in the description below if you wanna go check them out and get a little bit more background, a little bit more detail.  But basically, it all kind of started with people being mad at him for some stuff involving Jeffree Star and James Charles and them kind of creating some drama and spreading some false allegations about James Charles.  and then from there people started to look into him and his background further and people started raking up all these old video clips and stuff and Shane tried to release this kind of apology.  that was really terrible and wasn't really apologising for anything important or addressing anything important stuff and in it he not only makes a lot of really inappropriate jokes and remarks about children but to children as well and that's where I think I have the main issue.  so what a lot of you guys don't really necessarily realize about me?  um especially because you know a lot of you kind of see me and think i'm either quite serious or quite nice or i don't know.  but i i actually have quite a dark sense of humor and i love like terrible jokes and silly jokes and jokes that can be a little bit risky at times.  But I think the humor often comes from intent, you know, like making a joke to highlight how ridiculous a prejudice is rather than to reinforce a stereotype or making a joke to highlight how messed up something is or making yourself the butt of the joke because it's something you've experienced rather than making fun of another person.  Do you know what I mean?  So on the one hand, I'm definitely not someone to police humor in any way.  I'm not ever going to be one who says, you know, you can't make jokes about this.  You can never make jokes about this.  You can never make jokes about this because I don't know.  I think a lot of the time Not always but a lot of the time it can depend on the individual and the joke and the intent and a lot of things.  Therefore it's not really like generic jokes he made that I'm mad about or uncomfortable with because you know ten years ago the internet was a different place and people felt they had to do different things and say different things to get noticed.  and I mean obviously it worked for Shane and obviously there was an audience for it at the time.  but it's when he kind of directs those jokes at actual people that it gets uncomfortable and wrong, like the clip of him pretending to touch himself to a photo of an 11 year old Willow Smith.  It's wrong, it's disgusting, because even though it's a joke, she's a literal child.  The inappropriate comments he made to his 12-year-old cousin and the way him and his girlfriend at the time spoke to her and the stuff they were speaking about, it was inappropriate and disgusting.  And I just kind of imagine myself as a 12-year-old having someone speak to me like that.  It would have made me so uncomfortable.  I would have felt kind of dirty and gross.  And as much as he tries to play it off with humour, you have to realise that You know, she's a child and it's not appropriate to make her the butt of sexual jokes.  Like, there's a line there and you shouldn't cross it.  You know, sexual jokes are fine.  Jokes about children are fine.  Sexual jokes to a child about that child are not okay and they're never gonna be okay.  and that's what's really really kind of uncomfortable for me and I'm not okay with.  and the thing is like a lot of this stuff was brought up about a year ago and a couple of the clips were kind of floating around the internet and Shane addressed them and said look you know these were jokes they were taken out of context blah blah blah and everyone's like yeah I get it that's fine cool.  and everyone supported him and thought yeah no it is just a joke out of context.  but then these other clips have come out recently and we're like mmm.  No, wait, there is a lot more than just a couple of jokes on a podcast.  You know, there's the stuff he's saying to actual children and minors.  And there's another clip as well of him talking to a teenage fan on Omegle or Omegle, however you want to say it, and asking her to twerk for him, which for me was a little too reminiscent of the Austin Jones situation.  and stuff like that and it just again.  he probably did it for a joke but children teenagers shouldn't be the butt of sexual jokes.  no that's the situation and that's kind of why i'm feeling uncomfortable about it but it has got me kind of thinking about a lot of things and asking a lot of questions.  And I guess I'm kind of just thinking, why are so many of these stories like coming out recently?  Why are so many kind of big content creators and other content creators being kind of exposed for predatory or inappropriate behavior?  like before I've spoken about cancel culture and how I think it's a bad thing and I do still think it is.  but I also feel like there is a difference between you know cancelling someone because they made a mistake once and you're licking your toes again.  but there's a difference between kind of having this big um you know internet wide targeted harassment of someone because they maybe said one tweet you don't like or they said something a bit wrong once or whatever Or they have an opinion you disagree with.  There's that, which I think is bad.  And then there's highlighting a pattern of behavior that is completely inappropriate and harmful in a large content creator and saying, you know, should they be creating for children?  Why aren't they taking responsibility and accountability?  Why were they allowed to get away with this for so long?  And that's the big main thing that I kind of want to bring up because his videos have been watched millions and millions and millions of times.  You have people like Gabbie Hanna deleting her collabs with Shane, and I think she's deleted something like 15 million views from her channel, and that's just her collabs with him.  So Shane Dawson on his channel has literally millions and millions and millions and millions of views.  I don't know how many exactly off the top of my head.  Why has no one called this out before?  Why is it only happening now?  Why, at the time, did no one see it and say, mm, wait, Why are you talking to a 12 year old like that?  Wait, why are you asking a teenager to twerk on webcam for you?  Why was no one calling it out at the time?  And I think it does raise a lot of questions about how our kind of views and culture have shifted.  And I don't think what's changed necessarily is what we find appropriate, but more of our willingness to call it out and get people to face consequences for it.  And I think now people are a lot more aware of what is abusive or dangerous or harmful behaviour.  And people are more able, I guess, to see patterns in that.  And see patterns in people's behaviour over time.  And I do think it's a good thing.  I don't know.  It's very interesting.  Sorry, these are just a lot of my thoughts.  I'm very unorganised.  I'm very rambly.  I don't have a plan with this.  I don't have any answers.  I just kind of... Have thoughts and wanna hear your views on this.  Why do you think so many people are being called out now?  Is it because kind of call out culture's a thing?  Is it because people are more aware of what to look for?  Is it because people are trying to look and trying to take down bigger creators?  Is it because people are more sensitive now?  Is it because people are braver now?  Also, this is gonna sound weird.  I'm not quite sure how to word this.  The thing is, with a lot of the big creators who are being called out, a lot of the time it's because they have done something wrong and they do deserve it.  But... then you get other people who are called out for stuff and they don't necessarily deserve it.  And it's like, how do we distinguish between the two?  How do we distinguish between real mistakes that happened a long time ago and actual patterns of manipulative behavior?  I mean, there are differences, but how do we identify what they are and how do we make sure we're not getting them mixed up?  How do we make sure we're not targeting the wrong people?  I don't know.  I guess as well, it's just kind of got me thinking a lot about my own kind of behaviour online.  I don't think I've... I mean, I've never been predatory towards children, so don't worry about that.  And, you know, I've never been racist, nothing like that.  But... It has got me thinking because I think I mentioned this in my last video.  When I first started YouTube, I felt that to fit in with certain communities, especially like the skeptic community, I had to kind of push my rational, logical side forward and kind of suppress my emotional side a little bit.  And it did feel... Not necessarily like I was putting on an act.  I definitely wasn't being a different person.  I was just only showing one side of me and trying to kind of suppress the other side.  And after a while I was like, well, that's exhausting and silly and it's not who I am.  And if people don't like me for who I am, then whatever.  This isn't the right job for me.  And so I started showing more of the real side of myself and people did like it and it was good.  But... the point i'm trying to make with this is i understand what it's like to try and at least alter parts of your personality a bit because you think it's what the audience wants and in the past i can see why people like shane dawson or i think there's been some stuff with jenna marbles recently but i haven't watched her video and i haven't really followed her in years.  so i'm not going to comment on that because i don't know what's going on.  but not only them but plenty of other people too.  They have done questionable things in the past, but they were rewarded for it with views and money and fame.  I guess to some extent we have to ask how the whole culture of YouTube as a whole has influenced a lot of these behaviours.  because, you know, if Shane Dawson did just make a joke one-off for shock value to be funny and he got the response of views and comments and interactions and money and fame and fans and all this stuff, you know, it would have started a cycle where he tried to get more and more shocking and more and more kind of crazy and out there because it got him more and more attention and money and fame and views and everything.  That's not excusing his behavior, but I do think it helps explain it.  So again, I think it's important to kind of look at the culture we kind of create on YouTube and online as a whole and think about what it's doing and what it's encouraging us to do.  and yeah, I as an individual and as a creator want to make sure I'm not being too influenced by any kind of culture.  Again, at the minute, I do think part of the culture on YouTube is to be quite angry and ranty and call out bad behavior.  I wanna make sure that I don't kind of feel myself getting too influenced by that and getting too negative.  And I do worry sometimes that that's what I do in my content.  You know, the content where I am saying, you know, Gabbie Hanna's poetry is bad.  Lele Pons' book is bad.  This blog is really shocking.  These videos are stupid.  That kind of content is what gets more views.  And that kind of content is what pays my bills.  and yeah sometimes I have to keep reminding myself that kind of for my own sanity and my own mental health to some extent and just for my own enjoyment and fun.  sometimes I need to make the more fun silly videos that don't do as well and don't perform as well just to kind of keep me happy and keep me feeling authentic and real and don't get kind of sucked down that sort of wormhole of anger and hate and ranting.  And I don't know, I don't even know what I'm saying at this point.  This was just a weird random stream of consciousness thought thingy, bleh.  But I genuinely like to hear your thoughts on what you think of the whole Shane Dawson situation.  What you think about differences in the kind of culture that we've created on YouTube now versus what it was like, you know, back in the beginning, 10 years or so ago, even just five years ago, because that 2016 era, that was a whole different thing as well.  god yeah it's interesting.  tell me your thoughts down in the comments below please because i really want this video to be about you and your thoughts and i guess my aim with this was to try and raise more questions than just give you answers.  so um yeah if you want to find out more about the specifics of what shane dillson has done and why people are mad at him go check out the links in the description below and there's some incredible stuff by some incredible content creators down there.  I know one video that I'm definitely going to be putting in is by Stephanie Harlow, who is one of my favourite YouTubers.  She does mostly true crime stuff, but she covered the Shane Dawson stuff.  And as a mother herself, you could really feel her emotion when she was talking about how he spoke to children.  And yeah, I have a lot of respect for her calling him out like that, and I love her content.  So definitely check that one out, plus the others that I'm going to be linking down there.  But for now, thank you for watching.  Please let me know your thoughts.  I appreciate you so much, and I'll see you again very soon.  It has got me kind of... Yes?  You're so cheeky, I love you. ",
