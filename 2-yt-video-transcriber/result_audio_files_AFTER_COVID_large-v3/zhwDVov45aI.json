Joe Biden is president right now.  You can admit that.  No, they stole it.  They're proclaiming it.  But he's not the president.  He's not God's president.  But he's the president of the United States.  No, I don't get it.  Like, I feel like these people legitimately think that, you know, if you don't feel like a person is president, then they're just literally not president.  And that's not how it works.  And that's not even how liberals were acting or behaving when they used to say Donald Trump is not my president.  That was wishful thinking for liberals.  Liberals were saying like, Donald Trump doesn't represent me.  They weren't literally saying Donald Trump currently does not have power in the United States.  You get what I mean?  That is the main difference here.  is that like, I think these people think like, oh, well, if I don't, feel like Donald Trump I mean if I don't feel like Joe Biden's president like he's just not president.  in all fairness liberals literally do the exact same thing.  when Trump won.  no they didn't because Hillary Clinton immediately conceded and 75% of Democrats said that.  no of course Donald Trump is president.  we just don't think he represents our fucking interest.  so you are straight up wrong.  only 75 lol bro that's the hilarity.  you're saying only 75. what the fuck this was immediately after the election and you're When the majority of Republicans don't believe that Joe Biden is president, guys.  No, you're coping right now.  Stop it.  Libtards are the same thing four years ago.  No, I'm not coping.  I'm just telling you what the fucking facts are.  And if you consider that to be coping, then you need a realignment with factually correct information.  I'm coping by telling you what fucking facts are.  Oh, three quarters of Trump voters incorrectly believe he won the election.  But no, where is the one from 2016?  In the United States, 84% accept Trump as a legitimate president.  Out of Clinton voters, 76% of Clinton voters say that Trump is the legitimate president.  There you go.  Do these numbers look the same to you?  52% of Republicans think Trump rightfully won the election.  Just a quarter of Republicans accept the election outcome.  3 in 4 Republicans don't believe Joe Biden won the election legitimately.  84% accept Trump as the legitimate president.  76% of Clinton voters say that Trump is the legitimate president.  Imagine that.  Both sides are the same though, right?  Clinton voters might have all fucking cried that Donald Trump is president.  They might have all said, not my president.  But they still accepted that Donald Trump was legitimately the fucking president.  Whereas, Republicans do not accept that.  Because they do not accept reality. ",

I mean, I do understand where it comes from.  Here's what it is, okay?  And I said this back in 2015.  You can check me on this.  There is video evidence and Huffington Post articles where I talked about, in the aftermath of Donald Trump, stating on, I think it was Chris Matthews' show, that yes, women who get abortions should be punished and everyone like losing their minds over it.  I talked about how Donald Trump is a regular Republican.  Okay.  The difference is Donald Trump doesn't know what the talking points are for the Republicans.  And that's why people love him.  They think that that is authentic.  because he slips the mask off.  He increases the intensity of the dog whistle.  He's not actually a fucking outsider.  The only thing unique about him in comparison to the rest of the Republicans is that he doesn't care enough to mask the true racial agitation behind his words.  His actions in office also prove this reality.  He didn't fucking do anything different than establishment Republicans.  What, you think?  gigantic taxes on the corporations of the wealthy?  Or an agenda overall that was supported by 90% or 95% fucking establishment Republicans?  Like, that was somehow different or unique?  No.  That's why Donald Trump is the Republican Party.  That's precisely why all these people like Jeff Flake, for example, the early anti-Trump Republicans, still ended up voting alongside him on everything.  That's why Mitt Romney can say, oh, well, Mr.  President, I'm so upset with you, and then fucking totally... secretly love the fact that his administration, led by Mitch McConnell, is able to push for Amy COVID Barrett to get appointed to the Supreme Court literally fucking days after, a couple days after people had started voting already for the next president.

So technically they are, while not being communist, still doing more as far as social safety nets.  We do have the fucking concentration camps though.  So that's an area where we're so similar to communist China.  This is the other incredibly contradicting thing where this dude is like, oh, I want environmental symbiosis.
