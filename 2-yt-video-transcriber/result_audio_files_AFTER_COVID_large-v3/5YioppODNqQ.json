That commandment doesn't say thou shalt not kill.  It says thou shalt not murder.  And murder is the defined \u2013 Right.  Well, I'm telling you this because this is what other people told me, right?  Like this isn't something I personally believe.  But they will say that murder is defined as unlawful killing.

That one is one where God actively... aborts a baby if the woman is correct.  yeah.  so there if you this caused that this is one of the ones.  like you rick i read the bible and that's the passage i got to when i was still a christian and just threw the book on the ground and was like God damn it.  God damn it.  So the test for the unfaithful wife, if you leave and you think your wife is cheating on you, you can take her back to the tabernacle.  The priest will take some dirt off the floor and put it in with holy water and say an incantation over it.  And then... the woman drinks it.  if she was unfaithful and got pregnant as a result then she'll miscarry and if she was faithful then she gets to keep the baby.  so in my perspective that was god committing an abortion.  now some people brought it up saying that oh it was her leg to rot so she's she didn't.  based on that interpretation she didn't actually god didn't commit an abortion.  but here's the thing.  it also said that she will be completely infertile for all her days.  now if you are pregnant with a baby And are suddenly rendered infertile.  From that moment to the rest of your days.  Like what happens to the baby.  Right.  The only.  That essentially means that.  You can thwart.  God's.

So we can go on Bible rants all day, but I feel like Rick, you had some more stuff you want to say, but here's a, here's a greater point here because I'm, I'm trying to arm you with things.  People will say, here's another thing.  Okay.  So like, well, you gotta remember when it comes to the killing on the Sunday thing, you know, that's respecting the Sabbath.  Remember Jesus broke the Sabbath.  Right.  He performed a miracle on the Sabbath.  And when he was confronted on that, he said, was the Sabbath not made for man or man made for the Sabbath?  So his whole \u2013 like he \u2013 even Jesus doesn't care about the Sabbath, right?  Christianity like doesn't always cross with Judaism because it's like Jesus \u2013 Christianity is Jesus' take on Judaism.  Like it's not even consistent within itself.  So like you got to be careful with this stuff.  But another thing \u2013 a point I was trying to get to this as well was Christians will also say, well, that's the old covenant and the old covenant doesn't apply anymore.  This is called covenant theology.  And that by Jesus dying on the cross, and this is what I was taught growing up, you know, and doing the whole thing, those old rules we don't have to follow anymore because Jesus' sacrifice was the fulfillment of those rules.  Now, it does beg the question, what rules do we follow now?  And that's going to depend on which Christian you ask. ",

I can't remember.  But one of them talks about a belief he has in like phoenixes, which is interesting, not because of the Bible, but because of a story he heard one time.  And he writes about how the phoenix is a metaphor for God because \u2013 X, Y, and Z, I guess because the phoenix rises, and just like how Jesus rises.  Like, he's writing about this metaphor, but with the assumption that phoenixes are actual real birds you can find in the world.

Well, when he told me the reason why I should probably leave the Pentecostal church, he related it to Cain and Abel and how Cain brought a beautiful offering and how Cain and Abel brought the lamb.  And he compared it to Pentecostals as saying you're doing too much for your religion.  You're bringing God too much.  see we were talking like wow see i grew up.  so i grew up like no you girls i mean i'm not a girl but i'm saying like they would look at the women and if their skirts above their knees it's it's complete.  uh um yeah it just harasses.  almost like you got to put your skirt below you got to do this and and that's when the whole thing finally just started shaking my head like Because I never looked at it that way.

Sounds like he just gave you a metaphor of why you're wrong, which isn't a good way to talk to people or argue your case.  But yeah, lots of problems.  It's bad all day.  We could talk about... all the different stuff.  I do have, we have one more call that shouldn't at the very end that I want to get to.  So I'm going to go ahead and get to them real quick.
