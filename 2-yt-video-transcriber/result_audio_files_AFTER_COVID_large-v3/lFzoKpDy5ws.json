Done.  Nice.  Oh, man.  Terrence K. Williams, if you have been able to avoid during the Trump presidency, the Trump presidency, which is now over, the presidency, Donald Trump is no longer going to be president because he lost the election by millions of votes and a bunch of electoral votes.  I'm just saying he lost it.  and he did not win.  In fact, Trump lost.  Joe Biden won.  Donald Trump did not.  Maybe if you check the title of the stream, you'd know that.  But this is Terrence K. Williams, and if you have avoided him, he is a shitty comedian that's not funny whose entire bank account is funded by grifting, by being one of, you know, you know, you know, you know what I'm saying, right?  You get what I'm saying.  You get what's going on here.  Matt Gill, thanks for the three months.  Do you believe in magic?  I'm hearing ballots for Biden seem to be magically appearing in the middle of the night when we are asleep.  Count every vote.  Blah, blah, blah.  Did we watch this one already?  Did we watch this one already?  Chat?  Are you sure we didn't watch this one already?  Because he was mad the other day, too.  Is he mad today?  TV networks.  See?  You know what I'd rather watch?  This one right here.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Kamala Harris slept her way to the top?  What?  Yikes, buddy.  Yikers.  That is not a thing I've ever heard about her.  Anyway, so apparently Roland S. Martin, who apparently is some guy who I've never seen before, he says mean stuff about Terrence, who's very upset.  he's spaghetti.  Let's watch this.  This should be good.  This should be good.  I think I'm going to like this.  I think I'm going to enjoy this.  So Terrence is screechy, and he is pro-Trump.  Let's see what happens. ",

            "text": "What does that mean?  But you know what?  Y'all wouldn't know that because you listen to the fake news and you don't go out there and seek the truth for yourself.  I mean, the truth can slap you right in the face and you wouldn't know it did.  I mean, you gotta do your research, people.  So this is gonna be held up in courts.  And President Trump will still be your president for four more years.  So if I were y'all, I wouldn't be celebrating so early.  Don't do it to yourself.  Don't hurt yourself like that.  Yeah, because getting yourself all happy is like self-abuse, knowing that President Trump is going to win in the end.  So don't do that to yourself. ",
