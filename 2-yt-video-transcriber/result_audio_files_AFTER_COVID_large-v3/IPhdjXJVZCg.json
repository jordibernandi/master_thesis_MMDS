            "text": "Hey guys, it's me!  Hi!  Oh my god, I'm so nervous.  I don't know why.  Okay, let's get started.  Hey guys, what's up?  Welcome back to my channel.  I'm Kim Cohen and I'm so grateful to have you here.  Welcome!  Okay guys, so after I believe... I don't know, I think it's been four to five months possibly.  I have decided... to return.  Maybe it's less though.  Maybe I'm just being dramatic.  Wait, probably like three or four months.  I think that's what it is.  I'm very, I'm very detoriented.  So that's important to me.  Probably should have checked before, but oh well.  Hi guys.  So, okay.  I wanted to let you guys know that I've missed you guys and I've heard your messages.  I've gotten endless DMs all over my social media platforms and in the comments below asking me to come back on YouTube.  And although it was a hard decision to make, I decided to come back.  However, I will not be covering QAnon related posts.  That is still on my Patreon site.  So if you do not know, that is where my QAnon related content is there.  I create two videos per week.  And if you signed up now, you would be able to watch everything that you have missed.  I am very detail-oriented and the videos on there are a lot longer than they were on here.  Sometimes they're typically like a half an hour long.  Each video, sometimes they're an hour.  With all the information and all the crazy things that happen in the world, I'm still doing that, but just on there.  However, on here, I'm gonna continue my channel in a way that it kind of was prior to all the madness.  In a sense, I've obviously changed a lot.  We all have.  It's been a crazy year to say the least.  But I want to continue making videos that are, you know, that are related to travel, my travel adventure.  I had a birthday like a month ago and I went on my first hot air balloon ride and it was amazing in Las Vegas.  and I have a really cute vlog that I wanna make for you guys.  I've been dying to do this my entire life, so it's very exciting for me.  I also wanna continue to make spiritual and self-growth content for you guys and different things in my lifestyle that I do, whether it's home decor, decorating this place, traveling the world.  There is Peanut.  I'm gonna bring him up here soon to say hi to you guys, because I know you guys always miss Peanut.  you know, self-grow stuff, home decor stuff.  I also started growing like plants.  I have plants all over my house and flowers and vegetables that I've been growing.  So I'm not getting poisoned by the you-know-who.  And yeah, and there's just so much that I want to share with you guys.  And so I want to continue to do that and to inspire you and to enlighten you and to educate you in different ways and in different fields.  I am constantly learning each and every single day since I don't watch normal movies and TV shows anymore because of all the craziness that we have learned.  Hold on.  And there's Peanut.  He just walked by to say hello.  Peanut, say hi.  Hi.  Hi from Peanut.  Love of my life.  Okay.  So I don't watch normal TV shows and movies because of the people that are in them.  Um, so I watch a lot of Gaia.  I'm literally every single day watching a lot of spiritual growth and self growth stuff and All the stuff, really into space right now, the secret space program and different things like that.  So yeah, so I have so much more coming that's exciting that I wanna share with you guys.  So I'm very excited to officially announce that I am back.  Also stay tuned on Thursday.  I have a really big surprise I mean that I've been working on with a bunch of other content creators for a while.  I am so excited about this.  This is literally like the biggest thing I've ever done.  It's like the biggest giveaway I've ever done.  I'm so excited.  So stay tuned for that.  Also as a quick side note for those of you who aren't aware I do have an Instagram account.  I do have 100,000 followers on there and I'm on there daily, constantly in stories.  And I am covering, I'm not covering this topic as much, the Q stuff as much on there, but I am doing updates randomly.  Sometimes I can't help myself anymore.  So if you're not following me on my Instagram account, do so now.  Here is my Instagram name.  I also have a mailing list so if you want to stay up to date with all that I'm doing, I'm going to leave the link below as well because I know some of you guys have so many questions and you want to like stay in touch in case something were to happen to any social media platforms or any of my accounts.  I have a mailing list so you guys can always stay up to date with me and my wild life.  Also super exciting, Florida is the first day to finally say like we're done with the COVID.  Thank you to Sanchez.  So now everything's gonna open up here.  Everything is gonna quote unquote, go back to normal.  And then I get to experience Miami, which literally, if you guys know, I moved here a week and a half before COVID happened.  So I didn't get to do anything.  I've been cooped up in my house.  I have gone to LA and Vegas and Palm Springs twice already during this time.  but obviously not in a normal way.  but now I get to experience all these amazing things in Miami that I haven't been able to do and I want to take you guys on those adventures and hopefully I will be traveling soon and then there will be more and more and more stuff.  but I recently realized that there was so many videos that I filmed that I never created from trips from Egypt, from trips in Israel super funny cool stuff that i've done and i want to bring that to you guys.  so i have so many exciting things i have planned.  um and i can't wait.  i can't wait.  new chapter kids new chapter.  i just had.  um we just had new year's the jewish new year's.  so i get a new chance at 2020 or i'm technically living in 2021 as a jew And yeah, I guess you guys will be seeing more of me.
