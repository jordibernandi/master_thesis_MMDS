            "text": "Raquel Rodriguez, how are you doing?  This is James O'Keefe with Project Veritas.  We have you on tape admitting to coercing voters and bribing voters with gifts.  This is you on video telling someone who to vote for, which is a violation of federal law and state law.  You know, I'm here.  You chose a Republican, not a Democrat, right?  Can I do this?  You can go from wherever you want, but our conversation that we had, you said you were voting for a hater because you were going straight Democrat.  So that way you're voting for the straight Democrat.  Is that what you want to do, correct?  And she's like, well, yeah, you know what, you're right.  And then she changed, I mean, she was voting, but he's clearly voting for John Corden.  Do you think it's okay to change people's votes for them like you did with Ms.  Carter?  Do you think that's acceptable?  I refuse to talk to you right now.  You're on tape doing it.  Do you not see that?  This is what they asked me to say, so no.  Okay, but you actually did that.  I'm done.  I'm leaving.  Well, we're going to leave with you if you're going to leave.  Because you brag.  I don't want to talk.  You bragged that you and your partner go into polling booths with voters and sign an affidavit that you can enforce.  Do you think that's legal?  That's a lie.  You're lying.  I want the biggest candidate.  Everybody's mad.  Which one's that?  Mom.  I got the millionaire.  A millionaire that's like, go do whatever you need to do.  Here's all my credit cards.  I don't take advantage of him.  I tell everybody, I don't work for men.  I work for God.  And he knows what I need.  How many times have you done this before?  Two.  That's not a joke, ma'am.  You're on tape and you've broken the law.  I didn't break any law.  How many times have you done this in the past?  Never.  I love your Michael Kors mask.  Okay.  She was a little shocked, I would say.  Very shocked.  On to the next one. ",
