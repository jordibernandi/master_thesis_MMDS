            "text": "Double checking that this is on, and it's green!  We're good, we are good to go!  Hello everybody, welcome back to the channel!  It has not been too long since we've had a book-related video on the channel, but it has been some time since I did a book-related video.  For a while, I didn't really see myself making creative book-related content.  I was reading, and I was enjoying the things that I was reading, and there were some things that I, you know, occasionally had the idea of talking about in a video.  It just never really happened.  That is until Sarah did a video where she talked about her favorite romance novels and she encouraged me to do the same thing and I thought about it for a long time and now here I am.  You know, here's the thing.  I don't like to be told what to do and a lot of the time if Sarah's like, you should do this, I will not do it.  I can be really petty and I don't mean to be sometimes, but sometimes I do.  This was just one of those times where I was like, you know what?  No, I've read a lot of really good books by a lot of really talented women and they all deserve to be talked about.  Let's just not ignore them maybe?  So today I've got six romance novels and I'm using that term just a little loosely because one of them is technically YA and not actually in like the romance section of a bookstore, but I think it fits into the like YA romance genre.  So I'm I'm counting it in this group because I think it's worthwhile to talk about.  We actually have talked about it on the channel before, but you know what?  I've got things to say!  So the first book that I want to talk about is Brazen and the Beast by Sarah McClain.  This is the second Bare Knuckle Bastards book.  This one is my favorite one so far.  I absolutely adore the first one, which is Wicked and the Wallflower.  Side note, if you're looking for a kind of loosely based on Hades and Persephone historical romance, Wicked and the Wallflower is your go-to.  You can ask pretty much any author that has read Wicked and the Wallflower and they will recommend it for the same reason.  However, Brazen and the Beast, as suggested by the title, is loosely based on Beauty and the Beast, which is only one of the reasons that it's my favorite one so far.  in the series.  Another huge one is the main character, Hattie Sedley, Lady Henrietta Sedley.  She's a plus-size woman and she wants to be a businesswoman and she's just so competent at everything that she does, which sometimes could be a flaw in the book and I don't think that's the case here.  Brazen and the Beast is about Henrietta Sedley basically forcing her own coming-of-age story.  She's well beyond the marrying age of her time and she decides one night on her birthday that she is going to a brothel and she is going to get her life started and the next day she's going to convince her father to let her take over the family business and instead she finds a tied-up man in her care and, as politely as she possibly can, asks him to evacuate so she can, you know, get on with her plans for the night.  It turns out that this man is the brother of the main romantic lead in Wicked and the Wallflower.  His name is Wit, but he goes, his street name is Beast.  Wit is very well known for not talking.  Hattie, on the other hand, is very well known for talking a lot.  However, Wit being the lead in a historical romance, yeah, he's, you know, kind of roguish and runs an illegal business with his family.  So essentially what that means is that Hattie and Wit end up being business rivals until they get sexy.  I don't want to give too much away about this book, but I do absolutely love this.  Hattie gets everything she deserves.  I mean, it's a romance novel, don't they all?  That's why we read romance novels!  So far, although I love Felicity and Devon from the first book, Hattie and Wit are my favorite couple.  I just really Highly recommend.  Fix Her Up by Tessa Bailey is genuinely one of my favorite books.  I've read this book twice.  I barely ever reread books that aren't Pride and Prejudice, and I've read this book twice!  I put it down so I'm not flinging it around, but Fix Her Up is about Georgie Castle and Travis Ford.  Georgie Castle is the youngest Castle sibling.  She, you know, has a kind of a legacy to live up to in their small New York town.  Georgie is not only a virgin, which she doesn't really seem to care about, it's just a fact.  She's also a birthday party clown as a living and she wants to be taken seriously as a person regardless of what she does for a living.  Travis Ford is a former pro baseball player.  He had a really bad injury and now he can't play professionally anymore.  He's also Georgie's brother's best friend because of course he is.  Travis is given an opportunity to audition for a sportscasting job on a very wholesome and family-friendly sports channel.  The only roadblock to that is that he has a really bad reputation of sleeping around and using women for pleasure, essentially.  Just, you know, all around being like a mad boy athlete, I suppose, if that's the trope we're gonna go with.  Travis Ford is a lot more than that, and Georgie Castle knows it because she's known him for over 10 years.  So Georgie and Travis agree to fake date because they basically want the same thing.  They want to be taken seriously in a light that most people that they know don't see them in.  The catch is that Georgie is already head over heels in love with Travis.  She just doesn't really want to admit it to herself.  She is terrified of actually falling in love with him because she doesn't think that he will return those feelings.  And he's kind of terrified of feeling any emotion at all until they start fake dating.  I keep using the air quotes because they're really into each other.  The whole book, their chemistry is unreal.  Georgie is really the reason that I keep coming back to this book, but Travis's transformation from unemotive, very understandingly depressed person into somebody that believes that he's worthy of the people around him?  is magical!  The biggest complaint that I have with this book is that The Eleventh Hour Breakup doesn't read well.  It doesn't ring true.  It feels very much like Tessa Bailey knows what her genre is and has to, like, force certain things to happen because it's a romance novel.  It's all because of Georgie's older brother Steven, who I hate!  He is the worst!  I hate Steven so much!  But that just goes to show you that you can absolutely detest a character in a book and still love the book.  Steven is just the worst, and I live with it.  The next book I listened to the audiobook of, and it's Pride and Prejudice and Other Flavors by Sonali Dev.  Let me tell you.  So from the title, you can probably tell that it's a Pride and Prejudice adaptation, and I have to say, I think it's one of the most inventive Pride and Prejudice adaptations to date.  There are many different ways that you can tell the story of Pride and Prejudice and many different ways that you can interpret those characters and I think Sonali Dev has done the most creative work so far and I am currently writing my own version of Pride and Prejudice.  thing about it is that you can't really place one Pride and Prejudice character with one specific Pride and Prejudice and Other Flavors character except for Wickham.  Wickham is a woman.  Wickham is a white woman with dreads, so that tells you exactly what you need to know.  Trisha Rajah is a doctor.  She has a huge family like the Bennetts.  She has a very complicated relationship with a lot of her siblings, specifically one who is running for political office.  She's also the only surgeon that is willing to and capable of performing a very specific eye surgery on a patient of hers who happens to be, I guess, the stand-in for Georgiana Darcy, because her older brother is DJ, his name is actually Darcy.  But he has a lot of Lizzie's qualities in his personality and in the fact that he comes from a poorer family than Trisha does.  kind of difficult to suss out which one is supposed to be Lizzie and which one is supposed to be Darcy, and I liked that about it.  I liked that Sonali Dev wasn't afraid to take characteristics of both of them and assign them to each character of hers, which I don't think any other adaptation of Pride and Prejudice has ever done that, and I just liked it.  It was refreshing.  I guess it's pretty important to note that DJ is British-Nigerian, I believe, and Trisha's family is from India.  I just also just really loved the story.  So like I said, Trisha is preparing to do an operation on DJ's younger sister, who's an artist.  However, if she performs the surgery, DJ's sister becomes blind and can't do art anymore unless, you know, she adapts and learns how to do other forms of art.  So there's a lot of back and forth between DJ and his younger sister and DJ and Trisha.  DJ is also a chef, so he does a lot of work for her family throughout the book.  Trisha loves to eat!  It's amazing!  And just like the family dynamics work a lot with the Pride and Prejudice adaptation, it's a really good book.  I screamed about a million times because there were just things that I recognized from the original that were used in such a new and unique way that honestly made me feel really jealous because again, I'm trying to write a Pride and Prejudice adaptation and I don't think mine is gonna be anywhere near this level.  So if you're a fan of Pride and Prejudice adaptations or if you're just looking for a more diverse read, Pride and Prejudice and Other Flavors is probably a really good book for you.  To get into the book that we've already discussed on this channel and the one that is technically a YA book and not in the romance section, I love Geekerella.  Is anybody surprised?  The name gives it away.  It's Cinderella, but it's modern and it revolves around a sci-fi convention.  That's pretty much it.  you gotta know.  It's told in two perspectives, so you've got Danielle, or Elle, who is our Cinderella character, and Darian, who is our Prince character.  Darian is an actor, he's well known for being on a soap opera, but he's just been cast in a reboot of Starfield, which, to put it lightly, is a Star Trek, Star Wars kind of mishmash that also exists in the universe with Star Trek and Star Wars.  He's been cast as Prince Carmendor, the lead of the entire movie.  He's really nervous because he's a big nerd for Starfield, and the rest of the internet doesn't want him to play Carmendor.  They don't think that he'll be a good Carmendor because they only see him as a soap opera actor, which is really unfair.  I feel it's especially unfair because Darian very much cares about Starfield, and nobody seems to believe that.  Except for Danielle, and that's really only over text.  When she doesn't know that she's talking to Darian, she thinks that Darian is a bad choice for Carmendor.  She just thinks she's talking to another fan of Starfield over text, And she really, really likes him.  And he really, really likes her.  It's been a while since I read it, but I think they plan to meet up at the convention.  Lots of stuff from, like, Cinderella ensues.  There's a dog.  There's a lesbian that drives a vegan pumpkin food truck.  I genuinely cried over the end of Geekerella.  It is heart-wrenching.  So good.  So good.  There's also a second book.  It's The Princess and the Fangirl.  That one was a little bit slower to get into.  However, there's a Carrie Fisher stand-in in that one that made me cry.  Oh, did she make me cry.  Ashley Poston is coming for my emotions every time.  There's a Beauty and the Beast one coming out soon.  I'm not prepared.  If you're a fan of Cinderella or if you're a fan of stories that take place at conventions, Geekerella's for you.  The next one that I read was also an audiobook.  It's called The Plus One by Sarah Archer.  It's a very weird romance book.  I saw it when I used to work in a bookstore and I picked it up once and was like, this seems bizarre.  And then I just found it on my library app.  The Plus One is about this woman, Kelly, who has a lot of social anxiety and she doesn't really like to go on dates.  Like, you know, she doesn't want to be a serial dater and she's also devoted to her job.  Kelly's younger sister is getting married, and in true romance and fanfic fashion, her mother is pestering her about why she's still single, why she won't go on any dates, and why she doesn't have a date to the wedding.  So, Kelly, a robotics engineer, decides to use her work for her own gain and literally makes herself a robot boyfriend.  His name is Ethan.  His brain is connected to the internet.  He apparently learns and like can feel things or he's like programmed to think that he feels things, the lines drawn between what Ethan can do for himself and what Kelly has to give Ethan the ability to do, they're very blurred.  Given that Ethan is not a real human being, I am not sure that we can apply the same standards to their relationship that we would if Ethan was.  a real human being.  Throughout the book, Ethan really seems to want to be with Kelly, but again, Kelly actually kind of deals with this conflict of, is that really Ethan's personality, or is that something that I've programmed into Ethan without recognizing it?  Ethan is very nice.  He really seems to care about her, and he's very personable with her family and friends, pretty much all because Kelly made him that way.  Kelly learns, eventually, that she created Ethan.  Everything that she and Ethan had came from her own mind and her own hands and her own hard work.  So... none of it was really real.  By the end of the book, she recognizes that the things that she was doing with Ethan, the reason that she even had Ethan in the first place, it wasn't real, and it wasn't real human connection, and it wasn't going to be able to last forever the way that she wanted it to, and she had to deal with that.  It's just a very weird book if you're into that kind of stuff.  Give it a try.  I don't think it's a bad book.  I just think it's very weird.  And to close the video out, here is one of my absolute favorite books in the entire world, possibly till the end of time.  It's Red, White, and Royal Blue by Casey McQuiston.  I would just like to take this moment to thank Taylor Simons, our friend.  We've talked about her book.  She's been on the channel before.  She recommended this book to me.  In fact, she yelled at me to read it.  So I did.  I haven't looked back since.  Red, White, and Royal Blue is about the son of the first female president of the United States of America and the youngest Prince of Wales.  Alex and Henry are my boys.  I absolutely adore them.  What can I say about this?  It's so long, so much happens, but it's so beautiful and worth it and I love it.  So Henry and Alex both think that the other one hates the other and it's just not really true.  They just kind of annoy one another whenever they have to be in the same room.  into a lot of trouble at Henry's brother's wedding.  And both of their PR teams and security teams are like, hey, You're gonna have to be his friend now to make this look like just a ha-ha funny coincidence kind of thing.  And they get locked in a closet together, because of course they do.  Welcome to romance.  And they find out that they both really like Star Wars, and that's kind of where their true friendship blossoms with Star Wars.  There's so much that happens in that book, and I don't want to spoil any of it other than what I may have already spoiled, but I don't think I've given away too much.  There's like two characters in that entire book that I wouldn't absolutely die for, I can't say too much because I really genuinely want people to read that book.  If you're worried about Henry being the Prince of Wales and like imperialism or stuff, that's dealt with.  Oh, is that dealt with?  I think I'm gonna stop yelling about this book because A it's after 10 o'clock at night, my parents are both asleep, and B I think I've said everything that I need to say about it to possibly sell it to somebody because it is just... That good.  Please, please consider reading it.  Please, for the love of God, please consider reading Red, White, and Royal Blue.  If you've read any of these books, please let me know in the comments below.  If you have any other good romance recommendations, let me know as well.  I'm always up for new recommendations, now that I have sufficiently yelled over six books in the middle of the night.  Thank you so much for watching this video.
