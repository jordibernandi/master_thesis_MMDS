Number one, farmers by dealing with you being able to put land in land banks and you get paid to do that to provide for more open space and provide for the ability of you to be able to be in a position that we are going to pay you for planting certain crops that in fact absorb carbon from the air.  that's part of what the plan relates to in terms of agriculture and the environment.  But as it relates to, if you're talking about regulation that relates to fertilizer and water tables, that's a different thing.  In the United States, in my state of Delaware, we have a $4 billion industry.  Chickens.  chicken and poultry and all the manure, quite frankly, that is a consequence of chickens.  And so it's polluting the Chesapeake Bay.  What we found out, we've invested a lot of money, we found out you can pelletize this and take out take out the methane.  So you're in a position where you can use that fertilizer without the damage that was being done before.  The same way with horse manure and cow manure and pig manure.  And we can create thousands of jobs in rural America as a consequence of setting up these small industries within communities. ",
