But we thought if we told the entire group of our subscribers and listeners, our entire family here, the wisdom of the tribe will be much better than anything that we could do on our own.  So can you guys please help us out?  Help us find our new place.  And here's some of the priorities that we're looking for along the way. ",

And because we're both Lyme survivors and we've suffered for the last several years through tick-borne illnesses, we were kind of tick phobic and so a state that has low incident of tick borne illnesses would be great.  and so if you guys have any other things we had on our list is that uh let's see we said low regulation.
