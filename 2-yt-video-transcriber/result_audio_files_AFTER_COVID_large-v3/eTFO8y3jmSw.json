There are atheists who do not believe in evolution, and there are Christians who do, though certainly there will be a higher percentage of Christians who do believe in evolution than atheists who do not.  I think the reason these two concepts get so interconnected is because the atheists who are the loudest and most active also tend to talk about evolution a lot.  The reason for this, though, is that they are often responding to the pushback against evolution that comes in the form of young earth creationism, which is not a position that is held by most Christians, but they are the ones being the loudest about it.  Think of it this way.  Dr.  Mary Schweitzer is a devout Christian paleontologist, and she accepts the theory of evolution.  I am a Christian.  I love the Lord.  My God has gotten so much bigger the bigger I study science.  Do you think she would appreciate it if I were to ask an atheist speaker to give a debunking of young earth creationism on the grounds that that's all that Christians have?

Now before I get crucified in the comments for lending credibility to the creationist idea of micro and macro evolution, let me just point out that these phrases were originally scientific in nature but were hijacked by creationists to explain away the fact that evolution obviously and undeniably does happen, and is easy to see within a species.  The term was originally coined by Russian entomologist Yuri Filipchenko in his 1927 book whose German name I'm not even going to try to pronounce, but which translates into English as Variability and Variation.  They were coined in a time when evolution was still not well understood, and I would tend to agree that it's time for the terms to retire from the scientific community, as we now have a better understanding and we know that there really is no different mechanism between them.  It's simply a matter of scale.  But the fact remains that they are still valid scientific terms that are misused by creationists.  Because the mechanisms are the same, it would be like saying a trip to the grocery store down the road is possible, but you can't possibly drive all the way across the country.  The same car works in the same way to get you both to the store and to the other side of the country, it just takes longer to drive further. ",

When you eat, your body breaks down the molecules in the food in order to incorporate them into your body.  You are quite literally made of material that at one point was never anything even close to a human being.  In fact, because your body is made of about 60% water, and how the water cycle works, and how long the dinosaurs existed, that means that essentially all of the water in your body was, at one point or another, dinosaur pee.  You are literally mostly made out of molecules that were once dino pee.  I think I'm a bit off topic though.  My point is that molecules become human beings on a regular basis, and we know the chemical reactions that would have been required to turn organic molecules into basic cells, and once you have basic replicating cells, natural selection goes to work on them.  Essentially it boils down to the fact that we know all of the processes required for abiogenesis and evolution to work are possible in a natural environment, even if we haven't nailed down all of the specifics.

Why not just present the actual evidence both for and against and let people come to their own conclusions?  I know this is just a quick Q&A session, but it's possible to give an unbiased rundown of both positions.  For instance, evolution is the idea that small changes can add up over time and result in big changes, which is what resulted in the diversity of life that we see today.  That's evolution in an oversimplified nutshell.  Young Earth creationism, in a nutshell, is the idea that Earth is about six to ten thousand years old and the diversity of life that we see today was created by God.  I'd say those are both unbiased explanations.  Now, to add my bias back into the mix, it boils down to the idea that the kinds of changes we can observe happening today have the ability to accumulate, which makes sense or magic. ",

Geologically speaking, with the 4.5 billion years of the Earth's existence in mind, that's pretty quick.  But to call it instantaneous makes it sound like everything just popped up all at once, which is completely false.  Let's put this into terms that we can actually visualize.  To drive from Halifax, Nova Scotia to Vancouver, British Columbia is a trip of 5,927 kilometers for a travel time of about 60 hours.  On your way there, you stop by in Gough's, Nova Scotia to pick up a friend.  Gough's is about 35 kilometers away from Halifax for about a half hour drive.  Now in terms of the entire trip, this is a tiny distance, so if you picked your friend up a half hour in, you could say that you picked them up right at the beginning of the trip, or that you started the trip with them.  And when looking at the whole trip, you'd be right, that was essentially the start.  But when you consider the fact that we have seen speciation events occur within a single human lifetime, then to think that a whole bunch of speciation events couldn't possibly have happened over 25 million years is a joke!  On our road trip, a single human lifespan of 79 years wouldn't even get us from the house to the car.  Never mind the car, it wouldn't even get us out of bed.  Forget getting out of bed, it wouldn't even get us to rolling over in the right direction to get out of bed.  So what you are suggesting by making it sound like they all appeared instantly is that something that takes less time than rolling over to get out of bed couldn't possibly have happened a bunch of times in the time it takes to drive 35 kilometers.

In fact, I'm not sure exactly which passage Darwin's doubt is referring to, but one thing that Darwin did find puzzling was the lack of Precambrian fossils.  But because of the nature of Precambrian organisms, it turns out that their fossils are actually relatively abundant, even considering their lack of hard body parts.  It just takes a microscope to see them because they were so tiny, so as it turns out, they're all over the place.  And since there are baleen whales and toothed whales, it was predicted that a fossil would be found with both baleen and teeth.  It was.  Lanocetus dentocranatus.  Darwin himself, by observing a species of orchid native to Madagascar, predicted that there would be a species of moth with a proboscis just longer than 30 cm as a result of an evolutionary arms race between the orchids and the moths.  As moths developed longer proboscises, they would be able to suck nectar from the orchids without getting pollen on them, and so would not be pollinating the orchids.  This made it easier for the moth to get food, but at the detriment of the orchid, so the orchids with longer spurs to make it harder for the moths to get pollen were more successful at reproducing, which in turn pressured the moths to develop longer proboscises, etc.  So in 1962, Darwin first predicted the existence of a large moth with a 30 cm proboscis.  In 1867, Alfred Russell Wallace narrowed down the prediction, stating that it would not just be any old moth, but a subspecies of the African sphinx moth, or Xanthopan morgani.  In 1902, the Xanthopan morgani predicta was discovered in Madagascar as predicted, hence its name.  My point is, there are several predictions that have been made because of the theory of evolution, which have later been confirmed. ",

A tiny bit of googling will yield incredible results as to the number of transitional fossils that we find.  And it bears mentioning that depending on how you look at it, every organism that has ever lived was transitional, as evolution is a continuing process with no end goals in mind.  All the examples I gave were of the transitions of some major groups, but it doesn't end at the end of that particular transition.

It has been said that if you so much as remove one part from a mouse trap, it will no longer function, and so is irreducibly complex.

And here I don't mean going backward like a loss of function mutation like how snakes lost their limbs.  I'm talking about reverting to a previous state to try out a different design.  Once a working system develops, it is far easier for further mutations to refine an already present system than to discard it and start fresh.  So once the spinal cord became the dominant body plan for the chordates, it became incredibly unlikely that a series of mutations would occur that would eliminate the spinal cord and also replace it with something superior fast enough that these organisms wouldn't simply be out-competed by their spinal corded cousins.  This is how you end up with silly things like a 4.5 meter long laryngeal nerve in a giraffe, because through the evolution of the neck, the nerve became trapped under the aortic arch.  This is silly enough in humans, where it has to go from our brain down through our chest and then back up almost all the way to the brain again, but it makes the same detour in a giraffe, which is just ludicrous.  But evolution isn't a thinking process.  There was no selective pressure to redesign the system.  It works well enough, so it continued.  Natural selection isn't really the survival of the fittest.  It's more the survival of the good enough. ",
