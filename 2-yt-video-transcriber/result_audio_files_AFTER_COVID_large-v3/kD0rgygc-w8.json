By any measure, what the Obama-Biden administration did in 2016 and 2017 makes everything Richard Nixon even contemplated pale in comparison.  And Richard Nixon rightfully faced impeachment and ultimately resigned as a consequence of his misconduct. ",

We know that on January 4, 2017, the FBI concluded in the document that has just been released that General Michael Flynn was, quote, no longer a viable candidate to be part of this larger case.  Their investigation did not yield any information on which to predicate further investigative efforts.  The FBI is closing this investigation.  That was January 4, 2017.  The next day, James Comey, the director of the FBI, is sitting in the Oval Office.  with Barack Obama, with Joe Biden, and James Comey, according to a memo from Susan Rice, one of the most remarkable CYA memos written in Washington, written on her last day in office, an email to herself saying, by the way, this investigation into the National Security Advisor coming in to the new office, the president has said, do it, quote, by the book.  She says by the book three times.  James Comey tells the president, we're investigating Michael Flynn by the book.  Well, unless the book is Richard Nixon's Watergate, the day before the FBI said they were closing the investigation, and there's James Comey telling Barack Obama, we're going after General Flynn, a decorated three-star general, the incoming national security advisor to the president.  With Joe Biden sitting right there nodding along, Joe Biden himself personally unmasks Michael Flynn's name.  That's the world you came into, Mr.  Rosenstein.  That's the Department of Justice you came into.  Where it had been corrupted and politicized.  You've read the Inspector General report, Mr.  Rosenstein. ",
