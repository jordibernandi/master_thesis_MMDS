            "text": "What you just heard was an interview by phone that Donald Trump did with Sean Hannity.  And they had to stop twice because Trump's voice kept going hoarse.  Now, Trump is set to do a rally in Florida Saturday.  He says he's feeling good, and then his voice goes hoarse and gave out on him.  So they had to stop that phone interview twice, y'all, and restart because Trump is on there talking about how great he is, how cured he is.  We heard what he said over the last few days.  He think he's immune to COVID and all this nonsense.  that is not true.  And they're saying people at the White House says he looks weak.  He looks tired and he does look sick.  But when he jumps in front of the camera, he knows how to put on a performance and get this.  He's supposed to do an evaluation with a Fox News doctor to prove that he's healthy.  That doesn't prove anything.  You're just going to sit and rehearse with that Fox News doctor and then y'all going to go on the air.  Y'all not fooling no damn body.  But let me get into this story that came out from Raw Story, October 8th.  2020, President Donald Trump announced plans to resume campaign rallies.  Now, you know, the debate has been canceled.  Number one, Joe Biden will not get on the stage with Donald Trump unless he tests negative, you know, and prove that he's no longer infected with COVID.  And Trump is just avoiding that question about him being negative, which tells me he's not negative, he's still positive.  And they had offered a virtual rally.  I mean, not rally, I'm sorry, debate.  And Donald Trump refused to do a virtual debate.  He wants to do in-person while he's still infected.  So the debate is not gonna happen.  President Donald Trump announced plans to resume campaign rallies despite his COVID-19 infection, which he shouldn't be doing as long as he's positive, but you know how this dude is.  So watching the news coverage and angry at the state of the race, Mr.  Trump have been imploring aides to let him resume campaign rallies as soon as this weekend, which now could be possible.  He showed up again.  in the Oval Office on Thursday, despite efforts to get him to remain in the residence until he was more fully recovered.  So this dude don't listen to no one.  You know, Mary Trump, his niece said that's how they were raised.  They were raised to believe being sick was a weakness.  And this is something that the father passed on to the children.  So they think if they're sick, they're weak.  That doesn't even make any common sense.  But let's go ahead.  I mean, let's move on.  That's really silly.  The New York Times reported Thursday around the White House and inside the Trump campaign, some advisors are worried, others looking worried.  at the calendar and arguing that there is still a lot of time left while they realize there are few, if any, opportunities to change the trajectory of the race.  That would be especially true without next week's debate.  During Thursday night appearance on Fox News, Trump refused to tell Hannity if he had a negative coronavirus test, which he don't have that.  Because, see, if you had a negative coronavirus test, why would you hide that?  That would be something you would think he would gladly tell people.  So he doesn't have it.  He's still positive.  But Trump did announce he hopes to resume campaign rallies regardless of his infection status, saying he was hoping for a Saturday rally in Florida and a Sunday rally in Pennsylvania.  Y'all got to be crazy to let this man come and infect all kinds of people over some damn rally.  That's not a good enough reason to make people sick.  But Florida, I can see it happening because DeSantis is Trump's lapdog.  You know, Pennsylvania, I don't know, those knuckleheads, they may be dumb enough to do it too.  So on Twitter, someone had posted, you know, the phone interview.  And every time Hannity was trying to ask Trump about you know, being negative, he just ignored it and kept on ranting.  See if I can get this to play for y'all. ",
