            "text": "Hey, what's going on?  My name is Nate.  And, you know, I'm one of those people who have a love-hate relationship with the media.  Sometimes they do good things, sometimes they do bad things.  But in the case of the women's U.S.  national team and their lawsuit for equal pay, the media, the media, And not only have they misled you a little bit, I think this is one of the worst times that the media has thrown up horrible, horrible information, making you sympathetic to one side.  But I believe when you hear the facts, you're going to understand why the women's lawsuit, the U.S.  women's soccer team's lawsuit was thrown out.  And you are probably going to agree that it should have been thrown out.  All right, let's just start this off right.  If you are new here, my name is Nate.  I'm an attorney, lawyer, YouTuber.  I do videos about multiple different topics, usually with a nice little type of law flair to it.  So I call my show hood law because it is a law with like a nice little urban twist to it.

You can become a member of this channel and help support me in what I do.  I would really appreciate it and it helps me keep the lights on over here.  So if you're interested and if you have the funds, I think it's two, $3 a month, grab a channel membership and you'll see all the nice little perks that come with it.  I would appreciate it.  But now onto the story.  Now, as you know, I used to be a law school lecturer, right?  I was a prosecutor and I used to teach at a law school.  I had students.  I gave grades, the whole shenanigans.  The way I used to always tell my students to break down a case is start with the facts because the facts are going to let you know what the issues are.  It's going to let you know what the law is.  So we will start with the facts.  First, from the period that the lawsuit covers, 2015 to 2019, the U.S.  Women's National Team was paid approximately $24 million.  That averaged about $220,000 per game, and they played 111 games.  In contrast, the Men's National Team was paid about $18 million, and that averaged about $212,000 per game.  They played 87 games.  Now, the court says, based on this evidence, it appears that the women's national team did not make more money than the men's national team solely because they played more games.  Rather, the women's national team both played more games and made more money per game.  Now, the first fact that we have to understand is that U.S.  soccer negotiates with the women's team and the men's team separately for contracts.  So it's not one contract for all.  It's a separate negotiation between the women's team and a separate negotiation between the men's team.  Now, in May 2016, U.S.  Soccer offered the women's national team the same contract as they did the men's.  And the women's team rejected it.  So U.S.  Soccer said, let's pay the men and the women identically.  And that offer was rejected by the women's team.  So this isn't about equal pay because that was offered.  It was offered in 2016, three years before they brought this lawsuit.  So they were offered equal pay.  They rejected it.  Now, why did they reject it?  Well, the court says they preferred an agreement involving some elements of guaranteed compensation.  So they rejected the men's deal and said, we'd rather a deal that give us some guaranteed compensation.  Now, this is a direct quote from the opinion.  In reality, the men's national team and the women's national team bargained for different agreements which reflected their different preferences.  And that the women's national team explicitly rejected the terms they are now seeking to retroactively impose on themselves.  So they were offered the men's contract.  They said, we'll pay you like the men.  They rejected it.  and now they're coming to the court saying, we want the men's deal.  So it's going to lead you to say, well, what are the agreements?  What are the differences?  and how are they the same?  Let's look at the men's deal.  The men had a play to pay agreement.  Now what this means is that each player is not compensated unless they participate in a training camp and they have to play in the games.  Now the men's collective bargaining agreement had no obligation of any matches, any amount of members on the team, whether they'll play in a tournament, it had no obligations to US soccer to do anything or hold any events.  Now for the men's national team players don't get any salary.  They only get performance bonuses based on performance.  How does that work?  Well, if they have a game which is known as a friendly, these are competitions just, you know, hey, let's just have a friendly match.  If they win, they get $17,000 per player.  If they tie, they get up to $8,000 per player.  And if they lose, each player gets five grand.  Again, that's it.  You play, you win, you get paid, you lose, you get nothing.  Now, let's say the men's team makes it to the World Cup, which they didn't last time, but let's say they made it to the World Cup.  Then each player on the men's team will get a $68,000 bonus.  Now, if they just qualify and make it to the qualifying rounds, US Soccer will give the team $2.5 million for each player to split evenly.  If they make it to the semifinals, that amount turns into $5.5 million for each player to split evenly.  And if they win the World Cup, which the U.S.  hasn't done in a while, they'll split $9 million equally between the whole team.  Now, it is important to note here, there is no guaranteed compensation.  If a man on the men's team does not play in a game, not going to get compensated.  If a man on the US team is cut early from the team, he will not get compensated.  You play, you get paid.  You don't play, you don't get paid.  Simple enough.  That is the men's collective bargaining agreement.  So what about the women?  What about the women's national team?  Now, mind you, they were offered this same deal that the men got and rejected it.  They said, we don't want that.  So what did they get instead?  Well, first off, US soccer must have at a minimum 20 contracted players on the women's national team.  And each one of those 20 players must have a salary of $100,000.  So now they are salaried employees.  They're making $100,000.  So 20 women, $100,000 each.  Now, if any of those players play in the National Women's Soccer League, That team has to have 11 players.  And if you are a tier one player, you receive a base salary of $67,000.  If you're a tier two player, you receive a base salary of $62,000.  So you have the women's national team.  If you make that team, you get $100,000 salary.  Boom, you're good.  And if you don't, if you make that team and you make the women's national soccer league, you go to that soccer league, you get $67,000 if you're a top tier player.  And if you're a lower tier player, you get $62,000.  Now, let's talk about friendlies.  They're bonuses that they get for wins.  Now, this structure is identical to the men's structure, except obviously it's gonna be less money because the women have gotten paid already.  They get $100,000 salaries, whereas the men, if you don't play, you get nothing.  Now, for friendlies, women can make up to $8,500 for a win, and they don't make any money, any bonus for any ties or any losses.  So they only make money if they win.  And again, that could be up to 8,500 bucks.  Now in the World Cup, that changes a little bit. ",
