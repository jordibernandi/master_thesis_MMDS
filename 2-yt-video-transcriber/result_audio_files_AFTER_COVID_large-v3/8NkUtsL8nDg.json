But these are so incredibly vague that there are so many possible things that you could look at and say, hey, you know what?  This technically fits Jeremiah, right?  right but there's it's not specific enough and saying hey okay if you go out there in in in the universe you're going to find this and this is going to be your explicit proof of god.  because they say a lot of things about the universe.  uh that turned out not to be true.  like the the the the permanent um and uh having pillars that hold up the earth there's a lot of stuff in there that we can just throw out because we've already figured out that this isn't the way the universe is actually set up.  okay.  so I want to know why it's convincing that all this metaphorical stuff that is so vague and not specific is convincing enough and why it should be convincing enough to us that whoever wrote the Bible knew what they were talking about and then that it validates all the other stuff that we may not know yet.

What is this predicting for us?  Because if all we have is something that explains information from the past and kind of ties it up very neatly into 66 books, that's not very convincing.  All that's saying to me is that there's some way to put different words on this.  that matches up very neatly with the words that we already have on the page.  This is what we in the fanfiction industry like to call retconning, okay?  So what I would like to see is some sort of proof that this is not retcon, and it's not just taking what we have discovered in science and finding a way to still make it compatible with biblical beliefs.  So the way that I would think about that is, David, what's next?  What is something in the Bible that we can use to make a scientific discovery that we will later find out to be true in explicit enough terms that we know it's not fake? ",
