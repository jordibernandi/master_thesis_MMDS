We had the chance to meet survivors, and they told us their stories, and yeah, you can't forget it.  They don't whitewash it.  They don't pretend it didn't happen.  They don't say, hey, that was before my time.  What's this got to do with me?  I didn't kill anyone. ",

And they can't forget, because outside of their homes, on the sidewalk, are little engravings that remind them of the name of the Jewish family that used to live in this house, but was taken away and killed.  Local artists have installed around town the Jews forbidden signs from the 1930s.  To remind today's generation that to be German isn't just about Beethoven and Bach, but also about genocide and evil.  What would our signs look like?  What would our classes teach if we wanted to teach our young the whole story of what it means to be American?  What reparations would we make?  Have we truly changed?  Until 2015, the United States never had a museum of slavery.  Why do we hide from our sins?  The first step to recovery, the first step to being a better person or a better country, is to be able to just stand up and honestly say who and what you are.  I am an American.  I live in a great country that was born in genocide and built on the backs of slaves.  If there's one thing we should steal from the Germans, it's the idea that if you acknowledge your dark side and make amends for it, you can free yourself to be a better people and to do well by others.  If they can do it, surely we can. ",
