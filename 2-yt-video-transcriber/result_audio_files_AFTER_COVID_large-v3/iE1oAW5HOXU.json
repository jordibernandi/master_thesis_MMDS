They've done their research.  They've read up on the latest and greatest information.  Adam Ragusea just seethes that type of energy.  I cannot stand it.  And recently, he did a video trash talking raw food diets, paleo diets, and keto diets, basically appealing to authority, talking to experts.  and really what the average person wants to hear.  And, you know, his audience is a bunch of normies, but this video was so painfully incorrect that, I mean, not painfully incorrect, not one thing he said was correct.  So let's take a look before I lose my mind. ",

We will get back to that.  I'd call raw and paleo the stupidest because they are predicated on some very suspect notions of how our bodies work and how they evolved to work that way.  We'll start with the raw diet.  Certainly, you can live a long, healthy life eating all kinds of diets, and any diet that restricts refined carbohydrates and other processed foods will probably do some good for people like me living overfed lives.  So whatever works for you, works.  Just don't let anyone tell you that a raw foods diet is more natural, because we humans have been cooking our food since before we were homo sapiens.  In fact, cooking might be part of why we are homo sapiens.  What I just said is known in the field of anthropology as the cooking hypothesis.  And while the lifestyles of our Paleolithic ancestors may differ quite a bit from our own, the reasons why cooking was advantageous to them still apply to us.  Scholars believe the human ancestor Homo erectus started eating meat about 2.5 million years ago.  They invented cooking about a million years ago.  Cooking became a widespread practice around 250,000 years ago, and that's about when the first anatomically modern humans appeared, the first Homo sapiens.  These are all interrelated events, or so goes the hypothesis. ",

And notice how he said, we started cooking food as if he was implying that we were only eating cooked food from that point on, which is absolutely not true.

Unlike Goaty there, I don't need to spend literally my entire day chewing my cud, and my body hardware doesn't need to be monopolized with the constant work of breaking it down.  Cooking allows us to take more nutrient-dense foods and to pre-digest them outside our body, to break them down in the pot so that our bodies will have less work to do once we actually eat.

So this guy is obviously special interest funded, pushing the mainstream agenda of what we've been told our whole lives.  The most calorically dense food, the highest energy food is animal fat.  Nothing is going to give you more pure fat caloric energy than raw butter, raw cream, bone marrow, foods that don't have to be cooked to offer high caloric intakes, honey.  Plus, raw foods aren't hard to eat.  Our teeth wouldn't have been grinding away at raw things.  Raw fruits, raw meat, all those foods are easy to chew and you could even swallow them whole because we have the proper stomach acidity and digestive enzymes to break those down.  Cooking doesn't break down nutrients like vitamins and minerals to make them more available.  It breaks down macronutrients, protein, and carbohydrates into forms that are more absorbed, especially turning indigestible starches into sugars and stuff that can be eaten by our gut bacteria.

Dr.  Hamm herself is a cultural anthropologist, and while she's actually a little skeptical that cooking played such a direct role in our physical evolution, she's absolutely convinced it was huge in our social evolution.

You look at cultures around the world, and all cultures are cooking their food.  And there are many food cultures, I would say perhaps contemporary North American food culture being one of them, where you see a combination of cooked and raw eating.  In many cultures, raw foods are not a thing.  For example, where I do fieldwork in Ghana, you would not be considered to have eaten a meal if you ate raw food.  food there is considered to be cooked.  For those times where I was craving a salad, I would kind of secretly go to the market to buy vegetables and then hide out in my room and eat my salad by myself because I knew that it would be mocked.

That is how long it takes to procure your food.  You can spend all day hunting and foraging or just a small amount of time throughout the day going to the market to buy your food.  The reason they eat a lot of cooked food in Ghana is because they don't grow fresh fruits or vegetables in that region.  It's mostly starches, tubers, and animal-based foods.  And if you look across most indigenous groups of people, the reason they eat animal foods and starches is because they are calorically dense.  The goal of humans is to survive and reproduce.  We need calories to do that.  Fruits and vegetables aren't really good sources of calories, and salads didn't exist until this century.  We can get all of the vitamins, minerals, fatty acids we need from animal foods, grains, and you don't even need a small amount of fruits or vegetables. ",

The advent of things like stone basins and later water-safe pottery really would have allowed humans to get more from their food by boiling it.  In our romantic imaginations, ancient humans are roasting roasting meat on a stick over an open flame.  But with a tough piece of wild animal, it's amazing how little you can get off the bone this way.  But cook the same chunk in water for a few hours and everything literally falls off the bone.
