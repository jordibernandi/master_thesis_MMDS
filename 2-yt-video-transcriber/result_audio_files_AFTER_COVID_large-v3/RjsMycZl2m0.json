            "text": "Thank you.  Prayer.  Only three things it says for your life and prayer without ceasing is one of them.  So it's got to be real important.  Real important.  Because your whole life is supposed to be worship to God.  Your whole life is supposed to be glory to God.  Your whole life.  So if you want, and so you've got to have direct contact.  You've got to have that, if you don't have that everything else is shallow on the outside.  You've got to have the direct thing.  It's like if you have a marriage and you never have direct contact.  there's something wrong.  You want God's will for your life.  you've got to be directly in touch with Him.  That's got to be a joy.  The Bible speaks about the secret place.  The secret place.  You know I will meet you.  You know I will see your form in this.  Let me see you in the secret place.  Hide me in the secret place.  See you need a secret place with God every day.  You need a secret realm with God in your life every moment.  You need to have that.  But you need to have secret time with God.  You know remember what God said.  I will dwell with them but you got to make me a place.  You got to make me a tent.  And it was secret.  Holy of Holies.  Nobody went in there except the high priest once a year.  It was a secret place.  What does that say?  God's power is most strong in the secret place.  God's glory is most strong in your life in the secret place.  So you need a secret.  You need a place that is secret from everything else.  That is even secret, this is going to sound weird, but it's even secret from Christianity.  And what I mean by that is all, there's a million Christian things and it's all, many of them may be good.  That's fine.  But that's, that's maybe the holy place.  The secret place is just you and God.  Away from religion.  Away from, away from everything.  Now you need all the rest.  I mean all the rest is part of life.  You know it's all part.  I mean we need ministry.  We need this.  But it begins in the place that's just you and God.  You're not a, you know it's like even if you've been a great minister.  you need to get away from that to be with just God and then you can go back to that with the power of God.  You need a secret place with Lord.  it's just me and you.  Me and you until, well what about, yeah and then you can love your, then you can love your spouse.  But it's you and Him first.  It's, it's, and it's a place that Lord it's just me and nothing else.  You need a time in your life.  And you need a place every day of your life where you are separating from everything.  Where you are just making contact.  You're in contact.  You're in communion.  And it's important to have a fixed time too.  And it's not saying that you can always do it.  Things come up.  But in that, with a tabernacle God made, said make a tabernacle.  It was a fixed space.  They couldn't just do other things because if they didn't have that fixed place you know they're going to start selling things in there.  They're going to start doing a million things in that place.  So in the same way in life if you don't have a fixed place, a fixed set time in your life, a fixed space for God, everything's going to crowd it out.  Nature hates a vacuum.  So everything in your life, business, busyness, you know, the television, the web is going to crowd it out.  So that even your problems will crowd out.  So you need that Lord no matter what.  I am with you at this time.  And maybe, occasionally emergencies come up.  Well now okay I'll be, I'm going to make that time here.  But you need it.  The problem is if you don't fix it in some way it's not going to be there.  I want to look at the words, some of the words that are used for prayer.  And I wanted you to see kind of some revelations of this.  One of the words for prayer in the New Testament, I'll do it the best I can.  Ethel af re, re, res kia.  Everybody.  No, no, no.  It was the whole thing.  Not just the res kia.  It was the ethel.  Oh forget that.  That, you don't have to know that.  But here's what you have to know.  The word in Greek means To determine.  The word for prayer here means to also to determine.  Why?  Prayer determines everything else.  Prayer determines, will determine your day.  Prayer, being in God's presence or not, will determine the rest of your day.  Prayer even can determine the history, the changing of history.  prayer determines.  Another word for worship in the New Testament Greek is, is which means also, which means to minister.  As it's used to be to minister to the Lord.  So not only that you're praying, you're actually ministering to the Lord.  You're blessing the Lord.  Another word is proskuneo.  Try that one.  And that is a wonderful word because it means to kiss.  The word for prayer, proskuneo, also means to kiss.  We say what?  Kiss.  Well some people get like, you know, okay you're talking about kissing God.  Yeah I am.  Not physical.  Not carnal.  Spiritually.  You are one spiritually.  What is kissing?  It's an expression of love.  It's joining to another person.  Proskuneo.  To kiss God.  Well what does it say in the Song of Solomon?  Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth.  It means that it's deep.  It means that it's love.  It's like kissing.  Here's another one.  And not be on, which means literally be in the face of or in the presence of.  Before the face of that.  Some prayer is you're just, you just want to be with God.  Sometimes you have to be quiet and stop talking and just be with God Lord.  Just be with Lord.  Just, just Lord.  In your presence.  In your presence.  Worship.  It says pray without ceasing.  Pray without, what does that mean?  Pray without ceasing.  Some people take this and run with it in the wrong way.  Sometimes, you know, you know, you can be at a, at a, at a prayer meeting and someone just takes it.  I mean, God bless them.  But nobody else can get a word in after that.  We're going to pray Lord for the people in Africa by name.  Every one of them.  Run to, you know, alphabetically.  An hour later I'm up to Abu Abbas.  Oh no, they're still in the A's, you know.  Or sometimes you're at a, at a, at a diner.  Listen, listen.  We are to be able to pray long but don't pray for the sake of when you're other people and you're showing how much you pray.  You know, there could be at a diner, you know, and we always give thanks and say grace.  And I think it's also a good witness to do that, that people see the believers, you know.  But some people, oh Lord we beseech thee and manifest our gratitude for the tuna meld and the happy waitress special.  And, and now Lord we ask for your mercy on the condiments.  We have the ketchup.  It's not about how much you do.  You know, you can, you know, the, the, the Lord said, don't think it's your length of prayer.  you're going to impress anybody.  The pagans do that.  They just go over repetitious.  That's not, that's not it.  You know.  But, but it's not that.  You know, or sometimes, you know, you ever been with, with the believers and they're going on and on.  And listen to me.  But it's, it's just them going on.  It's not so much.  And sometimes you say amen.  And you're not saying amen because you're spiritual.  You're saying amen to stop the prayer.  Have you ever done that?  You've amen somebody to stop the prayer.  You're trying to amen them to submission.  Well it's not that.  But on the other hand what does it mean?  We are to be able to get into God's presence.  See again God is never looking at the words and He's never looking at, at how much what we do outwardly.  He's looking at the heart.  And we do need to be in His presence but with Him and, and we do need to let it go.  But what does it mean to go on?  It says pray without ceasing.  That's something different.  It's not just the experience of prayer it's talking about.  It's talking about the practice of prayer.  It's talking about, see if you, if it's just hey I prayed the prayer.  That's not what it, I prayed my prayer.  If I prayed my prayer the prayer is over.  And there are prayers to say that are over.  But what it's saying is something deeper.  God wants us to be in a state of prayer.  That means, it's not mean that you're always saying this and you're always having your eyes closed.  But you're always in a state of communion with prayer.  You make it your practice.  It's not based on feeling.  It's not based on, on, on an experience.  It's the way, it's my state of being.  I'm, first of all I'm, that I make prayer a regular part of my life in everything.  That is my decision.  I have to choose that.  I, because I do it when I, I can do it when I feel like it.  I got to do it when I don't feel like it.  That's the practice of prayer there.  And, but then I, that I am continually Lord I'm with you at every moment.  In every situation. ",
