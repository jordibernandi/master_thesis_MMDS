            "text": "what's up?  black and white sports fans john matrix here and i am back with another video.  make sure you guys hit that subscribe button.  also check out the join button for channel memberships and check out the merch.  let's get into this folks.  Last night, I put out a video talking about Derek Mason getting fired because he was absolutely terrible at Vanderbilt as the head football coach.  And we all know that Sarah Fuller, she ended up kicking in the game, the last game they played when they were getting blown out 21 to nothing and they lost 41 to nothing.  But of course, you know, the woke sports media, they were all talking about Sarah Fuller, you know, making headlines, you know, making history.  Nobody was talking about how awful the Vanderbilt football team is and Derek Mason is as a head coach.  And, folks, now we find out today that there's actually more to the Sarah Fuller story.  Okay?  Now, Sarah Fuller, a kicker, she kicked on one play the whole entire game.  I don't even think she's on a team anymore, to tell you the truth.  I really don't think that she is.  But, you know, Derek Mason, he's gone bye-bye now.  He's been fired.  Okay?  And it was clearly a stunt.  It was a woke stunt.  Nothing more.  That's exactly what it was.  And, of course, you know, Woke Center, Woke ESPN, they had to go out and they had to interview Sarah, Sarah Fuller.  OK, and this is actually on a Zoom call with Courtney Cronin.  I believe that's the way you pronounce her name.  And Sarah Fuller actually was the one to address the team at halftime.  Now, granted, she had never played in the game up to that point and they were getting blown out.  Twenty one to nothing.  OK, blown out.  But.  She was supposed to be the person that was going to motivate this team, really a person that's never played before.  But she got center stage, man.  This is why Vanderbilt is horrible at football.  This is probably another reason why Derek Mason was fired.  But this is what she said about making her speech at halftime.  OK, and she absolutely ripped the team.  OK, now remember, she's a soccer player.  She's not a football player, even though soccer technically is football.  Different sport, though.  But I digress.  She said this, quote, If I'm going to be honest, I was a little pissed off at how quiet everybody was on the sideline.  We made it first down and I was the only one cheering.  and I was like, what the heck?  What's going on?  And I tried to get them pumped up and I was like, quote, You guys need to start cheering on your team.  OK, now she was all hyped up about about a first down, you know.  As bad as Vanderbilt was, you know, doing that game, I guess a first down is like a touchdown, you know, to her.  But apparently they were unmotivated.  That just tells me, you know, that Derek Mason was horrible at motivating his team for anything that had to do with the game of football, okay?  But she continues on here.  Quote, my main thing was doing the SEC tournament.  My entire team was cheering the entire time.  It didn't matter if we were in the locker room or if they were on the sidelines.  I think that's what won it for us.  Everybody was cheering nonstop.  I just went in there and I said exactly what I was thinking.  I was like, we need to be cheering on each other.  this is how you win games.  This is how you get better by calling each other out for stuff.  And I'm not, and I'm going to call you guys out.  And that's what she exactly did, man.  She called them out for apparently seeming to not be energetic and supporting the team because of first down.  Now I've seen a lot of football folks.  I haven't seen too many times when teams are on the sideline and they're cheering a first down.  I mean, first downs are pretty much a given.  I really haven't noticed teams actually cheering a first down.  I've seen players on the sideline, you know, cheer when they make a big play, when they make a touchdown.  That's what I see teams cheering for.  Not necessarily first downs.  First downs, as important as they are, they're not really game-changing, okay?  Everybody gets first downs.  That's just the way it is, okay?  And she goes on, we need to be supporting one another.  If we get a first down, if an interception happens, it's our fault.  We need to be lifting each other up.  That's what a team's about.  I think this team has struggled, and that's been part of it.  We really just need to build that team camaraderie where they can all lean on one another.  It was an adjustment going from that team mentality where, hey, we're all here supporting one another.  And I just wanted to bring this to this team.  Well, I guess, you know, when you're 0-8 or 0-7 up to that point and you're getting blown out 21 to nothing, you don't have a whole lot to cheer about, you know, in that game.  Now, she was only a part of the team for that one game, not the other seven games.  We've seen many times, you know, when teams are getting blown out, man, nobody's happy on the sideline.  Nobody is.  I haven't seen Vanderbilt play, you know, this entire season.  I mean, I don't like watching losing teams that much, but it does happen.  And when teams are getting blown out, when you're that bad, nobody is going to be happy.  Absolutely nobody's going to be happy.  But why is it that she needs to be the voice of reason for this team?  Why does it take a woman that doesn't even play football to come into the locker room at halftime and try to motivate them?  I mean, was Derek Mason not doing coaching during halftime?  What about halftime adjustments?  You know, that kind of thing.  I don't know, but I guess it doesn't matter anyway because he is now fired.  He is now gone and he deserved to be fired.  You know, he really, really did deserve to be fired.  You know, he pulled this stunt.  He brought in a soccer player that never kicked a football before ever just for some woke publicity stunt and nothing more than that.  But Sarah Fuller comes in and she rips the team.  This is pretty much how she's introduced to the team, man, by ripping them at the half.  But that's just my thoughts on this.  What do you guys think of this?  Sarah Fuller coming in and destroying the Vanderbilt football team because they weren't cheering the team?  This is Derrick Mason's fault, man.  All of this that's happening right now is Derrick Mason's fault, and he has paid the ultimate price with his job.  Wow.  Anyway, guys, let me know what you think about all this in the comments.
