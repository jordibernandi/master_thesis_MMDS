They have many candidate shapes allowed by the math, over 10 to the power of 500 possibilities, which is a massive number.  String theorists have instead proposed that all of these possibilities are equally probable and likely exist somewhere within a multiverse.  meaning there are at least 10 to the power of 500 differently tuned universes out there in the multiverse, maybe even infinite numbers.
