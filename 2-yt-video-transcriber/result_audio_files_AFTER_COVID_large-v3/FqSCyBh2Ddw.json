            "text": "Hello everybody and welcome back to another video.  Before we get started, please make sure to go check out part one of this little mini-series, which was Joe Biden's path to victory.  The link to that video is going to pop up in the top right of your screen right now, so I'll give you a few seconds to click on that before I get started.  Okay, now that you're hopefully all caught up, let's identify and analyze the three most important states.  Donald Trump absolutely must win to reach 270 electoral votes and be re-elected to another four years in office.  These are three states that his campaign should spend a significant chunk of resources and time on before November 3rd.  But before we even do that, Texas, Georgia, Ohio, and Iowa are all battleground states he is expected to win and absolutely must win.  However, given their status as pretty convincingly red states in 2016 that are also given for him to need in 2020, I am not going to be counting any of them towards this video.  However, with these four states in his camp, he holds 204 electoral votes, only 8 behind Joe Biden's 212.  Now we can start with the first state that Trump absolutely cannot lose in his path to 270, and that is Florida.  Its 29 electoral votes are the most of any competitive state over the last few decades.  which is exactly why it is considered to be the biggest prize in any election cycle.  For reference, George H.W.  Bush was the last candidate to win Florida by more than 5.5 points, and that was all the way back in 1988.  And looking back at the 2016 election, Trump defeated Clinton by 1.2 points.  And that came after Hillary spent the majority of her resources trying to lock down the state in the final weeks before the election.  However, polls were showing a trend towards Trump over that time though.  And so it wasn't shocking whatsoever that he managed to pull off the victory.  saying that it would be irrelevant if it weren't for the same kind of trend occurring right now.  joe biden's lead on rcp is down to just one point well within the margin of error and trump has also taken a lead in betting odds in florida which is further indication that he is becoming likelier and likelier to win in not just the eyes of pundits but the public as well.  After all, the state does tend to vote for incumbents more often, and the large Latino vote in Florida has trended significantly towards the president since 2016.  Ultimately, Trump needs Florida a whole lot more as well, hence why I did not include it in Biden's path to victory two days ago.  But say that Biden were to win Florida, he would be at 241 electoral votes and 261 if you include the 2016 Clinton states.  So all that would be left for Biden to do is win one of the five states left in gray.  So if anything, that would suggest that President Trump needs to win it more than any other argument made so far.  And the final thing we can do is take a look at the early voting numbers from Florida, where there are a lot of promising signs for Republicans.  While yes the Democrats may lead by 19% so far, the margin is definitely starting to shrink.  Plus, it was always a given that Democrats would vote early and at a higher rate than Republicans who will eventually vote on election day at a much higher rate as well.  But anyways, the second state on this list is North Carolina.  At the start of this cycle, North Carolina was grouped in with like Ohio and Iowa as Trump states that stand little chance of flipping.  However, polling data throughout this cycle has shown Trump very close and similar to his numbers in Florida.  And surprisingly, he is now actually behind in North Carolina by two and a half points, which is a full 1.5 points higher than in Florida.  And early voting numbers look worse here for Republicans than Florida as well, which could be because of the fact that Democrats outnumber Republicans by a lot more, but still, Republicans make up just 29% of the nearly 2 million ballots cast thus far in North Carolina.  And that should be, no matter what perspective you have, very concerning for the Republican Party.  Nevertheless, though, Trump would have to lose a 3.6 point lead from four years ago, which is a lot harder to do than you might think.  As for the importance of North Carolina on the election map specifically, like Florida, it is very hard to see a scenario where Trump loses the state and still manages to reach 270. honestly for him to have any chance at re-election he absolutely must win all of the states within the margin of error.  so that means texas georgia ohio and iowa as mentioned at the start of this video plus florida north carolina arizona and the final state which i will be highlighting in this video pennsylvania which happened to also be one of biden's states in his path to victory.  But out of the four 2016 Trump states remaining, Pennsylvania is a lot less losable than Arizona, Wisconsin, or Michigan, partially based on polling, and partially based on the electoral weight it holds.  Currently, according to RCP, Joe Biden leads by 3.7 points, which is confusing in a lot of ways because that is exactly half of his lead on 538, which is 6.4 points.  Putting that statistical discrepancy aside though, with a win in Pennsylvania, Trump would reach 268 electoral votes, so all he would need is one more battleground state of any size or scope.  now technically in a hypothetical he could hold on to nebraska's second district and if biden were to sweep the rest of the country we would have the dreaded electoral tie scenario at 269 to 269. but that is highly unlikely.  and now i'm trying to figure out what i wanted to cover from trump's perspective that i didn't already go over with biden.  I guess we could take a look at the early voting numbers according to NBC, where the Democrats are up by a significant margin, although Pennsylvania's early numbers aren't usually as reliable as other states that vote early more often.  But that is mostly it for Trump's path to 270.  The most likely state remaining for him to win is the state of Arizona, but he could hypothetically lose all but any one of the states remaining and still win the race because of Florida, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania.
