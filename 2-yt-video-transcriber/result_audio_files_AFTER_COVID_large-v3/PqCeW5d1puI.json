There are few characters in American politics today who represent... the rot that exists in the Republican Party better than Lindsey Graham from South Carolina.  He really is an abhorrent character who is the embodiment of disloyalty, not only to that which is righteous and ethical and upstanding and decent, but also disloyal to a man he considered his best friend.  Lindsey Graham is up for reelection this year in South Carolina.  His Senate seat is in danger to a man named Jamie Harrison, who is running against him, the Democrat Jamie Harrison, doing very well in the polls.  A moral, ethical, decent person could possibly take that seat.  And there is a super PAC out there right now called Lindsey Must Go PAC.  And they just released an ad that absolutely devastates Lindsey Graham.  And takes one more chip out of the armor of his seat.  His incumbency.  Using only his own words.  I'm going to play the ad.  And then we're going to get into a little bit about exactly why Lindsey Graham must go.  And it all really is based around his disloyalty to a man.  These fake tears he shed.  about John McCain, an American hero, after he died, while being cozy and one of the greatest allies to a man who has done nothing but denigrate John McCain before and after his death.  Here's the ad from Lindsay Must Go Pack. ",

Every time I turn around, I'm being asked about Donald Trump saying one dumb thing after another, and I'm tired of it.  President Trump deserves a Nobel Peace Prize and then some.  He's a race-baiting, xenophobic, religious bigot.  No, I don't think he's a xenophobic, race-baiting, religious bigot.  I've never known an impeachment trial without a witness.

This is just from a CNN interview.  It took a couple of moments.

And if someone had dedicated as much vitriol... and venom and bile toward my best friend half, one-tenth as much as Donald Trump directed at John McCain, that person would be dead to me.  They certainly wouldn't be a political ally, someone that I would spend political capital and reputation defending.  And that is exactly where we find ourselves with Lindsey Graham.

That one of the things, the great things he learned from John McCain was to serve a cause greater than himself.  Apparently, Lindsey Graham did not learn that lesson.  He is not serving a cause greater than himself.  He's serving Donald Trump.  He's serving the personal and political interest of Donald Trump.  He's not serving his country.  What's best for the country.  He's serving Donald John Trump.  Let me say this Lindsey Graham.  Nobody's looking at you brother to replace the great John McCain.  Nobody is looking to you.  to replace John McCain, you spineless coward.  And then finally, if you want to be, if you want to help the country and you want to serve this nation, be more like John McCain.  I would ask you, Lindsey Graham, that same question.  I would put that charge to you.  Why don't you be a little bit more like your best friend, John McCain, rather than this whipped, frightened puppy with Donald Trump, who is chipping away.  He is human erosion at our constitution, at our democratic norms, of our standards of decency and decorum.  And you do nothing.  You support him in this.  He went from being a jackass and a xenophobic religious bigot to your best buddy.  He's your new best friend.  So anyway, good luck to Jamie Harrison.  If you're in South Carolina, listen, you have a duty.  to get out there and vote this election, because this is a real chance to get rid of somebody who is the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, someone in Senate leadership, to get rid of him, to get rid of one of Donald Trump's staunchest allies who refused to hold Donald Trump accountable during the impeachment trial.
