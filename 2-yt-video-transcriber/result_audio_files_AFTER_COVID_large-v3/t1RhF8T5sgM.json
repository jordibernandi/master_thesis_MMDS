San Francisco to rename Abraham Lincoln High School because former president did not demonstrate that black lives mattered to him.  It's true, guys.  Ending slavery is not enough.  I'm Tyler Zedd.  Welcome to Zeducation.  Welcome to my channel and welcome to another SJW episode where we highlight and we document the insanity that we are seeing with this social justice movement and this push for social change.  take for example the intro.  the presidents that ended slavery is now being erased.  his memories being erased because he didn't do enough ended slavery Yes.  As always on this series, if you cringe at any of these examples, you win.  It means your brain is working.  It means you know that this stuff is not uniting people.  It's not doing anything positive.  It's not bringing people together, period.  And if you are new to this series, before we get into the rest of today's examples, which come in the form of many things, with gender, with fatphobia, with race, the social justice movement, is far and wide.  but before we get into the rest of today's examples let me just show you this one here back in the 1960s.  this is what our world was.  we were segregated.  this was not okay obviously and those laws are gone but they're coming back in other forms like this in 2020 dei session people of color.  dei session people who are whites separating and dividing based on what we look like.  this is where we are.  nothing has changed.  it's just coming back in another form and this is okay in 2020. how is this uniting and how is this healing?  somebody please tell me in the comments.  please enlighten me while you're down there in the comments letting me know what you think about that.  please like this video.  also please be sure that you are subscribed and have the bell click for notifications when new videos are uploaded.  now let's get on to some more examples of this absurdity that we are seeing in our culture today.  and if you cringe you win from the national review.  medical ethicist elderly shouldn't get vaccines first because they're too whites and in this article older populations are whites instead of giving additional health benefits to those who already had more of them.  we can start to level the playing field a bit.  yeah yeah equality unity.  we're starting it off.  right guys it's just don't give white people vaccines.  it's just not fair it's that's not equal.  nancy pelosi who described 600 as a significant stimulus for working families has a net worth of more than 100 million dollars.  Your misogyny is showing.  Don't criticize any women.  That's misogynistic, okay?  You can't criticize Nancy Pelosi.  That means you hate women. ",

            "text": "If you want to be a great ally to fat people, here are some things you can do.  When you go to the doctor, encourage them to do the following things.  Eliminate any weight or BMI cutoff policies.  Stop using the BMI completely because it is ineffective and racist.  Get medical equipment that will actually work for fat patients, like blood pressure cups that fit, and won't give a false high reading because they're too tight.  Set up their office in a way that makes it usable for fat people, like putting chairs without arms in every room.  When you go to a clothing store, tell them to expand their size range.  It does not matter what their size range currently is.  Tell them to expand it.  If you work in education, get in touch with the health and PE departments.  Ask them if they have anything in their curriculum that involves students weighing themselves, counting calories, or using the BMI in any capacity. ",

And it actually is a good indicator of whether or not you are obese or not, unless you are a bodybuilder or have a ton of muscle.  Because if you're jacked, if you're Arnold Schwarzenegger, it's going to tell you that you're obese because you have higher density in your body.  But if you're not muscular and you are bigger, it's a pretty good indicator that you need to make some changes.  There's nothing sexier than a nice beta male.  Women, is this what you want in your life?  Do you want a beta that you can throw around and dominate?  Is that what you want?  My response to this is... I hope you find happiness, but the chances of that are very, very, very low, and I pity you.  I do.  In an effort to be more inclusive of transgender people, the provincial court of British Columbia has created a new policy asking lawyers to provide pronouns when introducing themselves and their clients in court.  Coming to a US Congress near you, the votes of black Americans should count twice.  Vote reparations would empower us to replace oppressive institutions with life.  affirming structures of equality, promoting equality and also promoting two votes for some Americans and one vote for others.  They're doing that in the same article.  Very ironic.  Chicago chef Stephanie Izzard apologizes after culturally appropriating a Korean dish on Instagram.  Finally, we are addressing the cultural appropriation of food.  Guys, Italians, stand up for yourselves.  No more pizza across America.  That's appropriating Italian food, all right?  So I'm glad that we're taking a stand, finally, against culturally appropriating food. ",

I also just wanna remind you guys that these aren't just some fringe tweets out there that have a couple of likes.  These tweets that I'm showing are getting thousands of engagements.  This is being accepted by many, many people.  My white guilt is so prevalent that I don't feel comfortable with the idea of having 100% white children.  Uh, it's hard to tell if this is satire or not, but I'm just going to go ahead and say with everything else we've seen already that this is real.  Um, drinking water upholds white supremacy as many African countries don't have access to clean water.  If you drink it, you are responsible for racism and poverty.  All right.  I refuse to believe that that one's real.  That is definitely satire.  If it isn't, then we have some serious problems.  We already have serious problems, but if this is where people's heads are at, Wow.  Regarding military hair standards for women, I'm just gonna drop this here.  Tell me what I gain as a leader and soldier by having to transform the hair on the left into the hair on the right every morning.  And go ahead, ask me how I do it.  It's usually the first question I get.  I'm just gonna go ahead and say if you can't fall within line of the military regulations, you don't belong in the military.  That's the truth.  And once we start being lenient on that stuff, which is already happening by the way, good luck against countries like China in the future.  We're screwed.  China doesn't care about this stuff.  They don't care at all.  They are laughing when they see crap like this.  I'm watching The Crown.  Disappointed by the lack of diversity in this cast.  Alright, Whitney Cummings is a comedian.  So I'm pretty sure she's joking here.  i don't know that's.  that's where we're at is.  i don't know when people are joking about this stuff anymore.  she could be serious and there's probably a lot of people out there that are serious.  biden wants to pick boston mayor marty walsh for labor secretary but is concerned about him being white can you imagine can you imagine if it said something like but is concerned about him bullying any other race?  That's where we're at.  This is okay now.  This is normalized.  And this is going to continue to be normalized and pushed harder and harder for the next two years after the Dems won the Senate.  This is who is left at the White House to advise Donald Trump.  Write his speeches and push his policies.  This is Stephen Miller.  Note the white power sign he is making inside the White House press briefing room.  Right now, America is being guided by a white supremacist.  And there's a symbol.  It looks to me like he is adjusting his coats, just using my brain.  But I also want to ask you, Mr.  Winslow, if this symbol matters or this one matters.  People like this guy are insane.  They see what they want to see.  This is the world they want to live in.  They want to see this.  They want to create something out of nothing.  And then they push it to people and people believe it.  It's disgusting.  A transgender activist called for every child to be put on puberty blockers until they can make an informed decision on their gender.  It's real.  That's real.  Senator Hirono wants men to just shut up and do the right thing for a change.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  All right.  Shut up, everyone.  Don't question this stuff.  Don't criticize it.  Let it run amok.  OK, justice, justice involves erasing the guy who ended slavery.  Justice involves men shutting up and justice involves modern segregation.  for justice, for equality and for unity.  Guys, just shut up.  Let me know how you guys did in today's episode.  Did you cringe at all?  Are you for justice, inequality and unity?  Are you?  Let me know in the comments while you're down there.  Please like this video.  Please help me get a recommend to others.  That's it for today's video.  Until next time, I'm Tyler Zedd, and this is education.  A man and a woman.  Idiots! ",
