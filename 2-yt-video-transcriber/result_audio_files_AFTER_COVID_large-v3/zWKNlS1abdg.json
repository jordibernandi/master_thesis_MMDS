But I believe that's why a policy is written as far as no recordings.  Because in the past, if you look at some of these places where they've had some terroristic threats, where they've had buses explode, stuff like that, these people are researching the buses.  Hey, where's a large metal object underneath the bus that we can put a magnet at?  And so that's why you've got people, especially like at Lucas Oil, when the Colts come in or like when the Bengals or whoever's playing at Lucas Oil.  Sure.  They actually have this long stick that's got a mirror on it, and they'll walk around the bus and shine underneath the bus just to make sure that there's not a bomb or anything on the bus. ",

I'm just going to do a little walkthrough here.  Everybody else looks like they already did.  I just wanted to finish my walkthrough since we were heading in camera right away about it.  Now, they are still running with seven days a week, and they have now included more Saturday routes, and there are three bus days.  This is Saturday, the 18th, 19th.  That one saw.  And of course you saw.  on that hill of Rogue Nation, John Speedway joined us.  And there's John Speedway there.  He joined us and then we're also with Indy News on the streets.  He's out here as well.  Ma'am, I just suggest that you... So you're not going to talk to me now?  We're doing a story.  Get over it.  You're in public.  I'd say get over it, dude.  You're in public.  I don't, I just, if you want somebody to respect you, I... But ma'am, if you're talking about us, you didn't respect us.  You came up and tried to tell us we couldn't do anything.  You told us we couldn't do anything.  I suggest you go talk to your boss, John Nolan, and ask him about my lawsuit that I'm filing against your company.  I suggest you go re-read that policy from Indigo.  Okay?  That was updated in 2017.  Okay?  You don't care?  You don't care?  You're trying to enact a policy that you don't even know, ma'am.  Have a good day.  And see, you know what?  With that attitude, ma'am, with that attitude, I'm going to come after your qualifications as well.  Great attitude.  I'll be calling John Nolan again and leave another voicemail that he won't return.  That's exactly the kind of leadership that Nolan Security has with their security guards.  Ridiculous.  Absolutely 100% ridiculous.  100%.  Those people over there.  Those people over there had problems with this filming, obviously.  So anyway, we're we're headed out.  We'll probably be doing another revisit here.  Thought this one I was given.  I talked to their public affairs officer and.  He told me that we wouldn't have another problem down here.  That's why we came back to make sure that there was going to be no problem.  Well, looks like we did.  So, beyond notice, Indigo, we'll be back. ",
