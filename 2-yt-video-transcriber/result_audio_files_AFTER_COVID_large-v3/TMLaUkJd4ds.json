            "text": "My name is Rachel Levine.  I'm the Biden administration's new secretary of COVID.  And many young people aren't wearing their masks because they don't think it's lit.  But I'm telling you right now, you can turn up and have a great party even with your masks on.  And I'm no stranger to partying.  I love jellies and buttons and Black Beauties, Abyssinian Tea, Candy, Tranks, Circles, Erasers, Wolfies, Jellies, Moggies, Valleys, Eggs, School Bus, I Love a Little Aunt Nora, French Fries, Liquid X, Blind Squid, Cat Valium, Green Jet, Special K, Super Acid, African Salad, Herbal Speedball, Electric Kool-Aid, Sugar Cube, Purple Haze, Yellow Sunshine, Big Chief, Cactus, San Pedro, Alice, Boomers, Caps, Cow Patties, Fungus, Tweezies, Yellow Fever, Velvet, Skittles, Triple C, Magic Mint, and Bath Salts.  So listen, kids, your new health secretary isn't an old fuddy-duddy.  I like robo-tripping as good as the next person, okay?  The safest thing you could do is wear your mask, get vaccinated, and then let's fucking get this party started right.  Also, after a short battle with COVID-19, the president of the United States, Joe Biden, has passed away. ",
