            "text": "well this is a refreshing story.  i didn't know if i was going to put this on midwestly or here on the quartering because well it's kind of a get woke go broke thing.  so i felt you know this is where it should be.  now red bull is um one of my.  i guess i'd like to say a few vices but i have too many vices.  uh just look at me i'm trying to get fewer vices.  everybody vices are are good but But having too many vices is probably not great.  But Red Bull is obviously a super huge megacorporation.  Part of them getting into mainstream, at least for me, was mixing it with Jaeger back in the day.  Now, obviously, there are so much more than that.  They have race teams.  They have the flutog.  My wife is a pilot.  She loves going to their races.  They have these like speed races with the planes.  I don't know what they're called.  I prefer being on the ground.  But nonetheless, it looks like Red Bull has refused to get woke and has refused to issue politically divisive statements in the light of everything that's been going on the last few weeks.  And someone just got fired.  I love it.  I love it.  uh it's it's been like this information leak uh like back and forth and three idiots just got fired.  uh for it which is amazing.  so Red Bull employees leaked an offensive slide from a company meeting.  It showed a repurposed map, meme, that described India as call centers, China as they make our stuff, and Africa as zoo animals come from here.  Oh, zoo animals come from here.  So?  That's funny.  I wouldn't put it in a company meeting.  but when you find out why they leaked it, then this story gets even more hilarious.  So, Red Bull employees... leak an image of a slide from a february marketing meeting that some employees called offensive.  the slide included repurposed map we already talked about according to employees.  a colleague complained about the slide to hr but nothing came of it.  the leak comes as red bull faces criticism from employees for its public silence on the black lives matter movement.  well i for one.
