            "text": "There's a sensible generalization going around given the environment today that says you can't trust a woman.  I think the problem lies that essentially men trust women without any boundaries whatsoever.  Then complain that essentially a perfect stranger betrayed them.  Well, yeah.  Basically, it comes down to men don't test women.  They don't reveal a woman's character.  They don't want to do anything to displease her or to make her leave or to make the fantasy crumble.  So most men will say nothing.  They won't ask her questions.  They won't test her virtues, her values and her moral character.  Now, this isn't me trying to spit game at you.  But if you're a guy who knows within yourself that you want children, you want a family and so forth, but you recognize also quite sensibly that the environment is very dangerous and it's really hard to have a relationship today, a trusting one.  And from time to time, you'll have people in the comments saying, well, fair enough, human.  I can't disagree with much of what you're saying, but you never offer any solutions.  I don't like telling people what to do, but... Here's a constructive strategy I'd like to offer you guys where nothing will stop you if you want to get married and have children and move in with a woman.  In facing whether or not pumpkin is actually worth signing your life over to in terms of trusting someone completely with your life and your potential children should you want them.  The closest thing I found in my past experience where I've had multi-year relationships with someone and then you're getting close to the point of going further as in talking about moving in together or so forth, there was always one thing that revealed quite clearly whether or not this person was consistent in terms of who they were in your previous day-to-day dating compared to who this person might be if you lived with them day in, day out, 24 seven.  Here is a very, very practical strategy to see whether or not a woman's character matches the fantasy of what you think she'll be like when you move in with her or if you choose to get married with her and have children with her.  Place the both of you in an environment that will approximate being married with this person in the future or living with them 24 seven.  What does that?  In my experience, it's been go on a holiday with them.  So even if you're a guy that's agreeable and you don't want to say anything to mess things up, you don't want to get her angry, you want things to stay calm in your relationship, simply going on holiday will reveal to you in complete clarity, most of the time, it's not foolproof, but I would say this is one of the best tests to reveal the character of a person and whether you can relate to them honestly.  Because you can fool yourself and one or both of you can lie when you visit each other and then go back to your own home and you're not living together.  Go on a vacation.  Go on a holiday.  Be stuck with each other, not for a weekend, but for weeks or a month if you can.  Be stuck somewhere in a foreign environment where you only have to rely on each other.  See if she has a temper.  See her impatience.  See if she looks out for you.  In my case in the past, I remember two quite serious relationships that when I went on a holiday with them, a long holiday, it revealed without doubt that this person did not love me.  This person only saw themselves.  This person was irritated with me because I wasn't a dog on a leash on their holiday.  I wasn't allowed to be myself.  I saw their lack of sympathy.  I saw their anger.  I saw their impatience.  I saw their cruelty to other people, to me.  Living in someone's pocket 24-7 where you only have to rely on each other, you quite literally only have each other to rely on as anything familiar in this foreign place while you're trying to enjoy each other's company and have a positive experience.  Usually vacations and holidays where you spend all your time together reveal much, much more than very easy experiences convenient relationships where you see each other from time to time and then you can go back to your own little space, your own world.  You can have time to yourself.  It allows you to glean aspects of her character and then really start to see.  this is what this person would be like to live with.  It reminds me of a video Monday did.  a long time ago, his channel's no longer up, where he said that in old times, men and women used to have the environment to test each other.  It used to be a harsher environment that would test each other's moral character and moral fiber to see what the other person's made of.  You reveal their virtues, their ethics, their morals, the really important things that went in to make that specific individual up.  So that's my test for women in terms of guys, because guys will conveniently not want to test women because they don't really have to.  If you can go back to your own place and you're just seeing each other intermittently, even if it is a serious relationship, you've got your space, she's got hers.  If you're really considering in the future moving in, having a family and so on and so forth, go on a long vacation.  Reveal the person's true character.  Reveal a character that you can see whether or not you can or cannot live with.  Let me know your thoughts in the comment section.  As always, please subscribe and hit the bell icon.  Select all.
