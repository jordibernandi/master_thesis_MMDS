            "text": "Australia Day was celebrated on January 26th, and if you're one of those people that partook in Australia Day celebrations, then you are complicit in colonialism, racism, genocide, white supremacy, and a few other bigotry bingo terms.  I'm sure I've left out.  And along with this day of hate is the somewhat pointless tradition of the Australia Day Awards.  I say pointless because it includes awarding musicians, actors, sports people, and politicians with honours.  Now, I don't have anything against those groups.  Well, maybe politicians and woke actors, which is most of them.  Anyway, I just think there's already plenty of award ceremonies for those groups to perform mutual reach-arounds on each other for basically doing their jobs.  And yet another tradition accompanying these awards is the annual bitch fest by entitled privileged females crying about the fact that women make up less than half of honours recipients, primarily because said whingers don't have any real struggles in their life and so concern themselves with petty bullshit like this to offset a raging case of penis envy.  The fact is, the general public is responsible for nominating those that receive honours, and then a government panel ultimately decides who gets the awards.  And it's not the case that women are being disproportionately turned down.  In fact, it's the complete opposite.  For example, in 2018, 33% of the nominees were women and 35% of the recipients were women.  This year, 41.6% of recipients were women.  And as the ABC reports, in the wake of the governor general prioritizing gender parity.  So in other words, we now have another domain in life in which women are automatically suspect because they may have received an award based on gender diversity rather than merit.  Well done for conferring the soft bigotry of low expectations on an entire gender.  I wonder if the Governor-General is going to get behind the move to gender parity for university students in Australia.  Probably not, because there isn't such a movement.  That would require the application of consistent principles.  And if you know anything about feminists and their so-called gender equality apparatchiks, you'll know that they've all had a consistency and hypocrisy bypass that enables them to push a lopsided agenda and still pretend they're arguing for equality.  Let's be clear.  There is no reason why women should be 50% of Australia Day nominees or recipients.  And if you're consistent, there is no reason why men should be either.  It comes down to who is nominated.  And if more men are nominated, then so be it.  And you can bet the moment that women comprise more than 50% of nominees and recipients, the gender socialists will suddenly go silent and move on to their next cherry-picked issue.  Now, another way in which the gender cultists don't believe their own bullshit is that they only want certain types of women to receive awards, women that subscribe to certain political viewpoints.  So, of course, a collective brain hemorrhage reverberated through the Cat Lady community with the announcement that Bettina Arndt was receiving an Australia Day honour specifically for significant service to the community as a social commentator and to gender equity through advocacy for men.  Imagine the vain popping rage that ensued on that news, especially the reference to significant service to gender equity through advocacy for men.  Actually, you don't have to imagine it.  You can just read any one of the scores of articles decrying it.  For example, the completely objective take from the objectively titled Women's Agenda.  No, there is no evidence of Bettina Arndt's contributions to gender equity.  Well, of course there isn't, if you selectively cherry-pick a few issues and misrepresent them, which is exactly what this article does.  For example, Bettina Arndt's website, which has the hashtag, hashtag men too, says, for example is all rhetoric and no evidence in its assertion that women are the aggressors and abusers of men.  now i did a search of bettina arndt's site and i can't find that assertion anywhere but it is so vague as to be meaningless anyway.  of course men are more likely to be attacked by other men But as this article is primarily concerned with domestic violence or intimate partner violence, then that statement would be broadly true.  You can check this yourself using the Australian Bureau of Statistics data, which our domestic violence industrial complex admitted in a Senate Estimates Committee hearing is the best data we have in Australia.  The article just proceeds with these kind of vague claims.  Former Australian of the Year Rosie Batty remarked that I was completely shocked and then I was quite dismayed.  I couldn't help but wonder how it could be that someone has been rewarded for work that actually pits men against women.  Now this is a marvellous act of projection on Batty's part.  She has been at the forefront of the gendered approach to domestic violence that promotes the female victim, male perpetrator angle.  You'd be hard pressed to come up with someone that has done more to pit men against women on this particular issue than or at the very least consent to be wheeled out as the figurehead on cue in said movement.  an approach by the way that hasn't yielded any positive results in reducing rates of domestic violence.  and then there's the smear campaign.  how can a woman who supports a convicted male pedophile be rewarded.  The decision to appoint Bettina Arndt a member of the Order of Australia for significant service to the community as a social commentator and to gender equity through advocacy for men demeans the awards and degrades the concept of rewarding those who work in the public interest.  Worse, it makes clear these awards are not based on merit.  Yes, well, I wonder if Price can understand the irony of her use of the word demeaning.  But aren't you one of those people that have consistently argued it's not about merit?  Here she is in 2018 urging you to go out and nominate women.  Not people based on their merits, but women.  And this is her rock-solid reasoning.  Considering women do a huge proportion of volunteering, you'd expect 50-50.  Really?  That's it?  No data?  Just truth by assertion?  But let's assume that women are the majority of volunteers.  Could that be because they aren't doing other things, like working full-time?  After all, women only make up about 35% of full-time workers in this country, and as we know, a lot of people who get these awards do so just for doing their jobs.  And since men have more of those, perhaps that partially explains the skew.  I'm also eagerly awaiting Jenna Price's article titled, Let's Revoke Tracy Spicer's 2018 Award for Exposing Sexual Assault Victims in her documentary.  But what can you expect from an academic at UTS where merit goes to die?  But let's deal with this claim of Arndt supporting a paedophile.  Bettina Arndt interviewed convicted sex offender Nicholas Bester on her YouTube channel a little over a year ago.  As The Guardian puts it, Bester had been jailed for grooming and repeatedly raping his 15-year-old student when he was a 58-year-old teacher in Tasmania.  He was convicted of possessing 28 pieces of child pornography and committing up to 30 sexual assaults.  On an internet forum in 2015 after being released from prison, Bester wrote that his crime was awesome.  The paedophile was then convicted a second time as a result and for sharing further child exploitation material.  The majority of men in Australia envy me, Bester wrote in 2015.  I was 59, she was 15 going on 25.  It was awesome.  So why in the hell would Bettina Arndt interview this convicted sex offender?  Well, I'm glad you asked, because Arndt wrote this piece on her own website.  She claims she wasn't defending his acts, which she condemned and said he was right to be sent to prison for.  She was objecting to what she saw as the vigilante justice mob that had systematically hounded him since he was released from prison.  For example, they were trying to prevent him studying a PhD at Hobart University.  Arndt also apologised for the relaxed tone of the interview and claimed that the 60 Minutes story on the incident was selectively edited to make her look bad.  Now, whatever you think of Bester and what he did, he did his time.  If you think Bester should be locked up and the key thrown away, well, then your problem is with the justice system, not with him trying to get an education.  That said, it appears to be a strange and perhaps unwise choice of interview subject.  But since when has Bettina Arndt shied away from taking on difficult subjects?  Anyway, have a read of Bettina Arndt's explanation and listen to this interview she gave recently when asked about it.  Links in the comments.  now another point of attack on bettina arndt has been to claim that she has consistently misrepresented her professional credentials essentially that she's a fraud.  probably the most exhaustive treatment of this was an article written in new matilda Psychologist, clinical psychologist, doctor, or none of the above?  Will the real Bettina Arndt AM please stand up?  And take note of one of the authors here, Nina Fennell, because it will become relevant later.  For many years, Bettina Arndt has been passed off by the Australian media as a psychologist and clinical psychologist.  more recently she has been credited as dr arndt in the australian newspaper and in federal parliament but a long-running new matilda investigation has discovered that mrs arndt is not a doctor has never obtained a phd and nor as it turns out is she a psychologist or clinical psychologist.  They spend the first few paragraphs going over the Bester interview and Rosie Batty's irrelevant response.  And then we get to this paragraph.  But as the debate rages on, a new challenge has presented itself to Ms.  Arndt, explaining to the Australian public how and why so many people believe she's a psychologist.  Do they, though?  If you asked a random sample of people what Bettina Arndt does, would they say she's a psychologist or would they say she's a social commentator?  You know, like the Order of Australia that she received for significant service to the community as a social commentator.  I mean, she doesn't have a practice and never has.  She spends her time in the media and more recently doing a tour of college campuses.  The article goes on.  Miss Arndt, in a lengthy interview with New Matilda, acknowledged she is not a psychologist or clinical psychologist despite hundreds of representations to the contrary.  Nor has she ever been registered as either anywhere in Australia.  Miss Arndt also confirmed she is not a doctor and has never obtained a PhD.  Well, that's true.  She's not a psychologist today, nor has she ever been registered.  But there was no registration of psychologists in Australia until 1989.  And one look at her CV shows that she had well and truly moved on to being a social commentator by then.  It might be worth mentioning that she completed a Master of Psychology at the University of New South Wales in 1973.  So she trained as a clinical psychologist and the relevant regulatory body, the Australian Health Practitioner Regulatory Agency, has no problem with her referring to herself in that way.  She has been referred multiple times to the relevant agencies, been investigated and cleared.  But Ms Arndt strongly denied allegations she has ever sought to intentionally mislead people about her profession.  Despite these denials, a new Matilda investigation can reveal Ms Arndt has actively participated in the promotion of material which portrays her falsely as a psychologist, clinical psychologist and doctor.  Now I'm not going to dismiss all of this because it can't be dismissed.  There is a bit of smoke here, but some of it is quite trivial.  For example, they dedicate a paragraph to examples where Aunt appeared on TV, and a chyron shows up under her name with the title psychologist or clinical psychologist.  Now she has no control over this, and when you're on a media blitz doing several shows in a day, often just for a couple of minutes, you can see how that title of what appears below your name is not going to be your top priority.  Could she have written to the show's editors after and corrected the record?  Sure, she could have done that, but what is her goal here?  It's to get her message out.  Then we get to the smoking gun, and this is not insignificant.  The blurb on the back cover of her 2009 book The Sex Diaries contains the following... Bettina Arndt is a clinical psychologist, sex therapist, and social commentator, and she draws on her 35 years of experience as a sex therapist and psychologist to provide a provocative analysis that challenges our basic assumptions about sex.  So this is... ",
