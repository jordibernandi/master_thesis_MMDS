            "text": "We are going to go over the reasons.  I became very sick after nearly eight years of following a carnivore diet.  Now, these are obviously things I realized after the fact, otherwise I wouldn't have stuck to the diet so long.  And if I had adhered to these principles, I should have been okay for a much longer period of time, certainly not feeling like I was on death's door.  I do still have my carnivore meal plan available, on frank-stefano.com if you sign up and that is pretty close to correct and far better than anything else I've seen.  If that's not enough you can check out the carnivore diet course as well but all of this information is available freely on my channel.  Overall I think a carnivore diet can be done if you were using indigenous cooking methods with the entire animal.  And I don't mean a bite of liver once per day, having a couple of organ pills.  The consumption of the entrails, especially intestines and organs that aren't typically accessible is what is key to nutrient balance.  Those are much higher in copper, antagonistic to zinc, which tends to be way too high on most carnivore muscle meat diets.  So unless you're gutting a sheep in your backyard, you'll have to do a few things differently and These are in order of typical occurrence on a carnivore diet journey, such as this will show up first, then this, then that, and finally nutrient imbalances.  So number one is low vitamin C. Although the carnivore diet does contain some vitamin C, and you certainly won't develop scurvy following it, the amount is nowhere near ideal.  without enough vitamin C you won't be able to optimize your antioxidant capacity.  you imagine you're getting all of these B vitamins from steak for glutathione.  your vitamin E is good and not oxidized because you're consuming high quality pasture-raised eggs grass-fed.
