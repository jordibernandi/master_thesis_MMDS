This is evidence.  Any action demanded which requires me to perform or submit to a court or tribunal or to pay a fine or be presented with a ticket or anything which has the potential or threat to deprive me of money, wealth, time or property is a transaction of a securitized interest.

Furthermore, and finally, I claim the law of agent and principal applies and that service upon one is service upon both.  Furthermore, I claim the right to deal with any counterclaims or disputes publicly and in an open forum using discussion and negotiation and to capture on videotape and audio tape as long as an end-sold beam is also present to verify the facts under common law for said discussion and negotiation for whatever lawful purposes I see fit.
