            "text": "Hello, my name is Hans Heinrich Himmler Goebbels Villalobos III Smith.  We moved the Smith to the end recently because English names are more prestigious nowadays.  I am an everyday, normal Latin American person from Latin American country X or perhaps even Latin American country Y. I am an authentic representation of the opinions of my people.  Mine people yearn for freedom.  We are ruled by a terrible, awful dictator.  Indio.  He's ruining our country.  You see, in the past, our country was rich and prosperous for all the right people.  But now everything is simply pure chaos.  He even took my father's slaves, um, um... Enthusiastic and loyal workers, I mean.  These days, a normal family like mine can only afford three live-in maids and two mayordomos.  They've simply taxed us too much and are stealing all of our money.  The economy is in free fall due to the terrible management of these disgusting, inferior, socialist, communist, narco traffickers.  Uh, one moment, please.  That's the stuff.  It's actually gotten so bad that my friend Hilda told me that there was an Indian child in her private German school.  Ugh!  They're simply being handed things they did nothing to earn.  Why, recently an Indian family even moved into our street.  And thanks to this terrible government, we can barely even afford the barbed wire that we need to keep our house safe from them.  I mean, what's next?  Are they going to seize our 5,000 acres of land?  Which were, of course, earned fair and square by my esteemed grandfather.  Hans, Villalobos, Heinrich, Himmler, Hitler, not a Nazi, the first.  We simply have no idea what these madmen will do next.  And I assure you that everyone else in my beloved homeland Latin American country X feels the same way.  Please, Mr.  President of the glorious United States of America, come to our aid.  You need our call, for I represent the authentic voice of our people.  If you don't send in the troops soon, Indians might even be able to go on holiday to Florida.  Imagine Indians in Disney World.  Disney World is no place for servants.  Nein!  It simply cannot be allowed to pass.  Send in the troops at once, Mr.  President.  I, Hans Himmler Goebbels Villalobos III Smith, the official president of Latin American country X, hereby officially proclaim that the people of our Lebensraum yearn for freedom.  Give it to us.  Give it to us now! ",
