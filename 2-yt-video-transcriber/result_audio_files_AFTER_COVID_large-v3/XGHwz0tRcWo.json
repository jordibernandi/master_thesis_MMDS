Media.  Boohoo, stop being mean to China.  China lied to the world two months ago, claiming there was no human-to-human transmission.  Media.  It's not China's fault.  Stop being mean to China.  Chinese laboratories identified a mystery virus as a highly infectious new pathogen by late December last year, but they were ordered to stop tests, destroy samples, and suppress the news.  Media.  It's not China's fault.  Stop being mean to China.  Americans.  I'm worried about the health of my family, my job security, making rent, and avoiding a recession.  Journalists.  Okay.  Journalists.  Journalists!  Trump said China virus again!  The virus was allowed to spread because China covered it up for over a month.  Even as the threat of a global pandemic loomed large, China threatened to withhold medical supplies, which they have a near monopoly over, from the United States.  China's foreign ministry spokesman suggested the US military was to blame for coronavirus.  This claim was then embraced by official Communist Party mouthpieces.  Media!  it's trump's fault. ",

Like what, next month is it gonna be racist to call it the coronavirus?  They're even going back and changing Wikipedia entries about the Spanish flu to try and claim it was never called the Spanish flu.  Still just one coronavirus death in Russia and zero in Singapore.  Two countries that closed their borders back in January.  Meanwhile, Germany, Denmark, Canada and numerous other countries are finally closing their borders two months later.  Too little, too late.  Compare the countries that imposed border controls early on to those that didn't.  Open borders spread viruses.  But from the very beginning, the World Health Organisation repeatedly ordered countries not to stop the sacred international flow of people.  Coronavirus, now in the UK because of the relentless mass movement of people, is apparently more important than stopping a global pandemic.  Oh look!  January!  And look where we are now.  People from Italy, Iran and China are still arriving in the UK.  No checks, nothing, allowed straight in.  90% of the COVID transmission in Seattle is from a single introduction in late January from China.  The New York intro is from Iran and San Diego intro from Europe.  The infection in Italy spread from two Chinese tourists who visited Rome.  The infection spread in Iran from Chinese migrant laborers.  Thanks, open borders.  Oh, fuck.  Back in February, the mayor of Florence came up with a brilliant plan to fight coronavirus.  Oh, my bad.  Not the virus.  The racism caused by the virus, which was obviously way more important.  He started a nationwide campaign encouraging Italians to hug Chinese people in the street in order to, quote, stem the hatred.  During one of the stunts to promote the campaign, Italians even physically removed the Chinese man's mask.  The idiot mayor also staged a photo op of himself hugging an awkward-looking Chinese man.  Plot twist!  Now Italy has the highest number of coronavirus deaths in the entire world.  They'll show this video to children in the future in history class about how political correctness killed an entire country.  Now they're not racist... Because they're dead.  The streets of Florence are now deserted.  Italy is under martial law lockdown.  But racism?  B.T.F.O.  Trudeau condemns racism linked to coronavirus outbreak.  Let me be clear. ",

Others reacted to being put under quarantine by waving ISIS flags and trying to burn down their own refugee camps.  And London's more diverse areas aren't really practicing good social distancing.  Oh my god!  Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit!  Oh, we just want to get our cereal!  We just want milk!  Oh my god!  Hashtag diversity is a strength.  Celebrities and social media influencers are some of the worst impacted by the coronavirus.  Not because they've got coronavirus, but because they're not getting enough attention.  Sam Smith is crying because he's had to self-isolate in his \u00a312 million mansion.  Poor baby.  There's also this weird kind of COVID signalling where people seem overly keen to claim that they've got the virus.  Catching a dangerous virus and then bragging about it doesn't make you hard, it makes you a fucking idiot.  But not as much of an idiot as this Future Darwin Award winner.  It's corona time.  Hey, it's corona time right now.  Coronavirus challenge, which involves licking a toilet seat or a doorknob.  Coronavirus BTFO.  That's like trying to defeat the spread of Hepatitis A by literally eating shit.  Some celebrities sang John Lennon's Imagine.  Imagine all the people living for today.  Coronavirus BTFO.  The irony of singing a song about open borders after a disease has killed thousands of people... Because of open borders, Hindu activists in the Indian capital of New Delhi held a party to celebrate finding a COVID cure.  The cure is to drink cow piss.  Coronavirus BTFO.  Millennials and college students reacted to desperate pleas to practice social distancing and avoid congregating in large groups by socializing in congregations of large groups.  If I get corona, I get corona.  At the end of the day, I'm not going to let it stop me from partying.  Like, it's really messing up with my spring break.  This virus ain't that serious.  Get drunk before everything closes.  We're having day parties all day.  We're just living for the moment.  City and countrywide quarantines, yeah, good luck with that.  But to be fair, adults are working from home.  No, they're congregating in huge numbers at the beach.  Teenagers are avoiding universities to get drunk at St.  Patrick's Day parties. ",

Billie Eilish pleaded with her fans to practice social distancing to stop coronavirus the day after she performed a concert to thousands of people and did this.  Yes!  What upset a lot of Americans more than the potential of millions of dead Americans was the possibility that their favorite sports ball tournament might get cancelled.  Today should have been a day of college basketball games and a few cold beers.  Instead, coronavirus stole it.  Imagine explaining to a D-Day veteran that sports were cancelled because of a virus.  Imagine explaining to that same veteran that you're whining on Twitter about not being able to watch a basketball game on TV.  But surely the biggest casualty of coronavirus in terms of postponed events was the cancellation of Drag Queen Storytime.  Every cloud.  Oh, bitch, you got coronavirus.  Oh, shit, you got coronavirus.  The stock market's totally collapsed.  No, not my stockerinos.  Wee, big line go down.  Which aside from Wall Street multimillionaires and billionaires, who'll probably be okay, could lead to retirement funds being wiped out, small businesses destroyed, global depression, and massive unemployment.  But according to leftists who are celebrating, that's okay because Orange Man bad.  Cringe Conservative Inc.  isn't reacting much better.  Shutting down private businesses is overreach.  Shutting down restaurants in a city of 4 million people is criminal.  There are hundreds of thousands of people who don't have food at home, who don't know how to cook.  Grocery stores aren't built to feed 100% of us 100% of the time.  Okay, okay, boom.  Drive-thru and Uber Eats cannot make up the difference.  People will not comply with this tyrannical shit once they get hungry.  Insanity!  No, not the hecking Restorinos.  I need my overpriced bugs.  I can't survive on my own.  No!  Don't panic, say all the big city LA and New York conservatives who are panicking because their favorite lobster restaurants are closing and they can't.  These are the same conservatives who quietly support mass immigration because they need cheap foreign labor ethnic minorities to prepare all their food.  Total man babies.  Only a complete idiot wouldn't have any food at home.  All these rugged individualist conservatives don't seem to be very rugged or individualist if they're one missed gourmet meal away from wetting the bed.  Coronavirus is a huge threat.
