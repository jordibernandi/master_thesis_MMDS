            "text": "Hello everybody.  In my last video I talked about the UBI and it attracted a bunch of centrists to my channel.  so I thought I would do the only natural thing and scare them off again by talking about a violent revolution to overthrow everything.  Oh and just as I was editing this I've been gaining a whole lot of eyeballs.  Hi guys, I hope you enjoyed this video.  I think on this channel we all agree that capitalism has more downsides than upsides and that the time has come to look at establishing a better system for us to live in.  How exactly that better system would look like is not yet clear enough for debate.  As it should be, we can't just pretend that our favorite system is flawless and that all others are bad.  That our system will fix literally every problem on earth with some niche mechanic which barely makes sense in theory.  We're socialists, not neoliberals.  So, how exactly a post-capitalist society would look like has yet to be established.  If you are curious on some of the options my series called ideology explained goes into a few of them.  But in this video we will not look at how the society after capitalism will work but at the question of how to get there in the first place.  The two main ways are reform and revolution.  Of course that's a simplification since both the anarchists and the Marxist Leninists might use revolution but they would go about it in very different ways.  But let's stick with the simplified version.  There are only reform and revolution.  Naturally I will have to speak about them quite broadly since your ideology or what you want the post-capitalist world to look like will have influence on how you go about establishing it.  If you are a syndicalist you will use different methods than an eco-marxist would.  In this video I will go over the ideas behind as well as the ups and downsides of both reform and revolution and at the end I will give you my opinion on the question and what I think the best thing to do right now would be.  Let's start with reform because alphabetically that one is first.  The biggest upside of reform is that it's relatively easy to do.  You can get yourself elected and begin to establish worker coops or to nationalize important industries.  That's a whole lot easier than somehow persuading thousands of people to join your leftist militia and then arming them and somehow defeating an actual standing army while being slandered as terrorists by, well, everyone.  The biggest advantage really is that it's legal.  You can run for election usually with whatever base you choose to go with.  Most of us live in neoliberal democracies which means that we theoretically have the freedom of speech and freedom of thought and expression.  I say theoretically because of course if let's say you form a socialist party and you want to use reform to establish worker coops or similar you will have a lot of trouble getting a message to the people.  Newspapers and TV shows may simply choose not to mention your party.  And that is of course because you're probably anti-big business so you won't take donations from the super rich and the big media corporations may dislike you since you might threaten their profits.  That means you have no advertisement budget and no free exposure.  Seems like a challenge.  But let's say you get over that and you get a whole lot of voters.  At some point your voters will expect you to do something.  If you get 40% of the votes what do you do?  Do you go into a coalition working with the other parties to have part in how the country is run?  It would allow you some power but you would have to make compromises with the other parties.  And if you don't you may lose voters since they would prefer to vote for a party that actually governs when it has the chance.  That's an important decision.  Do you work with the neoliberal parties?  And one more added, do you fuse a party with similar socialist parties?  That way you could create a unified leftist party like the Socialist Unity Party of Germany which was in power in the German Democratic Republic.  How will you deal with the far right parties that get funded by the rich elites as they are afraid of losing their privilege?  Those are questions you need to deal with, questions that can be answered but not easy questions.  In the end you will have to achieve change but that's actually harder than it seems.  For the kind of big structural changes we want to achieve you will not only have to change a few laws, you will need to change the structure, the foundations of a country, the constitution.  If you reach let's say 60% of the votes that may still not be enough depending on where you are.  For example in Austria you would need a simple majority to write regular laws like fucking off unemployment benefits or reintroducing the 12 hour workday.  But if you want to change the constitution you need a two thirds majority.  In the US the constitution straight up can't be changed, only amended.  And if you ever get as much as the thought.  to touch the second amendment you will have half of the country trying to assassinate you.  You could say that an armed populace is good since it prevents a government from becoming tyrannical and yeah that's a fair point.  But just keep in mind that an armed populace is a two sided blade and the same guns might allow the workers to defend the means of production or fascists to murder minorities.  And since we are on the side of reformism right now we will take the stance of the states which is that an armed populace is pretty dangerous.  Just imagine what a bunch of angry trumpists would do if they feared that you might want to collectivize the farm their grandparents built on stolen Indian land.  It would probably be just as ugly as the time Stalin tried to remove the kulaks from their land.  But Stalin is not the topic here.  My point was that it is extremely hard to gain the popular support you would need to get a sizeable enough majority to change the very foundations of a country.  Hell, the UK doesn't even have a constitution to change.  And even worse, let's say you take power in Austria.  You'd still not be able to change anything since the European Union controls Austrian economic policy, not Austria.  If you as much as try to touch private property your country will be completely destroyed by tariffs and because of the 4 freedoms of the EU you can't even confiscate the property of emigrants which is one of the things the communist manifesto said.  The same is true for all EU nations, we can't do anything if we don't fundamentally change the way the European Union works.  And if you now think that going Brexit is the solution and that everyone should just abandon the EU I have another negative surprise for you.  The World Trade Organization is just as capitalist as the EU.  If your country is in violation of what they consider to be the correct property laws you will pay for it.  They will mess up your credibility and if your country ever needs to borrow anything as it happens if you industrialize or modernize or do anything to improve the country then they will make you pay interests you cannot afford.  That's why countries like Venezuela have such a shit time.  The world trade organization tries to fuck them over until they turn capitalist again.  North Korea is basically being embargoed by the entire world right now.  They can't import or export anything.  That's why life in the DPRK is so shitty.  They have to make everything themselves.  Cars, trains, guns, roads, buildings, TVs, mobile phones, everything there has to be made in North Korea.  And not to insult Koreans.  but Korea just isn't known for making good cars.  Cars are made in Germany, electronics are made in Japan, oil comes from Arabia and crippling medical debt comes from the US.  That's how our modern world works.  The world is specialized.  No country can produce everything to the same standard as the entire global economy.  This means getting cut off from the world.  trade means a lot of problems and eventually your country might just end up like North Korea.  But let's ignore that for now, let's go back to the elections.  At some point before you take power you will have to take part in a usual democratic statesmanship.  Holding speeches, collecting donations, building understanding of what you stand for, putting out ads, stuff like that.  And all that time you will be visited by lobbyists and influencers trying to get you on their side, offering you all the money you'd ever need if only you supported policy x, y and z. And you might think, yeah, I do need the money to buy adverts to eventually reach the revolution.  Why not take a little donation now?  Why not use it to advance the cause?  After all, as long as it helps the people in the long run.  it can't be that bad, right?  Of course you wouldn't do that.  I wouldn't either.  But how many times could you say no?  And how long could you watch the polls stagnate before you would reconsider that?  After all, everyone is corrupt in politics and at least your corruption might eventually change the system.  As you can see corruption is easy to form in politics, it's a very big problem in all parties of all countries and that's provided you don't just get kicked out by a US backed fascist coup which tends to happen a lot for some reason.  and even if not your people can just get rid of you.  Let's say you make an unpopular land reform which would help in the long run.  All it takes for you to be removed from office is a few weeks of bad press before an election.  And then what?  The people will vote in a neoliberal who will reverse their changes.  Or even worse, a corporate backed fascist who will make sure you don't get elected again.  Let me recap.  The advantages of reform is that it's easy and realistic and most importantly legal.  This makes it a good tool for people who want to achieve socialism without putting much effort into it.  You just put your cross in the right place every four years or so and you've done your part and can feel good about yourself.  Not that I want to trash talk people like that, after all that's sort of what I've been doing.  But there are downsides, many many downsides.  One can just be trouble getting funding or exposure, getting cooed by the USA, corruption, international sanctions, having to work with neoliberals, balancing the needs of the revolution with the desire to get re-elected.  Those are a lot of downsides and this might make me seem biased.  Which would be fair complaint.  Maybe I'm just better at finding problems than solutions.  Now let us turn to revolution to see if that's easier.  Revolution for our purposes is a radical overthrow of the state.  I will speak in general because I want to cover both anarchist revolutions like syndicalism and maoist or leninist revolutions which aren't quite as anarchist.  Let's start with the advantages.  You can build up a state out of nothing.  You don't need to worry.  if the constitution allows collectivization, you can just write one that does.  You don't have to worry about bourgeois parties getting elected in your place because you can just ban them for being counterrevolutionaries.  But you can't have a dictatorship of the proletariat without banning a few bourgeois parties, can you?  After all, their interests are opposed to the interests of the people, so it can be seen as moral to remove them from the government.  And this way you can have basically free reign, which can be pretty good, provided that you, as a genuine revolutionary, only want the best for the people and you do not need to put checks and balances in place.  Why have a high court decide if your law is good?  You already know it helps the people.  If it didn't you wouldn't have proposed it, would you?  And if you are worried of people having that much power you can just build up a cynicalist confederation instead without leaders at all.  My point is that after a revolution the state can be whatever you want it to be.  Hell, there could be no state.  You don't have to inherit a country that has been around for a few hundred years and which has antiquated amendments to its constitution.  you can just build up a new state.  But of course there are downsides.  One is that it's illegal.  If you say that you want to overthrow the government you will probably have the police knocking on your door in a short time.  So please remember that while we may talk about revolution in theory, because of free speech, as soon as you begin to stash guns.  it might or might not be illegal depending on where you live.  Just be careful.  And that's only the beginning of the downsides.  The next is that a revolution needs popular support.  If you want to know what happens to a revolution slash coup that doesn't have popular support look at what happened to the red army coup at the end of the soviet union.  It was stopped in its tracks by the people of Moscow blocking the streets.  So, you somehow need to get the people on your side so they will support or at least ignore your revolution.  And of course you will need many people to fight for you, be it soldiers in a 1917 style revolutionary army or be it unionized workers who are ready to be shot for the rights.  You need people and you need them to be loyal and not just jump ship after the bullets begin to fly.  And the next problem is, how do you arm them?  This might be easier or harder depending on where you live.  If you live in the USA you can buy assault style weapons with surprising ease, while in Germany it's a bureaucratic nightmare.  You could use party funds or require soldiers to arm themselves.  But of course assault rifles are quite useless against modern fighter jets and M1 Abrams.  So you will need to get some heavy weapons.  How do you get them?  I don't know, you could buy them from the capitalists with money you got from... I don't know, somewhere.  Or you could say screw this and go for a guerrilla war like in Vietnam or Afghanistan, both of which seem to have defeated the US so far.  But if that's your plan you have to consider the unique geography of those places.  It's easy to hide in an Afghan cave or a Vietnamese jungle but it's a lot harder to do that in the English midlands or in Kansas.  On top of that there is the trouble of organizing an army like that.  You need to muster a huge army on a national level to even stand a chance at revolution and at defeating the old order, you could do it decentrally and hope it works out or you could organize them in a more traditional army hierarchy.  Though if you do that you need to figure out how to train all of those privates and corporals and sergeants and staff sergeants and master sergeants and so on.  And of course as I talked about in my video what fascism is.  capitalism in decay means, you will probably have to face a fascist reaction from other countries if your revolution only takes place inside one country.  And that's on top of the international organisations like the EU and the WTO fucking over your economy with tariffs.  If you are unlucky NATO might attack you as well.  All of those things mean that revolution sort of has to happen globally.  If it doesn't happen everywhere the bourgeoisie of the other countries will simply turn to fascism to destroy the revolution again.  And I haven't even started with how corruption can form just as well if you are the head of a revolution.  It has happened many times.  And what if you lead a revolution with the best of intentions and someone with less good intentions takes over?  What is to say that you don't slide into authoritarianism or even fascism?  Centralizing power opens the door for things like that.  So, to recap, revolution has the advantage that it allows us to more or less directly implement the changes we want to implement.  But it has many downsides.  The international community will stand against you, you will face sanctions, you will need to organize it.  You need to arm the people, you need to somehow win against the united neoliberal armies of the world and you need to overcome the possibility of corruption and temptations of power.  So now that we've gone over the ups and downsides of reform and revolution.  I think it's time that I say what I think is the best way to go forward.  As Richard DeWolf puts it in his video on the topic, it's always mixed.  You might think you are preparing for a revolution but causing reform in the process.  For example for a revolution you might need looser gun laws.  To achieve that you need to reform the laws.  And if you want to achieve reform you need to build understanding about what socialism is and why we need it.  And that may very well inspire the people to take part in a revolution.  Reform and revolution go hand in hand and you can't just pick one to support.  It's always both of them.  Keeping that in mind I think that the better way, at least right now, is reform.  There are many reasons, main one is that it's easier but the most important one is that there is basically no support for socialism right now and for a revolution.  we need the people to support us.  The best way to do that is to form parties within neoliberal states and to do advertisements and hold speeches.  Tell the people that a better world is possible and get them on your side.  For that reason I joined the Wandel.  It's an Austrian socialist party that pretty much uses no socialist lingo.  If you're from Austria my advice is to vote for them and tell everyone else you know to do the same thing.  Right now we from the Wandel suffer from the reformist problems I talked about before.  We get no TV interviews, we get ignored by the newspapers and we didn't even get invited to the national debates before the election.  And on top of that the party is extremely low on money since all the money they get is raised by individuals.  We take no donations from corporations or the rich which means that we can't afford adverts which means we have fewer members which means we reach fewer people who might donate.  You see, reform is very tough to achieve and it's a lot of work.  And even right now in making this video my goal is to attract more people to my channel so that socialist ideas may be spread further.  That's the ultimate goal I try to achieve.  But don't get me wrong, I'm under no illusion.  I know that reform is extremely limited.  I like to put it this way.  Our state is sort of like a sandbox.  You can play in it all you want, you can change laws and play around with taxes, but that's it.  If you want to break out of the box and achieve change other than what it allows you will need a revolution.  So I guess you could say that I would prefer reform if just to avert the bloodshed.  But I am afraid that neoliberal democracies just aren't built in a way that allows that kind of changes we need at this point.  And maybe the next economic crisis will turn millions into socialists and maybe it will bring about the conditions that allow a revolution.  But right now the conditions aren't ripe, so I think we should be flexible, work on spreading socialism and waiting for the right conditions for a revolution to come about.  Though I don't just expect it to come upon its own.  As Che Guevara put it, the revolution is not an apple that falls.  when it's ripe, it must be brought to fall.  So I guess we do what we can to make it fall as soon as possible.  And for now that means biding our time and educating the people.
