            "text": "As a man, you are a wallet.  You're an ATM.  You're a cash card.  You're a cash cow.  A whale, if you will.  You're there just to provide.  To give a woman money.  Give a woman money for companionship.  Give a woman money to fake the funk.  To fake the love.  And to give you some funk.  indeed you see the point is sugar daddies and the sugar babies.  but my point is not just the topic it's my added point of view of.  but what happens to the sugar babies when they're no longer young enough to be sugar babies?  no one cares.  i mean for the most part the perspective is a younger attractive woman who's offering her time up to, for the most part, a older man, more moneyed, well-off older man, who may not be the most attractive, but he has money.  And he's able to offer her a lifestyle, you know?  Like a proper garden tool.  Proper garden tool.  Indeed.  But my point of view is, but what happens to those women?  When they can no longer play the game.  When they can no longer play a trick to get a treat.  What happens to those women?  Do they become left over?  Xiong knew.  Because their career was a man.  Their lifestyle, their money was from a man.  They may have had the odd few job.  Little, little job here and there.  But their main income or a large amount of their income was from a man.  A grown man with a lot of sugar to give her.  Now, amongst my waffle, I do have a video to show you.  I will show you shortly, a very short video anyway, and I will add a little bit to obviously extend the video.  But let me add this last point before we begin.  But what about the men that may try to date a woman who's used to dating sugar daddies?  Understand this, he's approaching her in the normal, yeah, normal, regular sense, yeah?  Like what everyone talks about, normal.  Bullshit.  Yeah, okay.  He's approaching her in the normal, regular sense.  Except the fact is, she's expecting more.  She's expecting the sugar daddy lifestyle.  Proper garden tool.  And a final strand to this.  is as i've shown you in articles and various videos i can find you more videos if you want to see them for some women by their own choice they kind of have nothing more than f boys for most of their life rather than actual boyfriends.  they may just have a lot of f boys but never have the full boyfriend experience.  Basically a man that's just there to give them the D, basically.  Here, here.  Woof, woof.  As men, yeah.  And that may be all she wants.  But imagine a woman doing that with sugar daddies.  Becoming so used to these sorts of men.  How the hell could any regular sort of man, any normal, decent man, try to date a woman who's used to dating sugar daddies?  Am I wrong in saying that?  Or does it paint a dark... Yes, and quite hilarious picture.  Quite morbid picture.  The onus is always on men, but more women should pay attention to the fact that you could be the one that's undateable.  You're the one with the problems.  You're the one that makes men run.  It's not because of them.  It's because of you.  The lifestyle you had before makes you an undateable woman in the future.  Her wife got problems.  Does it?  But enough waffling.  This, of course, is Replicant Fish, the obviously exquisite bastard.  Incredible, awesome bastard, you know.  What?  But enough hype, enough hype.  Hope you're doing well.  Hope you've had a good weekend.  This one should be interesting.  And I think many of you will have good points to this one as well.  But enough waffling.  Let's begin.  Good God, let's begin. ",

And she's only 22 is the point.  What happens at 32?  Then my point is, how can any regular man come along and want to and should date her?  Focus.  Observe.  Remember.  The world is yours.
