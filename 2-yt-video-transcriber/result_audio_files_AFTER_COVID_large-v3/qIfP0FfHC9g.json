            "text": "If this pandemic has taught us anything, it is to be prepared for the unexpected, to anticipate risks before they metastasize so that we can protect ourselves and we can secure our future.  And so today I rise in the House of Commons to draw the attention of members to a growing risk of danger to our families, to our businesses, and to our entire country.  And it is the risk of the $8.6 trillion of household, corporate, and government debt that is quickly accumulating on the shoulders of Canadians.  This amount equals 387% of our GDP, a record ratio higher than the ratios in many countries that have in the past experienced devastating debt crises.  Before our eyes glaze over, though, I want to remind members that a debt crisis is not just something that bankers and financial analysts talk about on the report on business or on BNN.  Research by reputable academic institutions show that in the case of financial crisis, house prices can drop by a third, stock markets, meaning people's savings, by half, the economy by 9% and unemployment can rise 7 percentage points.  Now here's the human toll of that.  University of Calgary published a study recently showing that there's a 2 percentage point increase in suicides for every 1 percentage point increase in unemployment.  Imagine the human cost of losing 7% unemployment then.  More data is now showing an inextricable link between opioid abuse and unemployment.  Depression and homelessness result from these types of crises.  So what is the nature of the risk?  How serious is it?  How likely are we to face it?  Well, we have to look to history.  In their now legendary book, This Time is Different, our Harvard economists, Carmen Reinhart and Professor Ken Rogoff, wrote about what they called eight centuries of folly.  They studied debt crises in 66 countries across five continents.  They write in their opening, each time the experts chime, this time is different, claiming that the old rules of valuation no longer apply and that the new situation bears little similarity to the past disasters.  With this breakthrough study, we have found definitively that they are wrong.  Now, They lay out five standard leading indicators for a forthcoming financial crisis.  I will go through them very quickly.  First, falling economic output.  Second, a large debt build-up.  Third, rising household leverage.  Fourth, asset inflation.  And fifth, large current account deficits.  So, do these five standard leading indicators apply to us?  Let's start with the first one, falling output.  Last year in 2020, our GDP dropped 5.5%, blowing a more than $100 billion hole in our economy.  That is a massive reduction in our economy, and it means we have $100 billion less to service our debts.  So on the first test, from this time is different, check.  We do have falling economic output.  It doesn't matter who's to blame.  It doesn't matter that it was COVID that caused it.  What matters is the math, and the math does not lie.  So let's move on to the second standard leading indicator, and that is debt buildup.  Now, the amount of debt that a country can shoulder depends on the income that it produces to service that debt.  According to the great Canadian economist John Kenneth Galbraith, and I quote, \"...all crises have involved debt that, in one fashion or another, has become dangerously out of scale in relation to the underlying means of  payment.\".  That underlying means of payment, of course, is GDP.  So let's look at the size of our debt and how much it has grown.  Since the beginning of 2015, our total debt, public and private, has gone from $6.1 trillion to $8.5 trillion, a nearly 40% increase in our debt.  During that time, our GDP has only grown by 13%.  In other words, our debt levels are growing almost three times as fast as our GDP, the underlying means of payment.  We've now reached a level of debt to GDP of 387%, which I said earlier, but I didn't tell you that that is an all-time record and nearly twice the size of the typical ratio over the last 60 years in Canada.  And here's some more staggering information.  The debt-to-GDP ratio in Greece when it had its massive sovereign debt crisis 10 years ago was 330%.  In the United States during the great financial crisis that came out of the mortgage bubble, their debt was 375% of GDP.  In other words, our debt levels in Canada today are higher than they were in the United States and Greece when they had massive, iconic and devastating debt crises in the recent past.  And so we need now to pay heed as to why we think we can avoid the same fate.  The only difference between them then and us now is that interest rates are low, but that won't stay that way forever.  So what is the composition of our debt?  Where does it come from?  Well, the answer is threefold.  Government, corporate, and household.  Let's start with government.  This year, for the first time on record, Statistics Canada shows that the gross debt of all levels of government in Canada is bigger than GDP.  It just exceeded 100%.  100.3%, to be precise, in the third quarter of 2020.  That has never happened before.  We are higher than we were in the 1990s when we had our own miniature near default of the federal government.  That time it was 92%.  So our debt levels are higher than ever before when it comes to government.  And before they rise and claim that we have the lowest debt in the G7 as a share of GDP, that is just wrong.  The only reason that Finance Canada calculates it that way is because they use the assets in the CPP and the QPP to deduct from our overall net debt without using the corresponding liabilities that those funds must pay.  And as a result, if you ignore those and look at our gross debt, we have higher debt levels than both Germany, and I believe it's also France in the G7.  So that means we are not the lowest, and we cannot be worry-free in fooling ourselves that our sustained build-up of government debt is not a problem.  And this year has seen a spectacular and never before seen increase in that debt.  Our deficit is $381 billion.  That's almost seven times bigger than the previous all-time average, and it equals 17% of our GDP.  Now, let's put that into perspective.  In World War I, our deficit to GDP was 8%.  In the Great Depression, it was 6%.  In the Great Global Recession, it was 4%.  In other words, our deficit as a share of the economy adjusted for inflation is currently twice what it was at its peak in World War I, three times what it was at its peak in the Great Depression.  and four times what it was in the Great Global Recession.  Only in the Second World War was it bigger, and our ancestors, when they came back from war, immediately began repaying that debt, running the biggest surpluses ever in 1947, and then increasing the size of our economy 11-fold in the two and a half decades that followed.  that allowed them to pay it off quickly.  Nobody is suggesting that we will come anywhere near to those kinds of surpluses or growth levels in the post-COVID era, which means our debt situation is arguably more ominous to the country than it was even back then.  So, on that criteria, the second standard leading indicator, a sustained buildup of debt, check.  Canada meets that as well.  We move on to household debt levels.  Canada has the highest level of household debt as a ratio of disposable income in the G7.  In fact, recently, our level of household debt grew to bigger than the entire Canadian economy.  Again, setting records.  These ratios mean that our households are carrying more debt than our economy can reasonably be expected to support.  According to the President and CEO of CMHC, I'm going to quote here, Canadians are among world leaders in household debt.  Pre-COVID, the ratio of debt to GDP for Canada was at 99%.  These ratios are well in excess of the 80% threshold above which the Bank of International Settlements has shown that national debt intensifies the drag on GDP growth.  In other words, an international body like the Bank of International Settlements says don't go above 80%, and now, pre-COVID, we were at nearly 100%.  Since that time, debt levels have risen even higher.  So that is the third criteria for a forthcoming debt crisis, rising household leverage.  Check.  So now we move on to the next one, which is asset inflation.  Well, in Canada today, the assets that Canadians own in the country are worth 17 times the size of the Canadian economy.  The historic average is 12 times.  In other words, our asset values are quickly outpacing our economy.  That's something that can't go on for long because, of course, assets can only be purchased out of the income that is generated in the economy.  And so those assets break down into two parts, financial assets and real estate assets, more or less.  Financial assets.  You look at this S&P TSX, which is the broadest index in the country.  Until a few years ago, the market value of that index had never exceeded the size of our economy.  It was always smaller than GDP.  That changed in the last 24 months and suddenly rocketed up to 120%, according to Rosenberg & Associates, a leading economic research firm.  So that one index is now worth 120% of GDP.  That has never happened before.  The companies on that index need to generate their profits from the economy.  Therefore, the value of the stocks on the index cannot get completely out of touch with the ability of the economy to generate income and support those stock prices.  Then you move to real estate, where prices are up $65,000 this year.  Can you imagine, Madam Chair, that in a year where our economy has lost over $100 billion of economic output, where hundreds of thousands of people have lost their paychecks and been forced into their homes, that somehow we found all this money to buy real estate.  In fact, in the year from the beginning of 2019 to mid-2020, the inflation of our assets in this country has been worth more than our entire economy.  $2.7 trillion of asset inflation in an economy worth just over $2 trillion.  That would be like every year making more money from the appreciation of your house than from the salary you take home from work.  It would be nice if it could happen forever, if we could float simply on a bubble up to prosperity.  But we know that in the end, our assets are only worth what we can afford to pay for them.  So can the Canadians afford the real estate they have right now?  Well, ask RBC.  And ask the CMHC.  CMHC says for a home to be affordable for a family, they shouldn't have to spend more than 30% of their income on housing.  According to RBC, the average right now is 50%.  So we're 20 percentage points more from family budgets have to go to housing to afford the houses that we live in.  For the average person to afford the average house.  And that, Madam Speaker, is with record low interest rates.  Those payments will only become more expensive when rates rise.  So do we have asset inflation in Canada?  We have it like we perhaps have never seen before.  So the fourth leading indicator of a forthcoming debt crisis, asset inflation, check.  Which brings us to the final leading indicator that these Harvard economists developed through 800 years of history of debt crises, and that is current account deficits.  Now current account deficits are basically, to oversimplify for the purpose of saving time, the amount you buy in excess of what you sell.  So in essence, Canada buys and sells imports and exports.  The truth is that we buy a lot more than we sell from the rest of the world.  Since 2015 to present, Canada has run current account deficits of approximately $300 billion.  In other words, we bought $300 billion more from the world than we sold to the world, and we borrowed to make up the difference.  How else do you do it?  If you're buying more than you're selling, there's only two ways to do it.  You drain your savings or you rack up debt.  We've been doing a little bit of both, but most of all, we've been adding debt.  And the result is that we are taking on more and more obligations for our prior consumption.  Now, I would like to tell you that all of this debt has been used to invest in productive assets like factories and software and patents and other things that will generate income to pay off that debt, but the evidence shows that the overwhelming preponderance of the new debt has been going to immediate consumption.  In fact, data that came out after the government's programs came in, programs that I believe were meritorious and had to happen, show that much of the money leaked out of the country because we, as Canadians, we were all buying things that are imported from abroad.  more than we were producing and sending to abroad.  That means we are, this year again, running a large trade deficit and adding to our overall debt load in the process.  In the months April and May of this year, Canadians borrowed an extra $80 billion from foreigners.  according to David Dodge, who published a recent piece on this in Public Policy Options.  He specifically asked the question of how long it is going to be possible for Canadians, for our country, to borrow from the world in order to buy from the world before the world gets tired of lending us money.  But the bottom line is we have a large and consistent current account deficit, the second largest in the G7, second only to Japan.  And that is an unavoidable problem that we will need to confront because the world is not going to view our economy as a charity case.  The lenders of the world will expect to be paid interest on all of the debt that we carry forward.  In fact, Madam Speaker, the only way to pay off that debt is to generate powerful incomes.  Unfortunately, since 2012, Canada has seen has exported more investment than it has brought in by a net amount of $800 billion.  In other words, we are sending our investment to productive assets in other parts of the world while they are sending us debt.  They get factories, software, patents, pipelines.  We get large-scale debt.  So that is the fifth measurement of whether or not a debt crisis will strike.  And we can say definitively, with five years equaling $300 billion of current account deficits, that Canada indeed meets the standard leading indicator of large current deficits that is necessary to trigger a debt crisis.  So five indicators, and we check every single box, Madam Speaker.  So what can we do about it?  The answer is that we need to unleash the power of our productive economy.  to clear the way for job creation.  This is Red Tape Week.  Let's eliminate the red tape that prevents businesses from hiring.  Let's approve large-scale projects like the Tech Frontier Mine in Alberta or the LNG facility in Saguenay.  These are tens of billions of dollars of economic activity.  Let's make this the fastest place in the world to get a construction permit.  Right now we rank 34th out of 35 OECD nations.  Let's be the fastest place to build a factory or to build a pipeline or some other economic infrastructure that pays wages and can reimburse our debts and support our prosperity.  Let's change the tax and regulatory rules that get in the way of First Nations communities who are trying to develop commerce and resources on their reserves.  Let us remove the penalties for low-income people who get off social assistance so that they can get back to work.  Let's allow our newcomers as immigrants to use their qualifications by giving them permits to work in fields for which they are qualified, like the professions and the trades.  Let us replace what has become a credit card economy with a paycheck economy.  And in that way alone, we will secure our future.  Thank you. ",
