            "text": "So the thing is, the gate?  We can record that gate.  You got authorization?  No, I got the Constitution as my authorization.  Constitution?  Yeah.  All right, guys, right here on the side of the road, that's the Fort Bragg gate right there.  It's a cured gate.  that goes on the Fort Bragg Air Force Base.  We're gonna see if they have a problem with us out here in public filming the gate.  Military police.  Oh shit, I'm zoomed out too far.  I don't know.  I don't know.  They can eat it though.  I don't care.  I don't care what they are.  Got the military police out here, guys.  We on Fort Bragg, or close to Fort Bragg.  We're not even on Fort Bragg.  We're just close.  How's it going, y'all?  What are y'all doing?  What does it look like we're doing?  Filming.  There you go.  There you go.  You got it.  I don't want to know, like, why.  Just because there's just... Like, y'all can do whatever you want to do, but on Fort Bragg, since the government... We're not on Fort Bragg.  No, but y'all are pointing the cameras.  Absolutely.  We're absolutely filming that gate.  Yes.  Absolutely.  And we're going to be filming it for a while.  But that's not allowed.  It's not allowed.  Tell me the statute.  Um, my boss is out here right now.  I don't know what I'm talking about.  Okay, well, I'd suggest you get him because you don't know what you're talking about.  He's coming, but on a federal installation.  Federal installation.  We're not on federal installation.  But you're pointing towards it.  Absolutely, I'm pointing my camera towards it.  You tell me why I can't point it over there.  Because it's a federal installation.  So you can't film.  no federal installations.  You need to brush up on that because you're absolutely wrong.  Not unless it's otherwise posted.  You know about photography?  Come on.  Really?  Shouldn't you to look that up before you come out here bothering us civilians?  I'm just, honestly, I'm just here to make sure you're not causing a problem.  I'm honestly just here.  Do we look like we're causing a problem?  No, not at all.  Okay, thank you.  Not at all.  I honestly have no problem with what you're doing.  Okay, thank you.  It's just people are complaining.  That's their right.  They can complain.  Of course.  That's why I'm just here because this is overall like my area.  No, no, you got a bad, you drew the bad straw.  Thank goodness you have me.  Yeah, hey, you chose the bad straw today.  You got the wrong straw today.  But listen, we absolutely can film that gate from where we're standing right here.  Absolutely, 100%.  So you're going to get a lesson today.  You're going to be educated today, and that's good.  That's why we do this.  Hey, I'm just here until my boss gets here.  Okay, that's fine.  I'm not trying to give you a hard time, right?  I feel like I'm famous.  Yeah, you will be.  You're going to defend the Constitution, correct?  Of course.  As I did.  Do you see your sign?  Yeah, the security camera's in use right now.  I'll look it up now, I guess.  That's what it looks like.  But it looked like they would have looked it up before they came out here.  I don't get that.  Here comes another one.  Oh, Lord, here comes a lot.  Wow.  I'd say that was a little overkill, wasn't y'all?  Damn, here comes some more.  Jesus Christ.  What the hell?  Hey, how you doing, gentlemen?  Yeah, man, what's up?  What, did we, is this really necessary?  Yeah, you're not allowed to record a federal installation.  How you figure that out?  Show me where it says that.  How about I'm going to record it regardless of what you say?  You gave it up to defend the Constitution, right?  You gave it up to defend the Constitution, right?  Hang on, we're not on military property.  Yeah, you're recording a federal installation.  Absolutely, I absolutely am.  Absolutely can do that.  I suggest you look it up.  About public photography?  Do you have that on you right now?  No, but I ain't doing your job for you.  Are you serious?  Do you guys have ID?  You're not getting no ID.  That's funny.  That's funny, dude.  That's funny.  I doubt it.  I doubt it.  Do you guys have ID?  You're not getting no ID.  That's funny.  That's funny, dude.  That's funny.  I doubt it.  You're going to get me for what now?  There's no identified statue in North Carolina.  Are you serious?  Can I get your name?  No, you can't.  You can't bullshit us, dude.  We know what we're doing.  We know what we're doing.  How do you want me to address you?  You can call me good citizen.  What's the crime you're charging us with?  I want to know why.  he's asking for my ID and telling me to put my hands behind my back.  He's got his hand on his weapon.  It's not on my weapon.  I'm pressing my hand.  All right, let's start over.  Let's start over.  You talk to us because you look like you know what you're talking about.  He don't.  What's the purpose for you guys to be here?  We're just out here enjoying this beautiful day.  We're journalists.  That's what we do.  So the thing is, the gate?  We can record that gate.  You've got authorization?  No, I've got the Constitution as my authorization.  That's a federal installation.  I'll have the watch commander come out here in a second.  He needs to because this guy right here is fixing to do something very stupid.  That guy.  This guy.  Green, yes.  All right, all right.  Talking about ID and arresting me for not IDing.  Are you serious?  I didn't get much sleep, bro.  Okay.  Is that why you're cranky today?  Trying to arrest somebody for failing to ID when there's no such statue?  There's no such statue.  This is me calling.  But there's no such statue.  You're going to take someone to jail for failing to ID, huh?  You're not allowed to give your ID as military.  We have to provide our IDs to any incident.  Right, but he knows that now.  You need to school him.  Right, exactly.  You need to school him, and we can absolutely film that gate from where we're at on public property.  I don't know about that.  I do.  Federal installation, you're not allowed to film it?  We go around.  You're not allowed to film access control points?  Yes, we can.  For federal installation?  We can.  And listen, guys, we can't even see what's going on over there, do you?  You see how far we are?  Why do you want to?  Because we can.  To make y'all aware that we can do this.  Education.  First Amendment education.  Exactly.  You should give an oath to defend the Constitution, right?  What's the First Amendment of the Constitution?  I can't hear you.  No, this is so you learn something.  Is that for all of you guys?  I mean, you can laugh it off if you want to, but this is educational.  Have you learned anything yet?  Okay.  I mean, that's cool at least.  It used to be willing to... You know, acknowledge the way that everything happened, especially the green over here.  He must be his first day on the job.  So it's kind of like I've seen videos on YouTube like this.  Okay.  Very similar.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  There you go.  I mean, it makes sense.  I mean, I kind of understand why you're doing it.  We're trying to educate.  You're testing limits, right?  Right.  There you go.  You're testing limits.  I get that.  Without being an asshole, that's exactly right.  Okay, you're testing limits.  So you gave an oath to defend the Constitution.  But you're out here trying to tell us we're not allowed to do a First Amendment protected activity.  All right.  That's great.  I hope he knows.  See, I don't understand how you come on.  You want to arrest me for failure to ID and there ain't no such statute.  I'm not military.  I'm not on your base either, right?  Hey, don't worry about it.  Yeah, Green, don't worry about it, man.  I hope you learned something today.  He just came out to Trump all over our rights.  Green, I hope you learned something valuable today, cuz.  Green came out to Trump all over our rights.  Hey, I'm allowed to talk too.  Yeah.  Right?  Yeah, Green.  I'm a civilian.  I can stand right here all day.  Listen, Mr.  Green went to Trump all over our rights.  Simple as that.  Yeah, that's all he wanted to do.  It is a little cool.  A little cool.  You need to get a little of a blubber on you like me.  Next time.  You won't have any issues.  I got to get my phone.  I'm fixing to go live.  All right, y'all say hey to YouTube.  Now y'all being live streamed.  And your gate is.  Thought y'all should know.  Officer Green here.  Tyrant.  Trying to arrest me for failure to ID.  Tyrant.  which is really ridiculous.  this guy right here that guy right there this one over here she was actually nice.  i don't remember her name she's okay.  she was actually nice.  when she come up specialist herb herb.  yes specialist herb there you go.  um they they said we can't.  uh they can't.  we can't be here on public property filming the installation.  um green here threatened to arrest me told me to put my hands behind my back said he was going to arrest me for failure to id which is a joke absolute joke.  got these over here.  yeah this guy this guy here's a clown.  He walked up to me and said I was under arrest for failure to ID in North Carolina.  Wow.  I ain't never.  You know what?  In all my years, I've never had any military person come up to me and said, you're under arrest for failure to ID.  Really, dude?  I mean, you just start.  How long have you been in the military?  He doesn't know.  Four years and... He doesn't know.  Four years.  We're gonna say four years and something.  Uh, damn.  Let's just say too long to come up with an actual term.  We're not on Fort Bragg, Green.  You should know that, man.  I told you that.  We on public property.  He's still gonna stay here and shut up.  Yeah, his arrogance is unbelievable.  I get that a lot.  Look at what we got here, just for photographers on the side of the road.  One, two, three, four, five.  We got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.  Eight military guys.  That's crazy.  Absolutely insane.  I can't believe you did that, Green.  Do you know the law on public photography on public property when it comes to military bases?  As far as I'm aware, we're trying to verify if this is still technically Fort Bragg's property.  It's not.  We already checked.  We checked.  It's actually close to that pole.  Yeah, it's across that pole right there.  Pretty much.  And y'all, if this is Fort Bragg property, y'all supposed to have it marked.  Clearly marked, that is.  Yep.  So that's something else maybe y'all could do, right?  I mean, like I said, this is about education.  But when Green come up here threatening to arrest me for not identifying, my switch went off to good guy.  Good guy's gone.  You know what I'm saying?  But really, I mean, like I said, this is about education, right?  So now he'll know.  He got educated, at least on that part.  Correct?  That's all we're trying to do.  Right?  We're not trying to cause no havoc or none of that stuff, man.  We actually want to be left alone.  Technically.  Because if y'all wouldn't have come out here, we'd have probably been out here five more minutes, ten max, and we'd have drove off.  And said, hey, them guys know what they're doing.  Right?  I'm not trying to make you look like a fool or anything, dude.  I'm really not.  But it's not a good look.  I got you, man.  That's a smart thing to do.  Absolutely.  I agree.  I think y'all getting it now, right?  What we're going out here?  Education?  Green is at least educated on the ID part.  Right, Green?  Can you acknowledge that?  No, no, I'm talking about on public property.  You don't have no authority, correct?  Well, we have jurisdiction, which is concurrent in North Carolina.  Oh, my God.  If I break the law, maybe, but I'm not breaking the law.  You know what I mean?  You're trying to play it off now like you know what you're talking about.  You really don't.  You already established that, Green.  Come on.  You're not making yourself look any better.  Acknowledge the fact that you was wrong, and I'll leave you alone.  You can't do it, can you?  He can't do it.  Yeah, guys, he can't.  He can't do it.  He can't.  He can't.  He can't own up to his mistake.  Congratulations.  Thank you for educating.  There you go.  See, there you go.  Now this man right here knows what he's talking about.  Hey, Green, have a good day, man.  Don't be trying to arrest nobody for bullshit anymore.  The Constitution lives.  The Constitution survives.  Give you one of them.  Have a good day.  I know I'm cold.  I know, right?  I'm all about it.  Thank you for being nice when you come up here and you wasn't like Green.  Because Green didn't even know what he was talking about.  You know.  That's fine.  You did a great job.  You was cordial.  You was nice.  You didn't try to arrest nobody for something stupid.  You know what I mean?  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you so much.  Laugh at him.  Yeah.  Laugh at Green.  Please.  Hey.  Please.  Laugh at Green.  Have a good chuckle about this.  It'll be alright.  You don't have to say nothing.  Say hey to YouTube.  Can you say something for me?  Can you say subscribe to NC Tyrant Hunter?  Subscribe to what is it?  NC Tyrant Hunter.  There you go.  Thank you.
