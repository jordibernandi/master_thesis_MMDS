            "text": "I have never in my entire career had more attempts to censor me than on this particular topic.  I am being called dangerous, told that I need to stay quiet, my channel has been flagged, my tweets get flagged.  I have never had more attempts at silencing than when I have shared actual numbers, actual information from scientists, from data that we're seeing collected about the virus.  I have been really, truly appalled at the level of censorship that has been attempted towards me on this topic.  Now listen, we're not all going to agree on a lot of various subjects, but information is power.  Knowledge is power.  And because you might think somebody is sharing a different point of view that you, for whatever reason in your mind, thinks that's going to get people killed or that is dangerous in some way, I mean, that that alone in and of itself is dangerous.  The attempts at censorship.  I saw today that the Federalist, they had published a paper about parties and, you know, and kind of really it wasn't even they were the article from the Federalist was talking about some of what we're going to be talking about today.  And their tweet was flagged.  Their their page was taken off of Twitter for a while and then it was restored again.  Just for sharing a different perspective from a doctor.  A doctor wrote the article, shared a different perspective.  People didn't like the perspective and it was censored.  We're seeing more and more censorship on YouTube.  I can't even say certain words or this video will get censored.  I'm just seeing so many more calls for censorship when it comes to this.  And it is just extremely alarming to me.  I see this coming from the left.  I am not seeing it coming from the right.  I am seeing from the left people talking about essentially a medical martial law.  They're wanting to take freedoms away from people.  And I understand they say, well, it's for your safety, but that's what they always say when it comes to locking people up.  And keeping people away from doing whatever it is that they want to do.  I'm seeing now here in Los Angeles, we're ticketed.  If we go outside, it's considered a misdemeanor in foreign countries.  That's happening as well.  These are things that I never thought I would see happen in my lifetime.  And they're happening now.  And there's always a reason for it, whether it be terrorist attacks or war or now it's some... You know, it's a natural virus that Mother Nature has decided to unleash on mankind, and we have to now stay safe, and so we've got to take all of our freedoms away.  You have to remain locked up or you're going to be fined.  You have to remain silenced or we're going to take your information down.  You're not allowed to speak.  What has this world come to?  It's extremely alarming to me, and... It is, I've always known that there was more censorship coming from the left these days.  It wasn't always this way.  And in some factions of the right, it is very much they're wanting to do the censoring.  They're wanting to do the control.  It's really, honestly, I always just say it's the same person.  It's the same type of person with the same type of brain.  They come from the left.  They come from the right.  They're exactly the same.  From the right, it's a moral fascism.  And on the left, it's also a moral fascism.  They just don't agree on their morals.  From the right, it's I want to control who you love and your medical decisions.  I'm going to control all of these things, the way you dress, the way you talk.  That also comes from the right.  And then from the left, it is also the way you talk, the words you use.  You can't use certain phrases.  You can't say certain things.  You can't believe in certain things.  You can't read certain material.  It is the same brain.  It is the same type of person.  It is just coming from two different types of morality.  But other than that, they are both moral fascists.  That is what these two groups are.  They share the same brain.  It's like they were just born in different parts of the country and they just had different upbringings.  But otherwise, it's identical.  And it is alarming to me.  It is alarming.  It is not the type of world that I want to live in if I'm just going to have all of this censorship and moral fascism thrown in my direction.  I don't like it coming from the right and I don't like it coming from the left.  So I just wanted to bring that up. ",
