            "text": "I don't care if you're Baptist, if you're Lutheran, if you're Methodist, if you're Pentecostal.  Everybody can agree that there's only one way to heaven and it's Jesus and it's through the cross and it's through the blood.  And that must be preached.  and we can agree on these things and we can amen these things and we can affirm these things.  But will we live them out?  And will we live the gospel and will we allow it to change the world that we live in?  Because if we really believe that there's power in it, we'll preach it and we'll release it.  There's a lot more power in the gospel than is being demonstrated by the church.  I think in many ways the church has become harmless.  We have made friends with the world.  And I'm not talking about the fact that we do worldly things, although that may also be part of it.  But the point is that we have come to a sort of a compromise.  We won't bother you if you don't bother us.  We'll stay on our side of the fence if you stay on your side of the fence.  We'll just do our Christian thing inside the walls of the church.  We'll keep it behind the stained glass windows if you won't tell us that we can't celebrate Christmas or something.  You know, it's this compromise.  But that was never the way the gospel was intended to be.  Jesus said, upon this rock I will build my church and the gates of hell will not prevail against it.  And that was not a defensive statement.  That was an offensive statement.  That meant that as we aggressively attack the gates of hell, they will not be able to stand in our way.  We were always meant to be the aggressors.  We were always meant to be the hunters.  We were always meant to be the overcomers.  Christianity is intended to be offensive in every sense of the word.  And as you go, Jesus says, preach, saying, the kingdom of heaven is at hand.  Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils.  Freely you have received, now freely give.  One of the most tragic things that has happened in the evolution of the church through the ages is that a system has evolved that that has separated two classes of people that we have decided exist.  We call them the clergy and the laity.  What that means is there is a group of people that are supposed to be the ones Up in front, speaking, teaching, preaching, doing the work of the ministry.  And then there's all the rest of you.  You are the spectators.  You are the ones who are supposed to be the good Christians and put your offering in the plate and amen when I say hot button cliches.  That's the way that most of the body of Christ works, whether we like it or not.  But that is not... anywhere in the bible.  in fact when the bible does speak about the five-fold gifts in ephesians the apostle prophet pastor teacher evangelist it says that their job is to equip the saints to do the work of the ministry.  and so if the five-fold if the pastors evangelists prophets apostles teachers if we were compared to a football team in the body of christ we would be the water boys.  And our job is just to keep you, the real players on the field, refreshed and equipped and out there winning the game.  But the devil has come up with a great plan.  He's convinced us that the 99.9% of the body of Christ that Jesus intended would be this overcoming church should just sit quietly in their pews and behave while the 0.1% called the preachers do all the work.  No wonder we have such an uphill battle to climb.  And as I began to see this over the last probably three or four years, I have begun to woke up that what God is trying to do is raise up the body, not just the clergy, to do the work of the ministry and to preach the gospel.  Jesus said, as you go.  That's right, you, even if you're not a professional preacher, even if you don't have a television show, even if you don't have a ministry, even if you don't get paid to do it, you are a servant of God.  And the power of the gospel is inside of you.  If we could learn to put our confidence in the power of the gospel, to trust it.  It really works.  You think you understand, but most of you, this has gone right over your head because you still think this is about you.  It's about how well you share the gospel, how good of an argument you can formulate, how many hours you've prayed that day, how holy your life is, how many spiritual credentials you have, how much you know about the Bible.  I hate to burst your bubble, but it's not those things.  And I don't say this, again, theoretically, I've seen this in my own life and in the lives of so many others.  The gospel just works.  It just works.  It's like if you have a gun in your hand.  I could take that gun and give it to my five-year-old.  And you wouldn't want him pointing it at you either.  It could be in my hand, it could be in his hand, but when that trigger is pulled, there is an explosion of power that is absolutely lethal.  And with the gospel in the hands of a brand new Christian or in the hands of an old saint, it carries the power to change people's lives.  If you could just learn to put your trust in it.  It would make you fearless.  What happens is, you know, we see somebody and we feel the prompting of the Holy Spirit to reach out to them and we immediately begin to think of the things that disqualify us, the reasons we can't do that.  Well, you know, I'd like to, but I missed my prayer time this morning.  I'd like to, but you know, I just didn't read my Bible yet today.  I'd like to, but I had that thought and it made me unclean and now I can't do this.  It's not you.  And if you will test what I'm saying, you'll discover it to be true.  It's not about me.  I know that always, but sometimes, you know, one of the dangers of being, having a great prayer life is you can think that your prayer life does it.  One of the dangers of fasting a lot is.  you might think that your fasting is what's creating the power.  One of the dangers about being very knowledgeable in the scriptures is that you might think that because of your vast learning that you have some advantage.  When really Jesus says, you come to me like a child.  That's how it works.  It's all you.  It's just you.  It's just you.  The power of the gospel, the power of the name of Jesus.  We have to learn to put our trust in it.  As you go, Jesus said, preach.  What are you going to preach?  The kingdom of heaven is at hand.  You know, if you study the life of Jesus and you study the teaching of Jesus, what he actually taught about, there's one thing that always rises to the surface.  You know what it is?  The kingdom.  In fact, even after Jesus rose from the dead, he was there with his disciples for another few weeks.  And it says that he kept teaching them about the kingdom.  That was his theme always, the kingdom of heaven is at hand.  And yet it's the one thing that we know very little about in the church.  One thing you almost never hear anybody speaking about or preaching about or even understanding.  The kingdom of God is the dominion of the king.  Jesus said, your kingdom come, your will be done.  Those are two inseparable realities.  When the kingdom is come, God's will is being done.  And when God's will is being done, the kingdom is there.  Those two things go hand in hand.  And we are supposed to be annexations of the kingdom of God.  You see, the will of God being done in you makes you a walking, roaming territory of the kingdom.  And wherever you go, the kingdom goes with you.  And Satan bows his knee, and sickness and depression leaves because the kingdom is there.  And I want you to get this in your spirit this afternoon.  This is not just some high, lofty, ethereal theological concept.  This is as concrete and solid as the platform I'm standing on.  Let me tell you something, when the kingdom has arrived, You will see it.  You will hear it.  You will feel it.  It will affect the natural world.  It will affect the natural reality.  Things begin to change when the kingdom arrives.  And this is why, after Jesus taught about the kingdom, he never left it there, he began to heal the sick, he began to raise the dead, he began to demonstrate that which he spoke of.  That's always the way it was.  He said, I've told you about the kingdom, now let me show you.  The kingdom requires demonstration.  Now, some people think that the reason that Jesus performed his miracles is because he was trying to prove his messiahship.  his claim to be the messiah.  but that's not true.  that's not why he did it.  he wasn't trying to prove that to anybody.  and if that was his job he did a poor job.  because remember the pharisees came to him and they said they saw him healing the sick cleansing the lepers and they said to him give us a sign that you are who you say you are.  remember that.  What were they looking for?  A blind eye opening.  That didn't prove to them that Jesus was the Messiah.  They wanted something like the parting of the Red Sea that Moses did or calling down fire from heaven like Elijah did.  Something like that.  That was what they were looking for.  Jesus didn't even entertain their request because he wasn't there to prove that he was the Messiah.  That wasn't the purpose.  He was there to show us what it looks like.  When a human being under the power of the Holy Spirit is carrying with them the dominion of the kingdom in a fallen world.  This is what Jesus was saying.  This is what it looks like.  I have come and put on flesh.  I walk as one of you as a man in the fallen world.  And I am demonstrating this.  Now you go and do the same thing.  Let me say it this way.  Jesus didn't heal the sick to prove that he could.  He healed the sick to prove that you could.  He didn't perform miracles to show what he could do.  He performed miracles to show what you can do.  He was our example.  Trust me, he could have called fire down from heaven.  But he wanted to show you what it looks like when the kingdom comes into the fallen world.  And that's why the very next verse reiterates this.  Heal the sick.  Cleanse the lepers.  Raise the dead.  Cast out devils.  freely you have received freely give.  in other words jesus said preach the kingdom tell them the kingdom of god is at hand and then show them.  heal the sick cleanse the lepers raise the dead cast out devils.  now i want to ask you a question.  why did he choose those four things?  There's lots of different miracles that he could have chose.  Why did he specifically choose to mention these four?  Heal the sick, raise the dead, cast out devils, cleanse the lepers.  Why those four?  I'll tell you why.  I believe that those four are four different categories of the miraculous.  They represent four different categories.  of kingdom dominion in the earth.  These are things that we should expect to see in our lives, always.  These are things we should be looking for.  That we should all be walking in.  All the time.  Let me ask you something.  What is your first reaction when you meet somebody on the street who's sick?  Is your first reaction to turn away?  Pretend like you don't see it?  What about somebody in your family?  Is your first reaction to reach for the medicine bottle?  To call the doctor?  Or is your first reaction to heal the sick?  You know, somebody asked me one time, specifically asking about street evangelism.  They said, well, you know, how do I get the words of knowledge to be able to pray for the people that are sick?  And I said, well, wait a minute.  I said, before you expect the Lord to start giving you supernatural words of knowledge, let me ask you a question.  What do you do when you see somebody with a cast on their foot?  If you're not reaching out to the things that are obvious, why should you expect God to show you the things that are hidden?  Increase comes as a result of stewardship.  Be faithful in little, Jesus says, and I will make you ruler over much.  You cannot expect to be given the much if you're not being faithful over the little.  You can't expect to receive the mysteries if you're not walking in the level of revelation that you already have.  Let me ask you, what can you do?  All of us can do something.  I guarantee that before the day is over today, if you wanted to, you could find some sick person to pray for and you could demonstrate the kingdom.  And you say, well, Daniel, what happens if they don't get healed?  Can I tell you, you know, when I started working with Evangelist Bonkey, I said to him the same thing.  I said, what happens if I'm in a meeting and I pray for somebody and they don't get healed?  He said to me, Daniel, if you pray for 99 and not one of them is healed, pray for number 100 as though all those before had been healed.  Because your experience does not change the word of God.  A good friend of mine who has one of the most profound street evangelism ministries that I know of told me he prayed for a thousand people before he saw one get healed.  But he kept going because he said, my experience doesn't change God's word.  Now he sees the sick healed everywhere.  My question to you is, what will you do with what's in your hand?  So healing the sick, we all understand that.  But then he says, cleanse the leper.  That could seem redundant, couldn't it?  I mean, lepers are sick people, right?  So why does he say, heal the sick, cleanse the leper?  I'll tell you why.  Because leprosy was more than a sickness.  You see... Lepers had a distinct situation where if you were a person with leprosy, you had to declare it and you were no longer allowed to come into the temple.  You are no longer allowed to perform religious ceremonies.  You are no longer allowed to live in town with other people.  You were ostracized.  You were rejected.  You were set apart.  You were given a scarlet letter and sent to live with these rejected people.  You are an outcast person.  You are an outsider.  And this is what religion does.  Judaism included.  Religion is a system of separating the haves from the have-nots.  From those we like, from those we don't like.  The clean from the unclean.  The good from the bad.  You go over there and you come inside.  You are welcome because of the color of your skin or the nationality that you were born into or the religion that you're a part of.  And you have to go on the outside because you're not one of us.  That's religion.  But when Jesus came, he flipped the whole thing upside down.  He said, now what I want you to do is not only do I want you to reject people and send them away, I want you to open your doors and bring the rejects in.  I want you to go to the outcasts.  I want you to go to the outsiders.  This is not about separating us from them.  This is about us going to them.  I pray that your church would be full of prostitutes.  and drug addicts.  I pray that it would be full of rejects.  I pray that it would be full of outcasts.  I pray that it would be full of troublemakers.  It almost seems to me like there is a chronological order here.  Heal the sick, cleanse the leper, raise the dead, cast out devils.  Like it's getting more, like the level of kingdom demonstration is going up with each consecutive category.  except this last one throws me, because how is casting out devils, how could that ever be considered greater than raising the dead?  Right?  When Jesus says cast out devils, it's a category, understand.  It is a whole category of kingdom demonstration.  He's not just talking about casting one devil out of one demoniac, although that's also part of it.  But there is something much bigger than that.  You see, the ultimate demonstration that the kingdom has arrived is when the power of the enemy is exercised.  When the wise men of Israel had turned their backs on Jesus, they knew where he was gonna be born, remember?  But they didn't care.  They told Herod where he was gonna be born, but they didn't go worship.  So what did God do?  He went and found some pagan astrologers from Persia and said, you go worship my son.  I tell you, the very rocks would praise him if we wouldn't.  Our calling, my friends, is not just to be good Christian people here in Orlando, paying our taxes and making sure that we don't kick something into our neighbor's yard that they don't like.  That's not what it's about.  We are supposed to take this thing over.  We are supposed to kick the devil out.  We are supposed to exercise his influence from every corner of society, from the world.  That is the call of the church.  Let the church arise in Jesus' name. ",
