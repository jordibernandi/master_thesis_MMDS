            "text": "All right.  So what's up?  Who are you filming for?  Are you making a movie?  I'd rather not say.  Okay.  All right.  It's kind of private.  It's kind of private?  Yeah.  Why are you filming?  No particular reason.  I'm just taking some pictures.  Pictures?  Oh, yeah.  Some photographs, video.  For what reason?  I'd rather not say.  Okay.  They're concerned that they don't know who you are and you're filming.  Okay.  So that's why we're here.  If you would remain at least on the road, it would prevent us from having a false service.  No, I can't.  We're not going to do what they say.  All right, well, don't violate my rights right now because I'm going to stand on the grass.  Just so you know, you're also being recorded.  That's good.  All right, guys, I'm out here at the water treatment plant here in Ybor City, Tampa, Florida.  I'm going to conduct this First Amendment audit.  I'm going to see if they respect my right to record in public.  I don't want to step on your property.  Yeah, you guys waving me over there.  You're not doing anything wrong.  You're in public space.  You're okay.  Okay.  I was just curious.  What's your name?  Vaginal.  Who are you?  I'm Steve from AmeriSafety.  AmeriSafety?  Oh, security?  Yeah.  All right.  So what's up?  Who are you filming for?  Are you making a movie?  I'd rather not say.  Okay.  It's kind of private.  It's kind of private?  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  What are you doing?  I was just curious what you were doing.  What's your job?  What do you do?  I'm a security.  I maintain the gate, access control, and stuff like that.  Yeah.  So, in any event, I hope you're having a great day.  Okay.  No problem.  Bye.  See you.  Very close back.  America.  America.  Make a nice day, man.  Trump 2020.  Do I look like I need help?  No, I'm just wondering why you're filming.  No particular reason, just taking some pictures.  Pictures?  Oh, yeah.  Some photographs, video.  For what reason?  I'd rather not say.  All right.  Is this private property?  Oh, it's private property.  Okay.  All right, cool.  Well, I'm standing on public property.  Okay.  I'm standing on public.  So there's no specific reason?  I'd rather not say, man.  It's a secret.  It's a secret, man.  All right.  Thank you.  All right, so we got this guy doing the walk of shame right here.  I can't hear you.  I can't hear you.  Excuse me?  I can't talk about it.  It's private.  It's private.  You ever heard of the First Amendment?  Yeah, I'm just doing a story on the First Amendment, and now you're in it, I guess.  I don't know what you want to do about that.  I mean, you can ask.  It doesn't mean I have to answer anything.  All right, so he's gonna go back over there.  I'm gonna stick with him.  See how this turns out, guys.  Oh, wow, guys.  Looks like they called the cops on me.  All right, guys, so let's see if this guy respects our rights.  I appreciate everybody being here today.  You know they called, right?  Who called?  The business.  Oh, what am I doing?  What business called?  I'm out here on the street videotaping a lot of business.  How you been doing?  You all right?  I'm all right.  How are you?  I'm good.  What's your name and badge number?  You know my name.  No, actually, no, I don't.  It's right there.  Carmack, we dealt with it all the time.  It doesn't matter.  342 is right there.  342?  What's your name?  Yep, right there.  A. Carmack?  That's it.  All right.  I'm the only one here, you know what I'm saying?  But on my camera, there's people watching, and they just want to know in case anything happens, you know?  In case you violate my rights.  Obviously, they're just concerned about somebody.  They don't know who you are.  We do, right?  Okay.  You know where you can stand and where you can't stand and whatnot, so you're good?  I mean, I guess.  Actually, I'm a little perplexed.  You know, I'm shocked.  You know, it's scary that they called the cops on me, called a bunch of armed people to come out here and deal with me.  You know, it's a shame.  It's like you have rights, they have rights, and we have to respond.  Oh, I understand that.  You understand that, right?  Yeah, it's just the world must be coming to an end when public photography... I don't know.  I'm out of words, man.  I'm just out of words.  Just out of words.  You doing all right?  Yeah, I'm out here just doing a little story about the plant, the sewage.  Gotcha.  Buckeye Terminal.  How's the wife?  She doing all right?  She's good, man.  Good.  All right, now.  All right.  Just don't go on their property.  It's not that.  I want you to go talk to them so they know about the First Amendment.  Oh, I'm going to let them know that you're okay, that you're not a threat to them, right?  Right.  That doesn't take away from the fact that you can't be on their property, which you're not.  You know the rules.  I'm going to let them know that you know the rules.  I'm standing over here, too, because the property line, see where the utilities come down?  And see that?  See this?  This is a city pole.  I make sure that I stand right here.  Do me a favor, right?  Wait, I want to say... Do me a favor.  If you would remain at least on the road, it would prevent us from having a call service.  No, I can't.  Okay, I can't.  And honestly, that video from the port, I don't know if you went back and looked at it, but guys, this is the officer that responded.  My live was real choppy.  I had to take it down.  You kind of pushed me off of the sidewalk and then told me, hey, you're allowed to be over there.  But you know what I'm saying?  That actually violated my rights right there.  I just violated your rights.  Oh, you didn't?  No.  All right.  Well, don't violate my rights right now because I'm going to stand on the grass.  Just so you know, you're also being recorded.  That's good.  I'm glad.  There'll be an unedited version, right?  The body camera, not what you put up.  Right.  This ain't going to be edited.  Where you're at, this is not going to be edited.  Okay.  All right.  So, listen.  You're not in violation.  I know I'm not.  We'll let them know that.  Right.  You know what you got to do and what you can't do.  I mean, there's absolutely no way I can go on the property.  It's gated.  You know what I'm saying?  Oh, I won't.  They were waving for me to answer some questions.  And I said, what are you trying to do, bait me?  You know what I'm saying?  They're like, wow.  So I'm just going to continue to take pictures out here.  I'm not done.  I'm out here protecting everybody's.  First Amendment right, guys.  And these guys called the cops on me.  This is sickening.  It's a sickness.  Everything that's going on today, guys, and we're worried about a camera, we're worried about a guy out here doing public photography, okay?  Everybody, pick up a camera and protect our rights.  Good?  Yeah, man.  Anything else for me?  I didn't need your... Oh, anyway.  They did.  What?  Hey, they called the cops, right?  Okay, so if I call the cops and make up a false crime, I'm going to get in trouble.  What's the crime they say I committed?  Nobody said you committed a crime.  They're concerned that they don't know who you are and you're filming.  Okay.  So that's why we're here.  We're here to determine that.  They don't determine crimes.  You know what I'm concerned about?  That you're the only one in Tampa that I see filming.  You're the only one in Tampa with a body cam, it seems like.  I mean, hey, I'm ashamed of my city for that.  At least you know I am, so, okay?  Okay, man.  What's the incident report number?  Oh, Google it?  No, that's not how it works, man.  It's right there.  You can get offline.  I can't give it to you from there.  Yeah, you can.  No, it's not a public records request.  It's an incident report number.  You're going to file it?  Okay, guys.  It's an incident report, first of all.  Okay.  Yep.  All right, guys, you see us get incident reports all the time.  You see this, guys?  This guy lies, says we can't get an incident report.  Wow, we can't get an incident report number from this guy.  That's a shame, guys.  That's a shame.  He said I can Google it.  What a liar.  Ashamed of it.  Ashamed.  I can't believe this.  You know, actually, I'm gonna.  I'm gonna.  I'm gonna approach this guy because this is not right.  Excuse me, sir.  Excuse me, sir.  So I need assistance.  I'm a citizen that needs assistance.  Yeah.  Hey, bud, you got an incident report number?  244-071.  Okay, another thing.  He always tries to push me off.  I'm perfectly fine standing on the grass.  I'm a member of the media.  You wouldn't come out here until Fox 13 is down the street.  This gentleman just told me to stand on the street, and I'm not going to.  I'm not going to die for nobody.  You know what I'm saying?  I'm not going to die for nobody.  I'll die for my cause, but I won't die for nobody else.  Now they're blocking the road.  So we got the incident report number at least.  So this guy tells me I got to stand on the street, do him a favor, stand on the street so they won't call?  I don't think so, buddy.  I'm going to stay here until these guys leave and kick rocks, man.  I don't have to go on that street.  So at least this guy's doing his job.  Now these guys are wasting our tax dollars, guys.  It's a shame.  See, look, these guys are parked there.  This guy can't get through.  Wow.  Sovereign citizens.  Look at this.  Get out of here.  Kick rocks.  The hell out of here.  I'll stand where I want to stand.  All right guys, I'm gonna go ahead and head out of here.  hit the subscribe button.  hit that like if you didn't already.  I'll catch you on the next video. ",
