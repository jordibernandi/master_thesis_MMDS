He probably should have got off one stop earlier, but... I think part of what we have to teach in our history, because we spend so much time teaching the nonviolent parts of Black history.  that's led many people into believing that throughout our entire heritage, all we did was, you know, sit and pray and sing songs and stuff.  No, you had the Stonewall Rebellion.  You had John Brown.  You had the original Cassius Clay.  Look up a lot of our history and find out exactly what happened and the battles that took place.

As our community comes together to support the fight against racial injustice, I want to take a second to talk about one thing we can do to ensure our voices are heard.  Not tomorrow, but now.  Have your voices heard in terms of what kind of future we want by taking the 2020 census today at 2020census.gov?  Now, folks, let me help you out.  The census is a count of everyone living in the country.  It happens once every 10 years.  It is mandated by the US Constitution.  The thing that's important is that the census informs funding, billions of dollars, how they are spent in our communities every single year.  I grew up in Clinton Park in Houston, Texas, and we wanted new parks and roads and senior citizens in there.  Well, the census helps inform all of that and where funding goes.  It also determines how many seats your state will get in the U.S.  House of Representatives.  Young black men and young children of color are historically undercounted, which means a potential loss of funding services.  that helps our community.  Folks, we have the power to change that.  We have the power to help determine where hundreds of billions in federal funding go each year for the next 10 years, funding that can impact our community, our neighborhoods, and our families and friends.  Folks, responses are 100% confidential and can't be shared with your landlord, law enforcement, or any government agency.  So please, take the 2020 Census today.  Shape your future.  Start at 2020census.gov. ",
