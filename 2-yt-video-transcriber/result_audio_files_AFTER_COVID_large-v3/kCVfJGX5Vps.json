            "text": "Welcome to the Thought News Network, where we expose thoughts, one headline at a time.  Black Ram 313 back again with some news for the network.  I have an interesting article today to read.  The title of this article is Apocalypsing the dating trend that could happen to anyone.  written by Molly Longman.  I'm going to read the article and give the breakdown at the end of it.  Here we go.  And to quote Molly Longman, Over the last 11 months, a few of my more conservative friends have confessed to me that they think we're in the end times.  I don't buy it, but I have noticed this mentally creeping into my dating life amid the sea pandemic.  I feel an unexpected new pressure to lock down the one like ASAP.  Because of that, I've ignored red flags, made up excuses when someone consistently forgets to text me back and chalked up any weird communication issues to see related stress.  I want any budding relationship to last forever, even if it's hanging on by a string because who knows what the future holds.  And just think of all the work it takes to meet someone new and slowly add them to your life, especially during the pandemic.  Turns out this pattern is surprisingly common amid the pandemic.  Case in point, a new trend called apocalypsing is on the rise.  According to the dating service Plenty of Fish, which polled more than 2000 singles, apocalypsing, according to POF, consists of treating every relationship like it's your last.  You meet someone you're infatuated with.  And then, bada bing, bada boom, suddenly you're super serious, firmly established in each other's C-19 bubbles and ready to plan your life together.  One third of singles POF polled said they know someone who's done this.  Generation Z is particularly prone to it, with nearly a third admitting to the trend.  It's an easy trap to fall into.  One minute you're meeting for socially distanced drinks and the next you're imagining all the cute activities you can do in quarantine together.  The jigsaw puzzles, the sourdough starters from there.  And from there, the question is, would they be a good parent?  What will the name of your kids be?  Some call it daydreaming.  Others have dubbed it emotionally projecting.  However you refer to it, we have more time for it thanks to our new 2020 and 2021 schedules.  And it can lead to some catching feelings sooner than might be healthy.  But even though we have trendy new names for it, getting attached to a partner prematurely was common even before the C, says Danielle Forshee, a psychologist and marriage therapist.  Only now the propensity to quickly latch onto a potential partner is over there.  Your last chance for happiness can even be stronger thanks to the lack of human contact we're now experiencing.  This can cause us to feel an infinity for someone more quickly than we typically would, or even to settle for someone we might have otherwise written off.  It can also make us rush to the semi-serious act of letting someone into our C-19 bubble just for the company.  Although it's certainly a good thing to be open and treat every date as though it has a potential for long-term happiness, it's also a good idea to have a discerning eye and get to know someone before you start picking out curtains for your future children's nursery.  But that's easier said than done, especially now.  If you trend toward apocalypsing, 4She has a few suggestions.  One way to avoid it is to make sure that you are bolstering your support system.  The more socially isolated we are, the more likely we are to get attached to somebody.  If we're feeling lonely, we want emotional connections, we should then lean on our social supports rather than someone who's new or just for now.  Now is the time to lean on friends and family if you need emotional support from someone.  End quote from the article.  There's more to read, but it's all fluff and I won't bore you with such details.  So again, end quote from the article called Apocalypsing the Dating Trends.  that could happen to anyone by Molly Longman.  And since most of it is fluff, let me take time to read between the lines.  Apocalypsing a dating trend question.  is she now getting desperate?  answer of course but hold on hold on hold on shorty hold on hold on suck you by.  hold on rotten tequila banana.  hold on ray beat snow bunny and may ling.  wait wait wait.  what happened to your strength and independence?  stay strong and independent.  We're going to need you to be tough.  We're going to need you to stay strong like you say that you really, really are.  You know the old saying, when the going gets tough, the tough get going.  It's in the hard times where you proclaim your strength, not when it's comfortable and convenient.  Unless now, oh, if you fail, unless the idea of strength is just a fiction that the creature instinctively knows is just a facade.  And in the face of real calamity, the creature looks for strength in men instead of itself, which we know to be true.  Scared now, huh?  So now she's trying to get wifed up because many believe that we're in the end times.  Pandemics.  War, empty store shelves, civil unrest, economic collapse, all out chaos.  What will the creature do?  That's the question.  And we know that.  the answer that she will always look for a guy like you.  That's the answer.  She wants you to put on your cape because she needs saving.  up, up and away like Superman.  Take her out of this calamity.  Save her from what's coming.  The impending doom that we all know that's near.  Scared now, huh?  And in that day, seven fee fails shall take hold of one man saying we will eat our own bread and wear our own apparel.  Only let us be called by thy name to take away thy approach.  Isaiah 4 and 1.  Is this the day?  Are we approaching this day in our lifetime?  And just as importantly, what will you do, gentlemen?  Are you going to save her?  For me, it will be catch and release even in the apocalypse because I don't want her, no matter how humble she comes to me, no matter how much the creature begs, I don't want you.  Why?  Because then she will be just another liability, another mouth to feed.  And when food is scarce enough, and your stomach is rumbling, the veg loses its value indeed.  I'm not gonna consume less calories, eat less food because of the rot box.  No thank you.  She can keep her rot box and fend for herself.  I don't plan to help.  What will you do?  And sure, she's going to come humbly and talk about how good she is and what she can offer.  A lot of guys will accept it, but it will be to your detriment, even demise to do so.  She didn't want me when the lights was on, when the store shelves was full.  Don't want me when the lights go out and there's nothing left in the store but dust.  And understand this.  The creature in times like this doesn't want you.  She needs you because it's desperate.  See, I'm not the guy that she can fool.  Again, she didn't want a dude that was intelligent and insightful.  She didn't want a man with a plan.  She didn't want a man who was truly a leader in the good times.  But she's desperate now.  So no, baby.  No, no, no, no, no.  Do not seek me out of your desperation.  Don't look for Thuggo to save you.  Go find that man that you said you required.  that was six foot forever, built and tough and all this other stuff.  Go look for the guy who you admire like Idris Elba.  Go call Batman.  Don't look my way.  I will not take you in your desperation.  I won't fall for it, but many guys will.  Because being desperate, her being desperate is the opportunity that many guys are looking for so they can slither up because their self-worth and esteem and value is very low.  But again, this will be to their detriment.  They'll believe the lies and the game that she spits and is there believing that these females actually want them naturally and organically when indeed she just wants you out of desperation.  And she will show herself to be a grand liability or even a setup.  So you have to be careful.  But those who are wise will shine and sit back and observe Babylon tumble.  And those who are wise will not be the one putting on their capes to save her.  But until that time and during that time, the best of us who understand the times and what must be done will keep it casual and occasional with her.  We'll pump and let her dump the catch and release method by BlackRam313 because we don't date or recreate.  Neither do we save desperate H to the O's.  Like the video.  Subscribe to the channel.
