            "text": "It's Monday morning, I'm here in Dover, and that's because I'm not going to let this story drop.  Lots of press reports over the weekend suggesting I was quite wrong to have gone to East Sussex last week.  This is a scandal, it's continuing.  So I'm here, it's early morning in Dover, relatively flat seas, as you can probably see, and just down there, Gavin, are now an ambulance, some Border Force cars... at about 20 people.  And that means that somewhere out there in the Channel, what's happening is that our border forces, who are meant to protect our borders, have picked up some legal migrants who will now be ferried into Dover.  So for us now, it's just a waiting game.  You can see here, there's a border force vessel with a grey boat.  that has picked up a dinghy at sea and you can now see coming off it there's a boat tram full of people and these are all migrants illegal immigrants coming into Dover today.  There are about 20 people there waiting for them.  I don't know all of this costs.  It must be an absolute fortune.  I've no idea what the health status in terms of the virus is of any of these people coming in.  The border force is supposed to protect our borders, not be a taxi service for illegal immigrants.  And yet that's what the Home Office are telling them to do.  I've seen the second vessel coming in.  It looks like 16, 18 people this morning have been brought in here, including a young baby.  They're the ones that have been captured.  They're the ones that will now get processed.  They're the ones that will now be allowed to stay in the country.  They're the ones that will disappear.  Some of them who've got money may be okay.  They might have relations.  Others will effectively finish up.  I'm sure working in conditions quite close to slavery.  These are the ones today that were caught.  I wonder, given how calm it was this morning, how many on other parts of this south coast arrived today and spirited off, never to be seen again.  What is going on here is a scandal.  It needs to be dealt with.  They're docked, they're on British soil.  There are about ten people on that vessel, including a very young baby, so there's enormous risks that people are taking.  But remember, all of this organised by criminals, trafficking gangs.  Remember that even if some of these people qualify as refugees, you claim refugee status in the first safe country you come to.  France is a safe country and I do just get the feeling that we're being so weak about this that if already over a thousand people come this year Goodness knows what this figure is going to be.  If we get a calm summer, they'll start covering much, much bigger vessels.  And we've got to get a grip on this.  I think the public care hugely about it.  I've been here today, witnessed it for myself.  It can't be allowed to continue. ",
