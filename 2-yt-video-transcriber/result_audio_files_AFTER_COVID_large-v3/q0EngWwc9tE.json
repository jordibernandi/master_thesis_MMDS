            "text": "This is an open letter to Pastor Greg Locke of Global Vision Bible Church in Juliet, Tennessee.  Now, I normally don't give extra attention to attention seekers, but I think there may be some utility in drawing attention to your example.  Don't get excited.  It's not a compliment.  I saw your protest video on Twitter, you know, the one where you're out there at the demonstration, joining at the human Petri dish in violation of state instructions for shelter in place.  The hard right has long been predictably batshit about this kind of stuff.  You know, other citizens of America and the world, they get it.  They get the concept of abiding by a social contract that helps protect their fellow human beings during a global pandemic.  And your first instinct is, of course, to knee-jerk into oblivion, grab a flag, crank up some Lee Greenwood, and join the right wingnuts who are boasting that they're prepared to die for their American right to die.  By the way, I just love the camera pan of the crowd.  You know, the shot where you stick your own face in the frame the whole time.  And I think this actually reveals what your little protest video was really about.  I mean, you can bloviate about freedom and liberty and God and Greenwood all you want.  The rest of us are onto you.  We are well aware you are engaging in an act of self-gratification.  You are theologically and patriotically masturbating.  and you should never masturbate in public.  Normally, the rest of us would see your little antics and we do what we always do.  We kind of shrug and move on, right?  You are what you are.  It's kind of sad, but fine.  For years, you've been a walking, talking self-refutation anyway.  You sell acceptance and Jesus while rejecting whole swaths of your fellow human beings, atheists, non-Christians, LGBT people.  Oh, you love to sound the warnings about gay people.  As if non-heterosexuality isn't perfectly natural and observable in hundreds upon hundreds of species throughout the animal kingdom, certainly no threat to you or your personal belief system.  Greg, man, gay marriage is a threat to your marriage?  Then either you or your spouse is gay.  Anyway, normally I just let it go.  We would just let it go.  We'd let you join all the others out there, you know, these truck honking duck dynasty viewers, you know, when they're not out there opening beer cans with their teeth.  You can boot scoot their hometowns and hold up their misspelled protest signs all they want.  The problem is, all of this public and literal mouth-breathing, it's making the country a more dangerous place.  You remind me a little bit of Evangelist Kenneth Copeland, the guy who talks to the virus, a contagion spread through the discharge of the mouth and nose.  And he thinks he can kill it by spitting.  I mean, you're out there spitting, pretty much.  COVID-19!  COVID-19!  I blow the wind of God on you.  I used to be empathetic to this stuff.  I used to be a Christian.  And I get it.  Many believers are good people.  And if you want to believe personally, fine.  You want to believe in a book that says that you're the descendant of a dirt man and a rib woman in a garden?  A book that's got talking animals and blood magic and penguins boarding an ark in the desert and a woman impregnated by a ghost so a super baby can grow up and save everybody from his own perfect plan?  You want to believe that stuff?  Knock yourself out.  If you want to sit around your own little pod and breathe on everybody, fine.  But when you throw yourself out into the public, you then become a problem for the rest of us.  You're a potential infection point for everybody you meet.  And if you guys were a closed system, we'd just let you sit around and knock each other out of the gene pool.  But COVID-19 is highly contagious.  We got people who have to get out into public, into the mix, into your potential zone.  Certainly our healthcare workers People who are going to be forced to deal with these neuron-free corona victims who picked up the virus inside one of your little MAGA circle jerks.  That means you're taking up valuable time and resources that we need for other things.  You're also an infection point for people who just need to get out and buy groceries and get basic necessities.  Not just them.  You're endangering their spouses, their kids, anybody in their house, anybody they might bump into along the way.  I don't know if there's language to express how myopic and selfish you are being.  Nobody's saying we're not hugely grieved about the economic consequences of this lockdown.  But most Americans still get it.  Statistically, they support social distancing and the shutdown of major potential infection points because... We are not prepared for this novel virus because people are dying, because we care about human life.  Hell, many of the people who've recovered are permanently damaged.  We've had amputees, lung damage, heart damage, and much more stuff we may not know about yet.  Your liberties are not under attack.  You're not under personal attack.  You still get to be an American.  It ain't about you.  For once, Pastor Locke, it ain't about you.  So get over yourself, all of you.  You and the rest of these flag-waving, gun-toting, so-called freedom fighters getting off on themselves.  You are not helping.  You're actually hurting the country that you profess to love.  You're potentially hurting or killing your fellow human beings.  Go bang your Bible inside your own house or in your little country church.  You can make your videos telling the rest of us how wrong we are and how correct you are in the Bible.  You can build... You're bigotry in a free speech culture that protects that stuff.  It still allows you to have your tragic opinions.  And while you're doing that, stay the hell away from the rest of us.  You are a public safety hazard, all of you.  And while the rest of the world is playing by the rules and empathizing and understanding and doing what's necessary until this is all over so that it can be over, you are nothing more than a cautionary tale, an example of the worst thing to do.  And the truth is, if the best incarnation of Jesus... was alive and here and watching all of this, that Jesus would tell you to get your ass home and shut your mouth for the sake of the rest of us, for the sake of the rest of his fragile, precious children.
