            "text": "Through the seven sacraments of the church, Jesus is present, ministering to his people, healing, nourishing, and anointing them.  These seven holy sacraments are not just symbols of Christ.  They are encounters with him.  Glimmering from the lamps of countless sanctuaries throughout two millennia, God's presence in Christ illumines our souls in unbroken light.  The sacraments are the most important things in the world.  What was visible in our Savior has now passed into the sacraments.  The fundamental sacrament is the Church itself.  The seven sacraments now are the means by which the Church expresses its life.  The Word became flesh, but now that incarnation is prolonged across all of space and time through the seven sacraments.  Thank you. ",
