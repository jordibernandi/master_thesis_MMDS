You know, only the desperate and most needy are the people.  that will be willing to get in line straight away, would be my suspicion.  Here are some stats on the vaccine from CNN.  It's 95% effective in preventing infections, caused no serious safety concerns.  I think I heard yesterday that the pharmaceutical companies demanded indemnity from future lawsuits if there were any consequences.  COVID has killed almost 1.5 million people worldwide.  A mate of mine's in Los Angeles and he's saying, you know, still like thousands of people are dying every day.  He's saying if that was happening as a result of an earthquake, you'd think this is a national emergency.  This sort of fatalistic acceptance of a kind of glum new world.  So it's not straightforward.  I'm certainly by no means saying don't take a vaccine.  Neither am I saying Like, do take a vaccine.  Do you remember that there was that story about enlisting sensible celebrities to promote taking their vaccine?  I thought, well, when am I going to get the call?  When's old Russ, as a sensible celeb, going to get the phone call to show me banging myself up?  You can do it yourself.  You can do it at home.  And that's why I didn't get that phone call. ",

We've already heard that you won't be able to go to gigs, you won't be able to do this, that, you know.  Do you want more government authority or are you cynical about it?  That's one of the questions that I would put to you.  Do you feel a great deal of faith and trust in governments or do you feel uncertain about granting governments more authority and power?  Do you feel comforted by the idea that other people will be forced to take a vaccine or does it make you feel uncertain?  Now, here's a word of wisdom.  Any of you that want to have unshakable faith in the emergence of these vaccines, do not Google Pfizer controversy, or Pfizer bribery, or Pfizer scandal, or your faith may be shaken.  And I suppose that's one of the things we accept, that these kind of megalithic industries such as the pharmaceutical industry do operate in a rarefied space.  if that indemnity thing proves to be true that's an interesting aspect.  and certainly it's true that with pharmaceutical companies you kind of accept oh yeah no they had to lobby to get that through or they had to bribe someone because of that that particular thing happened with that particular drug and we accept that that's just the way the world is run that there is a layer of commerce that is added to political decisions and is necessary for political efficacy.  so perhaps this cynicism and mistrust that is in a sense endemic at the moment is because of the justifiable suspicions people have about the relationships between government and big business which have been proven again and again to be dubious.  and in a sense the government should have no agenda other than aiding, assisting, taking care of the people that they are elected to serve.  whenever you sense that there is an additional ingredient, particularly one that opposes that basic premise.  necessary to become suspicious.

But then Jen said, well, you don't have to inject a passport into your body.  I don't have to, but I sometimes do.  I mean, yes, that's interesting, isn't it?  Is this a condition of the new world?  I suppose, as I say, I have no view on whether or not you should take a vaccine or not take a vaccine.  But certainly we're in a new environment where new ideas are being leveraged on the basis of public health and safety.  that certainly seem to have another component due to some of the partners that are involved, notably Pfizer.  And at a time where people are concerned, as well as about their health, about individual liberty and the impediment on individual liberty imposed by government organisations aided and abetted by corporations, it seems it's concerning.  I hope that a viable vaccine emerges.  I hope not for a return to normal, to be absolutely honest, because of course, you know, I live in relative comfort.  I hope for a return to something far better.  I hope for a move towards a fairer, more just world where power and the decisions that affect people are moved much closer to the people affected by them, where there is much less cynicism and suspicion and much less cause for cynicism.
