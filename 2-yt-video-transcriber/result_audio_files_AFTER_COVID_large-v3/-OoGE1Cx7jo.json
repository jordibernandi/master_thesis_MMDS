            "text": "Maybe it's because... Let's recap.  On December 1st, 2018, the press announced that 41 had passed.  December 3rd is the day that the casket arrives and Washington basically shuts down for like a week and they do the... Flags at half-mast, they do the Lysen State in the Rotunda building, and rituals are performed like the wreath-laying ceremony, and then the public comes for two days to walk in circles around the casket and stare at it.  After the casket sits for these rituals on December 3rd and December 4th, December 5th is the day of the cathedral funeral ceremony, which we haven't gotten to yet.  To understand December 5th, you have to understand December 3rd and December 4th.  On December 3rd, 2018, the Bush family arrived to the U.S.  Capitol.  George Bush appears to be convinced that the General is one of the Insider DC Secret Club members.  The General made him think this when he said this.  If you want a ride, just come.  Get in.  Mr.  President, I was told to ask you about the member you were with yesterday.  Well, thank you.  A statement suggesting that he is a trusted insider.  I showed you how the General earned further trust when he did this.  and when he did this.  when we go inside we see kevin and nancy admit that they're filming movies and that the whole thing's like a show and apparently this is a ritual and that they're all surrounded by.  you're surrounded by the church of satan and There seems to be a question of who's in the box.  What it sounds like is somebody else except over there has passed away.  Oh, okay.  Yes, ma'am.  Oh, we can't forget this little gem of a joke.  Stank face.  Between the Supreme Court justices.  Let's add to his legacy this.  President Bush's religion.  It was a phallic religion.  He continued to pray for individuals.  Haha.  If you've missed any of what I just recapped, please go back and catch up.  So right now, we're still on December 3rd.  Up to this point, we've broken down all of the conversations on the stairs between the Bush family and the Bush family in general.  And we looked at the former cabinet members that are standing over on the other side.  We've looked at the grandkids and the kids, all of their conversations.  And even a bit of foreshadowing.  We're in a ritual.  Good to see you.  You don't say that.  I can't believe this.  Let's do it for evil.  At this point, the ceremony part outside is done and everybody's going to start going in.  The cabinet has streamed inside and then the Bush family is going to line up to come in after.  Our commander in chief is not attending this wreath laying ceremony, but Mike Pence is attending.  And he's arriving on the side of the building.  Look at his wife.  It's safe to say now that the General has successfully warmed up to not only GW and Laura Bush, but also Doro, her husband Mr.  Coke, and now Jeb and his wife.  While Neil is left with the impression that everyone is cool with the General... While these guys are waiting to go in to the terribly sad ritual, let's go have a look inside.  If the president asks for us, you better knock on the door.  In this next part, you'll see the total incompetence of the ushers that are supposed to be seating the generals and the cabinet members.  That director I just showed you lets all of them walk in the wrong way, doesn't say anything.  And then one of his little goons tries to redirect every single general through rows of seats to go sit in a completely different aisle.  Of course.  The military had like three days to pull together perfect formations for a state funeral.  This is purely bullshit.  We're going to find out why that crypt keeper is so distracted from doing his job.  While this entire section of guests are trying to come in to sit down, this usher stands there watching while everyone just stays confused.  There are even short chairs for the general.  So you see this guy call over for another chair while people are like stupefied.  Everyone's looking at the funeral director like he has five heads.  In a sec, I'm going to show you how nice she is.  Just ignore these guys.  This is the funeral director that can't figure out how to seat people.  This guy tries to help her with her coat and watch what she does.  Moron.  This guy, in a little bit, we'll get back to him.  It's going to be a minute before everybody sits down.  The bushes are populating in the back hall waiting also, so let's go look at another part of the room.  You better believe this funeral director still is bothering the guests.  Seating people is hard.  Here comes Pence, Ryan, and McConnell and their wives.  These guys and a couple unholy speakers will be speaking today.  And then we have a bunch of other politicians that are already there waiting before the Bush family comes in.  Now remember that a lot of these people do know that this is a ritual.  And if you watch their mouths, Some of them actually do the chant.  They'll look one way and then when they're moving their head back, they'll like slip it out like this lady.  Sometimes they do like chewing air gum before they actually say it.  And when they're doing it, they act like they're like distracted somewhere else.  So they do it and then they'll move their head around like there's something else going on.  It's so weird.  Let's watch again.  After Wilbur Ross acknowledges Mitch McConnell's wife, I really hope he doesn't say the chant just before Ryan's wife does it.  Book.  This guy looks almost as happy as the Bush family.  We've seen this guy and this lady behind him and then the lady that got the chair.  We've seen all of them at the SOTU.  So they work all these same events.  I don't know how long he's been in the swamp, but he cannot figure out seeding.  And he probably ticked off all those generals and made a fool of himself.  It's interesting that they work all the same events.  They're hell-bent on turning all of us just to get him.  That camera is filming us.  March forward.  He's faking it.  What it sounds like is somebody else except over there has passed away.  Oh, okay.  Yes, ma'am.  He's not even in it.  These people are so stupid.  I said to someone, who's in the box?  George Bush Sr.  is gone missing.  Here we see the Bushes filing in behind the box.  While the cabinet has their hand over their heart and they're facing the center where the coffin is going to be placed.  Look at the avoidance body language of Dick Cheney.  He is completely turned away.  He side shift eyes over to where the casket and the military is carrying it.  But he like turns his entire body in his face, almost hiding behind Dan Quayle.  My dog sometimes does that look when I catch him with garbage wrappers.  Bullock. ",
