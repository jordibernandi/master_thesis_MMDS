And this, so I see things and then I have knowings.  And I see and then I hear.  So I saw a laboratory in Wuhan, China, and that there was being bioengineered a man-made virus to release in the earth.  My knower went, man will say it came from a wet market, and the Lord said it did not.  Not in its origins.  It originated in Wuhan in a biological lab, man-made to be released, not from a wet market.  I'm not saying it didn't get released.  Someone picked it up, and then they go there.  That part, the Lord didn't show me, okay?  I want to be honest.  That part, I don't know.  But what I do know is what I saw.  I saw that there was being... weapon.  you heard what I just said a weapon being biologically engineered and a laboratory in Wuhan to be released upon the world. ",

Because I know the price that there can be and the cost that there can be on... going on the edge.  So, but about two and a half weeks ago in a very vivid dream, I had a book come and appear before me.  It had a dragon on the outside of it.  And it, it was the title of it was the global dragon warfare.  Now it was a manual.  It flipped open and I could read the table of contents.  And there were 12 chapters in the book, but it was the Global Dragon Warfare Manual.  I opened it up in the dream.  I go to the table of contents and there were 12, we could call them stages or phases, but in the manual, they were chapters.  In yellow highlight marker, it highlighted stage seven.  and my knower, see, this is like a combination of seeing, hearing, feeling, knowing.  So I saw dream, dragon, Reddit, global, Dragon Warfare Manual.  Flips open, table of contents.  I see 12.  So I saw that there would be 12 stages or phases highlighted in yellow on the seventh stage.

When you say Global Warfare Dragon, Global Warfare Dragon Manual, when you talk about the book, That is just as in the Bible and chapter, I believe it's 12 of Daniel.  It talks about a book of life.  There are many books in heaven and the devil has no origination.  So he's a counterfeit artist of what goes on in heaven.  So it makes sense if there are books in heaven, then the devil has books for his people. ",

            "text": "And Paul the Apostle said in the New Testament, we are not to be ignorant of the devil's schemes.  if we are not to be ignorant, that means that we have access, or we can have access, to what is God's plans, but we also, according to the will of the Lord and the leading of the Holy Spirit, not by pushing yourself out somewhere into a fake, false, prophetic, occult realm of astral projection.  No, no, no, no, no.  I don't push myself anywhere.  I worship God, I pray, I ask questions, and the Lord brings me into this.  So Paul said we're not to be ignorant of the devil's schemes.  So we can see into, hear into, peer into this schemata, the blueprints of the enemy at times.  So that's what this is.  And so I saw a manual of spiritual warfare is what you could call it.  of a global nature, the global dragon warfare.  I opened it up, highlighted on the seventh chapter or seventh phase, it said global pandemic.  And it was highlighted because that is where we are.  But stage six was the scourge of fear.  That is what was being released to lead up to the seventh stage, which is the global pandemic.  I saw into the eighth, and it was global economic collapse.  Now, what do you do with these things?  So, yes, that's just happened two and a half weeks ago.  I have submitted this to... prophets, intercessors, spiritual warfare experts, and we have multiple confirmations about the war with the red dragon. ",
