The officer that said he was the reporting officer now says he's not the reporting officer.  And everybody just went, well, if they're doing free speech, okay.  We got about 25 people there.  don't like what we're doing, and another 25 that love what we're doing.  In fact, two of them got into it with each other, and they got separated by the police.  And so anyway, while all this was going on, one person who was engaged in their free speech, a defense attorney didn't like it, and confronted him, which is fine.  And he'd sit there and talk all day.  Yeah.  They'd buzz each other out.  I could care less.  But the defense attorney started poking him in his chest so hard that he pushed him back.  He probably weighs 120 pounds.  Is he all right?  I felt that he was going to get assaulted.  So I got in between him.  And I did this.  And I said, stop touching me.  I can't touch you.  And he started doing it to me.  I'm like, that's assault, sir.  Don't lecture me on the law.  And he's putting me in his ass.  And it hurt. ",
