Honestly, this stuff, you just can't make it up.  Just when you think you've heard the craziest stuff... that this man in particular can come out with, he surprises you again.

I'm one that's always liked to keep up with the news.  You like to find out how things are with our brothers in certain parts of the world.  For instance, the Hurricane Florence, it's filled with all this other garbage.  In fact, last night I started for about three minutes watching the 6.30 news and said, forget it.  Just filled with it.  So the subject we're going to have this morning a discussion about, while sobering, I hope you find it encouraging.  I thought we'd discuss the final end of God's enemies.  So it can be very encouraging, albeit sobering.  And to help us with it, there's a beautiful expression here in the 37th Psalm.  So find that 37th Psalm.  and how encouraging to meditate on this beautiful verse, verse 20.  But the wicked will perish, the enemies of Jehovah will vanish like glorious pastures, they will vanish like smoke.  So, since they're Jehovah's enemies and Jehovah's our best friend, that means they're our enemies.  How we look forward to these enemies of Jehovah, our enemies perishing, Vanishing like smoke. ",

That's beautiful to him.  And make no mistake, that's what this is about.  This is not about enemies of Jehovah.

But I just wanted to pause there and comment on this extraordinary reasoning.  Tony is here referencing the teaching about 1919, about 1919 being the year when essentially the Watchtower Society or the leaders of the Watchtower Society attained a favoured position as the Israel of God.  In other words, he's saying, well, in 1919, obviously, our organization was chosen to be God's faithful slave.  He then goes on to describe the new light in the 1930s about there being essentially two-tier Christianity.  The organization from 1935 onwards decided it wasn't just looking for people who would rule in heaven.  the 144,000.  They were also extending an invitation to millions of people who would live on the earth, who would survive Armageddon.  And he's saying that the extraordinary growth, the millions and millions who have joined the organization... are evidence. ",

Even when I was one of Jehovah's Witnesses, How can you point to the size of your organization, the fact that you have millions of followers or millions of believers, how can you point to that as proof that you are being blessed by God?  and then dismiss the size of other religions, dismiss the size of other denominations, other creeds, and say, oh, well, they're just being misled by Satan.  They may have more followers than us, but they're all misled.  We are the ones with the truth, with the favoured position as God's faithful slave.  It's having it both ways.  It's manifestly flawed reasoning.  And he's also there pointing to the growth of the organization as a reason for Satan to be angered or infuriated. ",

            "text": "Now it's interesting.  The Isaiah prophecy book had some sobering comments and find, if you would please, the very last chapter of Isaiah and the very last verse in Isaiah.  Isaiah 66, and we're going to read verse 24.  And they will go out and look on the carcasses of the men who rebelled against me.  for the worms on them will not die, and their fire will not be extinguished, and they will become something repulsive to all people.  So I'm making reference to all these that rebel against Jehovah God as enemies.  What makes this even more of an impact is the fact that Christ Jesus likely had this verse in mind when he said these well-known words, well-known to Jehovah's Witnesses anyway, in Mark chapter 9.  And if your eye makes you stumble, throw it away.  It is better for you to enter one-eyed into the kingdom of God than to be thrown with two eyes into Gehenna.  where the maggot does not die and the fire is not put out.  So the Isaiah prophecy book mentions that if, as this Jewish scholar suggests, Gehenna was used for the disposal of refuse and carcasses of those deemed unworthy of burial, fire would be a suitable means of eliminating such refuse.  Now this point, what the fire did not consume, the maggots would.  Now, I don't know if you know much about maggots, but you see a whole bunch of them.  It's just not a pleasant sight.  But what a fitting picture of the final end of all of God's enemies.  Sobering, yet something we look forward to.  However, The apostates and the enemies of Jehovah would say, well, that's gruesome.  That's despicable.  You teach your people these things?  No, God teaches his people these things.  This is what he's foretelling.  And frankly, for friends of Jehovah God, how reassuring that they're finally going to be gone.  All these despicable enemies that have just reproached Jehovah's name, destroyed, never ever to live again.  Now, it's not that we rejoice in someone's death, but when it comes to God's enemies, finally, they're out of the way, especially these despicable apostates who at one point had dedicated their life to God, and then they joined forces with Satan, the devil, the chief apostate of all time.  So, in conclusion, let's go back to that opening psalm that we looked at here.  Just to help this verse stay in your mind, we hope, verse 20, just to emphasize this, but the wicked will perish, the enemies of Jehovah will vanish like glorious pastures, particularly.  they will vanish like smoke.  So I thought this would be a nice memory aid, this verse stay in the mind.  Here's what Jehovah's promising.  That's Jehovah's enemies.  They're going to vanish like smoke. ",

            "text": "Where do you even begin with that?  I mean, of course, in the context of what's happening at the moment as well, for me personally, any of you who have seen my most recent or one of my most recent videos will know that I am being accused by the organization of hate speech against Jehovah's Witnesses just for making these videos, just for being a whistleblower, just for flagging abusive teachings and policies.  They have the gall to accuse me, Lloyd Evans, of being a perpetrator of hate speech.  And here you have a governing body member, Anthony Morris, relishing, relishing the destruction of people who don't agree with him, of people who have left his religion, of former Jehovah's Witnesses.  Apparently this isn't hate speech, but me criticising Tony is hate speech.  I mean, I ask you, Could the hypocrisy be more obvious?  I did want to briefly comment on him referring to the Isaiah's prophecy books from the perspective of a Watchtower geek, which I sort of am.  I found this interesting because these books, released in 2000 and 2001... are brimming with a form of reasoning that the organization has since distanced itself from.  The organization is distancing itself from this whole idea of types and anti-types, of everything in the Bible or particularly the prophetic books of the Bible, having an initial fulfillment and then a grander or later fulfillment.  That's what these books were all about.  These are officially obsolete now.  These are old light.  And yet when it suits Tony, he can bring them back from the grave and quote from them because, oh, I like this bit about worms.  I like this bit about people I don't like, people who speak against me and my authority, being riddled with worms because they've been destroyed by Jehovah.  And then he links in the verse in the Gospels about these being in fact maggots.  And he talks about Gehenna.  The guy is getting off on the idea, for want of a better word.  of his critics being slaughtered, of his critics decomposing, and the glee with which he relates this information.  And at the end there, I mean, the bit with the match.  He just cannot wait for what in his deluded mind is only a matter of time.  He cannot wait for all of his critics to vanish like smoke.  And he was really enjoying doing that with the match.  It was kind of unsettling or unnerving to hear people in the audience. ",

It was this chap and people like him who are leading the organisation and quite frankly doesn't it show in the organisation's teachings and beliefs and policies.  So that's all I have for you.  The situation with ICSA and hate speech is ongoing.  I am currently fighting to get permission from ICSA to publicly divulge The eight-page dossier of quotes that the organisation has assembled.  from watching my public statements and comments, I'm currently in the process of getting official clearance from ICSA to make that information public.  And as soon as I get that clearance, it's probably now going to be spread across two more videos because there's quite a bit to go through.  I do actually have the documents.  I'm just under a confidentiality undertaking that prevents me from talking about them publicly.  But hopefully it's just a matter of time until I can talk about them publicly.  And then... You'll get the full contrast between what we've just seen and Watchtower's idea of hate speech.  In other words, anyone criticising them.  But that's everything I have to share with you.
