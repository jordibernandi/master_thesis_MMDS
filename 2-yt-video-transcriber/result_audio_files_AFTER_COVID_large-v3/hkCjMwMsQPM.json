You fall.  i'm dead.  i really don't want to walk over this bridge.  i need to know it's safe now.  compare the three responses from the guide.  i have faith that this bridge is safe.  i hope that this bridge is safe.  i trust that this bridge is safe.  now.  if he said to me i hope that this bridge is safe there's no freaking way i'm crossing that bridge.  But the larger point of this is that people use these words as synonyms, but these are just simply not synonyms.  They're just not.  You can pretend they're synonyms all you want, but the fact that you can use them in some contexts and circumstances and not in others, have that talk of faith being pretending to know something you don't know, and that faith claims are knowledge claims.  I think it's when you're at your pastor and you say, He says, I'm going to lay hands on you.  And you say, is it going to work?  He says, you know, I have faith it's going to work.  I hope it's going to work.  I have confidence is another one.  I have confidence that it's going to work.  I trust that it's going to work.

My hope was justified.  if you take that leap of hope in this case i trust the bridge will hold my weight.  i can trust it and i can go out and halfway through.  i can find that my trust was unwarranted.  i'm just too heavy.  my body is three times the size maybe of an average person from that area.  what's interesting though?  that faith is probably one of.  i almost tweeted this like last week coincidentally But this is nothing new.  Faith is one of the most slipperiest words ever invented.  And I don't know if it was intentional or not.
