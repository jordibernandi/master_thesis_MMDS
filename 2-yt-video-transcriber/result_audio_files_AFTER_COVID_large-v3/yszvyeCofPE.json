And I have to tell you that there were a variety of women who are very concerned about law enforcement and felt like, the real directness of President Trump saying, look, I am not going to put up with this.  This is coming to the suburbs.  And Joe Biden's inability to talk and articulate that he is focused on law and order.  He couldn't say the word.  He didn't know of any law enforcement agencies that endorsed him.  This rung really strong with these women.
