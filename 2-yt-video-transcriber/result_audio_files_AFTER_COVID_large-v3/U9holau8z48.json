            "text": "Hello family, Minister Missy here.  I hope and pray that everyone is staying masked up as we go through this pandemic.  I've been meaning to make this video for quite a while.  First off, I would like to thank all of our online members and partners of Destin Ministries and Stephen Dorby Ministries.  You guys are faithful in your monetary support and in your viewing of the live stream weekly services and traveling to Destin Ministries to fellowship with us in person.  We had our 2020 conference dates set, but COVID-19 came and changed the world's plans.  Once we get past this COVID, Stephen Dorby Ministries will again hold conferences.  We are all looking forward to traveling to be able to see and shake the hands of our brothers and hug the necks of our sisters as we rejoice in serving the Lord together.  The one thing that the COVID pandemic, whether it's man-made or not, has shown me is just how important fellowship is and how we as Christian believers need each other and how our light should be shining brightly because this pandemic has given us the opportunity to operate in what we say we believe.  This pandemic has also shown those who are not Christians because they walked away.  They never thought that they would have to actually serve in the crisis.  But praise be to God, Stephen Dorby Ministries and Destin Ministries, we have never shut down our church, nor have we closed our bowels of compassion.  How can you if you are a Christian?  We only became larger during this pandemic because this is the only time where a real Christian shines.  We are doing a lot of great things at this ministry locally.  We have food giveaways.  We know that our brothers and sisters are in need right now, and we want to make sure that we are able to be able to help in the areas that's needed.  And we definitely can help with supplying food to those who are in need.  Every year, we do a back-to-school giveaway in the memory of Pastor Stephen Darby.  We don't care whose children it is.  It doesn't matter if they're saved or not saved.  We want to be a blessing.  They receive a backpack filled with school supplies.  We have been doing this for three straight years.  Stephen Dorby Ministry supports an all-boys school.  It's called the West End Boys School, located in Louisville, Kentucky.  You can get on their website to find out more about them.  Pastor Dorby would have loved this if he was alive.  It was started for our young black boys who seemed to fall through the cracks in the public school system.  This school has black and white boys and young men.  Some students have home environments, which is too toxic for the child, so the school offers safe housing on site.  They have dorm rooms for the children who feel like it would be safer to be at the school than at home.  but they have housing there on site for those students.  These students are taught to respect others.  They are taught dignity and honor.  Their grade scores improve.  They are required to wear shirts and ties because when you look good, you feel good.  These young men learn different trades.  They learn different life skills.  They learn welding, carpentry, 3D computer science making.  It's a whole lot of skills that they learn, but they learn different life skills to prepare them for life.  These young men graduate and are accepted into different colleges.  The West End Boys School just unveiled a plaque in memory of Pastor Stephen Dorby.  Stephen Dorby Ministries purchased all the flooring that was needed for the floors at the school.  It is a blessing to be able to partner every year with this school and support these young black boys as they become men and hopefully men of God and one day someone's future husband.  Stephen Dorby Ministries just had our skating party and we had a good time while social distancing.  Amen.  We had a blessed time in the Lord doing a skate.  We enjoyed it.  We really enjoyed ourselves and we're going to have many more.  And hopefully the Corona be gone so that you all can come down and come down to the skating parties also.  We are going to get back to holding the conferences.  The single mingles conference once the COVID is over.  Single, single mingle conferences where single men, we create an atmosphere for the single men and the single women to come and meet each other.  Other Christians meeting each other.  Where you find that at?  That's a blessing that we can facilitate that amongst our brothers and sisters in Christ that's looking for godly spouses.  But where can you find that at?  Nowhere.  We donated Thanksgiving dinners to families, and it didn't matter whether they celebrated Thanksgiving or not.  It doesn't matter.  We're not getting stuck off of a name.  But we donated dinners to families that was in need.  We wanted to be a blessing to others.  We were able to help 21 families with a whole turkey and all the fixings.  They just needed to cook everything.  And everyone that received their food box was blessed to see what was inside their boxes.  They were blessed to have a real Thanksgiving dinner.  And we will be donating Christmas dinners to any family in need.  Families are hurting right now, y'all.  They are hurting financially right now.  And I want to make sure that we put our money where our mouth is.  I would like to give a shout out to everyone of you.  When you hear Minister Missy talk about what we are doing here at Destin Ministries, you go online and immediately say, I want to be a part of being a blessing to others.  And you begin to give, which only makes me find more people to bless.  It's a blessing to be able to bless others.  So again, a shout out to every one of you who's so into the outreaches here at Destin Ministries through Stephen Dorby Ministries.  I would like to give a shout out to our prayer team.  We have an awesome prayer team here at Destin Ministries.  Our prayer team is here Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays.  We ain't never going to stop praying.  I know it's ebonics, but we ain't never going to stop praying here at this ministry.  That's the very thing that most Christians don't do no more.  And that's why there's no power in most of the churches.  People don't pray, but we pray up in here.  I want to give a shout out to our praise team and our band.  They help usher in the anointing and the worship.  Amen.  They have to be on one accord to be able to get up here every Sunday and play their part.  They're essential.  I want to give a shout out to our camera crew and our IT people.  These are men.  These are the people y'all don't see behind the scenes.  These are the men and the young men that's on these cameras, that's working down in the office with the live stream.  We have men who are doing this.  I want to give a shout out to them for what they do.  They're playing their part.  I would like to thank our greeters, the men and women who are on that door greeting others as soon as they walk into the service, to church.  You're already getting a friendly smile and a how you doing this morning.  That goes a long way when you ain't never, when you're coming to somewhere for the first time.  Thank you, greeters.  I would like to thank our behind the scenes support staff.  We couldn't do this without our support staff behind the scenes.  See, I'm talking about people.  It's just more, ministry is more than giving a word on Wednesdays and Sundays.  It's wherever you are, you playing your part in that ministry.  Whether it's cleaning the restrooms, taking out the trash, that's ministry and you're needed.  So thank you to our behind the scenes support crew.  Pastor Dorby was a great man of God.  He was a general in the natural and in the spirit.  And I was blessed to serve under him.  My children and I are making sure to secure this godly man's legacy.  Pastor even said when he was preaching, my legacy is secured because of the way he taught me and our children.  He taught us well here at Destin Ministry, and that's why our ministry never split.  This is why this ministry didn't split.  Most ministries do.  When the pastor dies, most ministries do split, but this one never split.  Pastor Dorby was such a thorough teacher.  We were able to carry on in what he said to do.  For all of you who don't know, we have people getting online, making videos to defame this man of God's character.  In his name, adding Pastor Steve to their titles so that they can get a hit, a click, and a like.  There are people who stole Pastor Steve's identity, sorting up TikTok accounts and Facebook accounts and other different accounts using his image, our son Steve  Jr.'s  music and Pastor Steve's name.  that was never official from us.  Anytime you see a video that's not... And I'm going to give you more information on all of our social media platforms and our names.  If it ain't the real, why go with an imposter?  But these people were getting online to defame... They're going to wait until he died and want to defame him now and want to steal his identity now because... Their word, nobody will listen to their word, but they knew his name draws millions.  So we are now on all these social media platforms to give you the real Pastor Stephen Darby.  Our Instagram name, we're on Instagram.  Our Instagram name is Stephen Darby Ministries.  We are on Facebook.  Our Facebook name is Stephen Darby Ministries and Stephen Darby Senior.  We are on TikTok.  Our TikTok name is The Real Pastor Stephen Darby.  Our email address is sdministries at mail.com.  Our website is stephendarbyministries.com.  Our YouTube channel is Stephen Darby Ministries.  And our cash app is Dollar Sign S Darby Ministries.  Please refer to the official social media platforms that was just listed to contact us.  And know that any other channel, video, social media platform is an imposter.  There are liars and there are thieves.  As we go into this new year, we will be uploading some of our anointed worship.  Our worship is anointed here at Destiny Ministries.  We love to come to worship.  This anointed worship is what's missing in most churches today.  But our worship is anointed, and we're going to start uploading worship to our channel.  Another thing that we plan to introduce is Facebook Live.  We will be incorporating this pretty soon.  I just wanted to share some of the things that we are doing here at Destiny Ministries.  A lot of people didn't know if we had shut down or not, but our ministry is stronger, larger, and more effective now.  Thank you to our online family and friends.  We are happy when you travel down to us and when we are able to travel to you.  Until we see each other again, be blessed and stay masked up. ",
