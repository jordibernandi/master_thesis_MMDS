            "text": "This is a guided meditation created to help you achieve a relaxed and alert state.  Do not listen to this recording while driving or operating machinery.  Only listen when you can safely relax.  Practice this meditation at a time when you will not be disturbed.  Turn off your phone and any notifications and try to ensure you have a private space where you will not be interrupted.  It is best to use headphones if you can and either sit or lie down in a position you find comfortable with your arms by your sides.  Use the next minute to ensure you are ready to relax and are in a position you find agreeable for the duration of the meditation.  Leave all of the outside world behind you for this session.  In the silence of stillness, we seek deeper knowledge.  By clearing the mind, we seek the primordial wisdom that comes to us on a level that is beyond rational thought.  Whatever challenge the outside world presents to us, those challenges will still be there when we return to them.  But for now, we train the mind to become stronger, to help us face our challenges with greater confidence.  We seek a clear and calm mind, alert but free of thought.  We will observe but not analyze.  now the meditation will begin.  close your eyes inhale deeply filling your lungs completely with life-giving breath and hold it in feeling the oxygen move through your body and now exhale fully.  repeat again inhale deeply Hold it in and as you exhale, release all the tension in your body along with the breath.  Allow your breathing to return to normal and simply observe your breath.  Notice that you are breathing in.  Notice that you are breathing out.  Follow your breath in your own time, concentrating on the sensations of the flowing air.  Moving away from the breath, take your attention to your toes.  Be aware of how they are feeling.  Allow them to relax.  Now bring your attention to the soles of your feet.  Become aware of any sensations there and allow them to relax too.  Bring your awareness to the heels of your feet.  Notice how they feel.  Let any tension you notice here simply disappear with the exhalation of your breath.  Now move your focus to your calves.  Feel what is happening here.  Notice the muscles, and again, allow them to relax, releasing all tension with the breath.  Take your attention to your thighs.  Notice any sensations here.  Feel any tension.  Simply let go.  Let go.  Let go.  Imagine you can take your focus deeper inside your thighs.  Notice that you can feel the deeper muscles inside letting go too.  Imagine you can feel all the way down to the thigh bone, relaxing deeper as you go.  Perhaps you can even feel inside the thigh bone, right down into the marrow of the bone.  Imagine you can allow the bone marrow to relax too.  Feel it happening.  Already you are in a deeply relaxed state.  Now take your attention to your pelvis.  Feel any sensations in this area and breathing in deeply and breathing out deeply.  Let any tensions simply fade away.  Move your awareness to your stomach and lower back.  Draw your breath deeply into your lower abdomen and exhale all your tension.  Imagine you can let your attention go deep inside your torso.  Allow all the organs to relax.  Everything is just easing off, breathing in and breathing out.  Now take your attention to your chest and upper back.  Notice the gentle rise and fall of your breathing.  It is happening all on its own.  You do not need to do anything.  You can simply let this area relax and know that you are fine.  Bring your awareness now to your shoulders.  Feel them letting go as your attention rests there.  With each breath, the muscles loosen and relax.  Allow the tension to release little by little with each breath in your own time, breathing in and breathing out.  Now become aware of your throat and the back of your neck.  With each breath, let any tightness here melt away.  Breathing in, find the tension.  Breathing out, let it go.  Bring your awareness to your jaw and allow it to relax.  Allow your mouth to open slightly and relax your entire face.  Move your attention to the back of your eyes.  Let your awareness rest here for a moment.  Allow the eyes to relax and loosen your forehead muscles.  Finally, bring your attention to the area of your nostrils and upper lip.  Feel the air moving here as you breathe in and breathe out.  Notice how the air feels.  Take several breaths in your own time, paying attention to the sensations in this area.  You are now in a very relaxed state.  Tensions have eased off and you can simply be.  Notice that you have become very still.  You can just rest.  Observe your breath rising and falling.  You may feel a comfortable tingling throughout your body.  This is your body healing and repairing.  The more you relax, the more you are able to relax.  It is very natural, the most natural thing in the world.  You are simply coming back to where you are, to who you are.  feeling sensing and knowing being aware of your own presence you are here now feeling the inner stillness the stillness that is always there beneath everything else timeless and eternal.  Know that having accessed this state you find it easier to access it again.  Each time it becomes easier for you to find this stillness because it is always there for you.  Take a few moments to observe the stillness and to observe your own being.  Now it is time to return back to ordinary awareness.  Gradually bring your attention to the room you are in.  Becoming aware of your fingers and toes, wiggle them slightly.  Breathe in more fully if you need to, drawing breath deeply into your abdomen and gently stretch your body.  Open your eyes when you are ready and face the rest of your day with renewed vitality. ",
