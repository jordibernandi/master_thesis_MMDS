It was a lot louder and scary.  Amy Reid caught this flash of light in what sounded like an explosion on her home security camera last week.  The boom shook her entire home.  I thought I would just see somebody's house had blown up.  You know, I was expecting I'd see fire in the sky.  Even after neighbors like Reed say they've been reporting this almost every night.  They said they've definitely been getting all the calls from our area for all these different nights and several of them each night.

For weeks, police have been getting reports of these loud explosions.  This mysterious exploding sound... is sending shockwaves throughout this Elk Grove neighborhood.  Just heard all of a sudden this loud boom.  Nate Sanchez says he felt vibrations.  I feel like the reason we woke up was more because we felt a little bit of a shaking than anything else.  For several weeks, random loud booms have been rattling different Elk Grove neighborhoods.  Chris Carpenter says it's not the first time she's heard the alarming explosive sounds.  Just random, just every once in a while.  Well, this is alarming and it's a mystery at this point.  What's the best guess at what's causing these blasts?  Well, right now, because it's such a mystery and these reports are pretty sporadic, although most of them on the southeast side of town, right now it's still unknown what these random blasts are.  Kilauea volcano in Hawaii.  Look at this.  This eruption started with an earthquake on Sunday on the volcano's south side.  It's the worst eruption since 2018.  It shows lava erupting from a fissure on the left side of your screen and a lava... To the right of it, a lava nato, that is, over the right of it, over that lava lake.  Is a rapidly evolving situation.  A giant plume of steam and ash could be seen rising from the glowing orange crater.  People who lived downwind being warned to stay inside to avoid the ash and to be prepared to leave.  There have been no early reports of injury or death.  Croatia's most powerful earthquake in more than a century has resulted in the death of seven people.  For a second straight day central Croatia rocked by a powerful earthquake.  Just on Monday there was a another earthquake which also had its epicenter near the town of Petrinje.  And an emergency begins.  Hundreds of kilometers away, MPs in neighboring Slovenia also felt the force of the quake.  Several smaller aftershocks were felt across the Balkans, as far away as Hungary.  The epicenter of the earthquake was around 50 kilometers southeast of the Croatian capital of Zagreb.  The force could be felt right across the country.  Unfortunately, the way the year started, it kind of ends the same way.  People in the capital Zagreb can sympathize.

Quietly for a lot of us, San Francisco and Marin feeling this 3.6 earthquake this morning.  And Darren, you have been tracking some of it.  We're hearing that this was on the San Andreas Fault.  What can you tell us?  Well, that map that we just showed right off the top here a minute ago, you saw that straight red line running through it?  That was the San Andreas.  So in one sense, we can think of this as very good news because a 3.6 is minor.  And a 3.6 means it relieved a little bit of pressure on the San Andreas Fault.  And just to kind of put it in perspective, that sits just about six and a half to seven miles exactly due west of the Golden Gate Bridge.  So it was like if you were sailing out under the Golden Gate Bridge, about five to six miles out there.  It's like directly south of Muir Beach.  That's where the epicenter was.  The San Andreas Fault runs right underneath that part of the Pacific Ocean.

You can see the enormous crater that appeared in the early hours of Wednesday.  Around 700 people have been evacuated from the area.  And can you help us to understand, is this an area that is prone to this?  Is it because of the particularly cold weather?  What's the thinking behind why this has happened?  This is an area that has an unstable ground with a lot of this kind of mud that can be put into motion with a lot of rain.  But it hasn't happened before in this scale, not at all.
