            "text": "Hi there, it's your girl Z from transvoicelessons.com and in this video I just want to give everybody an update on what I've been up to and where Trans Voice Lessons is headed.  So first off, my health.  In July and August I started experiencing a lot of gastrointestinal health issues.  I was in a lot of pain and I was having a lot of problems.  so I took two and a half weeks off and I focused on my health.  I changed my whole diet around and I started exercising more and I changed a lot about my lifestyle.  And I'm happy to say that I've pretty much got all of the symptoms of that in remission.  There have been two times since mid-August where I felt those symptoms come back a little bit, but generally speaking, I've done a lot better there.  That was like one of the first health problems I've ever really had in my life.  It was really scary and I wasn't sure what would happen, but I'm really happy to say that I'm feeling a lot better.  But if that wasn't a crisis enough, A month after that, Oregon ended up catching on fire, right?  So I'm sure you all heard about some of the wildfires.  Well, the air here was so bad.  It felt like I was breathing glass.  It would irritate me.  It was hard to shower because I had to take a mask off.  I mean, I was living in my house like using a KN95 mask and I had multiple air purifiers going and I vacuum sealed my windows, but it still wasn't enough.  So I ended up evacuating my home and I ended up staying in a hotel for a few days.  So I had to miss lessons and I wasn't able to edit or get any videos done during that time.  So it's been a really frustrating last two months, but I feel like I'm finally starting to get back to a normal pace where things are starting to happen on my end.  Now, through all of that though, I have some exciting things that I've been working on.  So first off, I have an apprentice.  There is now another teacher at Trans Voice Lessons that I'm working with and training and collaborating with.  Their name is Nick.  They are an agender individual who is highly capable of doing a good feminine voice.  a good masculine voice, good singing voice, and very experienced across the board with singing in particular.  I've been working with them and collaborating and training them in speech alteration, and we are going to be working together moving forward in the future.  One of the most exciting things that we are working on is a 12 week long intensive voice feminization class.  So this will be just like an online class like that you'd have in college or something.  And we will have 12 90 minute sessions and we will go over everything from top to bottom.  Both me and Nick will be teaching those lessons and we'll be playing off each other, splitting up into breakout groups and working with people individually throughout that process.  So I think it'll be a really great opportunity and it's a way that we can start to reach more people and create more availability while bringing the cost down and continuing to provide the best possible education in voice alteration.  Solutions like a group class or a course or a webinar are things that trans voice lessons is going to be moving more towards in the future.  We have hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people waiting to work with us.  And unfortunately there is just very little availability.  So to try and increase the availability, this class will allow us to take on a lot more students.  The addition of a new teacher will allow us to take on a lot more students at a lower cost.  And we will be working towards webinars, which will be like open population themed long sessions, two to three hour long, maybe once every two months or so.  So we're going to be trying to increase our availability in a lot of different ways to meet the demand of everybody who needs voice lessons.  I put out my call for apprenticeship almost a year ago and I got tons of amazing submissions and I'm incredibly thankful to everybody who submitted their applications.  I'm extremely excited because I feel like I found the perfect person.  We communicate very clearly, we work together really well, they have helped inspire me and I've helped inspire them and our values are very in line with what we are trying to do.  Along with all of this new stuff coming from Trans Voice Lessons, I have a lot of exciting videos planned for the future.  It was very difficult for me to stay on top of video production in the last month, simply because of the wildfires plus my illness setting me back about four weeks worth of my work, okay?  So I'm finally starting to get caught up, which is why I'm making this video.  I'm really looking forward to get back to making YouTube content.  I have one really awesome video that's on my editing desk right now that I'm finishing up, and I have two more scripts that I've already made for new videos.  Additionally, I will likely do a live stream towards the end of this month, maybe on Halloween, so be there for that if you'd like to join.  And if all of that wasn't cool enough already, I'm really excited to give all of you a glossary.  I get a lot of comments on my YouTube video about people not understanding the terminology that I'm using or what I'm saying, and so here is a glossary to help with that.  This is a document that I've been working on for a while, Now, eventually, I would like to make this a multimedia glossary where there's audio files and there are pictures for most of the entries.  But unfortunately, I sort of fell off and I started focusing on other things.  So this is the current state that it's in.  It's like 17 pages.  There's a lot of lessons there for you to gain.  So please enjoy that and have that on me.  So thank you all.  So in summary, one, my health is doing a lot better.  Two, I definitely don't recommend to people to breathe toxic wildfire smoke for too long.  Three, I now have a new instructor and educator working with me.  Four, I'm gonna be hosting a voice class, several voice classes, starting in late December or early January.  Five, I'm gonna be creating webinars and other group lesson environments.  And six, now you all have a glossary of terms.  So thank you all so much for the support.  I will never be able to thank you enough.  So that's all for this video.
