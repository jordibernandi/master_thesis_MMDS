And that's a lot of property, which means Terry does a lot of stuff on his property.  He lives there with his son, he has a tenant who lives there, and he farms and hunts on the property.  Now all of that is private activity.  And so Terry has put up a gate and a no trespassing sign so that people who he doesn't invite can't get onto the property.  But Tennessee has decided to ignore that no trespassing sign and to treat his private land like public property. ",

But under federal law, at least under the U.S.  Supreme Court's interpretation of the Fourth Amendment, Police officers, government agents don't have to get a warrant to snoop around and search on your private land.  There's a distinction drawn in Supreme Court precedent between the home and what's called the curtilage, which is the area immediately surrounding your home, and the rest of the real property you might own.  And the point of this case is to say that the Tennessee courts and the Tennessee Constitution don't follow that doctrine. ",

So areas that are considered associated with intimate activities of the home.  So something that would be protected under a lot of federal cases, for instance, would be like your front yard, or maybe a shed where you do activities closely associated with home life.  that's kind of adjacent to your yard.  It's covered, that kind of thing.  But the rest of your property, big open fields where you might farm or hunt, even if it's fenced, even if there are no trespassing signs, that stuff doesn't get protection, at least under the federal doctrine.

So one was installed about a few hundred yards after the gate, and the officers continued to drive several hundred more yards down a private road that Terry owns until they reached a second tree, and then they installed another camera in that tree.  What they're relying on, I think, is this federal open fields doctrine.  So there's a state statute in Tennessee that says that game wardens can snoop around your property without a warrant to enforce the state's hunting laws.  And I think that the basis for that statute, the reason Tennessee thinks it can adopt a statute like that is this federal open fields doctrine.  And the point of this case is that we want to establish in Tennessee that doctrine doesn't apply. ",
