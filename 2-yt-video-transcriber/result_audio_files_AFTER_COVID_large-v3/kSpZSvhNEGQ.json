            "text": "We got 330 million Americans.  Census was just completed.  We got 15 million undocumented people living here.  So that's a 345 number.  That's a lot of folks.  The first thing that's going to happen is the 15 million undocumented will get amnesty if the Senate goes Democrat and Biden's elected.  So, like that.  Second thing that's going to happen is going to be a new border policy, much more lenient.  They're going to say it's for asylum seekers, but that is just an invitation for everybody in the world to come here and say, I want asylum.  Somebody's mean to me back in Honduras, and there's a gang after me.  All right, so right away, I mean right away, the Democratic ranks will be swollen by... 15, 20 new citizens eventually.  It's not going to happen overnight, but that's what they want, the Democratic Party wants.  So that's number one.  Number two, they're going to mess around with the Supreme Court somehow because they don't want six justices doing the bidding of traditional Americans, which I don't think they'd do anyway, but that's what the Democrats are.  So there's gonna start to mess around.  That gets complicated because it'll be litigated.  So whatever the Democrats try to do, there's gonna go into litigation.  Someone will sue and the Supreme Court will have to hear a lot of these cases.  Then there'll be rattling about Puerto Rico being a state and Washington DC.  I don't think that's coming fast.  But what will come fast is the tax rise.  Now, I don't know how the stock market is going to react to a Biden victory.  I don't know.  All right.  No one does.  But you will get February, March, a substantial tax rise on corporations and affluent Americans.  And it'll be retroactive back to a date.  Now, I don't think they can make it retroactive back to the Trump administration.  So it'll probably be January, right?  And that'll roil the economy.  Roil is R-O-I-L.  It'll roil it.  So you're going to have, if Biden wins, you're going to have illegal immigration.  Boom.  You're going to have tax rise.  Boom.  You're going to have a lot of social programs.  So Trump did a lot of executive orders.  They're all going to go.  And there'll be a lot more regulations on oil, all of that.  And then you're going to start to see the unintended consequences of all of that.  In the meantime, it's going to be a really nasty, nasty media payback.  Trump will be hauled in and they'll do stuff to him and everybody who served in his administration.  and commentators, and it'll be really nasty.  It's not like, oh, we won, we're Democrats, let's just get everybody together.  That's not going to happen.  It's going to be bad.  And the political correctness, the totalitarianism on college campuses, all of that is going to go through the roof.  Cancel culture, Me Too, crazy.  The first six months here is going to be really not good.  So if you have a long, you can't even travel because of COVID, it's going to say, take a trip to Nepal somewhere and sit out the first six months.  Now, I'm going to be here to tell you what's going to happen and how you protect yourself.  That's how this program is going to function.  So we're going to say, all right, here's what they're doing.  here is what they're doing.  there is what you have to do, because there are going to be ways to protect yourself.  But it's going to be bad.  It is.  If the Democrats sweep, it's going to be bad for two years because there's going to be so much damage done in those two years that in 2022, when you have the midterms, Republicans will come back and control Congress.  I mean, Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer are fanatics.  Fanatics.  And then you're going to have the Green New Deal.  That'll take a little longer to start spending trillions of dollars to alter global warming.  But Biden's going to have to do it.  And then his cabinet position, you're going to have a new attorney general.  that's going to be like Obama's attorney general holder.  You're not going to enforce the law.  Crime is going to go crazy everywhere because they're not going to enforce the law.  And the reason they're not going to enforce the law is because the progressive left, the far left, believes that criminals are victims, not Not the real victims, the people who get robbed or murdered.  They're not the real victims.  The criminals are the victims.  Because slavery and all of the terrible things the United States has done to minorities made them commit the crimes.  That's what they believe.  It should be restorative justice, no punishment.  No, we'll sit them down.  I'm telling you, don't do that again, okay?  So the crime wave is going to be... Now, am I painting a black picture?  You bet I am.  That's why I told you.  Couldn't possibly vote for Biden and Harris.  Now, on the other side, Donald Trump's elected.  Nothing much is going to change.  Okay?  The economy will stay the way that Trump wants it, market-based.  Vaccine for COVID will arrive.  Some of you won't take it, but it's your choice.  But that'll lessen the COVID hysteria.  Foreign policy, stay the same.  Trade deals is what Trump does.  I don't see a big disruption anywhere other than the Justice Department.  So if Trump wins, he's going to fire Ray, the head of the FBI, he's out.  Probably the CIA leader will go.  And a number of other law enforcement situations, they'll go.  I don't know what's going to happen to Barr because the Durham report should have been out.  Now, remember that Biden can't stop that.  Even if he's elected, he can't stop that report from coming out.  But what is it going to show?  It's going to show that there was corruption and law enforcement agencies tried to hurt Donald Trump.  But if Donald Trump's not in the White House, people are going to yawn.  Hunter Biden, if Trump's elected, that'll follow through.  If his father is elected, it won't.  There it is.  OK.  And a lot of people think that Hunter Biden in this situation is going to influence the vote.  Maybe a little, but it's not nearly to the level of COVID is.  So that's the assessment.  And after the election, I'll get into it in a more micro way.  But, you know, when you're talking to your family and friends, and I think most of you watching me now, you guys are so educated and informed, you know what you're going to vote for.  But when you're talking to other people, maybe, you know, just say, look, there's going to be a big, big change that you're not going to like.  With Trump, not so much.  Not so much.
