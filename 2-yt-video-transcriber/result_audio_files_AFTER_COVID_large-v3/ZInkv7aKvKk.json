But during your time as Attorney General, you have consistently undermined democracy, undermined the Constitution, and undermined the health, safety, and well-being of the American people, all to personally benefit Donald Trump.  Now, you just testified that there's no mechanism for a president to contest an election that has clearly been won by the opponent.  Mr.  Attorney General, what will you do if Donald Trump loses the election on November 3rd, but refuses to leave office on January 20th? ",
