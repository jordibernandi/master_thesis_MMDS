            "text": "Over the weekend, there was controversy over whether Donald Trump is taking it all seriously.  Not specifically just the coronavirus, but the fact that he is president.  Is he actually engaged in his job?  Is he working?  And he lost it when a New York Times report implied that perhaps he is not.  So I wanna read you just a few excerpts from it and then we'll give you his reaction.  The report said President Trump arrives in the Oval Office these days as late as noon when he is usually in a sour mood after his morning marathon of television.  He's been up in the White House master bedroom as early as 5 AM watching Fox News, then CNN with a dollop of MSNBC thrown in for rage viewing.  Although it seems like the CNN stuff would probably also be rage viewing.  He's angry even with Fox, an old security blanket, for not portraying him as he would like to be seen.  And he makes time to watch Governor Andrew Cuomo's briefings from New York, closely monitoring for a sporadic compliment or snipe.  So look, I get that if Cuomo praises him, he's gonna wanna see that, that's good.  Wanting to be praised when you're an incredibly vain person, I understand.  But think about spending your morning so focused on the news.  But even if you're gonna be focused on the news, to be focused on the news specifically to try to see who's being mean to you, to see who's insulting you.  And the thing is, it's not like.  I don't sort of understand the inclination.  I'm in a much worse mood when I go live on the damage report if I've spent a lot of time on Twitter that morning.  But I'm an idiot and it ain't seven hours.  Some pretty significant differences.  I'm also not president, by the way.  That's three important differences right there.  But he is waking up Francesca, spending, let's say, three to seven hours watching cable news, getting into these little impotent rage moments.  mode, and then doing the press conference.  And importantly, a lot of sources are saying that he no longer takes part in the briefings before the press conference.  That's one of the reasons why he's saying crazy things when he finally gets there.  But this is apparently the mode he's in.  He's spending his days once again, eating food in bed, watching cable news for literally hours, morning, noon, and night.  And by the way, during the worst pandemic that has hit the United States in some time. ",

Like if I were a therapist, I would be like, And you're like, sir, you're the president once and once again.  I just feel like he's just not living his best life.  And if only he could, then maybe Americans could literally just live in general, you know.  But I also am like.  I don't ever want to imagine Donald Trump in the morning outside of his like.  slithering into that suit and putting on his little heels that he does where he tilts forward and he looks left disgustingly huge as he is.  Just imagine a crumpled little sheet in between Trump's like pasty pink legs as he's watching. ",

Okay, look, the reason that this matters is because supposedly if you listen to the people who are closest to him, his focus is on how his performance on the virus is measured in the news media and the extent to which history will blame him.  And the thing is that is baked in, we're not gonna be able to change that.  But what I keep trying to say, we were just talking about it, is, and he's never gonna watch this, I understand that.  But he could actually do the right thing.  And that would be good for obvious reasons, it would save lives.  But also it would protect his reputation, it would stop history from blaming him.  Or if you didn't do the bad thing, history wouldn't be able to blame you.  You wouldn't be getting bad reviews if you were doing a good job.  And I wish that we could like turn that vain obsession that he has with himself in a positive direction.  That could be used to cause him to just be driven all day to make sure that we're nailing this thing, that we're doing all that we can.  And maybe it's not too late to go in that direction.  We've hit 55,000 deaths, let's not hit 100,000, how about that?  How about?  let's get him to take it seriously and maybe if he spends a little bit less time chasing cameras and a little bit more time talking to his experts and following their advice, he can succeed both substantively and in terms of the optics.

Fool, you're talking about the most insecure, not just president, but probably person that any of us have ever encountered in our lives.  His insecurity is plastered everywhere.

And then I read a phony story in the failing New York Times.  Always failing.  It's taking years to fail, though.  about my work, schedule, and eating habits, written by a third-rate reporter who knows nothing about me.  I will often be in the Oval Office late into the night and read and see that I am angrily eating a hamburger and Diet Coke in my bedroom.  People with me are always stunned.  Anything to demean.  Imagine if Obama had tweeted about the allegation that he was eating a hamburger.  By the way, that's the second version of the tweet.  The first had to be replaced because he once again spelled hamburger wrong.  And anyway, and it's not the reporter that's saying it.  It's the source.  It's like, check the people around you if you don't want them to know that.  And it's also filled with lies.  I haven't left the White House in many months.  Yeah, except for the many golfing trips and the many rallies you did literally in public.  They were televised.  The trip to India you took just a couple of months ago.  Yeah.  And many trips to Mar-a-Lago where you ran events that were very public.  All of these things, just constant lies.  And he's lashing out because he's mad.  Some people, when they're criticized in this way, will then overcompensate to try to ward off future criticism.  Please go in that direction.  Actually work.  Yeah.

And Brad Pitt seems to like Fauci, and so he wants to play him and give him compliments or whatever.
