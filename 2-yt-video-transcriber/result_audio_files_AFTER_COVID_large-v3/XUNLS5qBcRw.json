            "text": "Seven days to economic collapse.  Let's have a look.  Hello everyone, Florian Heiser here and welcome to another episode of Heiser Says.  Grab your stein of coffee and let's have a look at this article from news.com.au written by Tarek Brooker discussing the job seeker, job keeper changes on September the 28th and how they may cause an economic collapse.  The countdown is on to the day the rug will be pulled from under us.  This is when Aussies will feel the real economic pain of the pandemic.  And... He's right.  Australia's in recession, everyone.  We're in recession.  For the first time in 28 years.  But we haven't really felt the true impact of it.  I know some people have, but the wider economy really haven't.  There's a lot of government intervention in the recession that Australia had to have.  You know what I'm going to bring up?  I'm going to bring up trading economics.  And let's just have a look at our indicators here.  Let's just have a look at Australia.  This is a great website to be familiar with.  And you can see here GDP growth fell 7%.  Let's pull out the max chart.  See this little trend down, the bouncing up and down?  That's around the time Australia, or there, that fall.  That was the last recession.  That was the recession Australia had to have.  Remember that?  I was a child then, but I remember it.  Now, look at what we've had here.  Look at what we've had here.  These two things aren't the same.  What we're going through now is different.  And all the government interventions into the economy has stopped us from feeling this impact.  But it's going to manifest, everyone.  And we'll have to see what happens in seven days.  In the dark days of late March, the situation was dire for many Australians.  Lions were out the door and around the block at Centrelink offices across the nation, and there were predictions that as many as 3.4 million Australians faced the prospect of becoming unemployed in the coming months.  As a result of the severity of the challenges facing the economy, the Morrison government instituted an unparalleled level of support for households and businesses.  The JobKeeper program was introduced providing $750 per employee per week to any business that could prove a large reduction in overall turnover with different criteria for small and large businesses to qualify.  You could argue that due to the government-imposed restrictions on the economy, this is them paying, or at least paying to offset their liability because essentially they're destroying businesses.  They are literally destroying businesses.  In some ways, this feels like the middle class are going to really cop the brunt of it.  According to Treasury estimates, in the following months, over 900,000 businesses and more than 3.5 million workers were supported on the JobKeeper program.  The JobSeeker coronavirus supplement was also introduced, effectively doubling or more fortnightly unemployment payments for recipients.  At the cost of $70 billion over six months, the JobKeeper program has provided over $2.6 billion in wage subsidies each week to qualifying businesses.  In fact, JobKeeper ended up providing so much extra cash to businesses that company profits for the June quarter jumped 15%.  This occurred despite the fact that the June quarter was the height of the various lockdowns and restrictions across the nation.  Well, here's the thing.  If your competitor is getting the JobKeeper money, you're at a competitive disadvantage for not taking it.  So I can understand why people and businesses jumped on it.  But in the coming weeks, this enormous level of government assistance will begin to come to an end.  In eight days, the scaffold of support for businesses provided by JobKeeper will start to gradually be removed.  It will mean hundreds of thousands of businesses are forced to stand on their own two feet for the first time in six months, and approximately 1.3 million workers will lose access to support from the JobKeeper program.  So here we have what's happening.  This is JobKeeper payments now.  Now it's $1,500 a fortnight to eligible Australians, 3.5 million workers in 960,000 businesses.  As of July, the government budget for the scheme is $100 billion plus.  From September in seven days, a two-tier payment begins based on pre-COVID hours.  $1,200 a fortnight for workers on 20 hours or more.  $750 a fortnight for workers on less than 20 hours.  I mean, this is... This reduction of $750 for people who were in a casual job or people who weren't working a lot of hours.  I mean it's ludicrous that some people were better off.  Better off financially on this JobKeeper payment than not.  Because, well, that creates a... That makes them say, why am I working so hard?  Why am I doing this?  So this is a good lifestyle.  I could get used to this.  How many people are going to struggle to get back into the work mentality?  There's another thing that's never been brought up anyway.  You know, months of pretty much just chilling... Hopefully people are, well, we're starting to see, we're starting to see in the unemployment figures, but that's not JobKeeper, that's JobSeeker, where people are starting their own businesses.  Or going in job on the, what is it, gig economy.  So from January 4, the top tier payment will reduce to $1,000.  Second tier will reduce to $650.  And that's still more than they're getting on the doll, guys.  And how many of these JobKeeper people are are doing zero hours.  That's the thing.  There are some businesses where job keepers, job keeper recipients are doing zero hours.  So job seeker.  In seven days, the $550 coronavirus supplement will be reduced to $250.  So it's $300 less a fortnight.  Payments to continue at least until the end of the year.  And they're able to earn up to $300 a fortnight.  So you can get your cop in a head of $300, but you can earn up to $300 a fortnight.  But that's kind of difficult.  Mutual obligation requirements increase and must look for up to eight jobs a month.  Must accept any offer of suitable work.  Any offer of suitable work.  And I think most people... I know that there's... And I've read some of these articles where they talk about people who won't take a job or won't do this... I think they're, I hope, maybe naively, I hope they're the fringe cases of people that won't take a job.  I think most people don't want to be on JobSeeker.  They want to be in a job.  Or let me know what you think in the comments, guys.  The problem is, when the difference between JobSeeker and the difference between working isn't that much, because people aren't dumb, they can figure out, oh, wait a minute, if I go and work on.  If I go and work a job and I'm doing 30, 40 hours a week, oh, and I only walk away with a couple of hundred extra, you calculate that at your hourly, at your hours worked.  That's the problem.  That's where you get in a poverty trap.  That's where the support systems can create a poverty trap.  And the problem is, you know, the reduction in opportunities for people to drag themselves out of a poverty trap can then manifest in intergenerational poverty.  And then you've got a whole generation of people.  Some of them haven't even seen a role model ever work.  There's communities here in Australia like that.  It's all over the world.  Remember, everyone, the road to hell is paved with good intentions.  So according to a survey of businesses performed by research firm Digital Finance Analytics, well, technically they're a boutique research firm.  I like that term, probably because I hear it so much in architecture.  Small and medium business owners are quite guarded about their prospects going forward, with around one in four of those surveys stating that given circumstances, they did not expect to be trading in six months' time.  So 25% of businesses may be gone, small and medium businesses.  SMEs are facing challenging conditions across the country, but some states are suffering more than others, said DFA Principal Martin North.  The ACT is performing quite well.  Yeah, I don't think anyone's surprised.  the ACT is performing well.  I mean, this is the thing, you've got to get in the government work.  Yesterday I did a live stream where we looked through, of most things, the statement of compatibility of changes to legislation in Victoria and how they, frankly, get around their human rights charter.  And afterwards I went and talked to a colleague and she was praising our Premier here with the restrictions for keeping her safe, for protecting us all.  And that kind of disheartened me a bit.  Because I think there are some people, particularly civil servants, and she's a civil servant, who may not have felt the impact of this on their day-to-day.  Sure, there may be some restrictions and some inconveniences, particularly here in Queensland.  But that doesn't mean your job's still fine, you're still getting paid.  Oh, you may need to go through a few extra procedures at work.  That's fine.  Oh, look, I got this money from the government.  Oh, look, I can access my super.  It's good times.  That's the concern.  So the ACT is performing quite well due to support provided by the public sector in Canberra.  But businesses in Victoria and particularly Melbourne are suffering badly as a result of the second round of lockdown.  In Victoria, almost 35% of businesses surveyed stated they did not expect to be trading in six months' time compared to the national average of 25%.  So our 25 is looking better by comparison.  This 25 is still atrocious, everyone.  25% of businesses surveyed don't think they'll be in business in six months.  In Victoria, it's 35%, nearly over a third of all businesses.  I mean, there you go.  Look at that.  Queensland.  What's that?  20%.  WA between 20 and 25.  SA.  20%.  Tasmania.  Look at that.  Look at Tassie.  30% of businesses.  What's going on in Tassie?  Well, you know what it is.  Tourism's gone.  Tourism's gone.  Who's traveling?  The challenges faced by businesses vary widely between different industries.  In the transport and warehousing sector, businesses are faring relatively well, with less than 10% saying they did not expect to be in business in six months.  In other industries, however, things are far more severe, with well over half of businesses in arts and recreation saying they don't expect to be around in six months' time.  Half of businesses in education and training and accommodation and food services also predicted a grim future.  And you can see here, look at that.  A recent analysis of employment by consulting firm Taylor Fry suggests that the concern is very much warranted.  I mean, this is a scary prospect, everyone.  What this tells me, looking at this, what this says is I bet you some businesses are just riding it out, riding on fumes, getting the job keeper to help out their team.  Can you see that happening for a small business?  That's a business where you actually have a relationship with your staff.  Whereas a business owner, you'd make those sacrifices to help them out because you like them.  I know this is a shocking concept for people that have worked in huge firms and have only ever dealt with HR people.  You've probably never been in a situation like that where you have a personal relationship with the owner of the business.  Maybe that's just my experience.  Maybe I like the stuff that I kept.  The ones we didn't keep.  If you don't like them, you just get rid of them quick.  Well, that's not as easy as it should be in Australia, to be honest.  Their analysis showed that Aussie small business, those employing fewer than 20 staff, had lost 8% of jobs, with medium businesses employing 20 to 200 staff had lost 7.2% of jobs since the beginning of the pandemic.  Victorian businesses doing it particularly tough, with the data from DFA, Taylor Fry's analysis, showed that smaller medium businesses in the state recorded a huge 12.6% drop in employment.  With the DFA survey covering various demographics from local to industry, North shared that he was particularly concerned for the future of Melbourne's CBD, stating it may become something of a wasteland with so many businesses at risk closing their doors for good.  I think Martin's right.  I think it's going to.  I mean, who would go, who right now in their mind, who at all would jump in and buy like a failing business in Melbourne?  If there's a coffee shop that you know that's failing, would you take a loan to go and buy it now, even if it's under distress?  Maybe if you expected it to turn back around soon.  But what if there's a third lockdown?  What if there's a third restriction?  How much money do you need to have to cash flow it until you can start turning a profit?  According to North, the key turning point for Victorian businesses was the re-implementation of the second lockdown.  And we're looking at, the thing is this, we've looked at these extensions of powers in Victoria.  They've been pushed out until April 2021, everyone.  So what else could be pushed out until April 2021?  Up until the lockdown was... Oh, and I should say, the bill hasn't passed the upper house, although I suspect it will sail through.  There's still opportunity for Victorians to reach out to their representatives.  Reach out to the members in the upper house.  You've got that.  You've got that safeguard.  Labor got rid of that here in Queensland 100 years ago.  You know, we can't have... And no politician is ever going to reintroduce it because they don't want other people checking their work.  Up until the lockdown was reintroduced in Victoria, things were looking pretty similar across the various states and territories.  But since then, businesses have been decimated by a second round of forced closures due to the virus at North.  The issues in Melbourne have become more systematic, with many businesses and key supply chains at risk.  Given small and medium businesses employing approximately 68.3% of workers, the potential closure of so many businesses could be a devastating blow to an already struggling economy.  When asked how many businesses would end up closing their doors for good, North replied... With all the variables, it's hard to predict exactly how things are going to play out.  But business owners are generally reasonably realistic about their prospects and have a fairly accurate sense of where their business is at.  So let's read between the lines there.  Those that are saying the 35% that are saying they won't be here in six months' time may not be.  In the next nine months, that 35%, they could just be preparing to exit.  Because that's what you do.  It takes time to get out of a business.  Maybe they're formulating a strategy to get out.  In the next nine months, businesses face a challenging transition to the long-term COVID normal.  I hate that term.  COVID normal.  No.  Normal.  Okay?  You don't want this to be part of our lexicon.  No.  Return to normal.  as the various support mechanisms are reduced and finally removed.  As the insolvency moratorium, JobKeeper and JobSeeker supplement are stripped away, the true state of the economy and business balance sheets is finally revealed.  Yeah, that's the thing.  The trading while insolvent, I mean, that's just... As a small business owner, that just worries me.  I feel sorry for all the builders and tradies that are doing business right now with insolvent businesses and won't get paid.  Because they're going to be some.  I bet you.  What kind of damage will we find when the economic bandages are finally pulled off remains to be seen and is a matter of great debate among analysts and economists.  But if the views of businesses from DFA's survey prove to be accurately representative of the broader business community, the situation for the economy may be more dire than the current consensus suggests.  What do you think about that everyone?  It wouldn't be the first time that the consensus is wrong, would it?  How do you think the economy will handle the pulling back of all of these interventions?  Let me know your thoughts and opinions in the comments below.  Do you think North is on the money?  Do you think we have a right to be concerned?  And do you think we'll start to see economic impacts on the 28th?  Or will it drag out a little bit longer?  As always, thanks for watching.  Let me know your thoughts and opinions down below.
