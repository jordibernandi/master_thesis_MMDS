            "text": "There are, like I mentioned, several different credit scoring models.  However, all of them, for the most part, focus on two really key factors.  The first one being on time payments, because if you think about it from a lender's perspective, what is the biggest indicator that you're going to pay on time in the future?  Well, have you paid on time in the past?  The second is this mouthy word called credit utilization.  which sounds heavy, but it's actually a pretty simple concept.  Utilization is the amount of available credit that you use.  So let's think about it like this.  Carlos, you have a credit card that has $1,000 line of credit on it.  If you spend $300 this month, at the end of the month, you are 30% utilized, $300 of that $1,000 line of credit.  Now, here's what's really important.  When it comes to credit utilization, you want to keep it nice and low.  You want to keep it at 30% or less. ",

            "end_time": "00:03:58,420",
            "text": "So the first thing you can do is make sure you're making all of your payments on time.  Missing a payment is one of the single biggest ways to crush your credit score.  So keep tabs of all of the bills that you owe, not only to your lender.  So think about making your credit card payments, your loan payments, so a mortgage, auto loan, student loan.  But the other thing you need to consider is protecting what could go to collections.  So let's say you went to the doctors and you didn't realize you got a bill from the doctor and that gets sent to collections.  That's going to impact your score.  So it is really important that we're kind of playing defense in these ways. ",
