            "text": "A lot of times people have differences simply because they're not able to put themselves in somebody else's shoes.  You don't know how somebody else lives.  You don't know where they came from.  You don't know their journey.  And you'll never know that if you're just stuck in your little box.  You know, I grew up in New York City and a lot of people in New York are the type of people that will never leave New York.  They will grow up there.  They will work there.  They will die there.  And they will not know anything outside of that city.  And they will tell you it's the greatest city on earth.  And I believe that, but I also believe you got to branch out and figure out what else is going on and how other people are living and how that's different from you.  And, you know, just traveling in all these different places, talking to different people and the things that make them who they are.  They've given me little bits and pieces, little wisdom and knowledge to guide me along and make me a more Full person, you know, because I'm just a collection of my own experiences.  And the more people I meet and the more places I go and the things that I see and the things that I learn, it just makes me more well-rounded and more able to reach more people. ",
