            "text": "So alongside an unelected EU commission that have comprehensively failed and are increasingly shambolic, at the top of the EU you've also got French President Emmanuel Macron with some really bizarre, irresponsible comments.  that people have picked up, Ben Cobley, I think, summing it up.  What a strange, rambling interview.  this is from Macron.  He repeats fake news, makes bizarre accusations, contradicts himself, laughs about playing the bad guy, and falls back on Brexit lies.  He appears obsessed.  Now, let's start off with the Politico report.  Macron trying to reduce demand by criticising Oxford AstraZeneca jab, says vaccine scientist.  One of the scientists behind the drug has accused the French President Emmanuel Macron of trying to suppress demand.  This is very, very serious stuff.  On Friday, Macron said the vaccine was quasi ineffective on people older than 65.  Some say those 60 years or older.  John Bell, a medical professor at Oxford University, told the BBC on Saturday.  I'm not sure where he got that from.  Going on to say, I suspect this is a bit of demand management for Mr Macron.  If you didn't have any vaccine, the best thing you could do is reduce demand.  As Andrew Neil notes, in a country already awash with anti-vaxxers, President Macron's questioning in a fit of pique in the effectiveness of the AstraZeneca vaccine on no scientific basis whatsoever plumbs the depths of irresponsibility.  And again, like the EU commissioner who suggested the UK was trying to start or questioned whether the UK was trying to start a vaccine war.  This isn't just some nutty backbench MEP.  This is the French president.  making these comments.  In this interview with the Guardian and a small group of other media, he also made a number of other comments.  Macron saying, whenever there's a problem with the EU, the British just love to detest the French and me and say we are responsible.  I've accepted this role, Macron says.  Sometimes when there are tensions, I ask, why me?  It is perhaps making me out to be more important than I am.  Of course, Macron has to get the dig in on Brexit saying he thinks Brexit is an error.  Saying that I respect the sovereignty of the people and the people voted so it had to be done.  But I think that the vote was based on a lot of lies, apparently.  Macron going on to say, well, now we see it has made things much more difficult in many ways.  Well, I think we can compare the performance of the British government on vaccines with the EU and judge for ourselves.  So there you go, Macron having another dig at Brexit and making some ridiculous claims.  A French president who certainly in this interview seems to have lost the plot.  Let me know what you make of these comments from French President Emmanuel Macron.
