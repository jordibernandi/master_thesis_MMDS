Because we are dealing here with what Hegel calls concrete universality.  In every concrete historical situation, a certain universality.  Today you have a lot of violence in the United States, but you figure.  You know, it's the same paradox, maybe I exaggerate a little bit, as if to research racism in Germany in the 1930s and ignore anti-Semitism.  No, if you talked about racism, then you had to mention it.  But nonetheless, now I come to my final point, maybe problematic to you, but it's crucial.  My reference here will be, and I say this to provoke you, I think love identity politics, a particular identity.  White liberals love Native Americans who dance their folkloric dances, who have some shitty deep insight into how we shouldn't objectivize nature.  You know, before you mine a mountain, you should ask the spirit of the mountain and do it if you are allowed all that stuff.  They love it.  What they don't like is if those underprivileged don't just play the game.  we want to assert our particular identity, but no, sorry guys, we are oppressed in a much more radical way.  We want to oppose you at the level of a different universality.  The only truth Now I slowly am coming to an end.  Just one quote, surprising for you, and then one wonderful Jewish joke.  With this I will finish.  First the quote, it will maybe surprise you.  Who is it from?  You should be remembered today.  Huey Newton, the founder and theorist of the Black Panther Party.  He so clearly saw half a century ago the limitation of local national resistance to the global reign of capital.  He even made a key step further and rejected the term decolonization as inappropriate.  His point was that one cannot fight global capitalism from the position of national unity.  Here is his statement from a unique dialogue.  This was a beautiful sublime moment.  In 1972, Huey Newton had a dialogue with Eric Erikson, the Freudian psychoanalyst, who was deeply sympathetic.  White guy, old white guy from Europe, but deeply sympathetic.  We in the Black Panther Party saw that the United States was no longer a nation.  It was something else.  It was more than a nation.  It had not only expanded its territorial boundaries, but it had expanded all of its control as well.  We called it an empire.  Now, at one time, the world had an empire in which the conditions of rule were different, the Roman Empire.  to exist external to and independent of the Roman Empire, because their means of exploitation, conquest and control was all relatively limited.  But when we say empire today, we mean precisely what we say.  An empire is an controlling all the world's lands and people.  We believe that there are no more colonies or neo-colonies.  If a people is colonized, it must be possible for them to decolonize and become what they formerly were.  But what happens when the raw materials are extracted and labor is exploited within a territory dispersed over the entire globe?  When the riches of the whole Then, the people and the economy are so integrated into the imperialist presupposes that identities exist.  I don't think they exist.  And that's my problem even with, for example, certain versions of LGBT to make a jump.  I'm approaching the end.  Of LGBT+.  My perception is again and again that they still accept the fact that boots, bisexual, multisexual, asexual, whatever you want.  But the way, to repeat my old joke, maybe some of you know it, the way I would approach Maybe there are some identities that we didn't yet discover, so we should keep a mind open.  What if tomorrow a guy comes who said I am a tri-gender butch or whatever, oh sorry guy, you were not in the list, we will add you to the list.  But if there is a lesson, if the today subject subjectivity.  The plus itself, the psychoanalytic name for it is hysteria, feminine hysteria, which we should not read it in a male chauvinist way as hysterical women.  For Jacques Lacan, this is the highest mode of subjectivity.  Lacan emphasizes that all creative science, not university science where you just report on the results, but creative science is hysterical.  But if you are heterosexual and love a woman and the woman asks you this eternal stupid question, it can be annoying, tell me why do you love me?  Of course there is no answer to this one.  The moment you answer it, You are not truly in love.  But you know, this is the basic hysterical question.  You, the discourse of the master, society, you are telling me what I am.  A wife, a servant, whatever.  Why am I what you are saying that I am?  This basic doubt of your identity, which precisely opens up a universal dimension. ",
