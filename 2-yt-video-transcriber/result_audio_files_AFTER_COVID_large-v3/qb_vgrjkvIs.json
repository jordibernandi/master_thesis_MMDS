            "text": "AT&T owns Warner Media, all right?  And they're the company that runs HBO and CNN.  So they also own Ellen.  Ellen DeGeneres, the liberal icon, the liberal gay icon.  Extremely talented woman, by the way.  Very funny, very quick, very sharp.  The most successful daytime talk show host right now.  16 years on the air.  Well, she's getting investigated.  by warner media and at t for running a program with a quote toxic environment.  now i went over this before.  i don't know her very much is on a program once i get along with her.  it was a good appearance.  she was fair to me.  i don't know.  the ellen show is run by hooligans i don't know.  okay but i'll tell you no one's safe.  no one is.  if ellen degeneres can get investigated No one is safe.  And do I trust Warner Media and AT&T to tell the truth?  In this case, I do.  They're not going to cancel Ellen.  Ellen makes too much money.  They'll investigate, and then they'll go, well, we have some recommendations to improve the Ellen show behind the scenes.  And that gives them cover for the next time.  Because they'll go, oh, we're not just investigating conservatives.  We investigated Ellen.  That's what this is all about. ",
