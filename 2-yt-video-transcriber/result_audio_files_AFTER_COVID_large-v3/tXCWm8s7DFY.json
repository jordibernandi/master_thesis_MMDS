            "text": "Do you remember when Europe was actually united?  Yeah, for a short period of time after the 40s and 50s when countries became democracies and they were just trading with each other.  And then they decided to go with this project to at some point turn the whole continent into a United States of Europe.  Now, the division started there.  Brexit is happening.  And now we have reports, thanks to Martina Bett from the Express, talking about how it's getting so bad that Angela Merkel and even her former deputy have been talking about how warning the rest of Europe and the EU establishment that this project could collapse the way things are going.  So the headline is talking about how Germany warned the EU bloc that is in danger of complete collapse.  The former deputy of Merkel gave this warning that a badly handled Brexit would have sent Europe down the drain.  So this is obviously post-2016 when the negotiations started and they were quite worried about the consequences for the rest of Europe, all the other member states, but also economically for Europe.  So obviously Merkel's former deputy Gabrielle claimed that if the UK got everything it wanted other countries would have left the EU and the Union would have been in deep trouble.  So that's partly true and that's also one of the reasons that since 2016 The European Union turned the negotiations into a complete disaster, a very difficult task to do, mission impossible.  Only just to show, partly to punish the UK, saying, told you it's a bad idea, it's not easy, is it?  And partly to scare the other member states to tell them, you know, if you vote to leave, if you want to leave, you have to face the same obstacles as the UK.  I don't think that's the case anymore because people have seen the reality since we stopped being a member officially.  He said that if we organize Brexit in the wrong way, then we'll all be in deep trouble.  So that's that opinion.  And you have, obviously, Angela Merkel.  who is quite passionate about this European project.  But people always make this simple mistake.  People think that it's actually Merkel and the German politicians who always wanted the United States of Europe.  In reality, it's always been a French dream and a vision that comes from, right now, Emmanuel Macron.  What Germany wants to do, ideally, at any point, is they want to be in charge.  Because German politicians have always been control freaks.  So as long as they have a say and they become the puppet masters, that's all they care about.  Whereas Macron truly wants this United States to Europe as a concept.  And this is why his dream of this fake United Country.  is said to be crushed as Angela Merkel is reluctant to pay.  Again, this is Di Santolo who's reporting that Macron's plan to have this federalised European Union is said to be dashed by Angela Merkel as she would be reluctant to end her political career paying for this expensive project.  Don't forget, the Germans, at the end of the day, are still in favour of efficiency, especially when it comes to the financial side of politics.  So Macron doesn't care.  He doesn't even actually have any set of values or ideology.  He claims to be a centrist but he's just basically a federalist who wants everything to be centralized.  So there's a bit of a clash here and this is the whole point of people not realizing that France and Germany have never actually been united in that sense.  They always pretend to be in order to run the whole continent and tell other member states what to do.  But things could change the way things are going because with the Brexit negotiations, they're very, very angry at Boris Johnson and David Frost, the chief negotiator for the UK.  This report in the Express is talking about how There is obviously little progress that's been made during the Brexit trade talks and Boris' strategy has caused anger in Europe as the media hit out at the saboteur Prime Minister.  And what they've done, I've noticed this over the last few days, very smart, they always do this, the pro-EU press and hacks Every now and then.  they did the same thing during the Theresa May's reign where they tried to divide the Brexit side by sending out misinformation and leaks.  So a few days ago it came out to say that Boris Johnson says he wants to get 60% of Brexit done.  I'm like, it was the most frustrating thing to see because a lot of people obviously fell for it because they just assumed that negotiations are black and white.  As someone who I've spent five years negotiating deals in the private sector, what's actually happening is that obviously the red lines are still there for both sides.  But in terms of the demands, the UK decided to say, we're going to compromise.  You know, up to 40% of compromise overall, nothing to do with the actual red lines of demands.  This is just obviously negotiating tactics and strategy.  At this point, nothing has changed in terms of the way the Brexit demands are going for the UK side.  The way as it stands, it's still going to be either a normal free trade, obviously it won't be as comprehensive, or WTO.  I don't care.  Either way, I'm fine with those options.  Now, Michel Barnier has now warned Boris Johnson that he cannot secure access to European markets without allowing EU vessels into UK waters.  This is the sort of language I don't like.  And the media have always been using it.  They haven't criticised the EU.  Why is it that we want access to their markets?  Obviously, they want access to our markets too.  This is a two-way system.  I don't understand every single time when people say, will the EU give the UK a trade deal?  No, it's... both sides agreeing to sign a trade deal or not.  It's not one side giving it to the other.  It makes absolutely no sense.  Now, a government source has said this week that the particular way the EU insisted on parallelism led to paralysis.  I mean, the whole thing is... They needed to have these discussions.  And the way it's been continuing from the Michel Barnier side, they're just making things even more difficult because he can't manage the member states.  Every time he goes to France to talk to Macron, they just send him back when it comes to fisheries.  And this is the biggest problem.  So the European newspapers and commentators are now talking about this kind of outrageous tactic of an out-of-control Downing Street after a string of leaks sought to blame France, Ireland and Germany for the Brexit breakdown at the time.  I mean, who else are you going to be blaming?  It's literally France, Ireland and Germany.  Ireland not necessarily because Ireland have been used by the EU like a bunch of puppets and I actually feel sorry for the Irish citizens when they have these incompetent governments who are basically selling out their country to these European federalists.  but definitely France and Germany have been problematic.  the Netherlands to an extent.  We didn't do anything wrong.  We just want to leave.  Let us go.  Now, everything is at fisheries.  It's not really about level playing field.  That's just an excuse.  They're talking about how Macron is putting his foot down.  He won't accept.  We won't accept anything as long as they don't have access to UK waters.  It's all about fisheries.  Not as an excuse because fisheries is just one part.  They're using that to essentially keep us as a non-member member.  That's just one way of doing it.  So completing a trade deal before the end of transition period is in the interest of both sides.  This is according to the European Minister in France.  essentially says let's not kid ourselves.  if there is no deal.  it will be a difficult issue.  They don't know how to play poker, do they?  Even Theresa May wasn't this bad.  At least she was saying, in terms of rhetoric, no deal is better than bad deal.  They already admit that they are desperate to have a deal.  They already admit that no deal is bad.  And then they try to be strong and say, oh yeah, but we're going to be difficult with you.  But if we know that you're desperate, then we're going to use that against you.  I think this is why David Frost and Boris Johnson's team, they know this now.  They've been studying what happened under Theresa May and this is why they're using it against them.  I mean, speaking of Theresa May's government, we just found out that Philip Hammond, that's not really a surprising news, but it's recently come out that he was actually plotting with Michel Barnier to keep the UK in the Customs Union during the negotiations.  You kind of knew that, but he wasn't your typical Ramona because he was part of the government, he was the Chancellor and his job wasn't to sabotage in a direct way, but he did.  So that's that guy.  And then good news is that the UK is becoming even more independent.  Do you remember when the Remainers were telling us that becoming an independent country is difficult because you can't easily sign trade deals with other countries?  It takes decades.  Yeah, if you're the European Union, it takes decades, not with normal countries.  So the UK and Japan are now getting very close to signing their first trade deal after decades.  So the UK will have its own trade deal with Japan, but also there are other countries.  This is actually the beauty of the way these negotiations are going.  And now this is going to force Boris Johnson to not give in and to actually either go out on W2 terms or have a trade deal that allows us to continue to trade with Japan and also New Zealand because that's another friend and ally that we are close to signing a deal with.  So when you have countries like Japan, New Zealand, and obviously now Australia and Canada is coming soon, South Korea as well, We are essentially guaranteeing these trade deals.  We have to make sure that whatever happens at the end of December, that it doesn't stop us from actually officially signing these deals.  This is why all this pressure is going to actually create a good opportunity for Boris Johnson to go to the EU and say, well, we have all these trade deals ready.  So unfortunately, we're either going to go out on WTO terms or you're going to have to give us a trade deal that's based on clean Brexit.  And it's all about clean Brexit, essentially, at the end of the day, because one of the EU lobbyists, one of the head of think tanks, Charles Grant, is talking about how the Brexit deal is still possible.  Now, this is coming from a guy who is running the Centre for European Reform.  They are essentially Europhiles.  They are pro-EU, although they are trying to be critical every now and then.  So they say we're not really living in a fantasy land.  But his opinion doesn't really matter in that sense because I get what he says, that yes, of course, it's still possible to have a trade deal, obviously.  But not randomly, not just because both sides need it.  WTO Brexit is still Brexit and it's still trade.  So some people say that, you know, if you leave on WTO terms, you're not actually trading with the EU.  no business trades with business not government and this is the thing that people have to know.  and one of the former Australian ambassadors has now kicked off looking at how the EU handled Brexit, criticising the EU, saying that at this point clean Brexit is needed more than ever and I think he's absolutely right because he says one of the really crucial problems was immigration.  I was in Brussels when the whole process that led to the referendum took place in 2016.  If the EU partners had only been a little bit more flexible towards the UK, the referendum could actually have turned out quite differently.  So this guy obviously represented Australia, both on the EU level and NATO, and has said that the UK will continue to hold its own interests around the world.  He's right.  And actually, to be fair, if they had played it slightly differently, the Remain could have won that referendum.  Because at the end of the day, it was still 52-48, it wasn't a landslide.  And I always say we actually lost more Eurosceptic votes to the Remain side than Remainers coming to the Brexit side.  So technically, we should have won that referendum with a bigger margin.  But at the end of the day, at this point, he's right.  If they had been slightly more flexible, especially on immigration, The Remain could have won, but they haven't.  Thank God for that.  And this is where we are.  And they're all divided.  We're going to be united.  We have our own problems in this country.  Boris Johnson's government is not perfect.  They're becoming a bit socialist-y when it comes to economics.  Definitely Keynesian.  It's not really my thing.  But this is what people voted for.  apparently so this is what we have for now.  if you enjoy the content subscribe to the channel and support the channel.  go on the link in the description or just go on youtube.com slash myotc slash join.  if you want to see this channel going strongly every day then support the channel.  i'm always here i'm myotc.  i'll see you guys in the next video.
