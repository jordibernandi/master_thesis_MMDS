            "text": "Good damn afternoon, Americans.  Jericho Green here with you once again.  And happy Fourth of July.  Happy birthday, America.  It's been a beautiful day.  Not only is the sun shining, we have some of our good friends in town.  They brought the kids.  We went to the beach this morning.  Had a little seafood by the sea.  It was wonderful.  My wife ordered little Jericho green t-shirts like this one for all the kids.  It's a beautiful thing in a beautiful country.  Happy 4th of July.  I hope you guys are able to put flesh to flame today.  I got my coals heating up right now, burgers and dogs for the kids.  We got some ribs, we got some steak, we got some chicken.  It's gonna be beautiful.  Later on, s'mores, of course, and fireworks.  Now to the rest of the country, Outside of California, you guys have real fireworks.  They go up in the air.  They make a loud boom.  There's lots of colors and lights.  It's wonderful.  But while the rest of the country is setting off real shit, California shows up to the party like, hey, guys, I got sparklers.  That's us.  So if you got the real shit, enjoy it.  It could be worse.  You could be here lighting smoke bombs.  They say we're not supposed to have fireworks that go up and go bang, but tell that to all the fucking assholes who've been lighting them off since June 1st.  I hate when people set off fireworks before and after the 4th of July.  I think it's disrespectful.  I think you're fucking dicks.  I don't really care what anybody else thinks.  That's how I feel about it.  It's for the 4th, on the 4th, before or after.  that is a no-no.  Now, to everybody in the borders, within the borders of America, and even people abroad.  If you don't like America, you don't like our brash attitude.  You don't like the man we have in charge.  You don't like our excess.  You think we push the rest of the world around and we get involved in everything.  And you just don't like America.  I say, fuck you.  alright this is the greatest country on earth with an F. now I don't know what they got going on Mars Saturn all that other shit.  but on this planet this is the greatest country period.  the shit ain't even close not even close.  do we have corruption running rampant through our fucking government?  yes Do we have some things we need to fix?  Yes.  But despite all that, this is the best thing going.  And until people stop risking their lives to come here by the millions, I don't want to hear that shit.  This is the best.  I am glad, happy, and feel fortunate to have been born here.  I feel fortunate to have been born in 1980 and missed all the bullshit, all the real shit that people went through to make it.  so I can sit here and say what I'm saying.  All the people protesting, talking shit who don't like America.  Notice the fact that you don't have a burlap sack over your fucking head being drowned somewhere because other countries don't play that.  talking about the government shit.  You're welcome.  To all the people who served and or died doing it, thank you.  I appreciate it.  To all the people inside the borders of America, you don't like it?  Get the fuck out.  Me along with a bunch of other people who feel the same way will be standing on the shore going, bye.  As that ship sails to wherever the fuck.  Nobody cares.  If you don't like it, get the fuck out.  Go up to Canada, eh?  I don't give a shit where you go.  Bounce.  But you won't.  Fuck no, you won't.  All you celebrities, if Trump gets elected, I'm going, you ain't going no fucking where.  Because even your dumb ass knows how good we have it here.  Now, again, to all you America haters... You can suck our red, white, and blue dick.  Here's the bad news.  The blue part's at the bottom.  So you gotta get all your skills to reach the blue.  Don't worry.  We have faith.  You will get to the blue.  People, I got to go in here.  I got kings for getting hot so I can put flesh to flame.  You do the same.  Cook some meat, enjoy your people, and blow some shit up at the end of the night.  That's how we do it.  This is murica.  But you know how it goes.
