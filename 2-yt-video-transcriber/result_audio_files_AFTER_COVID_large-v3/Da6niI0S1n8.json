One, they either haven't studied it carefully and they're not sure how to teach it.  Or they don't really believe it.  Or they don't want to be associated with the prophecy nuts.

But you don't say, well, you know, there's nuts out there that are preaching heresy.  I'm not going to preach the gospel because I don't want to be associated with that.  No, we say, I don't want to say double down because that sounds very Las Vegas-y and that's not exactly Christian.  But we rededicate.  We redouble our efforts to preach clearly and accurately because there are nuts.  So we've got to rediscover the purpose.  and the power of Bible prophecy, and that's part of what I do. ",

I mean, well, they have supported and supplied and armed all of Israel's worst neighbors.  And as you know, because you know me well, I'm a dual U.S.-Israeli citizen.  We live in Israel.  We live in Jerusalem.  Of our four sons, two have been in the Israeli army.  One just finished, and one's still in special forces.  So we're all in, and our enemies have been armed and funded by Russia.  So that is aggressive.  But of late, of the last several decades, Russia hasn't been directly attacking us.  But they continue to arm and supply our worst enemies.  So that's really what you're talking about.  In Syria, we're watching Russia and Iran and now Turkey in the last week move very aggressively.  This is just a few miles above our northern mountains, our northern borders.  What's intriguing about it, I mean, it's unnerving geopolitically.  And I'm concerned that our president, who we need to continue to pray for, and has done a lot of wonderful things, but I think I disagree with his decision essentially to give the green light to Turkey to start moving into Syria.  This is not helpful.  But prophetically it's interesting because in Ezekiel 38 and 39, what Bible scholars call the coming war of Gog and Magog, an end times prophecy, Russia, known as Magog in the Bible, Persia, I mean Iran, known as Persia in the Bible, and Turkey, which historically was known in ancient times as Gomer.

Now, we haven't seen this happen in 2,500 years.  So, of course, skeptics say, well, you know, it's just hocus pocus.  It's just fantasy.  It's just myth.  It's never going to happen.  But Ezekiel 36 and 37, the chapters, of course, that precede these chapters, these have largely come true.  These are the most famous prophecies about the rebirth of Israel.

I believe, as you do, that every person in the world needs a friend who loves Jesus.  Regardless of what they have done, who they are, any background.  So God is opening those doors.  Now, that's not their felt need.  They're not saying, oh, I want Joel to come and tell me about Jesus.

And they want to build, they want to convince us.  I don't mind them wanting to convince us because they're opening for the first time in hundreds and hundreds of years or ever, and a willingness to have a dialogue with serious followers of Jesus.  This has been an extraordinary set of opportunities.  And they have put this on the front page of all of their newspapers, all of their television networks.  And we have real opportunity to talk to these leaders about all the challenges in their countries.  How can they treat Christians better?  Human rights, freedom, religious freedom.  But we also get to ask them what I asked the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia last year.  I've met him twice now.  I said, I'm curious, I'm guessing, I'm just guessing, that the word evangelical Christianity, that the phrase, is not a term used much here in the Islamic kingdom of Saudi Arabia, right?  The birthplace of Islam.  He said, no, that's probably fair to say that.  I said, well, we have an ordained pastor as part of our delegation, Skip Heitzig, your friend.  And I said, could he just take a moment and explain what is an evangelical Christian?  What does the term mean?  What is it that we believe?  So we can have a basis of understanding as we have these two hours of conversations.  He said, I would love that, please.  So Skip walks through what it means to be an evangelical follower with the leaders of Saudi Arabia.  Amazing.  Wow. ",

Now, Greg, you know the man.  How often do you think the term never-Trumper is used in his presence?  Probably never.  Yeah, I'm thinking from the look in his eye, yeah, not that often.  So, but I believe in honoring... What is honorable?  Giving honor where honor is due.  That's what the Bible talks about.  So there are things he has done right and well.  I believe he will go down in history, no matter what else happens, as the most pro-life president, the most pro-Israel president, the most pro-religious freedom president in history.  This is worthy of honor.  And I was honored to meet him.  I told him, I pray for you every day.  I had disagreements with him.  But it was interesting.  And the first question he asked me, he said, now, he started to say, tell me about yourself.  But then he said, wait.  He turned to the vice president.  He said, Mike, did you just say that Joel's an evangelical?  He said, yes.  He said, Joel, are you an evangelical Christian?  I said, I am, Mr.  President.  He said, but your name is Joel Rosenberg.  He said, isn't that Jewish?  I said, well, it is.  On my father's side, I'm Jewish.  And I'm an Israeli citizen, a dual U.S.-Israeli citizen.  It means I get to vote twice.  It's sort of like living in Chicago.  He goes, I don't understand how can you be Jewish and believe in Jesus?  This is the first moments of our discussion.  And I'm like, Lord, get out.  Are you kidding me?  The first conversation, the first time I've ever been in the Oval Office, the President of the United States asked me, what it means to be a Jewish follower of Jesus, I was a very happy person.  And we had a fascinating conversation.  And I do, I pray for the president every day and his wife and his family.  Yes, for wise decisions, but the amount of tack of any president.  And I would go, you know, if President Obama had invited me, he didn't, but I would go.  If the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, probably the most vilified human being on the planet right now, certainly in the top 10, If he asks me to come, I will come. ",

I mean, you know, and I was shocked.  Then while we were waiting for the photographer, I said, you know, I did write another book besides the Persian Gamble.  He goes, oh yeah, what's that?  I said, it's called the Kremlin Conspiracy.  Oh my gosh, you've seen the look in his eyes then, right?  What he's been accused of.  I said, it has nothing to do with the allegations against you.
