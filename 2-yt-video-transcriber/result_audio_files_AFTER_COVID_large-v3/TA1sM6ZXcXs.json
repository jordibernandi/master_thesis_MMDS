Does Todd White believe the canonic Christ heresy?  In today's video I'm going to show you Todd teaching this in context and you can judge whether his critics were right in warning others of his false teaching.  in my film american gospel christ alone i presented clips which show todd white preaching the canonic christ.  jesus was not born into this world to be god which says that jesus was fully god but in the incarnation he emptied himself of all divinity which means his divine nature.

The film counters this view by explaining the biblical view of Christ.  He was fully God and fully man, but he never emptied himself of divinity or his divine nature.  He emptied or humbled himself by adding to himself the veil of humanity. ",
