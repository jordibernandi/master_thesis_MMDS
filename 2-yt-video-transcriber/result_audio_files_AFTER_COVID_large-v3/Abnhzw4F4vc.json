I'm usually a pretty upbeat kind of person.  I can get pretty dark sometimes, but generally I'm pretty upbeat these days, these last few years.  And then there's some days when I'm not, and I kind of am going, why am I not as happy as I could be?  Why am I not as joyful as I could be?  I was thinking about this on days that when I'm not joyful, how can I be more joyful?  And I remember reading a quote from my spiritual tradition about how if you're feeling low or feeling down or kind of feeling bad about yourself, you can make yourself feel better by doing something positive for someone else.  And this actually increases your happiness.  There was a study with the kind of the grandpappy of positive psychology, this guy, Dr.  Martin Seligman, and his students did a happiness test.  They took a happiness test when they first got to his class and it was on positive psychology.  So they got a baseline.  And then one weekend he told all the students, go do whatever's gonna make you the most happy.  So they went out, that weekend they got laid, they gambled, they went shopping, they had fun, they played video games, whatever it was.  They came back the next week and he's like, let's take the happiness test again.  They took it again and their scores were down from their original happiness test.  Then the next weekend he's like, I want you to go out and do something for someone else.  I want you to go be of service to someone else.  I want you to do something nice.  I don't care if it's just holding open a door, if it's just calling someone that might be suffering.  and So they went out and they did this and then they reported back what they did.  I called my grandmother or I donated some food to the food bank or I volunteered my time or I held open a door, said a compliment to someone and they took the happiness test. ",
