Check out IfYouOnlyKnewCBD.com or click the link below.  Now, let's get into the headlines.  This has been a massive week, but let's start with yet another rescue operation, Operation Triple Beam OKC, which led to the rescue of five missing children and 262 suspects, which 141 were confirmed gang members.  This, of course, follows the recent series of operations to rescue children like Operation Safety Net and Operation Not Forgotten.  Let's also follow up on stories from last week.  Over 30 GOP lawmakers have called for an investigation into Netflix for the controversial film Cuties, while the star of another Netflix series, Cheer, has been arrested on child abuse.  pornography charges.  The FBI raided the home of Harris as a result of a complaint that he had been requesting and receiving.  pornography on Snapchat, which seems like something all too common these days, is how technology platforms seem to overlook the subject of child porn while highly centering other subjects.  Another topic from last week that continued was the media's failed attempt to attribute the wildfires to climate change, not the 14 individuals so far arrested for arson.  Images of individuals and posts have gone viral, clearly showing individuals with intent on being the cause of arson, as per the Portland Post, encouraging attendees to be water and spread fire.  Now, fortunately, there are many brave American men and women who formed a hillbilly fire brigade, over 1,200 volunteers.  Again, just a positive story you won't necessarily hear about through the mainstream media when the goal of their narrative is to drive fear.  Also regarding the fires, check out these photos posted by the Kate Awakening of perfectly vaporized houses with trees still intact just a few feet away.  Obviously, the media won't touch this story, but it's been made public that both China and Russia have energy weapons in space.  And I expect to hear about the unveiling of new space technology and the discovery of new life, like this article discussing traces of phosphine gas that could be containing microbes.  There's a satellite expected to be taking another closer look in the near future, so I expect to hear about this again soon and all they discover.  But going back to the topic of space, And also given the POTUS recent withdrawal of troops from the Middle East, all the peace treaties and desires to end wars, this will give the USA Industrial Military Complex incentive for the USA to champion space by transitioning to manufacturing for space, which will also include the mining of materials in space, as well as this lunar gold rush implies.  but they're not talking about actual gold.  it's about helium-3 which has potential for clean nuclear fusion driven power.  expect to hear a lot more about space and the space force and especially anything that the media can use to clog the news cycle like They will with the passing of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, which we will get to later in the report.  You can expect just about anything to come up as a distraction from the public.  Should any indictments come forward regarding the Durham investigation and all the other investigations taking place, Bash, Hubert, Grassley, that has the deep state, the mainstream media, and the Dems panicking at new record levels.  How else do we know they're panicking?  Well... Because with the exception of Fox, we aren't hearing about anything regarding investigations on the mainstream media whatsoever.  with the exception of the Senate Democrats, which includes Harris, calling for a probe into the investigations.  And why do they want a probe?  Well, this too is panic.  You don't call for a probe when you're the ones in control.  The senators are calling into question whether the Durham investigation will interfere with the election.  But as we already know, this rule only applies if you're running for election.  Remember a while back, how Barr appeared before the house.  And they wouldn't so much as let him speak, so they couldn't hear him directly.  But like I mentioned last week, there's been zero leaks.  So there's terror and even denial, like with Peter Stroke, who's refusing to voluntarily appear before the Senate at the request of Lindsey Graham and is publicly questioning the investigation.  But we know this is panic.  A large number of ex-Obama officials, 35 of them, have been sent subpoenas to appear before the Senate, including Comey.  Here's the full list.  Again, you're not hearing about this.  They are silent on the subject and what is going on.  because they are the ones on trial, and they cannot escape while more and more information surfaces, just like the 31 phones that were wiped from the Mueller team.  Everything they tried to run from is coming back to haunt them.  Nothing can stop this while everything they try to do continues to fail.  Adam Schiff had recently come forward with yet another whistleblower.  No one took him seriously, and it appears that it's already blown up in his face when the email itself was released.  Nothing is working, and That is making them panic.  Imagine how this is making them panic.  That Sidney Powell is on the shortlist to be the new head of the FBI when Ray's replaced.  Flynn's lawyer becoming the head of the FBI.  Do you think that would create panic?  I believe so.  How else can you sense that there's panic?  Well, here's a tweet from Jenna Jameson.  Apparently Tom Hanks has just deleted three years worth of tweets in the last hour.  And you know who else is panicking?  Prince Andrew.  How else can you tell there's panic in general?  Well, you can also tell when the MSM gets sloppy and shows footage from a Trump rally in order to demonstrate how strong Latina support is for Biden while they're still wearing Trump hats.  How else can you tell there's panic?  You could tell by the silence of big tech when there's mass distrust from the public.  In this study, the majority of Americans are concerned about big tech's economic and political power.  Also, while they deny the charges, Facebook was sued for allegedly spying on Instagram users through the camera.  And again, you're not hearing about these stories from the mainstream media or posted on social media.  You could tell there's panic when the deep state is getting called out on everything.  After the mainstream media ran articles touting Harris for wearing Timberland boots when Governor Newsom shot his propaganda video blaming the fires on climate change, the property owner called them both out for trespassing.  The overwhelming public isn't buying this and is calling them out on everything.  Whereas with the president, you've seen parade after parade after rally.  Here's the rally schedule for this week alone and check this out.  Another parade with John Deere tractors.  After an estimated over $2 billion in damage, Nancy Pelosi has been forced to walk back her statements and condemn the riots.  The entire narrative is falling apart and she's being forced to walk back her earlier positions.  this poll which gauges support for blm is showing a 10-point drop.  also 84 of black votes fear lawlessness and want the police protected.  a fox poll shows more voters consider the unrest riots and not protests.  the strategy backfired.  the average person is turned off to the average person.  the rights are not appealing.  listen to these protesters talk about supporting black criminals.  It's all falling apart, the entire narrative, the 16-year plan and, well, just about everything.  The president announced this week to take a measure with an initiative to reinforce the education system, to make sure that Americans are taught a patriotic history and to make sure this never happens again.  It's all backfired, all of it.  Dems are switching parties.  The walkaway movement is now massive.  Also, the Seattle mayor, who allowed Chaz to even happen, well, she's definitely panicking because she may be facing federal charges for failing to protect her city.  By the way, this wasn't the only time Pelosi was getting called out.  At first it was for the hair, then it was for the gyms, and now we see that Pelosi also attended a mass in San Francisco while the state was in lockdown.  By the way, Pelosi is the only person being called out for walking back statements publicly.  So was Joe Rogan.  And this is, of course, after Joe Rogan made statements that the source of the fires was arson caused by a group of people versus the failed climate change narrative.  Well, obviously, Rogan is a paid actor.  He works for the left.  And he has to keep to the script, and especially with his new contract from Spotify.  But going back to Pelosi and rioting, Barr has now told prosecutors to charge rioters with sedition.  Like the president's previous order, to anyone caught damaging a statue was punishable with a 10-year sentence.  Sedition is a 20-year federal crime that immediately resulted in the quieting of riots in almost every state.  In fact, the siege was even canceled.  There was an Occupy Wall Street group that had planned a 50-day siege on the White House.  And since the announcement of the sedition charges, well, no one has showed up.  That is until Friday night when these arrests were recorded in New York City.  Momentum looked like it was growing until the announcement of the passing of Ruth Bader Ginsburg.  And when that happened, it all just sort of stopped.  Now, yes, there was some activity in Portland over the weekend, but for the most part, attention was turned completely towards the passing of Ginsburg.  Now, a few patriots noticed something that was off on the different timestamps.  It didn't match up with the other publications by 10 hours from the New York Times.  Strangely enough, this feeling was that of deja vu from a year ago when Fox accidentally announced Ginsburg deaths one year early.  Interesting to note that the time of death always also coincides with the Jewish tradition, as Dave wrote in this post.  But given the cult like ritual behavior, the deep state, the timing is probably not a coincidence.  Now, there's many that believe she may have died a year ago.  And there's also theory circulating that maybe she wasn't the real Ginsburg.  And since then, there's also been hardly any images that have surfaced of Ginsburg seen in public.  Now, I do believe that the timing is not a coincidence, but for a whole different reason.  I believe that the deep state, the Dems and the MSM are planning to cause chaos after the elections.  and that this event will now become a catalyst to be used to manipulate the public.  now what did immediately surface upon her passing was that her dying wish was not to be replaced until there is a new president in the white house.  well you can say what you wish but this will not change the way the government works.  obviously liberals exploded as they have in the past with Threats to incite violence and unrest, threats to burn it all down and create mass riots were posted, became viral.  Even media figures like Reza Aslan, who used to have a show on CNN, also made these claims.  There were even anger directed at Ginsburg for not dying in 2021.  Now, it didn't help that AOC called to radicalize Democrats because of the passing of Ginsburg.  Post calling to kill Mitch McConnell also went viral as protesters assembled in front of McConnell's house.  The timing is questionable since immediately following the president was sent a package containing the poison ricin.  Now, despite the public tantrums in the past, Obama was in favor of an immediate call to replace the empty seat.  Hashtag do your job.  Here you can see that Schumer echoed the same words and now has done 180 degree turnaround demanding that we wait until after the elections.  Rogan O'Hanley pointed out, it's the people's seat, and right now it's empty.  Now, this puts Trump into the position of power, as he can nominate the next justice with the help of McConnell.  Unfortunately, I think we can all expect for this to become another Kavanaugh, and that there'll be attacks on whoever is nominated.  However, I'd say that the most important takeaway from this is that this may have thrown a wrench into the plan to stall the elections and cause chaos.  With this event, we now have the stage set for more riots, while we also know that China is making fake ballots that the Democrats are hoping to push into the election into a legal battle where it's decided by the Supreme Court.  Now, even if the president were not going to get his pick, and Murkowski, Collins, and Romney were not to merely abstain, but they vote against the president's Supreme Court nominee, it would equal a 50-50 Senate vote, making the vice president, Mike Pence, the tiebreaker.  I do believe that this is checkmate.  Now, I entitled the report, Checkmate, Rig for Red, Keep Charging Midnight Riders for a Good Reason.  Well, first, because we are at a series of checkmate positions where the narrative is running out of moves.  They're boxed in and the exits are blocked up.  In the meantime, rig for red, the nautical submarine term, which means to dim the light red for night vision and get ready as the Patriots prepare to release more sense information that helps the Patriots and is damning to the deep state.  Keep charging, Midnight Riders.  We are in the home stretch.  Folks, I hope you liked this video.  If you like my work, please support the channel.  There's a few ways you could do this.

Even better, you could share the video because... want to either share the information or just support for the channel.  in fact i'm relying on you to share because i'm hidden from most searches.  you can follow the social media on twitter on facebook on parlor and it looks like dan bongino is trying to create a video hosting company that allows for conservative views called rumble.  that does sound promising.  by the way i do post different stuff on every platform so you have a reason to follow me on all these different social media networks as well as to stay connected in case i get deleted next which is more than possible considering X-22 was just issued a strike inevitably.  He was suspended and several others.  Here's James Woods noting how his follower list is shrinking.  Even our favorite anon is suggested to all of us.  to avoid talking about the number 17, which is advice I'll be taking, but there's definitely rabbit holes I want to return to when it's safe.  I do also have a PayPal account if you want to make a donation.  Folks, I do have a confession in that I have yet to make a single dollar off of any of these videos.  Even after 1.2 million views, Google's yet to cut any check from when the videos were monetized.  And now they're not monetized.  So if you want to be my first patron and send me the first dollar after hundreds of hours of video editing, that'd be amazing.  Because I do like doing these videos.  Now, obviously, I don't do this for the money.  Like you, I'm a midnight rider sharing information with fellow patriots online.  Like you, I am doing this for God and country, but producing this show does take up a lot of time without any monetary incentive.  So I do ask you to please support the channel in any way that you can.  There is one more thing that you could do to show support, and that is to check out If You Only Knew CBD.
