Cardi B is relatable to every black woman in this country.  So if you hate Cardi B, you hate black women.  I mean, Cardi is a leader.  She's like Rosa Parks or some shit, you know?  I mean, in fact, I think she's actually better than most of those women.  I mean, really, let me ask you this question for real.  Let me just ask you this.  Could Frances Quest Welsing, did she ever sell a million records?  You know, could Harriet Tubman do the splits while riding down a pole?  For reals, really?  Could she do that?  You know, could Lauryn Hill twerk while she was standing on her hands?  Seriously, I mean, you got to give credit where it's due.  You know, could Winnie Mandela, like, literally swallow a tennis ball?  Could she?  You know, I heard a wise woman say once that she basically said, fuck these self-respecting assholes. ",

At the end of the day, me being a hoe, like these people say, like, honestly, I liberate a lot of hoes.  You feel me?  When I hear Cardi talk about popping some pussy, me and my bitches is witty.  Like, that liberate us because it's like, fuck you, self-respect ass hoes.  How y'all got self-respect?  Like, I don't think y'all got self-respect like that because, first of all, you supposed to tax these niggas.  That's self-respect. ",

            "text": "Self-respect, self-respect's overrated.  Like, self-respect is fake news.  Self-respect is fake news, for real.  You know, because self-respect gets in the way of you getting that money.  I mean, getting that shmoney.  I mean, how are you going to get paid if you don't tax these niggas?  You know, if you give up the pussy, you better be getting you a watch.  You better be getting you some shoes.  You better be getting you some Wendy's coupons.  I mean, at least that had a nigga.  take you to White Castle or something.  I mean, for real, like how are you gonna like give up the pussy and walk away empty handed?  That don't even make sense.  That makes no economic sense whatsoever.  That doesn't even, that's an irrational investment.  Why would I want my daughters to be self-respecting?  Like, why would I want my daughters, what, so they can stay broke?  I mean, what, so they can stay broke?  I mean, you got to liberate these hoes, for real.  You got to, you know, I'm kind of like an underground railroad up in this motherfucker.  I mean, best thing you can do for the black community is to liberate all hoes.  Like, there should be hoes in every house.  Hoes in every house.  Facts.  Facts.  Yeah, I actually did make black history.  I made black history.  I was the first black man to ever be accepted into the Ku Klux Klan.  Now, I know what you're thinking, right?  People think that they're racist and they don't like black people, but they were very, very nice to me.  I mean, they gave me money.  They invited me in for dinner.  They made plans with me.  They even gave me an award.  Facts, facts, facts.  Yeah, yeah, I did start a record label recently.  Yeah, thank you for asking.  It's called White Hood Records.  And White Hood Records, you know, I did get money.  Again, I told you, the Klan's not racist.  David Duke financed the whole operation, you know, as part of his affirmative action program.  And so David Duke, with that money, with that, sorry, excuse me, with that money, we're going to go in, we're going to go hard.  We're going to go hard to pay.  We got some artists coming out this fall.  One of them, we got Lil Lit Ass Nigga coming out in September.  And then after that, we got Big Wet Sloppy Vagina.  She's coming out.  Oh, she can rap.  And then we got another artist called Suckin' and Fuckin'.  Like, that's it.  It's just Suckin' and Fuckin'.  Every song is Suckin'.  You suckin' something or you fuckin' something.  It's like Suckin' and Fuckin'.  Suck in that bucket, suck in that bucket.  It's lit, man, for real, for real.  And then our biggest artist that we got coming out like this next spring is Thotlicious.  Now check this out, Thotlicious, you know everybody's into transgender and transgender.  Thotlicious is not a man and is not a woman, it's a transgender.  It's a person, he's a dude, woman, who will pop that pussy And then fuck you in the ass.  Like he's going to pop the pussy on you.  Then he's going to put it in your butt.  Right?  And then he's going to sell you some crack.  And then he will shoot you in the head.  Tell me facts.  Facts.  Tell me that's not lit.  Facts.  Oh, no, no.  At White Hood Records, we would never speak negatively.  We don't do hate speech at White Hood Records.  We would never speak negatively about the Jewish community or the Asian community.  We don't do hate speech.  I mean, we got our niggas and our bitches and our thots and thugs and skanks and tricks.  and hoes.  but but they all black you know.  so we can't be racist because they all black and we don't speak negatively on any community.  i mean i i just keep it clean i just keep it 100 we keep it respectful for everybody for real.  Yeah, yeah, I do have daughters, you know, and my hope is that my daughters can have a STD by the age of seven.  I've been exposing them to lots of Cardi, lots of Megan, you know, so we can talk about what it means to like sell that, get that shmoney, you know, and stuff like that.  And I just want them to be ready to get that shmoney.  I mean, you know, that's the American dream, you dig?  I mean, if you get that shmoney, then you are a natural black leader, you are a winner, you are successful.  In fact, you know, people, a lot of people, see, people don't be thinking.  They don't be thinking.  They don't be thinking.  They be giving them fake news and stuff, right?  So we're not anti-baby daddy in my house.  Like, we're actually pro-baby daddy.  I mean, look, check this out.  Let me explain why.  Okay, so the more baby daddies you have... the more you can tax these niggas, right?  So how many, if you got four babies, daddies, you got four niggas you can tax, right?  And then they always talking about they want father figures for the children.  Well, you got four babies, daddies, that's four father figures.  That's definitely better than one.  Come on, people gotta think.  People don't be thinking no more.  So positive music.  What do you mean by positive?  You mean like HIV positive music?  Like HIV positive music?  Well, you know, little lit ass nigga.  I mean, shoot, that nigga ain't wore a condom since 2015.  You dig?  Now, just so you know, he does wear a mask.  So he does not give any of his hoes the coronavirus.  Yeah, I heard that fake news, you know, that swinging from the pole and selling your coochie at the age of 18.  I heard that that can cause, you know, depression and make you suicidal and put you in abusive relationships and all that.  But that's fake news.  That's fake news.  Facts.  Facts.  That's fake news.  Facts.  You know, that's that's really, you know, I think that's just the price you got to pay to keep it real.  You know, like that's again, we live in the American dream.  We are black excellence.  People don't want to accept that.  I mean, but if I'm Gucci down and I got jewelry and I got much money, sorry, money, I got money.  Then how can I not be black excellence?  How can I not be a successful black person if I got so much money?  And I got hoes and I got guns and I got... Yeah, but the music, you know, I personally think that it's up to the parents.  You know, it's up to the parents.  The parents are the ones.  I really I mean, sure.  OK, yeah.  You know, you got it's on TV every day.  It's on every commercial.  It's on every radio station.  It's on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Nickelodeon.  Right.  All their friends are talking about it at school.  We got Cardi on a cereal box.  But if you still can't stop your children from listening to our music, then you failed as a parent.  I mean, this is for grownups, grown folks.  You know, if you if you are too bad of a parent to stop your children from listening to the music that's on every single radio station, every TV station and their friends are talking about it at school, then you have failed.  It is your job to protect your children, not my job.  I don't give a fuck about your kids.  I want them out there getting this money.  You know, they do talk about, you know, the music and and getting the black boys to, you know, to talk about the killing and stuff like that, that that can cause them to go to prison and get killed and all that.  But but really, you know, I think prison, I personally think prison is good, you know, good for you.  I mean, first of all, it gives you discipline.  You get plenty of time to read books and stuff.  You can pick up a new hobby and let you check.  I mean, when you get done.  Your street cred is like on 10, so you can go sell a whole bunch of records afterward, right?  So it's kind of like being a veteran or some shit.  So prison, they say prison's bad, but it's kind of, that's fake news.  Facts, that's fake news, you know?  Like facts, for real. ",
