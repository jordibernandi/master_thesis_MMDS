            "text": "So a big question right now, how do we vote safely during a pandemic?  The issue, just to state the obvious, is that election day can look like this, or this, or this.  And during a public health crisis, people may want to avoid that kind of scene.  So the obvious solution here is vote by mail.  It's safe and it's easy, but how does it work?  And how do we make it happen in time?  That's what we're covering here.  But first, some voting history.  Once our Constitution was ratified in 1788, the newly formed country had to figure out how the voting process would work.  Back then, it was rarely on paper.  A person's vote was often cast in public, not in secret.  The officials would count actual heads in a room, Federalists to one side, Republicans to another.  And in places where voting happened by ballot, you voted by tossing a ball, a pea, or sometimes a bullet into a box.  The process has evolved a lot over time.  We adapted, much as we're adapting now.  So back to the present day.  The first step to ensuring a safe and fair election during the pandemic is expanding access to vote by mail and access to early voting periods.  The good news is that five states already conduct their elections almost exclusively by mail, and their turnout is almost 10% higher than the rest of the country.  And then another 29 states permit every eligible voter to request an absentee ballot and vote by mail.  But other states have eligibility rules to vote by mail, and there can be a looming threat of criminal prosecution if you get it wrong. ",
