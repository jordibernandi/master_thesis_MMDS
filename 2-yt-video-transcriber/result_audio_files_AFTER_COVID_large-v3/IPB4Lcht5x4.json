            "text": "Hello and welcome back to Redirecting.  In this video, I am going to be talking about Dwayne Wade's ex-wife and her decision not to support her son's decision.  Many of you know what that is.  He's 12 years old.  He's decided he wants to do a change up.  He wants to be a girl, and his mother still refers to him as her son.  He's getting support from his father, however, Dwayne Wade, and his wife, Gabrielle Union.  And so what I wanted to talk about in this is how the world views these things these days, right?  Now, his mother, the 12-year-old boy's mother, has a right to feel the way that she does, right?  But this world, especially in the West, will try to make it seem as though this woman is somehow cruel, wicked, unsupportive, and just all kinds of things because she doesn't accept this.  So bottom line is whatever a child does, whatever choices they make here in the West, You're a horrible parent if you don't support that child's choice.  Now, we have biblical beliefs and understandings about things that have just totally thrown out of the window, even among Christians, right?  But if that child decides that he wants to be a dog or be a rat or be some animal or he wants to marry a dog or whatever.  So are you saying here in the West that a parent is not allowed to go against that child's belief?  What if the child decides he wants to rob banks or just commit crimes?  They want to identify as a criminal.  Is that going to be okay?  So when it comes to something like this, whereas, you know, times before, times before, you know, it would have been something where a person would say, you know, maybe we should talk to the child.  Definitely not allow him to just jump into something like this at this age.  they can't even drink or smoke legally can't even get married legally but you're telling me that a child could say look this is what i want to do.  i want to change my body and i want to be something that i wasn't born as and that everyone is supposed to go along with.  that this mother has a right as the woman who gave birth to this child.  she has a right to reject that choice that this child has made, which is something she, she didn't endorse or push.  I mean, he wants to be called Ziya.  His name is Zion.  Okay.  It says his ex-wife still refers to him as Zion, her son, but he wants to be called Ziya, a daughter.  This woman does not have to abide by that.  She has every right to feel the way that she does, but we know how society is.  She will be the bad one.  They will make her out to be the villain.  She will be the one that everyone's going to frown upon.  But if he goes out and he does things wrong in the world, they're going to say, oh, you did a horrible job raising him.  Hmm.  I agree with what this commenter said here.  It says at the end of the day, she is the child's biological mother and she is still alive.  And who gave rights to him and Gabrielle Union to act as though she doesn't exist.  I agree with that statement there.  I agree with that.  Huh?  So that was my take on this.  I just wanted to weigh in on this because right now we see a lot of stuff, a lot of stuff happening in and around the black community and believe it or not, our people are affected by this one way or another.  I have those who say, well, why do we care about these things?  Because we're in the truth or whatever.  You have to understand more people watch my channel than just those who are in the truth.  OK, there are people who have opinions about these things.  And I want my opinion to be known to them because I have people telling me to mind my own business in regards to.  What Boosie had to say about this, but some of these same people who are telling me to mind my own business and telling others to mind their own business would look at the mother as well as though she is a villain in all of this.  As if she has no right or any say so in the decisions that are being made concerning her son.  This right here is truly a sad day to me to see the direction that we are going as a people.  We are blending right in and conforming to Western society.  Yes, that is what's happening.  And anyone who speaks out against this conformity, again, is viewed as a villain.  But Regardless to how people feel, the scripture tells us to cry aloud and spare not and lift up our voices like trumpets in Zion and show our people their transgressions, right?  While at the same time, we do look in the mirror, okay?  A lot of people don't understand that we ourselves, we ourselves, when we speak and when we teach, we understand that we all speak.  have repentance and that we all have things that we need to get together and that none of us are perfect.  We get that and we understand that, but that does not mean that we don't speak out against the things that we see happening in the black community.  See, Many times because someone is rich and they're a celebrity, you'll have people who will defend them no matter what.  You see, they will defend them no matter what.  And dare anyone to say anything about what these people are doing because they are celebrities.  No, that's not how it works.  Regardless to what is being done or said or spoken by celebrities, we have to speak the truth regardless.  Okay.  And so I commend this mother for her stance.  Hopefully she will stand strong in that because sometimes pressure from the outside can cause people to kind of step back from their convictions.  You see, this world right now is going in a direction that is just completely godless.  Okay.  They're going, going in a direction that is, uh, self-fulfilling, um, desires, lust, lustful desires, whatever their flesh wants.  That's what they do.  And so it actually takes a lot of boldness and strength to stand up for what you believe in.  Okay.  When it comes to the truth, because there is no shortage of people standing up for what they believe in, in the direction of unrighteousness, right?  So those who stand for righteousness, we need to stand even taller because everybody else is doing what they want to do.  Okay.  And so we've got to cry aloud and spare not.  We don't have to accept these lifestyles because Western cultures say that it's okay and there's nothing wrong with it.  When the same Western culture in times past looked at a lot of this stuff like it was a mental illness.  But as time wears on, there are people and laws and things being passed to endorse this and frowning on anyone who doesn't agree with such lifestyles.  Okay?  To the mother of this 12-year-old boy, my hat's off to you in this instant for your stand on this.  I'm out. ",
