            "text": "Look at these dumbasses.  Look at them.  You're now live to the Internet.  You're now live to the Internet.  You're now live to the Internet, buddy.  That's great.  That is good, sir.  Have a good one.  Goodbye.  Why am I recording?  for my safety?  Doing the same thing.  Are you armed?  No, I am not.  They are.  And you asked me, you asked me, you asked me, but now you're nervous and you took off your badge.  So who are you?  It's none of your business who I am.  I'm a member of the public.  Okay.  I'm a member of the public.  You are, you are correct.  Then get away from me.  No.  It's my right to be here too.  You're in your official capacity.  You're supposed to be on base and this is public property.  Please go away.  You're not part of the public.  You are in military gear.  You are on public.  How is it security?  How is it a security threat?  I'm not on your base.  So?  That's public.  That's fine.  It's kind of creepy, sucker.  I'm sorry.  It's creepy for you, big boy.  Give me a break.  All you guys are armed.  And you come out here and run your mouth.  Providing security to the installation.  Security inside those gates.  Correct.  Where am I standing?  Is this your property?  Is that a crime?  To be very suspicious, yes.  No, it's not.  We'll see.  What is your articulate suspicion that I have?  Why are you being so?  That I'm suspicious.  Why are you being so?  You can't even say it.  You're looking dumb right now.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  You're very welcome.  Continue to be.  You're very welcome.  Not very nice.  What are you, corporal?  Private?  What?  I'm going to let you figure that out.  Okay.  That's very professional of you.  Very professional of you in the military.  I don't know who you are, sir, so I'm not giving you information.  It doesn't matter.  I'm part of the public.  It doesn't matter.  Okay.  The public doesn't get everything.  I don't owe you anything, sir.  And why should I?  Then you're telling me that I owe you.  But you are causing people to be nervous.  You're telling me that I owe you something.  No, you're causing people to be nervous.  So therefore, I'm just going to wait for the authorities to get here with this.  Right there.  Perfect.  Perfect.  This is public property.  What's your name and badge number?  Roger Ryder.  Okay.  Your badge number, please.  I have to give you my name or badge number, not vote.  You have to give vote.  No, you don't.  It's part of your policy, isn't it?  It's not, sir.  You might want to read our policy first.  What is yours?  Officer Sink.  What is it?  Officer Sink.  Sink?  Yeah, S-I-N-K.  So what are you doing?  Doing the story on the base.  What do you work for?  I don't have to divulge that.  I'm not going to tip media members after this.  Yes, we do.  Good journalists use it to do this.  Good journalists... Usually, a good journalist has their anonymity, right?  Anonymity?  What's that?  Being anonymous.  Are you that dumb?  Are you really that dumb?  I didn't know what anonymity was.  I'm sorry.  I don't know.  It's a new word.  Am I being detained?  No, it's up to you.  They can't detain me.  They cannot detain me.  Okay, then I'm free to go.  Then I'm free to go.  Goodbye.  I'm going to continue to do what I'm doing.  Sure I am.  Where's your supervisor?  Are you the supervisor?  Well, then you better get somebody hired.  Because I've already dealt with IMPD on recording in public.  What problem is this?  You're trying to elicit a response from us.  No, I'm not.  Everything was just fine.  I already talked to the state trooper, and he didn't have a problem.  What was his name?  I don't know.  It's on my report.  You guys saw him.  Yeah, you get everybody's name and badge number, so let's see what it is.  You're public service, dum-dum.  Are you really that dumb?  Are you really that dumb?  You're not the one that said anonymity.  Okay, so I misspoke.  Oh, no.  That's like a typo.  Are you the grammar police?  Are you the grammar police?  Are you law enforcement?  Then go enforce some laws.  See, look.  Look at all these cars for a guy with a camera.  I'm on public easement.  There's no sidewalk here.  How?  I'm not on the base.  You have a right to record and do all that, but not every place.  I can record whatever my eyes can see.  Are you that dumb?  Are you ILEA certified?  Are you ILEA certified?  Have you been updated on public photography?  What's the difference if I'm over there, if I'm over here?  Well, if you're filming right here, it's not your property.  Go pull up the GIS survey.  Go pull up the GIS survey because you're looking dumb.  We're going to get a lawyer who's smarter than all of us probably.  I know the law.  I'm on public easement.  You cannot trespass my eyes and you cannot trespass me from public easement.  Second, thirdly, I'm doing a story on the base.  I'm not going to tip my hat on what my story is.  My story may be you all now.  Okay, I'm independent.  Four or five others.  You guys are.  I'm going to disengage.  Am I free to go still?  Yeah, please leave.  I'm not leaving.  I'm going to continue.  If I'm free to go, I'm free to stay.  No, that doesn't make any sense.  You're looking dumb.  So I need somebody out here that's higher than you.  Your supervisor.  Why not?  I've requested it.  I'm working right now.  Okay.  Well, then you're making INPD look really dumb.  We're not going to... Sir, you can record across the street, but you can't be here.  I can record from right here.  Actually, our lawyer says no.  Your lawyer's wrong.  So we can ask them to move you.  So you can trespass if he refuses to leave the courtroom.  No, sir.  I'm not welcome to be here right now.  Look, let me explain.  I have to get my bike first.  You're trespassing right now.  Okay, well, I'm in the street then.  This is not fair property.  Well, I'm going to get the exact letter of the law here.  Then you go.  do your act.  Goodbye.  Is your PIO here now?  Not here now.  Okay.  Why don't you guys clean up the debris out here?  If this is your property, why don't you clean up the debris?  Asshats.  I'm not leaving.  I'm just going to be on the road.  I'm going to go down here far enough that they can't do nothing.  They can't say nothing.  I'm off property.  Thanks.  Goodbye.  You're going to make a mistake if you put me under cuffs.  See, that's how you should be.  What did everybody do when they were young?  Hey, Mom, for the camera, right?  Why do I have to go across the street?  You guys are trying to trespass me off of public property.  Did they put those telephone poles up?  Did they put the speed limit signs up?  I don't know.  But if they're going to say that it's cool if you film right there... You guys need to... You guys are law enforcement.  Before you start talking, before you start talking, do you listen to me?  Just hang out right there.  I can get the same thing from over there as I can from right here.  What's the difference?  So what's the difference?  This is freedom.  I don't care if I'm causing them problems.  You cannot make... Yeah.  He's probably getting told right now that I'm in poverty.  I'm off property.  If he says that this is their property, which is grass, they do not own the street.  Okay.  So you're saying that you're in the street, right?  I'm on the curb.  There has to be a walk.  Okay.  There has to be an easement.  There is no sidewalk.  I have to be able to ride my bike down through here safely or walk.  They cannot trespass me.  33 feet from the center line has to be and even further because there's telephone poles there.  They didn't put the telephone poles there.  So here he's coming over here.  Okay.  Are we going to clarify?  Here's your options.  Are we going to clarify?  Here's your options.  Are we going to clarify?  Here's your options.  Are we going to clarify?  Here's your options.  Are we going to clarify?  Here's your options.  You can stand over there.  You're going to have a lawsuit if you do anything.  Because here you're impeding traffic.  Okay.  Here is their property.  You're in a state... No, sir.  There has to be an easement for I can walk down through here or ride my bike.  Because there's no sidewalk, there's no six-foot easement.  You see a sidewalk?  You see a sidewalk?  There has to be an easement.  There is a utility... Take that under the DOT.  You're the mayor's office.  There is no easement.  There is no sidewalk.  Are you zoning?  I'm telling you the law is.  Okay.  I'm telling you the law is.  Are you zoning?  I'm telling you the law is.  Okay.  Why don't you go?  Do me a favor.  Here's your options.  Do me a favor.  You can get out of the street.  I'm not.  I'm on the third thing.  It's not their property.  You can go over there or you can go.  Okay, explain to me what the difference is between me over there and over here.  Because this is their property.  That's not their property.  It is not their property.  It is their... Please, do me a favor.  Somebody pull up the GIS survey.  I went up to a major who's a jack.  It doesn't matter.  Please, pull up the GIS survey before you make a mistake.  If you don't get out on the street and you don't leave, if you don't go over there or leave, you're going to get locked up.  For what crime?  For impeachment.  And even what traffic?  Because cars can turn right here.  They can, but they can clearly see me.  Sir, I'm trying to be cordial.  They can see you, but you're still violating the law.  Okay.  You're being a pain in the butt.  No, I'm trying to be cordial with you.  You're being a pain in the butt on purpose.  Don't get loud with me.  You're wasting officers' time to deal with you.  We could be out serving the community right now.  Then go do it.  You're law enforcement.  What law am I breaking?  What law?  He said, over there.  go sir what law am i breaking you are breaking.  you're impeding traffic.  how am i impeding traffic?  i am not in.  that is the street.  that is where they drive.  this is a place.  this is a turn lane.  this is a place that this is a place that the public if you say if you say that there's no public sidewalk this is the sidewalk.  Sir, the city did this.  This is city property.  You cannot trespass me from city property.  And I'm not blocking anybody.  I can clearly, and I am old enough to get out of any car's way.  I don't care what JAG says.  JAG is on the base.  This is not base property.  That, where he is standing, is not base property.  Sir, no, it's not.  Those freaking polls, they cannot do that.  I'm standing where I'm standing.  Thank you.  Now can I get your name and badge?  I'm not going to.  I'm standing where I'm standing.  No, sir.  It's not.  Do you want me to pull up the GIS survey and show you that you're wrong?  I'll do it.  I'll do it right now.  I'll pull it up and I will show you you're wrong and how much of an idiot you're going to be.  I'm not in traffic.  I'm clearly far enough back from there.  A car is going to be this close to the curb.  Are they drunk?  You're telling me that they're drunk?  I am.  I'm surprised you being a sergeant that you're not any smarter.  So there has to be public easement for me to get to and from, right?  So this is the good news, okay?  He's going to head over there.  He's going to confirm that you're not going to be breaking any laws by standing where you're at.  But if you are, then we're going to have to act, okay?  You understand that?  I was leaving before six armed men came out and talked to me.  Now I got more armed men.  I was leaving.  But now you guys should leave before I do.  Because I'm not breaking the law.  What law am I breaking?  But he says you guys have better stuff to do.  Then please go do it.  I pay your taxes.  I pay my taxes for you guys to go out and do stuff.  Well, then why don't you go out and do it?  Instead of bothering citizens, this is constitutionally protected activity.  First Amendment.  You swore an oath to that, right?  Did you swear an oath?  Because every citizen in this country is a journalist on the day that they're born.  First Amendment.  First Amendment.  Press.  What is the First Amendment?  Religion.  Press.  Speech.  Okay.  Second Amendment.  I almost came down here with my gun off, which is my Second Amendment.  What's the fourth?  Fourth is being secure in your person, your documents, your papers, your ID.  That's why you guys are not going to get my ID, because I haven't done anything wrong.  Fifth Amendment, right to remain silent.  You know that.  Here's this one.  If you violate an ordinance violation, so if you have a little ordinance violation going on out there and you refuse to identify... What ordinance am I breaking?  So I can't ride my bike on here, right?  Is that what you're telling me?  You're telling me, then why can't I stand here?  What am I blocking?  There's plenty enough room here.  You guys are looking really dumb.  I wish I had the officers that came to the post office a couple of weeks ago because they knew the law.  They knew that I could be in the post office and record all I want.  Real quick, what YouTube channel do you have so I can see myself on it?  I don't have to divulge that.  I just want to see it.  It's cool, man.  You guys probably will be seeing it because I've already had... ISP trained because they violated my rights three separate times and trespassed me, just like you guys are trying to do, trespass me off of a public roadway.  You're with them.  You're trying to make up stuff to get me to leave.  No, I mean, if you keep doing the exact same thing that you're doing over there, then we're cool with that.  Right here, my sergeant, he said to physically care for you hanging out in this turn lane right here.  So what is the difference if I'm over there videoing and I'm over there?  So over here on this side, that's your turn lane once, twice, three times.  It's their property.  We've established that.  It is not their property.  Well, you can record all you want.  You know what you could do?  How about you get a car and then you start driving your car and just, you know, just don't be using it.  Face it towards this way.  I mean, hey, that's wrong, right?  Because then you'd be driving, operating on the street.  Like I said, I was leaving anyway.  So, yeah.  I thought I was detained.  now since he's going to try and charge me with trespassing and all this other stuff.  He's looking up the exact wording of not looking at trespassing anymore.  Okay.  Kind of hanging out in the street.  I'm not hanging out in the street.  You guys are making me hang out in the street.  Okay.  I would be on public easement.  Right there.  That is public easement.
