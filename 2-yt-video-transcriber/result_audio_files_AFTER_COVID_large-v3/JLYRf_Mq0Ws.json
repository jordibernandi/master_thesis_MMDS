            "text": "I'm Uri Geller, and this is my legacy.  I would describe myself, Uri Geller, as a person that actually shocked the world with something quite trivial and surprising.  You see, I always say that the secret of success is originality.  And I came up with something original, something that was never seen before.  So I really shocked the world with that feat.  I look at myself as someone, maybe a freak of nature, maybe a little advanced ahead of my time, maybe something that triggered my mind power.  My mental abilities began at a very early age.  First of all, very few people know this, but when I was about a year old, my mother put me in a pram under a window.  At that time in Israel, it was Palestine, and the British were the rulers in Israel, in Palestine, and a British soldier shot two bullets into our window from across the railroad station.  And I remember that.  I remember the glass shattering, falling slow motion onto my face.  There was a little teddy bear that covered my face and nothing happened to me.  I wasn't even scratched.  So maybe that was a shock.  Maybe that was the actual trigger.  The second experience that happened to me that definitely falls into the category of a shock is the following.  I'm about five years old.  I'm playing in an Arabic garden, magical garden.  And I heard kittens cry.  And as a five-year-old, I'm looking for them.  Suddenly, out of nowhere, I see a huge sphere of light.  It's strobing.  It's almost like a living entity, but it was just a sphere, a ball of fire.  I look at this phenomena, and then I can see with my eyes a beam, almost I describe it today as a laser beam, It hits my forehead and it was so tangible, it's so powerful that it pushes me into the grass.  Now, I don't know how long I lay in the grass, but I ran home to tell my mother.  She didn't believe me.  She thought that I was either dreaming, fantasizing, lying, making it up.  But no, I wasn't making it up.  It happened.  And this is why I adhered to this story through all my life.  I didn't ebb away from it.  I wrote about it in my books.  I talked about it on documentaries.  And really people thought, come on, this is so far out.  It can't be true.  And recently, an Israeli Air Force officer validated this entire scene.  I was talking about this amazing encounter, I'll call it encounter, on a program on the BBC.  That documentary was shown in Israel, and I get an email from a man called Jacobi who says, hey, Uri, I was there.  I saw that sphere.  I saw you.  I saw a little boy running home because the apartment building was very near the garden.  It was maybe 50 meters away.  And he actually validated this story.  And I said, wow, I grabbed the phone.  I called him.  I came to Israel.  I filmed him.  And he says that when I ran away from the sphere of light, the sphere followed me.  And when I got into our entrance into the doorway, the sphere exploded on the facade of our building and kind of tarnished it in a dark residue.  That was it.  So there I had a validation that no, I wasn't making up a story.  I wasn't dreaming it.  When I'm asked today what I think that was, I have a few theories.  Let's talk about the most rational one.  that it was some kind of a geophysical phenomenon.  You know, sometimes the Earth releases different gases and who knows, but they form bubbles and so forth.  Maybe that was a very simple, has a simple scientific explanation.  Next theory, that It could have been a spiritual encounter, something to do with religion maybe, something to do with my belief system, something that I created with my mind, but it was tangible.  It was there.  I could touch it.  The third theory is the most far out one.  that I really had an alien encounter.  I did not see an alien being.  I didn't see the greys with the big eyes.  I saw the sphere.  But after I told this story over and over, I get thousands of emails from people telling me, we had the same encounter.  And we believe it was some kind of a UFO visitation.  It was some kind of an extraterrestrial being trying to communicate with us.  That's a possibility.  I am a believer.  There is nothing I do not believe in.  I believe in infinity.  So everything is possible.  Of course there are UFOs.  Of course there are aliens.  Very soon after this encounter in this magical Arabic garden, I'm eating soup.  I'm lifting a spoon up towards my mouth.  Suddenly, the spoon bends and breaks.  And I'm left holding the handle of the spoon, which maybe I'll demonstrate later.  So my mother looks at me, and I look at the handle, but what does a five-and-a-half, six-year-old kid know?  My mother, again, wasn't surprised, and she thought, oh, well, maybe powers, the paranormal.  You know, we didn't know the word paranormal then.  And then I thought to myself, hang on.  Spoon, can I do it again?  And again, so I tried it in school and I tried it and I showed it to my mother's friends.  Everyone was shocked, surprised, amazed, aghast, say, what is this?  That's when I realized that I had something, something different, something unique.  My friends in school, pupils, they were good in basketball.  They were good in soccer.  They were good in arithmetic.  I was very average, but I was good at bending spoons and reading minds.  And the way I discovered that I could read minds was I was not good in mathematics, in arithmetic.  So I could concentrate on the back of a pupil's head and I would copy the answer.  The teacher didn't know how he got the answer right when the equation was wrongly written.  that I could look at the clock on the wall, willing to move an hour ahead.  So I started discovering things that I could do at a very early age.  Later on in life, I had to label myself.  And of course, I had to always reinvent myself.  And today I look at it as the phenomena, I see it as the field of the paranormal.  There is a section of it that is mind over matter, psychokinesis, telepathy, the ability to do extrasensory perception.  But it was always controversial.  Even in school, even when I was seven, eight, nine year old, children and teachers didn't know how to digest this thing.  Some thought I was a magician.  Some thought it was just some kind of a mind over matter phenomenon.  Nobody really knew.  And I realized then that this is what's going to PUSH ME OUT OF POVERTY BECAUSE WE WERE VERY POOR.  MY MOTHER WAS A SEAMSTRESS.  MY FATHER WAS A WOMANIZER, WAS NEVER AT HOME.  I REMEMBER ME AND MY MOM WALKING TO THE FLEA MARKET.  SHE WOULD BUY OLD AMERICAN PARACHUTES FROM WHICH SHE WOULD SAW DRESSES.  WE WOULD COLLECT PLASTIC BACALITE SPOONS AFTER PEOPLE WOULD EAT THEIR ICE CREAMS AND SHE WOULD WASH THEM AND RESELL THEM.  WE WERE BROKE.  As I was growing up, I used my existential perception, for instance, to make my mother win in card games.  She would take me to a little card club.  She would play a Remy, and I would sit next to her, and I could look at the cards of The other players, which obviously you can't see, but I always knew, I detected who had the joker, or who had two jokers, and I would kick my mother's leg to tell her which person had the joker.  In a way, it was kind of cheating, but I could do that telepathically, and my mother would win quite a lot of money, which would help our existence, because she was the earner.  and in the family, my father wasn't around.  Then my parents divorced and my mother married a Hungarian Jew who lived in Cyprus.  I was 11, didn't know English.  So I left Israel, and suddenly a whole new culture opens up, different religions, Turks, Greeks.  The British also occupied Cyprus at that time.  We're talking about 1957.  And my school was called Terra Santa College.  It was up on a hill, and around the school there were hundreds of caves.  And we would go down into the caves to explore.  And I remember on a few occasions, We got lost, and I would use my mental powers to lead the kids out of the caves.  So I would use these abilities in different areas.  I don't know what it was.  Maybe it was dowsing.  Maybe it was using my extrasensory perception waves, almost like a sonar.  But yeah, I used to do these different unusual things.  And again, everybody was just, wow.  And I already then felt that I was entertaining also people.  Now, my stepfather died a year after my mother married him.  And we left running this little hotel, which had 14 rooms.  The Mossad, the Israeli Secret Service, discovered that we are from Israel, and they turned this hotel into a Mossad safe house.  And there would be Mossad agents, spies.  They would check in, and from there, they would go to spy, you know, in Syria, Egypt.  One day I approached one of these agents.  I must have been 12.  His name was Yoav Shacham.  And I told him, Yoav, you're a spy, aren't you?  He was, what?  What are you talking about?  How do you know?  Why are you saying these things?  To make a long story short, I became, at 12 years of age, a spy for Israel.  You know what I did?  I bent a spoon for him and I did telepathy with him.  And he would tell me, he would give me instructions.  OK, I'm leaving now the hotel, but I'm going to send you letters.  Don't open them.  you get on the bicycle and give them hand them into the hand of the israeli consul in a consulate which wasn't far away from our little hotel establishment and i realized that he was spying say in egypt or in syria.  he would send secret information in letter forms in the envelopes.  i jumped on the bike and drove them down to the consul.  So I knew that I was acting for the Mossad.  And then Yoav says to me, Uri, I can't understand your powers, but you are helping us.  I want you to go back to Israel when you're 18, join the paratroopers, go to office school, and then find me.  And I told him, Yoav, how am I going to find you?  You're going to find me because we are going to use you.  You have amazing, very special abilities that we need.  I'm asked many times if I'm unique in my family, possessing these abilities, these skills, these powers, call it whatever.  I'm an only child.  But having said that, I'm going to touch on something very sensitive and very emotional.  you see my father didn't want children and he forced my mother to go through eight abortions and my mother fought for me.  so maybe there is a connection because i do feel that around me i must have my brothers and sisters maybe angelic form, angels, spirits.  I know I'm not alone.  That was a shock to me when my mother told me that.  So today I'm no brothers, no sisters.  In my family, my son, Daniel, when he was young, he could maybe do some telepathy.  But they tried bending spoons.  My daughter Natalie tried many times, but no one could.  Remember I said before that the secret of success is originality.  And there's nobody who did spoon bending before me.  And how did that come about?  Very interesting.  I was on a major television show.  on the BBC in 1972.  It was called The David Dimbleby Show.  And I'll tell you how it came about.  I'm sitting around this skeptical scientist, and David Dimbleby hands me a spoon.  And he says, show us your powers.  And I hold the spoon.  And suddenly I do something that I've never done before.  I look into the camera like this and I hold up this spoon and I say, everybody at home, go and get your spoons.  I didn't realize that I sent 10 million people to the kitchen.  Everybody came back to the TV screens holding a spoon because no one could fathom, believe that spoons are gonna bend in their own homes, in their living rooms in Scotland, in Wales, in England, in, I mean.  And this is what happened.  I'm reminding you what happened on that show.  I hold a spoon and I stroke it very gently.  And I look at it, and I say, bend, melt, bend, melt.  And look, the metal is becoming almost like plastic.  Plasticine, no heat is produced.  I say, bend, melt, bend.  And look, and then I went like that, and the spoon broke.  melt, bend, melt.  Do you know what happened the instant the spoon broke on the BBC?  The BBC's telephone system blows up.  Not because of me, not because of my energies, but because spoons were bending in people's homes.  When the phone calls were coming in, at that time, the system couldn't take 100,000 calls at the same moment.  And the phenomena was huge.  Not only spoons, Ben, but watches stopped, watches moved, pictures tilted on the walls, lights flickered.  This was a mass phenomenon all over England. ",
