            "text": "I'm going to do well because this is my demo.  You know, people with body oil deals.  That's who really relates to what I talk about.  People with $20 million face cream endorsements.  Give it up for Whitney for doing this for all of us.  How cool is that, you know?  This isn't weird at all.  You know, it's not like Judy Garland's last days at all.  Not at all.  This is, you know, Whitney Hussein here walking around like a psychopath.  Happy 9-11, too.  Those were the good times.  Remember 9-11?  You didn't know it then, but that was, remember?  Going on Fridays, hugging people?  That was the shit.  None of you care about 9-11.  Don't get soft on that.  You didn't do shit after 9-11.  I love that Whitney has more of a budget than all of Comedy Central.  It's amazing.  This is a better production than a Comedy Central half hour.  A Comedy Central half hour right now is just a guy taping you with his phone.  Literally, this is such a tremendous production.  Oh, Delia just got here.  Good.  That's fun.  It's topical.  The point... This is his crown, though.  This is an influencer-heavy... You know, I don't relate to these people.  Whitney always ridicules the skin things that I try.  I have a deal with a very advanced skin cream called Cortisone.  with a low.  And I always come over here and she ridicules me and she gives me whatever bat semen concoction is spent giving her $30,000 to put in her pussy.  I love this crowd because no one has a job.  Do you realize that?  No one in this crowd has a job.  The Disney Channel girl had one, but no one else has a job.  Everyone else just... Loafs around.  Everyone's job in this crowd is to say hello to 20 million.  Hello.  Hi.  What do you do for a living?  I defend Chrissy Teigen.  I'm kidding.  I don't think she's eating kids.  I don't think she's, but yeah, I don't.  I don't know, but I don't think she is.  She's on Twitter too much.  You know, she doesn't have the time.  But it takes work, the sawing of the leg.  I'm kidding.  Many of you are like, oh no, it's getting weird.  This is so fun.  Whitney's chloroforming her dogs.  You know.  COVID.  What a scam.  It's not a scam, but, you know, you just gotta... Has anyone had it here?  Has anyone had COVID here?  No one, huh?  Not you with the hat?  Not one person?  Does anyone know anyone that's had it?  You knew someone that's had it.  Was it bad?  No, it was light.  Oh, God.  Was it long?  Did they lose their sense of smell?  Okay.  What a fun group to do.  Crowd working.  Fun group here.  Nobody can really respond, you know?  Everybody's an industry.  Everyone in this crowd's like a one-person industry.  They're like, I don't know.  Who is this pig?  I don't know.  I don't know what this pig wants.  Nobody knew what this was.  We still don't.  This guy, you see?  He came to LA to make movies, didn't he?  He wanted to change the world.  Now some psychotic rich bitch has got you filming her friends at a basketball court.  Ain't that the way?  Take the mask off, buddy, and let's go see Jesus together.  All right, thanks so much, everyone.  What a treat.  Give it up for Whitney Hussain Cummings.  Who's next?  Spade, who's going up next?  No one?  Olivia Munn?  Who's doing it?  Who's here?  Kesha?  Is Kesha going to do one-liners?  What if Kesha just got up and did racist one-liners and murdered? ",
