These men are our friends, family, neighbors, and colleagues.  Most are adults, but a significant portion are teenagers.  Many of these men started viewing this illegal material as part of their adult porn habit, somehow not noticing or perhaps caring that these were images of children being abused.  So some of them are using this excuse that they were looking at what they believed to be adult porn and not noticing that it was actually images of children, individuals who are underage.  So when I say children, I'm referring to anybody that's, you know, 17 and younger.  And then some of these people are teens.  So one thing I do want to mention is that I've been looking at a lot of studies on the child porn industry in general, done by the Justice Department in conjunction with FBI cases.  You know, a lot of offenders of child sexual abuse are underage.  They are children or young adults themselves.  So I'm not totally shocked by this, that a large or significant portion are teenagers who are calling into this tip line. ",

And of those 1,600 cases, about 33% of those turned out also to be what they call contact offenders, meaning they weren't just looking at images of child abuse, they were acting it out as well.  So in a lot of these instances of people who are having these thoughts and who are viewing this material, we know based off of case studies that at least 33%, I would argue more, but at least 33% of them actually have gone on to or will go on to become contact offenders.  And so if they've viewed or downloaded or shared material, they've committed a crime and should be pursued for that because we know, statistically speaking, there's a high chance of them actually becoming abusers as well.

I personally believe that the more that we elevate this to the top of the mind awareness, just in a general as a society, and the more we pressure our governments to come down hard on these individuals, that is when we're going to start seeing results.  Because the more we turn a blind eye to it, the less they are going to make this a priority.  The less they're going to fund the law enforcement side of things to go after these criminals.

And there have been certain subcultures that have not only accepted it, but have incorporated it and woven it into their culture and created sort of this belief among some people that it's, acceptable within certain parameters.  So that needs to be exposed because I don't think the general population, I think they're just now starting to become aware of this.  And the more we become aware of it, the more that we speak out about it, and the more we pressure for stricter laws, stricter punishments, then the better off we are at deterring it in the future.  And the more savvy that we become as far as who the predators are, where they go, whether it's online or within our communities to access children.
