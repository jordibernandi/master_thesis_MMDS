            "text": "I'm sure this story in particular will be completely ignored by hardline remainers because what it shows is that contrary to their belief, this country is actually admired and well liked around the world.  As Guido Forks has noted, the German media build praising Boris Johnson, Brexit, Boris as described.  I mean, this picture really for some lefties is snowflakes is going to send them into absolute meltdown with Netanyahu, Boris and Trump.  And as Guido reports this story in Build, really focusing on the EU's complete and utter failure when it comes to vaccines and the relative success of Brexit, UK and others in comparison.  As Guido has translated the Build report, since the beginning of the corona pandemic, this trio has been silently mocked and ridiculed by the German government and the EU Commission.  When it came to getting vaccinated, they put Berlin and Brussels in the shade.  have the most successful vaccination campaigns in the Western world on their feet.  The fact is, as of January the 26th, Israel had 32% of its citizens vaccinated against the coronavirus at least once.  In Great Britain, it was at least 10.6%.  In the USA, 6%.  For comparison, Germany has 2%.  The entire EU has just 1.9%.  Instead of haggling over the price for months like the EU Commission did, And of course, I'm the EU.  lucky having this done by unelected EU commissioners that the European public and citizens never voted for and can't be removed.  Lucky them.  Netanyahu bravely grabbed the state wallet.  And now specifically on Boris, as they would describe you, Brexit Boris laid the foundation for vaccination success.  together with AstraZeneca.  Your mission to develop the remedy against Corona together instead of waiting for the EU junk commission.  Johnson ordered 30 million doses of vaccine from by intent Pfizer on the 20th of July.  The British now vaccinating stadiums, clinics and doctors offices.  Now this is a massive story.  Firstly, The backlash in Europe is growing.  It's just been reported today.  Bavarian leader Soda, a favourite to replace Angela Merkel, blames the EU for the vaccine fiasco.  The operational responsibility lay with Europe.  So that's one aspect.  You're going to see an increasing backlash, but longer term.  Brexit Boris being praised, the UK response outside of the EU being far more effective than having it being done by the EU Commission.  I think this is one clear example early on and you're going to see many, many more in the months and weeks ahead that being outside of the EU gives you big advantages and increasingly I imagine Citizens right across the continent, political parties are going to be looking at this and thinking, well, if the British are able to do this outside of the EU and we've been constrained by this EU approach, why on earth would we continue to go ahead with this when it's not in our best interests?  But there you go, guys.
