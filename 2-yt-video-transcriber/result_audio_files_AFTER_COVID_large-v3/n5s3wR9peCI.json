And it's presented by Gloria Alvarez, who is apparently a libertarian political commentator from Guatemala.  I think this video reveals quite a bit about the way that PragerU wants its viewers to think about global poverty.  The video's argument, at least on the surface, is simple.  That the USA is the world's greatest and most prosperous nation because it has small government.  While the home countries of immigrants to the USA are the exact opposite.  They're poor and bad and that's all because they were ruined by big government.  So therefore it doesn't make any sense that those immigrants should vote for the Democratic Party because it wants to bring big government to the USA. ",

Opening a new business can take months, even years, because of a multitude of regulations that are designed to line the pockets of bureaucrats.  So the cost is much too high for the average citizen.

            "text": "So, it's hard to open a business in Guatemala and the government there is corrupt.  Therefore, that means that Guatemala has big government.  According to PragerU, those are the reasons why so many people in Guatemala are poor and want to leave.  And they assert that it's the same in every other Latin American country too.  Now pretty much everything that they use to support their argument here is just factually wrong.  I could fall into the trap here of exhaustively explaining in incredible detail just how wrong every single statement in this video is.  But that would just be playing into their hands.  because their video is only five minutes long, yet they lie so much and so rapidly that it would take like an hour for me to go over it all in detail.  So instead of doing that, I'm just gonna run through them all quickly.  Here goes.  In Guatemala, you can register a business online.  It takes about 10 minutes and it costs about $20.  And 70% of employment in Guatemala is informal anyway, meaning that whatever business regulations there may be, the government is incapable of or unwilling to enforce them on the vast majority of the population.  So, most Guatemalans are actually subject to less government economic regulation than in the USA.  And yet Guatemala is still poor.  Also, in the last 50 years, Guatemala has only had a government that wasn't conservative and pro-small government for four of them.  For the other 46 years, they've all been conservative.  The only big government policies that they've supported are to maintain a large and powerful police force and military.  But considering PragerU's history, I'm really, really liking and advocating for those two things all the time, even though they're both funded and run by the government.  Oh, and also, while I'm editing this, they literally just uploaded another video with a thumbnail that says, Cops are the good guys.  So, yeah, I don't think that's what they mean by big government.  I could also point out that aside from Cuba and Nicaragua, Latin American governments over the last 50 or 60 years have been overwhelmingly right-wing, conservative, and supportive of free market capitalist policies.  The common image of them as especially left-wing is false.  Only comparatively few of them have had such a government in recent decades.  And most of them were mere momentary interruptions to like half a century or more of conservative rule.  And the countries that did have such governments were poor beforehand too.  Actually more so in most cases.  Guatemala is a particularly extreme example though.  It really can't be emphasized enough that they chose the absolute worst possible country to use as their case study.  All but one of its governments in recent history have been explicitly hostile towards so-called big government.  Pretty much all of them have even openly identified as anti-communist.  And back in the 80s, which is pretty recent history, this anti-communism was used to justify a genocide of the Mayan indigenous people.  Said genocide was carried out by a succession of right-wing military dictatorships that, surprise surprise, were supported by the US government.  They were also installed in the first place thanks to the help of the USA, as it kicked off that course of events by orchestrating a coup against the democratically elected leftist president, Jacobo Arbenz, in 1954.  Here's the most notorious of those dictators, Efrain R\u00edos Montt, having a good old time with US President Ronald Reagan in the White House.  At that meeting, Reagan said that R\u00edos Montt was getting a bomb rap and that he was totally committed to democracy in Guatemala.  He subsequently sent the CIA to Guatemala to support the military there with weapons and training.  Well, it turned out that Rios Montt actually murdered about 30,000 innocent civilians, and Reagan, an icon of small government conservatives, knew about it all along.  Haha, oops!  So if Guatemala is poor because of government policy, it wouldn't be because of big government giving out free stuff.  because there just hasn't been much of that.  it would be because of so-called small governments that implemented policies recommended by their pals in the prosperous USA while for most of that time also murdering anyone who disagreed.  and if its government is corrupt then well all that shows is that it's small conservative government is corrupt.  politicians in conservative governments can be corrupt Get out of town.  Not to mention that American politicians are sponsored by so many corporations that they could easily adorn their outfits with logos like a race car driver.  Legal corruption, baby.  There's also the fact that the American Republican Party, which PragerU loves, started a war on drugs.  which it then exported across Latin America by paying conservative governments across the region to enforce the policy.  This has wreaked havoc, especially in countries like Guatemala, which are smack bang in the middle of all of the most notorious drug trafficking routes.  By cracking down on the drug trade and demanding that other countries do so as well, the USA made drug prices skyrocket, and so the trade became far more lucrative than it had ever been before, leading to the creation of massive violent gangs competing for control of it.  Such violence is the direct cause of much of the migration from Central America to the USA.  It's gotten so bad that back in 2012, even one of Guatemala's conservative presidents couldn't help but acknowledge that the war on drugs was a failure.  And he even proposed that they be legalized to stop the violence.  We're talking about a conservative here.  Think about how bad it has to be for that to happen.  It's like hell freezing over.  And Gloria clearly knows about all of this because later in the video, She mocks the idea that Guatemala is poor because of imperialism. ",

            "text": "But if there's any country in Latin America that has been most negatively affected by US interventionism, that present-day woes could most reasonably be attributed to imperialism, Guatemala is definitely it.  And if I wanted to get really spicy, I could also point out that the US Democratic Party does not actually support big government.  Rather, they do pretty much everything they can to avoid implementing such policies, regardless of how popular they may be among their base.  I could have spent like 30 minutes exhaustively citing sources and telling you those things in much more detail, demonstrating far beyond any reasonable doubt that everything that the video claims is just factually wrong.  But the point of PragerU's video isn't actually to present anything remotely factual, so I'd just be wasting my time if I responded as if it was.  The stated audience of the video, immigrants to the USA, aren't even actually who the target audience is.  The Spanish version of the video, which should logically have more views than the English one if Latin American immigrants were actually watching this has more than 100 times fewer views.  The real message that it's trying to peddle is simple.  That if there is poverty, there must also have been big government, leftism, socialism, communism, etc.  Not even the other way around, that big government causes poverty.  That would at least make a little bit of sense because it would be proposing a cause and effect.  Instead, PragerU works backwards.  They see that Guatemala and much of Latin America and much of the world is poor.  Then, rather than examining the causes that led to the effect, which in the case of Guatemala does not exactly reflect very well on the kind of politics they peddle on their channel, they deflect by attributing it to the complete opposite cause.  Big government.  Something that it is simply not possible to reasonably claim that Guatemala has or has had any time in recent history.  They even pull an, um, what about Venezuela at one point? ",

            "text": "as if that cancels out the far more numerous conservative failures in the region including that of the very example that they chose to highlight.  because as basically every video on their channel asserts big government is bad and is definitely the cause of all bad things.  the government must stay out of everything always Except when it's doing stuff like denying women's rights, or having lots of unaccountable cops everywhere, and of course having a massive military that invades other countries as often as possible.  Those are good government things.  The only bad ones are the ones that are directed towards helping poor people.  The average immigrant is likely to know at least the bare minimum about their country's politics and history to be able to tell that this doesn't hold up.  They're especially unlikely to accept the ludicrous notion that Guatemala a country with an incredibly long history of conservative governance was ruined by socialist big government policies because they know firsthand that the free stuff that Pregui\u00fa claims their government offers them doesn't actually exist.  And they're all so smart enough to see that the Republican Party just openly hates them.  I mean, it's not exactly difficult.  How little credit does PragerU give them?  Its president openly threatens migrants like them with violent force and calls them criminals and rapists.  They're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime, they're rapists, and some, I assume, are good people.  That is a huge reason why 70% of them, an overwhelming number for any demographic, vote Democrat.  PragerU offhandedly acknowledges this for like five seconds in their video, and rather than even trying to contest it, they just try to justify it. ",

            "text": "Wait, so first they ask if you're scared that Republicans will deport you.  Then there's something that's completely off topic and out of place.  Then they just say, well, actually it's good and just if you're deported.  Gee, I wonder why they don't wanna vote for you.  They are not even trying.  They know they've got nothing, but they don't need to try because the average English speaking viewer who happens upon this video on YouTube is far less likely to know or care about those things.  They probably couldn't place Guatemala on a map.  So they might actually buy the idea that Guatemala and Latin America are poor because they've just been ravaged by terribly large communist governments.  That is the point of the video.  To convince people that poverty could not possibly have anything to do with PragerU's preferred policies.  To deflect the blame that clearly does lie squarely on them.  Reality does not reflect so favorably on them.  The vast majority of governments in Latin America over the last half a century or so have been very conservative and free market oriented.  And most still are today.  PragerU would absolutely 100% approve of them.  Yet despite that, most of the countries in the region are still poor.  And hell, how about we just take a look at the entire world then?  By the standards of the so-called first world, the vast majority of countries in the world are poor.  and the vast majority of them also have so-called small governments.  More than 60% of global employment and business is in the informal sector, which means that they aren't subject to any kind of government regulation or intervention at all.  No labor regulations, no safety regulations, no taxes, no nothing.  Most governments worldwide are actually so weak that they wouldn't be capable of enforcing such regulations even if they tried.  And yet people who work in these unregulated perfect free market capitalist conditions are far, far more likely to be poorer than those who have formal employment.  Does PragerU care about any of that?  Obviously not.  They don't even try to elaborate on any of their points.  They just make some broad, impactful sounding assertions without backing them up at all, and hope that you don't care enough to investigate them further, or know enough to question them.  Because they don't genuinely want people to prosper.  It doesn't matter to them that Guatemala is a poor country because of the very policies that they advocate for.  They want to maintain and expand the wealth of those who are already prospering, like their hosts and their billionaire donors.  Deflecting blame from the free market capitalist policies that most benefit themselves is absolutely crucial for that.  Big government, aka socialism, communism, whatever you want to call it, must account for its perceived failures.  And the far more numerous free market capitalist failures Well, they're socialism's fault too.  The less that you think about it, the better for them.  In Preguiu's world, wherever there is poverty, there must always be said to be big government.  Wherever or not there actually is.  That is the only possible explanation for poverty that they want you to believe exists.  Beyond personal failures, of course.  And you better not look into it, or you might just discover otherwise.  Wait, wait, hold on.  The video is not done yet.  While editing this, I realized that I let the presenter, Gloria Alvarez, off the hook way, way too much.  This is a woman from Guatemala, a country that endured a genocide in which 200,000 people were murdered, and countless more were forced to flee the country and endure other horrors.  They really, really liked to kill indigenous children and babies in particular, by the way.  There are countless eyewitness testimonies that go into gruesome detail.  And they did it for more than a decade, with the enthusiastic support of the USA and Israel for most of that time.  Both countries knew exactly what was going on, but clearly thought that it was a good and worthy pursuit, because they kept supporting it.  For this woman, who definitely knows all of this, to participate in a propaganda video that is the worst case of lying by omission that I have pretty much ever seen where none of this is even touched on for a word.  but she nonetheless does find the time to mock the idea that Guatemala has been negatively affected by foreign meddling.  the only way to describe it is criminal.  you probably won't be surprised to find that Gloria comes from a ridiculously rich family with connections to those same dictators Oh, and she openly and publicly denies the genocide and is an enthusiastic supporter of Rios Montt.
