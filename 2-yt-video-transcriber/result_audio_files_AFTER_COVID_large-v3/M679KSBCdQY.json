            "text": "When did you realize that you were different?  That you weren't like everyone else?  Were there certain instances?  Did you have dreams?  Did people treat you different when you were a kid?  That's nothing to be ashamed of.  Let me give you a couple examples of what I'm talking about.  I would walk through a mall with my mother and father, or just my mother, when I was a young boy.  And there was always maybe a mentally challenged person.  They used to say the word mentally retarded, although I don't think that's politically correct anymore, I think.  I remember when it went from mentally retarded to mentally challenged.  And then now there's even another word for it.  I'm not even sure what it is.  Down syndrome.  And even as a little boy, people would walk up to me.  Other people.  children who might have had Down syndrome would just come up and hold my hand.  And I would look up at my mother and then grasp their hand with my other hand and rub it, put my hand on their shoulder.  As a little boy, I did that.  And my mother noticed that people were drawn to me in that way.  But it wasn't just any old kid.  It was always someone who was needy, didn't have ego, elderly in wheelchairs would look at me, and I'd watch them look at me as I walked.  And I was self-conscious and I was thinking, why do people look at me like that?  Why is that?  I wasn't really sure if it was something I should be embarrassed about or self-conscious about.  When the neighborhood boys would say, hey, let's go play, there was a big parking lot across the street from my house.  I lived across the street from a big shopping center.  And when they were playing baseball, I would be looking for stuff in the woods, in the hedges, looking for things that people might have lost.  I stayed home and I read.  I had models, comic books, monster magazines.  I played alone a lot.  When everyone else went out, I played alone.  to the point where I remember when the movie Willard came out.  It was about a young boy.  Look it up.  It's even weird for me to say this, to even admit this.  It's about a boy who was a friend with rats.  Rats became his friend and he was breeding them and was fascinated by them.  And as a young man, somebody called me Willard.  Because I enjoyed being by myself.  And today I even enjoy being by myself.  I think that's one of the things that might have inspired the concept of relationship fasting.  Of being together for a window of time and then retreating and having your own time.  God, I would do horrible with a woman who needed to be around me 24-7.  That would be horrible.  That's a nightmare.  A clingy person?  Neat.  And of course, now that I'm being open to marriage, finding a woman who can coexist with me, but be my wife, that's hard.  That's hard for a woman.  It's not hard for me.  But I enjoyed being by myself.  I enjoyed that.  I liked sketching.  I liked... reading into a microphone.  as a young boy as young as eight years old reading into a microphone i took my father's reel to reel tape recorder and i would read into it and talk into it and play back my voice.  and i was so happy by myself.  so happy by myself i did not like.  being in high school did not being like in high school.  i played sports to try to fit in, that didn't work.  I went into, because team sports didn't work well for me.  And then I was into Cub Scouts and then Boy Scouts.  And I loved that because it was about merit.  The whole concept of meritocracy, merit badges.  It wasn't about teamwork, although I learned how to work with teams.  But I loved the merit of doing things, of being rewarded for something I did.  And I enjoyed that.  I had a girlfriend in my teenage years.  She wasn't like all the other girls.  And we reconnected about, I guess, about two years ago.  Her son found me.  And we've become friends again after 40 years.  40 years.  And she and I walked everywhere.  We walked.  I never knew anyone who walked as much as me and my girlfriend.  We talked about everything from philosophy to the meaning of life to science to literature.  Just everything you could possibly think of.  Music.  And she was very similar.  Wasn't a clingy girl.  And then I went to college.  and i had a roommate.  ah a roommate.  i want to live alone.  i don't want a dorm room with somebody but i had a roommate and that was okay.  we had fun.  and then after that i got a dorm room for the rest of my college years by myself because i enjoyed being by myself.  me and a turntable and headphones didn't play sports and i read a lot.  and then my library became my most valuable possession.  My library could fill the walls of a room, three walls of a room, like your normal sized bedroom, floor to ceiling with books.  And I categorized all my books like you would in a library.  It wasn't literally the Dewey Decimal System, but I categorized them.  I knew exactly where every book was.  if someone said, Do you have a book on such and such?  I'd say, oh, yes, I can find that.  And I would go right through.  Oh, here it is right here.  And I developed my own little private categorizing system.  And I read and I read and I read.  And I got more degrees and went to college and a thousand continuing ed hours after my master's degree.  I taught my first college course at 26 years old.  And I was probably teaching, I'm trying to think, by the time I was 30, I had taught in already three colleges as an adjunct professor.  By the time I was 35, five colleges.  And I started out just teaching one class.  It was fun.  And I became a therapist for many years and worked with a lot of people.  And the people that I worked best with were people who were the introspective, quiet, loner types like me.  I don't like categories like introvert, extrovert, but I have been noted as saying that I am an introvert with extroverted tendencies.  I'm super happy by myself.  Hence the Van Gogh room, pipe smoking.  When all the young single guys are out there dating women, I... You know, talking about spinning plates and having several girlfriends, I always thought, well, one plate would be this book or that book, a cigar and a glass of whiskey, a pipe and a cup of coffee.  If I had a date with a girl and she canceled out for some reason, I didn't get back on the phone and call another.  I said, oh, wow, I get to read my book tonight.  So I guess my message isn't for everybody.  It's for those that haven't always been popular.  I like to say that I'm a general in the army of average.  And that's who I work best with.  I still feel slightly intimidated by people who are excellent at, super excellent at what they do.  I've made money.  I've been married.  I have children.  I plan on living to 105.  Lord willing, that is.  I guess my message is not for the obviously successful, the popular person.  My message is for the person that felt like they didn't fit in, felt like that they were different, they knew they were different.  There was a self-awareness that they had that they were different.  And maybe for a short period of time you felt bad about it.  You don't have to feel bad about it.  You don't have to feel bad about that.  You don't have to try to force yourself like a square peg in a round hole.  Force yourself into the world of being popular and having friends and followers.  I can make a phone call and in three hours have my house filled with friends and have a party.  I used to do that all the time.  Men bring something to... No, I'd say men bring something to drink, women bring something to eat.  And 70 people would be at my house.  Loud music playing, having a good time.  And then there would always be a few people that hang out at the very unhealthy cleanup ever.  Pool parties, deck parties, house parties, that kind of thing.  I'm reminiscing right now, but what I'm trying to tell you is that if you're the kind of person that you feel you've been different, then you've landed in the right place.  There's no shame in being unpopular.  There's no shame in being a nerd.  There's no shame in being an antisocial or a social agoraphobic or anything like that.  It's all right.  I've come into my own and you can come into your own too.  And I've evolved and I'm evolving.  And I decided I'm going back into doing coaching, counseling, not therapy.  I'm not interested in people's pathology anymore.  Although if I feel that pathology is really a gift, I can help you develop that.  The attraction in life.  Are you stuck?  When I started this channel in 2016, I remember the first time I said, 2016 is the year that you get unstuck.  And then that went by.  And then I said, in my head, should I be telling them that 2017 is the year?  2017 came by and said, 2017 is the year that you get unstuck.  And a lot of people have been getting unstuck in the past almost five years now.  February will be five years.  A lot of success stories out there.  Some haters.  I guess that comes with the territory, doesn't it?  But I'm glad you're here.  And I hope you enjoyed my interviews.  I just thought I'd give you a little background of who I am, where I've come from.  And the Daybreak Show is coming back real soon.  I hope you enjoy it.  A new fresh attitude, new insights.  I feel refreshed, invigorated, and I can't wait to meet with you again early mornings.  I'll see you on the Daybreak Show real soon, your home of sanity, clarity, and reason. ",
