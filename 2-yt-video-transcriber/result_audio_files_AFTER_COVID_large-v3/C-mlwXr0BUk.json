            "text": "I have a theory.  Well, not a theory.  I have a suggestion.  Since the Biden campaign is not acknowledging the truth of these emails, the veracity of the emails, I think that Giuliani or whoever is in charge of these emails should simply say as follows.  Okay, we will keep releasing.  It's not our desire, but you have forced our hand.  We will keep releasing.  highly embarrassing photos of Hunter Biden until you finally acknowledge that there was no other way we could have gotten these photos except from verifiable data.  Okay?  Files.  How would anybody have photos of Hunter Biden in extremely compromising positions if it weren't his own computer.  Furthermore, just out of curiosity, I mean, he's obviously a troubled soul.  I have no desire to weigh into that.  My problem is with Joe Biden, not Hunter Biden.  Remember when he bragged about, oh yeah, so let me finish that point.  Even given his state, why would he put photographs of himself on a drug binge?  You know?  Well, look, I just say this as a warning to all of you.  Drugs kill, and drugs, if they don't kill the body, kill the mind.  That's why I hate marijuana.  I don't believe for a second that it is not a gateway drug.  Of course there are many people who stop at marijuana.  That has nothing to do with my point.  How many people started with marijuana?  How many people didn't start with marijuana and then took up harder drugs?  My view is whatever you take to alter your brain is wrong.  That's all.  I'm not against alcohol.  I don't think it alters the brain.  Of course, if you become an alcoholic, it does.  I don't drink, so I have no vested interest here.  Everybody always thinks I have a vested interest.  You're only saying that because, and then they fill in the blank.  All right.  So these... Emails show that, in fact, Joe Biden, as vice president, did meet with one of the heads of Burisma, the Ukrainian company, that paid his son $50,000 a month.  Was it a month or a week?  It was a month, right?  $50,000 a month to do nothing.  They paid him $50,000 a month for the same reason.  people paid Bill Clinton $500,000 to give a speech, to have access to Hillary Clinton.  The level of corruption in the Democratic hierarchy is so much greater than the level of corruption in the Republican hierarchy that it takes your breath away.  They're crooks.  Joe Biden is the biggest crook to run for office since Hillary Clinton.  In a good four years, there has not been a crook like Hillary Clinton of the Democratic ticket.  I won't speak of Kamala Harris, how she gathered political power in California.  Nobody talks about that.  Being the mistress of the Speaker of the House of California, the most powerful politician in California for many years, Willie Brown, while he was married.  It doesn't even come up.  Can you imagine if a man had done that?  The feminists are right.  We do have double standard, and it's a standard that works against men.  1A Prager 776.  So he boasted.  he got rid of the prosecutor.  Remember that famous one?  That son of a, and he used the word.  I gave them six hours to fire that prosecutor.  That was the prosecutor who was, in fact, now it turns out, going to prosecute Burisma.  and its ties to the biden vice presidency.  of course he wanted him fired you think?  uh vice president the united states travels around the world asking for prosecutors to being fired because he's on a noble quest of legality in in different countries.
