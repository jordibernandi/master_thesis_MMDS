Spreading your fear all over the place.  I'm saying we will, we will mock you.  We will, we will mock you.  Call me with a trust fund.  Dumb, dumb, crying in the street.  Gonna defund police someday.  You got cloth on your face.  It won't stop mace.  Watching you fail brings a smile to my face.  We will, we will mock you.  Me, me.  We will, we will mock you.  Biden, you're an old man, con man, pleading with the herd, sniffing hair and groping kids all day.  You got cloth on your face, sheltered in place.  Now you want Kamala because of her race.  We will, we will mock you.  The sheeple.  We will, we will mock you.  Everybody.  We will, we will mock you.  We will, we will mock you. ",
