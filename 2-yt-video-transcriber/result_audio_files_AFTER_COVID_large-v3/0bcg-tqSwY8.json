            "text": "Well guys this story took off yesterday on Twitter and to a lesser degree in the media.  Lawrence Fox appeared on Channel 5's The Jeremy Vine Show yesterday with Jasmine Aliba Brown or whatever her name is, who as you would expect showed herself up as usual by essentially going at Lawrence Fox from the start of the show.  They was joined on the show by Ian Dow from LBC but he said nothing important during this segment.  so we will focus on Fox vs Yasmin who as we all know cannot help herself being the rabid snarling spitting leftist we have all witnessed over the years.  We have literally seen it every year in relation to Brexit and it seems we will see it in the future since the BBC, Channel 5 and others like that will happily trot her out to spit bile at someone who might vote for a different party to.  Now Jeremy Vine brings up Laurence Fox calling Sainsbury's out on Twitter for their woke virtue signaling segregation policy which Laurence Fox explains is something everyone should call out.  that naturally sets off Yasmin the perpetually outraged twat.  She goes off on a right one and calls Laurence Fox a racist bully which let's be honest is ridiculous.  Fox is about as safe as they come.  He is an actor which should say it all.  really.  I'm sure most of you would agree the guy's about as spicy as the Teletubbies but Yasmin does not care about facts or reality.  let's be honest.  Now the second she calls him that he expertly takes her down a peg or ten by stating he will take her arse to court which I have to say is the way to beat these idiots.  If they call you something you can easily prove is wrong then take these shit weasels to the cleaners.  They have got away with it for far too long now cancelling people's lives with baseless accusations.  So let's take a look at the clip that Channel 5 tried to hide yesterday. ",

            "text": "now obviously i've had to cut most of the segment out because channel 5 will block the video no doubt since they deliberately failed to upload this episode on my five which is their on-demand website.  For some reason they did not want people watching it because they uploaded lots of other clips but failed to put this one up for some reason.  And to be honest I think we all know why.  But anyway like I said Lawrence Fox did well during the show dealing with her bile that let's be honest he probably expected from the start.  Now I do have to say I love how quick she is to retract it when he said he would take her to court.  Obviously, it did sound kind of childish to me, but I guess that is what you have to do in order to shut these snivelling shit weasels up.  And as a matter of fact, I think she deserves an award for shit weasel of the week with this performance.  If you're gonna talk this kind of shit on TV about someone, then at least have the guts to put your money where your mouth is, instead of capitulating like the French the moment opposition is put in front of you.  It shows to me she has no held beliefs you could actually pin down.  She just parrots attack lines that she heard on her Twitter echo chamber.  It's actually really pathetic and apparently Lawrence Fox doesn't plan to take her to court which I must say is a great shame.  The fact that she retracted it but refused to say it was a joke says to me that she actually meant it.  So he probably would have a leg to stand on though I'm not really a lawyer am I?  But at the end of the day it was great to see her capitulate like the snivelling shit weasel that she is. ",
