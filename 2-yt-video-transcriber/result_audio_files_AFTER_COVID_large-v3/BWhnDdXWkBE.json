This time it is Nisswa, Minnesota, Mayor Fred Heidman, who is being arrested for disorderly conduct and obstructing the legal process.  And if you haven't seen the video, the video is a doozy.  Now, just a little context before we watch the video.  Hydeman was intervening when the police were stopping a third party on the highway, so there are two separate video angles of the incident.  One is the body cam of the arresting officer, and the other was posted on the TikTok, presumably of the person in the car who the police officer stopped.  And there is some context to the timing of the video as well.  The body cam footage was from the first part of the incident before Haydn was asked to leave.  He apparently left and then returned in his vehicle, which is what the second part of the video, the TikTok angle, is from after he was asked to leave and came back.  Now let's watch the video of the incident in all its glory.  I am going to bleep out the swears in as much as possible because this is a family-friendly channel. ",

How does anyone think it's okay to talk like this, let alone an elected official to law enforcement?  And setting that aside, Haydn at the end says that he was never warned.

            "text": "Luckily, he got the dog back on a leash and the dog was not harmed, but my goodness, how silly do you have to be in life to do something like this?  Now, according to an article on the subject and a statement from Hydeman, his defense when he said that he wasn't warned is that he wasn't warned by the police officers the second time he came back.  From the West Central Tribune, body cam footage shows northern Minnesota mayor in expletive-filled rant against officers written by Jennifer Krause.  After refusing officers' warnings to move to a safer area, Heidman was arrested under probable cause for disorderly conduct and obstructing the legal process while officers were conducting a traffic stop near his business on Highway 371 and Skillman Street, south of Nisswa.  Police leaders respond.  Quote, this guy shows up to a traffic stop and he had nothing to do with it.  No part of it whatsoever, end quote.  Pico Lake's police chief, Eric Klang, said, quote, it was totally inappropriate.  If he's got a problem with the officers or with Nisswa, he should be dealing with that in a different setting than alongside a busy road where there is a traffic stop.  People are only seeing a part of this in TikTok, but there's a whole lot more to it.  He was given numerous warnings and he just wanted to be out there and be belligerent with the officers and we are not going to put up with  that.\".  Nisswa Police Chief Craig Taylor said, quote, I'm disappointed and extremely sad that an elected official feels justified in inserting himself into a traffic stop that has nothing to do with him and feels it is appropriate to yell and swear at two officers from two jurisdictions that are doing nothing more than trying to do their jobs and making people safe.  Quote, I would hope there be more accountability to our elected officials.  End quote.  And just to give the context of the stop itself, apparently it was initiated for violation of window tint laws and muffler noise laws, and when they stopped the individuals in the car, they found some Mary Jane and some Mary Jane paraphernalia.  Quote, the officers had no issues with the occupants in the vehicle or with searching the vehicle, end quote, Quang said.  Quote, and then they saw a guy with a dog walking up the service drive and crossed the southbound lane of the highway, going through the median and holding a phone, filming it.  Then he started yelling vulgarities at the officers, end quote.  Heidemann himself later released a statement in which he said the following, When he disagreed that he was asked to leave five times, that happened in about 30 seconds when he was there the first time, not when he came back after the people were about to leave.  So Heidman's defense to having been asked five times to leave by the police officers is that he was asked to leave five times the first time he was there before he left and came back the second time.  But what of these charges of disorderly conduct and obstructing the legal process, do they fit what we saw in that video?  Let's go read them, shall we?  2019 Minnesota Statutes, 609.72, disorderly conduct, subdivision one.  CRIME 2.  Disturbs an assembly or meeting not unlawful in its character, or.  3.  Engages in offensive, obscene, abusive, boisterous, or noisy conduct, or in offensive, obscene, or abusive language, tending reasonably to arouse alarm, anger, or resentment in others.  Ding ding ding ding!  I think we have a winner here.  And an interesting final paragraph in that it's an exception to the first three paragraphs, and I say it's interesting because you know it's only in the law because it actually came up in life.  A person does not violate this section if the person's disorderly conduct was caused by an epileptic seizure.  I would go the other way around on this and say that if it was caused by an epileptic seizure, I would not call it disorderly conduct in the first place.  But now let's move on to the second charge, obstructing the legal process.  609.50.  Obstructing legal process, arrest, or firefighting.  Subdivision 1.  Crime.  Whoever intentionally does any of the following may be sentenced as provided in Subdivision 2.  1.  Obstructs, hinders, or prevents the lawful execution of any legal process, civil or criminal, or apprehension of another on a charge or conviction of a criminal offense.  2.  Obstructs, resists, or interferes with a peace officer while the officer is engaged in the performance of official duties.  3.  Interferes with or obstructs a firefighter while the firefighter is engaged in the performance of official duties.  4.  Interferes with or obstructs a member of an ambulance service personnel crew as defined in section whatever.  The rest of it is not relevant.  It is the first two that are relevant to this particular case.  2.  Penalty.  A person convicted of violating Subdivision 1 may be sentenced as follows.  1.  If the person knew or had reason to know that the act created a risk of death, substantial bodily harm, or serious property damage, or 2.  The act caused death, substantial bodily harm, or serious property damage, to imprisonment of not more than five years, or to payment of a fine, of not more than $10,000 or both.  Two, if the act was accompanied by force or violence or the threat thereof and is not otherwise covered by clause one, to imprisonment for not more than one year or to payment of a fine of not more than $3,000 or both, or in other cases, presumably this case, to imprisonment for not more than 90 days or to a payment of a fine of not more than $1,000 or both.  Now, the second charge is an interesting one, because it is obstructing the legal process, and you know the defense is going to be that the legal process was over by the time this guy was arrested, therefore he could not have been obstructing it.  It'll be an interesting argument.  I don't know when the legal process of pulling someone over is over.  I presume it's when the car has driven off, which would not be the case now, because the second footage, the TikTok footage, was in the car, so obviously the people had not yet driven off.  Was the legal process over such that it could no longer be obstructed?  We will see, but one thing is for certain.  It is about time that everybody be held to the same standard of the application of the law.  We will see where this goes.  If and when there are any developments in it, I will certainly do a follow-up vlog on it.
