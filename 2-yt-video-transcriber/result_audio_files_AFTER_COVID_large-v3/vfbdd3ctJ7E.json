            "text": "Hey everybody, this is Pastor Dana Coverstone, and you're watching this video starting out on a new YouTube channel today.  And if you would have told me three months ago I'd have my own YouTube channel and have millions of views on dreams and things, I would have said that you were as crazy as I would have thought that was at the time.  My life has changed a whole lot in the last three months.  A lot of fake accounts, a lot of fraud, a lot of crazy things going on, which is why we're here today, which is why the videos from now on are going to be branded and also copywritten, because people are taking them and using them in some unscrupulous ways and making money off of them.  That was never my intention.  My intention was, as a pastor, I had a dream, and it stirred me deep in my spirit to wake the church up, to realize that he's coming back.  This is not to cause debate or challenges to anybody's theological position.  This is not to cause arguments about the rapture or the second coming.  This is to wake the body of Christ up because all through church history, there have been times when the body of Christ, the church, was not where it needed to be.  And the dream I'm going to share today in this first video on here has to do a whole lot with that.  So let me just share it.  Saturday, September 26, I had a dream where I saw a huge field that was about, it was flat, it was open, and on either side, right and left, it stayed flat for about a mile, but at the end of that mile, it elevated up to a small hill on each side.  So basically, you had a flat area and a hill here and a hill here.  In the middle of that ground was a silver line.  It actually was a glimmering silver line about five feet wide, and it divided the entire flat area that I was watching for.  The sky had no clouds.  The sun was out.  I did not see the sun, but it was obvious from where the sun was.  It was at a high noon, high above us, and there was a lot of heat.  You could see, like when you're looking down a road and it's hot, you can see the glimmering, things like that.  It was very, very hot.  And on either side of that line that was glimmering like silver, it was a silver color, it was glimmering like silver, I saw a large number of people resembling what appeared to be armies.  And on the left side, to my left, was a very, very dark and demonic army with red horses, weapons.  heavily armored, obviously very ready and prepared for war that they were about to be involved with.  And they had horses, and those horses grunted, and they pranced, they pawed at the ground, they were anticipating some type of battle.  And the handlers of those horses, they were stroking their necks to calm them down, they were sitting on the horses, they were not holding them, they were sitting on the horses, ready to go to war, ready to do something with intention.  They were very confident as they prepared to fight.  And the other side, though, was a much smaller army, both in stature and in number.  They appeared to be mesmerized by the army on the left, almost like they were unbelieving in their sense of what they were seeing.  They could not believe what they were seeing.  They were awed by it.  They were not necessarily afraid, but they were so awed by what they saw, they could not move, and they just stared.  almost in a dead stare.  Now, some of these people had some armor, but it was shoddy.  It was broken.  There were swords that were split.  There were shields that were broken.  So they were this ragtag group of people who were very, very unprepared, especially if they were fighting the group that was on the left side.  They seemed very, very disorganized.  And most of all, they were very, very ill-prepared at what they were about to face.  And suddenly, from down the hill behind the smaller army, there were ten horses and riders.  White horses, the riders had large swords, had very, very good armor, flowing capes.  Even the horses were armored up.  And they ride down behind this smaller army.  And they come up right behind the people, the smaller army.  And they begin to go around and they begin to yell out strategies.  Here's what we're going to do.  We need you guys to go on this side.  We need to flank them on the left.  We need you to be ready and prepared.  We need to be watching.  One group was told to kind of stand just on the other side of the line and make sure that nobody got past them.  as far as the horsemen.  So the leader stated clearly that it was time to engage, and that every single one of them was needed for a fight.  And this leader wasn't just begging.  He was saying, here is the way it is.  Here's what's going on.  Here is life.  We have got to fight this battle.  You've got to go with us.  Get ready.  We're going to lead the way, and you follow right behind.  And so the horsemen went up and down in front.  They were laying out that strategy.  They said every single one was ready for the fight.  And finally, the horses got right next to the line, very close to the line.  They turned around.  They said, let's go.  The leader yelled, charge, and they went flying across this line, but only the horsemen and its riders crossed the line.  The armies began to clash swords and fight.  It was very, very close hand-to-hand combat.  The men were on their horses, and they just kept fighting.  I saw and heard the clanging of armor and swords, the battle, the clinking and the clanging.  You saw swords dropping, not from the men's hands, but you saw the fight.  This was a very, very, a lot of action, a lot of excitement was going on.  But I could also see there was concern on the leaders' eyes because they kept looking back to see where everybody else was from the army.  They kept looking back and they kept asking them to come and fight them.  Come, come on guys, come on, come on.  Join us, we can push them back, we need you.  Come on, come on, come on.  Those sort of comments.  And nobody showed up.  Nobody else came near that line.  They got close to it and they just kept watching.  They were mesmerized, they were awed by it, but nobody crossed the line.  And finally, some of those in that smaller army began running back.  They were walking backwards so they could keep watch of what was coming.  They were walking backwards, and they went up that hill, almost to the top of the hill, and they sat down, and they began watching from the top of the hill the battle that was taking place.  The ten riders and the horses, they were still victorious.  They were fighting.  They were clashing.  You could tell they were tired.  They were being worn down, but they just kept engaged.  They would not disengage from the battle.  They would not come back and cross that line.  But the people sitting on the hill just sat down and watched.  They only watched the battle.  They paid no attention to what was going on around them, none of the surroundings at all.  Suddenly, on the hill behind the ones who had retreated, there were a group of about 20 of the darker forces that were coming up behind them, sneaking up on them very, very carefully.  No horses.  They were just sitting low to the ground, sneaking up craftily.  And the people watching the battle had no idea they were even coming.  These evil people had, they were brandishing swords and battle axes, large clubs, and they were closing in.  As they got within a few feet of them, they attacked and literally beheaded five of them.  Five of these people who were sitting back there were beheaded before they even knew what was happening.  And then they begin to stir, begin to realize they're being chased, and they start running down towards the army, even though the enemy is behind them and in front of them.  These people started to yell towards the others, tried to warn them, hey, the enemy's coming behind, the enemy's coming behind.  Once again, they had no armor, they had no swords, they had no way to defend themselves.  The field is open, it's empty, there's nothing else there except this broad, wide-open sky.  And now, they either cross the line of battle or they get killed where they are, but they're running towards that line, they're running towards others.  The people that were next to the line were only watching the battle ahead.  A few turned around, heard what was going on, and became aware that they began to squint their eyes and look, and they realized something was wrong, but they still would not cross the line.  They would not even cross the line where the warriors were to get close to that situation.  So these folks were easily killed.  They were basically killed where they stood.  They would not engage because they had no weapons.  They simply cowered down and died right there on the field.  Some had tried to run around the army, but pretty soon more flanked on each side and they found themselves surrounded.  All of the battle was going on on the other side of the line.  Part of the dark army that flanked them basically took out the retreating army and the army that had not crossed the line.  Ten riders were still fighting, and they were successful.  They were winning.  And yes, there was blood, and yes, there was damage, but these guys kept fighting like they were determined.  They knew they had engaged, and they were not going to back away.  They were not going to stop.  And the enemy was pushed back.  Even as the enemy was pushed back, what I was seeing was from the top of the hill on the side of the line where the smaller army had been, it was littered, literally littered with dead corpses that people who had been killed, people who had been beheaded, people who had been ran through, viciously killed, all because they would not engage and didn't have the equipment, didn't have the armor, didn't have the swords.  They were in a place they should never have been to begin with when they weren't ready.  Some of those folks never crossed the line.  They never stepped across it.  Leaders on the horses kept fighting as if they had prepared and anticipated this battle while the rest of those stood on the side were dead, out of commission, assembling on the ground near death.  And what stood out to me was that only a few were pushing the enemy back for the good side, but also just a few of the evil ones took out the many because they weren't ready.  I mean the interpretation I think for this dream is pretty obvious.  it only requires a little bit of common sense to make you see that you better stay prepared.  that silver line that silver line was a line that you've got to cross and the two few have not too many have not crossed because they've not been ready they've not been praying they've not been seeking God's face.  and there have been warnings not just for me and dreams but they've been warnings from prophets and pastors and teachers for decades and centuries even from the prophets to get ready for the things that were coming.  that silver line was a very refined and purified line that requires a life committed and to surrender to Jesus to cross.  We need the spiritual maturity and the experience in warfare.  And if we have those things, we can win.  And God's trying to warn the church and wake the church up to say these things are coming.  But there is coming and will be a day when if you're not ready, there's nothing you will be able to do ever again to prepare for the things that we're facing.  There's a line and there's a time that will determine whether we're ready or not.  And once that time begins, it's going to be too late.  Too late to prepare and too late to make a difference.  We've been warned to get ready, and if we're not, we pay the price.  And, yeah, there will be a price we pay for being ready.  There will be opposition.  There will be persecution.  There will be challenges and attacks on our faith and on who we are as believers.  But those that are ready will simply be ready, and that's what's going to matter the most.  So those of you that are here in this dream, I'm going to challenge you to do your best to make sure you are ready and you stay ready.  This is not the time to lag back in your faith.  This is not the time to take a spiritual vacation.  This is not the time to ditch the church.  This is not a time to stop reading and praying.  This is not a time to let go of the spiritual disciplines.  Because these things are going to be required for us to have the victories and face the things that we're going to face in the future.  And they're coming.  not just because others are having dreams or I'm having dreams or whoever's having dreams, but because the Word of God tells us that many trials and tribulations will enter the kingdom of heaven.  So church, if you're not awake, you don't have much time.  Stay awake, stay ready, and engage in the battle because that's what God requires of us to do.  Thanks for listening. ",
