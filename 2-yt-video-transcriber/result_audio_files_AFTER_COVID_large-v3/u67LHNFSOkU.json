            "text": "Good afternoon people, WatchWomen65, Lisa Boyce here.  People are constantly commenting and wanting to get into arguments with me about the pre-tribulation rapture and they want to get into arguments with me about salvation.  They keep saying there's more to it than just believing.  Folks, let me explain something to you.  Paul told the Galatian church, that if anyone comes to you and preaches any other gospel other than what we've preached to you, let them be accursed.  He was so eminent about it, he said it twice.  Let them be accursed.  Ladies and gentlemen, the gospel.  1 Corinthians 15, 1 through 4.  Christ died for our past, present, and future sins.  was buried and rose again on the third day.  You don't have much time.  I don't know who I'm talking to, but there is not much time.  You better start believing right now in what he did for you at the cross.  Because the tribulation is coming.  Sudden destruction is about to happen.  I don't know when.  I don't know how.  But it is about to happen.  John 3.16 says that those who believe, and there is other verses of scripture that talks about believing.  But that one is my favorite.  There is plenty of verses that talk about believing.  But John 3.16 says that whosoever believe in me shall not perish but have eternal life.  The key word is believing.  No, you will not lose your salvation.  People want to tell me also, if you willingly sin, after you got saved, you will lose your salvation.  No, you will not.  People, we sin every day.  We wake up sinning.  If you're breathing, you can sin.  But as long as you have a heart that believes in the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, your salvation is not going anywhere.  It's a gift.  According to Ephesians 2, 8-9, it is a gift.  No, we will not lose our salvation.  You can come at me and argue with me and call me every name in the book.  You can make videos about me and call me every dirty name.  I stand on the word of God.  We will not lose our salvation once we are truly saved and once we truly believe in the death, burial, and resurrection.  There you have it.  Salvation 101 is simple.  Those who truly believe, and I'm going to say this, when you do sin, you're going to know it.  You're going to know it because it's going to be repulsive to you.  And it might even make you sick on the stomach.  That's a good thing because you know where you stand.  That's the salvation message.  You don't come to him saying what you can and will do.  You don't come to him saying what you've done because you can't do anything.  You come to him believing in what he's already taken care of at the cross.  Praise God.  I'm going to give you this.  This came a few minutes ago.  Prominent rabbi breaks silence.  This came off of Israel 365.  Prominent rabbi breaks silence.  Messiah is coming this year.  His name is, and don't get mad because I butcher names, especially Jewish names.  I butcher them bad.  Rabbi Shalom Arush.  That's his name.  He said there have been 5,700 holidays of Rosh Hashanah since the creation of the world.  But if a prominent rabbi's prediction proves true in just a few short weeks, Rosh Hashanah number 571 will be quite special.  Now don't forget, their Messiah is the Antichrist.  We look for Christ, the only Messiah, the true Messiah.  It says here, Rabbi Shalom Arush, an Israeli Bershlov rabbi and founder of the Shute Shiel Shast institutions made an entirely uncharacteristic announcement.  He said on September 18th, Jews will be celebrating the last new year, excuse me, without the Messiah.  He says, I'm going to tell you with certainty that Hashem, God, literally the name of God, what they call him, will help us meet together after Rosh Hashanah.  The rabbi said in an interview last week, and remember what I'm telling you, that this Rosh Hashanah will be the last one without Mashiach, Messiah, their Messiah.  And it could very well be that on this Rosh Hashanah, the Messiah will be revealed.  Now that's what's in here.  That's what's in here.  It says, the rabbi then discussed the tradition of Braslav, I can't pronounce this, to travel to the burial site of Rabbi Nashman in Yumen, Ukraine, on Rosh Hashanah.  Last year, more than 30,000 Jews arrived in the city of Yumen for the holiday.  I don't know how they're going to do it now with the pandemic, so... Due to the pandemic travel restrictions, both the Israeli and Ukrainian governments have issued statements saying that they will forbid anyone from traveling between the two countries.  Ukrainian Interior Minister Arslan Avakov said that the mass gathering could create large spikes in COVID-19 infections, spreading among pilgrims as well as local populations.  The rabbis insisted that this year would be unprecedented.  He says, I know that in heaven they are going to ask me about every word I'm saying now.  He said, I cannot say, I cannot just say things without meaning them.  This year people are going to get great gifts.  He says, I'm telling everyone, don't miss out on this.  Make the effort.  There is nothing to be afraid of.  Our sages have told us that emissaries sent to do the Torah commandment are never harmed.  Not on the way, not when they are performing the mitzvah, and not on their way home.  And this is even for small mitzvah.  for a small miss.  The rabbi again praised those who traveled from Yumen for Rosh Hashanah.  I'm gonna link this in the description box.  This is huge, actually.  This is big.  So I'm gonna link this in the description box.  Now we don't know what's gonna happen.  And I'm not putting a date on it.  I'm just going by what this article says.  We look for, like I said, we look for our Messiah, the true Messiah, Jesus Christ, and him only.  He's the only one who can save.  But I thought this would be very interesting and something to consider.  We don't know, but we know something's coming.  So I will link this in the description box.  I'll be back if anything else comes up.  Thank you. ",
