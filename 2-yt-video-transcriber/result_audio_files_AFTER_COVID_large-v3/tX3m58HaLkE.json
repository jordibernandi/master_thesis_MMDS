            "text": "The fourth round of Brexit trade negotiations have just finished and Michel Barnier and the European Union aren't too happy.  This is all thanks to Boris Johnson's chief negotiator David Frost because he's been very strong and stable in these trade talks.  and Michel Barnier came out yesterday to make a statement And he was very close to crying.  He was that frustrated because he's, as you know, we've said a couple of weeks ago, he gave up on the fisheries demand.  So he said, OK, this is not happening.  Obviously, UK are not going to give access, free access to British waters.  He went back to the European countries, France and Netherlands told him off.  They said, no, this isn't happening.  You have to get access.  So he's come back again.  We're going to show you the statement and it's quite sad to watch.  Michel has been working very hard.  But before we start, yesterday there was a bit of drama in the comment section of my video.  Because I accidentally, when I was talking about Barry Gardner, I accidentally said Tory MP, I meant Labour MP.  A lot of people kicked off.  People make mistakes.  I'm not Piers Morgan, I'm not perfect.  So, let's start with what's been happening because We know the end of this month, end of June, is the deadline when both sides have to decide if they want to extend the transition or not.  And Andrew Bridgen, the actual Tory MP, came out and said that everything is actually down to the next few weeks.  And the moment the EU realises on the 1st of July that there's no extension, then that's when they're going to show all their cards.  So let's watch Andrew Bridgen to see what he had to say.  We're moving to towards the deadline of the 1st of July, which is the last date an extension could be asked for.  I think once we've passed that, the EU will realise that we are leaving on the 31st of December, the transition period, and we're offering them tariff and quota free trade as we've got at the moment.  But I don't think we're going to get any sense from the EU until all hope is extinguished that we're going to ask for an extension.  Yes, he's absolutely right and he's not the only one who's saying these sort of things.  You have Douglas Carswell who was the co-founder of the Vote Leave campaign.  He's also come out and he's spoken to the Express about what's happening and he said that I think the government's position is absolutely right.  We're not going to allow ourselves to be forced into the EU's regulatory orbit.  He is mentioning that Michel Barnier's behaviour might create a lot of tensions when it comes to the the English channel between France and the UK, and he said that now it's really up to the EU as to how they want to respond to that.  If they want to respond to that by imposing tariffs, it's on them.  I think the EU's opening position shows that Barnier has not really even yet understood what Brexit means.  Brexit means we make our own rules, we make our own laws and we make our own mistakes and take responsibility for those mistakes.  This is what Michel Barnier doesn't understand.  And even if he does, the rest of the European countries like Macron and everybody else, they don't get this.  There's no surprise that Michel Barnier himself has conceded a defeat from his side, from his team.  He has admitted that the European Union must offer concessions to the UK if they want a Brexit trade deal.  So he's trying to say this to all these European, the EU 27 countries, they're just not listening.  And the pressure on the UK government to request an extension, that's also not really working.  Jacob Rees-Mogg in Parliament made this statement which is absolutely brilliant. ",

But putting aside all the jokes and all the banter that's happening in the House of Commons, and especially between the two negotiating teams, there is a problem because, as we said, Yesterday, Michel Barnier came and made a statement.  And I'm going to show you three clips from that because these are the three main points.  He's talking about the fisheries.  He's talking about the level playing field and the political declaration.  I have a lot to say about that.  So let's start with the fisheries to see what Michel had to say. ",

            "text": "And my responsibility is to speak the truth.  And to tell the truth, this week there have been no significant areas of progress, starting with fishing.  On fisheries, the UK have not shown any true will to explore other approaches beyond zonal attachment for the sharing of quotas.  They continue to condition access to waters to an annual negotiation, which is not possible for us, not even technically possible.  The EU wants... to construct a stable economic partnership.  That's always been our desire.  Next point, level playing field. ",

But he has to make that statement, which is a problem with bureaucracy.  He doesn't have a say himself.  He just has to go with what the commission tells him.  But everything he said is absolute nonsense because he is now objecting to the UK as a country to set its own rules when it comes to fisheries.  Well, we're going to be an independent, sovereign country.  Of course we're going to do it ourselves.  And the second point is level playing field.  This is absolutely fascinating. ",

And it's all about fair trade and fair play.  I really despise any word when you add the word fair in front of it.  Fair trade is not a good idea, fair play is not a good idea in that sense, because they just sound nice, but in reality it's not free trade, it's not free transactions.  They say in order to make it easier to trade between the UK and the EU, you have to essentially be protectionist, which means we can't really trade with the rest of the world freely.  And this is nonsense.  Now, the next bit, he's talking about everything else, the cooperation.  And at the end, he moans about the political declaration and how the UK is not going with what they promised, apparently. ",

But there are still some important questions open as to how all that would be reflected.  in the agreement itself.  So, ladies and gentlemen, on these points, as on other points, all we're asking for is for the political declaration to be respected and complied with. ",

One was the withdrawal agreement, which was legally binding, it was part of legislation and everything, and Then you had the political declaration, which wasn't as legally binding, and it was simply to outline what both sides want to do in the future relationship and how they want to have their objectives for the trade negotiations.  The whole point was that the political declaration wasn't as legally binding, so it's flexible.  And I did say at the time when this was happening, a lot of the Brexiteers were complaining, saying, oh, this isn't Brexit.  Look at the political declaration, all these promises.  And I did say, don't worry, guys.  The whole point is that you could make changes in the future.  And that's what David Frost is doing.  That's what Boris Johnson is doing.  And Michel Barnier is complaining, saying you're not going with the political declaration.  Yeah, that was the whole point.  That was the trick.  If you were really worried about that, then you could have made the political declaration legally binding.  Obviously, we wouldn't have signed it.  So this guy is now having a meltdown over the political declaration, which is absolutely hilarious.  Watch this. ",
