You betrayed us, but I know many people feel as though it is a betrayal, but it is more like a setup because you never had our back in the first place.  You are simply controlled opposition.  Now, if everything was so desperate and hopeless for Trump and his supporters, then why the constant propaganda?  Wire, if you are not so confident, would you say, yes, let's do recounts?  Let's do it, no problem.  There are cases of fraud being reported, so let's just do the investigation because you are fucking scared.

We know that our country, our freedom, and our future is at stake if we do not put up a fight now against the liberals.  Because if the liberals can get away with this cheating right now, they know they can get away with anything from now on.  And you are a foolish turd.  if you're going to sit there and think... Well, we'll just have to do better the next election.  Are you that dumb?  Are you that dumb?  Give me a break.  If our votes didn't matter in this election, they could cheat and get away with it.  What makes you think your vote's going to matter in future elections?  Oh, and by the way, some of you other dumb patriots on here that are posting... Well, there's just really not enough evidence to suggest that the liberals were cheating.  Well, you know what you can go do?  You can go write stupid on your forehead, go put on your little stupid Biden hat, and go march over on the stupid left side.  We don't need your turdism attitude on our side because you are weak, and we do not need any weak patriots on our side.  So, cheers, patriots.  Hold the line and continue to fight.  I came up on my crossroad yesterday.  I met her on a ship just west of Apple Bay.  We ate fish and we listened to some old time rock and roll.
