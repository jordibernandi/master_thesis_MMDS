            "text": "The Leon Valley, Texas City Council is breaking its own law to hold an in-person city council meeting at City Hall.  Why are they risking the safety of city officials and city staff instead of meeting remotely?  Keep watching to find out.  It could be happening because of you and me.  Joe Slavagio's political establishment in Leon Valley is at it again.  First they took out Jack Miller for filing a complaint against the city.  Then they took out the First Amendment auditors and even those witnessing the First Amendment auditors.  Then they booted City Councilman Benny Martinez.  Martinez was critical of Slavagio's administration and was standing up to the tyranny.  And now the tyrants are coming after Leon Valley Mayor Chris Riley.  Councilwoman Donna Charles filed numerous ethics complaints against Mayor Riley in September.  All of those allegations quickly died, but Councilwoman Charles kept filing additional complaints.  Last month, the Ethics Board claimed that Mayor Riley violated the city charter when she released billing statements for attorney Ryan Henry's involvement in the Benny Martinez removal.  City Manager Kelly Kunstler's hand-picked attorney, Ryan Henry, racked up tens of thousands of dollars of charges, well over $100,000, and that's just in 2019 alone.  Outrageous.  In Texas, bills for attorney fees are public information subject to required public disclosure.  And just a month before the mayor's alleged violations, the city released all of these very similar, just the months before, invoices for Ryan Henry.  Let me show you just how much.  Well, that's pretty scary once that comes into focus, and this is just part of it.  These invoices, which are released by the city administration with no redactions, contain the same categories of information they now claim as privileged.  The mayor did the exact same thing.  It was okay when the city administration did it, but now, all of a sudden, it's not.  And even if it did contain privileged communications, it would be the attorney's fault for including that in a billing statement that is subject to required public disclosure that contained no title, disclaimer, anything like that.  that would lead someone to believe that there might be privileged information within.  This is a manufactured issue.  I've even requested attorney bills from Leon Valley.  No redactions.  Same stuff.  No redactions.  But when one of Slovaggio's political opponents releases it, they have to be kicked out.  Public information is released by city officials and city staff on a routine daily basis.  The mayor said that she didn't know that it contained any privileged information. ",

            "text": "My argument is that no specific attorney legal advice is contained within the alleged privilege communication.  No confidential information as defined in Section 552.101 is contained in the alleged communication.  Again, confidential is privacy.  City Council, as a governing body, solely holds and is entitled to the attorney-client privilege, and that's the Home Rule Charter Section 3.09E.  Again, there was no mark, redaction, or stamp on the billing statements or email that asserted any part of the bills that were privileged or confidential.  That's C3 through C5 that you've seen this evening.  The city council has not asserted attorney-client privilege as to any part of the bill submitted.  And what's interesting is, and again, I wouldn't have released it if I saw redactions, and I want to make sure everybody understands what redaction is.  Redaction is where you black out sections of the bill so that you can't see what was said or what was billed for.  And on March the 15th, ",
