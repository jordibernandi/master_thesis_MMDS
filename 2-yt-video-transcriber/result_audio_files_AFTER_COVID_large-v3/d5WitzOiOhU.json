            "text": "Hey there, Generation Butthurt, it's the maskless man you just love to hate.  So I just seen on Fox News that my president, and still your president by the way, Donald J. Trump wants to be on Mount Rushmore, and I think that's a fantastic idea.  It's about time we got some new blood up in there.  It'd be like when Brian Johnson joined ACDC or when Axl Rose... joined acd.  pretty much anybody but angus young joining acdc.  but i digest i mean who could it be?  not barack hussein obama not shillery's husband.  you know nixon would check out halfway through construction hell.  i bet jimmy carter would carve the damn thing himself if they let poor people live in it.  but i don't think so.  it's got to be trump.  He's done so much for us.  He's united Americans all over the world, from the whitest white to the darkest white.  And can you imagine pulling up to whatever state Mount Rushmore's in and looking up and seeing those four pale presidents and one that looks like he eats Cheetos face first?  It would just make you proud.  And you wouldn't even have to Cut into the rocks anymore with the technology we got.  we got filters both snapchat and deep fake.  you put trump wherever you want.  I don't even know who you replace?  Probably lincoln since he's the farthest right on the mountain, but you put trump wherever you want all year long hell.  give honest abe.  some Neck bolts for halloween.  make teddy roosevelt look like an actual teddy for valentine's day.  I don't give a damn to all you people Boo-hooing and crying saying we shouldn't be on your land.  Well, if you Native Americans don't like it, you can go back to where you came from.  So today, I'm going to raise my emotional support beer to my president, Donald J. Trump.  Put him on Mount Rushmore now.  And for nothing else, to scare away the wildlife.  Now get off my property.
