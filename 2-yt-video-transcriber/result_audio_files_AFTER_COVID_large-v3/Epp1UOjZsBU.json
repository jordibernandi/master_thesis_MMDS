            "text": "Shalom, everyone, this is Amir Tsarfati, and I'm here live from Galilee, from Israel.  It is a few hours before the Sabbath enters Shabbat here.  And I just wanted to share with you a few thoughts that were, I believe, given to me by the Lord throughout the last few weeks and mostly days as I've been watching what is going on.  in America, what is going on in Europe, what is going on in Israel, what is going on really all around the world.  So we're watching truth being suppressed.  We're watching truth being called conspiracy.  We're watching threats being made.  We're watching censorship being enforced.  We're watching something that we thought we would never live to see.  You know, we are the generation that used to teach Bible prophecy, for the most part, as future events, things that are definitely going to come in the future.  Yet we never really took part of major epic things such as what we go through in the year 2020.  Now I realize that we have a clash of civilizations here.  It's not the West versus the East.  It's not the North versus the South.  It's not even Democrats and Republicans.  It's not even Jews or Gentiles.  We clearly see a spiritual battle.  that I believe is in the heavenlies right now but is reflecting here on earth.  I want you to know that only when we look at the Word of God and we believe in the Word of God and we see and understand what are the things to come, we are able to process the things that are happening right now throughout this year.  but also, of course, in the last few weeks and days.  I want to encourage you.  The Bible says that we are the light of the world.  The Bible says that we are the light because we have received the One who is the light of the world into our hearts.  And now we are His ambassadors.  Now it is not only us, it is Him.  He lives in us.  And He that is in us is greater than he that is in this world.  We're talking about people who can see what is going on.  But then we're talking about people who cannot see what is going on.  But on the other end of all of this, there are other people who can see what is going on.  But these people have been enlightened by someone else whom they believe is the source of light.  And what am I trying to say?  We're watching right now an interesting battle orchestrated by the world elites.  These are multi-billionaires.  And they don't need more money.  They're not doing that for money.  You need to understand that.  Believers in Jesus don't preach the gospel or make disciples for money.  They really truly want people to get saved.  But what you need to understand is on the other end, it's the same people who now claim to have seen other light.  Remember the one who pretends to be an angel of light?  And they... for the longest time are trying to convince the world that their light is the one, the true one, and that their ways are the true ways.  Now you have to understand.  in between the people of God and those that are operated and influenced and orchestrated by Satan, in between them there stands hundreds of millions of people that are confused.  Now you must understand those multi-billionaires, they are using powerful politicians.  Those are using the media.  And they are brainwashing the people.  So we are watching for the first time, I don't think in the history there has ever been a time When the effort of the satanic globalists aligned with the efforts of their minions, the politicians and the deep state, aligning also with the effort of the media and the social media to the point that it aligns with the mindset of most of the people.  This is where we are in a history right now.  We've never seen that before in the history, this alignment.  This alignment allows... those globalists, those Satanists, those Luciferians to finally, from the very top all the way down, introduce the new world order.  You have to understand that they think that those hundreds of millions of simple people are too stupid to understand what's good for them.  They are too stupid, therefore they choose very bad, low-grade governments and presidents.  They believe that the thought that you need a flag and a national hymn and some national pride and your military strength and borders, it's just irrelevant.  They believe that the world should not go on like that.  They believe that there should never be a strong superpower in the world.  They believe that politicians are actually just messengers, but they don't really know how to control the world.  They believe that they have seen the light.  Therefore, they need somehow to get control over the people.  And how do you do that?  You work tirelessly to make it to the point where You, the elite, the politicians that are below them, the media that is below them, all are aligned to the point that they can affect as many people as they can globally.  This is exactly the great, I would say, chance and opportunity that COVID-19 has been giving to them the opportunity to conduct the largest drill in the history of this world.  To make sure that all the right orders from the top make it to the very last person down below.  To make it to the point that you will not only own nothing but you will be happy.  That you will understand.  That someone else can run everything in your life and you will still be happy.  But think about it.  They are missionaries to their own beliefs.  We were called to make disciples, to go and make disciples and baptize them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.  There is a battle right now going on between those who know the light of the world, who have seen the light of the world, and they are the light of the world, and those that believe that somebody else is the source of light.  And before we know it, we will be taken out of here in order for the Lord God to pour judgment upon all those that I just gave up on all of this.  Make sure you understand, the minute we're out of here, any person that will receive the mark of the beast, according to the Book of Revelation, will not be able to get saved anymore.  In fact, he won't even be able to find death because he won't be able to even control his own will.  There's a very small window of opportunity for us to share the gospel and for people to understand the Word of God, respond to it, and get saved before it's too late.  This weekend, I want to encourage you to fight the good fight.  Not to punch in the air, but to fight for the things that are worth fighting for.  but also to remember that ultimately we know the end of the story.  And until that end is turning out in a good way, which will be once we come back with Jesus and eventually there will be the thousand years Millennial Kingdom, the world is going to go through the most difficult time the history will ever remember.  Because we know we won't be here.  And we know that it's coming around the corner.  We've got a very small window of opportunities to share the gospel.  And remember, it's a battle on the light, on the truth, and on who we are.  Don't be discouraged.  We've been teaching about this for the longest time.  We've been warning about it for the longest time.  We knew it's coming and it's here.  Of all the generations, we are the only generation that on one hand see the fig tree blooming and Israel is in the land, all the beautiful things with it.  But on the other hand, we are seeing the world effort to kick God out of the picture.  and to install a new world order, a great reset.  I want to encourage you from Galilee, from Israel, and I believe this message can make it to the whole world.  Fight the good fight.  Run the race.  Keep the faith.  Because at the end, all that He wants to find us doing when we are taken out of here, is doing our Father's business, and He wants to find us faithful.  This is not the time to give up.  It's time to actually fight stronger.  And I want to remind you that the Bible says in Isaiah 8, verse 12, regarding the truth, the Bible says, do not say a conspiracy concerning all that These people call conspiracy, nor be afraid of their threats, nor be  troubled.\".  How many times did Jesus say, don't be troubled, don't be afraid, do not worry?  He said, in this world, you will have many tribulations.  I believe 2020 gave us a huge one.  He says, but be of good cheer, for I have overcome this world.  So I want to thank you and share this message.  It's a message of hope, but also of warning.  Thank you.  God bless you.  And Shabbat Shalom from Galilee. ",
