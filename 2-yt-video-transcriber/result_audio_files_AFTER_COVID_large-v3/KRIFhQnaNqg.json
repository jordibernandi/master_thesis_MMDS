And if he is still on the streets, it absolutely proved that the San Diego police department is completely corrupt.  You don't have these kinds of police officers on your police force for very long without it being on purpose.  And he looks like he's old enough to have been there for a while.  All right.  The video, the name of the channel is Traveler.  And I'll put a link in the description.  And I just don't know what else to say.  If I say anything else, I'm going to probably start cussing.  And I prefer not to do that right now.  This is PNP News.  Y'all be safe.  We're out of here.  Thank you. ",
