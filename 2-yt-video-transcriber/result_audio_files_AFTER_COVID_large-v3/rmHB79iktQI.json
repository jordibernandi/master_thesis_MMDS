            "text": "Oh, yeah, absolutely.  Well, thank you for having me.  It's an honor to be here.  Yeah, I have a family member that I love with all of my heart that battles addiction.  And addiction has affected nearly every home in America.  You know, one of my sisters say, as performers, you know, people don't understand that you go through things as well, especially in the Christian world.  Right.  The only difference, I've heard Mark Lowry say this many, many times, the only difference between you, audience, and us as performers is tonight we're holding a microphone.  Addiction has plagued this country.  And my family, my family member, I love to say it like this.  They taught me who Jesus is through their addiction.  Because to me, it was a personal.  I'm a really strong type A personality.  Therefore, I have control issues.  I know that.  I'm trying not to be so in control all the time.  And that's not easy.  But I didn't realize it was a problem.  My problem.  Until my family member died.  was not choosing life.  They were choosing addiction.  And it was devastating to me because I couldn't control it.  I couldn't control when they would drink.  I couldn't control when they would stop.  I got to the point where I was afraid to even leave the house to go anywhere because I thought I had that much control.  When I was there, they weren't going to do it.  And then it finally got to the point where it wasn't true.  So I had to learn to be able to say, okay, God, help me to be able to just give it to you.  That's why I say that's my family member taught me who Jesus is to me because I had to learn.  And I'm so grateful.  as of July the 27th of this year, they celebrate three years of sobriety.  And it's so incredible and so encouraging.  And even to the point where for me, it's like, you know, they said to me not long ago and they come watch us play all the time.  And I honestly, I share in front of people everywhere we go that, no matter what you're going through.  You know, sometimes when we pray for a problem, sometimes the situation changes.  Sometimes our outlook on the situation changes and allows us to be able to focus more on him and see what the purpose for the pain was or is.  But my family member will come and watch us play and they say to me, you know, why is that date so important to you?  Why is my sobriety so important to you?  I said, well, I said, honestly?  I said, for almost three years now, I've been able to breathe.  I'm not holding my breath wondering what's next for me.  Because when you've lived with someone that don't mean to hurt you, but you choose to stay with them and fight through it with them.  And it's not easy.  It's not easy.  Sometimes fighting through it is backing away and letting them make their own decisions. ",

You get them help and they go into rehab, they come out, they get back into it.  You're right, it's just like you're always wondering.  You know, unfortunately, you know, we lost our nephew and we lost an ex-daughter-in-law.  And it's heartbreaking.  It's heartbreaking.  You know, what would you say to somebody right now?  that's listening to you and how would you encourage them? ",

Because I really, truly believe that he will.  That's the only way that we made it through.  I'm grateful that my family member chose sobriety.  And I know that they give a lot of credit to God, but I also know, you know, we've had many conversations where they say to me, do you think I choose to be this way?  You know, I've said many times, no, I don't think you choose to be this way, but I do think you choose the first drink or the first, whatever, once you've been sober.  And that's, that's, that was the heart.  That's the battle.  So my hope is that you learn to really, really trust God.  And if you give him everything, including, the praise and also the bad times, that He will truly help you through it.  But you gotta give it all, not just a little bit.  You can't hold on to some of it and say, you know, I think maybe tomorrow I'll try this.  It's gotta be now and all the way. ",

You know, I have, I can go to somebody and say, okay, I never had a story before.  I just never, I never did.  I do.  But I never had a testimony that was just like, okay, this is impactful.  This has changed my life until fighting this and learning.  And honestly, I, my whole testimony, I turn about me finding my way through type A. Because when you really think that you're in control, but you're not, or it's not a good place to be.  I have a great friend that tells me all the time, says, Ben, she said, being in control, having control issues doesn't mean that you have, it's always bad because you just care more than everybody else.  It's like, okay, well, I'll take that as someone who just has to be in it.  So, you know, I mean, my happy place right now is everything in my life.  Thank you. ",
