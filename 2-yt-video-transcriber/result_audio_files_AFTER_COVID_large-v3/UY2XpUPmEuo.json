            "text": "Praise be Jesus Christ.  I want to read to you today the prophecy of Blessed Anna Maria Taigi on the Three Days of Darkness.  So, Blessed Anna Maria Taigi, she died in 1837.  She was 68 years old.  She's a woman who lived in Rome, and she was beatified in 1920 by Pope Benedict XV.  And Father Thomas Dub\u00e9, in his book, Happy are the Poor, He writes, Blessed Anna Maria Teige, the mother of a large family and a recipient of mystical prayer, was one of the most remarkable and best known women in the 19th century.  And Blessed Anna Maria Taigi had a remarkable gift of prophecy.  She's almost unparalleled among the saints in her phenomenal gift of prophecy.  Now, she prophesied three days of darkness.  We already hear about the three days of darkness in Scripture in a number of places, including in Exodus chapter 10.  It was one of the plagues that the Lord sent to Egypt so that Pharaoh would let the people go.  It says... Okay, here's the prophecy of Blessed Anna Maria Taigi.  She says, There shall come over the whole earth an intense darkness, lasting three days and three nights.  Nothing can be seen, and the air will be laden with pestilence, which will claim mainly, but not only, the enemies of religion.  It will be impossible to use any man-made lighting during this darkness except blessed candles.  He who out of curiosity opens his window to look out or leaves his home will fall dead on the spot.  During these three days, people should remain in their homes, pray the rosary, and beg God for mercy.  All the enemies of the church, whether known or unknown, will perish over the whole earth during that universal darkness, with the exception of a few whom God will soon convert.  The air shall be infected by demons who will appear under all sorts of hideous forms.  So scary prophecy.  It needs to be said that a prophecy from even a saint is not to be taken at the same level as the inspired sacred scripture.  So it's meant to be taken with a grain of salt.  Any prophecy comes through prophecy.  human filter and shouldn't be taken literalistically.  It's imagery that if it's coming from a saint who's known for her gift of prophecy should be taken seriously, but again, not literalistically.  So a few thoughts on this, and I'm just theorizing and speculating.  First of all, we're already in a situation where people are already locking themselves in their homes out of fear of a pestilence outside.  Now, I'm still getting out for a daily bike ride or a daily walk.  Thanks be to God, we're still allowed to do that.  It's been wonderful, and I encourage you, if you can, please do that.  But some places, you can't.  You're locked in.  Now, we've had volcanoes lately.  We know that big eruption of volcanoes can shroud parts of the world with a darkness.  And so, again, this is totally theorizing, speculating, but there could be eruption of volcanoes, for example, that could shroud the world.  in a darkness for three days, and you can't go outside because there's a pestilence.  And can you imagine, it says here, it will be impossible to use any man-made lighting during this darkness.  That could mean losing our electrical power.  But my thought is, imagine if for some reason we lost our use of the internet.  Three days, you're hunkered down, you're locked in, there's a darkness outside, a mysterious darkness, and you have no internet, no access to the outside world.  I mean, for many people, that would be devastating.  They would be forced to face themselves and their own thoughts.  Now, I mention this for two reasons.  One is, if there were to come three days of darkness during this time of pestilence, you need to know that the Lord isn't going to allow this to last for a long time.  Three days.  So hang in there.  You'll get through it.  Secondly, if you are in a situation where you're locked down, in darkness, no internet, you're supposed to pray.  Light a blessed candle, pray the rosary, repent before the Lord.  That's what we're supposed to do.  So I'm totally theorizing.  I know I'm scaring a lot of people.  Please take this with a grain of salt.  Take this as, you know, when you go out with your buddies to Denny's or to IHOP and late at night and you're saying, hey, check out this theory.  That's what I'm doing.  As a matter of fact, I'd like to hear your thoughts and comments on Blessed Anna Maria Teige's prophecy.  Viva Christore! ",
