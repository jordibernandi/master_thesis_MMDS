            "text": "Thank you.  The Silver Swan was crafted by James Cox in London in 1773.  It is a life-size clockwork automation that imitates the behaviour of a real swan.  Cox was a showman and dealer, and the swan appeared in his mechanical museum in 1774.  It is the finest example of an automaton in the United Kingdom, and one of only two of its importance and size in the world.  The mechanism is clockwork of the finest quality and was designed by the celebrated inventor John Joseph Merlin.  This clockwork-driven device has inside a music box which, when fully wound, plays as the glass rods rotate, giving the illusion of flowing water.  The swan turns its head from side to side and also preens itself.  After a few moments, the swan notices the swimming fish and bends down to catch and eat one.  This graceful silver automaton was exhibited at the 1867 World's Fair, where the admission sum cost an enormous five shillings.  It was there in Paris that Mark Twain saw the piece and later wrote, I watched the silver swan, which had a living grace about his movement and a living intelligence in his eyes, watched him swimming about as comfortably and unconcernedly as if he had been born in a morass instead of a jeweller's shop.  Others called it a magic wrought by Merlin himself.  It has more than 2000 moving parts, including 139 crystal rods and 113 rings in the neck alone.  it is said that there was originally a waterfall behind the swan, which was stolen whilst being exhibited in Paris.  The nuts and bolts, levers and cogwheels have for almost 250 years powered this life-size silver swan to play music and catch a golden fish out of a crystal stream.  At last it was purchased by the antiques dealer John Bowes, and it now sits pride of place in the Bowes Museum in the northeast of England, where every afternoon at two o'clock it comes to life.  The swan is as close to perfection as you're going to get. ",
