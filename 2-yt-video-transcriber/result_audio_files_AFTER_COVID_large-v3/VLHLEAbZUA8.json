            "text": "Good morning, good morning, bixway or roger.com.  It's your morning horn disease, your sip of chaga coffee.  All right, silver, silver, silver, silver, silver, silver.  I don't know if you guys noticed, but it was a huge day yesterday on silver.  Why?  Because silver price went down?  No, that is not the reason.  Yeah, it went down $1.50.  But what did it take to push it down $1.50?  How many ounces of electronic silver had to be sold on the comics yesterday to make the price of silver go down after it had been going up for so long?  Let's take a look.  Holy crap right here.  350,000 contracts.  It's just gone.  Remember I was screaming about this one on July 28th?  That hit 300,000 contracts.  And I was like, oh my God, that's 300,000 contracts.  We've never seen that.  Now we're at 350.  And all they could do... How much is that?  350.  Should have brought the calculator out again, huh?  350... times 5,000.  1.75 billion ounces of silver were sold yesterday just to get the price down on the convex, so it's futures and options, just to get the price down $1.50.  That's the kind of battle that's going on right now in silver.  I would say, hey, keep an eye out for open interest.  Always keep an eye out on open interest.  Remember, they got to drop about 9,000 to 10,000 contracts per day to get to a point by the end of the month that they can deliver on.  Right now, they just dropped six, about 7,000 contracts, but they need nine or 10.  So they're going to have to get a lot more contracts if they want to even get close to delivery amount.  My estimate is my last time it was 17,000 contracts.  My estimate is 30,000 contracts, which would be beyond anything anybody's ever heard of.  Double what last month was, which was crazy.  And do they have it?  They'd have to go to J.P.  Morgan.  I don't know the deal that they struck.  I do talk about it on the private road.  By the way, I have posted my private road timeline in addition to the Jenny Moonstone one and two, Christoph Melchizedek, and our friend Cliff High.  Those are all on the private road.  If you're a private road member, just go to the members area and scroll down a bit.  And it is Ruto's Road to the Future that has all those postings on.  Go check that out.  I give you my timeline where I think this craziness is all going.  And I do want to point something out.  350,000 contracts is so big.  I'm going to tell you what the average daily volume is right here.  Average daily volume for the year in silver is right here.  94,000 contracts.  So over three times, almost four times, almost four times the amount of the average daily volume for the trading day traded yesterday.  And all they got it down was $1.50.  Notice the volumes are up pretty good, 25% year to date.  Year on year, where is it?  Last month, up 25%.  If this keeps going like this in this month, I mean, it's already silly.  It's just going to get more ridiculous.  Who is it that's trading these kind of volumes?  Why isn't the CFTC in there doing anything?  Obviously, because they're a regulator.  Their job is not to regulate free and honest trading.  Their job is to run cover for the manipulations.  I hate to tell it to America, but they're lying to you.  Lying to you.  It is getting hot, by the way, in Washington.  And the latest conspiracy stuff, Trump in his last speech said, this may be the last time you'll see me for a while.  I think he's going in hiding because I think a lot of people are going to be arrested very soon.  How do I know that?  I don't.  Why do I think that?  The signs are there.  The timing is perfect.  It's clear that this election probably won't even happen.  If it does happen, it'll be contested because of the mail-in ballots for months afterwards.  If not that, if one side wins, the other side's beyond pissed off and won't accept it.  Just like what happened last time when the Democrats could not accept that Trump was president.  So this might be Trump's last time to pull the trigger and destroy the cabal.  Which means the pedophiles, the banksters, half of Congress.  Yeah, I'd get out of town too.  Look at all the presidents they took out.  Kennedy, Lincoln, yes, that was a banking coup.  And it goes on and on.  Trump, best of luck to you.  Godspeed.  Stay in the bunker.  And let's end this shit.  Here's a hint that something is happening.  150 members of Minnesota National Guard to deploy to Guantanamo.  We all heard about the big expansion of Guantanamo when Trump got in.  Why would 150 members of the National Guard be deployed to Guantanamo?  Unless all of a sudden there's an influx of people to watch over.  Very interesting times.  Again, join the road to Ruta.  I have my future prediction for silver, for cryptos, for our system, for the D-Day.  Good stuff.  And join the road to Ruta.  We're now at 50 theta.  I'm giving away 50 theta and 50 theta fuel with every private road subscription.  Just hit subscribe today.  And those who've subscribed in the last couple days, all your coins will be shipped out next week.  Oh, your tokens.  Theta tokens.  Those are the 100 Theta tokens.  They'll ship out next week.  Join now.  You get 50 Theta and 50 Theta Fuel, the future of the Internet.  The future of the Internet.  I'm going to take the weekend off.  That's my plan.  I usually don't do it very well, but that's my plan.  So, you guys, hang tough.  I'll talk to you next week.  Have a good one.  Relax.  Take a breath.  Things are happening.  And get your silver in your own possession.  Do I even have to say it anymore?  This is Biggs.  I'll talk to you guys later. ",
