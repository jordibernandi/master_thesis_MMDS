            "text": "What's happening, fam?  LAR movement still moving.  Subscribe or die trying.  You see the thumbnail.  Using sex for clout.  I was going to talk about something else and then I saw this article about Dwyane Wade and Gabrielle Union and his kids not liking this picture that they posted up on the social media or his social media.  Like, they ain't want to wake up in the morning and see that.  And the thing about it is See, first, it was looked at as, okay, you're making all this hoopla about the son coming out.  Now you're making all this hoopla about the son being a girl.  And it's like, it seemed like y'all kind of putting this kid on front street.  And then it's like making a hoopla about having a daughter.  And then making a hoopla about... How can... the family's fashionable ways using sexuality or the alphabet community type tactics to do it.  And then all of a sudden, bada boom, bada bing.  Taking, I guess, racy thirst trap photos.  I don't know what to call it, but here's the thing.  Um, If this is how y'all going to express y'allself, it's got to be for attention.  It's got to be.  Now the question is, y'all are both highly successful people who basically have had the spotlight on you forever and a day, for years.  So now it's just like you're reaching.  You just want the attention.  Dwyane Wade is retired.  When people are retired, they usually want to chill out.  If he wanted to get on TV and do something, he could honestly just be an NBA analyst just like that.  Easy.  He'd be right back on TV.  Gabrielle Union, she still does television and movies, so she's going to be right back in the spotlight at some point.  The show that she did, LA Finest, is on Netflix now.  I think it's on Netflix.  You can watch it anytime you want.  You got to do this.  You know what I'm saying?  You just got to go out there.  Oh, we grown and this is how we get down.  And there's this feminist pandering dynamic that comes across when they purposely post themselves like this.  She covered, he naked.  She dressed like a dude, he dressed like a girl.  She want to be masculine.  He want to be feminine.  But see, what's going to wind up happening is if this keeps up, there's going to be a point where something's going to have to stop or something's got to give.  And this is going to stop and it might be a fallout from it.  And then all of a sudden, you're going to have a situation where people are going to be acting like Wendy Williams acting with her brother right now.  It's cool when I'm with you and you're doing all these suspect things, but if I'm not with you, I'm going to call you all kinds of, what do you call it?  Homophobic slurs, right?  Because you're really like this and you're really like that because it's been dropping out for years.  The things that they put out publicly, you shouldn't put those things out publicly.  Some things should be behind closed doors.  And the question is, what's next?  Because this is what they're clamoring for.  Let's see, can we get their attention again?  And the problem is this.  Your kid's in the house with you.  Your kid's got to deal with this.  You know what I'm saying?  Your kid's got to deal with the fallout of y'all actions.  And I got to say this before I end this.  You got to remember, them ain't... Gabrielle Union's kids.  They're her stepkids.  So even the way this stuff posts out, she's not going this far to embarrass herself with her daughter biologically than she is to embarrass him and his sons publicly.  So you got to pay attention to that.  But like, share, subscribe.  Catch y'all in the next one.  Peace. ",
