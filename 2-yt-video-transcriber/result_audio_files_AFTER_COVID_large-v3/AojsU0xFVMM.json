I am worthy of love.  I deserve comfort and respect.  I will live how I want.  I'm valid.  The way that I present is valid.  It's okay to be unsure.  It's okay to correct people.  I am not a burden.  Asking others to give me the respect that I deserve does not make me a burden.  I am stronger than the disrespect of others.  I don't concern myself with the willingly ignorant.  I know myself better than anyone else.  I will not apologize for being who I am.  No one is entitled to my history.  Dysphoria does not define me.  Arbitrary standards Don't determine my worth.  Fuck the haters.  Chosen family is family.  I'm not alone.  I'm proud of myself.  Things will get better.  I am resilient.  And I will survive. ",
