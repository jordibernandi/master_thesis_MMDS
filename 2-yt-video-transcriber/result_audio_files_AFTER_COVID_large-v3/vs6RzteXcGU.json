Freedom Tunes, by the way, is the right wing.  I guess you can call them animations.  They're cringe as fuck.  The election goes to the Supreme Court.  This is from November 12th.  I tried to look... Here, I'll show you.  I looked at some of the more recent stuff, but none of it seemed interesting.  Shut up.  A Very Cuomo Christmas.  It's 18 seconds long.  This guy's like, ah, look, we did $500.  Cool.  How Democrats Think the Election Fraud Ended.  Official sources say this cartoon is false.  I mean, I guess technically... What we could do is we could do this, this, and this and just watch them in a row.  And maybe we could get the context of their cope.  Maybe we'll just do a whole because they're like really short.  We'll just do a series of cope real quick.  How about that?  A cope series, if you will.  I know the congressman died.  You guys are so jacked up about this.  Am I going to have to put that in the title?  I keep getting that link in chat from people that are popping in.  I'm not mad at you for popping in and being like, hey, you want to hear this news?  I just, yes, it has occurred.  It has occurred.  All right.  Hey, let's watch this. ",
