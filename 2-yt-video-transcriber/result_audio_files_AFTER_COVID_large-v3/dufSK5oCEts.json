One example we have in the Gemara Masechet Gittin is J.C.  Penney.  J.C.  Penney is there.  Onkilus in the Gemara says, Onkilus, the Ger Tzidik that all of our commentary on the Tanakh comes from, before he converted, he did a seance and he brought J.C.  Penney up, along with Bil'am and Titus.  All of them are in the seventh level of Ge'enom.  But nonetheless, that's exactly what J.C.  Penney said, described as where he is.  He's in a Tz'alotachat.  Why?  Not only did he go against the rabbis, but he caused other people to leave Judaism.  So all those Christians that pray to him every single day, they should understand that their leader, their idol, their everything is sitting there and boiling feces.  Who else goes there?  So is that we see it on purpose. ",
