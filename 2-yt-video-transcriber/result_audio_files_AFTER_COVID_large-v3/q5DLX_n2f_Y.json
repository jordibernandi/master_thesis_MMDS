So I have some interesting questions for you.  Now, we've had some good fun in the podcast because it gets a little political, obviously, but we want to show a little bit of humor.  So I have a couple questions that I think are on all of the minds of our viewers.  So the first one, which is the big one also on my mind, is which is your favorite Trump child, and why is it Ivanka?

There are probably times I regret it, but I've sort of learned, and I think we've probably seen in the last week, sometimes sort of taking it back rather than just owning it is actually worse.  You know, sort of the apology for something that doesn't necessarily need an apology.  Maybe it's a hot take, but it doesn't necessarily mean it's wrong.  I mean, I think the one we saw last week was Drew Brees.  You know, what do you think about him?  sort of cowering to the mob and that whole controversy? ",

Talk about his father and his grandfather serving.  And then the following day, it was almost like I take it back.  I was shocked because I consider him a great football player, but I consider him a champion.  and a star, and I didn't understand what was going on.  And he took it back, and I've never seen anything like it.  And I think he hurt himself very badly.  And I was going to put out that he'll regret that in the future years, because you stand for the flag.  You have to stand for the flag and the anthem.  Our national anthem, you have to stand.  And I think the NFL is going to have a lot of problems if they don't.  And I think the same thing with U.S.  soccer.  They said they're not going to have to stand.  Well, if they don't stand, nobody's going to want to watch it.  And I think they'll have a lot of problems.  But I think the NFL will.  It'll be a tremendous.  I was very surprised.  I like Roger Goodell.  I was very shocked that he made that statement.  It didn't even look like there was any pressure on him.  He made it out of nowhere.  In summertime, what's he doing?  Why is he doing that?  So I was disappointed with Roger Goodell.  I was very disappointed with Drew Brees because he was a warrior and he just caved under the pressure.  You know, a lot of warriors, they cave under PR pressure because his manager said, oh, this isn't right.  And his teammates said, this isn't right.  And everybody said, and all of a sudden he's out there disclaiming about The flag and the country, and he doesn't, I don't believe he believes his second statement.  By the way, he may believe it, but what he should be doing is not talking about the second.  He should have stuck with his first. ",

Documents that were taken in the Osama bin Laden raid, in the raid that killed Osama bin Laden with our friend, the Rob O'Neill, they finally declassified them.

And essentially, he's so grossly incompetent, it would lead to the destruction of America.
