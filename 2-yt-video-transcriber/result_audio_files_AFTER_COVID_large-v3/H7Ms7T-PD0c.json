            "text": "is the shit and you can feel like you the shit at the same time instead of walking around saying i'm the shit.  but as soon you don't say that about the white man places when they throw your ass out.  you don't say that about the chinese place because you need your hand your nails done.  when i was growing up everybody knew how to do their own shit.  it was always somebody in the hood to know how to cut hair.  it was always somebody in the neighborhood that knew how to do nails.  it was always somebody in the neighborhood that sold cigarettes and icebergs and candy.  lady y'all remember that shit.  Now, if you go to the store and it ain't there, you just asked out.  You have turned yourselves from producers.  You've turned yourselves into nothing but consumers.  And the person that's feeding you is the enemy.  Now, we all got a couple of faces here.  We got a face that we can talk.  And then we got a face that we can walk.  I'm not going to be coming in front of y'all too many more times to tell you just one more time.  You see what happened when we went to Brunswick.  They knew we was coming.  They locked them boys up.  You see what happened in Minneapolis.  They heard we was coming.  They fired them dudes and put them on their own.  But we got a bigger problem in the house to address.  I don't know goddamn body else trying to compare me or align me with anybody who came before me because I am none of them.  I got over 16,000 of y'all that came forward saying, I'm ready to fight.  I got another 2,000 that came in today.  And I got another 10,000 that I haven't even looked at.  Now something really got to be wrong out there.  if that many people is ready to die for the cause.  And these are legally armed motherfuckers.  I'm not even counting all the boys that I'm not going to put on paper that came in place.  I'm not even going to put on paper all of the gang bangers that came and said, we rocking with you.  I'm not even going to put on paper all the prisoners that are watching this shit locked up behind bars right now.  I got a brother that called me and let me know.  He said, look, brother, I got three life sentences.  I ain't never supposed to get out, but I've been having dreams about some shit going down.  and some motherfuckers outside broke in this bitch and let all of us out.  And then somebody sent me your video.  We circulating your shit around every federal prison there is.  You giving motherfuckers hope.  Come get us, nigga.  I'm not counting them.  I'm counting the people that have come and given their information and said, I want to be down.  I'm looking at over 25,000 soldiers.  So if I didn't get to you, don't worry about it.  You in there like swimwear.  25,000 people here in the United States, which is a drop in the bucket when you consider that we have over 50 million people here.  I don't want 50 million, but I'll take a mil.  Hell, if I can get a mil, I'll take five mil.  But that's still a drop in the bucket.  But right now, I got 25,000 suited and booted and ready to go.  And we was about to go down there and pay Minneapolis a visit.  They hurry up and fired them boys.  And I'm pretty sure they're going to do some more shit with them because they don't want us in their city because I'm not afraid to take the chain off and say, tear this motherfucker up.  That's the anger that we're feeling right now.  That's the anger.  to be running through a neighborhood knowing some white man is hunting you, and you still lost?  I will speak to this just because someone said it.  Desiah Stewart, 10 million.  The reason I won't say 10 million is because if you read the first book of Enoch with Yahweh's name restored, it tells you in chapter one, verse six, if you know your texts, that when Yahweh returns with the Kodash Mardukim, their numbers will be 10 million, 10 million.  I would never insult the creator by trying to raise a force equal to what he's going to bring in the last days, but I'll take half.  And we damn sure will prep the place before they get here.  Y'all don't want to admit that you in a war right now.  Y'all want to keep your heads buried in the motherfucking sand and hope it all goes away.  Really?  Really?  Did you see how comfortable that motherfucker was doing what he was doing?  He wasn't looking around because he knew y'all weren't going to do shit.  But if there had been a couple of bros jumping on a bro, shit, both them niggas would have got beat up, knocked out, stripped down of all their clothes, took their cell phone, took their Jordans, and left them laid out in the fucking street.  And they would have woke up and said, we don't know what happened.  But you can't do that to them.  Let them pull that shit around us.  I'm going to keep it 100.  Let them pull that shit.  You've seen how we treated the police in Georgia.  We're not afraid of those motherfuckers.  At all.  We know what you've already done.  We know what you are capable of doing.  We know that you will shoot us if you get the chance.  So guess what?  It's like the shootout at the OK motherfucking corral.  Who you think will get the first shot off first?  You ain't the only one that go to the range and practice.  You ain't the only one that can hit a target 3,000 yards away with one shot.  You ain't the only one that got a shot through this motherfucking tight.  You ain't the only one.  And if y'all can get like that, you will find out.  We angry.  But y'all got somebody to call now.  We like the black police force.  And when we show up, I'ma say it one last time before I go.  When we show up, when we come, I'ma say it one more time.  You're going to hear us before you see us.  And when you see us, don't get scared because you brought this shit on yourself.  Y'all stay black as you can be.  As for me and mine, we're going to finish doing what we said we was going to do. ",
