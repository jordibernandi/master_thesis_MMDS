I know Vice President Biden and his wife, and I'm grateful to have called his son Beau a friend who also served in the National Guard.  Although I may not agree with the vice president on every issue, I know that he has a good heart and he's motivated by his love for our country and the American people.  I'm confident that he will lead our country guided by the spirit of aloha, respect and compassion, and thus help heal the divisiveness that has been tearing our country apart. ",

            "text": "Okay.  Um.  So what do we make of this?  What do we make of this?  First of all, I'm really disappointed that she endorsed Joe Biden.  I'm not going to lie.  I think that this is not the way that I would have done it.  I would not have endorsed Joe Biden if I were her, of course.  I'm not running for president.  I'm not dealing with the stressors and the pressure of running or being a Democrat or being somebody in Congress.  So I'm, of course, looking at everything from a completely outsider, bystander point of view.  It's not really fair to assess from this perspective.  point of view in particular, but I wouldn't have endorsed Joe Biden.  I would have endorsed Bernie Sanders or I would have not endorsed anybody at all.  I would have pulled an Elizabeth Warren and said, you know, I'm just not going to do anything at this point in the race.  I mean, at this point, we're seeing Joe Biden take state after state after state.  And I don't think Tulsi is wrong in that.  the obvious, you know, it looks obvious that the eventual nominee is unfortunately going to be Joe Biden.  And even though that I think is obvious, it still hasn't happened yet.  And so I would have personally reserved my endorsement.  I would have said, you know, I stand with Bernie Sanders.  Or, you know, if you feel like, well, OK, but Bernie is obviously a guy that's going to eventually get out of the race as well right now, then I would have just held back and not endorsed anybody at all.  That's what I would have personally done.  That's what I wish she would have done.  I nearly had a heart attack when I saw that she endorsed Joe Biden.  Now, you know what?  She's got her own reasons as to why she wants to go ahead and endorse Joe.  They all have to endorse Joe.  We will see Bernie Sanders come out and endorse Joe.  So if people say, well, this just goes to show she's not a progressive, then what are you going to say about Bernie Sanders?  Are you going to say Bernie Sanders isn't a progressive when he endorses Joe Biden?  Are you just going to give up and say, oh, gosh, I'm throwing the baby out with the bathwater?  I don't think that's\u2014 the way to approach this.  Now, I don't agree with Tulsi on this decision.  I don't agree with Tulsi on about 15 percent of her decisions.  But that doesn't mean that I turn my back and say, OK, then I no longer support you.  You're a grifter.  You're a traitor.  You're not real.  You're phony.  You know, all of those things.  I don't believe that.  I don't agree with Bernie Sanders 15 percent of the time, either.  But it doesn't mean I sit there and say, well, because he's not a real progressive or that just means he's not going to get my vote.  If I want to agree with somebody 100 percent of the time, then I need to run for office.  So I give a bit of leeway on decisions.  You know, if it's not something that I'm fundamentally against, then I say, OK, you know, we're just going to have to agree to disagree.  I'm pretty fundamentally against Joe Biden.  Um, I am not one that's going to vote for him.  If he's on the ticket, there are very few circumstances and maybe, you know, maybe this is what Tulsi's thinking about.  The only circumstances in which I would vote for Joe Biden is if he has his running mate is either Bernie Sanders or Tulsi Gabbard.  So I don't know, maybe Joe Biden went to Tulsi and said, Hey, listen, I think you're a great running mate.  Um, I think that would make a lot of sense.  And I'll tell you why.  He's, for one, already said that he wants a woman.  Now, I would, by the way, I just want to say I would cringe at that ticket.  I mean, a Biden-Gabbard ticket.  Yeah, I would end up voting for it because Tulsi's on that ticket.  And I know Joe Biden is probably not going to last throughout his term.  So I would definitely vote for that ticket.  Same thing with Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden.  Although, you know, both of those guys are kind of older, and then what is it?  That defaults down to the speaker of the House, doesn't it?  So then we'd get Nancy Pelosi.  OK, you know, anyway, let's not think about that.  It's not going to happen.  Joe Biden already said he's going to pick a woman.  So if Joe Biden selects Tulsi Gabbard, that would be the smartest choice, because anybody else he's considering is not going to be helpful to him.  some ideas that they've thrown around.  Stacey Abrams, for example.  Well, Joe doesn't need help in the South.  He already has the South vote.  And not only that, but the South isn't going to vote for Joe Biden in the general election.  They're going to go with Donald Trump.  So that's a part of the country that you've pretty much lost.  Joe Biden could pick Amy Klobuchar.  She gets that northern rust belt, but so does Joe.  So that doesn't really help him either.  Elizabeth Warren is an interesting selection for him.  He could think that he's going to bring in the progressive vote by bringing on Elizabeth Warren.  But I think that is still risky.  I think that's a risky choice because a lot of progressives do not feel Elizabeth Warren is progressive.  And so she's not totally.  You know, that would still be risky.  Tulsi Gabbard, on the other hand, would bring in the progressives that were supporting Bernie Sanders.  And she would also bring in those libertarians who do not want to vote for Donald Trump.  They are on the more Republican side.  So they would get a huge number of votes if Joe Biden did that.  So I don't know.  Maybe Joe went to Tulsi and said, I'm considering you for vice president for my running mate.  And if that's the case, and we've seen that Bernie Sanders has not really stood up for her time after time again.  And if Joe Biden offered an olive branch, then, you know, maybe that's what she's thinking.  I don't know what she's thinking.  I'm just hoping that's maybe it.  Because I just would have never endorsed Joe Biden.  But, you know, let me just tell you.  So.  Look, everybody's got to, you know, voting is deeply personal.  And it is just something you've got to wrestle with on your own at the ballot box.  And you've got to decide who you're going to vote for.  And it's individual.  For me, you know, Tulsi Gabbard.  I feel should have gotten out of the race after New Hampshire.  That's my personal feeling on it.  I was with her all the way through New Hampshire.  She put a lot of investment in New Hampshire.  She put a lot of resources in New Hampshire.  I still hoped that there would be this kind of last momentum that was gained in New Hampshire, that she would maybe come in third and it would kind of breathe the life more into her campaign.  That didn't happen, unfortunately.  It was a very sad day for me.  That's what I was banking on.  And when I saw that she wasn't going to get anything out of New Hampshire, I realized I felt like the campaign was over.  Now, she did not choose to exit the race.  She did not choose to suspend her campaign.  And ultimately, when it came down to forecasting my vote in the state of California where I am, I voted for Bernie Sanders because I did not feel like Tulsi Gabbard could get\u2014 I don't think she got the momentum she needed, and I didn't think she was going to get it.  And I am not loyal to a person.  I am not loyal to a campaign.  I am loyal to an idea.  That is where my loyalty lies.  I want the establishment to come crumbling down more than anything right now.  I think we are in a whirlwind of trouble in this country.  We are headed for a banana republic, for an oligarchy.  And when it gets to that\u2014and it's already pretty much there.  And, you know, that kind of thing, a true grip\u2014 on our political system in that way is something that is so difficult to break.  It takes generations.  It's not something that's going to go away in an election cycle.  It's something that's not going to go away in a decade.  It takes 40 or 50 years.  When you look at what's going on in Brazil with Operation Car Wash, for example, or for some other... Now, there's a lot of controversy when it comes down to the politics in Brazil.  And I understand that there's a lot of factors and there's a lot of people at play and a lot of people trying to get people out of office and whatnot.  But, you know, they allowed for\u2014the left had taken over Brazil for a very long time, and there was found to be quite a bit of corruption that ultimately infiltrated their political system.  We're seeing that now here in the United States.  We've got Joe Biden, and potentially he's going to be the nominee for the Democrats.  I mean, give me a break.  Democrats were sitting there complaining.  They've been complaining for four years about Donald Trump, who's got Twitter thumbs and can't control his mouth.  And now the person they're giving us is Joe Biden, who can't even remember things.  I mean, these are the guys that they're putting up to run our country.  So, you know, and then we got Joe Biden who's greasing the wheels for his son, getting him all kinds of jobs that are multimillion dollar jobs that you and I could only ever dream of.  I mean, just bullshit is what's going on in this country.  It is bought out.  Our politicians go off to Congress and they make boatloads of money when they're supposed to be servants of the people.  And they're not.  We have fallen into an oligarchy.  We've fallen into a banana republic.  To me, it is dire circumstances.  And yes, Tulsi Gabbard was my favorite candidate.  But at the end of the day, I am loyal to an idea, an idea that I personally am holding firm to, and that is that I want the establishment to come down.  Now, Bernie Sanders, is he perfect?  No.  Like I said, I don't agree with 15% of what he has to say.  There's a lot on foreign policy, some of his rhetoric there.  Fine.  But at the end of the day, I like him enough that I think he is going to be against the establishment.  So my point in bringing this up is, Tulsi has her own personal feelings as to what motivates her, what gets her up out of bed, what she feels like is the most important thing for this country going forward.  And if she feels like the most important thing, and Bernie Sanders feels this way, is removing Donald Trump from office, then yeah, she's probably going to endorse Joe Biden and say, this is where I'm circling the wagons around Joe.  We've got to push forward and fight.  That is before Bernie Sanders has exited the race.  I did the same thing.  I did the same thing.  I ended up voting for a candidate.  that was my second choice, close second, so I'm not at all ashamed by my vote.  And I did that before Tulsi Gabbard exited the race.  So, you know, I'm not one to criticize.  I'm not one to throw stones at her and say, oh, you know, how dare you?  Is it what I would have done?  No.  But guess what?  A lot of people wouldn't have voted for Bernie Sanders when it came to the California primary with Tulsi Gabbard still in the race.  They would have cast their vote for her.  My dad certainly did.  He said, ah, to hell with it.  I'm still voting for Tulsi.  I don't care.  You know, but for me, I have my personal reasons and I'm sure she does too.  And we all do.  And that's why we're casting our votes.  It is for me more important to bring the establishment down than it is to defeat Donald Trump.  That's just how I order things.  I, you know, I'm a bit afraid of Joe.  But if Joe, I'm afraid of his rhetoric.  I'm afraid of his foreign policy.  I'm afraid that any Democrat besides Bernie and Tulsi who gets in office is going to just try to do anything opposite of what Donald Trump did, even the good stuff.  So Donald Trump trying to make a deal with the Taliban to get us out of Afghanistan.  I worry that the next president is going to come in and say, oh, you know what?  Well, that's what Donald Trump wanted to do.  We're not going to do that.  I worry that the next president is going to come in and say, oh, he was trying to do these photo ops with Kim Jong-un.  to keep peace.  Well, we're not going to do that.  And then they end up bullying the guy and pressuring the guy without a full understanding of Asian culture and not understanding that.  shame is an incredible driving factor for Asian people.  And if you push Kim Jong-un and make him feel shameful in any way, that is enough for him to potentially unload a weapon on the It's, it's just, you can't understand.  unless you are in Asian culture, you can't understand how, what, anyway, um, I just worry that anybody who gets in office is going to ultimately undo even the good stuff that Trump is trying to do.  And that to me is very, very scary.  So that's why Joe Biden is scary to me personally.  Now, um, I don't know what the future holds for Tulsi.  I know a lot of people are very angry about this endorsement.  I think that, you know, try to breathe and not throw the baby out with the bathwater.  I'm not going to throw the baby out with the bathwater.  when it comes to Bernie Sanders.  I know a lot of people did in 2016 when he ultimately turned around and endorsed Hillary Clinton.  I think you're underestimating just how much he hates Donald Trump when you do that.  And it's just not what I'm gonna do.  I'm not gonna do that.  I'm not gonna go that far.  But I won't vote for Joe Biden unless he has Bernie Sanders or Tulsi Gabbard on that ticket, period.  Bottom line, if he selects Amy Klobuchar or Stacey Abrams, or God forbid, Hillary Clinton, I'm not going to do it.  I'm just not going to do it.  I will vote third party.  I will write in a candidate for the new Bull Moose Party that we absolutely clearly need to create in this country.  The only way forward is a third party.  And that needs to be a coalition between the right and the left populist.  And that's what we've got to do to move forward from here.  So I am disappointed, of course, today, even though I ultimately ended up casting my vote for Bernie Sanders.  I was very saddened to hear the news from Tulsi.  You know, by the way, I let her know.  When I voted for Bernie, I told her, I said, hey, listen, I want you to know.  I've supported your campaign.  I've supported you.  I believe in you and your message.  But I ended up casting my vote for Bernie Sanders because I believe in the anti-establishment progressive movement.  That is where my loyalty lies in getting rid of the establishment.  She was very understanding and appreciative of my transparency.  and also was nice enough to let me know today in advance that she was going to be making this announcement.  That's the type of person she is.  She doesn't hold a grudge.  She's a really good person.  She comes from a really good family.  They are just genuinely good people.  I know people misinterpret them.  They might think they're strange or odd or they can't understand her motives or whatever.  But salt of the earth, excellent people.  She is a really good person.  I'm sure her heart is in the right place.  As we know, she says this about Joe Biden.  Bernie Sanders says this about Joe Biden.  Maybe Joe's heart is in the right place.  A lot of people's hearts are in the right place.  But the road to hell is paved with good intentions.  Thank you so much for watching the show.  Please subscribe.  Hit the bell.  We're going through crazy times right now.  And I appreciate your support.  Thank you so much for watching. ",
