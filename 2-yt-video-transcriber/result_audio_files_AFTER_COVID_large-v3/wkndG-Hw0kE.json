            "text": "hey folks it's patriot nurse.  join me.  today we're going to discuss some good finds from the dollar tree that will help you pad your prepping stores.  so i went to the dollar tree today and i was able to pick up a bunch of things and i want to show them to you and explain why i got them what i'm thinking and how my mental calculus works.  first off before we get started make sure if you want to stay in the loop and know when i put videos out make sure that you have not only subscribed but click the little bell.  People are telling me, I'm not getting notifications that you're putting any videos out.  That may be why.  So just verify.  You may need to actually unsubscribe and then resubscribe again.  Just don't forget to resubscribe.  Like, I don't know why anything happened.  I can't find out.  That may be why.  Okay.  All right.  In all seriousness, let's get started here.  I've got some food items and I have some personal items as well.  Actually, less medical stuff specifically in this one because, frankly, there just wasn't a great supply of... quality medical prep items at the Dollar Tree right now.  It could be because of the whole Rona bit that's going on.  But I want to go over some of the food items that I found and discuss why I got them with you.  Okay, so the first thing here.  We've got these little smaller V8 juices, and these are the fruit juices, the 100% fruit juices.  Now, there's the sliding scale, obviously, of acceptable, good, better, best, as far as organic and whatever.  But my mentality here is focusing on being prepared for people and especially being prepared towards giving charity and extending grace and mercy towards people that God's put in my life.  That in itself is probably warranting a video on the mercy component of prepping.  Not subsidization of poor life choices, but mercy, right?  Because it's one thing to... It's one thing to persist in poor behavior.  When the safety net becomes a hammock, that's a different story.  But I got these basically because they do have a good amount of nutrients in them.  For instance, vitamin A and vitamin C. in each bottle, you're getting about 30%, 35%, which isn't a ton, but it can help stave off a lot of issues when it comes to chronic shortages.  in, for instance, the water-soluble vitamins like vitamin C and B. You need to have a regular input of those.  And really, these are helpful too because kids sometimes can get kind of finicky and they don't tend to want to drink water, but you can kind of cut the water with a little bit of juice to make it more palatable.  Now also, I have the V8 juice and then the cranberry cocktail.  Now the cranberry's got a little bit of sugar in it, but If a person decided that they wanted a Cosmopolitan, not a good time to be without it in the midst of challenging, challenging times.  But the V8 juice, it's a good thing to have.  You know, people, they really do tend to poo-poo, you know, V8 for its salt content, but they forget about the potassium.  And potassium is A, an electrolyte, B, important for your muscles to work, and C, it's important for your heart to actually be able to contract.  If your potassium and your calcium are off, your electrolytes are off, your heart's going to get kind of wonky.  So I like V8 for that reason too.  And, you know, It's a dollar for a can.  I also got the Goya beans here because why not?  Why not?  But they're, it's good company and it's also kosher gluten free.  So there you go.  Life's good.  Now I got a few things here besides the canned stuff.  I was actually able to find these green split peas as well.  And split peas and lentils cook pretty quickly.  They're pretty energy conscious as far as being able to put food into action with minimal energy usage.  And really when you think about it, if you're not using something like an instant pot, or you're not using something that is plug and play, essentially.  If you're using campfire, or you're using gas, or you're using propane, you can pretty quickly go through a lot of your fuel if you're cooking some of these older, or excuse me, if you're cooking some of these other types of beans.  So I like the green peas and the lentils as well.  Every now and then you can score lentils at the Dollar Tree.  Didn't see any this time, but the split peas were good to go, so I grabbed some.  I did.  Now there's a few things also that I grabbed and I want to talk about.  So I got this dish pan.  Now the dish pan is a useful thing to store items in, help organize pantries.  But actually, if you end up having to give a patient a bed bath, and having given a few of these in my life, I can definitely speak with a certain degree of authority on this.  But having your little pan like this together where you can throw your wash rags and then your soap and warm water and everything, This is a really nice thing.  Actually, I owe this to a wonderful CNA that I worked with named Misty.  So Misty, wherever you're at.  Thanks, darling.  Really, really wonderful, wonderful team member.  And it was Misty who first showed me this is her method.  And she would take her herb.  bucket, if you will, in doing bed baths for patients.  And you'll put the wash rags in there, and essentially you've got a self-contained little unit that you can transport to the bedside area, take care of your patient's bathing needs, and then deal with the dirty rags, et cetera.  You never put the dirty rags back in the clean one.  That goes without saying, but I guess common sense is not so common anymore, is it?  um it makes.  it makes actually a lot of sense to prepare for things like this and i've spoken about the necessity of having extra linens in in your stores and regularly changing a bed sheets.  these are things that were frankly taught in home ec but since we stopped teaching home ec in school we have suffered en masse with knowing how to run homes efficiently, properly, and definitely from a sanitary standpoint.  So fresh laundering of linens is quite important.  And by the way, the Dollar Tree is actually a really good place to get those little things of like gain detergent or downy.  I know some people don't like the chemicals in it or whatever, but you know, you've got a small amount of portable soap with which to, you know, launder linens and clothes that are very, very useful.  Okay, so let's talk about cleanliness in the home.  Now a lot of this actually I am touching on and going into in my online course, which Lord willing will be unveiled at the end of this month.  We're going to be talking about the appropriate changing of linens and and ways to support people in recovering from illness and keeping people well.  and cleanliness is next to godliness friends.  so in the dollar tree you can often find these guys right here the little gloves.  now aside from keeping your manicure lasting longer ladies The gloves are helpful because it allows us to really be more industrious and approach cleaning tasks with vigor.  And I really like these gloves because they slip on easy, but also they have two colors.  They have pink and then they have yellow, I think, normally.  So yellow for me is... like bathroom and deep cleaning and pink is for dishes.  so you can also by the way this is important point in order for you to appropriately sanitize your dishes.  if you don't have a dishwasher that's running on high temperature you're going to need that water to be pretty hot and it's probably not going to be good for your hands or comfortable.  so having gloves will help help make your life a little bit easier.  also let's see here.  i got so many things here i want to tell you all about.  Okay, so we talked about cleanliness here.  Let me give a shout out to the disposable cups.  I bet you didn't think you were going to see that.  So I got disposable spoons, little tiny shot glasses.  No, we're not doing jello shooters.  And the cups.  Now why would we include this?  For a moment here, I want to speak about trying to decrease cross-contamination risk.  I also touch on this a bit in my course that I'm going to be unveiling.  But it is very important, friends, if you've got one person in the house who is showing signs and experiencing symptoms of a contagious or infectious disease, it is important that you limit the risk for transmissibility between people.  Now, that's very hard in households that are as densely packed as some of the ones that I've been in.  But ways that we can practically mitigate this risk is to have disposable items for use in a sick person's room or for use in caring for the sick.  And when you look at, for instance, people who are not really able to tolerate solid foods and who maybe have to have a little bit spoonful by spoonful, whether broths or something like that, the disposable spoons are helpful.  because you are not bringing that back into the same shared kitchen, right?  You're throwing it away.  And also the same thing with the cups as well.  Now let's talk about the shot glasses here.  Well, yeah, they call them 24 shot cups.  That's what they call them.  These are actually almost the same size as the pill cups that I use whenever I'm setting up meds.  So it is a much more hygienic way of helping people be able to take their meds.  That way you're not literally touching their pills and then touching their hands and then they're touching again to their mouth and then... This is just a much cleaner way of dispensing medication appropriately.  You put the pills into the cup.  You verify, obviously, what you're supposed to be doing.  Y'all know how to give medicine, I hope, if you're giving somebody medicine at regular intervals.  And you put the cup in front of them.  And if you need to, you can assist them.  So having disposable items is a helpful thing.  And also I'll tell you from a practicality and a mercy standpoint, if you have someone, for instance, who's doing yard work for you or is helping you do manual tasks and it's hot outside like it is now, it's nice to be able to give them a disposable cup to take like a glass of water or something to them.  That way they don't feel like, you know, I don't know if they clean their dishes or whatever.  Another practical thing that I love at the Dollar Tree is the reusable aluminum foil, essentially take out dishes, covered dishes.  Because if you are caring for someone who is sick, or if you have a member of your church or your faith-based community that you're that you're ministering to, and you're bringing them meals, the last thing that you want to do when you're sick is do dishes, right?  So having throw out disposable plates, essentially, that you can take meals to people with, that's a great idea.  That's a bonus.  Okay.  One thing that is a pretty sweet deal is this chest rub.  Now, I know that over the years, Vicks and other similar products like this have become a little bit more, I don't know, people call them suspect.  They say, oh, don't use it for this, that, and the other.  Listen, if you've been to the Caribbean, you know this is used for everything from sinusitis to hangovers.  So... So I like it a lot actually because I find that it does give when rubbed on the chest not eaten God forbid and not like put in the nose.  But when rubbed on the chest and used for the appropriate indications It does relieve some chest congestion for people who are having issues with that.  so I find it helpful.  Another thing that I found is the Vaseline.  now any sort of chapstick will be fine but you'll know if you spend any amount of time outside and and doing manual activities, your lips get chapped, really something awful and there's nothing more miserable than that.  So definitely want to stock up on this in bulk.  Another good one dollar item is the Oral Care Kit.  Now a note here about this, these are soft bristles.  I believe this may be the only item in the toothbrush aisle that is soft bristles.  It's important for you to have soft bristles because you don't want to damage your teeth and we use the stuff that's not soft.  it is easier to do that.  So, with this little guy right here, you get a nice toothbrush, you get a tongue scraper, important, you get the mirror, obviously, and then the probe.  And people have found out in recent months when things got shut down, including dental offices because they weren't essential, that your oral hygiene is critical.  How that's not essential, I don't know, because I'm pretty sure that routine maintenance of a person's dentition, which is five fingers away from their heart, is very important for overall health.  But what would I know?  I'm just Patriot Nurse.  How'd you like that one?  Oh, that was pretty pippy.  No, that gets me really steamed as a matter of fact, because when you look at what happens to people who have neglected their dental health, it sets them up for a whole bunch of different risks, like serious risks, but I'm serious.  Take your hand right here, put your thumb next to your jaw, and march your little fingers down, five fingers to your heart.  So it is critical that you pay attention to your dental health.  Toothbrush can save your life.  I did a video on that too.  I'll try and link to it up here.  True lemon.  This is non-GMO, no bad stuff in it.  Citric acid, lemon oil, and lemon juice.  Now, y'all know that I am a southerner through and through, and this southern lady likes lemon in her tea.  However, people forget this, and I don't want to be stuck not having my lemon.  Here we go.  No need to suffer, y'all.  Now I've got two of these.  These are little pencil bags.  Now why in the world would pencil bags be a good thing to have?  Because in the case of this little clear see-through bit, you can organize loose items, keep them together and readily accessible, but also you can find them quickly.  It is the worst thing trying to find some little item, like digging through your purse.  I know like 70% of my audience is men.  And so hopefully you guys aren't dealing with this, but hey, you never know.  But practicality here, you got gun cleaning stuff or equipment just a bunch of small loose ends.  having it all together in one place like this is a really really nice thing.  so i'm a big believer in having these and they're more durable than the ziploc you know.  plastic bag sort of thing.  good thing to have.  last thing i've got here for this particular iteration actually no it isn't the last thing i've got.  i've got other things.  look at me just wanting to to quit early on.  I've got the USB cable charger.  This is the high speed charger and data transfer cable.  Y'all get into the habit of charging your phones, right?  Because even if it's just an extra 15 to 20 minutes, if you need it, that 15 to 20 minutes could be a deal breaker.  So get into the habit of keeping things staged, having it with you, maybe in a bug out bag, something like that to definitely your car to make sure that you have the ability to charge your phone.  Okay, now this other little thing here.  How darling is this?  Yes, it's a bottle opener.  And, shield your eyes.  and an LED light.  Isn't that cool?  The reason why I like these guys is because if you just need a quick shine of light for like finding the keyhole for your door or something like that, you don't want to bust out your Surefire, right?  You don't want to burn through those one, two, three batteries.  Those things are expensive.  It's nice to have a little guy like this, just a quick little gizmo here to meet your needs.  Speaking of light, $1 for this little guy.  Isn't it beautiful what you can get at the Dollar Tree?  The reason why I like these candles is A, they're bright.  B, they last long.  C, they are self-contained.  You don't have to worry about putting them in.  you know, a jar or something like that, you've got it, and you can hand it to somebody.  A lot of these, as I say, again, are great mercy items, and they're wonderful for being able to just practically meet needs when you can.  And I'm big into that.  I'm definitely big into that.  Speaking of meeting needs, I'm going to put a link in the description box below.  I was made aware just a little bit ago of two orphaned young children, two orphaned boys, in Houston and essentially both their parents died a couple of weeks.  apart from complications, what they're saying, related to the big C. And their church family is, I think, taking care of a lot of the family's needs at this point.  But there is, there's a link there to the story and then also within that story is a GoFundMe.  If you are a member of a Bible-based and a Bible-believing community, you know that we are charged with defending the orphan and the widow, and specifically with caring for the orphan.  So I would encourage you to give that a look if you haven't.  Because meeting needs and taking care of people, that's why we do this.  It is.  That's why we're preparing for things, and that's why we try and have storehouses, just like Joseph in the Bible.  I don't wax too much into the biblical foundation for things too often.  Perhaps I should.  But definitely with Joseph, Joseph essentially saved ancient Egypt because of his wisdom and because of his obedience and faith.  saving in the good years in preparation for the bad.  And we can be a blessing to people.  I'm just going to call this one like it is, guys.  For people who are just saving things just to save things and stockpile things just to stockpile, a person has to ask themselves, why are we doing this?  For what end?  To what purpose?  And for what end?  And in my view, we're doing this not only to care for the people that we are charged with safeguarding, but also to practically be able to minister to people and to meet a need in people's life and show mercy and compassion and grace at a time when people are desperate.  And when people are desperate, when we can in a positive way impact somebody's life, you're making ripple effects for eternity.  And I'm a big believer in that.
