You know, I didn't have as much honor as I needed.  And I've decided, you know what, I'm going to pray for authority.  I'm going to stand for people.  If I don't like something, I'm going to go to God about it, and God's going to change it.  You know, I prayed someone out, a sketchy person out of an apartment next to me.

And then as I discovered from going to rallies and getting there a little bit earlier and earlier, I found out that the experience before the rally, not the same as being in the rally, it's much different, but it's just as enjoyable on a certain level.  And so I come to the rally early, not so much because I want to get a great seat inside or a great place to stand, but really because I enjoy talking to people about conservative politics in an area in which I know it's going to be supported.  And it's not so much me, because I'm pretty forward about my politics, but there are a lot of people who are just like me who did not support Trump in 2016 and now do, and I like hearing their stories about what it was that made them come around.
