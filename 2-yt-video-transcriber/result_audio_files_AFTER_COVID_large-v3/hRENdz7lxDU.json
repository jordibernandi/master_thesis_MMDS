            "text": "Hey, it's me, DL Hughley.  I'm just being released from St.  Thomas Hospital in Nashville.  I want to thank them for taking such good care of me.  I want to thank you all for your well wishes and your prayers.  And you comedians who called such evil things when I was scared to death, thank you too.  I really appreciate it.  Thank you, everybody, for your prayers and well wishes.  When I came, I was being treated for extreme exhaustion.  dehydration, which I was very dehydrated.  But it turns out they ran a battery of tests.  And I also tested positive for COVID-19, which blew me away.  I was what they call asymptomatic.  I didn't have any symptoms.  that, you know, other classic symptoms I didn't have.  flu-like symptoms.  I didn't have a shortness of breath.  I didn't have difficulty breathing.  I didn't have a cough.  I didn't have a low grade fever.  I still don't have a fever.  I didn't have a loss of smell or taste.  Apparently I just lost consciousness.  So in addition to all the other stuff you have to look out for, if your ass pass out in the middle of a show on stage, you probably need to get tested.  So I am going back to my hotel room to quarantine for 14 days.  and Well, thank you for your prayers and your well wishes and a few more of them wouldn't hurt.  So hopefully I won't develop symptoms.  Maybe this is as bad as it gets and I'll just pass out over and over again or not.  But thank you.  I appreciate your thoughts and your prayers.  They did not go unnoticed or unfilled.  Thank you. ",

            "text": "Hey, what's going on guys?  I'm Dr.  Boyce Watkins.  So let me first of all say something that, you know, I heard DL Hughley, who's a guy who I consider to be a friend.  I saw him at Willie D's party about maybe six months ago.  And I really like DL a lot.  I think he's cool.  And I heard that he passed out, he passed out on stage.  I didn't wanna see that, it made me very sad.  And then I saw he was better, that made me happy.  And then I saw he mentioned he tested positive for COVID-19.  And I said, man, I hope he doesn't correlate.  In statistics, you have two factors.  You have what they call correlation, and then you have causation.  Correlation means two things just happen to happen at the same time.  Causation is when one thing causes the other.  And so I heard DL say that, he said, well, just watch out.  He said, I had no symptoms.  I didn't lose my sense of smell.  I didn't, whatever.  But then he says, apparently passing out on stage is a symptom of COVID-19.  um i'm not gonna say he's not correct or that he's lying.  i'm not a doctor i'm not here to do that.  i don't know his situation and i like the guy i really do.  um but i would like to hear that from a doctor right like.  i think that when you when you talk about that on a big public forum you have to kind of make sure it's it's information that's qualified.  so did the doctor say that you passed out because you had covet?  or was it just?  you know you happen to have it and you happen to also have exhaustion and dehydration and some other maybe underlying scenarios that weren't being talked about because the COVID wasn't affecting him until the pass out day.  So here's the thing, right?  Like if I break my leg and then go to the doctor And which leads them to test me for a lot of things, including COVID.  I could come back and say, well, I found out I have COVID.  And apparently one of the symptoms of COVID is breaking your leg.  It'll cause you to break your leg.  It doesn't mean that it can't be true.  It just means it has to be proven.  Right.  It has to be.  the connection has to be made.  And I think, you know, a lot of us sometimes we're confusing what it means to die with COVID.  versus dying from COVID or whatever it is.  And I don't want DL to die.  But that's actually an interesting microcosm of what I think is happening around the country, where I believe COVID's in a lot of places.  I guarantee, mark my words, mark my words, in the next few weeks, as they do more testing, you're going to have thousands and thousands of new cases that are going to emerge because there are millions of people who have caught COVID and did not die and did not die.  It does not mean COVID is not bad.  It doesn't mean it can't be deadly.  But remember, don't forget the flu can be deadly too.  So there's a lot of things out here that would be deadly for a person with a weak immune system that are going to be fine for most people.  So I'm not saying COVID is in that category at all.  I'm not saying I want you to go out and get it.  I'm saying that when I looked at, I think data matters, right?  So when I looked at CDC data, what was interesting to me was I saw that only if you have a thousand people in a room, only four of them are going to catch COVID.  They said four, it's 400 out of a hundred thousand, which is four out of every thousand.  And, and so I, What that means is that if you have 1,000 people in a room, based on the death rate, I think that, sorry, scratch that, if you have 100,000 people in a room, I think maybe 20 or 30 might die, right, out of 100,000.  So, you know, I think it's important to have facts.  I'm not saying that you should be afraid or not be afraid.  I don't have a right to tell you whether you should or shouldn't be afraid.  I don't believe we should legislate fear.  And I think that it's become so political that people aren't getting truth.  And I would just like for people to get truth.  So I think what Dio said reflected his belief about COVID.  And I think a lot of people could have gone in that same situation, passed out on stage, found out they had COVID and said, you know what, I need to stay hydrated because apparently the COVID isn't affecting me.  but the dehydration did so anyway.  feel free to leave your comments um and don't leave stupid comments like what you're saying is dangerous doc.  no i'm backing my up with facts.  so if you don't like facts don't get mad at me get mad at the facts or get mad at whoever lied to you and doesn't want you to have the facts Because I'm a big advocate of black people thinking for ourselves and not letting left wing, right wing media think for you.  You got to be smart in that black people are going to keep on raping you and exploiting you and using you up.  That's why you got played up until this point.  It's because you're letting those folks think for you.  You need to think for yourself and then figure out what your conclusion is going to be.  I'm out of here, guys.  Talk to you later.  Peace. ",
