How would I get this hat if I wasn't the host, idiot?  Anyways, last week I thought that my wife Emma had finally returned after being kidnapped by my nemesis, Colonel Dufree.  I was a little bit worried that maybe she was gathering information for him, but it turned out it wasn't even her.  It was actually Colonel Dufri who had put his mind inside Emma's body.  And I found out when we went out for dinner and they asked, what's your name?  And Emma said, Dufri, or I mean, Emma, or I mean, whatever Emma's last name is.  And then they ran off.  So I'm still without a wife, but we do have a wonderful episode for you this week as Stevopath the Cop calls another show and Tailgater makes a Tinder profile.  Plus, we call JJ McCartney and Adam Carolla.  First, though... Tech Head Terry had his heart broken last week once again on the Patreon episode, as his new friend Ray found out about the channel as well.  So it's back to the basics for Terry, and that's calling shows about tech.  And he called a big one this week.  Well, not a big one.  He called Ben Shapiro.  Check it out. ",

I was basically the demographic being a man and everything.  LAUGHTER Yeah.  Right.  Well, my my dad.  OK, so my dad's like a cool guy for his age.

He's like he's like 60 years old, but he's got like a pretty good sense of humor, you know, like a decently edgy sense of humor and isn't like a square kind of dude.  um so he's yeah and but he's got this.  uh he's got this one friend who's like this elderly dude basically and he's like he's always got that.  you know the old man stink breath and the white stuff on the side of his uh of his mouth and he's got the jowls and he's you know he's got that gross old man smell.  do you know what i could do to maybe tell my dad to stop hanging out with this guy.  oh you want advice.  Yeah, it was probably not the theme of what we're doing here, but sounds like he's going to die in about 10 minutes.  Maybe just wait it out.  You know, that's I mean, the bigger man.

But my only complaint is that I have to wait on hold and listen to the shows every time I make a prank.  And so I made this little song to vent to you this week.  Check it out.  I listen to these shows while I'm waiting on hold.  Well, they even take my call, only God really knows.  I'm telling you, everyone, it's never, never, never.  Listening is never fun.  It's my only complaint ever.  Anyways, check out the Patreon episode.  We've got a wonderful JJ call on there.  Great JJ content.  Also a little bit of Tom Gully and the Notorious Frog call.  You don't want to miss it.  You don't want to.  Trust me.  Go over there.  Check it out if you can afford it.  Give a little bit.  It's how we support the channel and how we keep going.  Bye.  I'm the host.  Bye.  He understands you, devil, with his puns.  And the end of the night is an ocean. ",
