This is going to be one of the biggest factors in this.  And ambition matters, my man.  Ambition matters.  The super chat says, simp behavior has fours thinking like nines shaking my head.  Exactly.  Exactly.  So the simp behavior he's talking about, right, is the guys that are just thirsting online or texting or on Instagram just giving her all these likes.  Like these things, guys, I still see it and it's so shocking.  It's like... These girls that post what they're called is thirst traps.  They'll post like the picture of them in the bikini or whatever.  And then they'll do like their little like corny inspirational line.  I just saw one today of this girl that is about to hit the wall, kind of in the transition of hitting it.  And you can tell she's self-conscious about it.  She posted a picture of before when she was in her bikini at a different state by a pool and it was all warm.  She posts it with this inspirational message.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Thinking of the sun.  Wish I was back in Cali.  It's like... She's posting this old picture, this old thirst trap up there with the, and I saw, and again, this was just like a normal girl.  She had like 243 likes.  And I'm just looking at that, like every guy that did that is increasing this, it's like that simp behavior.  Every guy that just feeds into that, where I just look at that stuff, I'm just like, you're just doing that just for the likes and the comments and that cheesy inspirational message.  I refuse to like a picture like that.  But what she said just there, and let me rewind that like five seconds just to hear what their goal is.  And this is, again, one of the fall of relationships.

            "text": "Right there, guys.  You guys heard that.  Their biggest goal is like, hey, if you're a girl and you want to get to... You want to get to the hottest parties, the after parties with the hottest guys, the D1 athletes.  The D1 athletes are the mega Chad and the mega Tyrones, the guys that are in these peak muscular shape.  They've got the peak confidence because they know they own the campus and all that.  And what happens is what she's saying here, again, right, guys, is all of the girls that are below sevens, And I don't know how these girls would rate seven and whatever.  But just think about that.  All the girls that are below sevens, they're getting this advice to leech on to the hottest friend you have so that you can sneak in there to these after parties.  Where you can experience the D1 Mega Chad and Mega Tyrones as long as you are one of those girls and you know your place.  And you know that you're going to have to be available for the gangbang.  You're going to have to be available for getting ran train on for these guys.  Because then they'll be like, all right, yeah, yeah, sure.  We'll throw Cassie in here.  Yeah, come on over here, Cassie.  It's like that idea, right?  These girls are just like... sneaking their way into these parties just to get a shot at these higher status men that in reality they know they wouldn't have a shot with.  But again, that is the whole problem with it is that they taste these guys and they're like, dang, dang, I just got the starting cornerback for my college football team.  Now when Billy from online dating messages me and he seems like a nice guy who would probably be a great loyal husband to me, she's like, I wanna go back with the star of the football team.  And she chases that high that she's not gonna be able to get again.  But again, when she online dates, she keeps searching for that same type of high.  And then as she's doing this, she gets all these simps that will take her to these really nice restaurants, that will fly her in his private jet, that will do the little like, I'm gonna walk you out and do this candlelit dinner, the romantic guy.  They have all of the different subtypes of guys that they just keep dating around looking for one of these mega Chad or mega Tyrones because their hypergamy believes they tasted it once, they should be able to get it again.  So she searches, searches, searches, and then all of a sudden the matches dry up.  The eggs dry up.  The attention dries up.  And then she looks around.  Life is unfair because of men.  They have fed me this lie that I should care about my body and that my only worth is sex, right?  They spin this whole game again on men and then they're unhappy.  and then they hit 30 and they're like, I deserve a good man.  I deserve a real man.  I deserve a man that will treat me right.  like a queen.  Goes all the way back to exactly what Ambition Matters just said, what I saw somebody say in the chat, what CGA, Coach Gary Adams says, a 49er, it's a four that believes she's a nine.  It's exactly that.  Because of advice like this, the women sneak in and they get a taste of something that they're never gonna realistically find again and again.  their hypergamy will not let versus guys take the difference.  let's just take a guy that says your guys will be so much more realistic and modest about this.  it's like take the guy that maybe thinks of himself as not the highest status man and he landed some smoking hot babe.  maybe he was just super charming one night in him and in his head he's like dude she's out of my league.  right guys will actually admit to something like that.  so if he tasted something like that for a night and it's not like that guy walks around going i am never going to settle with anyone other than that.  you know she.  better be that or better.  and guys don't think the same way.  guys don't have hypergamy so it's totally different.  but this right here to me is the fall of relationships is again the false sense of being able to attain mega chad mega tyrone or even regular Tyrone in your local area because of online dating apps and social media.  Oh, yeah, man, I actually had... So I had... Oh, man, there's this girl that... It's sad, man.  Um, but you see, when you, when you hang out with certain people, especially I was in a fraternity, so I would have different groups of people that would be in with different groups.  You'd have the people that, you know, know the athletes, whatever.  they know that, and you would hear certain stories and, or you'd hear reputations.  It's like, there's this girl that I went to, she was from my rival high school from growing up here.  And we went to the same college and And before going to college, she was like a good girl or theoretically a good girl, but you would assume, but she wasn't like a party girl.  Totally changed.  And she doesn't look the same at all.  This girl, I've seen her, you know, around town every once in a while here.  But in college, I had heard that she had the nickname come dumpster.  Her nickname was come dumpster because what she would do is she would wait till really late at all the athlete parties.  And again, we were at a division one school.  So she would wait for all, you know, at the athlete parties, she would always hang around towards the end and she would get really drunk or whatever.  And she would be one of these girls that like, again, she thought her value was just sex and all that stuff.  And apparently, and to me, it's sad to think about this, but this was her nickname.  People would walk around, especially the athletes, and they would see her and they would labor, oh, that's cum dumpster.  Because apparently she would get to the point where she'd be drunk enough.  she would get trains ran on her and get all this different group sex on that stuff where she was basically the only girl and she would say I'm a cum dumpster fill me up fill me up.  and that was like her line that she would get to when she gets super drunk and that became her reputation and the way that she lived.  dude that girl is not even close to the same person as she was and I grew up knowing her and see her now totally different thing man that She fell into that whole D1 mega Chad mega Tyrone life and it's not soothing her well.  It's just not. ",
