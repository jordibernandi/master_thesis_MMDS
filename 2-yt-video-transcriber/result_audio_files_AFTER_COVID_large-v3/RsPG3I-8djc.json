            "text": "Okay, I just want to read this quickly.  A few people had written in after you made a statement regarding being born again.  And so this is from somebody, one of them.  And he says, this is just part of his email.  The last broadcast, you said something that really was out of line with the basic teaching of Scripture.  Maybe I did not understand the context of what you were saying, but I am sure there are many others who would think the same thing.  After you said that, I just turned off watching, to be honest.  You said that there are those that say, if you are not born again, you will go to hell.  You then said that this is completely unscriptural, implying that those who are not born again will not go to hell. ",

            "text": "I did say that, and you were pretty... small-minded to switch off because this is the problem with Christians.  They don't want to enter or engage in the battle of ideas.  You know, we want to keep these cliches within us and as I've spoken of before, we become irrelevant because of cliches.  Let me explain to you why I said that.  If somebody walked over to me and said, I am born again, does that mean that he's saved or the fruit of his life?  That determines whether he is, in fact, born again.  I wasn't saying that if someone is not born again, they're going to go to heaven or vice versa.  What I'm saying is, there's a cliche issue here.  And in other words, I could just... Be like any religion, just repeat a few words and suddenly I'm saved.  That was the context of it.  Now sit still and don't move so I can teach you what I do believe.  So you can really get some really good teaching.  When Jesus spoke to Nicodemus, first and foremost, it was before he died on the cross.  So now you've got to understand this is pre-cross, pre-crucifixion, pre-salvation, pre-blood, everything.  Pre-veil, not pre-veil, but pre-veil.  renting into and the Ark of the Covenant and all that.  Before that, Nicodemus as a ruler of the law, Remember now, Christ is not yet crucified.  Even though he was crucified before the world began.  I understand that.  But the act hadn't taken place in time and space.  So Nicodemus' question is, I know that you're a man of God.  You could never do these things if God wasn't for you.  Which is not altogether true, by the way.  Because they just took signs.  A lot of them were just signs.  He says, these signs you could not do unless God is with you.  Jesus says to him, Nicodemus isn't asking for anything, but he wants to become, he wants the same life that Jesus has, the same manifestation of life and the same reign and rulership.  So, Jesus says, I say to you, unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.  What I'm saying is, put salvation out of the way.  Nicodemus, according to the law, is saved.  Otherwise, you're telling me that everybody prior to Christ was going to hell.  No, he provided a way for salvation for the Jews and for the Gentiles if they did what he commanded.  So... A Jew, a ruler of the law, pre-crucifixion, pre-new covenant, is asking him, I want this life that you have.  So Jesus says, you've got to be born again to see the kingdom of heaven.  He didn't say to get saved.  According to Jesus, Nicodemus is saved.  He'll go to the bosom of Abraham, Paradiso, paradise, and wait until Christ hits the captive free.  That's what it was all about.  Why do we get so stuck on our cliches?  And so he says, if you want to see the kingdom, you must be born again.  So let's keep in context with the kingdom because while Jesus walked the earth, he said to people, the kingdom is near you.  When somebody asked him a question and it was filled with hunger and thirst for the kingdom, he'd say, the kingdom is near you.  Now what does that mean?  It means the kingdom is there for you to enter, but you cannot enter it until you see it.  And then after his crucifixion and resurrection, he said the same things.  Paul taught the same things.  He commits or practices these sins, and he mentions the nine specific sins, shall not enter the kingdom.  That has nothing to do with salvation.  Because if that were the case, every one of you will not enter heaven.  Because everyone's going to be greedy at one stage.  Somebody's going to tell a lie or be impatient or whatever, anger and that.  So if you take it within the context, of the kingdom while you're on the earth.  I want to enter the kingdom now.  Nicodemus wasn't saying when I die one day, he said, I want what you have now because I see it's absent within the Jewish community.  So that's why he said that.  Jesus said, you have to first of all, see the kingdom.  And the way that you do that is you are born again.  Of course, it speaks about salvation as well.  But salvation is the kingdom of God.  If you exclude the kingdom of God from salvation, all you're doing is waiting until the day that you die, which most people don't want to do, to get to heaven so they can receive the kingdom.  Daniel even said, he said, There are people that are coming who will receive the kingdom and possess the kingdom.  He wasn't talking about people beyond death.  He was talking about people on this earth.  And that's a spiritual kingdom he was speaking about.  Now, so Nicodemus says to Jesus, how can a man be born when he is old?  Can he enter the second time in his mother's womb and be born?  So the guy is completely clueless.  Not only can he not see the kingdom, he cannot see a lot of things.  And then he said, Jesus answered, Moses said, I say to you, unless one is born of water and of the spirit, birth, natural life, water, and of the spirit, that means a spiritual birth.  In other words, when the water breaks in a woman and a child is born, that is natural birth.  But there's a second birthing and that is the kingdom of God.  He says, which is the spirit, unless those two things happen naturally.  You cannot enter heaven.  No, the kingdom of God.  What does it say about the kingdom of God?  Five things.  You seek the kingdom.  You, what's it?  Seek the kingdom and then you see the kingdom that you seek.  And then you enter the kingdom that you saw.  Then you possess the kingdom that you entered.  And then you inherit the kingdom that you possessed.  On earth, why should you be going to heaven and start possessing the kingdom?  So all of this, you've got to take it in that context and not switch off your thing and say, well, I'm not listening because I didn't say exactly what a lot of fundamental preachers say.  If you say you're born again, you're on your way to heaven.  No, there's a lot more to it than that.  I want to possess the kingdom of God.  I want the Holy Spirit to come upon me and teach me how to pray.  This is all kingdom stuff.  So then he goes on to say, that which is born of flesh is flesh.  So that's you.  That which is born of spirit is spirit.  So we have the spirit that comes alive, of course, in Christ.  Now, remember he told him this before he died on the cross.  Now, I want to take you quickly to second P, just to answer your question because you represent the people.  This person also said, by the way, I'm not upset with you because the person that wrote apologized, but P said, oh, there's probably most of your followers that have turned off.  I'm sorry to tell you this, but we've actually increased.  So the whole thing is you've got to stop judging because I don't give a cliche.  I don't just say, oh, I'm saved.  Well, how do I know that you're saved?  Well, I believe Jesus is Lord.  Well, the devil does, then bows his knee and trembles.  So we've got to watch out for a whole bunch of people that are saying things, but they've never actually had the experience of being born again, which means what?  You saw the kingdom and that kingdom you entered because the king led you into that kingdom.  Now, 1 Peter 1, and this is what it says, verse 19.  We are saved.  And of course, I'm not against the word saved.  But again, we have determined what saved is.  If they don't curse, they don't drink, they speak in other tongues or whatever, then they must be saved.  Again, you're wrong.  Because God is more merciful than we are.  He knows what somebody says before they die.  Their one cry can cause salvation to come to them.  So he says, but you are washed.  You're not redeemed with corruptible things like silver or gold from your aimless conduct received by the tradition of your fathers.  And a lot of people are not understanding because they are so stuck on the traditional way of believing.  Again, I say it to you.  You must be born again to see the kingdom of God.  That's all he said.  You must follow him.  To be a follower of Christ is more important than these cliches.  Born again is a beautiful experience.  Listen to what it says.  And so that you were redeemed with the precious blood of Christ, a redemption came through the blood, and a lamb without blemish and without spot.  That's him.  He indeed was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you.  Now what's interesting is he says, Peter says... what, how many, 1900 years or so ago, he says, in these last times, in these end times, and thousands of years have gone by, 1,800 years have gone by, and we're still calling it the last times or the end times.  Well, it is, but the end times is not the last few years.  It could be hundreds of years.  And so that's another cliche we get stuck in.  And he says, Now that's another issue I can get right into now.  How do they purify their souls?  In doing what?  Obeying the truth.  The purification of the soul comes by the obedience to the truth.  What is truth?  Your word is truth.  So if you are obeying the word, that means you are obeying the truth, that is evidence that you are saved.  If you're demonstrating the kingdom, you have been born again because you've entered the kingdom of God on the earth.  Am I making sense here?  I hope so, because I think it's very important.  people understand that I do believe in the rebirth.  Of course I do.  But I don't believe in... There's so much more that happens than that.  Since you have purified your soul, you're doing what?  Obeying the truth.  You purify your soul by obeying the truth.  Through the Spirit, which means the truth that comes to you in your lifetime as well.  Raymer would.  In sincere love of the brothers.  Oh, Kim, I thought I could just be born again.  No, he says the purification of soul comes by obeying the truth in the spirit, sincere love for your brothers.  You tell me you're born again, but you don't have sincere love for your brothers.  You've got a problem.  I'll question that then.  And that you love one another fervently with a pure heart because you've been born again.  In other words, he's saying all of this is evidence that you're born again.  Not of corruptible seed, which is where he says you're born of the water, which is man, but of incorruptible seed through the word of God, which lives and abides forever.  Are you born again?  Kim, I think so.  No, no, no.  You've got to know so.  The evidence is that you see from a kingdom perspective and you enter those things that you see during your life and you demonstrate it.  The demonstration is the obedience to the truth, loving of your brothers, loving each other with pure love and walking in that truth. ",
