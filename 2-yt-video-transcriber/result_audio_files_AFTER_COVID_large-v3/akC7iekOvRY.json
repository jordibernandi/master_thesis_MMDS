            "text": "You need to write it on your citations that you search.  Shut up.  Walk away because you're going to be arrested for interfering.  Thank you.  Hello, I'm Jordan.  Hey, Mark.  Where's the screen?  Stop talking to the cops.  Stop talking to him.  It ain't going to help you.  He's just building a case against you.  stop talking to him.  really man.  gun out bro.  yes sir mr miller gun out you're.  you're a fucking pussy man.  you need a hug man.  i'll give you a hug if you need to feel safe bro.  Thank you for not pulling your gun out on the passenger.  Yeah, tell him you're scared.  Tell him they need to send some cops out that aren't going to pull their guns on somebody doing fucking whatever he was doing.  Do you have an ID on you, sir?  But he don't have to ID, right?  Is he under arrest?  Is he under arrest, jackass?  Hey, Suarez, answer the question.  Is he under arrest, yes or no?  So does he have to ID if he's detained?  Yes, sir.  He does?  You're a dumbass motherfucker.  Call a supervisor.  Give him a... No, no, no, no.  You're lying to him.  You're lying to him, sir.  He don't have to ID unless he's arrested.  You know that, dumbass.  By the way, you don't have to ID unless you're under arrest.  And you're not under arrest for shit.  Yeah, I just like to comply.  Well, fuck that.  Comply's gonna get you shot.  Yeah, comply's gonna get you shot.  Watch.  Look at him all.  Hey, you can go back to patrol.  You can go back to patrol, man.  He's cool.  He ain't gonna pull his gun out no more.  You really think I'm a cop?  Nah.  Look at my YouTube channel.  And you can comply if you want.  That's cool.  That's cool if that's what you feel you need to do.  But just so you know, if you're not under arrest, you don't have to ID.  And don't talk to him.  Stop talking to him.  That's what I told him.  Stop fucking talking to him.  They all know who I am.  Question.  Because he doesn't know the answer.  Do you have to identify yourself if you are being detained and not under arrest?  Like this guy right here, does he have to identify himself if he is only being detained and not under arrest?  He's only being detained?  Detained.  No, he's not.  Yeah, the officer said, so the officer said, give me your ID.  And I said, hey, does he have to give you an ID?  Is he under arrest?  Yeah.  He's being detained.  I said, well, so he has to give it to you, and he says yes.  So he lied to him about getting his ID.  Okay, well, I just got here.  I don't know what's going on.  I just wanted to see if one officer knew the correct answer because he doesn't.  Can you let him know that?  Yeah.  So he can just give him back his ID because he didn't want to give it.  Okay.  It's just not proper.  Let me see what's going on.  He probably needs to give him his ID back.  He didn't want to give it, and the only reason he gave it is because he lied to him.  So can we just get that right?  Awesome.  I appreciate that.  Oh, well, you're not sheriff anyway.  No.  No wonder.  I just got here.  We got dispatch here.  They already, you know, conducted a traffic stop.  We're just here to make sure everything's good.  I get it.  We're about to take off.  I get it.  So, I get it.  So, we're here.  We're what?  Yeah, this guy right here.  He's the one that they said.  Like, these guys are SAPD.  Yeah, because he didn't want to.  You ain't going to talk to the sheriff.  I thought you were sheriff.  But, golly, it's bright.  Who's the supervisor?  Your supervisor?  Why do I got to stand back over there?  I'm just asking you to wait, sir.  Okay.  I have a question, so.  Okay.  Well, my back is turned to you, and that makes me a little uncomfortable.  Well, turn around.  Well, you need a hug?  So you can feel safe.  Come on, we got five officers here.  Do you know who I am?  I don't really care, sir.  I know, but do you know who I am?  Yes or no?  I don't care, sir.  I know you don't care.  Can you stand back over there, please?  Oh, you're the one that did the MIP on the two, and you searched them, and then you wrote that you didn't search them.  Dakota, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Dakota what?  She doesn't like me.  Well, you guys didn't do anything.  They did.  Okay, I will talk to you over there, but let me talk to my officer right here.  Okay.  Okay, wait over there, please.  When you're done.  Come on, man.  You know what I'm going to do.  I'm just going to film her.  But Cody did a MIP on two people.  Let's go talk over here.  Yeah, let's go talk.  I'm glad I ran into you.  So quick question.  Let me deal with him first, and then I'll talk to you.  Oh, that was tricky.  All right, no problem.  So what are you all doing over here, man?  Nah, oh, so we was just trending over there, and I guess some guy just came and asked me if I could leave or whatever.  A random guy walked up to y'all.  Yeah, you should never answer questions because what you're doing is you're fucking him.  I forgot what it was called, but it's like a trend, I guess.  Like a trend, you know what I'm saying?  A trend?  Yeah.  A trend?  I don't know what a trend is.  Like, you know, like... Like you don't have to help them with their investigation.  Yeah, like that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How do you know this guy?  Oh, that's that's my that's my cousin.  That's your cousin?  Yeah.  All right.  You gonna talk to me to Cody?  That's what I thought.  Run away, run away.  She knows I got all kinds of questions for her.  Anyway, before she interrupted.  So she got called by an off-duty deputy who was working at the theater, right?  And what they do is if somebody pulls into the back parking lot, when she's bored, she'll sit there and wait for the call.  And he'll call her on the phone.  And she runs over there real quick.  Everybody out of the car, hands on the hood, searches them.  She don't write shit down.  She don't find nothing.  Get the fuck out of here.  That's what she tells me.  She don't write nothing.  You know the problem with that.  And that's just the beginning.  I've been following her for a little while.  I've never actually met her face-to-face, though.  Okay.  Just been covertly following her and watching her stops and things like that.  So she does searches without consent.  But she writes that she got consent.  Or she just searches and lets him go without writing anything.  She's a bad one.  And this dude right here, this dude tells this dude, Well, actually, he told me that, yeah, if you're being detained, you have to give ID.  And you said, no, you don't, right?  Because that's the correct answer.  Is that you or you?  It was me.  It was you.  Yeah, and you know that too, right?  The only time I have to give you identification is if I'm under arrest.  You're detaining me for something?  I should probably just shut up until you're done figuring out if I committed a crime or not.  Right?  It's always okay to comply and give it to them.  Nothing wrong with that, but I don't.  Once they're done, we'll get your ID back real quick.  What about my cousin?  Like I said, I don't know.  Was your cousin the one driving?  Huh?  Was your cousin the one driving?  No.  I mean, when y'all first came, that's when we got into the car and it was legal again.  I tell you, man, the problem with talking to the police is if he talks to him and your stories don't match, He's fucked.  You're not going to jail.  Yeah, no, no, no.  He'll tell you everything.  Yeah, I know.  But I'm just saying, generally speaking, when you're like, let's say you say, oh, he's my friend.  Well, what's his name?  And let's say you only know him by his nickname.  And that's all.  you know him by.  And you're actually telling the truth.  And you say, and they're like, well, that's not his name.  So he's not your friend, is he?  Well, really, he is, but now they're saying you're lying, all because you just know him by your name.  You see?  They're not trying to help you, man.  They're not trying to help you.  They're trying to get your face.  Did you have anything?  you didn't get out of the vehicle?  Uh, no.  What about charging?  Yeah, if you want to grab it out of the vehicle, the vehicle's going to get towed.  Correct the driver.  Yes, sir.  You check with the property owner and make sure that they didn't allow that?  This is private property.  Oh, this is going to be good.  Man, got to get the owner of the property.  Unless you got a written declaration that y'all can enforce trespassing, which y'all don't.  Not on this one.  Yeah.  All right, guys, so this is private property.  They have not checked with the owner.  If they did, they'd find out that they have permission to be here.  Bro, he didn't see this car doing shit.  And we got that all on camera.  Now, we ain't trying to support any kind of breaking the law, but we are here to catch when an officer stops a car that wasn't doing nothing and says he was reckless driving and we got it on camera.  He wasn't.  Officer might have saw a car, but it wasn't that one.  It was not that one.  It's okay.  You guys are cool.  Yeah, you guys are out of this.  You can't be given a ticket or you can't be taken to jail for reckless driving on private property.  As long as you're putting other people in danger.  Who's the complainant?  I'm sorry?  Who's the complainant?  You don't need a complainant.  You don't need a complainant?  Okay.  Not if you're not for reckless driving.  Who was in danger?  Who was in danger?  Anybody else that he may have been doing the donuts around.  Who?  Because that's what's going to be asked in court.  To my understanding is what was going on from the calls that we had, we had calls for over 20 cars that were out here doing donuts.  So what I would imagine the situation would have been was that whoever is doing donuts was putting the other people in the area in the same parking lot at danger because if you lose control of the car, You wreck into somebody else, or God forbid you lock somebody's leg off, or you run into them while you're doing that.  That's how you put people in danger of doing reckless driving.  That's like saying you could throw handcuffs on me because I'm armed and I might shoot you.  And you might as well just put handcuffs on me and charge me with murder because that's possible, right?  We could go down rabbit holes all day.  It's possible.  Y'all aren't going down the rabbit hole.  We're not.  That's the call we got.  Yeah.  And when we got here, you know, we saw.  Y'all would have probably pulled over a car that y'all saw doing that.  Right.  Yeah.  And that would be totally okay.  We've done that before.  And that would be totally cool.  And I've seen you guys already over the past month do that.  Right.  Like, like, legitly pull over cars that are breaking the law.  And I don't say shit to y'all.  I don't walk off on you.  I just film.  I say thank you and I have a nice night.  But whenever I see the cop get out with a gun pointed at him at a car that wasn't doing nothing, I got a problem with that.  You know what I'm saying?  That's what I got a problem with.  You understand?  If you're doing your job, I got no problem with you.  Like, I'm not giving you a hard time because, you know, you didn't answer the photo ID question correctly.  So I got no reason to give you a hard time.  And I have no doubt that you guys would have... Well, I know Shaw.  I know who Shaw is.  I don't know who you are.  I've seen you out often.  So I know you guys, you know, I have no reason to doubt that you guys would have only pulled over somebody or made a stop on somebody you saw break a law.  That's not what he did.  So that's why I got the issue with him.  So that's all.  Hey, you got a video?  Huh?  Where he was doing donuts?  Who wants it?  Tell him.  Yeah, I know you got the video.  The only way I'll give you my video off my camera is slap you upside the fucking head with it.  Then you can download it that way.  He knows better than to ask me.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Well, just in case, just in case you're as stupid as you look and you want my video, there's only one way to get it.  I'll download it to your fucking head.  Okay, that's good.  Because then I'd have to go to jail after I download it.  And Dakota, you need to stop searching people illegally without consent.  You need to write it on your citations that you searched.  Shut up.  Walk away because you're going to be arrested for interference.  How am I interfering?  Where do you want me to stand?  Where do you want me to stand?  You just came over here yelling at us as we're trying to deal with this.  It was a mistake.  I thought that y'all wanted my video.  No, if you wanted to ask me a question, do it in a polite manner.  Okay.  So it's not my speech that's interfering.  It's what I'm saying.  It's the fact that you come over here yelling at us.  I wasn't threatening.  I was just letting you know.  I let you know if you wanted my video, there's only one way you could get it.  You can go stand over there if you'd like.  But you're not going to want my video, so there's nothing that's going to happen, right?  Okay, then stop talking.  I don't have to stop talking.  Hey, you're going to stop.  Let us do what we need to do, okay?  That's all we're asking.  I'm not... Do what you got to do.  I'm just filming.  Did you find it?  I'm getting it right now.  I'm going to do the... Okay.  He didn't see that car do shit.  We got that on video.  That car didn't do nothing.  Y'all can't take out your dash camera or anything like that?  He didn't see it.  How about you call a supervisor?  Because I had that car on camera the whole time.  He made contact with you, right?  I had that car on camera the whole time.  You were in the car when he made contact with you guys?  Yeah, I was in the car.  No, I saw him.  You know what?  Call 335-6000.  Tell him to get a supervisor out here because I got video that that car didn't do shit and he's a liar.  Would you like to be a willing witness and allow us to see the video?  I'll let your supervisor see the video and to show that you're lying. ",
