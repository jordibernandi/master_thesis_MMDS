They're doing this by showing that he told the proud boys to, quote, stand back and stand by, unquote, which did sound like a wait and see order.  Problem is the proud boys are not white supremacists, but, you know, the left never wants to let facts interfere with their narratives.  So who are these guys?  The Proud Boys come out of a Gavin McGinnis joke with a staff member at his comedy show.  Here's Anthony Cumia of Opie and Anthony fame telling Joe Rogan how it started. ",

And just like Fight Club, the Proud Boys spread all over the place, and there was nothing that McGinnis could do to control it.  Why?  Because the progressives running Twitter and Facebook and YouTube deplatformed him.  They made him a martyr while making sure that he could no longer control the direction of the Proud Boys.  But they have kept to the role of protector, and all races are welcome.  As he has made clear, his little men's club started fighting Antifa after they were attacked and he was pepper sprayed by Antifa.
