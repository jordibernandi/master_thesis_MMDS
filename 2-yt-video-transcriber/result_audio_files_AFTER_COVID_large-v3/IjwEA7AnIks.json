            "text": "Yeah, that's a good question.  I think colorblind is really something that people love to say.  I was watching a trailer for a movie that's coming out, The Hate U Give.  I'm really excited about that movie and also afraid to see the movie, but in one of the scenes of the trailer, the romance between the young black girl and the white male is like, he says, like, I don't see color.  I just see people for who they are.  And she says something along the lines of, if you fail to see my blackness, you fail to see me.  If you don't see my color, if you just see a blank canvas, then you don't understand the struggle that I go through every day.  You don't understand the fear I see or the fear I feel when I see a police officer interchanged with the safety and the protection that you feel.  And I think that's the hardest part is that, the lack of understanding and the idea that colorblind or color neutral or whatever they wanna call it is, is ignorance.  It's to ignore struggles that I face every day, struggles that Black people face every day.  And I think that's what makes it hard because then it's a whole other conversation.  But if I say, don't be, like, see me, all of me, and I'm not just a woman, I am a black woman and a part of my identity is that I am black.  And so that means a few different things than your experience as a non-black woman.  That means that, you know, you see a police officer walking down the street and you feel safe, you feel protected.  And I don't.  I feel afraid.  I feel uneasy.  I feel anxious.  And that has to do directly with my black identity.  And it's not a coincidence or some force that has nothing to do with what my skin color looks like.  It's because of that.  I feel these things because I am a black American, woman, male, what have you.  I am a black person living in America.  And that means a few things.  So to say that you're colorblind is almost insulting.  It almost disrespects the fight that I go through every day.  I walk around and I'm afraid, I'm uneasy, I'm all of these things.  And to say, ah, I don't see that is to say that you don't see those other things.  I don't see your fear.  I don't see your anxiety.  I don't see your uneasiness.  I just see a person and the rest of that stuff kind of doesn't matter.  And that's not okay with me. ",
