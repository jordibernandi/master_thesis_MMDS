Hello all, welcome to the Truth Show.  In this video, I will be talking about the strained relationship between Suzette and Selena Quintanilla.  This is something that was brought to my attention.  You know, Selena's birthday is coming up in April and I think something just got released.  I don't remember what it was.  Anyway, she's just been on my mind lately and it's something that I really wanted to do a long time now.  Let's talk.  Here we go again.  I mean, this is a true show.  Oh, and there's more.  Oh, I'm not done yet.  Oh, and there's more.  Oh, I'm not done yet.  I mean, this is a true show.  Oh, yes.  It has come to my attention that there was some tension between Suzette and Selena Quintanilla.  Now, I'm not talking about just some sister fighting and background.  No, this went really deep.  Like, I know you're my sister and I love you.  I will miss you.  But I slightly hate that.  I'm glad you're gone.  Because now I shine, unfortunately, on your expense.  Now, in order for me to explain to you, we have to go back.  You see, I read in Chris's book, To Selena With Love.  Beautiful book, by the way.  Anyway, it was on page 9 and 10, whereas it stated that Chris... used to hang around Suzette more.  They were really close.  At this point, Selena and Chris were just bandmates.  Selena was the youngest and she was underage at that time.  So Chris saw her that way.  It was reported by a secret source that Suzette had a crush on Chris.  But, you know, like I said, He only saw her as a bandmate and just a fun person to hang out with.  She even cut his hair.  That part was true.  So she was often found laughing at his jokes, you know, and stupid things or compliment the way he played his guitar all the time.  But again, Chris only saw her as a friend, nothing more.  Oh, and you know that scene with Abraham snapping at Chris?  That happened more than once.  Abraham and Suzette didn't want this in the movie because they didn't want to be portrayed too negatively.  So it was told that upon hearing that Selena and Chris may have been messing around, Suzette was devastated and was often agreeing with her father in trying to break them up.  Oh, yes.  Chris described in his book between pages 71 and 73 in the book stated this is what happened one of the moments that Abraham well actually this was like the first moment that Abraham confronted him about Selena.  this is what he said.

            "text": "Ultimately, it wasn't anything that Selena and I did that brought our relationship to Abraham's attention and brought his wrath down upon us both.  It was her sister, Suzette.  We had just finished playing a show in El Campo, Texas.  Selena and I were hanging out on Big Bertha while the road crew broke down the equipment.  Everyone else was either outside or in the bar as she and I relaxed in the front lounge area of the bus.  We weren't doing anything suspicious.  We weren't even sitting next to each other.  I was seated at the table and Selena sat on the couch across from me.  We had changed our clothes and were just talking when we heard the bus door swing open.  Instinctively, Selena and I both straightened up and fell silent as someone has ascended the steps of the bus.  it was only suzette before i had time to feel relieved and make a joke.  however i saw from suzette's expression that she wasn't pleased to see us as we were to see her.  oh god suzette said.  she rolled her eyes at us then spun around and got off the bus again slamming the door so hard that the bus rocked a little.  selena and i exchanged puzzle glances.  What was that all about?  I asked.  No idea, Selena said.  It never occurred to either of us that Suzette would go to her father at that moment and tell him about us.  Why would she?  Suzette and I had always been friends, like the rest of the band.  She knew about Selena and me.  She had already told us.  Look.  I'm not involved in what you're doing together.  And if dad asks me, I'm going to say that I don't know anything.  A few minutes later, the door to the bus swung open again.  This time it was Abraham.  He climbed the steps but stopped near the driver's seat, staring straight at me.  Chris, can you come here for a second?  He asked.  He appeared calm, but his mouth was set and his voice was hoarse from either fatigue or tension.  Shower.  I got up from the table, alarm bells sounding in my head.  What's going on?  Selena asked.  I shrugged and followed her father.  By the time I reached the top of the bus steps, Abraham was standing on the ground again, just waiting.  His dark eyes were hard and his shoulders were pulled back.  What was going on?  We had performed in Houston the night before.  Abraham had been paid for that show and Kashan had somehow rushed out of the hotel room in the morning without retrieving his briefcase full of money from under the bed.  By the time he remembered, we were already setting up for the show in El Campo, Abraham decided to borrow a car from my friend Carlos, whose band was opening for us that night, so that he could race back to Houston, feverishly hoping that by some stroke of luck the money would still be there.  It was thankfully, still, I reminded myself that this mishap had caused Abraham to miss our show in El Campo.  and had probably made him even more exhausted and irritable that he usually was, particularly since he had nobody to blame for that mistake but himself.  As I joined him on the street, I ticked off every other possible reason that Abraham might feel compelled to call me aside like this.  None of the reasons seemed like good ones.  Had I said or done something to set him off?  Abraham was certainly angry.  He started to walk away, his shoulders hunched forward and his hands balled into fists, thinking.  Oh, man, please don't let him try to do anything.  I followed him toward the back of the bus, where the generator was making a loud clacking sound.  Suddenly Abraham stopped so fast that I nearly ran into him.  He wheeled around and pointed a finger at me.  Suzette just told me that she walked onto that bus and saw you and Selena holding hands.  He said, I don't know what's going on with you guys, but whatever it is, Stops right now, I remain silent as Abraham continued to yell and jab his finger in my direction, trying to intimidate me, and one more thing, he finished, if you say a single word about this conversation to Selena I will deny it and she's going to believe me.  What had made Suzette say something to him?  To this day, I have no idea.  It was probably just a rift between sisters.  Nothing serious, just a bad mood. ",

            "text": "Chris went on to say that he told Abraham he'll stay away from Selena, just to keep the peace.  However, afterwards, he told Selena that Suzette told her father about them, and Selena was ready to go after Suzette.  But Chris stopped her.  Days after that, things were intense, and Suzette and AB was giving him the cold shoulder, especially Suzette.  I mean, AB was just, you know, just trying to not pick sides.  I mean, think about it from Suzette's point of view.  You were always overlooked, heck, by everyone.  And your little sister got all the attention, love and all.  And then she turned around and got married to a dude that you liked.  I read that she married Bill Arriaga, may I mispronounce his last name, a year after Selena married Chris Perez in 1992.  You see, did you all also know that Suzette wanted a career in music even after Selena's death?  And she was starting to pursue it until her father made her work as a manager at Selena's museum.  She once again had to put her dreams on hold.  I was told that Suzette had to stop going to school at some point while they were on the road.  The family don't talk about that, of course, and they kept that out of the movie if you didn't notice that.  Selena and she did fight a lot.  The movie, if you didn't see, made Suzette look like an angelic beacon of hope to And it's a pair of laughs.  That was so far from the truth.  She did support her sister, but not to the extreme that they're making it seem like in that movie.  That was completely false.  And I'm not saying that she didn't love her sister.  I'm sure she did.  And Selena may have thought everything was copacetic and good with her sister, Suzanne.  You know, just occasional... argument.  that's it.  hey if you look at their childhood pictures you will see that at some point suzette was looking like she was sprouting out really nicely but as time went on and she had to constantly put her dreams on the back burner for her sister selena while her brother bee did what they wanted and you know made all of this kind of money.  She had to be more submissive, though, so she ate her feelings.  The famous Selena got, the more Suzette ate, which brings us to where we're at today.  Most of the time, she's wearing black.  Upon Selena getting a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, they purposely didn't ask Selena's last name, Selena Quintanilla Perez, which was her legal name before she passed away.  And her reason for not doing it sounded very bitter.  This is what she said.  Selena get the name birth given name that the world got to know as simply.  Selena will have her Hollywood Walk of Fame star for all to look upon and hopefully remember when I'm gone.  okay she captioned in the video Anyway, then later she posted herself on the exercise bike, claiming to be releasing some emotional buildup.  Now, just reading it, you would think, oh, how sweet.  Well, let's really read it without that mindset, but a neutral and no knowledge of who these people are, okay?  Morning.  Well, today is the day.  Burning off some emotional buildup.  If anyone think this is easy for us, you stand to be corrected, my friends.  I will stand alongside my family and friends and all the super fans that continue to love her and look up to her.  Selena Kourtney at birth, given name that the world got to know as simply.  Selena will have her Hollywood Walk of Fame star for all to look upon and hopefully remember when I'm gone, all of you Buffy.  Watch out, world.  Today belongs to Selena and all who love her.  Now, I'm noticing in some statements, I don't know if she's just paraphrasing it and trying to speak on her sister's behalf by speaking in a second or third person sense, but I'm starting to think that she's starting to think she is her sister, but that'd be a whole nother psychological level.  I have read cases like that, but let me just keep reading here.  Now, just reading it, as I stated, you would say, oh, how darling and sweet and empathize.  But look how it starts off and then ends.  Key words, she refers to her sister as her.  And she say, look up to her.  And then she ends it with a standard answer.  Honestly, it's kind of weird.  But what it sounds to me is like she just gave an answer that everyone expects her to say.  You all have to understand, and I just said this, Suzette had to put her life on hold for her sister.  Even now, it still continues and is the main source of her income now.  Her Instagram is drowned with merch and product about Selena.  I mean, you would start to think that she think herself as Selena at some point.  Like, who is Suzette?  You're living your sister's life, her dreams, even though you are coming across as supporting her sister.  But are you supporting your sister?  Or do you sometimes think you are your sister?  This is your time to shine, even though you're Suzette, but you're doing it on her expense.  I'm just saying.  So even when she's dead, Abraham and his sidekick Suzette is still banking off Selena.  And then they got to nerd to stop Chris Perez from making a little small TV series about his life with his late wife, Selena.  Afraid of the truth?  Huh?  I don't know.  And Abraham being exposed, probably.  I read in this book on how Chris had to pump the brakes, and I said this in the video before about Selena, had to pump the brakes on how much he used to work Selena to death.  And He had to honestly tell him, if you keep this up, you will burn her out.  I also read about the loud arguments.  Selena and Abraham had that left at some point, whereas Selena had collapsed on the floor in tears and frustration, and Selena not able to wait.  Just couldn't wait to get rid of her father as her manager.  Did you all know that?  That she wanted to do that at some point?  Selena was ready to fire her father.  Did you all know that?  Selena, let me say it again, was ready to fire her father prior to her death.  This is what Abraham was afraid of, losing his golden goose to Chris.  Yeah, that's what he's afraid of.  So that's why he tries to black everything Chris does.  It was even reported that Chris had to fight to be in the front row at Selena's funeral.  His wife.  I mean, ridiculous.  I'm starting to think that Abraham, yes, saw Selena as his daughter, and I'm sure he loved her, but mostly he saw her as an investment, a property, and a moneymaker.  He acts and still acts like a godfather.  I mean, the man walk around with his tinted glasses his pinky ring big belly.  he looks like a godfather.  i mean is he mexican or italian?  sometimes i forget.  well that's it.  there isn't anything more.  this is something i always wanted to do.  let me know your thoughts below.  oh and don't forget to subscribe like and share.  hit that bell so you get notifications for when i do post more videos.  love you all bye Yeah.
