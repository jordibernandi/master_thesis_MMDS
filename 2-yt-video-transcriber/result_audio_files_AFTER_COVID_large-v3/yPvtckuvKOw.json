            "text": "Ladies, it's time you stop doing this one thing.  what is up everybody and welcome back to the channel today.  I just had a random thought.  honestly this is something that just been bothering me for a while.  I got no notes written down here.  I'm just going off the top of my head.  honestly I've been single for a while so I don't know you know if you guys know my story if you're new here great I've been single for a while.  I've been single now for probably don't know four years something like that five years.  uh after my divorce i went a little crazy.  i was living in florida and even when i moved back to pennsylvania i spread my seed.  i had a good time.  uh i mean it was like shooting fish in a barrel in florida.  let's be honest man you could pretty much look at a chicken.  go you want to go home and they'd go.  All right, come on, let's go.  So it really wasn't that much of a challenge, but I did my thing after my divorce.  I had a bunch of fun.  I got bored with it and I focused more on my kids.  My kids were starting to get closer to the teenage years, so I knew that that was a big priority for me, that those teenage years are Super, super important for a dad to be around, whether it's a boy or a girl.  I got two girls, though, so it's even more important that I'm a big part of their life right now in these important teenage years.  I took a step back from the dating game.  I fooled around for a little bit, but then even that got boring.  I'm gonna be honest with you guys right now, because that's just the way I am with you.  I honestly don't even know my last day that I got laid.  I mean, we're talking at least a couple years, somewhere in that range.  I don't know, I'm past it.  I've been focusing solely on my business, on my kids, on my life, on getting this house remodeled, on rebuilding this Corvette in the garage.  I got a lot of shit going on that even to try to incorporate, because here's the thing I've learned.  Unless you're paying for it, you really can't have I don't even wanna say, I don't wanna say words here that YouTube will demonetize this video over.  So unless you're paying for it, there's really no way for you to have coitus, if you will, without an investment of a major amount of time.  And that's just something that I don't really have right now.  I'll take that back.  I do have it.  If the right person came along and earned that time from me, I do have it to give.  But here's the problem.  And this is what you ladies need to stop doing.  And you need to stop training these men, these simple weak-minded men, that this is okay.  You ladies need to stop using, and I get this, but you need to stop using your bodies and sexy time pictures and comments and sentences and conversations that lead down that path within minutes of meeting somebody.  I mean, this is like, here's the deal.  I don't give my attention away easy.  I just said that.  You got to earn it.  and I'm not just gonna give it up to you.  I'm not just gonna shower you with affection and attention and tell you how great you are.  I'm not gonna do that.  You gotta earn that from me.  If I see that you're putting in the time and I see that you're putting in the work, I'll give you that back.  I'll give you that support that you're looking for.  But I'm not just going to hand it to you.  And that's a big problem we got right now is too many of the guys just hand it over.  They just hand over the attention.  Oh my God, you're so great.  I love you so much.  Oh, I'm so glad that I met you.  Oh, I can't wait for us to do this and build this life together and all these things.  And they shower these women with attention and affection.  Fake.  affection.  you just met the person.  you can't possibly have real feelings for this person yet.  and when you don't give that to a woman when you don't just shower her and in look I talk in generalizations here because I'm talking about the majority.  all right I've met a lot of women in my life.  I've been on a lot of dates.  I know I have a lot of friends that are single that have been on a lot of dates.  I hear the stories.  they tell these things to me.  they know I'm the guy to talk to about this stuff.  right This is happening everywhere.  This is an epidemic right now.  The second that you don't give these women all the shower of attention that they're used to getting, they're used to these simp guys just filling them with attention.  What's the one thing they have that they go to every single time?  Sex.  Every single time.  And it is quite possibly the biggest turnoff for me, because let me tell you something, and even for you guys that you think it's hard, getting laid right now in 2020, is probably one of the easiest things you could ever do.  It's really not that hard.  And I hate sounding like, you know, I'm not in the best of shape, right?  I got a dad bod.  I'm dealing with my day.  You know what I mean?  But I could easily walk out right now and get laid.  Easily.  It is everywhere.  They're handing it away.  If it was a stock, if their flower was considered a stock, it would be in an all-time low.  Nobody would want it.  It would be sell, sell, sell, sell, sell, and just get rid of it, get rid of it.  Nobody wants it.  Ew, you got that stock?  No, I don't want nothing to do with it.  Ladies, your shit's not valuable.  Maybe to weak men, maybe to soft men, maybe to the guys that are still a slave to getting laid, they put all that value into just simply getting laid.  Like, it's something hard.  I don't comprehend that.  Maybe to some guys it is hard, but if you could just throw out the littlest bit of game and the littlest bit of personality, you can go to any bar right now and pick up a chicken banger.  It's like open season.  I can't stand the second that the conversation starts going to shit like that.  They automatically start, I was just talking here, I'll give you the story.  I was just talking to this girl recently, right?  And I don't match with, I don't really online date hard, okay?  I just don't.  I'm on there a lot for content for this channel.  A lot of the funny videos I put, or pictures I put up in my community section of screenshots of Tinder profiles and things of that nature.  Excuse me, these are real live, profiles from my area.  I'm on there for fun.  Every once in a while, I'll match up with somebody or they'll hit me up with a message and I'll talk to them.  And this girl, we start talking, right?  Turns out, I have a buddy that lives right next door to her, like legit across the street from her.  So what do I do first?  I hit up my buddy.  Hey, man, you ever see this chick outside and about?  Because she's talking about, where do you live?  Where do you live?  I said, oh, I got a buddy that lives over in that area.  Oh, yeah, he's on this street.  And she's like, oh, my God, he just bought that house, right?  That's my neighbor.  So I'm like, bro, what's up with this chick?  First thing he tells me.  Dude, she's outside drinking all the time.  She's got all her friends over all the time.  And she's always just partying.  Party, party, party.  And she's got a little bit of a beer gut.  And I'm like, god damn, bro, these chicks have these beer guts.  It's out of control, ladies.  Get your shit together.  It's okay for a guy, this is gonna sound bad and you ladies don't wanna hear it.  It's okay for a guy to have a few extra pounds on him, especially when he's got his shit together and he's doing the right thing, right?  a chick with a few extra pounds on her starts to get a little shaky.  I don't mind a few extra pounds.  I don't mind a little bit of padding on there.  But when you start getting these guts that hang out over your waist, huh, let's stop, all right?  So then I hear, my buddy's telling me, buddy goes, look, you know, yeah, she's not bad looking, but she got this little beer gut going on.  She's always out there partying.  She's always got her, this chick's 40 years old, 39, something like that.  And you're still, your neighbor who just moved in within the last couple months knows you as the weird 40-year-old chick that just parties and gets drunk and plays beer pong every weekend and sits outside on her stoop on her phone talking about, no, girl, you're the best.  Oh, you're great.  Oh, fuck them.  And just sailor mouth.  That was another thing.  He said sailor mouth, just swearing nonstop and crazy talk.  So this chick, you know, I kind of, I don't show a lot of interest to begin with.  But then I lost even more interest when he told me that.  And what's the first thing she goes to?  I'm going to have to start sending you sexy pictures to keep your attention.  I'm going to have to start talking more, you know, something about like, things of that nature.  It was all sex talk, sex talk, sex talk.  And I'm like, I get it.  A weak mind would fall for that in a heartbeat.  They'd be like, ooh, sex talk.  Ooh, hey, hey, yeah, send me those dirty.  Let's see those things.  Let's see this.  Let's do this.  Let's do that.  Oh my God, I would do this, this, this to you and all this shit, right?  Guys, don't give in to that shit.  If there's one thing I can tell you that I've learned about pulling myself out of the game and staying away from all that bullshit is this.  I put my value somewhere else.  I put my values into a chick who's going to be loyal, who's going to stay with me.  You know what else this chick tells me?  One of the first things she says to me, yeah, I just broke up with my boyfriend like a month ago.  And you're already out there running around.  You're already within a month.  You're already out there looking for monkey branching on to the next dude, which means he broke up with her.  Because if she broke up with him, she'd already have another branch of swing on.  She probably already does.  Let's be honest.  Every chick I know, look, I got a good friend.  She's probably going to start coming on to some podcasts and stuff like that.  I worked with her years ago for a long time.  We have very similar personalities.  We get along very well.  It's hilarious when we get together.  I'm definitely much more funnier, but of course she thinks for some reason that she's hilarious.  She's a little bit of a hot mess, man.  And she'll admit it.  And she's in a slump part in her life.  And she's right at her peak, right at her prime.  She's 29.  And I keep telling her, I'm like, listen, you got to get your shit together.  Because from here on out, it's a downhill slope.  You're going down.  But this chick already has nothing together.  Parents, no.  Her parents are there.  She lives with her parents.  Sorry.  No car.  No job.  No money.  Drinks.  Alcohol.  Smoked cigarettes.  Lottery ticket addiction.  She saw a pile of dudes hitting her up, a pile of them.  It's nonstop.  She tells me all the time about these random dudes hitting her up that she went to high school with, she went to college with, random strangers finding her and just sweating on her.  And I'm like, I told her, I said, it is amazing how much attention a chick can get just simply by looking decent.  I mean, she's good looking.  She's not like drop dead gorgeous, but she's far from ugly.  And just has, but she has nothing going for her.  Absolutely nothing.  And she has a pile of men kissing her ass.  I'm the only one that tells her.  And guess what?  I'm the only one that tells her that she ain't got her shit together.  She needs to stop drinking.  I tell her to shut the fuck up when I need to.  I put her in her place when she needs it.  And guess who she calls all the time?  Guess who she begs for the attention of?  Me.  She ignores all those guys that shower her with attention.  She wants nothing to do with them.  Women don't want that shit, guys.  Stop giving into it.  Stop putting value in sex.  Because I promise you, there's no value in it.  You're better off just paying.  What was that thing that we watched the other day with that guy?  Or the video I just posted up with all the information about his dates?  He would have been better off.  He paid an average of $500 per time that he got laid from going on those 100 dates.  And clearly he wasn't in it to find a lover.  He was doing this to compile data.  Why would you spend $500 per time getting laid and waste all this time on all these dates?  I appreciate you doing it, but that just goes to show you that you literally will waste thousands of dollars, almost $10,000 in dates over a two-year period.  To end up with nothing and to get laid 16 times?  Guys, you're better than that.  I'll see you next time. ",
