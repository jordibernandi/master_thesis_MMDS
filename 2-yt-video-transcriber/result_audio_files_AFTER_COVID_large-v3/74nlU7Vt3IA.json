The court ruled yesterday that the government's policy on expanding the airport was unlawful because ministers had failed to take proper account of how it affected Britain's climate commitments.  This is particularly the Climate Change Act and also the net zero by 2050 carbon emissions pledge.  But a refusal to properly consider the UN Paris Agreement, which limits rises in global temperatures, well, is aimed at limiting rises in global temperatures, was legally fatal, the judges said.  This has a massive knock-on effect for every other airport project in the country, road projects.  rail projects and any energy projects as well.  Government said it would accept the ruling.  It's still not known yet whether or not Heathrow will decide to actually appeal that decision, although very likely that they will.  Well, we'll get the thoughts of Dave Chawna and Russell Quirk on that in just a couple of moments.  First up, though, let's talk to Caroline Russell, who's London Assembly member and transport spokeswoman for the Green Party.  Good morning to you, Caroline. ",

But even a project like HS2, which is rail travel, which Greens are supposed to be in favour of, as opposed to road or air travel, even that could be hit under this Court of Appeal ruling yesterday, which would suggest that anything... that contributes to more carbon emissions could be ruled unlawful under the current terms on which the government is allowed, within its own terms now, to behave.  We've got China.  By 2025, China is planning to build 137 whole new airports.  Now, I'm not saying we want to be like China.  It's a totalitarian state.  They don't care about things like planning permission or pollution and things like that.  But... There must be some middle ground between, you know, insisting, for instance, on quieter aeroplanes, on fewer emissions, on limiting the times, which could be done around Heathrow Third Runway, that would allow us the economic expansion that that would entail and the economic boom and the jobs, but wouldn't have such a major impact on pollution.
