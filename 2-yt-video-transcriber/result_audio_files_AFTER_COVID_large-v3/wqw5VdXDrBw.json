I really thought that when Andrew Yang came out on stage at 10 o'clock at night, he brought an energy and you could feel the energy in this room.  Now, granted, we're on a college campus, but this room wasn't full of college kids.  It was full of New Hampshire Democrats with college kids here as well.  And I just thought that how he came out and his approach to answering questions.  In fact, I turned to somebody backstage when he was out there and I said, gosh, You know, when we first met Andrew Yang and we had our first town hall with him, you know, last year, it could have been around this time.  I forget.  It's all the same day now to me.  But God, he has changed.  His personality has changed.  Look at him there.  He was not like that a year ago.  His personality is now popping. ",

But he is the youngest... acting and i don't mean in an immature way.  but he is uh the youngest acting person.  he has the most the best way to put it the most youthful even though he's not the youngest in age mayor pete budaj is but he is the most youthful of all the candidates who are in there.  right yeah one ",

He may have not won any votes, but Andrew Yang won the night.  And if I owned any company in the world, I would try to hire him.  I would have no idea what to do with him.  But I know that he would make my company better.  He's really smart.  He was up here talking about statistics, opioid statistics, crime statistics.  I mean, he was talking about world health.  I don't know.  I was like, where do you where do you have space in your brain for everything you're talking about?  He had me with the getting rid of pennies.  That was definitely, I am totally serious.  He seems like the candidate having the most fun.  At least he's enjoying it.  Put the money in our head. ",
