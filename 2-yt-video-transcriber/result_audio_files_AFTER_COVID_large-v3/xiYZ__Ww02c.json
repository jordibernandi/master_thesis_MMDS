            "text": "You see, a lot of freelance videographers will sell their footage to either CNN or Fox News.  But when you do that, you only get to sell half of what you actually film happening at these events.  You might be able to sell your peaceful protest footage to CNN, but then you're stuck with all this footage of looters rioting.  Which is why I've developed a technique that allows me to sell to both.  They call me the chief because I use every part of the buffalo.  Well, Fox News calls me the chief.  CNN got offended that a white person used the word buffalo.  For example, yesterday, some protesters were antagonizing the police, throwing rocks at them.  Clip that out.  Vintage Fox News.  Then moments later, when the police responded with wildly excessive force, now I have a clip for CNN.  A shopkeeper saying something racist obviously goes to CNN.  The looters robbing him blind five minutes before Fox News.  Last week, black protesters talking about how they're fighting oppression.  Classic CNN.  But then when he goes on to say that's why black people need the second amendment, chop that puppy up a little something for Fox News.  Sometimes they make special requests.  I had a black cop acting aggressive.  They asked me if I had that in white.  And recently Fox News put a premium on gang members burning flags.  But instead of hitting the streets again, I realized that if I get creative with the titles, I can oftentimes sell the same piece of footage to both organizations without even making any cuts.  For Fox News, I have black protesters beat up white student, and then rename that Freedom Fighters Defend Against Trump Supporter.  For Fox News, I have illegal immigrant attacks baby.  For CNN, I've renamed that clip Dreamer Supports Extremely Late Term Abortion.  I have two distinct folders.  For Fox News, cops being chill, protesters being outrageous.  And for CNN, I have cops being outrageous, protesters being super chill.  I learned that the hard way when I accidentally sent footage of black teenagers cleaning up the streets to Fox News.  They emailed me back saying, what the hell are we going to do with this?  I said, if you play it backwards, it looks like they're littering.  They said, we already tried that.  We don't think it's going to play for our viewers.  I said, I think you'd be surprised.  Cha-ching. ",
