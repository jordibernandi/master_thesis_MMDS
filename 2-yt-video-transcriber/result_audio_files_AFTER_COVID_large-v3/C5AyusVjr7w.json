            "text": "Thank you very much.  I thought I'd start by talking about some mail-in voting that just was revealed, just the news.  Half a million incorrect absentee ballot applications were sent all across the state of Virginia, including to many dead people.  This was an unprecedented mailing flub.  that's heightened concerns about the integrity of expanding mail-in voting and mail-in voting efforts.  It's a disaster.  All over Virginia, half a million votes.  So that's something you have to think about.  We don't want to have a rigged election.  I know that.  And you have to be very careful when you mention, as you constantly do, Russia, or you mention China, or you mention Iran or others that attack our election system.  And when you have this mail-in voting, it's very susceptible.  It's something that can be easily attacked by foreign countries and by, frankly, Democrats and by Republicans.  And I think that it's something you have to start thinking about very seriously.  Our system is not equipped for it.  The post office is not equipped for it.  And people should vote, like they did in World War I and World War II.  And your numbers will be, in 90 days or less, your numbers will be very good, I think, much better on the coronavirus or the China virus.  But it's something you have to look at and say, this is just crazy.  This just came out.  Half a million incorrect ballot applications sent all over the state of Virginia to many people that They weren't living.  They had some sent to pets, dogs.  This is what we're going to get into, and it's going to be a disaster, and it's going to be thought of very poorly.  It's going to hurt our country.  After our news conference Saturday night and the pro-growth announcement, pro-jobs, pro-health safety, Executive orders, the stock market went up 358 points today.  So we issued those executive orders and the stock market went up 358 points today.  It's quite a reaction.  The Dow Jones and the S&P 500 are now up 50% since March.  50%.  Think if you had money in there, if you put your money in in March, you're 50%.  The NASDAQ index continues to set new records.  It's been up over 14 times, new record in NASDAQ.  And the S&P 500 and the Dow, Dow Jones, are going to be, I mean, the way they're going, it looks like they're just about going to be topping records hopefully soon. ",
