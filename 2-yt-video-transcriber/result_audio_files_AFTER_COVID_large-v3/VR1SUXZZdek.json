            "text": "Now in finishing, I would like to say this.  I would like to apologize.  Not for the truths that I have shared.  But this afternoon... Several people came to me.  And they said, Brother Paul, we love the things you preach.  But sometimes you say things very hard.  And I said, well, I'm an American.  But then I said, you know you're right.  I don't regret one thing I've said yesterday or today.  With regard to the truth that is in it.  But I do regret some of the things that I said and some of the ways that I said them.  Sometimes when we're full of passion.  And we want so much for people to change.  That we can sometimes just say things that aren't said in the right way.  And you know this is a good lesson.  I don't care about my reputation.  I just want to be right with God.  And I want to be right with you.  So if I've offended you because I've said something that's in the Bible, I don't apologize for that.  But if I have said things the wrong way, and I think sometimes I have, I ask you to forgive me for that.  Because again, the only thing I want is to be right with God.  And we will be judged for every word that comes out of our mouth.  You see, everybody has their weaknesses.  Everyone has their failures.  And I most certainly have mine.  But there is so much at stake here.  This is not a game.  I can't just give you a sermon and then go to bed.  Is it not true that it is not well with everyone's souls here?  Some of the things I've said, you know it's true about you.  Please don't leave here tonight.  without setting things right with God.  Don't harden your heart.  Seek Him while He may be found.  Everything depends upon it.  Some of you who are here tonight who have been parents for many, many years, And you've probably had children that have done things that were wrong.  And you stood there just crying out to them, please don't do this, please don't do this, you're going to ruin your life.  That's what the preacher feels every time he gets up in a pulpit.  Follow Christ. ",
