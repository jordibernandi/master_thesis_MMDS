            "text": "How's everybody doing?  My name is Anthony Brian Logan and today we got to talk about Don Lemon arguing with Terry Crews about Black Lives Matter.  Now, Terry Crews said a few things on Twitter that got people really upset, triggered and butthurt.  He was talking about how Black Lives Matter should not morph into Black Lives Better or anything nefarious like that.  And he also said that, look, white people aren't all bad.  Black people aren't all good.  I know that might offend some, but I'm prepared to die on that hill.  And I replied to that.  I was like, look, man, stay the course.  Don't let them take you off.  Stay in your conviction.  And he most certainly did that live on CNN with Don Lemon, who was trying to attack him the whole time.  Now, Don Lemon.  uh funny enough admitted what black lives as i call it l-i-e-s matter is all about.  he's saying look it's not really about black folks getting shot and killed every day in the community by each other.  it's not even about that.  it's about police brutality.  now before i go any further let's roll the clip.  If you want to see the full thing, I'll link to that in the box.  I won't play it right here for time's sake, but I'll play some of what is in that clip right here in this video.  After we get done with that, I'll talk about what both of them said in the clip.  Then I'll give you my two cents, my deep detail analysis, and then I'll wrap it on up with a nice bow on top.  So without further ado, let's go ahead and roll it. ",

It's not mutually exclusive that you care about equality for black people, that somehow you're going to stop random violence or, unfortunately, kids from being shot.  It just seems like apples and oranges. ",

This is the Black America's version of the Me Too movement.  If anything is going to change, we ourselves need to look at our own communities and look at each other and say, this thing cannot go down.  And this is the thing too, there are a lot of great, great people there who are held hostage, who are held hostage by people who literally are running these neighborhoods with violence and then claiming that Black Lives Matter.  When you look at the parents of these little kids who are mentioning saying, hey man, why aren't they speaking up for me too?  And this is what I'm saying.  When I look at this whole thing about, you know, it's about who is controlling the narrative.  It's got to be all Black Lives Matter and what's happened.  is that because I even challenged it, because I even questioned and warned people, I became sick. ",

            "text": "If I told you to wear a mask, they'd want to kick you out.  You're a high-profile person.  You're writing things out there.  You know you're going to get backlash.  You know people are going to respond to what you're saying on Twitter.  I don't think you should be surprised by that.  I have a skin as tough as an armadillo because of what I do, and I think maybe you should adapt that.  But here's what I have to say.  The Black Lives Matter movement was started because it was talking about police brutality.  If you want an all-Black Lives Matter movement that talks about gun violence in communities, including, you know, black communities, then start that movement with that name.  But that's not what Black Lives Matter is about.  It's not an all-encompassing.  So if you're talking about\u2014if someone started a movement that said, cancer matters.  And then someone comes in and says, why aren't you talking about HIV?  It's not the same thing.  We're talking about cancer.  So the Black Lives Matter movement is about police brutality and injustice in that manner, not about what's happening in black neighborhoods.  There are people who are working on that issue.  And if you want to start that issue, why don't you start it?  Do you understand what I'm saying? ",

            "text": "All right.  You saw that.  You heard that.  Now, Don Lemon was just simply trying to defend Black Lives Matter.  How do cool kids say he was trying to cape for Black Lives Matter, trying to be Clark Kent, take off the glasses, put on Superman cape and just fly around defending Black Lives Matter?  Black Lives Matter.  And what he said was wrong.  Before I get to what Terry Crews said, what Don Lemon said was wrong about Black Lives Matter not being about anything other than police brutality.  If you go to their website, which I'll link to in the box below, Black Lives Matter website, they say that they're for a lot more things.  As Terry Crews said, he was like, look, they don't just talk about police brutality.  And when Terry Crews said that Don Lemon cut him off and didn't want him to elaborate, maybe because he knows that what he's saying is true.  Once you go to the website, police brutality is barely mentioned.  Okay.  Matter of fact, I'm not sure if it actually is mentioned specifically.  If it is, they don't talk about it too much.  They're talking about trying to destroy heteronormative culture, the patriarchal culture.  uh black men are not really mentioned much at all.  okay they talk about black trans men or women trans people.  so if you are a gay black male then they're with you.  if you are a transgender male that has become something else or you now identify as male they're for you.  but if you are a guy like me and like the overwhelming majority of black men just straight then they have nothing for you.  The only time when you really matter to Black Lives Matter is when you get shot and killed by a police officer or a white person or a person that's seen as a vigilante, okay?  Black Lives Matter started according to their own website after Trayvon Martin.  Now, who killed Trayvon Martin?  Was it a cop?  No.  Was it a white person?  No.  It was an Hispanic person that is close enough to white that they see as a vigilante.  So if it's not about black on black violence, but it is about Hispanic on black violence, then what are we talking about?  Also, it was not police like Don Lemon said.  So the whole thing about it being about police brutality is not even true.  Also on Black Lives Matter website, and again, a link to that in the box, they said they're talking about getting certain anti-black politicians out of office and maybe even putting some pro-black politicians in office.  So it's a political movement at this particular point, they said right there on the website.  One of the founders of Black Lives Matter went on TV recently and said that they are trained Marxists and their biggest goal, or at least one of their goals, is to get Donald Trump out of office.  Now, what does Marxism and Donald Trump got to do with Black Lives Mattering?  I'm trying to figure that out.  And I'm trying to figure out how Marxism and Donald Trump relate to police brutality.  I'm not really sure how this whole thing works.  All right.  And I think this whole police brutality and police reform is just kind of a red herring.  It's kind of a smoke screen.  It was the same thing back in 2016.  I tweeted on this day, which is July 7th, 2020.  This day back in 2016, I tweeted the exact same thing I'm saying right now because Black Lives Matter was really popular.  And then what was the reaction from some on the right and mostly all the left?  Oh, we need police reform.  We got to get the police reformed all because of what Black Lives Matter were doing.  They are here.  rioting, looting, shooting, carrying on, causing death, destruction and mayhem, the same as what they were doing back then.  And then our reaction or some of our reaction was, oh, police reform, police reform for what?  Why was police reform necessary back in 2016, but not during 2017, 2018, 2019?  But now all of a sudden in 2020, We need it again.  So, I mean, what was going on in between the 2016 election and now?  Nothing, really.  The only difference between then and now was that it's another election, another big national election with the president up for grabs.  That's pretty much what's going on.  I believe, based upon what I observe and what's on Black Lives Matter's own website, that BLM is more of a political movement.  Shout out to Lord Jamar of the rap group Brand Newbian.  He did an interview with Vlad TV back in 2016.  I think it might have been November.  I'll insert that in the box below as well.  He was talking about how Black Lives Matter is not even really for black people.  And this guy I would look at as more of a liberal or at best a centrist, not a conservative at all.  And he was saying that this is a thing that's set up by George Soros and other people to be a pretend movement.  All right.  You got black.  folks want to start their own little movements, own little things.  And then they get allured into Black Lives Matter.  This is all communism, by the way.  Shout out to Jason Whitlock for that piece of information over on Outkick on Fox News Radio.  He was saying how under communism in Cuba to give you empty slogans.  without actual change or improvements, okay?  Black Lives Matter, hands up, don't shoot.  No justice, no peace, no racist police.  They give you all these slogans and songs, things make you kind of get wrapped up in it.  Those on the left, it's easier for them to get wrapped up in it because they've been trained since they've been a child in their households and also through K-12 education that this is the way to go.  Being liberal is good.  Being liberal is great.  All this and that.  And then some even on the right, some conservatives kind of get wrapped up in it because they don't want to be seen as racist.  They want to, you know, support black lives.  So they get wrapped up in it.  This is all just a game for a political end.  My whole point is that this movement is not for us.  Like I said, something that's been bought, paid for and presented to the black community as racist.  a thing we can be a part of.  And a lot of us, unfortunately, are falling for a hook, line, and sinker.  But to get back to Don Lemon right quick, he was saying a lot of things that simply were not true.  And shout out to Terry Crews for holding his own because a lot of guys, they don't want to come out and say anything.  I get a lot of DMs from high-name people, and they say that what you're saying is right, but I can't say anything.  So Terry Crews is very brave to come out and say what he's saying.  Don Lemon was right about one thing.  When you come out and say things like Terry Crews is saying about Black Lives Matter, it's going to cause a big outrage and controversy.  But anyway, talking about Don Lemon right quick, you're talking about crime being about proximity, how like 85% of whites do this, 95% of whites.  Look, listen.  The issue was with the amount of crime in the black community, that the level of it.  It's not about the percentage of who commits what on who.  It's not even about that.  You could say 95% of blacks kill blacks, 85% of whites kill whites, and it's similar.  Therefore, it's not really a problem.  They'll point to the small difference in... the, you know, black on black versus white on white within, but then we'll look at the total numbers, which is what really matters.  I've said it once.  I've said it twice.  I've said it a thousand times, but I got to say it again.  I guess you've not heard it before.  Black folks are about 13% of the population, but represent 52% of all murderers and 48% of all murder victims in the United States, not just, you know, among blacks.  I'm talking about everybody, okay?  If you take away black on black murder the murder rate in the U.S.  drops by at least half, maybe even more than half.  That's the reality of the situation that we're dealing with, and it shouldn't be that way since we're only 13% of the population.  How does 13% of the population account for over half of the murderers, those that kill people, and 48%, almost half of all the murder victims?  It's because we kill each other at a very high rate.  OK, Terry Crews brought it up.  You're talking about Chicago, Atlanta, New York, all over the United States.  You get really high murder rates.  OK, if black lives matter, I could talk about, you know, transsexuals, homosexuals.  women in general, vigilantes, police, white people as being threats to the black community, then why not black on black crime?  Is it because most of the crime is black men killing other black men and that's not really a problem?  Like I said, the lives of black men only really matter to Black Lives Matter when they're taken by a vigilante, whatever it is, a non-black person or a police officer.  That's really it.  If it's about vigilantes and it's not a color thing, then let's talk about Chaz Chopp, where the so-called security in Chaz killed a 16-year-old black boy and or a 19-year-old young black man, Horace Lorendo Anderson Jr.  Let's talk about that.  Let's talk about the so-called protesters in Atlanta that killed the eight-year-old girl, Sequoia Turner, by shooting into her car.  Not one person accidentally, but two people intentionally shot into the car because they were in the wrong part of town.  They couldn't turn around quick enough.  Let's talk about that.  Let's not play these games, not like... that is not really a problem.  If we can attack that problem, the black on black violence, then we will not have an issue at all to even be discussing.  You know, it wouldn't be to talk about police reform or stuff like that.  If we can eliminate all the crime we got in the community and tighten that up, We'd be fixed.  There will be no need to try and touch external things to fix us.  Let's have us fix us and keep moving from there.  So shout out to Terry Crews for holding his own.  Don Lemon, a shield, of course, for CNN, which is the worst, the absolute worst news network in the entire world.  I'm going to say it right here.  I'm going to keep saying it until they change.  They are the absolute worst.  I do not like them at all.  I hate CNN.  OK.  But aside from my personal feelings about them, you see what they did live on air.  But I think I'll leave that right there for now.  And what say you?  Do you think that I'm right about what I'm saying about the Donovan versus Terry Crews situation?  If that's your viewpoint, let me know why in the comments below.  Or am I wrong?  If that's your viewpoint, let me know why in the comments below.  I think that I'm right on point.  I mean, if the organization is named Black Lives Matter, then black lives should matter.  Let me try and talk about, oh, well, you know, if it's a thing about cancer, then you can't talk about heart disease, all this that.  No, it's about black lives.  So if my black life matters, then it should matter regardless of weight, not just upon basic little things that they want to say.  Some things are more important to black lives matter than others.  That's really the bottom line here.  But whatever your thoughts are, please let me know in the comments below.  And that's all I got to say for this video.
