            "text": "Recently, Mel Magazine covered some of the Honey Badger Brigade.  By that, I mean they published a highly propagandized hit piece by Isabel Kahn.  In her article, she interspersed some details about Karen, Allison, and Anna Cherry, with the standard feminist accusations against Paul Elam, John Hembling, Warren Farrell, and the movement at large, a few lies about the manosphere from other writers' hit pieces, and a handful of feminist political talking points.  Oh, and she mentioned my name once.  Later in the article, there's a link to the HBR talk opener on the topic of benevolent sexism, but she appears to be crediting that to Anna Cherry, despite linking to one of Anna's great videos even further down the page, where you can clearly hear she has a much sexier accent than my chattering Midwestern blather.  But hey, at least I got a mention in a video.  She called Brian Martinez, whose last name she chose to omit for whatever reason, a token guy.  And she didn't even mention anything about his actual work with the group, despite the fact that he's the brigade's producer who runs most of the streaming content made by the group, and who played a huge role in making the 2019 International Conference on Men's Issues happen.  She also didn't at all mention Mike Stevenson, Mike J., Prim Reaper, or Lauren B., who have all been involved in our streams.  HBR Talk with Hannah Wallen.  So, what did the illustrious Mel Writer not leave out of her article?  If you answered valid citations, you'd be wrong.  While she did link a few of her claims to actual online posts by her targets so that the reader could go and judge her distorted takes for themselves, most were just copypasta, lifted, as I said, from other writers' hit pieces, some of which she exposed by linking to her sources.  Her most egregious claims only linked to one of the dumbest hit pieces ever written about the movement.  A GQ article by Dartmouth College professor Jeff Charlotte, who lied his way into the 2014 International Conference on Men's Issues, then lied about its hosts and attendees repeatedly in a piece he used to market himself, for a time, as an expert on us.  So, right out of the chute, you can tell Ms.  Kahn really did her research.  As I went through her article, it struck me that there is really nothing original about what she wrote, even if she did try to cover for that with some pretty flamboyant attempts at creative prose.  All she'd done was sandwich a lot of previously existing slander between attempts at adding her own original examples, all arranged to paint us with the same brush that other feminists have used before she picked it up.  They can't seem to wrap their minds around the idea that people can think for themselves, completely independently of feminist ideology, without malice and without being coerced.  They cannot imagine anything we say or do without filtering it through their male oppressor, female victim lens.  Last week we looked at some of the false equivalences feminists respond with when we criticize feminist lobby law, but when they're not doing that, their narratives are even worse.  According to our critics, we're all just a bunch of angry men raging against women's progress.  You know, basement-dwelling neckbeards with no jobs and no dating prospects who all want to roll back women's rights for some unspecified reason.  When stereotyping us like that doesn't work, they fall back on other threat narratives, tossing labels like misogynist, rape apologist, and wife-beater.  You know, those wife-beating, basement-dwelling, forever-alone incels are the worst, man.  Feel free to roll your eyes now.  It might keep your head from exploding.  In response to arguments against the movement's male demonizing rhetoric, we're told we just don't understand feminism, and pointed to the dictionary definition of the term.  It's not feminists who are pushing those narratives, we're told.  And if we're attributing the words and work of feminist academics, feminist pundits, and feminist politicians to feminist ideology, that really means we just don't understand feminism.  As the Mel article shows, feminists don't understand us, and they don't want to.  They have a particular flavor of hatred for the women of the men's movement.  Gender traitors, they call us.  Handmaidens.  Pick-mes.  You get the drift.  The message?  You cannot care about men without betraying the interests of women.  It's like slut-shaming, only without any allegations of promiscuity.  They're mad that we get along with men.  They're mad that we aren't indifferent to men.  They think that there must be mercenary reasons for a woman to have any compassion or consideration for men because, according to feminists, men don't care about women at all.  Or as Mel put it in their article about us, What have they experienced in life to end up cavorting with men who, to varying degrees, deny their humanity?  Excuse me a moment.  I think I got a bit of malignant melodrama stuck in my throat.  Of course they didn't consider the more important question.  Who are they to decide for us what we think of the men with whom we choose to associate?  What evidence do they have that our humanity is being denied?  Like every hit piece before it, the article presents nothing to back that claim but the writer's own opinions.  It's about time HBR Talks set aside a few episodes to respond, not just to Mel, but to the general attitude and overall set of claims feminists make about anti-feminists and men's rights advocates.  For the next couple of episodes, we're going to do exactly that, beginning with one of the dumbest.  Some feminist outlets are trying to use our movement as a tool to normalize sexual exploitation of young people.  GQ magazine was the first outlet to try this.  Writer Jeff Charlotte gained a press pass to ICMI 2014 by lying to the hosts about his interest in the men's rights movement.  Charlotte, a creative writing professor at Dartmouth College, had pretended to interview several of us at the conference.  He also brought a pedophile with him, and tried to impose him on some of the folks from the Honey Badger Brigade during a lunchtime interview, apparently hoping to create some dirt to publish.  When he didn't get the dirt he wanted from that incident or his interviews, he basically just scrapped the experience and wrote his own narrative about us instead, accompanied by heavily edited photos designed to look as creepy as possible and a heavy effort at associating us with his pedophile friend.  Dean Esme pointed out in a 2015 article for A Voice for Men, exactly how predatory that was.  dean wrote.  charlotte was seen traveling around with and escorting a man whom no one at the conference knew who later turned out to be a pedophile.  he was having meals with a child molester giving him rides and worst of all springing him on people attending the conference and asking them to support child molesters.  Now, I can only think of two plausible reasons.  Jeff Charlotte would be walking around with a child molester in tow at the ICMI.  Either Jeff supports pedophiles, or he was using one to abuse and mock child abuse and rape survivors.  Ponder the irony.  The most charitable interpretation of Jeff Charlotte's actions at the International Conference on Men's Issues in 2014 is that he supports child molesters.  There is, of course, no hard evidence that Jeff Charlotte himself is a pedophile or an enabler.  If we take the route of Occam's razor, he's merely a yellow hack, representing GQ magazine by carting a pedophile around a population of men who have been sexually abused so he could create a vile narrative for a hit piece on the victims.  Dean's right, of course, that there's not solid evidence that Charlotte's a pedo, but in his article, the guy did respond to quoted discussion of male victims of sexual assault with, I think I read that story in a penthouse forum when I was 13.  Dean went on to recall how Charlotte had mocked a female rape survivor for not pitting female versus male survivors in a kind of victim Olympics, right in front of a crowd of her peers.  How sympathetic of the illustrious professor.  In his hit piece on us, Charlotte used his pedophile as his first example of a men's rights activist, as if the guy had been there organically instead of as Charlotte's guest.  What are we supposed to conclude from that?  Dean called him a deviant and a predator for his dishonest behavior toward the conference and the movement.  Frankly, I think he's right.  What Charlotte did was quite predatory, exploiting the situation to create a narrative he could use to make other news outlets interested for a time in interviewing him as an expert on the movement.  Ms.  Khan of Mel Magazine relied on that completely unsourced GQ diatribe to support her claim that the movement's members have pondered lowering the age of consent to 12.  If we had, don't you think she would have been able to find corroborating evidence left by some men's rights activists somewhere online?  If that was a men's rights position, there should have been at least one article on a mainstream men's rights website like A Voice for Men.  Given that she talked about the site, one would think she could have easily learned whether any such thing had been advocated.  Instead, she cited an article that contained no evidence to back its salacious allegations against the movement and had been refuted on A Voice for Men, a fact she'd have known if she'd actually done her research.  Apparently, the truth didn't suit the purposes of Mel Magazine writer Isabel Kahn any more than it did those of GQ writer and Dartmouth College professor Jeff Charlotte.  They couldn't admit to being the only folks advocating for acceptance of pedophilia in a men's rights discussion, so they tried to put it on us.  Charlotte tried to use the Men's Issues Conference to legitimize pedophilia advocacy by portraying it as a men's rights position.  Now, Ms.  Khan of Mel Magazine is trying to do the same thing by citing his article as a legitimate source for calling it one.  Remember what I said last week about one of the secrets to maintaining a clean room?  This is someone else's rubbish.  We are not required to abandon advocacy for the rights of survivors of childhood sexual assault in favor of the ideas of Professor Petto or the writers at Mel Magazine.  If they want to stick their necks out to advocate for predatory exploitation of kids, they're the ones who are responsible for that.  They have no right to impose it on us, and we're not going to take it.  Join HBR Talk as we discuss feminist writers' attempts to impose pedophilia acceptance on the men's rights movement against our will.  Because that's not predatory of them at all, is it?
