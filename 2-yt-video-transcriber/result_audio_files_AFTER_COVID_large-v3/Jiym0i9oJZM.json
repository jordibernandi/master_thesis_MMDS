How's it going, folks?  Thank you.  The water buffalo.  Just for my protection, Staff Sergeant, I just came to ask Benavides if you guys are from Fort McLennan.  I know you guys just had a Best Soldier competition.  Okay, is that nearby?  You can probably Google it if you want.  Yeah, I could, I could.  I was just curious.  I'm waiting for my wife to get some chicken out of here so we can continue on, eat it at the park.  I was in the Marine Corps.  I love this stuff.  But I don't like that.  You got a discipline problem in your ranks.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're dismissed.  No, but you have been dismissed.  You're not following orders.  And it's on record.  There's an objective documentation of it right here.  Right, I figured.  Thank you, brother.  I appreciate you being professional.  You know what I do, aside from my profession, is I look for civil rights violations.  You picked the wrong person to ask for ID.  You don't do that in this country.  We're not Germany.  You understand?  I don't know.  I don't know what you mean.  Well, in 1930s Germany, you had to cough up your papers like you were trying to do.  Okay.  Yeah, we fought against them.  We won.  And we don't do that here.  Right.  You got it?  I still don't know who you are.  You don't need to.  You know who I am?  I'm a concerned citizen.  Yes.  Yeah.  Who you swore to defend and protect.  Oh, yeah.  You know, I get it.  A lot of people have an understandable apprehension.  But I don't even have the camera out, man.  I was just asking.  I'm going in circles because I'm waiting for my wife to get the chicken.  That's it.  You want to see some ID.  like you're a cop, like you have reasonable, articulable suspicion of a crime having been committed?  That's what is required to ID somebody.  You have to think that I'm a criminal.  So you asking me for ID is insinuating that I'm a criminal, questioning my integrity.  I understand.  Good.  Yeah, but Benavides has a chip on his shoulder, a little Napoleonic complex.  It's either Staff Sergeant or Sergeant First Class Benavides.  And he's with the engineers.  It's a First Amendment activity.  Tell them it's the First Amendment.  That's what we're doing here.  Freedom of the press.  You can look it up.  Rights crispy.  Like, know your rights.  Crispy, spelled correctly.  You're going to see yourself look dumb on the internet.  Hey, bro.  Take care, bro.  We're looking for civil rights violations.  Don't commit any like that guy.  Hey, Stepson, did you call the cops?  Oh, okay.  I just don't want them chasing me around town.  I'll wait for them if you did.  If not, let them know I'll be at the park.  Hey, how's it going?  Fantastic.  How are you?  Were you the one over there by the military truck?  I was.  And your name and badge number, please? ",
