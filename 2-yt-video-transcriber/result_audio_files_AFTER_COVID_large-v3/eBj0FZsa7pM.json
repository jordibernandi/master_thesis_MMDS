He was actually filming an episode of Undercover Boss.  Surprise, your boss is here.  A citizen.  I'll put it back in there.  I'll get it to you.  Oh, okay.  Has anybody turned the body camera off?  No.  So he was probably running.  No, that's what I'm saying.  The only thing I did was touch the top to turn it off.  I mean, to take it off of.  All right, I'm going to run his gun.  I think it was one of those things that he did, Adam.  To be honest with you.  Oh, he's completely spooked about that body camera.  He keeps on bringing it up.  He keeps on asking, did anybody turn it off?  Oh, it must have been on.  Somebody doesn't sound too confident that they did everything by the book.  I'm not sure what book you're reading, but I'm pretty sure the book doesn't have a page in which if a citizen is not wearing a mask, which is a city ordinance, you have the right to pull your taser on them.  When... The real penalty is a verbal warning.  There's still another 11 minutes left in that video, so go on over to Brett McCain's channel and subscribe.  It has a twist in the ending.  But this video right here is from Disorderly Product News presents the Caparazzi and its Santa Fe, New Mexico police officers handing out $50 tickets for people outside who are not wearing masks.  I repeat, outside, not wearing masks.  They give them $50 tickets, and the warning is they're going to go up to $100.  And there's a Karen right there on the left, and she comes running up to the officers.  She can't wait to tell on people not wearing their masks out in public.  And she gets so bummed out when the officer says, oh, well, they're eating.  They don't have to wear their mask.  So go on over to Brett McCain's channel.  Make sure you hit the subscribe button and make sure you tell him Disorderly Product News sent you.  Anyways, I want to wish you guys a very happy and healthy weekend.
