Sanctified?  Allowed?  What do you say?  So, Mormon families, typically, from what I've observed from, you know, ex-Mormon friends and family and, you know, just being Mormon and knowing a lot of Mormon people, is that most Mormon families are really bad at resolving issues and they repress all of their emotions.

Like, outside of certain values, like, you know, be kind to each other and, you know, those basic values that we all want in our families.  I just feel like families should be a space where everyone can, like, return to, to feel this sense of unconditional belonging, but can go out into the world from.  Like, they should provide that safe space of, like, you belong, you, you know, we've got you, and it's like a home base, to then go out into the world and do your own thing, and be your own person.  You only have to look at ex-Mormons and how hard they struggle to... continue having good relationships with their families to know that like I feel like Mormon family relationships are not built on a firm foundation like they're built on a weak foundation because the minute someone's beliefs change suddenly the whole relationship falls to shit.  so how you know How firm a foundation can that be?

And I think that is ultimately what helps people change the most, is when you don't need them to, when your love just allows for them to be as they are.  And in no place should it be like that as much as the family.  So it's not really about acceptance or unconditional love, it's about conformity, obedience.

Like, me and my mum don't agree on anything, but it doesn't really matter that much, because you just kind of have that shared love and the things that you do connect on.  But like, yeah, Mormons have identical views to their family members, so sure, in that sense, they're very united, but they're not strong, because again, if you remove those beliefs, it's over.  People leave the church and then their own mothers won't talk to them anymore.  A family where your ability to feel loved by them can be so easily removed just feels so unhealthy.  Totally.
