If it helps one person, that's great.  If you feel like if you help one person, you've done your job.  You guys read the title?  Let's go ahead and get into it.  the subject is this is going to be the craziest story you will ever hear.  really all right he titles it the story disclaimer.  i apologize if there are typos.  there's so much and i just voiced it so it's typed out that way.  let me know if you have any questions.  Still going through it, and I would love some life advice.  I'm 24 and separated.  To this day, I don't know if I can, will, ever be with another woman, but if I do, I hope it's not one like her.  He starts off with, I don't really even know how to start this, but this is how my marriage has failed and why I know I need to get a divorce.  To get this out of the way first, I am a 24 year old guy who was very naive.  Not only was I naive, but I was a little bit insecure going into the whole thing because of the fact that no woman has ever found me attractive.  And this was not only my first relationship, but my first anything with anyone.  So I did not necessarily know what to expect.  And when most guys would usually cut out of the relationship, I didn't know when that stopping point was.  So I allowed things to go on when they shouldn't have.  Me and wifey met back in 2017.  She came to one of my house parties back when I had all the energy in the world.  We were chilling and I got her number that night as friends and I was not expecting anything more.  Between that November going into February, we had become best friends and eventually she admitted that she had grown to have feelings for me and from there we started dating.  About three months into us dating, we both knew what we wanted.  But even more, we started pushing towards getting engaged.  I'm not sure when it happened, but at some point, somehow, we all started looking at venues for our wedding.  I should have taken this as a sign that things are moving way too fast.  I should have cut out, but I never did.  That July, I just went with things, got a nice ring, and proposed.  We were already best friends, so it was hard to fight those feelings that I had.  Shortly after that, she became more bossy, and I didn't know how to deal with it.  So I'd just agree with everything, you know, just like a simp would.  My homeboys out of nowhere started telling me that they didn't know about this girl anymore, that they had heard some things, but of course, I didn't want to hear it, because I was already engaged to her, and I loved her.  We are now in December 2018.  I had just moved out of my parents' home to be more independent since the wedding was going to be in April.  She lived an hour away, so it would be easier to see her every day.  Of course, me and her had to talk and she said that she had slept with maybe one or two guys and I kept it as that.  You believe the one or two?  But what I didn't know is that she had lied to me about this.  If Hope was a person, it would be her.  One night, I'm on Twitter, and I get a DM from an anonymous account with one single link.  I open the link, and all I see, right front and center, I open the link, and all I see, right front and center, is my girl sucking D in the back of a car.  It had posted around the time that we started dating.  I knew my girl was a freak, but this hurt me directly in my soul.  I went crazy.  She had told me that she didn't know when and or she didn't even know who it was and claimed that she had to have been on drugs at the time and couldn't remember much of that time in her life.  And then she said she thinks it's RP and we need to catch the guy.  Of course we talked and sex was so good.  Being she was and still is the only one I had been with, I quickly felt I had to let it go because it was before us and I made efforts to delete it.  As I dug down the rabbit hole, I began to see more, but knew I couldn't and wasn't ready to look at that, so I left it alone and continued our relationship.  I had lost so much respect for her, but I still loved her, and in the end, we ended up still getting married.  After we had gotten married, the RP was still bothering me.  And I knew I had to get rid of it.  So I went down the rabbit hole again and began to realize that the profile that had had it all on there was clearly ran by her.  The account that sent me that link likely was from somebody else.  I got insecure and went through her phone just to find out that she knew exactly when that video happened and who it was with.  Her and her ex were texting back and forth about it, which hurt me even more and made me lose so much trust in her because I knew she was lying and she was willing to lie to me to my face.  There were for sure hundreds of photos and videos on her Tumblr history, a website that was all her and different guys, all which anyone can find through a simple Google search.  But even with that, our marriage starting out was so great.  She would cook every night.  We were having the most fun either one of us have ever had in our lives.  Until she suddenly and drastically got depressed.  I tried to do whatever I could to make her happy.  But when it's something medical, there's not much you can do.  This was all beginning to pile up.  The house began falling apart and I would get angrier and angrier because she would be at home all day because she was a stay-at-home wife.  I began to expect a lot out of her, but she took it as me being abusive or mean.  So I got a text one day that said that I am no longer her husband and she needed some space, which led to her beginning to hang out more and more with her new friends that I had never met in my life.  nor was she going to have them over.  i was never going to meet them.  according to her.  i tried to be supportive because before this i had accused her of cheating due to the obvious insecurities i had built up because of that big old lie.  one day i came upstairs and heard her on the phone with her new friends talking about how she was hanging out with this guy and how he makes her feel and a number of other things.  After she had gotten off the phone I was asking her for clarity on what I had heard which made it worse because she called me insecure and told me essentially that I was tripping and I didn't hear what I thought I heard.  There goes gaslighting guys.  Shortly after this she began taking long drives because I have been working from home lately.  One night she had not come home until around 2 o'clock in the morning, stating that her and her friends were having too much fun and she had been smoking marijuana, which I knew she did, and she had gotten too high and couldn't make it home.  I let it go.  Aww.  Although I shouldn't have because I had caught her in another lie a week or two before.  When I called one of her older friends, I knew and the friend said she hadn't been over there in forever.  Shortly after this, I would leave in the morning and not see her until the next day.  If not when I'm going to bed, she stopped coming home and I knew something was up, but I didn't know what to do.  since it had already been put on me that I'm being overly insecure and not giving her her space.  We get to May 2020.  I'll come home from work and yet again she was not home earlier in the day.  She sent me a picture of her and her friends.  I noticed that her wedding ring was not on though.  She claimed that she was getting her hair done and in that picture she had a specific pair of shoes on but yet when I come home the shoes are in her closet as if she had taken that picture much earlier.  Oh, she gotcha.  I go for a walk and I try to clear my head, but soon go back inside.  I'm in IT.  I got on my computer that she also used.  I ran a script that would log me into her computer account and I got into her email.  Nothing out of the usual there.  But then I remembered all of her photos.  she backs up through Google Photos.  So I go to that website and see all that I was expecting to see.  Screenshot between her and this guy claiming that she needed abortion money since they had effed without a condom.  She was telling me that she might be pregnant around the time.  she was texting him back and forth as well.  Not only did I find screenshots of text messages, but I found screenshots of a Tinder account she had made as well as a fake Instagram that I did not know about.  i was in shock in pure disbelief.  i'll spare you some of the dramatics on my end but after our conversation she tells me that those accounts are run by her new friend to try and finesse them out of their money because it's a hot girl summer for them and that there was a party And she had gotten too high.  And next thing she knew, she was on her back and that she had been taken advantage of.  I burst out in tears, losing my mind.  I tell her we need to report this man.  But she says that not only does she not want it to be in the police database, but her friend was also taken advantage of as well.  And that her friend's boyfriend ended up killing that man, which sounds totally unbelievable and extremely crazy.  I agree.  that sounds insane but when i'm already heartbroken irate and confused i was believing everything she had said.  oh my gosh dude i mean listen that story does sound crazy.  first of all i don't listen.  here's the thing i don't think they were taking advantage of.  they might have been doing some things on the side and the boyfriend called them boom that could have actually happened Or she could have made the whole thing up.  Either way, I agree with you.  It's crazy.  And it's crazy that you believed her.  But let's keep going.  She tells me that she would do anything to make our relationship better.  She will stay home every night, cook, even meet me at work to have sex in the car whenever I need it.  She would do anything to keep our marriage.  And of course, we just try to jump back into things.  But as I began to question things over that month that followed, she became less and less willing to answer even stating that I did not deserve the answers after asking so many times about it.  In my opinion, it was because her story was beginning to fall apart.  Absolutely.  Every time she would tell me, they would either be a new detail or detail change.  About a month ago, she tells me that she believed that it could be that she was never taken advantage of.  That all the girls are making this story up and nothing ever happened.  And we can try and go back to what we were before.  An experience like that mentally matured you.  I looked at her with the most disgusting look that I have ever given her in her life.  I could not believe what she was trying to do right now.  Act as if nothing had ever happened and all the pain and suffering that she had just put our relationship through wasn't a thing.  A week after that, knowing what I knew and due to the huge lie and lies she has been telling me before, I knew that I couldn't do it anymore.  Look, man, I'm a Christian, so I believe the only reason for divorce is if someone cheats.  I cut my losses, and I announced to her that we are separating.  Since then, I have had the most stress-free life since 2017.  I cannot believe all the crap I was willing to put up with and all that she had done.  I did not believe in the red pill, I'm gonna be honest.  But what I do know is that women will try anything to get over on you.  It's about knowing what you are worth.  Wow.  Wow, man.  So you ended with you do not believe in the red pill.  Surprising.  After what you've been through.  And you even after that, you said you understand female nature or let me let me not misquote you.  But what I do know is that women will try anything to get over on you.  Female nature.  You understand that, but you don't believe in the red pill.  I don't know if you're just not as familiar with it or you haven't heard enough information or things, but I did find that interesting.  I'm not going to come down on you because you don't.  Like, oh, you don't belong here.  You don't belong here.  No, I don't care what you are, what label you ride behind or anything.  But your experience is your experience.  I hope you learned from it.  You got out of that situation.  You're separated.  And I think in the beginning you said you guys are working towards a divorce and you know you need to divorce and you need some advice.  Yeah, you need to divorce her.  You should have divorced her a long time ago.  Actually, let's take it back to the beginning.  When you got that DM of her slobbing somebody's knob in a car, that's no marriage.  Let's hold, let's stop on the marriage for a minute.  Let's get some things figured out.  You know, um, But you said you were new.  This was your first anything, first everything.  I get it.  But like, you can't let that blind you.  So anybody else listening to this who have, you know, they're in a first time situation and they're hearing this and they're like, man, I guess my situation is kind of similar.  I'm seeing red flags, but I know I'm choosing to ignore them.  Don't ignore them because you'll end up like this.  Dude, she's smashing whoever, no condom, getting skeeted in.  Coming back home and smashing you.  She's putting you at risk.  Is it worth it?  No, it's not worth it.  So when you see red flags, you need to jump on them.  Throughout the story, I'm like, man, why is he ignoring this?  Why is he ignoring that?  You found the Tumblr.  She had tons of videos.  You knew for a fact.  she knew who she was sleeping with.  She was talking to her ex about it.  I don't know.  Was she an online porn star?  Was she one of those amateur porn stars?  Was she an escort?  What was she doing?  No matter what she was doing, you didn't need to be married to her.  It didn't make any sense.  That was, I don't know why you married her.  All the signs were there.  Your friends tried to warn you.  You ignored them.  She warned you with the red flags.  You ignored them.  But now you're here.  You're separated.  I really hope you go through with the divorce.  Do not go back to her, please.  And do me a favor.  Just try to listen more to red pill content.  Just take a listen.  And I don't know if you have and you're just like, I don't know if it's because you just still believe in relationships and you want to be married.  There are red pill men who are married.  There are red pill men in relationships.  So don't think you can't.  But just make sure you understand a woman's nature.  That's it.  That's all.  So try to give it another listen.  Just YouTube it.  Type in red pill.  Google.  Reddit.  don't don't just denounce it.  i don't know why you didn't explain why.  so i'd like to know why.  if you want to email me back let me know.  like what is it about?  you don't.  what is it about red pill you don't like?  we can do a video on that.  but um guys you heard the story.  let him know.  give him some advice.  what should he do?  i think he should divorce her.  i'm glad he's separated from her.  um what do you think about this story?  Let me know in the comments.  And if you want to send in a story, send it to truestorynation at gmail.com.  Here, I'll put it on the screen.  That's truestorynation at gmail.com.  And I'll catch you guys at the next one. ",
