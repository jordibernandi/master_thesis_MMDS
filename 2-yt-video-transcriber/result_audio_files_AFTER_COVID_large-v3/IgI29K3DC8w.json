            "text": "We don't have to play the zero-sum game that the governor wants us to play.  Rather, we can and should say, in regard to this and anything else, O Lord, it is you who have accomplished all that we have done.  Just a few days ago, Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York made a statement about the progress being made in the coronavirus situation in New York.  And in the course of that, he made a statement of some theological moment, I thought.  He said, look, God didn't do this.  Faith didn't do it.  We did it.  And he emphasized all the steps that people had taken that they had accomplished this great reduction in the number of the sick.  Well, I remember as I was watching it thinking, not only is a remark full of hubris, it's also characterized by a misunderstanding that is all too common even among believers.  What I mean is this.  Underneath that statement is the assumption that God is one competitive cause among others.  So there's all the causality that we can affect within the world.  And then alongside of that, there's the kind of fussy intervening causality of God.  So that God is this being who does certain kind of spectacular supernatural things, and then there's the rest of us who affect the normal things.  Well, the problem with that is, in our great theology, God is not one fussy cause among many.  He's not one of the things that occasionally intervenes so that we can parcel out responsibility.  Oh, God did that, but the rest of us did other things.  That's precisely the wrong way to think about God.  Now, to see the roots of this, go right back to the Bible.  Go especially to 1 and 2 Samuel, the books that detail for us the cycle of stories about King David.  I think you see the principle really clearly there.  So think of all the stories about David, from David and Goliath to the struggle with Saul, David coming to power, David ruling as king, the Bathsheba incident, the rebellion of Absalom, the whole range of stories about David.  What's amazing about 1 and 2 Samuel is that hardly anything clearly supernatural happens in those books.  What you're seeing is a story that could be understood on psychological grounds, on political grounds, on sociological grounds.  All of it sort of makes sense.  And, all the way through, the author is assuming that God is acting too.  So, yeah, I could read it in a purely sort of secular way.  Well, no, I can understand why David did this or that, how David came to power, why David was seducing Bathsheba, and all of that.  I could explain it.  Okay, true.  And God was active and involved in all of it at the same time.  In other words, it's a non-competitive causality.  Not alongside of our causality, but... underneath and through it all.  Here's a line from the prophet Isaiah that if you want a one-line summary of what I'm talking about in the Bible, it's this.  The prophet says, O Lord, it is you who have accomplished all that we have done.  It's a very cool, interesting statement, isn't it?  Because Isaiah is not denying for a second that we've done it.  So all these things that we have done, Read that psychologically, militarily, politically, interpersonally, any way you want.  We've done it.  But, Lord, it's you who've accomplished all that we have done.  It's that paradox that's at the key of our understanding of how God relates to the world.  Now, let me go from Isaiah to St.  Thomas Aquinas, the greatest of our theologians, as he articulates this relationship.  As I've said many times, people that have followed my work, for Aquinas, God is not the ens summum.  That's Latin for highest being.  So I'm a being, you're a being, there are beings all around me, and then there's God, who's the highest type of being.  Thomas says, no, God is not an instance within the genus being.  So here's this great genus of existing things, and you and I and everything else belong under that heading, and God must be the highest of those beings.  No, Aquinas says, God is not in any genus, even the genus of being.  Hmm.  He's not the ensumum, Thomas says, but rather ipsum esse subsistens.  That means God is the sheer act of to be itself.  We say God is the creator of all things.  Mind you, not one fussy thing among many.  By the way, read every one of the new atheists and you find exactly that problem.  Oh, where is this God?  Where is this Supreme Being?  I don't see Him anywhere.  I don't see any evidence of the Supreme Being.  Well, you're not looking for the right thing.  God is rather that creative ground in and through which all finite things exist and operate.  I think now Catholics will recognize this.  One of the prefaces to the Eucharistic prayer in the Roman Rite is, Lord, in you we live and move and have our being.  Now that's naming what I'm talking about.  In you we live and move and have our being.  Your causality is not competitive and interruptive, but rather it's a kind of cooperative and enabling causality, if that makes sense.  Okay, we've done Bible, we've done Thomas, which is kind of high abstractions.  Can I make it real concrete?  Let's say someone asks you now, how do you make a bicycle?  How do you put a bicycle together?  And you might say, well, yeah, you need tires.  You need some kind of frame.  You need a chain.  You need brake pads.  You need maybe a schematic to guide the building process.  You need your own mind and your skill as a builder.  Okay, yeah, makes sense.  What wouldn't you ever say?  Okay, to make a bike, you need two tires, you need a metal frame, you need God, you need a schematic, you need the skill.  Well, of course not.  You're naming God there as one fussy element or one fussy cause among many.  But watch.  Suppose a pious and smart Catholic has just put together a bike using all the causes I've just mentioned.  He would say, and I'd praise him for it, at the end of the process, he'd say, thank God.  Thank you, Lord.  Well, what's he doing?  He's not saying, oh, I'm glad God showed up as one of those necessary causes among... No, what he was saying was, Lord, you, what he's acknowledging, Lord, you are the ground of all of these causal elements, including my own mind, including my own skill.  Lord, it's you, ultimately, who are responsible for chain and brake pad and metal frame and schematic, etc.  You're the matrix out of which and because of which all these finite causes subsist.  And therefore, even as I acknowledge all these things, yeah, I put this bike together using these things.  Fine.  And thank you, Lord, for guiding me.  Thank you, Lord, for helping me.  That's a perfectly consistent point of view.  Okay.  All of which brings me back now to Governor Cuomo.  Hey, hey, everybody.  It's not God that did this.  Not faith that did this.  We did this.  We brought the numbers down.  Okay, what brought the numbers down in New York?  Great nurses and doctors and first responders and the technology available in our hospitals, the hunkering down of millions of ordinary citizens.  Yeah, yeah, that all produced the flattening of the numbers.  But can't you say, even as you acknowledge all of that, yeah, and thank God, thank God the numbers went down.  Yes, yes, because we're not parceling out, oh, no, no, we took care of all of that.  God had nothing to do with it.  No, no, we did it and God had everything to do with it.  In other words, we don't have to play the zero-sum game that the governor wants us to play.  Rather, we can and should say in regard to this and anything else, O Lord, it is you who have accomplished all that we have done.  They're both true.  Thanks so much for watching.
