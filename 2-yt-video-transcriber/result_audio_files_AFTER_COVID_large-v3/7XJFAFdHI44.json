            "text": "So I just left Walmart and the whole time I'm in there, everybody's mean mugging me and giving me dirty looks just because I'm not a sheep and I refuse to wear a mask.  I got a condition.  I was diagnosed with being selfish.  I can barely breathe as it is.  I'm like a human pug.  The only mask I'm wearing is my CPAP machine.  They want me to wear a mask and trap in all my CO2, which is bad.  I breathe in oxygen and breathe out the CO2 and it gets trapped in the mask.  Next thing you know, I'm breathing in secondhand air and thirdhand air.  fourth hand air.  everybody knows the oxygen can get in but when you breathe out all that co2 just gets trapped in and there's no way on god's flat earth that anything can escape that mask except for the corolla virus which makes the mask pointless in the first place.  And all these doctors out here saying, make sure you wear your masks.  Well, I went to the university of YouTube and I graduated, MAGA yelled loudly.  So they're not the only educated ones out here.  That is if they can make their mind up in the first place, they said, don't wear a mask, then wear a mask.  It's like science is willing to change its viewpoint on things when presented with new information.  Well, I'm not willing to change ever.  And my friend on Facebook said masks are bad and he's a doctor.  He works for Dr.  Scholz.  He works for a store that sells Dr.  Schultz.  What I'm trying to say is all these doctors better stop having my best interest at heart because it's tyranny.  And I'll wear a mask if I want to.  It's my body, my choice, which applies to everybody unless you're a pregnant woman.  You people think us maggots are stupid just because we're dumb.  Well, I'll tell you one thing we're not, and that's sheep.  You can see him leaving Walmart right now.  Look, there's one sheep right there and two sheep and three sheep and four.  God damn. ",
