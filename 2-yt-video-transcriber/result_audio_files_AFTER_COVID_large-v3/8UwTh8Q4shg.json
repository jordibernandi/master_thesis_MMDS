            "text": "If you laugh in the next 10 seconds, you lose.  Go.  Donald John Trump incited the erection.  I love you too, but you're not my type.  I don't care who you are.  If you don't like Trump, if you didn't vote for him, if you're glad he's gone, you can still admit that that is hilarious.  Happy Sunday!  Welcome to another episode of You Laugh, You Lose.  And if you laughed at that opening clip, you already lose and you have to go and answer the poll question on the community tab.  We're settling this once and for all, guys.  Head over there, let me know what you think.  Pineapple on pizza or no?  Simple yes or no.  That's it.  That's all you gotta do.  Make sure you comment below on the thing too so it spreads far and wide.  Apparently people are breaking the YouTube algorithm, so let's do it on this channel too.  Go to the poll.  Go answer the poll, please.  And if you laughed, you have to.  You have no choice.  And as for the rest of this game, if you laugh, you lose again.  If you laugh at anything, it's over.  You lose.  Your punishment is waiting for you at the end.  But first, before we get into today's game, a real quick shout out.  I get emails continually asking me about the flag behind me.  If you want one, head over to Old Glory Rustic Sign.  They have customizable signs.  They're all handmade, handcrafted, laser engraved.  If you want one, type in Z21.  for 10% off and free shipping.  But before you go do that, we have to play the rest of today's game.  So if you laugh at anything in the rest of today's video, you lose.  Go.  Double mask.  Efficiency 75%.  Triple mask.  Efficiency 90%.  Sex triple mask.  Efficiency literally and racism.  This was very real.  By the way, this isn't even funny.  The double mask thing, that's real.  The triple mask thing, I think that's real, too.  I think this was an actual graphic on CNBC.  And Fauci, all the boys, they're saying, wear double mask now.  That's where we're at.  And also, I want to say, I thought a single mask was, like, really high percent.  So what is it?  Double mask is only 75%.  What's a single?  Show us that, too, please.  You told us that worked.  When something doesn't fit in the fridge, so you force it and let it fall on someone else.  The only thing worse than this is... Well, there's two things worse, actually.  The next worst thing is taking the last thing out of the box in the cupboard and leaving the empty box in there.  That's a dick move.  And the worst thing you could possibly do is leave one pizza roll in the bag.  That is the worst thing you can do.  Someone comes along and says, oh, yeah, pizza rolls.  This is going to be delicious.  And then they only have one.  That is a dick move.  I'm talking to you, Deef.  Talking to you.  Beef jerky costs too much.  Look at that.  There's a cause we can all get behind.  Let's start campaigning.  Beef jerky costs too much.  Oh, man.  I wonder what the efficiency rate of this mask is.  Wow.  Wow, wow, wow.  That's a lot of effort, too.  Like, if you don't want to wear a mask and you say, I'm just going to paint one on.  Eh.  And I hope that's painting, not a tattoo.  Y'all be sure to leave those buying signs in your yard so people will know where to siphon gas when it's $8 a gallon.  Take mental note, guys.  Take mental note.  Gas prices are already rising, and it seems like they're going to be rising here for a while.  He don't bite.  He's just trying to smell you.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh man, why are you stepping on the door handle like that?  What you order on Wish is what actually arrives.  Pretty, uh, pretty accurate analogy there.  That's, uh... When she says all my best friends are guys.  Don't do this, by the way.  That's a fire hazard, guys.  Come on.  Oh, what the hell is going on today?  UN, when a genocide is happening in Central Africa.  I sleep.  UN, when oil-rich country has a civil war.  Real shit.  That's true.  Let's head to Syria.  We're heading to Syria soon, I'll guarantee it.  Next three years, we'll be there.  Iran.  Might be back in Iraq, Afghanistan.  Who knows?  Who knows?  But when it happens in Central Africa, when it happens in East Timor, who cares?  Today's work-from-home tip.  Blowing on the wine in the mug will help convince your Zoom meeting that your tea is hot.  There you go, some at-home work tips.  I don't condone this.  If you're going to do it, you can cover it up that way.  He needs to be six feet or taller, with a nice beard, drive a BMW, and have his own house.  Her.  Accurate.  The standards that people have today.  Come on, guys.  Self-reflect a little bit here.  Tell me more about how funny the 7,231st Bernie meme is.  It's exactly what I was saying.  Like, 10 memes into it.  It was funny at first.  Like I said, I saw Jake Tapper just kill it.  All the CNN anchors, they just thought it was great.  Hey, look it, I'm just one of the plebs.  I'm sharing memes of Bernie.  You killed it.  You killed it faster than the Tiger King memes, and that is tough to do.  That was funny for about 48 hours.  This was funny for about 12.  Narrow grip, no arched back, and benching 485 pounds raw.  Mrs.  Frizzle is on the juice.  She is definitely on the juice, dude.  That is... Yeah.  That's what they're teaching kids.  That's what they were teaching us.  Unreal.  Destroy all the evidence.  I have to give him props for that.  When Gen Zers say AOC is smart, when you realize they're the next generation of voters and politicians.  Yes.  This is alarming.  Black Lives Matter.  I'm starting to get a feeling that the Democratic Party used this.  Been saying this the whole time.  I do have to say that this is not a real tweet.  I saw this everywhere.  It's not a real tweet.  Just disclaimer.  But it could be a real tweet because the Democratic Party did use them.  We've known this.  From Insider, a controversial vegan TikToker roasted Gordon Ramsay for eating meats.  And he responded by shoving a hamburger in his mouth.  That's how you do it, everyone.  That's how you respond to trolls.  And I also want to say, I saw someone commenting, saying that I said I hate vegetarians and vegans.  I don't hate anyone.  I don't hate vegetarians and vegans.  But if you're going to tell me that I can't eat a cheeseburger... I'm going to shove it down your throat by eating a cheeseburger just like Gordon Ramsay here.  All right?  Don't tell me what to do.  I won't tell you what to do.  Eat your veggies.  I'll eat the hamburgers.  All right?  Found a free vaccine on the ground.  Today is my lucky day.  If only we were all this lucky, you know, just finding vaccines on the ground.  Good on you.  Good luck to you.  Oh, no, no, no, no.  Right in it!  Oh!  I don't know what's worse, that or the parent that videotaped this and posted it online.  Oh, this poor kid.  That is, that's a fart in the face, literally.  Hi, my name is Megan.  I'm here for the girls track meet.  Hey, Megan.  Good luck to you.  Good luck to you, Megan.  Guys, this is Biden's America now.  This is a direct order.  All right?  Megan is allowed to compete.  Stop it, you bigot.  Man spends lockdown living as a massive rabbit.  Again, um... I'm not sure if I'm more concerned about this guy living as a massive rabbit for lockdown or if I'm more concerned about this being an article and this guy getting a platform and me putting this on here.  What's wrong with me?  Executive orders in the first three days.  Wow, look at that.  What a tyrannical... dictator Trump is.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  The guy's a fascist.  He's a fascist right wing Nazi.  I just can't believe it.  You know, and thankfully he's gone.  because look at this.  Look at what he did.  Look at what he did compared to everyone else.  What a fascist.  Good evening.  It's six o'clock and here's what we want you to think.  Turn it off.  Turn off the garbage.  Garbage on TV.  Proof that Earth is not flat.  Eh?  Touche, flat earthers.  Explain this one.  Explain it, please.  Down in the comments.  Let me know.  White House hires new maid.  I absolutely love that photo.  That is great.  When Joe Biden finds out the Middle East still exists.  So anyway, I started blasting.  Again, I'm telling you, it's going to happen.  It's going to happen.  We're going to Syria, Iran, somewhere.  We're going there somewhere.  Stock market, Reddit.  Look at me.  I'm the captain now.  Ah, yes.  If you missed the drama this week, it was pretty epic.  Pretty epic.  Wall Street, they weren't happy.  Janet Yellen, Biden's... appointee janet yellen went to their defense.  it was pretty disgusting actually and this proof the swamp is alive and well the free market does not exist.  my job has been furloughed since lockdowns began in march of 2020. but don't worry democrats are impeaching a president who isn't president anymore.  that's because these politicians they don't actually care about you they don't.  they don't care about any of us.  they don't the media.  when amy barrett says she's catholic why media?  when biden says he's catholic?  ah they wanted to get rid of amy coney barrett bashing her saying she wasn't for women's rights.  but now now they're trying to pander to christians by saying oh yeah biden's catholic yes oh he's such a great uniter.  you guys are so transparent.  you guys are so transparent.  shut up.  We will not unite behind you and Biden.  It will not happen.  I'm sorry.  It's not going to happen.  Is your milkshake really worth it?  Oh, man.  This is how milkshakes are made.  I can't believe it.  I knew it.  I knew it.  You guys side with Peter here when you're the first female vice president, but can't claim it since your party doesn't recognize genders.  Yeah.  Which is it?  Which is it?  Did you break the glass ceiling or does no glass ceiling exist?  Because there are no genders.  Quality.  Which is it?  When you're eight over through three and see the beverage cart.  Hey, that's me.  That's me every single time.  Except, you know, it might be 10 to 12 over through three.  I don't know.  Depends on the day.  If you've ever felt useless, just remember that the NFL has used security guards to watch crowds of cardboard cutouts.  More proof that we are living in clown world right now.  Jennifer Lawrence, if I meet Trump, it'll end with a martini to the face.  She actually said that.  And this is the same person.  Never forget this, guys.  Never forget Hollywood, the hypocrisy, the things that they claim to care about, and what they actually act like.  This looks like a dope concert until you realize it's a cotton harvester.  What the?  That is bizarre.  What is up with these memes lately?  These concert memes?  Eating warhead candies, me like.  That's pretty accurate.  Come on, man!  Japan fails to destroy America.  USSR also fails to destroy America.  America, fine, I'll do it myself.  Our own worst enemy.  It's coming to fruition.  Rogers, where are you taking me, daddy?  Brady, to school, son.  Hell yeah, that's what I'm talking about.  Tom Brady going to the Super Bowl, taking down Aaron Rodgers.  Screw you, Packers.  Screw you.  Governments use fake wasp nests to hide face recognition cams.  Whenever you see a wasp nest, hit it with a stick to destroy the cam.  Ah, just for the fact checkers' sakes, because I know that they fact check the dumbest stuff.  That's a fact check true.  Hit that with a stick.  If you kill someone during a burglary, it's because you value things more than someone else's life.  No, it's because they value my things more than their life.  I've seen this dumb argument from lefties all the time, but that's the real truth.  Don't break into someone else's house for things if you value your life.  They're the ones not valuing their own life.  It's true.  When she starts eating your fries, even though she said she wasn't hungry.  Guys.  Guys.  But yeah, the point of the meme, though, is true.  Every time.  Every time this happens.  Swear.  Fellas, tell me I'm not wrong.  When the baby is less than a month old and parents do a photo shoot session.  This is so true.  Why?  Parents, why are you doing this?  You know, maybe take the photos and keep them to yourself, put them in the album or whatever.  But don't post them everywhere.  The baby looks like a little alien.  It's true.  Every little baby, for the most part, looks like an alien.  Stop it.  My paycheck before taxes.  My paycheck after taxes.  Accurate, accurate.  Lower taxes, everyone.  Lower taxes.  Come on, get on the train.  Tyler, if you laugh, you have to do your punishment.  Everyone, no, I don't think I will.  You're not going to do your punishment, eh?  You got something coming to you.  Them, how many push-ups can you do?  Me, if they're the orange flavor, I know for a fact I can do seven of them in one sitting.  You guys want to give me crap for pineapple pizza, but there are some of you out there that like the orange-flavored push-ups.  That is disgusting.  The only Schwan's Man push-ups worth eating are the chocolate ones.  Everyone knows this.  If you eat those orange ones, something is wrong with you, actually.  Me and the boas after getting banned from big tech on all platforms.  Yeah, it's about where we're gonna be here soon.  So, uh, get the smoke signal.  practice in.  Get out there and practice those smoke signals.  Wife on the phone with husband.  I don't know what to do.  It's so cold and the car doesn't turn on.

Guys, I'm gonna have to fact check this.  This is for Chevys.  I drive a Ford, alright?  I drive a Ford.  That's what happens when you drive a Chevy.  Actually, you know what?  Let's unite here.  Chevy, Ford, this is what happens when you drive a Dodge or a GMC.  We all know this.  We all know this.  Come on, this isn't a Ford.  Get the meme rights.  The last three presidents.  Yeah, yeah, that's a good meme.  Still not presidents.  Hey, silver linings, guys.  Silver linings.  She's still yapping, still being annoying as all hell, but she's still not the president.  So look at that.  Silver linings.  How to piss off the internet with one picture.  Guys, I don't know if we killed the pineapple meme yet.  But again, get over to the poll, answer it so we can settle this once and for all.  Free trial.  Enter your credit card info.  I hate that.  Stop asking me for the credit card info.  And then you forget about it and they charge you $30 a month for however long it takes you to realize it.  Scam.  Don't ever, ever, ever enter your credit card info.  When Zed gets more likes in his first hour than the president on his first day.  That's what I'm talking about, guys.  We are beating the most popular presidents.  in history.  We are in popularity on YouTube.  We're beating them.  I'd love to see it.  Let's keep beating them.  Let's keep spreading this.  Let's keep growing it.  This is hilarious.  Most popular president in history, guys.  How did you do in today's video?  Did you laugh at all?  If you did, you have to go and answer the poll.
