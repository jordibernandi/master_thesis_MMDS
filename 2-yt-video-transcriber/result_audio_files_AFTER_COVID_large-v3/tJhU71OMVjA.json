            "text": "Dr.  Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, must resign or be fired.  She's in a terrible conflict of interest because she works right now for the China-controlled World Health Organization.  I have a petition at www.firetam.com that I'd like you to go to right now and sign and share with your friends.  It's at firetam.com.  In the meantime, let me explain why.  As you may have heard, the World Health Organization covered up the Wuhan virus for the Chinese government.  So they endangered millions of lives around the world by lying on behalf of China's dictatorship.  Look at this example, published by the World Health Organization on January 14th.  where they cite Chinese propaganda that the virus does not spread from person to person, but it does.  It's very contagious.  That false disinformation put the rest of the world at ease and allowed the virus to spread globally.  That WHO lie made us let down our guard and continue accepting flights from Wuhan, China.  It really shouldn't be called the World Health Organization because it doesn't serve the world.  It serves Communist China, who installed the WHO's Secretary General, Tedros Adhanom, who calls himself a doctor but he doesn't actually have a medical degree.  He's the first head of the WHO who isn't really a medical doctor.  When he was a political boss back in Ethiopia, his claim to fame was actually covering up cholera epidemics in his own country.  That's who runs the WHO.  No wonder Donald Trump announced that he's cutting off funding to the WHO. ",

            "text": "And just like the WHO and Communist China, Xi spent January denouncing anyone worried about the virus as racist and told people to shut up.  It's to our national shame that Canada has been deeply involved in the WHO's pro-China biases.  Here's another Canadian doctor, Bruce Aylward, who is the WHO point man on the virus.  He was asked a basic question about the virus and how Taiwan is handling it.  But Taiwan is a country that China despises.  So instead of answering the question like a doctor, he just hung up on the reporter.  This is politics, not medicine.  Would the WHO consider Taiwan's membership?  Hello?  I couldn't hear your question.  Let me repeat the question.  Let's move to another one then.  Yeah, that's a Canadian public health doctor acting as a Chinese political enforcer.  That's just wrong.  That's actually corrupting our doctors and medicine.  Should Canada quit the WHO too?  I think so.  But here's the problem.  The person who would help make that decision is Theresa Tam herself.  Except that she doesn't just take orders from the WHO.  She literally works for it right now.  and not just as some low-ranking bureaucrat.  She's on an important WHO committee in charge of health emergencies around the world.  She's actually on the oversight committee.  You can see she's one of seven people on that committee.  Her name is right there on the bottom right.  So she's actually a boss at the WHO.  It's her job to be a sort of auditor, making sure the WHO does real medicine, not politics.  So the WHO's political corruption happened when it was literally her job to stop it.  It was on her watch.  She didn't stop it.  She either approved of it or was blind to it.  She was one of seven people in the whole world whose job was to make sure that the Chinese Communist Party and its politics didn't derail this emergency.  She didn't do her job.  And she stands by the corrupt WHO to this day.  Who does she even work for?  Canada?  or China's WHO, because you have to choose sides now.  She is in a conflict of interest.  She cannot give Canadians good medical advice because she works for China's WHO.  And she can't give Trudeau good political advice about the WHO because it was she herself who approved their scandalous conduct.  It's impossible for her to be a neutral, objective judge about the WHO's misconduct because she rubber-stamped that misconduct personally on that committee.  She should have resigned the WHO, but she won't, just like Bruce Aylward won't, because they work for China, because they aid and abet China's propaganda.  We have to fire Tam.  If you agree with me, go to firetam.com and forward this video to your friends so they can learn the truth about Theresa Tam and her intolerable conflict of interest.  Canada's public health officer has to work for Canada, not a foreign dictatorship.  Visit FireTam.com to sign our petition.  Thanks.  Theresa Tam works for the corrupt World Health Organization.  She needs to resign or be fired.  Go to FireTam.com and share this video. ",
