Then there's a couple of minutes of John explaining what he does and his qualifications and his experience, things like that, which is all fine.  I have no problem with him.  He obviously has some experience with the AppFleur system and he understands the components.  He even describes some of them by name, like DRO for derotation.  So he's obviously familiar with the fact that they're there.  So let's skip forward to 728, which is where the actual question is asked.  Let's see about there.  So let's see. ",

And just the derotation mechanism by itself obviously isn't going to do that.  All a derotation mechanism does is rotate something.  There has to be something that makes the glare actually rotate separate from the horizon.  So the derotation mechanism, if all we're talking about is the derotation mechanism rotating things, it rotates the entire scene.  so everything in that scene will rotate the same.  The question is how do you get something that rotates the glare relative to the horizon?

And that rotation would make the horizon look like it's at weird angles.  And so they have this derotation mechanism that puts the horizon back where it should be.  So it actually doesn't look like anything is rotating.  It actually looks like the horizon is steady.  This comes into play when the camera is tracking from left to right because if it's over here, It has to be a certain angle and it's over here.

You do kind of have to get into arguments about that, because if it's a glare, then the rotation could be.  the orientation of the glare could be affected by components of the camera.  If, for example, you take a camera like this one here, this is a Canon 7D, and it's got this little 50mm lens in, and it's got this kind of hexagonal, I think octagonal aperture in it, and the glare that you see around lights from that will have these little spikes on in certain directions, like up, down, left, right, and at 45 degrees, blah, blah, blah.  And if you were to rotate the lens, if you'd actually like to press this button here and rotate the entire lens assembly, it actually rotates the glare, the glare itself rotates.  So if there's something in the camera system ahead of the derotation mechanism that is rotating around and causes the glare itself to rotate relative to the horizon, and this is the key point, the glare rotates relative to the horizon.  because we're rotating the camera or part of the camera, and then we do the d rotation then puts the horizon back where it is.  but since the glare has rotated relative to the horizon the glare appears to rotate independently of the horizon.  it's complicated and i know a lot of people uh have trouble with it and i have trouble explaining it to people and it's perfectly understandable people people miss this uh.  but anyway i'm kind of getting ahead of myself here.  let's see what uh john has to say.

So if something is rotating, in the camera then that glare will rotate relative to the horizon or actually really it's more like the horizon rotates relative to the glare and then it rotates the horizon back to where it should be by rotating the entire scene which rotates the glare and the horizon looks like it hasn't moved and the glare looks like it has moved complicated.

            "text": "yeah man absolutely it's like.  That's the conclusion you would reach if you don't think about what is making the shape of the glare rotate.  Why does a glare have a particular shape?  Now if a glare has some kind of diamond shape it could well be because of a diamond shaped aperture or it could be because of the sequence of mirrors it goes through.  He talks a bit about steering mirrors earlier.  It could be something to do with the window that's in front of the camera.  It could be that there's very fine abrasions on the window that make the glare longer in one direction than the other.  You have seen all these things happen with different cameras.  I've seen smudges on the window make the glare go in a certain direction.  what appears to be something to do with the aperture that makes it be oriented in a certain direction.  So these things do happen.  You do get shaped glares.  Glares are not just uniformly round blobs.  Quite often they have spikes up, down, left, right, just like the gimbal has.  If you look at it closely, it has these axial spikes that go that way and then a longer one that way along the long axis of the saucer.  And so if the thing that is causing that shape, the thing that causes these spikes is rotated in front of the derotation mechanism, then the glare is going to rotate relative to the horizon.  Or like I said before, the glare is not rotating, but the horizon is rotating.  Let's see what else we have. ",

Do you think I'm pulling the wool over your eyes by giving you this explanation?  Do you think I'm just an idiot because I don't understand what John is talking about here?  I mean, I think basically... I don't think anything's really changed here.  John basically did the why does the horizon not rotate when the object does rotate?  argument which I explained in my video and nothing really changed.  it's just the same arguments.  and now Jeremy has got another expert who agrees with him another expert who is wrong.  I think this expert, if I was to talk to him, I'd be happy to do so.  Perhaps even just watching this video might do it.  He might understand the actual argument because he seems like he's a pretty smart guy.  So, let's see.  Finish up here. ",
