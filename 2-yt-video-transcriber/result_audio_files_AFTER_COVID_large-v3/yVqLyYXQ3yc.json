            "text": "Hey, welcome back everyone.  We're again here broadcasting from my apartment, and we're continuing our coverage five days a week, Monday through Friday, focused very heavily, for now at least, on this new coronavirus, the CCP virus.  We have a great lineup today.  We're going to be starting off by looking at what's happening right now in Wuhan, the epicenter of the virus, where they're again having a second wave outbreak.  We're also going to be going into the high tech push the Chinese regime had and how this high tech push is being derailed by new bans put in place by the Trump administration.  And we're also going to be looking at some of the new hostilities from the Chinese regime targeting American politicians.  Now that said, folks, before we get started, please don't forget to like and subscribe.  Again, we really need your support.  Also, you want to go the extra mile, we do take donations.  And again, really appreciate it, folks.  Don't get a chance to say thank you individually to everybody, but it's because of you folks that this channel is able to keep going.  First off, we're going to be going into the second wave outbreak in China, something that was originally rumored, then spoken about very kind of vaguely within the Chinese Communist Party, now out in the open.  Now, starting off in Wuhan, which is the epicenter of this virus, where the virus is again now spreading, the Chinese regime has placed orders at 11 million people.  Every single resident there needs to be tested for the virus.  And recent videos from the ground show what these testing stations look like.  We have a video here of an outdoor testing station.  You'll notice people standing very close to each other.  There's not really social distancing guidelines in place.  But what's most significant about this video that's coming from the ground there is that the doctors or the medical workers testing the individuals for this virus are not changing their gloves between testing.  In other words, there is a risk, as some Chinese netizens have pointed out, that these medical workers, if they do test someone who does in fact have the virus, it is possible that every person after them will risk infection as well.  And given this situation, there is concern that the measures put in place by the Chinese regime to reduce the impact of a second wave outbreak may in and of themselves make the outbreak even worse.  Now, there's also videos from Wuhan showing people collapsing on the street.  Of course, when this virus outbreak was first beginning in China, videos like this are fairly common.  There have been a few since then, but now we're seeing it back again happening in Wuhan.  we have here a video of a man laying on the ground and there's a woman standing over him.  she looks like she's either vaguely trying to help him or mourning him and individuals can be seen casually walking by.  many of them are keeping their distance and lockdowns are also already coming back to Wuhan.  A Sanmin residential community in Dongxihu district of Wuhan is currently on lockdown, one of these areas.  Epoch Times actually conducted interviews with some people there.  Now, the Epoch Times is of course blacklisted in mainland China, but we are able to do interviews there.  We are able to get sources on the ground.  And of course, because of our track record of reporting honestly on what's happening in China, whenever people want to get documents, videos out, they tend to come to us.  And so we did speak with some people in this compound.  There's about 5,000 people in 1,000 households, also factories and businesses within this area.  that's within the area of the lockdown.  They have said that some doors in the community have been nailed shut with metal plates.  And residents feel that the behavior of the local authorities is very extreme.  And keep in mind, these are residents in Wuhan who have dealt with the previous lockdown as well.  Them saying that they believe that the behavior, that the actions of local officials are extreme, given that Wuhan was, again, the epicenter of the virus, and of all places in China, had it the worst during the height of the outbreak.  They're saying that the behavior of these officials is making them concerned that the situation may be even worse right now than they're being told.  And it's not just in Wuhan that we're seeing these new outbreaks.  Also in Shulan City in Jilan Province, the situation is getting worse.  Now the CCP declared a wartime state in Jilin on May 10th and the communities there have been locked down, businesses closed, etc.  And also there are cases spreading in Harbin, Heilongjiang, and elsewhere in China right now.  And although the CCP is denying it, this infection allegedly began with a worker at a public bathhouse, which then spread to other individuals and is now spreading across the city.  And while some areas of China are on full lockdown, other areas are implementing stronger forms of social controls.  For example, in Hunan province, the schools recently installed new systems to monitor students.  These are facial recognition technologies and they have these temperature reading programs built into them.  allegedly so they can see if students may have a fever, may have higher temperatures.  But even in China where people don't have a whole lot of say about things like this, these are becoming very controversial.  Now in Hunan, this was part of a program launched jointly by China Unicom and Alibaba And schools there charged every parent an annual fee for the technology.  The parents reported it.  They stood up and made it public.  And another video from the ground in China shows a military hospital in Shenyang is closed down.  And this is significant.  Now what is most interesting about this is this goes beyond normal lockdowns.  This goes beyond normal things to shut down because this is first off a military hospital and again it is a hospital during a pandemic.  In China.  right now, the military in China is not like the American military, where soldiers, for example, are sworn to protect the Constitution.  In China, the PLA, the People's Liberation Army, is sworn to protect the Chinese Communist Party.  It is a party military, not a military meant for the protection of the citizenry or for the values the society is based on.  It is a party military.  And the Chinese regime would not casually shut down any part of that, especially during a time of crisis.  Now from the video it is alleged, at least we can see some of it, that the entire hospital is closed off.  And this is the Shenyang 463 Hospital, which is one of the top hospitals.  And this is causing speculation that the CCP cannot contain the virus.  And with all of this in context, Xi Jinping himself, the head of the Chinese Communist Party, did something that is out of character.  He traveled from Beijing to Shanxi Province to pray to Buddha.  And in China, under the Chinese Communist Party, it is an atheist country.  Praying to Buddha for government officials, especially top-level Chinese Communist Party officials, is not something you normally do.  Some context of this might be that the National People's Congress is going to be held in person in Beijing on May 21st.  You may remember originally they were not going to hold it.  It was going to be a teleconference.  There were reports again that they were going to keep delaying it.  But now that is cancelled.  They're going to be doing it in person.  And there is a lot of speculation that Chinese top-level leadership may be infected with the virus at that conference.  Is Xi Jinping praying about this?  Is he praying about the state of the virus?  Is he praying for something else entirely?  I'm sure only he knows this currently.  Moving on, we have a new chapter in the US-China trade war.  which is that President Donald Trump has extended the ban on Huawei and ZTE, two of the top telecommunications companies in China, for another year, to May 2021.  And for the Chinese Communist Party, this ban is no minor thing.  Huawei in particular is one of the backbones of the One Belt, One Road initiative, one of the core components of China 2025, one of the main objectives of the Chinese Communist Party.  When the Chinese regime goes abroad and builds these critical infrastructures or countries, getting them into debt traps, Huawei is one of the main companies involved in that.  And this entire program could be derailed, if the Chinese regime cannot build this type of critical infrastructure as part of this system.  And, of course, this also takes into account the idea of whether the Chinese regime can continue building a lot of the technologies, these high-tech systems, in China if there are bans on working, for example, with Huawei or ZTE.  Now, President Trump extended this ban for a year using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act for ongoing national security risks to the United States.  But as a possible olive branch to the Chinese regime with this ban, the UK Register is reporting that Trump, quote, also extended an exemption allowing American organizations to continue doing business with the two Chinese vendors such as supplying parts and software until April 1st.  That will be the fifth such extension.  Now if Trump were to get rid of that extension, the one allowing U.S.  companies to supply parts and software, it means that the core piece of technology, such as the semiconductors that these companies need to manufacture a lot of their goods, because the Chinese Communist Party's companies to manufacture semiconductors are not up to modern-day standards, it means that these technologies would be sent back generations.  They would not be able to compete on the global stage.  And within the system, Huawei is trying to rebrand itself, trying to change the way it is perceived.  And this is already beginning to backfire, it seems.  Radio Free Asia reported that Huawei arranged a seminar to discuss the fight against fake news.  But the event was cancelled by a partner within the day of the announcement.  Now the event was going to be co-sponsored by the National Association of Black Journalists, And the association's chair told RFA that Huawei was set to sponsor the event, but noted the association did not receive any agreement with Huawei or take any sponsorship from it.  Now in context of all of this, given this entire situation, the Chinese regime is still pushing its new aggressive propaganda and disinformation campaigns.  along with its new program of wolf warrior diplomacy, this new very hostile form of diplomacy the Chinese regime is using.  One of the latest chapters in this is the CCP has pointed out four US senators who they say they will need to retaliate against and to try to find their pain points and strike them.  The Global Times reports, one of the main Chinese regime media, that on April 14th, US Republican Senator Josh Hawley introduced the Justice for Victims of Coronavirus Act in the Senate And it says this allowed Americans to file private lawsuits against China.  On April 16th, the US Republican Senator Tom Cotton proposed the accountability of the Communist Party of China for infecting Americans in 2020 bill, demanding deprivation of China's sovereign immunity in the United States.  And this article goes on to list different US lawmakers who have called out the Chinese regime, who are calling for investigations into the Chinese regime.  or who are backing lawsuits into the Chinese regime and is calling for the regime to retaliate against them, to find their soft parts and to strike them.  Now very likely this does not mean physical attacks, it very likely means verbal attacks.  But the Chinese regime is engaging again in this new form of wolf warrior diplomacy, this attack formation diplomacy.  And it's also not just American politicians are doing this to.  They're doing this to politicians in Australia.  They're doing this to politicians in New Zealand.  They're doing this to politicians in Europe and different parts of the world.  And in almost every instance, it is backfiring on them.  Now, in addition to this, the Chinese Communist Party has created a new political label to criticize some American politicians.  And the word they've used for it is very, very long.  I'll read it to you.  It is, distorted thoughts, misguided roads, mistakes and dereliction of duty, evasion of responsibility, misjudgment, mishandling, coping with misconduct, scraping the pot to blame, provoking confrontation, robbery of materials, breaking the supply of the world.  health, people and gods are indignant, ghosts are obsessed, rumors are smeared, cooked mouths blow lights, and an evil spirit.  That is the new label that they have for these different US politicians who are being deemed enemies and targets of the Chinese regime because they are either calling for investigations into the Chinese regime, calling out the Chinese regime for its handling of this virus, or backing lawsuits against it.  And again, this new wolf warrior diplomacy that the Chinese regime is launching is backfiring.  It is having the opposite effect.  Taiwan's central news agency is reporting that, quote, \"...criticism of Chinese wolf warrior diplomacy scholars.  It only brings  counter-effects.\".  Now folks, what do you think about the current situation in China?  Are they facing a second wave outbreak?  Is something else going on?  And when it comes to the Chinese regime's new form of wolf warrior diplomacy, how do you see your local politicians reacting to it?  What are you seeing in your local areas in terms of the way they're positioning themselves?  Are they folding to the pressure or are they standing up against it?  Is it having the effect the Chinese regime desires or is it having the opposite effect?  Let me know what you think.  And of course, folks, again, we're going to be doing these broadcasts five days a week, Monday through Friday.  And if you want to join the live discussions when we premiere the videos, we do the YouTube premiere 10.30 p.m.  Eastern Time, Monday through Friday.  So you can feel free to join.  Of course, folks, thanks again.  Really appreciate the support.  Please take care of yourselves.  Stay healthy.  I'll see you next time. ",
