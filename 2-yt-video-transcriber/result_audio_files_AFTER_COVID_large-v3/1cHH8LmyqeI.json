            "text": "Depending on your vintage, you may have been introduced to a chapter in the Bible by the group The Birds and the song Turn, Turn, Turn.  And of course, there you have it.  In Ecclesiastes chapter 3, there's a time to be born, there's a time to die.  It just chronicles life, something with which we can all identify.  And so here we find ourselves at a particular point in time and may find ourselves with more time on our hands than we've had before and may find ourselves saying, well, what am I supposed to do?  And of course, there are many things that we can do, but the Bible actually helps us.  When Paul writes to the Thessalonians as he gets towards the end of his letter, he says to them, now let me tell you what the will of God is for you.  And he gives them three straightforward directives.  And that is, we should rejoice always, we should pray without ceasing, and we should give thanks at all times.  So, prayerful, thankful, joyful.  Not necessarily easy, but by the help of the Holy Spirit, we can perhaps endeavor to live out those principles today.  There's a time to laugh, there's a time to cry, but it's always time.  It's always the time to rejoice, to give thanks to God, and to be prayerful.  Let me encourage you along those lines, even as I encourage myself. ",
