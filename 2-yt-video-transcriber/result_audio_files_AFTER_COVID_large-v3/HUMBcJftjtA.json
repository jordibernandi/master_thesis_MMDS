Just wanted to let you know.  if you haven't done it already, please go ahead and subscribe.  Apparently, if I don't put that call to action at the beginning of videos, YouTube will actually smite me.  Anyways, if you aren't new here, you know the drill.  We're gonna do fan art, and then we're gonna get into the video itself.  So first, we have a snail Cerys from Draconic Reign, what looks to be a Rule 63 Cerys from the back by IamOddity, and yet more Rule 63 Cerys by BumblinBee.  I also want to shout something out really quick before I actually get started.  As some of you may know, the backgrounds I use in my videos are from World of Warcraft.  I physically go into Warcraft Classic and take some captures myself.  A user on the Mancric server named Tappensap actually helped me get a few of these recently.  So I just wanted to give that very quick shoutout before we get into the video itself.  Alright, now that that's out of the way, let's begin! ",

But you do realize that when you're asking people to set an example like that, you're telling them to effectively live a lie, so that they look happy enough that other people will buy into that lie, and then live the lie as well.  And you sell the message that people should live this lie through shaming them that they are not living the lie well enough.  I'm fairly certain that the Christians in my audience at this point are uncomfortable with your message. ",

            "text": "No, I don't believe.  And you've actually given me more reasons not to believe in the particular brand and flavor of God that you believe in.  So let's recap.  What you've effectively done here is you've said that people should believe in your God.  And if they believed in your God, they would believe that they couldn't suffer from anxiety and depression.  And then you think that the thing that's entailed from that is that they wouldn't suffer from them, because apparently believing that these things can't affect you is enough to not suffer from them.  And even if they did suffer from them, the reason they shouldn't worry about that is because their perspective should be changed where their anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation is concerned.  And that perspective is changed because one day they'll be able to go to heaven.  But you've effectively told the person who you recognize has an issue with suicidal ideation that their problem won't be fixed until they're dead.  Because the light at the end of the tunnel you've given them is literally the light at the end of the tunnel.  or you've at least dismissed any problems they have currently on Earth right now, because it's more important that the light at the end of the tunnel exists for them.  But as somebody who's struggled with suicidal ideation before, I'm gonna go ahead and let you know right now, telling people that things will get better when they die, when they have suicidal issues, is almost abusive.  I say almost abusive because you're telling people through a parasocial relationship, but if you were saying this to somebody you knew in real life, and it wasn't just through a parasocial relationship like what we have here on YouTube, then I'd say that not only is your argument disgusting, which I already think it is, but you're basically being an abuser at that point.  You're telling somebody who is struggling with the idea that they might need to die to solve their problems that their problems are solved after they're dead.  I don't think you've actually thought about the fact that your poem literally leads to that conclusion.  I don't even have to take it out of context or overanalyze it for that.  You've given the light at the end of the tunnel.  And it's at this point that I realized that I may not have the command of the English language.  I thought I did because I can't think of anything besides light at the end of the tunnel.  I keep using that phrase.  There's got to be something else.  I don't know.  Let me know in the comment section below.  Anyways, that's about all I've got for this video.  I think the message is pretty repulsive, and I've detailed my reasons why.  I'm not arguing that this was Morgan's intent, but I am arguing that these are the consequences of their actions.  Anyways, with that all said, if you guys enjoyed the video, please leave a like, hit the subscribe button if you haven't already, maybe support me on Patreon if you want to do that.  That would be kind of cool.  And past that, I hope you're all having a wonderful day today.  As always, everyone, insert end of video tagline here.  Cause every night I will save your life And every night I will be with you.  Cause every night I still lay awake and I dream Of an absolution.  Cause every night I will make it right And every night I will come to you But every night it just stays the same in my dream. ",
