On the back it says that if you push her tummy right here, sorry it's glaring, if you push her tummy right here she makes 10 phrases and sounds and that's all it talks about when it comes to the little comb.  So I mean she does all that.  You touch her tummy and she makes little singing sounds and She's super cute.  Well, I'm showing her to my husband and I heard some other sounds that I had never heard before.  And if you look down here, I figured a video was the best way.  So I just touched her tummy and she's gonna sing for a minute.  But down here is a button right here on her privates.  And if you push those, she makes these sounds.  like a gasping sound and i know some of you may not like think this is a big deal but especially since i've had kids like this is wrong for one.  this button it says nothing about this button on the box nothing it's just.  it's just there and it makes a gasping sound when you touch your privates.  and to me it's just like sexual sounds and it's so disturbing and i got online to see if like there had been kind of any complaints.  you cannot find this doll on walmart.
