He was born with this pre-existing condition, and to know that he's going to have to deal with this for the rest of his life.  If I could take it from him, I would.  If President Trump continues his assault on the ACA, eliminating the protections for those with pre-existing conditions, what's this going to look like for families like ours?  It completely baffles me that you would look to attack any part of healthcare.  Donald Trump is looking to roll back those protections for pre-existing conditions in the middle of a pandemic.  It's mind-blowing.  Joe Biden has a genuine interest in the struggles that people have with healthcare costs and pre-existing conditions.  I just want Anthony to live a long, healthy life.  That's it.  I'm Joe Biden, and I approve this message. ",
