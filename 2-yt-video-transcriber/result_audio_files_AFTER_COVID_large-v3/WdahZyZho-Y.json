            "text": "I have a message that I've titled, Will Trump Fulfill the Prophecies from the 1800s?  What am I talking about?  After the Civil War, there was a group of people.  They were elders and people that believed, of course, in the Lord Jesus Christ.  They believed in visions and dreams that went to prayer and fasting concerning the United States.  When they began to get together and began to share some of the dreams that they were having, there were about seven or eight points, I haven't counted exactly here, maybe more than that, maybe closer to nine or ten, that seem to be a common theme.  Now in 2010 in Griffin, Georgia, I shared this information.  It actually came from a book and I apologize for not being able to give you the title because I packed this book up in probably 2011 and I have literally 60 to 80 boxes of books packed up in a warehouse and could not tell you what box that book is in.  BUT I DO KNOW THAT THE INDIVIDUAL WHO WROTE IT HAD BEEN A JOURNALIST WITH THE NEW YORK TIMES.  AND HE HAD RESEARCHED ALL OF THIS.  AND I JUST REALLY WAS FASCINATED BY IT.  AND NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME, IT APPEARS IT COULD BE COMING TO PASS.  AND I BELIEVE IT'S POSSIBLE.  AND THE REASON I SAY POSSIBLE IS BECAUSE UNLESS I HEAR FROM THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD, When I hear from him, I make it definite.  But when I just get information, I leave it in the realm of possibilities that President Trump, and I still call him President Trump, not former president, I still call him President Trump, may fulfill what I'm about to tell you.  Now, what I'm going to do is share with you the visions and dreams that occurred with this group of people after the Civil War.  And remember, these were written down in the 1800s.  This is not something someone just came up with.  These are well, well over, well over 100 and, oh my goodness, I'd have to go back and add up the years, probably somewhere in the neighborhood of 130 years of age, total, or 130 years old.  First, there will be internal fighting among families as predicted by Christ in the New Testament.  Well, the political division, if nothing else, is causing that.  There will not be one big war, but there will be fighting that will spread to the states, cities and neighborhoods throughout America.  Now, we've already seen that with protesters, especially on the West Coast.  And I think it was Minnesota and all these Wisconsin, all these other places.  Number three, this is what one of the elders said, I've seen the end of this nation and it is terrible.  A secret band.  will sap the life out of this nation, a secret band, which that word band there means group.  We would call it today, I think, the deep state.  Manufacturing will cease for a time.  Even farmers will allow their land to remain fallow.  Now, whether you believe this or not, you can research where some farmers didn't even farm because they didn't have the money to do it because of the debts they owed either on their equipment.  So they just let the land, not a lot at this point, but there were some.  The sea will heave itself beyond its bounds, engulfing cities.  Earthquakes, hail, and rain will bring destruction.  We've seen that already.  And I think the sea heaving itself may actually allude to some future tsunamis, which is something that I've actually seen in dreams and visions.  It's very troubling when you experience something like that.  MOBS WILL ROAM THE CITIES LOOKING FOR MONEY AND FOOD AND DESTROYING ANYONE WHO OPPOSED THEM.  NOW WE'VE NOT SEEN THEM LOOKING FOR MONEY AND FOOD, BUT WE HAVE SEEN MOBS ROAMING THE CITIES, BURNING THE BUSINESSES AND THE CARS AND CAUSING CHAOS.  NOW THIS ONE IS VERY INTERESTING.  THE INDIANS, AND THEY WERE NOT TALKING HERE ABOUT THE NATIVE AMERICANS, THEY ACTUALLY WERE TALKING ABOUT THE HISPANIC COMMUNITY IN THE SOUTH WILL RAISE UP AND CHALLENGE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.  And that has been done with what we call the illegal immigration, with illegal immigrants and things of that nature.  And I won't elaborate on that.  I think those of you who, you know, watch the news and keep up with things can see it.  The next one is, this is it right here.  Listen carefully.  The government will abuse the Constitution, go in severe debt, and they will actually eventually flee because of safety concerns.  NOW YOU'VE SEEN THEM CONFRONT PEOPLE OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS IN RESTAURANTS, GO TO THEIR HOME AND PROTEST, AND NOW IT'S BEING REVERSED.  WHERE THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE CONSIDERED TO BE, SOME CONSIDER THEM TO BE TRADERS OR WHATEVER, ARE BEING CONFRONTED IN AIRPORTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT.  INTERNAL FIGHTING WILL CAUSE THE COLLAPSE OF THE FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS.  NOW LISTEN TO THAT LAST ONE.  INTERNAL FIGHTING WILL CAUSE THE COLLAPSE OF FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS.  Now, we do know that historically democracies do not last forever.  And it has been predicted for quite some time that the democracy in America would not last forever.  And I'm not either saying it will or it won't.  That's not what I'm here to share with you.  I want to share with you these visions and dreams.  And all of this, again, was in the 1800s, post-Civil War, after the Civil War.  All right.  Now, here was one of them that I've got to tell you about.  that I think may be connected to President Trump.  They predicted that the Constitution would be trampled under, which it has been and will be in the future.  There will be a group of people raised up in the United States forming an organization or a group, it's a major group, to restore the Constitution and demand a new government be elected.  Woo-hoo!  The 1800s, this word was given.  Now, again, these were visions and dreams that people were having.  And I want to say it again.  A new group of people were raised up to restore the Constitution and demand a new... Now, the restoring of the Constitution, I can understand that because groups like the Tea Party were pro-constitutional.  But that last part of demanding a new government... that the government was so corrupt.  They said, we demand a new government.  And it has to be, it would have to be in the tens and tens and tens and tens and tens of millions of people before that would happen.  It has been reported that President Trump is possibly going to form a new political party, a pro-Constitution party.  And I don't think he knows anything about this or anything about these predictions.  I wish somebody would share that with him.  And this new political party that would raise up the United States would be pro-Constitution.  Now, THE THING THAT'S HAPPENING NOW, AND I'M SAYING THIS FROM SOMEONE WHO IS 61 YEARS OF AGE, BEEN MINISTRYING FOR ALMOST 46 YEARS, WHO LIVED, WHOSE FAMILY, MY DAD PASTORED OUTSIDE OF WASHINGTON, D.C.  FOR MANY YEARS.  I BELIEVE THAT THIS DIVISION THAT YOU SEE IS VERY CLEAR, PRO-CONSTITUTION, PRO-FREEDOM, PRO-FAITH, versus atheism, Marxism, communism, silencing people.  And it happened in Germany.  It happened in Russia.  And the people, of course, the Russian Revolution was different because the Bolshevik Revolution was the common people raising up, but it led to communism, which sounded good at the time but was terribly detrimental.  Fascism that came through Hitler is more what we're seeing with shutting down the radio, shutting down the bank accounts, shutting people out of their jobs, firing them because of their different ideas and beliefs.  That's happening all over.  And if these groups... Christians who love the word and know the word, conservatives, Christians and patriots.  And there are a lot, especially in the South, South Midwest, Midwest.  I don't want to say too much about that.  I know a good bit about some of those homies in the Midwest, but in the South as well, in the Southeast.  There's probably somewhere in the neighborhood, in my estimate, of 40 states that I think are pro-constitution and 10 states that just have large cities that people pay no attention because they don't think that what is happening is going to impact them, where the cities will be impacted.  WILL BE WITH NATURAL DISASTERS.  NOW LISTEN TO ME.  MARK THIS DOWN.  YOU'LL COME BACK TO THIS.  MAYBE IF THIS VIDEO IS UP IN YEARS FROM NOW, MONTHS, I DON'T KNOW.  YOU'LL COME BACK TO THIS.  BUT THERE WILL BE CITIES.  THAT WILL COME UNDER NATURAL DISASTERS.  AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE CITIES.  THAT IF THEY KEEP PASSING THE LAWS THEY'RE GETTING READY TO PASS.  I MEAN, IF THEY... BIDEN HAS SIGNED IN shutting down the Keystone, which lost 10,000 jobs.  And if it goes to the $15 an hour minimum wage, which sounds great, you lose 3.7 to about 7 million jobs from small businesses, restaurants, fast food chains that cannot afford, you know, your hamburger instead of being a hamburger, fries and a drink for $5 is going to go up to $10 at McDonald's.  You can't survive that.  You cannot make it.  Small businesses cannot make it, especially if you're paying insurance.  So I understand it.  And those who are economists have warned this could be... Sounds great.  I think it would be great if everybody could get that.  I really do.  But from a practical perspective, when you are paying bills, insurance salaries plus the bills to own a business, it just doesn't pan out.  So... President Trump may be fulfilling these predictions from the post-Civil War of the 1800s by forming a new political party.  And I'll be honest, it frightens the party that he's connected with right now.  But at the same time, it gives you a leverage in the future to say our group of politicians LET ME JUST USE A FICTITIOUS NUMBER, 25 TO 30 TO 50 MILLION.  PEOPLE WHO ARE A PART OF MY ORGANIZATION DO NOT BELIEVE IN WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO DO.  IT WILL AFFECT THE PEOPLE, SO WE'RE NOT VOTING FOR YOU.  THEN THAT'S HOW THE OTHER SIDE PUTS PRESSURE ON THEIR PEOPLE.  You know, someone was sharing with me the other day that the Keystone Pipeline was on Obama's desk for a long time, and he actually thought it would be a good idea for America, but he wouldn't sign it because pressure came from the party that he's connected to.  So anyway, we will see in time to come.  But the reason I think that this part... that talks about the state and federal governments collapsing with internal fighting and the abuse of the Constitution, the communities in the South raising up, and that would be at the border, because we can see it coming or we're seeing it in early stages.  So why wouldn't the rest of this come to pass as well?  So there you have it.  Time will tell.  But I wanted to share this with you.  I think it's very interesting and very intriguing.  And someone says, well, how do we know when someone has given us a dream or a vision that it's from the Lord?  And the answer is if it comes to pass.  And sometimes visions and dreams are timed and people give a date.  And when it doesn't happen, you just have to admit they missed it or they have to admit they missed it.  But at times when there's not a time element there.  then it could be, you know, if this were in the 1800s, it could be far off into the future.  So the Bible says we don't despise prophecy, but we have to judge it.  And I don't want to get into the rules and the laws of judging prophetic words.  That's another day, another time.  But thank you for joining me.  I would suggest to you at the end of every telecast, there will be a special announcement of a resource that we're beginning to put up on our program.  So please take the time to watch it because I may have something that you would be very interested in.  And it helps support our global ministry.  Our ministry is not just in America.  It's all the way around the world.  And, of course, we need the Christians and those who believe our message, even the American patriots and all of our good friends up in the mountains.  And I use that term.  you know, in respect toward, I consider them family, to continue to pray for us, of course, primarily, and when you can, help us to continue to do what we're doing.  Thank you for your time.  See you next time. ",
