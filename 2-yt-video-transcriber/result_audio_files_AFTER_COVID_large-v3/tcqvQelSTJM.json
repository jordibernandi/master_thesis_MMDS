They were right next to the media, but we really could hardly hear too much.  We heard a sound, but it wasn't very strong.  What do you think the peaceful protesters are fighting for?  Well, I think that peaceful protest is, number one, it's Fine to do that in a peaceful manner But when it gets least when it gets less than peaceful as you see all over then it's unacceptable.  And that's where law and order is necessary.  And that's where law enforcement is very important. ",

I travel with the president all across the country, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Florida, Nevada, and everywhere we go.  The streets are lined with support like I don't think any other president has had previously.  But with regard to precedent, as I've noted before, 29 times has an appointment been made in an election year 29 times.  That was all 29 times when there was a vacancy at hand.  So the precedent is very much on our side here.  And I would also note the hypocrisy of Democrats.  Joe Biden saying I would go forward with the confirmation process as chairman even a few months before an election.  Barack Obama saying fill the Supreme Court vacancy when it was his tenure.  And you had Kamala Harris saying as well that Senate GOP is holding SCOTUS hostage for political gain, join me in calling them to consider President Obama's nominees.  They've really flipped here because the president is on our side and their hypocrisy is on full display. ",
