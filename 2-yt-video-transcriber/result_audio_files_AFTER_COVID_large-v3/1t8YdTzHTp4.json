I want to find a funny joke told by a feminist comedian and laugh at it.  You will fail.  That's my goal in life.  That's the only thing I want to achieve before I die.  I've done everything else.  that I want to do, sadly enough.  This is the last thing.  So first we tried Samantha Bee.  That was a miserable failure.  It didn't work out.  So today we're gonna bring out the big guns, Hannah Gadsby.  Okay, Hannah Gadsby is the acclaimed, beloved, critical darling, the best feminist comedian currently on the scene, I'm told.  So we're gonna watch some of her clips and see if we can do this.  You know, can I laugh at a Hannah Gadsby joke?  Can we laugh?  Let's find out together.  Come along, friends.  Forget I did that, sorry. ",

I don't know.  She is a comedian, right?  So there's supposed to be some humor, but it's not really happening.  Instead, she's just venting about a perceived personal slight.  I feel like this is 2003 and I'm listening to somebody read their live journal entry to me out loud.  And can I just say, for the record, for all you women out there, just so you know, a Actually, you are not being specially targeted when people tell you to smile.  You really aren't.  Men do get the same thing all the time.  So Hannah says, no one would ever say this to a man.  Yes, they would.  Actually, they do.  People say it to me all the time.  If you can imagine, I don't like it.  It's annoying.  But then again, I don't like it when anyone says anything to me about anything ever.  So I'm not the best judge.  But the only reason why you ladies think that the smile thing is sexist and that you're being specially targeted is that you ladies are the only ones whining about it.  Now I'm going to go off on my own harangue.  There are many things that feminists complain about where they think that women are the only ones that deal with it.  No, it's not that women are the only ones that deal with it.  It's just that women are the only ones who complain about it all the time.  Everybody else, we just keep it to ourselves.  So, you know, when someone says that to a man, we just shrug it off and go about our day.  Meanwhile, someone says it to Hannah Gadsby and she does a Netflix special about it.  My God, this is pettiness on steroids.  And I say that as someone who has written multiple thousand plus word articles complaining about people who don't put their shopping carts away in grocery store parking lots.  There is no greater evidence of the disintegration of human society than shopping carts that people just leave all over a parking lot.  So I know something about petty whining, and this outdoes even me.  All right, let's try another one. ",

I don't mean to get into conspiracy theories here, conspiracy theories, but I simply don't believe that the audience is laughing that hard at that joke.  I don't, there is no way.  It's a Harry Potter reference, right?  This is how in touch I am with the youth of today.  Slytherin's a Harry Potter.  So there's no way that a Harry Potter reference could cause someone to break into uncontrollable fits of laughter.  I don't believe it.  The physical reaction doesn't make sense.  It would be like if someone responded with orgasmic delight after taking a bite out of like a graham cracker or something.  There's no way that a graham cracker could elicit that sort of response.  Unless you were starving in the desert for two weeks and then you had a graham cracker, then maybe it would have that kind of reaction.  So were these people, were they locked in a dungeon and not allowed to laugh on pain of torture for two years?  And then could that explain it?  Because then I guess you'd be so pleased that you're allowed to laugh that you would laugh even at a Hannah Gadsby Harry Potter reference.  So maybe that's the secret of her success, that she requires her audience to be chained in a dungeon for 24 months prior to attending her performance.  I don't know.  A lot of people, people have different theories.  That's mine.  Who knows?  Anyway, all I'm saying is that I actually want to laugh and that That is not... This is called try to laugh.  And I'm trying to laugh, but I can't laugh at that.  At least not that much.  The most that that joke could really get out of a normal person is sort of like a... Oh, Harry Potter.  Oh, from Harry Potter, right.  Sure, sure, yeah.  I get it, yeah.  Funny, funny.  That's one of those jokes where you have to say your reaction because you can't actually exhibit it.

She's gone back to the lesbian well again.  We're not going to hold that against her.  We're past that now.  That's all she's got.  Talk about what you know.  This is what she knows and pretty much only this.  Fine.  But I like the joke because it's a joke.  It's an actual joke from a comedian.  And so that's progress.  We're getting somewhere.  Okay, now let's see if she can finally take us home. ",

Go back to the last shot there, the still shot of her and the audience.  Hannah says she's on the margins.  She's marginalized.  No, you're not.  That's not what marginalized looks like.  You have a Netflix deal.  You're not marginalized.  You should be marginalized as an unfunny comedian.  That should be a marginalized demographic, but it's not.  I mean, that's one of the most lucrative demographics going right now.  You're the opposite of marginalized.  There's a whole audience of people who are watching.  They paid money to watch you for some reason.  I don't know why.  I don't know why they'd pay money for that.  Then again, people used to pay Jack Kevorkian.  And actually, I'm kind of suspecting it's a very similar audience.  But you're not marginalized.  You're just not.  That's all.  Get over it.  So I failed this challenge, but it's not my fault.  Like any good millennial, I refuse to take responsibility for this whatsoever.  I tried to laugh, but I'm leaving infuriated and annoyed, which is exactly how I went in, to be honest with you.  It's how I live every day of my life.  So maybe that's part of the problem.  But the point is, I am a victim for having endured this.  I am also now marginalized.  And you're a victim too.  So, which is a good thing to be these days.  So you're welcome.  You know, the Matt Wall Show, it's not just another show about politics.  I think there are enough of those already out there.  We talk about culture because culture drives politics and it drives everything else.  So my main focuses are life, family, faith.  Those are fundamental.  And that's what this show is about.  I hope you'll give it a listen. ",
