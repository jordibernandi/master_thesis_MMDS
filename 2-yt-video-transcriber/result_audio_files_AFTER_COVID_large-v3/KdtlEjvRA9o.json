            "text": "This is so structurally very bullish.  And I do want to pick up on Basel III thread.  But just put, let's first put, this is very important to put the catch 22 trade that is going to provide this massive put under the gold and silver market going forward.  And this picks up on one of the threads from our last interview, the Catch-22 arbitrage trade, as this also t-bones the LBMA attempts to delay the implementation of the Basel III NSFR standards.  We looked at this arbitrage trade in more detail last time, but this new constraint upon the house is backed up by what we're evidencing in the wholesale market, which is really important.  And this is important as it is just one more of the jigsaw pieces that radically changed the paper to fizzle game as we move into the second quarter.  This is unprecedented and history making.  Now, COMEX market making insiders will need to avoid triggering backwardations large enough to activate this Catch-22 arbitrage trade.  Now, Chris, as you probably know, Swiss refineries are backlogged for both gold and silver.  We're waiting weeks.  Premiums for immediate delivery are required in order to front run orders stacked for processing into an extremely backlogged refinery hopper.  And of course, it's not just COVID.  This is actually strong demand.  into the fact that there's a slowdown at the refinery spot.  So really, size for immediate delivery comes at a very large premium to spot.  So for, let me give you an idea from a wholesale market perspective, from anything over three to five tons, we have benchmarked sufficient information to determine that this is currently commanding at a minimum two to 3% charge over spot.  Now, that's quite a lot, and by historical standards, and we're talking three to five tonnes here, but larger central bank and sovereign-sized central bank demand commands significantly higher premiums.  Now, physical cannot be magicked out of thin air.  And with such large discounts to fair value, a race into physical will drive the offer to sell bullion higher.  Hence, the strong sovereign and central bank spot index buying we're evidencing with the first year market making bullion banks hanging onto their coattails for dear life for their own books.  Now, this condition is providing this unseen massive put under the market.  Now, the tight supply and premiums for physical will govern how deep officials are willing to offer technically deliverable COMEX registered inventory for sale.  Now, if it is sufficiently backwardated, it will be drawn down.  And if you remember, in November, we uncovered that $40 premiums were required to pay off the 10 tons that were not held by insiders.  the 10 tons that were required for delivery.  So in other words, for them to not take delivery, these fully paid up.  COMEX long holders were settled for cash.  And the reason it was $40 was it was the exact premium required to access 10 tons of bullion accessible for immediate delivery in the global market, which is pretty close to the percentages we just talked about.  Since November, insiders have been very careful not to exceed 90 cents to a dollar backwardations through the entire sell-off.  Now, officials and agent insiders have avoided triggering this Catch-22 arbitrage trade.  And that's the sole reason the new year seller failed to get more traction.  And, you know, you need a minimum of 180 to $2 backwardation to really, to trigger a physical buyer to, that would cover off delivery and transportation friction.  So, you know, by keeping it under that level, you're kind of, that is where the put, the formula for the put sits.  However, into dips last year, if you remember last Friday's chart painting and the Monday capitulative rinse, February futures did flash dip into an actionable backwardation, which is interesting because I know there were a lot of people And we all look to see if anyone got filled.  No one got filled.  It's really important to keep in mind that, as we know, these COMEX inventories are being sought after, but they're structurally re-hypothecated and deliveries, as we know, represent little more than paperwork shuffled among market-making insiders.  And so what is notable is that on each occasion gold futures dipped into an actionable $2 backwardation, it was immediately flash covered within one to two seconds.  Now, in other words, futures were brought by the house to cover.  Now, it's really, really odd because it should be first in, first out.  But for these guys, for nobody, I know that there are several, several major players sitting here ready to jump on that trade.  We invited the Sharks in.  We went over Twitter.  We went everywhere saying, come on in, guys.  Come in on this trade.  This is a perfect way to get yourself 2%, 3%, 4% over gold.  and be settled for cash.  And you don't even have to take delivery.  And so this is really strange that when you have a first in first out, when you really, these guys should have got filled.  No one that we spoke to, and we did go and call everyone around, no one got filled.  Now, so it's suspicious.  Now this disciplining effect really though is the sole reason gold was not able to be rinsed through the gold futures 1800 level.  Round numbers are always targeted.  And that was despite the downside momentum ignition in to paper thin conditions.  So it's important to be aware of this governing factor.  The game of who blinks first has changed.  Insiders have no gold warrants they can convert into physical deliveries, while the house insiders in the crosshairs to deliver these warrants cannot afford to cash settle another failure to deliver.  And as we said last time, the sharks are circling for another risk-free getaway.  so really the only question is how much of the backwardated conditions were covered off by insiders and how much was auto triggered by the catch-22 trade?  now we know none were that.  we could see that this will become clearer by monday ahead of the february.  26 options expiry next tuesday.  but one thing for sure The physical market actors will be seeking to capitalize on any follow through momentum selling.  So this is why the put exists.  So really, this leads into Basel III and some of the most recent questions around this.  And as we discussed last time, Basel III net stable funding ratio standards coming into the front burner in March will begin to devalue unallocated gold.  and begin to treat physical gold at very close to an equivalent cash asset.  Now, given unallocated gold receives an 85% haircut, this is a game changer and leads into a clearly sanctioned gold revaluation.  Now, this timing jives with 2500 gold revaluation target assessed by most of the first tier banks.  And there's been a lot of discussion around the LBMA's attempt to halt and failing that effort, try to delay the implementation of Basel III initiative.  However, most importantly, it is not the case as far as the US, Switzerland and the EU is concerned, all of which will implement the 85% haircut on unallocated gold by June the 28th.  That's a major important effect because given physical goals fungibility and that the primary global physical trading hubs and refineries are centered in Switzerland and Europe, and that all the market-making LBMA bullion banks also have physical presence in the EU and Switzerland, like at Olympic, they will largely be exposed to these standards at the same date.  Now, this will impact the hundreds of tons of unallocated gold cleared every day by the LPMCL.  these member banks that belong to that are part of that clearing process as it opens up a massive arbitrage opportunity for a physically starved market at current prices.  So, only a higher gold price will incentivize more bullion to be put on offer in the first place.  So, Also, the LBMA member banks exposed to EU and Swiss compliance will not be able to shuffle paper position for settlement if it is not backed by physical, if it's moving into those jurisdictions.  It's not the case right now.  So there's a big change coming.  And even if COVID-19 delays the fall, I mean, what an excuse, really.  That's absolute crock.  But even if that was used an excuse to delay the full implementation of Basel III in the UK.  The cat's out of the bag.  With at least a $500 gold price anticipated into the second quarter, we're going to see first-tier banks adding to their net long books.  And it's already obvious that no one is naked short gold.  Furthermore, way into this, the bullish wave, there's the spec paper gold and silver open interest.  that you would need to cover into is actually running extremely thin at the same time.  So these rules will extinguish and force to mark to market any unallocated gold contracts that are not closed or squared by June 28th.  UK aside, but as we've explained, UK are caught in a noose.  Now, the closing of billions of dollars of unbacked unallocated gold contract is required to comply with Basel III net stable funding ratio.  And this is required.  ahead of this, what we feel is going to be this sanctioned and very necessary gold price revaluation.  And there is no coincidence that the BIS needed to implement this despite all the lobbying. ",

There were some great things he talked about, including for everybody out there wondering, is the silver manipulation ever going to end?  We just saw Trump come and go.  Nothing changed whatsoever.  Well, that's exactly what we talked about and some other wild stuff, including if we can sue JP Morgan together.  So hit the subscribe button and the notification bell.  So that way, when that is released, you will be the first person to see it.  The land of Arcadia. ",
