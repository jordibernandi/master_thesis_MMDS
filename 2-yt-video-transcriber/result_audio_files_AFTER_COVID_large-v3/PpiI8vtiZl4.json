And we're seeing this pattern in Democratic city after Democratic city.  But the worst in the country right now is Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where they're not allowing the election observers in.  Despite clear state law that requires election observers being there, despite an order from a state judge saying election observers have to be within six feet of the ballot counting, they're just ignoring the law.  They're defying the law.  And there's a reason they're doing that.  There's a reason they're defying the law.  The reason you don't want observers there is because you're doing something you don't want to be observed.  And I am angry, and I think the American people are angry, because by throwing the observers out, by clouding the vote counting in a shroud of darkness, they are setting the stage to potentially steal an election, not just from the president\u2014 But from the over 60 million people across this country who voted for him, all across this country, it is lawless, and they need to follow the law.

The media is acting as an apologist for what's going on here.  Sean, how come it's just the big Democratic cities that can't seem to figure out how to count a damn vote?  You know, the state of Texas counted over 11 million votes and we got it done and we got it completed.  And yet Philadelphia and yet Detroit and yet Las Vegas, they sit in a darkened room in Detroit.  They covered up the windows so no one could look at them.  And it is only the hard Democratic cities where they know what the total is, that they got to get the votes, that they got to try to beat the president.  And they don't want anyone watching them.  It is outrageous.  I talked with the president this afternoon, Sean, and I'll tell you, the president is angry and I'm angry and the voters ought to be angry.  And if the media had a shred of integrity, they should be angry, too, that there's no transparency.  This is happening under the cloak of darkness with their apologizing for us.  But, you know, I am more than a little frustrated that every time they close the doors and shut out the lights, they always find more Democratic votes.  It's, you know, 20 years ago, we had Bush versus Gore, the recount.  And I was part of George W. Bush's legal team.  And we saw that pattern.  Every time there was a recount, somehow, magically, there were more Gore votes and more Gore votes and more Gore votes.  It was always the Democrats that would keep on finding votes.  There we had the Chads.  And it was our belief that they were just sitting there poking out new chads with their fingernails and they were willing to steal the election.  The answer really is don't give them the opportunity to steal the election. ",

And, you know, at a time when so many people distrust the process, distrust our democratic system, refusing to allow transparency.  Let me give you an example.  If someone goes in, say, to a bank and cuts off the security system and cuts off the cameras, is it because they just intend to deposit a check?  Or is it because they intend to break the law?  But when these guys, when these partisan operatives throw the observers out, the natural inference, which any court of law would take, the natural inference, if you don't want anyone seeing what you're doing, is that you intend to break the law.  And the consequences here aren't just a Philadelphia City Council election, but it is the presidency of the United States.  And it is ridiculous that this is occurring right now. ",
