            "text": "O holy night, the stars are brightly shining.  It is the night of our dear Savior's birth.  Long lay the world in sin and error, till he appeared and the soul felt its worth.  A thrill of hope.  the weary world rejoices for yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.  your knees O hear the angel voices.  O night divine.  O night when Christ was born.  O night Divine.  O night O holy night.  Truly.  He taught us to love one another.  His law is love, and his gospel is peace.  Chains shall he break, for the slave is our brother, and in his name all oppression shall cease.  sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we with all our hearts.  we praise his holy name.  Christ is the Lord.  We'll praise His name forever.  His power and glory evermore proclaim And glory evermore proclaim. ",
