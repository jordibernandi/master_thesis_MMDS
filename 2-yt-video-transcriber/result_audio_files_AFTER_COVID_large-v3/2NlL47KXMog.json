            "text": "Hi there, it's me, peter slash ephel.  I imagine this video is a bit of a surprise to some people who don't follow the channel on either Facebook, Twitter or Patreon.  Then again, maybe not since I've been gone for the past several weeks.  Which is really what I wanted to talk about.  Where I've been and why there's been no new content.  So, here it goes.  On Tuesday the 24th of March, my family lost a beloved member to COVID-19.  My great-aunt Nell had been admitted to hospital on Sunday the 22nd with the virus and double pneumonia.  I was actually on a call with my mum finding out about her hospitalisation on the 24th when she received a message from my aunt, who lives in the Netherlands.  Neither of us seemed to want to end the call so she could check it as we had a good idea of what it meant.  One of my cousins was there with Nell in the hospital at the end to ensure she didn't die alone.  Apparently she looked up, smiled at him, and closed her eyes.  My aunt assured us that her passing was as peaceful as the doctors could make it.  Of course, this has put my cousin at risk of the virus, so there's that to worry about now.  Thing is, it didn't just end there.  My great-aunt lived with her brother.  It was just the two of them alone in the family farmhouse, meaning that his chances of catching it at some point aren't particularly great.  What's worse is that due to a straining social infrastructure, my aunt and her family are having to look after my grandmother, meaning they can't visit him to help him through the grieving period as it'd mean they couldn't help her.  There was a bittersweet resolution to this in the fact that one of Nell's friends has also started coming down with the virus, meaning that she can be there for my great uncle during this time.  Thankfully I have Adita with me and my brother was down at the time visiting my mum so nobody else was isolated from family.  But it's still been really hard on all of us.  Nell was the closest a person could come to being pure of heart.  She really couldn't say no to people and as a little kid that allowed me to get into all sorts of trouble.  One time when visiting family in the Netherlands my mum had dropped me off with her so she could do some shopping.  Later she came back to discover me in a muddy pit in a rather jovial Nell since Nell hadn't been able to refuse me buckets of water.  Thankfully my mum saw the humour in the situation and immediately stuck my then toddler self in the shower and it's one of the memories we still have.  She also loved baking, especially waffles.  I don't mean a dozen or so.  I mean, whenever she knew we were visiting, she'd make several batches and send us home with a literal bucketload.  So many we'd actually have to freeze them just to have them over a longer period of time.  It was a really big thing for my mum, who of course lived in the UK with none of her family outside of me and my brother.  It was just that little taste of home cooking we all enjoyed.  And I'm glad that the year before her passing, just shy of a week in fact, all of us, including Adita, travelled to the Netherlands and were able to see her.  Now there's more.  that's happened since I sat down and initially wrote this, and it's not good news.  None of it is good news.  But it's stuff we as a family are not quite ready to come out about at this time.  I've shared with you what my family in general has agreed to share publicly on the matter, so please, no questions on the matter.  I know I share a lot of stuff I've been through personally, but please respect privacy of my family in this regard at this point.  Thing is, as hard as this is to say, this isn't the only thing that hit me hard that day.  That morning I had a session scheduled with my therapist, the one who's been helping me tackle my PTSD.  And as some of you know, I've been working on a video relating to autism, which has been an experience.  Autism is something that many of the people I know have told me I should get tested for, but I never have.  I always focused on it as, well, it was one person pointing out one thing, that doesn't mean anything.  But when I found myself 7 for 7 for the Common Traits of Autism on the Autism Self Advocacy Network's page, I started to consider things a little more seriously.  I talked to Maddy from The Last Nerve, formerly Objectively Subjective or The Goddess Eye Womb.  They sent me a couple of clinical tests and I scored within the range for potential autism.  So I decided I might as well schedule a session with my therapist, asking if they had knowledge of the subject, and we could use the session to discuss it.  They said yes to both.  I was expecting to go in, discuss the veracity of the tests I'd done, discuss some of the symptoms, and reach a plan as to how to advance from there.  That did not happen.  Instead, my therapist spent the first half of the session lecturing me on a lot of stuff I already knew and didn't see the relevance of to argue why they wouldn't do that.  They said a lot of stuff I still need to talk to them about, because honestly, I wish they'd just told me up front that they'd rather concentrate on my PTSD when I booked the appointment.  I felt like I'd been baited and switched, and that left me feeling worse coming out than going in.  After talking to both Maddie and Levi about the whole thing, began to write up my thoughts to discuss them with my therapist.  But then the news from the Netherlands reached us here and that just took over everything at that point.  It denied me the immediate ability to try and respond and resolve things.  I feel very much lost at sea in this regard.  On one hand, I felt like my questions had been completely ignored.  On the other hand, I didn't want to push the matter, as I feel like that'd be me trying to secure a diagnosis when that's not what I was after.  I'd have been fine if we'd just gone through things and they'd concluded I'm not autistic.  but what they'd instead just left me very confused about my whole position.  Here I am writing a detailed article on autism, it turns out I might be autistic, and that has an impact on how I write and interact with others.  I mean, I made a post on the 2nd of April since it was Autism Speaks' main fundraising day, just listing many of the issues I'd come across.  It was not meant as a comprehensive guide, but rather a heads-up for my viewers.  It had sucked for them to donate to Autism Speaks, only for me to come out and tell them that it was a mistake thereafter.  Well, turns out the autism community likes the post.  A lot.  And they ran with it, sharing it more than 7,000 times and giving it 10,000 likes, which is great!  I'm really proud and honoured that you like my post and it fills me with a lot of hope for the video.  But here's the thing, with that came the debates, the discourse, and I'm just sitting there having my feed blow up with everything including people asking questions of me, questions that I don't know if I really have the right to weigh in on.  As I told Levi in one of our calls to keep each other company and later work on the script, I felt like Schrodinger's autist.  I'm both autistic and not until I can find a therapist willing to discuss the topic, which is a rather lighthearted way of describing just how adrift I really feel.  So you can hopefully imagine how starting with that in the morning and then losing a loved one in the evening could just overwhelm someone.  I will be trying to resolve things with my therapist on that, but right now I wake up feeling physically drained.  like the blood is pouring from my arms and legs.  It's possible that there was a degree of miscommunication, and had I more time to think about what had been said before the news of our loss had made it here, I'd have noticed something and seen things in a different light.  But whether that was the case or not, that doesn't change how everything just came together in the situation and how it's impacting me in the now.  So yeah, that's why everything shut down for a little while.  I just needed to get some of that off my chest, as well as update those of you who don't follow the channel on social media.  Part of me tries to face things with humour, specifically the fact that every time I tell myself I can take a rest, that things are done, life just throws the next thing at me.  But honestly, it's just pretty difficult right now.  The video on autism is recorded now and it is coming out, but I don't even know if I'm going to have it done in time for Autism Acceptance Month.  I mean, I planned to have this thing done and out for the beginning of the month and it just\u2026 everything just totally knocked me\u2026 it just\u2026 yeah.  I'm not in a particularly great place right now, is what I'm saying.  I don't feel like I'm achieving anything and that's just frustrating me and making me go harder on myself and it's just this vicious cycle going round and round.  But, um, yeah.  I am working on things and I just wanted to give you that update and let you know where I am both physically and emotionally.  So I guess I'll see you around. ",
