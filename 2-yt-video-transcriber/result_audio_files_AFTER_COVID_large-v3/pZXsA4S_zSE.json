I have yet to encounter any apologists that can actually distinguish God from just the fabric of reality.  If you think about it, if God is really just this anthropomorphized reality, then that would explain why God doesn't really seem to give a shit if Jenny finds her keys or kids starve in Africa.  Until you can distinguish your god from the fabric of reality, then there's really no reason to think that god is necessary for reality to exist.  You're also ad hoc assigning personal properties to this ambiguous god figure.  There is no reason to say that this God is personal, powerful, or intelligent.  Just because you've moved God's goalpost to be outside reality does not mean that God needs to exist.

That doesn't mean that another universe can't arise with different properties.  A couple things that they don't think about is how changing these constants would also change other values that we think are constant, as well as changing our understanding of that particular universe.  But this also leads to another ad hoc assumption.  That would be the idea that our scientific laws are prescriptive to nature.  They aren't.  They merely describe the universe as we experience it.

Now the question is, where does that information come from?  Can't be explained by evolution, can't be explained by chemicals or time.

We've been able to genetically describe life on this planet as well as how this information could have self-assembled and changed over millions and millions of years.  So his entire argument here relies on a fundamental misunderstanding of evolutionary biology.  Slow changes over millions and millions of years perfectly explains the diversity of life that we have on this planet now.  He's just ad hoc assuming that evolution can't explain it.  Also, comparing DNA to a stop sign is really disingenuous because DNA is obviously not like a stop sign.  Stop signs are manufactured by people and are actually designed.

Moreover, I don't think that you can prove that any particular moral value is in fact absolute.  I mean, even within Christianity, y'all don't have absolute moral values.  Christianity's values have changed since its inception.  At one point, it was okay for Christians to own and sell people as property.  But of course, after 1865, that shit changed, didn't it?

These have all been thoroughly refuted multiple times.  Sean is even flat out wrong on a number of these arguments.  Like, the whole idea that evolution can't explain how DNA has changed over time.  He ad hoc assumes a lot of things, like the whole idea that another universe can't exist with different constants.  He simply can't know that.  He only knows that our universe wouldn't exist.  In this video, he goes as far as to ignore issues within his own religion in order to make his arguments.  Like the moral argument.  He doesn't seem to see a problem with reinterpreting the moral values of Christianity.  If they were immutable and unchanging, then Christians today would still be fighting to own other people as property, disallowing women's rights.  and murdering innocent people in the streets just for being attracted to somebody with the same genital configuration.
