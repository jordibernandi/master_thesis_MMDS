            "text": "God is sovereign, God is ultimate, God is over all things, that even when life looks like a disaster, he's in charge, which is a beautiful thing, all right?  Because here's the thing, you want God in charge versus you being in charge.  You guys are a disaster, all right?  I don't want you in charge of anything.  You're narcissistic, selfish, self-involved, every decision you make is for you.  See, this is, I started my church, 50 people, and everyone's like, everyone's like, you can't start a church like that.  We're in Canada, all right?  Your whole church has to be on the premise of, you have ideas, I have ideas.  We all have ideas, and they're all fine.  Sorry, that's how you should preach as a Canadian, all right?  Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.  And I'm like, that's awful.  So I got up and started telling people what I just said.  You're a wreck, I looked at you.  You are not the hero of your own life.  I don't care what Tony Robbins tells you.  You are not the hero of your own life.  Do not go deep inside yourself and try to find yourself.  You will destroy yourself.  Jesus says, deny yourself.  Don't find yourself, deny yourself, pick up your cross, follow me because you are not the hero of your own life.  Jesus is the hero of your life.  Jesus came, lived a perfect life in your place because you can't.  He died on a cross, paid the penalty for your sin for you instead of you and because of you.  took the wrath of God on himself, rose again.  That should be an offense to all of us because you can't do what God has asked you to do.  That's religion.  I'm trying to be a right person.  I'm trying to do this.  I'm trying to go to church this many times.  I go to this priest.  I do this many good things.  I go on these pilgrimages.  I say these prayers.  That's religion.  And all it's going to do is crush you.  Jesus shows up and he goes, let's shut that down.  There's nothing you can do that's gonna make you go to heaven.  So I had to come and do this for you.  The reality is, over and over and over again, we misunderstand the will of God because we think it's supposed to be for our success.  We think it's supposed to be for our victory.  That's man-centered theology.  Jesus isn't talking about your victory.  He's talking about your obedience.  He wants you to be obedient.  And he's not gonna tell you, by the way, everything that you wanna know before you do it.  That's a generational thing called entitlement.  We think because we're so entitled as a generation, we think God, the way the will of God works, is that if I can just, like all these decisions to make, and I'm sure God will just show me what to do before I do it.  That's how many of us function, right?  And so we try to, we're like, okay, I got this.  I don't know if I should marry Sarah, if I should marry Margaret.  I don't know which one.  Lord, please tell me.  And we think he's gonna go, Margaret.  All right.  We were waiting and we're like, okay, he's going to say it.  I know.  I'm going to look at my cereal.  He's going to give me a sign.  Give me a sign, Lord.  Give me a sign.  And I'm eating my cereal.  Oh, I see an M there.  I see an M. I think that means Margaret.  And the problem is that is not how the will of God actually functions.  See, listen, that comes from A culture, the reason we, one sociologist calls it the paralysis of choice.  He says, it's a generational thing.  See, back two generations ago, you would marry one of the 12 girls in your town that weren't your sister.  Those were your options, all right?  You were like, that's who you would marry.  Now you're on the internet, you're on Tinder, you don't know what to do.  You're like, I don't know how to make a choice.  I need God to show up and give me signs in the stars.  Some of you are trying to decide which city to move to, to go to school.  And you're like, I don't know if I should go to Pittsburgh.  I don't know if I should move to Seattle.  I don't know if I should move to Vancouver.  I don't know where I need to go to school.  Lord, show me, show me, show me, right?  And you're hoping you're looking for signs, right?  As if this is some kind of magic mind where God is some kind of crystal ball that we can just rub and go, okay, show me, show me, show me.  And some guy walks into work and you're just hoping, he's like, hello, my name's Pittsburgh.  You're like, that's it, I'm moving to Pittsburgh.  That's a sign.  We're Christians, we're not magicians.  That is not how God works.  That comes from entitlement.  So this is why we think of the will of God like this.  We think God, you think God owes you to tell you who you're gonna marry, to tell you her name, and he won't.  I'll tell you what he'll do.  He'll say, whoever you marry, you better serve her like Christ served the church.  That's what the Bible says.  It will not tell you a name.  And it won't tell you a city.  It'll tell you do something.  And when you do it, there's a way of doing it.  There's a character that you have to have.  Love and respect and serve.  That's what Jesus calls you to.  That's the will of God for your life.  You know what the will of God for your life is, Romans 8 says?  To be conformed to the image of his son.  You know who you follow?  A guy who was crucified.  So you wanna know the will of God for your life.  It's not just happiness.  It's not your victory.  It's obedience in the midst of whatever circumstances you're in. ",
