I don't think that's right.  Okay.  No.  No.  Okay.  10,420.  That's the right view on the ground.  Okay.  I believe it, top of the Aspen zone.  10,250.  In the hunt.  We're off to get the treasure.  The wonderful Forrest Fenn's treasure.  In an undisclosed region.  in the Rockies at approximately 8,500 feet.  Uh-oh, Graham.  So we're at the site.  our clues have taken us to.  It was not easy, but what we were hoping was here is not here.  We were hoping for a waterfall split in two and that we were going to find that box sitting right there in the middle.  There's a hell of a time getting there, trust me.  You can do it, baby.  Worst thing that happens is you swim.  Eight feet.  You gotta go high.  Yep.  What's in the hole?  I think you're going to have to swim back.  Do not try this at home.  Do not fulfill the prophecy.  Yep.  Alright, reel it back in.  There's one place over here we can look.  Fantastic.  This is super technical.  These rocks are insanely slippery.  And that's the best way I can put it.  Okay.  There's a cave up there.  Keep going a little further, Rex.  Ten more feet and then four feet above your head.  Right above your head.  There's a hole in there, yeah.  Well, that's how you do that.  The hunt continues.  Are we going to have to, like, get a rope to get you down?  What?  Are we going to have to get a rope to get you down?  No.  It's not up there.  Grandma's a stick.  Okay.  nice piece of quartz.  so this was the spot we were sent to and there was no waterfall.  we were hoping that this cliff was the blaze but we've checked everything All up in here.  Rachel went on top.  Rex went in there.  And so we're going to head down the river now.  If you're interested where we are, we're up in the high country on the Vallecitos River.  Yeah, I filmed it.  You think he could have just dropped in a deep spot?  No, it's above water.  Above water.  above the high water mark.  So let's bushwhack our way home. ",
