And that's where the solar panel is.  And this is what generates the power for the house and our water.  So here we are more or less.  We're not talking about green.  This is green energy right here.  You know?  No more fossil fuel for us.  So the borehole, I would have to use a generator until I buy the solar pump, which probably might not be necessary at this moment.  I could use a generator to pump the water up.  So here we run the wires for the solar panels.  Yeah, so we're going inside the house.  All of this will have to do with landscaping very soon.  So we're entering into the kitchen.  So this is the kitchen.  As I said prior, I touched this tile and it's about to be done.  I fit this kitchen myself.  Not because I didn't trust anyone to fit my kitchen, I've been doing this for years.  you know.  so with me and julia's idea we came up with this kitchen as you see it here.  so this is our solar panel this is our inverter the batteries here in this room.

You can push up the ceiling and it's all nice and all.  All for your children.  So what's this hanging down thingy right there?  Okay, the wall outside hasn't been done and the landscaping, but when it is done, there'll be lots of beautiful flowers outside my window.  So this is where the doorman is sleeping at the moment.  And people might ask, why do you have a doorman?  or why do you have someone to secure?  Because no one's in the property at the moment and so we need someone to obviously keep it clean and also just to take any deliveries and stuff while we're not here.  So that's the reason why.  Not only that, it corrects extra employment.  So what's your last message to Black Sea Family?  for anyone planning to build?  How much did it cost you? ",
