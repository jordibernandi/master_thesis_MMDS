            "text": "We got a major get woke, go broke.  update on Goodyear tires.  You may have seen the story.  A photo got released showing that Goodyear said some political slogans like Black Lives Matter are okay and others aren't, notably MAGA or Thin Blue Line.  After this controversy erupted, Donald Trump called for a boycott of Goodyear.  I don't know if he actually said boycott.  He may have, but many conservatives said it's time to play the same game the left plays and boycott these companies.  Well, Goodyear, fell into a well-placed trap.  I am impressed.  They issued a statement.  It was a very weak statement.  It didn't really walk away from anything.  It claimed like, oh, we didn't make that.  It doesn't mean that just because they didn't make it doesn't mean they weren't telling their employees what they could or couldn't do.  Now the best part.  leaked audio has come out proving them wrong, proving they lied.  And it's even worse.  In fact, the restrictions weren't just about Donald Trump or thin blue line or, you know, Blue Lives Matter or whatever.  It was quite literally along racial lines.  This might actually now be in the realm of illegality.  So the conservative boycott is likely going to continue.  And we'll talk about this.  And then I'll give you another quick update on get what go broke with the NBA and MLB just because there's similar stories.  But this is the main story.  So let's just read this one from WKBN First News.  They say audio from Goodyear training session reveals more about zero tolerance policy.  Trump tweeted Wednesday about the single image that was leaked, urging people not to buy Goodyear tires, citing their ban on MAGA hats.  They say, quote, Democrat, Republican, Trump, Biden, Sanders, whatever, that will no longer be allowed in the plant.  New audio from a training session at a Goodyear plant in Topeka sheds more light on a conversation with employees about the company's zero tolerance policy.  Now I'm gonna stop right there.  If they said no political slogans or whatever, I don't care who it is.  I'm fine with that.  They didn't, however.  They say a photo leaked from the meeting had a list of what was acceptable and unacceptable at the workplace.  But the new audio gives more context to that conversation.  WIBW obtained that recording.  The meeting references racial graffiti in the locker room.  Quote, some people may wish to express their views on social justice or inequity or equity issues such as Black Lives Matter or LGBTQ pride on their face coverings, shirts or wristbands.  That will be deemed approved because it applies with a zero tolerance stance.  The speaker on the recording said during the meeting, however, if any associate wears all blue White Lives Matter shirts or face coverings, that will not be appropriate.  Let's try and comply with these.  so you know everybody feels good in this factory.  I want to make sure, guys, make sure, guys, think about what we do in this factory.  In this factory, right?  We all work together to make tires.  That's what we do, the speaker said.  That's what we get paid to do.  So let's continue to do that and do the right thing and keep this place what it has always been, a good place to work.  Do the right thing.  Yes, you can talk about equity issues so long as it favors their ideology and it's the right thing.  But if you say all blue or white lives matter, now that would not be appropriate.  Now, I'll be fair.  I'm not a big fan, especially of... the, you know, the playing the game of what is acceptable and what isn't.  I don't know necessarily what the intent is behind All Blue or White Lives Matter.  The White Lives Matter stuff I've seen has been like white nationalists and white identitarians who have promoted it.  I'm not a big fan.  I think people are allowed to speak their mind.  The same as Black Lives Matter, if people peacefully protest, I'm all for the First Amendment.  But regardless of my opinion, there's a fly in front of me.  The issue is, in fact, they made it racial.  They straight up said, you can't say white lives matter.  You can't say black lives matter.  That is probably a violation of civil rights law.  Again, whether you agree or not isn't the issue.  It matters.  The law is.  So now Goodyear may actually be in a bit of trouble.  They say Trump tweeted Wednesday about the single image that was leaked, urging people not to buy Goodyear.  So I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't think he actually said boycott.  He didn't.  The Akron based company employs about 63000 people.  Goodyear released a statement following the president's tweet, saying in part the company has zero tolerance for any form of harassment or intimidation.  Now we know it's overt bias.  And yes.  racial bias.  They say that's why slogans or messaging that falls outside the scope of racial justice or equity issues is not allowed in the workplace.  I'm sorry, man.  If you're gonna start playing games about what race is acceptable in terms of sloganing, you are doing exactly what you say you're not allowed to do.  The president accused them of playing politics.  United Steelworkers Local 2 will host a rally against the president's call for a boycott.  Congressman Tim Ryan and Reps Tavia Galansky and Emily Sykes are expected to be there as well.  And of course, now the far left has started claiming that Donald Trump is calling for a boycott of American goods because their competitors aren't American.  Apparently, that's not true.  There's a ton of tire makers outside of Goodyear, and I'm sure there's many small businesses that could use a lift up.  If these companies want to play politics, well, then they're going to lose business.  You see, the only reason they allow this is because they know, like we've seen at Taco Bell, when they fire people who say Black Lives Matter, the press goes far and wide and the left will quit.  In a famous video, there's a guy wearing a Black Lives Matter mask.  The Taco Bell manager says, you can't wear it.  I'm sorry.  And he says, then I'm not coming in.  They said, then we're gonna let you go.  And he goes, fine.  He ends up getting fired or quits or something like that.  And that's the conviction of the left.  Because of this, the company backpedaled and said, okay, you can wear Black Lives Matter.  But what about any other slogan now?  You see how the game is played.  Conservatives are starting to stand up.  The left is gonna get mad about it because these companies are already starting to realize, guess who actually has money to spend?  Well, you know what?  This is a major get what.  go broke because now the president is coming out against them masterfully played.  Listen.  They put out the image.  Then they waited.  I don't know if it was on purpose, but I'll tell you what.  They put out the image and waited.  Goodyear then stepped right in it and said, actually, here's the thing.  And then they went, really?  Here's the audio.  Boom.  And that was masterfully done.  You drip out a little bit, make them set their own.  They set themselves up for failure, walk into the trap, and then you get them.  Get woke, go broke, Goodyear.  That's too bad.  But it's also a get woke, go broke.  NBA MLB update.  You see, These major sports, they want to wear the shirts.  They want to entertain a political ideology that supports the Democratic Party.  They'll claim it doesn't, but it does.  There are clear party dividing lines here because there are different perspectives on what it means and what it represents.  And I'll tell you what, right now, you've got 83 nights, maybe 84.  I don't know, whatever.  I think last night was the 84th night.  No idea.  80 whatever nights of rioting under the banner Black Lives Matter.  30 plus people dead.  So yeah, there's a big difference in political opinion around that shirt this gentleman is wearing.  Well, of course, ratings woes continue for woke NBA MLB.  Breitbart says both basketball and baseball hit screens this summer, filled with pay-ins to Black Lives Matter protests during the national anthem and an avalanche of sloganeering on sign stadium floors and fields.  And on player jersey backs, along with the intrusion of this political activism on TV during the games, the two leagues have literally blasted social media with one woke proclamation after another.  Four weeks ahead of the debut of the shortened 2020 seasons, NBA and MLB sports reporters brayed about how important the league's returns were and insisted that fans were hungry for sports.  But both leagues have struggled to limp past a few million viewers for any particular game.  And overall TV ratings have dipped below the pre-pandemic numbers, according to Sports Media Watch.  The NBA ratings have fallen and MLB is weak.  The NBA has struggled to average more than 1.5 million viewers and baseball is in no better shape.  For the NBA's opening week, the league averaged 1.56 million viewers down from the already lackluster pre-coronavirus average of 1.62.  Baseball has seen a smattering of numbers that hover in most cases well below 1.5 million average viewers.  The numbers for the NBA are particularly worrisome, given that many of the... I don't know, they're missing a word here.  Many of the games are low-performing games.  Many of the low-performing games are playoff seeding games that have taken place in primetime.  These are supposed to be the biggest games to date.  Games that will decide playoff matchups, though fans just aren't tuning in.  I wonder why... Amid the chaos and the calamity, many of us just want to get away.  But also many people are tuning in to pay attention to politics.  They want to know what's going on.  Politics has become pop culture.  It's kind of weird to see my ratings through the roof because people want to know what's going on in the world.  And I'll tell you this.  People don't want to watch woke sports, man.  I just want to watch the dudes play games, compare stats and see some good players, you know, accomplish some records and break some, you know, get some higher scores and just do better.  Sports is an escape.  I want to watch video games, sports, just whatever, to get away from the crazy sometimes.  There is no escape anymore.  Our whole lives right now are just inundated, slammed with politics left and right, and there's no escape.  So when you see nothing but Trump ads and Biden ads, and you've got your team, whether you're Team Joe or Team Trump, maybe you just need something where you can turn it on and kick back.  So you I've been playing the demo for quite a while.  The new game's out on PlayStation.  Man, it is great to just sit back and play a game where I got a little skateboard dude doing kickflips and doing whirlybirds and whatnot.  Whirlybirds aren't a real trick.  I'm kidding, by the way.  Skateboarders probably cringed and then laughed when they realized I wasn't serious.  But there's also the new Tony Hawk game.  And I bring this up because these games are not woke.  In Skater XL video game, I can just have my dude launch off the big, you know, the big air ramp doing nice, you know, mute grab.  I'm saying that specifically for a reason.  And then just it's outside of the realm of politics.  But what do you get with all this stuff is insanity.  I don't care about any of this.  I don't want to watch.  I would love to go to a bar.  I kid you not.  Sit outside with some outside TVs and have the game on.  I've never been a big sports guy.  I've never been a big basketball, baseball guy.  Baseball, I'm more of a fan of baseball than basketball.  because I like them.  It's sort of, you know, strategic and methodical.  You see the guy get up, you wait, there's a pitch you can watch.  And so there's break periods where you can eat, whereas NBA is like very hard action, right?  I'd love to go to a bar, sit down, order some wings and just have the game playing, talk with my friends.  I'm not going to do that right now.  It's not going to happen.  I'm not interested.  I am unenthused by what they're doing.  Now I'm going to sit home.  I'm going to order takeout and I'm going to play my skateboarding video game as an escape.  Now, as it pertains to tires, you know what?  I won't buy tires if they're going to play these games because it's only fair that if I'm going to say we got to stand up against this insanity, that I do the same.  And a lot of people are going to do the same as well.  Same is true for sports.  I'm not going to watch it.  I'll leave it there.  I got a couple more segments coming up in a few minutes.  Stick around and I will see you all shortly. ",
