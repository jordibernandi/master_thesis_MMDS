            "text": "Hi guys, this is just a short announcement to let you know that this will be my last upload to YouTube.  YouTube now routinely demonetizes my work and summarily denies my appeals.  That in and of itself isn't the reason for my leaving.  The pocket chains I've earned here on YouTube was never what motivated me to create content in the first place.  The whole purpose of my work has always been to reach as many men as possible with the indisputable message that they've been lied to about who they are and what they're worth for their entire lives.  Men deserve better than what they get, and the only way they're going to get that is by giving it to themselves.  That requires a lot of thinking and a colossal change in the attitude that men have been trained to have.  The problem is, I've been doing this here for almost four years.  That's how long it took me to reach 100,000 subs, which I thank you all for immensely.  For the past several months, however, YouTube has been draining my account of subscribers.  Recently, they've been unsubbing about 600 to 700 of you per month.  I've been hearing from you regularly in the comments that you're not getting notifications and have found yourselves unsubbed when you knew for sure that you'd not done that.  Time to say enough and pull the plug on this bullshit.  And while I'm at it, let me explain something else.  A lot of you guys have been in the comments saying how much you miss my monologues.  Truth tell, I miss doing them.  But producing content that I must push against YouTube's blatant social justice agenda has been tiring and demotivating.  I don't want to do it anymore, so I'm not.  I've come up with a better alternative for those interested.  I am restructuring my operations entirely.  If you want to continue to get the content I produce including future monologues, you have three options available.  One, you can find links below to both my Patreon and Subscribestar accounts.  For as little as a buck a month, and of course more if you want to be generous, you can get my content and you will be assured of email notifications every time.  Also, if you're broke, as many men are after life events lead them to red pills, or if you're just a cheap bastard, you can find my content at A Voice for Men on BitChute.  You'll find a link to that below.  I realize that this move will cost me a great deal of traffic.  I no longer care.  I don't want to be part of a platform that will not allow me to speak truth to power.  For those of you who enjoy the weekly Regarding Men discussions, you can also find them all at regardingmen.com, where you can sign up for notifications and our newsletters.  or you can sub at Tom Golden's Men Are Good channel here on YouTube and hope that the social justice warriors that work here allow you to get notifications and remain subscribed.  As for me, I'm done.  It's been a heck of a ride that I look forward to continuing on less restrictive platforms.  I'm leaving the channel here up so that newbies can continue to find my old talks.  So if it disappears for some reason, you know it wasn't me.  Thanks again for all your support, and I hope to see you next time. ",
