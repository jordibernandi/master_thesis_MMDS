            "text": "Hello everyone, Tina Spaulding, Trance Channel here.  I thought I would do another video for everybody because we're needing some inspiration these days.  I have a feeling I know who's coming through.  Let's see what they have to say to us today.  Here are the Arcturians, here we are, your dear friends, your dear extraterrestrial friends and we are, we will say excited about the process you are going through.  We know that many of you are deeply triggered at this time which means any unexamined fear that you have living in your mind is going to surface.  What we want you to understand, as we will say your guides and teachers in some form, is that you must address these now.  Your process of ascension is accelerating.  You do not see this process that you are involved in as a beneficial one, but we do.  We see innovation arising.  We see connection to nature arising.  We see self-realization beginning to dawn on some minds.  Some minds, in fact, are realizing just how crazy they are, just how fearful they are, just how unrestrained their ego is.  They are seeing it and they are feeling it and this is good.  This is good.  For those of you that have been on a spiritual path for longer, you have encountered many of these shadow aspects of yourselves.  What are shadow aspects?  They are aspects of yourself that you have denied, that you have repressed, that you have controlled and and that you have put away beneath your television watching habit or your drinking habit or your sexual promiscuity habit.  They are the negative feelings that keep arising that are being generated from beliefs that you have that are unloving.  So when you see these negative behaviors coming up in yourself, whether it be frustration or fear or paranoia, making others guilty when you think that they are not behaving the way they should, this is a big one that's coming up, projection of guilt.  This is a very, very big problem in humanity.  When you project guilt onto others, You get a sense of aggrandizement, a sense of feeling more righteous, a sense of being better than others.  What others are doing really is none of your business.  This coronavirus quarantine is not what you think it is for.  Yes, there is a virus.  Yes, it is making some people sick and even ending some beings' lives.  but it is not what it is being portrayed as.  It is for some other purpose, but it is beneficial to your spiritual evolution, which means you are having to be with yourself, you are having to be with your families, you are having to be with the decisions that you have and have not made regarding your life and looking after yourselves.  This is a time, we will say, humanity is being weaned.  You are being weaned from the breast that no longer is going to feed you and that is the system of governance that has turned you into, we will say, childlike adults, waiting for others to make decisions, waiting for others to make you healthy, waiting for others to educate you, becoming very dependent, staying dependent like children who will not leave the nest and grow up.  So what you're being given the opportunity to do right now is to grow up, which means to make sounder decisions.  Look at what you spend your money on.  Have you been spending your money on things that support your family and nurture your family and give you the opportunity to provide safe and secure housing, food, these kinds of things?  If you are underpowered, if you are feeling weak, then this situation is going to ask more of you.  It is going to ask you to step up a little bit.  It is asking you to use your ingenuity a little bit instead of being passive.  There is a huge generation of you that have become passive, not knowing how to garden, not knowing how to do much of anything at all, except watch Netflix.  So we applaud the transformation that is going on on this planet.  There are many beings waking up to some certain realizations as well that this seems to be an overreaction in some people's minds.  Why is this suddenly transpiring?  Why are the global governments cooperating when they never seemingly can never cooperate?  and yet here you see them cooperating not only for your, we will say, quarantine status but your 5G status.  You think that there are nation states.  until you see a global event then you realize, oh no, all of these beings are talking to each other, all of these beings are agreeing with each other, all of these beings are cooperating with each other.  The wars on your planet are fictitious.  They are deadly for the victims of those wars, but they are manufactured to cultivate fear, to cultivate separation.  So at this time, look at your own mind and what it is offering up for your observation.  This is where you are all going to receive a great gift.  Look beneath the form.  Are you afraid of death?  Are you afraid of your neighbors?  Are you lonely?  Are you ill-prepared for a downturn in the economy?  Look at yourself and ask yourself, what could I do better?  Rather than pointing a finger and asking what could they do better, We ask you to reel in your judgments, your projections of guilt onto others.  Look into your own hearts and minds and assess your life situation.  Assess your emotional stability.  Assess the shadows that are coming up and ask yourself, is this driving me all the time unconsciously and I don't know it?  You can use this time to learn some things that you need to learn, how to plant seeds, how to plant a garden.  These are things that you should all be doing all the time.  If you are an urban dweller, then you are making certain decisions about your value system, what you value.  Assess your value system.  Is your plush penthouse now with no garden really such a good idea?  These are things that you need to ask yourselves.  Do not ask anyone to rescue you.  It is time for 3D to rise to 5D, which means independent, interdependent people who are loving, self-governing and well-educated in many different things.  Pick up that instrument that you've always wanted to play or Dust off that one that you've put in the cupboard 10 years ago.  Get those coloring pencils out.  Get that to loom out.  Get your knitting stuff out.  Fix the car up that needs to be fixed.  Do all of these things now and see it as a great benefit to humanity.  Not just to yourself, but to humanity.  When you cultivate strength, when you cultivate health, when you cultivate... point of view of power, not power over, but power arising from within, you benefit everybody.  Once again, we want to remind you not to make others guilty because of this.  See it as an opportunity for your development and your ascension process.  We are the Arcturians and we are here to inspire you.  We are here to rattle your cage a little bit.  We are here to let you know that you are not alone even though you may feel isolated today.  Many of us are cheering humanity on through this transformational process and all of the skills that you learn in the next few weeks are going to serve you well in the future.  The lessons you learn in the next few weeks are going to serve you well in the future.  Pay attention.  Come from love.  Give love.  And know that all is well.  We will speak to you again at another time.  Just want to remind you that we do have a community called Channeling Jesus Community.  It's on Mighty Networks.  It is a combination of YouTube and Facebook kind of combination.  It has my entire video archive there, over 700 videos, many of which you will never have seen on YouTube.  And you can check it out at channelingjesus.com.  slash channeling.  Thank you for joining me.  I'll see you again soon.  Bye-bye. ",
