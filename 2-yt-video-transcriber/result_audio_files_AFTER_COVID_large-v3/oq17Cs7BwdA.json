            "text": "Hello everybody, as you know my last video was a reply to Ben Shapiro and he kept repeating the same phrase.  Judeo-Christian values.  And I decided that this concept is worth taking a look at.  So I started up youtube to see what some of the online opinion havers think it means.  So that's what this video will be, a summary and possibly mockery of the ideas held by people who talk about judeo-christian values unironically.  The first video I would like to highlight is this video titled what is judeo-christian.  It also has two other titles, presumably to be found more easily.  Advice from me to you, youtube has said that you only need to write one title.  And you can put the alternative search terms in the description.  Your video is just as visible.  This video goes over the very basics.  Judeo-Christianity refers to the common traditions between Judaism and Christianity.  That is because the old testament from Christianity is Jewish scripture as well which creates common traditions and a shared history.  Islam is excluded from this despite being related in the same way.  More about that later.  That video mainly goes into the etymology, that means they mostly explain where the word came from, when it was used, by who and for what reason and so on.  The part we care about is the idea of promoting the united states as a judeo-christian nation which started in the 1940s.  This was as a movement to counter antisemitism by highlighting the similarities between the two religions.  This coincided with the rise of Zionism which says that Jewish people should live in Israel.  Christian Zionism was on the rise in the USA at the same time.  This was motivated by different reasons, among them many very devout Christians believed in a prophecy that the Christian end of the world, the rapture, could only happen if Jewish people returned to Israel.  There are better reasons to support Zionism, for example the holocaust.  The reason so many Jewish people died was because no country wanted to accept Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany because there was no Jewish state.  They were a minority where they lived.  So the establishment of a Jewish state which would always grant refuge to persecuted Jewish people makes a lot of sense.  Of course that sounds good in theory until someone designated that a piece of land now belongs to someone else and everyone who was there before has to leave now.  The Israel-Palestine conflict is really complicated and worth another video.  Essentially this jewish state is in large part dependent on foreign support, especially from the united states because all states around it don't like it.  So, the rise of the idea of Judeo-Christian values made Zionism a more common position in the United States which is why the US still sends money to Israel every year.  Among other things, the idea of Judeo-Christian values is very convenient for some people, especially intensely religious Jewish people who want to have some sort of career as conservative politicians.  Can you imagine a political opinion-haver, let's say Ben Shapiro, getting on a stage in the United States and telling the people that they need to follow his Jewish religious values?  No, of course not, the United States is a majority Christian country but on the other hand as a religious Jew he can't get on stage and promote Christian values because that would just seem fake to the audience.  So this concept of Judeo-Christian values is very convenient for him because it allows him to spread his religious values and keep intensely religious Christians on his side.  That is my theory on why Ben Shapiro uses that concept.  And I have to say I get that, obviously I oppose the idea of basing any policy on what you think some god wants but I understand it as an attempt to create a sort of unity of religious jews and christians against atheists, also ben gets enough antisemitic shit as is.  so I get his attempt at combining christianity and his religion.  That being covered I think it's time we have a look at what those values even are.  A possible example might be Zionism because of the shared history of the term Judeo-Christian values and Zionism.  But I've not found a single person saying that Zionism is a Judeo-Christian value.  So, let's have a look at something I actually found someone say.  This is from FOCL online.  It has a person called Richard Weickart in it. ",

            "text": "They go on to explain that that means that Christians and Jews oppose things like abortion and euthanasia which is a fancy word for assisted suicide.  I will avoid the topic of abortion for now and focus on the no assisted suicide bit because even though that might sound nice and compassionate it's actually a pretty bad position to hold.  Basically, assisted suicide means that people who have a deadly condition which they cannot recover from and make the decision that they don't want to die a slow pain for death from that condition but that they would prefer euthanasia should be given a medically assisted suicide.  The German high court recently decided that euthanasia must be made available to terminally ill patients because forcing them to die slowly is not constitutional.  That is because the German constitution says that human dignity is unimpeachable.  And I am in full support of euthanasia in cases like that.  Terminally ill patients who have the full capacity to make that kind of decision should have that option.  But apparently judeo-christian values means making people like that suffer by taking those options from them and waiting for a terminal illness to kill them slowly.  Or even worse, waiting for them to attempt suicide on their own.  Which is bad because every single non-medical suicide method is horrifying, painful and not 100% successful.  So to force people into that is just cruel.  And to briefly touch upon the abortion topic again, it is notable that what they call a pro-life position should more accurately be called a pro-state forced pregnancy position.  That means if you oppose abortion you are committed to giving the state the power to take over the body of whoever has a womb and force them to remain pregnant if they happen to get pregnant by some way.  So, judeo-christian value 1, state forced pregnancy and making terminally ill people suffer longer are good.  The next clip I found is from EU parliament, the man speaking is Nigel Farage, you may know him from that.  one time he led the United Kingdom straight off a cliff called Brexit.  He is mainly talking about that time.  a French newspaper called Charlie Hebdo was attacked by two gunmen for making fun of religion.  Farage uses that to segue into his political agenda.  He actually makes a good point, he says a reason that these gunmen were radicalized against European newspapers was because of the foreign policy of many of the European countries. ",

            "text": "Now, I don't really agree with the use of the word muslim community there.  that kind of suggests like all of those countries are some sort of unitary muslim village.  He later extends this idea of a muslim community to every immigrant and refugee who is not judeo-christian so that took a wrong turn somewhere.  He then says we must be more brave and courageous in standing up for Judeo-Christian culture.  The only thing he mentioned before he trailed off to pretending that 1.8 billion muslims somehow make up one homogenous community was that he didn't like the foreign policy European nations have been taking part in.  So Judeo-Christian values who don't invade the middle east.  And that's something I can agree with, provided that's what he meant.  His points weren't completely clear to be honest.  Speaking of not clear, Donald J. Trump, the president of the United States of America.  In this clip he says that they are defending Judeo-Christian values again and in the next breath he says that they are glad to be saying merry Christmas again.  Now, this is a pointless American conservative culture war.  Basically, recently to be more inclusive towards people who don't celebrate Christmas people started saying happy holidays instead of merry Christmas.  And for some reason I will never comprehend, literally everything is co-opted by politics in the United States.  so conservatives say merry Christmas and non-conservatives say happy holidays.  So I guess Christmas is a Judeo-Christian value, or at least saying merry Christmas is.  Can you see the problem?  Do you see how Christmas may not necessarily map onto the concept of Judeo-Christian values?  Yeah that's right, from a religious perspective Jewish people don't celebrate Christmas.  So to say merry Christmas would be exclusive to Jewish people while saying happy holidays would be inclusive.  Obviously there are plenty of non-Christians who celebrate Christmas for cultural reasons, like I do, but Christmas is and always will be a Christian holiday and to deliberately say Merry Christmas rather than the inclusive version means that this apparent Judeo-Christian value excludes Jewish people.  Judeo-Christian value number 3?  Wait what?  Jewish people?  Who cares about those?  Merry Christmas!  Our next clip is by Jordan B Peterson, you know, the man who started his career by spreading lies about Canadian hate crime legislation.  The video is titled Sam Harris is Judeo-Christian.  I am less concerned about Sam Harris even though Peterson's conclusion is very interesting, I am more interested in what comes before that.  Peterson arguing against moral relativism and for Judeo-Christian values.  Moral relativism just means that you don't believe in the idea of an absolute way to be good or right.  This is in contrast to what Peterson names as judeo-christian values.  He says that judeo-christian values are what gives you the information of what is good and right.  And that way is God.  do what God says and you will always be a good person.  And if you don't believe in God, say like me, then Peterson explains how he thinks you would act. ",

            "text": "He also explains how he believes moral relativism makes you interact with other people.  So, we can see that Peterson clearly has some strong opinions on moral relativism.  There are many things I could say to counter the things he said but I will leave that to other videos.  What I want to focus on is what judeo-christian values are.  And curiously it seems, at least to Peterson, judeo-christian values are the opposite of moral relativism.  He says judeo-christian values believe that everyone has a spark of divinity in them which makes them respect each other.  Also, if you respect other people you are Judeo-Christian.  Peterson said so.  That's how it works.  If you are capable of normal human relationships you are religious.  Judeo-Christian value 4.  Judeo-Christian values are when you respect people and believe in moral absolutism.  The next video is made by PragerU, in case you don't know Prager University is not a university but just a very conservative propaganda channel paid for by oil billionaires.  The video is titled why has the west been so successful.  It's mostly about making up reasons for why white people are better than others.  They explain that the reason the west, whatever that is, has been so successful was because of a combination of judeo-christian values and ancient greek reason.  From a historical perspective it's interesting that they seem to think that Europe is so rich because of some books and ignores the very complicated historical and geographical reasons why Europe was in a position to conquer the entire world and enslave and plunder the rest of the world.  It almost seems like they tried to ignore that.  But a Marxist analysis of human history would be a topic for another video.  Maybe comment if you want to see that.  Anyway, Ben Shapiro, who appears to be the host in this video, explains that Judeo-Christian values are the beliefs that a good god created an ordered universe and that this god demands moral behavior from his paramount creation, man.  This is pretty much the same thing.  Jordan Peterson said, there is a god and this god is how we know what's right and wrong.  And this is the point at which I'd like to ask you, what is it that god thinks is right and how do you know?  And this is the point at which I lie back and watch the show.  Because to say something like god decides what is moral and right you would first have to prove that god exists, that god really says that and why we should listen to god.  People have tried to do all of that.  but philosophers nowadays are very atheist for a reason.  There just aren't many ways you can even go about proving the existence of a god neither scientifically nor philosophically.  But let's say we assume the existence of a god.  How do we know what they have to say?  After all, the bible and Jewish holy scriptures were all written by humans and on top of that at least 2000 years ago.  So how do we even know if what this book says comes from god?  and even if it does, does god still hold the same position as 2000 years later?  I've changed roughly all of my opinions in the past 5 years, why would we expect an all powerful being not to ever change their mind?  All of these are questions for the few religious people who will defend Judeo-Christian values in the comments.  My point is that all holy scripture was ultimately written by people, not god.  Because god lacks the physical form to hold a pen.  So really when we say the word of god we just mean that some guy at least 2000 years ago wrote it down.  Judeo-Christian value 5.  Someone wrote down something and I believe that this must be the absolute truth because the cover says it was written by god even though that's clearly not possible.  The next video is titled Compassionate Capitalism A Today Christian Value.  That's the title of a book by this guy and that video is amazing.  He explains that capitalism is the system god wanted and that actually the bible is all about promoting capitalism.  He explains that capitalism was founded in Christianity, somehow.  And I can really only recommend you watch that one, link in the description.  I could make a whole reply video to this alone but this video is already getting delayed so I won't.  Judeo-Christian value 6, capitalism is totally supported in the bible, what are you talking about?  Jesus opposing wealth.  I cherry picked a different quote which means I am right.  This was the final clip about Judeo-Christian values I picked for today.  I would like to have a look at the question, why is Islam excluded here?  Like everything Judaism and Christianity have in common is shared by Islam to some extent, why isn't it Judeo-Christian Islamic values?  I asked myself that after watching a video titled why is Islam not Judeo-Christian?  the uploader points out that in many ways you can look at Christian and Jewish beliefs as extremes with Islam usually being in between.  For example, there are very strict rules about what religious Jews may eat.  and there are basically no restrictions on what Christians may eat and Islam is in between.  There are way less rules than in Judaism about what and how to eat but there are still some restrictions like most notably not eating pork.  This extends to many things but most importantly, at least from a Christian perspective, the view of Jesus.  As you know in Judaism they don't really care about Jesus.  Christians on the other hand say he is God and the son of God.  It's complicated.  And in Islam Jesus is seen as a prophet which is in between seeing him as a god and seeing him as unimportant.  As Sajid points out, Islam has more in common with Christianity and Judaism than they have in common with each other.  So, from a religious point of view the concept of judeo-christian values doesn't even make sense.  The idea of judeo-islam or islamo-christianity would make way more sense when looked at through a religious lens.  But I think that would be a mistake.  As the top comment under Sayid's video says, judeo-christian is not a religious term, it's a political one.  One designed to create a deliberate us vs them narrative with the religious Christians and Jews on one side and the atheists and other religions, mainly Islam, on the other side.  Perhaps in the past it was really intended as a way to unify Christianity and Judaism to reduce antisemitism among Christians.  but that's not how it's used nowadays.  It is used to say our values without saying which values.  And this is a telltale sign of a right wing dog whistle.  They say something everyone can somehow agree with.  Don't say what they mean.  That way everyone can interpret something different into it and that's how the right wing recruits.  Dennis Prager says Judeo-Christian values and anyone who is somewhat Christian can interpret anything they like in there.  State first pregnancy?  Sure.  Loving all human beings unconditionally?  Sure.  Being homophobic?  Sure.  Being racist?  Sure.  All of those can be seen as judeo-christian and that's what makes it so hard to pinpoint what judeo-christian values are.  Because the official answer is it's a belief in a god and the dog whistle says whatever people want to hear.  And I think that's all I had to say about that.  Thanks for watching, see ya.
