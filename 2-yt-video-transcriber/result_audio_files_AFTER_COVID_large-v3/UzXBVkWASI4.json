Two million, a hundred, two thousand, four hundred minutes.  How do you measure for years of this shit?  In scandals, impeachments, in porn stars, in Scaramoochies, in rallies, in insurrections, in flies, in 2,102,400 minutes, how do you measure for years of the lies?  How about... I'm a very stable genius.  Seasons of trauma.  2,102,000 falsehoods he tweeted.  Basically 14,976 times he didn't have a plan.  11,780 volts he said he needed.  How do you measure for years with this orange garbage can?  In Spicers, in Conways, in Sanders, in Macanese.  In fake news, Pete sweeps alternative facts in 1,460 days.  But who's counting?  Who could keep track of all the treacherous facts?  We're betrayed by pardons, and bootins, and bumpers, and diss, and presidents, and doctors, and Max's Hollywood face.  President racists, and tantrums, and chariots, and juniors.  President Trump?  Well, former President Trump.  Oh God, that makes me so horny.

Big Macs and phone calls and love notes to North Korea Impeachments, spray tans, and law corruptions Chaos, destruction, and Texas Giuliani's group.  Never, never again, Donald Trump.  Seasons of trouble Seasons of trouble. ",
