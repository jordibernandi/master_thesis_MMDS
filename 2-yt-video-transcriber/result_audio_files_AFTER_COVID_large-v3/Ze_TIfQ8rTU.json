            "text": "The footage is graphic.  One of the deputies, a 31-year-old mother who was shot in the face.  She courageously took action and placed a tourniquet on her partner while frantically trying to call for backup.  Her words were barely audible as she was shot directly in the jaw.  Listen to her call for help.  As all of this was unfolding, a group of people in Compton were watching from across the street, laughing and filming instead of calling 911 with one of the onlookers celebrating their suffering.  Watch this.  They just aired the police out.  They go up and come.  They just got aired out because who's sharing a shot in the face?  They tripping.  It's going up and coming.  Bust on the police.  Unbelievable.  The gunman still at large this morning.  The reward for his arrest now up to $200,000.  I want to welcome in someone who used to be a part of the LAPD family, retired Sergeant Cheryl Dorsey.  Cheryl, thank you for being with us.  I'm learning.  you joined the force in 1980, and during your career you worked exclusively in patrol with Specialized Unit.  I want to get your reaction to that in just a moment, but President Trump is speaking right now.  We're going to listen live.  Thank you.  We'll continue this conversation.  Cheryl, thanks for sticking by and staying with us.  Again, we're continuing to search for the suspect following the ambush that we saw on Saturday night.  I can't begin to imagine what goes through your mind when you see this video footage.  What's your response?  I'm sure your heart just breaks for these deputies.  Well, of course, listen, I don't celebrate the loss of a life or significant injury.  To anyone I don't condone violence by the police and I certainly don't condone violence against the police, I think that this is something that could be retaliatory.  Because of all that's been in the news recently with that particular station in Compton particularly.  But nationwide where police officers are not held accountable when they use excessive points against folks in the black and brown community.  People are frustrated and while this is not helpful, certainly protesting at the hospital where the officers were transported and were being treated is not helpful in the distraction from the root cause.  I don't celebrate this, and I'm very disappointed that others would do the same.  Yeah, you know, you mentioned those protesters outside the hospital, and I think we've got some sound from that.  I just want to play it just so everyone at home kind of has an understanding of what was going on when these officers were taken there to the hospital to fight for their lives.  This was happening outside the hospital.  I don't die, mother fucker!  Again, at least these people were saying that they hoped the officers would die from their injuries that they had sustained while sitting in that patrol car there.  And you kind of alluded to this relationship within the area, the Compton area of California here, between police and residents as well.  Does that kind of play into why we would even see people saying these horrible things?  Well, listen, they're knuckleheads on both sides of the equation, and so I can't speak to what motivates the people that we saw in both of those videos, but we do know for a fact, and it's been acknowledged by Sheriff Alex V. in a way, but that there are gains internally.  on the L.A.  County Sheriff's Department, specifically out of the Compton Station.  They call themselves the executioners, and they too celebrate the shooting and harming of black and brown folks down there in South Central Los Angeles.  And so while there's plenty of blame to go around, I get why folks may be voicing their glee, if you will, because now sheriffs are suffering much like they have been.  Yeah.  How do you go about repairing these relationships?  Right.  I mean, you want everyone in the communities to feel safe and respected.  Absolutely.  Listen, everybody should go home at the end of a police encounter on both sides.  We all have families.  They have families.  We certainly want to go home to ours.  And so we have to be honest about the problems that exist on police departments.  nationwide, 18,000 of them.  We have to address the problem.  If we don't admit that it exists, then we can't fix it.  And we know that they are in the minority, but there's certainly errant officers out there who abuse their authority.  And so unless and until a police chief or a sheriff is willing to admit that he has gangs, 17 of them on his department, then we're going to continue to have this kind of retaliatory response, I believe, based on what I'm seeing and hearing on social media.  Yeah, well, clearly there's no attempt at solving or finding a solution for police reform peacefully when you take it in that manner and that approach using that violence.  It just doesn't get anything done and no changes are made effectively, unfortunately.  But Cheryl Dorsey, we appreciate you weighing in and kind of setting the scene for us about what that situation is like out there.  We appreciate your time. ",
