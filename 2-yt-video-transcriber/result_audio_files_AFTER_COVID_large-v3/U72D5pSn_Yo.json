            "text": "Hi beautiful brothers and sisters, how's it going?  I think Instagram was glitching because I was doing the story and it just wasn't saving.  so I'm just going to do a live video.  I'm just taking little baby Archie Bear out for a walk and I just wanted to say happy Boxing Day to everyone.  and um i've got a bit of a download that i wanted to share and the download is is that things are going to start getting easier for us as a collective um in 2021. like things are going to happen things are going to go down arrests are going to take place and i'm getting really strong feelings about the quantum financial system about the gold back currency about jasara nasara.  It feels like things are really, really shifting with regards to that.  Sorry, guys.  I've got this one dog that fancies Archie.  He really is one for the ladies, Archie.  It must be his pheromones.  But anyway, the message that I'm getting... is that like the energy shifted?  and I know this is weird but I don't watch any mainstream news.  obviously I don't want to like put myself in the firing line for a shot.  do you know what I mean?  so I don't watch mainstream news but I do go on YouTube and uh just flashed up yesterday about um something to do with the the trade deal in Brexit and when I saw it I I thought something's shifting, something's moving because if they really, really wanted to deeply torment humanity or the people of the UK, they would just be dragging out this Brexit deal, this trade deal.  I honestly don't know anything about it.  But the fact that it's all like moving forward now and things are getting sorted out, that was a clear sign to me that the White Hats had something to do with it.  So I sort of tuned in and I was like, feel the energy that things are shifting, that the energy is shifting now, 2021.  And it feels like an analogy that I'm being shown is like a gardener.  So imagine you've got this really, really decrepit old house and you're about to do an upgrade.  And it's like you're at the bit in the garden where you've got to clear out all of the debris.  You've got to go in there.  There's like roots.  There's like toxic roots that have been there for eons.  You've got to go in there.  You've got to get your handle on all the roots and start pulling them out.  And it feels like 2020 has been a year that has been sort of connected to that, to sort of like strategically the white hats getting in place to literally pull out the weeds of the swamp.  So the message I'm getting is that it does take longer than what we hope, obviously, but that's because it's so old and ancient, this, this iconic system.  So it's not like, and the tentacles run in every single aspect of society and POTUS has got so much against him he can't like.  he's got like.  you know the whole media have done a big number on him so he can't go in there changing this that and the other without absolute uproar.  so everything has to be done unfortunately a little bit slowly but very very strategically.  so um the vision i'm getting is that 2020 was all about you know basically pulling out the roots pulling out the weeds And 2021 is about really, really clearing the space and planting those new seeds for new earth.  That's what I feel.  And I can't help but feel, come on Archie, I can't help but feel this has got something to do with Jasara and Nasara.  So going forward, I would say don't watch the media.  Really, really like try to keep a high vibration at the moment.  there's very very thin veil between the realms at the moment and you know like our joy is what is being targeted.  so if you can just stay clear of the mainstream media and just stay in your own alignment, your own joy, your own blessings, you know, going on rampages of gratitude, being artistic, being creative, just keeping your vibration high.  Like that is the best thing you can do brothers and sisters.  And that is the absolute opposite of what the dark cats want you to do.  So just wanted to share that message.  Also wanted to let everyone know that I'm absolutely loving working with my healing machine.  And so powerful, this Tesla technology.  And it's so amazing because I jumped on board just as it came to England.  It was like really, really getting popular in Australia.  My friend Lisa told me about it.  Jumped on the Healey train.  Just did one little video about it.  Sold seven of them.  You get \u00a3300 per Healey device.  I made my money back in 24 hours, guys.  Also, they sent me a brand new healing machine worth two grand.  So it's really, really worth it.  I mean, if you've got a community and you've got like people in your community with chronic pain and, you know, things that modern medicine hasn't, especially like fibromyalgia, things like that, where issues that mainstream medicine hasn't really been able to address, then the healing resonance is absolutely amazing.  so i just want to let everyone know that i highly recommend working with these technologies.  this is the first time i've ever got behind a product and um i'm absolutely loving it guys it's really really amazing it's really helping me.  i'm loving working with the bushflower remedies And I mean, I don't really, sometimes it's hard to tell the difference because I've got a very high vibration, but it's definitely helped me with my back pain.  But the thing is, though, when you've got, you know, like with anything, you can't just... Oh, look at Archie.  He's got a new mate, guys.  She fancies him.  All the girl dogs fancy Archie.  And I'm not being biased, it is an absolute fact.  Because all their owners say, oh, she's never normally like that.  Oh, I've never seen her be like that with another dog.  And I'm like, it's the Archie effect, guys.  um anyway so yeah i just wanted to say that it is.  i haven't really got behind any products before.  i haven't really felt inspired to but i'm really really excited about this.  and uh i think anyone that's watching this if you've got a community like if you've got a spiritual community or you run groups or anything like that i've jumped on the heli train you make money back within like 24 hours.  i did so.  um yeah it's cool.  hi rainbow warrior from portugal hi guys.  So yeah, a little Instagram live, just in the park in Brighton.  And taking Archie for a little walk.  My Christmas was, it was actually all right.  I was meant to go to Glastonbury to be with my family.  But what with all the COVID losses, that got cancelled.  So it was just me and Finn.  But actually it was really nice.  It was just really chill.  We've never had a Christmas with me and Finn.  Those of you, I loved it.  Um, it's about it.  I'm loving being in Brighton.  It's absolutely amazing.  Don't miss Glastonbury at all.  I did 20 years there.  That's plenty.  Um, and yeah, let's see what happens now with this whole, like, Tier 4 malarkey.  I mean, this is all nonsense.  It's all absolute nonsense, guys.  But anyway, this is the video I wanted to make, and I'm going to take Archie home now, but... God, my hat hasn't blown away, which it has done three times already.  Not when I've been live though.  But yeah, I just wanted to send you all many, many blessings.  Really, really look forward to expanding this community next year and watching my cards.  Men don't like that, some men don't like that, but that's what we women are saying.  We're saying, where are all the awakened men?  What do you mean?  Got a bit of backlash on FB about that one.  Step up now, brothers.  Step up.  Lead the way.  Protect us.  Anyway, guys, love you all.  Share this video if you can.  Blessings.  How do you turn it off?  I don't even know how to turn it off.  Oh, gosh. ",
