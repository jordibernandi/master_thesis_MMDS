            "text": "I want to pose a question to you.  And this is a question that's going to be in the minds of many something so crazy that most people will immediately dismiss what I'm about to say.  And for the 99% of people out there who think this is a lunatic thing to imply or even an incredibly offensive thing to even suggest, well, I don't know if I can help you.  But for the 1% that's out there that may have an open mind and may be willing to have an intellectually honest discussion about contemporary theological issues, maybe I can help you.  And here's the statement that I want to make.  Modern so-called Christianity is nothing more than a new version, a new form, if you will, of the occult.  And yes, I know what I just said.  Hey guys, your friend Spencer here.  I want to read to you a verse here in Revelation chapter 2 about the church of Thyatira.  Now, this was, of course, one of the letters to the seven churches in the book of Revelation.  But there's something interesting about this church that I want to note and bring out to you.  It says in verse number 20 of Revelation chapter 2, it says, \"...notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a  prophetess.\"  to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, to eat things sacrificed unto idols.  So you see that God's order in the New Testament church was disrupted and they were being seduced to commit fornication and to eat things sacrificed to idols.  That sounds like paganism to me.  It sounds like paganism had infiltrated this church.  And the thing is about history is that history is always repeating itself.  And I think in many churches today, this same spirit of Jezebel has seduced these people and has caused them to commit fornication and eat things offered unto idols.  and just a terrible thing.  But this is what it says there in verse number 24.  And he makes a statement there, those who do not know the depths of Satan, talking about people in Thyatira.  Here's the thing today, and I think this is maybe the problem in Thyatira, and I think it's the problem that we have today, is that they didn't really get the whole picture.  They got one side of the picture when it comes to theology.  Can I tell you that in the realm of theology today, everybody loves to focus on the positive, especially the positive things of God.  And there's a lot there, no doubt.  There's plenty to talk about about what's right about the Lord.  And these people are talking about the grace of God, the love of God, the mercy of God.  Hallelujah, praise the Lord.  Yeah, absolutely.  god is merciful god is loving god is gracious and i thank god for that.  i love that about the lord.  he is good he says those which know not the depths of satan.  satan's willing to take this very far.  He's willing to do some sadistic things to ruin the souls of men.  I want to give you an illustration real fast.  And this is something that you need to get if you're going to really understand Satan.  You know, if you look at our third Adam documentary, we explored the topic of Satan's desire to imitate God.  That was his desire in heaven.  I mean, that really has been his agenda.  He wants to usurp God and get worship like God.  That's what he wants.  So he's always trying to imitate the things of God.  Now, I want to use an illustration of the Wizard of Oz, if I can for a moment.  That seems to be one that everybody's at least basically familiar with.  When Dorothy came down in that house, her house landed on a Wicked Witch of the East.  And her sister, the Wicked Witch of the West, was not very happy.  Now, everybody knows the story of the Wicked Witch of the West.  She has green skin, wrote a broom, and she had all those flying monkeys and the black outfit.  And everybody's familiar with her.  And I think generally when people think of the occult, they think of the Wicked Witch of the West.  They think of crazy, far-out people.  But did you forget that there was another witch in that movie, too?  Not only was there a wicked witch, there was a good witch.  The Good Witch of the North.  And the Wicked Witch of the West would be what I would consider black magic.  People that are into dark arts.  But the Good Witch of the North was into something that I would consider to be good magic.  White magic, if you will.  That's the term they use.  White magic.  And... Let's just take that analogy that I have right there and let's apply it to modern day context.  Who would be the black magic petitioners here in these day and age?  Well, I can think of a couple.  I can think of guys like Aleister Crowley.  That guy was a sadistic freak.  Don't ever look at that guy.  That's a horrible, horrible man.  I can think of guys like Anton LaVey, Marilyn Manson.  Matter of fact, the one that's alive today that seems to be pretty prominent that nobody really seems to catch is Maryam Abramovich.  She was real heavily involved with the Hillary Clinton campaign, campaign manager, and all that spirit cooking stuff and all that stuff.  You better be real careful about that stuff.  And if you look her up, Mary Abramovich, you'll see that her biggest disciple that she made that's alive right now is a young lady named Lady Gaga.  And all that pop music and stuff, that's not music.  That's practicing magic.  That's what all that is.  You're not watching a concert.  You're watching a ritual.  And you say, that's crazy.  Well, maybe then you're like the Church of Thyatira and you have not known the depths of Satan.  Maybe you just think, oh, it's just cutesy little energy.  It's just cutesy little music.  Ah, it's harmless.  I fear that you have not known the depths of Satan.  And so if those are the black magic people of today, but who are these white magic practitioners?  Could it be, and here's a question I want to throw at you, okay?  Could it be that... The majority of people today that are practicing white magic, that these occult white magic practitioners are meeting every week in these covens, and they're practicing incantations, spells, and enchantments on each other, and they're not calling it a coven.  They're calling it a church.  Could that be such a crazy thing to consider?  Could that be so far out there that, I mean, Spencer, you've gone so far off the ranch even suggesting that it's shameful.  Could it really be that crazy to say that?  I mean, I don't know everything, but could that be that crazy?  I don't think it is.  I don't think it is.  You know, I had a interesting conversation recently with somebody who God had saved out of the occult.  And they made this statement to me, and this has haunted me ever since then.  And they said this, they said, most people, when they get into the occult, they don't even know what they're getting into until it's too late.  And, you know, the thing is today, most people have, most people, especially you that are watching this video, mostly you've got the devil all wrong.  I mean, you think he's some sort of lewd, crude guy walking around in a red outfit with horns and a pitchfork and throwing dirty heroin needles at kindergartners and saying, hey, shoot up, kids, it's great.  And that's not Satan.  That is not what Satan is.  That's not what he does.  That is not his game.  He never plays that game.  Satan is wearing a much nicer face than that.  And he's not a dark creature.  He's a very bright creature.  And I know that not because I've read a bunch of Masonic Lodge literature.  I know that because I've read the Bible.  And in 2 Corinthians 11, verse 13, it says this, \"...for such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.  And no marvel for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of  light.\".  Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness, whose end shall be according to their works.  You know, Satan is not some evil power.  He's a real living entity.  And he has an intellect, emotion, and a will.  And his intellect has taught him That if I'm going to cause damage, I need to start presenting myself not as some dark, crazy, sadistic creature.  I need to do a lot better PR campaign than that.  I need to become an angel of light.  And so those who are serving me and those who are doing my bidding... think that they're doing a good thing.  And it seems like the most dangerous form of this occult is modern Christianity.  You know, when I first heard the warnings about these modern churches, these modernistic churches, these end-days charismatic New Apostolic Reformation churches, I I just initially thought, well, maybe they're just a little bit more progressive and maybe they're just a little bit more different than me.  And I just kind of dismissed it.  Maybe they just have a different style of music and maybe they just live out in California and they have just maybe just a different culture out there, maybe a little bit more loose and something maybe I'm not used to or comfortable with or maybe something like that.  And I just kind of chalked it up to personality differences or cultural differences or just a few little preferential things.  But I started looking into it.  And I realized it has nothing to do with music.  Almost nothing.  This is a deception that is so fantastically crafted, that is so complex, that is so deceitful, that is astounding.  This is something that literally every time I see it, it just blows my mind.  How could it be so good?  The whole thing is wrapped in a sugar candy coating so sweet that it's tempting.  And I deal with a lot of guys, my generation of guys, who are always getting into this stuff, kind of going this direction.  And as they do that, as they go that road, they're always pointing to the faults of, or maybe even the bad experiences that they had with men who held a fundamental position in Christianity.  And trust me, there's plenty there.  I mean, anytime you're dealing with people, you're dealing with flawed creatures.  And so, yes, there's going to be fault.  There's going to be crazy there.  There's going to be men who, although they had the right position, they may have the wrong disposition.  And yes, they don't always get it right.  I don't always get it right.  But the position is right.  It's not about these men.  It's about the truth.  You can blame whoever for whatever.  But I fear that there's a generation of people that are going that route, getting into all this contemporary music, getting into Casting Crowns, Hillsong Bethel, getting into all of this stuff, and they don't even understand or know the depths of Satan.  God has shown me some things that I cannot unsee.  I have learned things that I cannot unlearn.  Africa has taught me things.  The Spirit of God has taught me things.  This Bible has shown me some things and we're going to put those out there for you.  So if you have not subscribed to this channel, I want you to do so now.  We're going to take you on a ride and show you the truth about how deep this rabbit hole goes.  And your mind is going to be completely blown with what you see.  These darling people that you see with the smiling faces and the crystalline voices, we're going to show you that they're not what you think they are.  We're going to show you that the whole thing's a farce.  And we're going to show you the truth.  But I warn you, I warn you, you won't be the same.  You won't be able to enjoy that stuff anymore.  You won't be able to look at Hillsong the same anymore.  God bless you, friend.  May God speak to your heart as we come to the end of this age and the Lord Jesus Christ comes back.  God bless you. ",
