            "text": "The Biden campaign is imploding as early voting in key swing states fails miserably.

We are starting to get the data in on early voting.  to put it mildly, it is absolutely panicking the Democrats.  Now, if you don't know, Joe Biden's strategy for this election was to tap into the ambiguous mail-in voting that would be at record numbers this year because of concerns over the pandemic.  The Democrats would outperform the Republicans overwhelmingly in the early voting.  The Republicans would come back on election day on November 3rd for in-person voting, but then the Democrats would just make up the difference and then some with late vote counting, okay?  So that was Biden's strategy.  And in order for it to work, Biden has to have a massive lead over Trump in the key swing states going into November 3rd.  If he doesn't, all bets are off.  I mean, the strategy basically implodes.  The strategy is based on the narrative that Biden is trouncing Trump in the early voting and particularly in the swing states.  And so the data is coming in on early voting.  And guess what we're seeing?  We're seeing nothing less than a total collapse in that electoral strategy, a total collapse.  Nowhere are we seeing this collapse more evident than in the key swing state of Michigan.  Right now as we stand, Joe Biden is losing Michigan.  Trump is up over Biden in Michigan 40% to 38%.  And that's assuming that the Democrat ballots are all voting Biden.  And that's a big assumption.  It's not so much on the part of the Republicans because Trump got 94% of the Republican vote in the primaries.  He got three times the vote share that Barack Obama got back in 2012, which was the last time we had an incumbent running for reelection.  So we're safe to assume that 90% plus of the GOP ballots are all for Trump.  But what about the Democrat ballots?  You see, this was the huge assumption back in 2016 that Democrat ballots backed Hillary Clinton.  And just to put this all in perspective, let's take a walk down memory lane, shall we?  Take a look at this.  This is a Reuters piece published at the end of October, October 29th, 2016.  Here's how the piece starts.  With 11 days to go before the US presidential election, Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton leads Republican Donald Trump by 15 percentage points among early voters surveyed in the past two weeks, according to the Reuters-Ipsos States of the Nation project.  Though data is not available for all early voting states, Clinton enjoys an edge in swing states such as Ohio and Arizona, and in Republican Party strongholds such as Georgia and Texas.  An estimated 19 million Americans have voted so far in the election, according to the University of Florida's United States Election Project, accounting for as much as 20% of the electorate.  Overall, Clinton remained on track to win a majority of votes in the electoral college, the Reuters Ipsos survey showed.  So everyone just assumed that the Democrat ballots were overwhelmingly voting for Hillary.  However, when the dust cleared after November 8th, and the pollsters and pundits were reeling with shock to their core, trying to figure out what happened, we found that there were nearly 200 counties that had voted for the Democratic presidential candidate in every election since 1984 by a 20 point margin that suddenly swung over and voted for Trump by comparable 20 point margin.  There were counties after counties after counties, nearly 200 of them in Wisconsin, Iowa, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Minnesota that voted for Mondale and Dukakis and Clinton twice and Al Gore and Kerry and then Obama twice.  I should say not just voted for, but they gave the Democrat candidate a 20 point margin of victory over the last three decades.  All of a sudden to the shock of pollsters and pundits alike, these counties turned around and voted for Donald Trump by a comparable 20 point margin.  It represented a 40 point swing to the nationalist populist right.  That's why we really saw six Democrat mayors in the swing state of Minnesota turn around and endorse President Trump for reelection.  These Democrat mayors are part of this mass defection that started in 2016, and it appears that's even grown since now going into 2020.  Now remember, Trump won among whites without college degrees so much that even if Hillary had gotten Barack Obama's turnout among black voters, she still would have lost.  So I don't think all of these Democrat early ballots are voting for Biden by a long shot.  Regardless, even if we assume that, Trump is doing the unthinkable.  He's beating Biden in a state that had voted for every Democrat presidential nominee for 30 years up to 2016.  And Trump is doing it with the early voting.  In Texas, it's not even close.  It's not even fair to compare the two at this point.  Trump is blowing Biden out of the water by 10 points, 51 to 41%.  In fact, Biden is performing significantly worse in Texas than Hillary did by well over 30 points.  Again, just to give you a sense of things here, Hillary was beating Trump by nearly 20 points with the early voting in Texas four years ago.  That's how badly Joe Biden is doing there right now.  Now there's another problem for the Democrats with regard to their early voting strategy, and that's the collapse of the youth vote.  But first, as you can see, we have got some pretty awesome T-shirts and merch available.  by clicking on the link below in the pinned comment section, I'm wearing my personal favorite, my Sleepy Joe Biden shirt.

According to the early vote tallies thus far, the 18 to 29 year old college youth vote that the Democrats have become so dependent on has collapsed.  Check this out.  Quote, in Philadelphia, home to Temple University, Drexel, UPenn, and LaSalle University, the 18 to 29 year old youth vote has gone from 23.1% in 2016 and 12.5% in the midterms to 11.7% in 2020 now.  Gang, that's a collapse.  That's an implosion.  Biden's coalition is collapsing before our very eyes.  And it's not just Pennsylvania.  Check this out.  In Dane County, Wisconsin, home to University of Wisconsin-Madison, one of America's most liberal college towns, The youth vote has declined from 8% in 2016 to 7.3% now.  Analyst Larry Schweikart notes that this came as a big surprise as 27% of the total 2016 vote is already in.  And the Wisconsin youth vote was expected to be energized.  And so Schweikart has a fascinating prediction here.  He's noting that because college campuses are empty this year, more or less, right?  The Democrats are going to have to make up for that absence of mobilization.  So the college campus is a center for recruiting for Democrats.  And if there's nobody on campus to recruit to go and vote in person, right, then on election day, November 3rd, it's going to be a bust in terms of the 18 to 24 year old college age vote.  That means, according to Schwarzer, that if the Democrats are going to make up for that deficit, they need to have a 30% higher mail-in ballot return among college voters to make up for the shortfall on election day.  The Democrats are so far behind that number right now that we may in fact be seeing the college age vote, the so called young people's vote, collapse by two thirds.  One of the Democrats major voting constituencies may end up falling short of their 2016 vote tally by two thirds this year.  It's a total disaster.  Absolutely stunning fail on the part of the Democrats.  And again, keep in mind, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin are key swing states that Biden absolutely needs to win this election.  And it gets even worse for the Democrats.  You ready for this?  Gallup has just released their latest poll showing that for the first time since 2004, Republicans now outnumber Democrats in total voter affiliation.  In 2016, Democrats outnumbered Republicans 32% to 27%.  Now in 2020, the GOP outnumbers the Democrats 28% to 27%.  It's the first time in 16 years that the GOP outnumbered the Democrats.  In fact, the Democrats have lost 8% of their voter registration in just the last two years since 2018.  Now you don't hear much about that from the mainstream Marxist media, do you?  And what this means is that the GOP really is poised to post some big numbers on election day.  Here's what real election analysis has.  is their current electoral predictions based on the early vote mail-in ballots thus far.  So it's certainly not what Biden was hoping for.  This is not the map he wanted to be looking at two weeks before the elections.  So obviously, we'll be keeping our eyes on how things develop here.  And of course, as always, make sure to go out there and vote.  Don't take anything for granted.  But there's no question that Sleepy Joe Biden's campaign is imploding.  His early vote mail-in ballot strategy is collapsing.  And President Trump, in many ways, is already winning.
