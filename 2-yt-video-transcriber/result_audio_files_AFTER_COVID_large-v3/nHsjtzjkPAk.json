            "text": "What happened while we were away, brought to you by Storming the Capitol.  Extraordinary moment.  I don't know what else to say.  Anti-Kavanaugh chanting and then running.  Let's turn around and look at the door here.  And then this moment, just as they did at the Capitol, rushing to the top of the steps of the Supreme Court and now besieging the front door of the Supreme Court.  Sorry, wrong video.  if you see anybody from that cabinet in a restaurant in a department store at a gasoline station you get out and you create a crowd and you push back on them and you tell them they're not welcome.  wrong video again.  sorry i want to be clear in how i characterize this.  this is a mostly a protest.  uh it is not.  uh it is not generally speaking unruly but fires have been started and alive.  i'm having a bad day.  please show me where it says that protests are supposed to be polite and peaceful.  Actually, I changed my mind.  Those are the right videos.  Apparently, when you lock people in their homes, take away their jobs, tell them they can't go to church, applaud while race baiters cause a billion dollars in damage rioting all summer, then tell those same people they're crazy for believing the election, their only nonviolent recourse for pushing back against the madness, wasn't 100% on the up and up, this happens.  Apparent pro-Trump protesters gathered in Washington, D.C.  yesterday for a rally as a joint session of Congress met to count the Electoral College delegates and all but seal Joe Biden's win from November.  As President Trump was speaking at the aforementioned rally, a group of protesters broke off from the main event after they heard Vice President Mike Pence was not going to be engaging in any sort of protest.  In the hours that followed, the group of protesters turned violent, breaking into the U.S.  Capitol building, smashing glass windows and making their way into the House chambers.  Other rioters were able to make their way into congressional offices, including those of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.  One woman was shot by Capitol security, a married San Diego woman named Ashley Babbitt, who was a 35-year-old U.S.  Air Force veteran.  In all, four people died amidst the chaos at the Capitol yesterday, including Babbitt.  The joint session temporarily concluded before the House resumed activities last night. ",
