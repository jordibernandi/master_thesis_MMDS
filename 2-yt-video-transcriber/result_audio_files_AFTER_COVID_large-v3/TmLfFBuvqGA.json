Dizzy perfectly slammed Piers for his hoodwinking him, trying to get him to give his opinion on the White Lives Matter banner and utmost respect to Dizzy, he was having none of it.  Well done mate.  Obviously the media doesn't highlight this in the papers.  They actually twist it to say Dizzy swore and he's the naughty one.  Ha ha.  Check this video out. ",

Now the article out today is in the mail and this is where I show you it's twisted it.  so it was Dizzy that was wrong.  Nothing whatsoever to do with Piers.  Now it's titled, Dizzy Rascal snaps at Piers Morgan for asking about BLM with Susanna Reid forced to apologise when he swears live on air in awkward chat.  Look, swears in uppercase.  So yeah, it's BLM swears.  They're the two highlighting factors in all of this.  On top of that, have you noticed how it said awkward?  I wouldn't actually class that as awkward.  Let me say this, Piers, if White Lives Matter is racist, as you are desperate to insinuate and get other people to back you on it, so are BLM by definition.  And you, do you want to know why I think you're racist, Piers?  You suggested Dizzy has your opinion because he's black.  That is racist.  In my opinion, that is truly offensive, not a bloody banner.  The whole phrase reminds me of Joe Biden announcing, you know, if you don't know who you were voting for, you ain't black.  Exactly the same process.  Now, what's my opinion on this?  Morgan, Reid and the lamestream are playing white and bame against each other purposefully.  Poor versus poor.  while they profit.  We need to talk.  And to do that, we need to stop looking for race in everything and weaponising the slur.  It stopped all discussion, everyone.  And this is the result.  To Albain, workers and the poor white people are not your enemy.  The media are both of our enemies.  In my opinion, we should all defund the BBC, stop watching mainstream media, switch to independence while we still can.  Hurt them in the pocket and maybe, maybe they'll start being a little less baity, eh?  Ha ha ha.  But anyway, I'd like to know what your opinion on this is.  Do you think Dizzy did well?  I mean, he wasn't even brought onto the show to talk about this.  He was hoodwinked.  Effectively, they jumped him with racial comments that he had no intention of doing when he went on.  It was all about driving gigs that he'd set up so that we can still go to clubs and still see good gigs and stuff, which is bloody ridiculous.  But if that's what we've got to do to go to a concert, I suppose... We have to tuck it on the chin a little bit, don't we?  Hopefully it won't last for long, but it is a good idea.  So you can understand why he was annoyed when, within a very short period of time, he's already asking him about racial questions.  And he said the swearing was he didn't want to say anything because then he'd piss both sides off.  Which tells me Dizzy sees himself as a centrist, not extreme.  I think that is something that we need to applaud to the highest.  Individual thought.  And the only group he actually saw was everybody.  You noticed how he said that he should be able to, it doesn't matter what race, creed, colour, religion, you can all come and party at his concert.  Exactly not what Piers Morgan wanted him to say.  He wanted him to get on the bandwagon like he has, didn't he?  But anyway, thanks everyone that stopped by.  I appreciate it.  Say hello in the comments.  Hit the like, comment, subscribe, bell icon.  Share it out, everyone.  Stay safe and I'll see you on the next one. ",
