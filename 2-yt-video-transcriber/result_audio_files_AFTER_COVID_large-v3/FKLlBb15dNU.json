            "text": "Who's on the Lord's side?  I say, let's find out.  I don't know about you, but I don't wear a ceremonial uniform.  I wear the armor of God.  I don't know about you, but I don't listen to the prophets of Baal sitting behind a news desk.  I won't bow.  They have been fake news for quite a while.  Why would we listen to the fake news now?  The fact is no one is president-elect.  The fact is there has not been one state certified.  The fact is the votes are still being counted.  And the fact is we have God on our side.  And if God before us, what he said is going to change.  The fact is America is going to change.  Hell is not going to stop it.  A fact is revival is coming to America.  Hell is not going to stop it.  The fact is our government is going to change.  Hell is not going to stop it.  We've been praying for chaos and commotion and corruption to be exposed.  You just saw it.  A lot of people said, oh, no, no, it's not that bad.  It's not.  Well, you just saw.  They're willing to lie.  They're willing to be fraudulent.  They're willing to stop an election and in the middle of the night find justice.  Thousands of votes.  And the deplorables I know are not weak-kneed warriors.  I run with a crowd that believes what God says is possible.  It may have gotten harder, but it didn't get impossible.  I believe.  what he said, and I will not back down off of that.  I run with an ecclesia, thankfully, that is now raising up.  that is far different than what the world is used to seeing.  The world is used to saying, that's the way it is, be quiet.  An ekklesia is rising up.  It will not be quiet.  It will make it stand.  It will be in the streets making it stand.  It will raise its voice making it stand.  You can't get us to back down.  Most everything I have ever done in the kingdom has been difficult.  What part of spiritual warfare don't we understand?  Do you really think that hell expected to just say, well, I guess that's what the church wants.  So I guess we'll just have to let them have it.  No, he is doing exactly what the scripture tells us that he will do.  The kingdom of heaven will suffer violence.  But where are those who violently take it by force?  Where are those?  That will declare the word of the living God.  The promise of our king is that if his ecclesia will make their stand.  Matthew 16, 18.  How many times have we said it?  That he will build his church and the gates of hell will not prevail against it.  And whatever we forbid is going to be forbidden.  Whatever we permit is going to be permitted.  The Greek text reads it's conditional to our response.  What is our response?  Do we roll over and play dead or do we rise up and say no?  We stand for what God says.  We are going to see things turn around and we will not listen to your words of defiance.  There are a couple of scriptures that came to my mind this morning early when I woke up and I believe that these will be being now processed.  and there is a prophetic word I will give in just a few moments in the message.  But these words came to mind this morning.  Now, keep in mind, I didn't say these things.  Keep in mind, no prophet said these things.  Keep in mind that the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords, Jesus Christ, says these things.  Luke 8, 17.  For nothing is secret... that will not be revealed, nor anything hidden that will not be known and come to the light.  The Amplified Bible says, for there is nothing hidden that shall not be disclosed, nor anything secret that will not be known and revealed.  The New Living Translation says, For all that is secret will eventually be brought into the open, and everything that is concealed will be brought to the light and made known to all.  That will happen.  Psalms chapter 2 was the other verses running through my mind this morning.  Verse 1, Why the big noise, nations?  Why the mean plots.  Earth leaders push for positions.  Demagogues and delegates meet for their summit talks.  The God deniers.  The Messiah defiers.  Let's get free of God.  Cast loose from Messiah.  Heaven-thrown God breaks out laughing.  At first he is amused at their presumption.  Then he gets good and angry.  Furiously, he shuts them up.  God knows how to shut up our adversaries.  He knows how to shut things down.  And I am counting on him doing what he said he's going to do in our nation and in our lives.  I'm counting on it.  We said that God exposed the corruption and we saw corruption.  It didn't take a prophet to see it.  It was pretty clear.  We saw fraud and we saw disruption in front of our very eyes.  We actually saw the third coup attempt against this president.  But that being the case, What is our response?  Our response is to believe that what we have prayed is coming to pass.  God is going to expose corruption.  He just did it on a national scale.  There were hirelings.  There were hireling shepherds that had to be revealed as hirelings.  We now know who they are.  There are false prophets in the land.  We now know who they are.  There are people in the news media.  we thought we could trust.  Now we know we can't.  A lot was revealed.  And now it's being revealed who's on the Lord's side.  I'm believing that there is now going to come a rising of ecclesia patriots that are going to stand up like this world has never seen before.  And I'm going to be right in the middle of that.  It's like John Paul Jones said when surrounded by the British and they offered him a chance to surrender.  He said, I've yet begun to fight.  You're about to watch an ecclesia that you thought was fighting.  It's now going to take things to another level.  We're not going to be intimidated and we're not going to be bullied.  In our history, our church history, we see so many occasions similar to this.  They're instructive for our times.  First of all, we find out who is from the tribe of Ephraim.  Yes, unfortunately, we see many are in that tribe.  I hope there are none here.  But the tribe of Ephraim, we're told, was well armed.  They were very skilled warriors.  But on the day of battle, they ran.  Many ran.  and have been running.  I don't run with those who are scared and run away.  I suppose some of Gideon's army is being winnowed out, but I'm telling you, there are some fierce warriors, and I'm running with them.  I've been on phone calls, prayer calls with over 2,000 of them these past few days, and the warriors are starting to rise.  We're starting to see and now it's being exposed to the whole world what we are up against and the stand that must be made.  And we will make that stand.  We will do so.  We have understood that there are false prophets in the land and we will winnow them out.  We will stand against that in Jesus' name.  We will not roll over.  In the Exodus, we saw where Moses sent 12 spies into the land.  Here's what God's promised.  Here's the land that's before you.  You can have it, but you're going to have to battle for it.  You're going to have to go possess it, and it will be little by little, he said.  So I'm going to send 12 spies into the land, and we'll spy out how to do this.  And the story is... pretty well known.  ten spies came back and said we can't do it.  there are giants in the land There's a big opposition and we're inferior to them and we can't possibly do this.  Only two said they could.  Joshua and Caleb said they're bred for us.  The remnant said they're bred for us.  We'll take it.  We're going to possess the inheritance God said we could have and we're not going to back off of it.  But we are told that the people of God that were camped with Moses believed the ten that said, we can't do it.  In fact, we are told they begin to cry.  They begin to weep.  They acted like babies.  They begin to say things like, we should have just stayed in slavery.  We should have never left Egypt.  We should have known better.  We should have known God couldn't do what he said.  We should have known this.  And they begin to weep.  And we find out later on what God had to say about those 10.  He said their report was an evil report.  I will not give you an evil report.  I believe what God says.  We are well able to take this country.  We are well able to take the promises of God.  We are well able to possess our inheritance.  We are well able to win because God is with us.  And Daniel, I mean, he prays and God answers the prayer, but nobody knew it.  Daniel didn't know the prayer was answered.  On the first day he prayed, God sent the answer, but there was a 21 day war took place.  It actually took two divisions of angel armies to turn it around.  Michael's army came, Gabriel's army came.  What part of we are in spiritual battle don't we get?  Now I know many don't want to be in that battle, But there are some of us that are willing to rise up.  We are willing to give our lives if need be.  But we are going to turn this nation back to God.  And hell's not going to stop it.  The prophets of Baal are not going to stop it.  Nobody's going to stop it.  And so we're calling for the warriors to rise and make their stand.  There are a lot of great resources out there.  Dutch's website, Give Me 15.  He is now on daily giving a 15-minute update and prayer.  I would encourage you to go on and listen.  There are so many others.  But it is time for us to stand and believe what God says.  As the king said, it's conditional to our response.  If we give up on the promise of God, well, then we lose.  If we back down on the day of battle, then we lose.  Every promise in Scripture is conditional to whether we believe it and stand.  Now, we have worked for over 10 years.  I've been in all these counties.  I've been in the surrounding states and around America, and I'm not the only one.  I've given myself tirelessly to turn this nation around.  And so have most of my friends.  There are so many that have done that.  And know this.  Nothing that the prophets of Baal are saying is shaking our determination.  Nothing is backing us down.  If anything, we are going to raise and press the battle even harder.  And if anything, we are going to stand in confidence even more.  If anything, our voice will now grow louder.  In Jesus' name.  And we will think on ways to do that and we will win.  Get that in your head right now.  We are going to win.  We are going to win the battle for this nation.  I don't care how hard it gets.  Okay, get hard, get difficult.  That just makes our God's power demonstrated even greater.  Hell just built us a testimony.  Because I'm telling you what, revival's coming to America.  I know it.  I know it in my knower.  Awakening's coming to America.  I know it in my knower.  And I've heard some things from the Lord that I want to give you in a few moments from the scriptures.  that is a promise to you and a promise to us that I will deliver.  But I know many of you wondered what I... might be thinking right now.  I'm thinking I'm glad I'm on God's side.  that's what I'm thinking.  I'm glad I know my Redeemer lives.  I'm glad I know Jesus is Lord.  him fall off the throne Tuesday.  he wasn't taken by surprise And he's about to show the world who's boss.  That's what I believe.  You'll never get me to say anything different.  I'm sold out.  And it's not even a Christian thing completely.  You watch.  I'll just say this.  Even those who do not serve Jesus Christ as we do... have had it and they're going to make their stand with us.  god is bringing them from every kindred tribe and tongue and we need to be praying for the court situation.  we know that it's a contested election now and we know that the court is probably where things are going to be decided.  So we just pray that God will give understanding and the courts will make the right decisions.  Having said that, we won big in the election that just took place already, but we're not done winning.  And I will say this, and I believe it deep inside, God's not done with Donald J. Trump.  I don't know what his plan is.  I don't need to know what his plan is.  But he's not done yet.  What that entails, I don't know.  But I do know this.  God is not done yet.  Amen.  And so be it. ",
