Someone referred me, you know, through a link, and I have been listening to your videos, and I think a lot of what you're saying is very true, particularly about, you know, women and relationships and things of that nature.  But I will have to say, though, I sense a sense of it seems like you're bitter against women in their 40s.  I am a woman in my 40s.  I am a single woman.  I was raised by my father.  I'm from the Midwest.  I'm from Detroit.  You know, I'm educated.  I have a degree.  But the thing about it is the women who are in my area and during the time that I came out of school, our parents, you know, really were like, you know what, focus on your education.  Don't worry about getting married.  You know, you want to be able to take care of yourself.  And I think a lot of that comes from them seeing pitiful, pitiful black men, frankly. ",

You made a statement of saying that I strike you as, quote, bitter at women over 40.  Now, bitter is a word.  OK, be quiet.  Bitter is a word that has a definition.  You can't just be some ignoramus grabbing a word and using it out of context without its definition.  So in the definition of the word bitter, what is it that you have heard that sounds bitter? ",

It could be that you're just a very weak individual who when you hear the truth, you're just so sensitive because it strikes you in a place you don't like that to you, the truth is just harsh to you.  That could be a positive.  Well, you know what?  Could that actually?  That could be.  Okay, thank you.  So if that could be, then it may be you're just a weak person and that hearing the truth for the first time ever, you just interpret it as harsh because you've never actually had to deal with somebody telling the straight truth without trying to taint it or dilute it to spare your feelings.  So it may just be that you're a bit weak.  You're probably a bit weak and fragile.  And it's maybe time for you to actually take a look in the mirror and say, wow, I've been kind of weak and fragile.  And I mistake that for my weakness and my fragility because I've never had people talk to me honestly before.  I've insisted that they lied to me.  In my weakness and fragility, I have become a person who's so weak.  that I interpret something as basic as truth to be, quote, harsh. ",

First of all, she said, you're bitter about women over 40.  That's a female who blew it in her 20s.  She blew it.  She had her chance.  She had her opportunity to get it popping.  She failed.  She blew it.  She's probably one of these females in her case.  She probably went to college and failed to get her degree, but she does have the kids and everything else in tow.  And she blew it.  So now she's angry that the black males who are producers and let's just be very clear she also admitted and conceded what she was really angry about.  did you hear what she said?  and the problem is that because you got some black men like you who y'all got a little money and you you got a little money up on you and she's looking around at her situation and she's looking around in her life and she's saying to herself well i'll be damned.  She's saying to herself, I'll be damned.  You see, it's one thing when you hear these things from a fellow who ain't got it.  It's one thing when you hear these things from a fellow that you know it ain't right.  It's one thing when you hear these things from a fellow who doesn't have the intellectual, mental, psychological, or financial resources.  It's one thing when you hear it from him.  It's quite another thing when you hear it from a dude who you know his paper is straight.  You know his papers straight.  So she admitted and exposed what she's really angry about.  You got these black men who when they gets middle age, they money is straight.  They got a little paper up on them and you done left us big old big jiggly middle age broads behind.  Yeah, we did.  Can't lie.  Yeah, we did.  Can't lie to you.  You that 88 Corolla with 400,000 miles on you, baby.  I can't, what am I supposed to do with this? ",
