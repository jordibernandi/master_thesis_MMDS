Camille Cosby unleashes on ABC Interview Part 2.  Dr.  Camille Cosby is no stranger to black men being railroaded by the system of oppression in this country.  Now, I'm taking off the kid gloves here in my writing.  You know I write, right?  I write all these scripts.  I give careful thought to every word that I say.  I have a certain set of philosophies that I believe in.  A lot of you all have been miseducated as to what to actually believe in.  For you black people who think that you're liberal, for you black people who think that you're Democrat, I have a 50-point questionnaire test that I can give you that would demonstrate to you that you would absolutely fail, that you're not liberal, that you're not Democrat, that liberal and Democrat and Socialism is completely against everything that you actually believe and have been raised to believe in the black culture.  You have a culture, and your culture is screaming out against everything that you're doing when you're voting Democrat and all that sort of stuff.  I'm not saying who you should vote for, but I have a 50-point questionnaire that you would fail miserably.  Now, back to Dr.  Camille Cosby.  She's no stranger to women being used not only to destroy the reputation of black men in America, but also them being used to utterly destroy the black men themselves physically. ",

He's dead now, deceased.  The writer James Baldwin.  And I'm going to just... reference one line which i think will answer your question and i will expound on that.  but ignorance outlawed with power is the most ferocious enemy justice can have and i'm going to add the word intentional.  the metoo movement and movements like them have intentional ignorance pertaining to the history particular white women, not all white women, but particular white women who have, from the very beginning, pertaining to the enslavement of African people, accused black males of sexual assault without any proof whatsoever.  No proof anywhere on the face of the earth.  And by ignoring that history, they have put out a lie in itself, and that is because I'm female, I'm telling the truth.  Well, history disproves that as well.  And gender has never, ever equated with truth.  So they need to clean up their acts.  And all of us as women who have not participated in anything nefarious, we know how women can lie.  We know how they can do the same things that men do, that some men do, because there are good men and bad men.  There are good women and bad women. ",

In an interview with ABC that wasn't a rabid form of scandal, clickbait, and hopping on the bandwagon to say Cosby was guilty, guilty, guilty, Dr.  Camille Cosby was allowed to lay out exactly what these women were doing and allowed to do right in front of everyone.  Also, she's no fan of the Me Too crowd.  Who, who have all been accused by men themselves of the same exact thing they are accusing Cosby of.  The irony of this movement is just like a Hollywood script.  Don't believe it?  Go look it up.  I'm sure the news isn't going to report that the Me Too movement leaders have all been accused.  All been accused.  It is now coming out that Dr.  Camille Cosby marched for the Civil Rights Movement in the 60s.  and knows firsthand the danger of women, specifically white women, accusing black men of even looking at them.  Imagine this.  This movement was so gung-ho about getting Cosby a rich black man that the legal system changed its laws just to bring a case against him.  That's right, folks.  The statute of limitation had run out.  before the case could be brought.  But they changed the dates to get it in court.  Now imagine a state that does that.  What possibly could be the state where that could happen?  And now imagine all of the arguments that the South is anti-Black, but then this is the North.  Imagine if you were actually taught the truth in school, that the North was just as anti-black as the south and race wars were started in the north minimum wage was passed to prevent blacks from taking jobs.  all in the north.

And she said, I was in the 60s movement, and we're still dealing with the same issues.  And it is horrific that America still is dealing with the same issues, but it is the foundation of America's history.  It dates back to the enslavement of African people, and there have been humongous problems of injustice, of stereotypes to make those who are hateful free to inflict pain on those who they have projected as being subhuman.  It is a horrific interconnection of these historical times pertaining to the real history of the United States of America, which is immersed in violence and bigotry and just overall hatefulness. ",

She never fell for the okey-doke that a Pennsylvania court threw out the Constitution, threw out court rules, threw out district attorney procedure, threw out court procedure, threw out judicial precedent all across the land, all to get Cosby.  Never fell on a blind eye of Dr.  Camille Cosby.  Political, financial, social prisoner, is not far-fetched in this case to call him, nor is it even over the top as an accusation when all the players conspired after a hung jury said there was no case at all to proceed to launch a kangaroo court, find him guilty, of course, and then, to add insult to injury, give him a sentence of 10 extra years if he doesn't admit guilty.  to the very guilt they just put on him in their canker court without a single shred of evidence.  Even two women on the stand confessed that they made it up.  Nothing happened.  Right on the stand. ",

That's the only way to get rid of these folks.  But I can only say that there was never any proof, just a whole lot of allegations.  I understand that, but still, among so many women who have made claims, they have not ever, none of them, presented any proof.  And I think that says a lot. ",

Now, if you remember, the appeals court was just as ridiculous as the trial court.  The justices attacked Cosby's team... and literally smiled and blushed at the district attorney's team.  Folks, you can't get more corrupt than that.  You can't get more corrupt than how dare you bring this appeal to us, you terrible people, and object to everything that the Cosby team brings up.  But now, we're in state Supreme Court, but this is one step closer to the U.S.  Supreme Court.  If the Pennsylvania State Supreme Court is just as corrupt as the rest of the lower courts.  We have the U.S.  Supreme Court, where sits Clarence Thomas and Justice Kavanaugh.  And they're not going to fall for no 50-year-old accusation without a single shred of evidence, no police record at all, nothing.  And a trial judge that broke every legal rule in his own court to convict Cosby.  Meanwhile, idiots are still calling Cosby a predator.  Go back to sleep and please don't vote.

Emmett Till's outcome to mutilate his body in the way that it was was just really so deeply horrendous.  there isn't?  i mean there there's a lack of words for that kind of hatefulness.  but see years ago i interviewed the survivors from the tulsa oklahoma riots in 1921 And that was another case of a white female making a claim, a sexual assault claim against a black male, which we all know, if we know about the Tulsa, Oklahoma riots, and gave license to mobs of white people converging on a very independent, economically independent, educationally independent black community named Greenwood in Tulsa.  And hundreds of people were killed.  But these unproven allegations, it doesn't even fit in with laws in our country.  You've got to prove stuff.  My husband was under the scrutiny of several federal entities during the time of Nixon's presidency.  He was on that infamous Nixon's list.  But for four years, he was harassed by the Internal Revenue, by the FBI, and all that.  If he had done all those things these women are claiming, it certainly would have come out then.  And in this country, It is impossible for any black man, I don't care how much money he has, how popular he is, to get away with raping a white woman.  That is just absolutely impossible. ",
