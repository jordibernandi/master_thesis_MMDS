More lockdowns, mass virus testing and public space closures across the country.  100 million doses of domestic vaccines for Chinese people.  And another 100 million doses will be imported from Germany, maybe for another group.  How corrupt are Chinese officials?  Their embezzled money could fill the trillion-dollar gap of China's pension fund, and the list of corrupt officials could replace the country's rich list.  Hong Kongers' freedoms diminished greatly over recent months due to the new national security law attacks happening in broad daylight.  And the data of Americans is in the hands of the CCP.  Zoom gives its user data to the Chinese regime so the company can stay in the country's huge market.  Welcome to China InfoKiss.  I'm Tiffany Meyer.  Virus cases are on the rise across many provinces in China.  The situation appears to be severe, with lockdowns, mass virus testing, and public space closures in the country.  Here's more on the story from NTD's Don Ma. ",

On Sunday, authorities ordered lockdowns in the province's Dalian City.  Fourteen schools were closed, as well as general clinics, supermarkets, some hospitals, and public spaces.  According to China's numbers, at least six people tested positive in the city.  A local resident in Dalian's Jingzhou District tells us about the situation. ",

Canada has given it full approval.  Now we look to Hong Kong.  Hong Kong bans all flights arriving from the UK on Tuesday.  It comes after a new strain of the CCP virus was detected in Britain.  The new ban rules that people who have stayed for more than two hours in the UK over the past 14 days would shortly be banned from boarding any flights to Hong Kong.  The ban includes Hong Kong residents.  It's no surprise that Hong Kong became the first city in Asia to announce such a halt.  As a former British colony, Hong Kong has more ties to the UK than any other Asian city.  At the end of November, Hong Kong saw a spike in the number of cases.  As a result, authorities once again shut down restaurants after 6 p.m.  and closed gyms and beauty salons.  The measures will be in place until at least January the 6th.  China, Japan and South Korea say they are monitoring the new strain.  The UK says the new strain could be more infectious.  Its European neighbors in several other countries, including Canada and Iran, closed their doors to travelers from the country.  Now we look to the deficits of China's pension system and an expert's proposal for filling the gap.  China's pension system is facing serious deficits.  Official data shows that in the coming years, China is expected to have a pension gap of more than one trillion dollars.  Former governor of China's central bank, Dai Xianglong, offers a solution.  Over the weekend, Dai suggested at a meeting that a certain percentage of land transfer funds and assets of corrupt officials could be transferred to replenish pension reserves.  He said the court has confiscated a lot of money from corrupt officials.  Each confiscation amounts to millions or billions of dollars.  Dai was also chairman of China's National Social Security Fund.  A summary from China's official figures shows since 2012, about 470 high-ranking officials have been punished due to corruption.  At least 80 of them embezzled over 15 million dollars.  One Chinese army official embezzled $3 billion.  Chinese state media revealed this amount.  The real number could be much higher.  Some netizens said this list of corrupt officials is the real Chinese rich list.  Some other netizens said if the money confiscated from all the corrupt officials is evenly distributed to every Chinese person, China will instantly rank among the top 10 richest countries per capita in the world.  And where has this billions and even trillions of dollars gone?  The CCP Central Commission for Discipline Inspection says the stolen money had been turned over to the state treasury.  Dai also suggested the land the state acquired from people does not necessarily have to be used for building houses.  Instead, part of it can be used for pension funds.  In Hong Kong, followers of the spiritual practice Falun Gong say they've been under attack in recent weeks.  Their protest sites against the CCP's persecution have been repeatedly damaged by unidentified persons.  NTD's Sarah Liang has more. ",

Last weekend, two more stands underwent the same.  For 20 years, adherents of the spiritual practice Falun Gong have taken to the streets to expose China's persecution of followers through information stands, among other means.  They speak to Hong Kong locals and tourists from mainland China.  On Saturday, a man in his late 50s to 60s ripped the banners and display boards at one of the Falun Gong stands.  When practitioners there asked him why, he didn't say a word and ran away in a hurry.  Later, he ventured across the highway.  Around six people took pictures of his sabotage on their mobile phones.  One of those there had seen a similar attack on a stand the weekend before.  Afterward, the man went to another stand to do the same and dropped display boards into nearby water.  On Sunday, a man suspected to be the same person went to some other protest stands attempting the same acts of vandalism.  Falun Gong practitioners called the police.  The police investigated and retrieved the display boards out of water from the day before. ",

            "text": "Former Zoom executive Jin Xinjiang worked with Chinese authorities to provide data of users outside of China.  Card documents say this allowed Zoom to keep market access in China.  Although Zoom is based in the  U.S.,  its software is developed in China.  When Zoom usage exploded during the pandemic, China tightened control.  It ordered Zoom employees to shut down what Beijing calls illegal meetings and illegal accounts within one minute.  If it took more than one minute to shut down, it was rated as security non-compliant.  Victims include activists commemorating the Tiananmen Square massacre and Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang, China.  Zoom says it's cooperating with federal investigators and has launched an internal investigation.  Zoom fired Jin and placed other employees on administrative leave.  The CCP demands all communications companies to censor speech it deems unacceptable.  Anyone who fails to comply gets blocked from the massive Chinese market.  In September last year, the CCP blocked Zoom.  It allegedly told Zoom that if it wanted to get back into the Chinese market, It had to monitor user communications, censor unacceptable topics, release private information on nearly 1 million people in the US, and hand over special access to Zoom's systems.  Zoom got back into the Chinese market in November of last year. ",
