            "text": "It is so typical that cars go driving past.  So I'm going to project my voice a little bit as well.  But I'm here in Casa Cunda and so I wanted to show you from another site.  Casa Cunda is really huge.  So I wanted to show you from another site here where there are the additional plots.  So there are how many plots here?  There are 50 plots here available here in Casa Cunda.  Now, they're all the same price, they're just different locations.  So I wanted you to have choice because I sent you some plot maps and they're all different.  And I think I created some confusion.  So I don't want to create confusion.  So I just wanted to come and show you all the different plots so you can see.  There's also one huge place in Casa Cunda here that was available with 400 plots.  But... Ja Oyo has obtained that land.  So what we are doing is offering other alternative plots, same price, same terms and conditions.  Same area.  Same area.  So I just wanted to take you to another plot in Casa Cunda so that you can see another area in Casa Cunda and I've got another one to show you as well.  So bear with me as I take you around Casa Cunda.  Jambanjali is also not far from here as well.  So for everyone who's in Phase 2 Jambanjali, you're also not far from here.  But I've taken some shots just to show you the local area and it is just beautiful here and it's quiet and it's nice.  What's it like in rainy season driving on this road?  So there you have it.  So you need a driver with a four-wheel.  We'll have to get Peter a four-wheel drive.  So he can drive you around.  But once you've got a four-wheel drive, you're okay, basically.  But obviously, it's going to take time for you to clear the land, build on it, and do your wall, do your borehole, and then start to build.  That all takes time.  And who knows what might change in that time, because a lot changed in the time since I bought my land.  So yeah, just wanted to share with you.  Thank you so much for taking us here.  It's absolutely beautiful.  There has to be a change in the usage of the land.  So as soon as that's done, you'll be free to come and purchase here and that will be done shortly.  So basically, there are other property developers in this area as well.  So I'm going to go and discover all of the different plots so you can see.  So this is the beautiful Casa Cunda.  I love Casa Cunda.  It's a gorgeous, gorgeous area.  It's very lush.  It's very green.  It's full of lots of beautiful plants and trees.  And I don't think you should take your trees off your land.  I think you should include them and keep them.  at least a couple of trees or at least one tree on your land so you can talk to uh mr gel about that when you buy your plots.  tip family blacks it.  family blacks it family.  i just want to say um hello and welcome to casa conda and um thank you for watching thank you for subscribing and thank you for sharing.  as you know i'm just sharing with you different parts of the beautiful Republic of the Gambia.  This place is absolutely gorgeous.  When I say that, it's a paradise.  I mean, it's a veritable paradise.  It is the place that, you know, you can find your peace of heart, your peace of mind and your inner tranquility in a natural setting in nature.  And I think that's really important that, you know, you are allowed to embrace nature because for far too long, we've been living in concrete cities, concrete jungles and everything that we've done has been in a box.  So I think this gets you out of the box, out of your usual comfort zone and back into nature.  So Blacksit family, I'd like for you to join me on my journey showing you different plots in Casa Cunda that are available for you to purchase.  And so this is going to be really exciting, really interesting and I'm really, really looking forward to it.  The last thing that I want to say before we go is, you know, look at all the shots that I'm going to be making.  I've also got drone shots of Casa Cunda as well.  that i'll be showing you.  and but please get in there fast.  i don't want to have disappointment like what happened before.  so because we were a little bit slow in getting it all done um you know the plots were bought from under us.  so let's make it quick quick fat fat as they say here and um let's get it done.  so this is a quick short video just to show you casacunda the beauty of casacunda the beauty of the gambia the beauty of africa.  and remember come and see because seeing is knowing seeing is knowing.  don't listen to people that have just got their own negative perspective on things.  come and make your own mind up about things yourself.  i've been coming here since 2011 and i don't share the views of some you know commentators about africa and and it's not because i look through at life through rose-colored glasses it's because i know what i see and i can share with you also through the lens of my camera.
