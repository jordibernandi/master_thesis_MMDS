This happens day in and day out, not just in London, but many cities and villages and towns around Britain.  Often the officer is alone.  Fortunately, there were two officers there, one black female and one white male.  And the white male at one point was in a headlock and could hardly breathe.  What is it that the Black Lives Matter group were talking about?  I can't breathe.  Well, yesterday afternoon, one of my colleagues couldn't breathe for a little while and had the black suspect not let go of him.  Who knows what could have happened? ",

I believe unless we can get the proper police officers on the beat, and they're the ones that are level one, they're the ones with shields.  We don't have riot squads, what we have is territorial support groups that have the shields.  I believe that a frontline police officer in London is going to be murdered very soon.

We've seen it on the night that Boris Johnson was elected, where he had a sort of vile crowd chanting outside of Downing Street.  You know, I would guarantee you that many of these people are the same people, but the trouble with the Black Lives Matter movement, is that it has also attracted what I would regard as a criminal element who are anti-police, who spend their lives committing crime, probably dealing drugs, and they see this as a great opportunity to crack a few policemen's heads.
