This, in fact, is my first objection to Craig's presentation.  Despite the fact that he is well-versed in mathematics, having studied Cantorian set theory for his work on the Kalam, he has not provided us with a clear definition of mathematics, and so we're going to have to infer his definition from his surrounding words.  To be clear, this is not an objection to the argument, but rather its presentation.  In philosophy, definitions are paramount, especially when the definition of a keyword is contentious. ",

To answer the opening question through this prism, mathematics works because that is precisely what we've designed it to do.  So much so, in fact, that when it doesn't work, which is to say, when it doesn't correlate with reality, we alter its axioms so that it does.

Within his short article, Wigner uses the word miracle twelve times, as he considers, for instance, the fact that we can predict anything in the future to be a miracle, and he compares the miracle of mathematics playing a role in quantum theory to the miracle that the human mind can string a thousand arguments together without getting into contradictions.

Charles Darwin once wrote that a mathematician is a blind man in a dark room looking for a black cat which isn't there, and I would say that this fairly summarises the fact that while we have good reason to suspect that the mathematics that applies to our environment also applies to radically different environments, we do not know with certainty that it does.  in any case i and evidently many mathematicians and physicists do not consider the effectiveness of mathematics to be unreasonable let alone miraculous.  i would in fact be more shocked and find it more unreasonable if our mathematics did not apply to other macroscopic environments.  This is to say that so far as I'm concerned, Craig is committing a black and white fallacy, in which black is God and white is coincidence .  He spent a total of 30 seconds attempting to justify why the only other option to God is happy coincidence.  But as expressed earlier, naturalists have a plethora of ways to account for the effectiveness of mathematics, including the one I have given throughout. ",

Craig has challenged me, in fact, more than any other theist I've read, but his argumentation here strikes me as jarringly poor.  by assuming that the properties of the universe are built upon mathematics rather than that mathematics is built upon the properties of the universe craig has put the cart before the horse.  his argument is essentially a reskin of presuppositionalism in which he has replaced the laws of logic with the axioms of mathematics.  Now, to ensure that Craig's specific presentation here isn't simply a weak rendition, I've listened to him debating the philosopher Dr.  Graham Oppie on this very argument, and I've digested just about every video on YouTube I can find of him discussing the topic.  But I've found nothing of greater substance than what's found in this short, polished presentation. ",
