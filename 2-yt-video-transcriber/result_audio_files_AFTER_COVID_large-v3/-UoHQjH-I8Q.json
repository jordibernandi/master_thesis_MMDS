And if you have got 12 kids or you're living on your own, lock it down and isolate and stay the fuck at home.  If you think you're not at risk here, you're living in a dome.  It spreads faster than a hooker's leg, so stay the fuck at home.  I need the gym.  I need the beach.  I hear you bitch and moan.  You need to grow a brain cell and stay the fuck at home.  But I feel fine.  I don't feel sick.  I'll go out on my own.  How thick are you, you selfish prick?  Please just stay the fuck at home.  From L.A.  through to Berlin, from Wuhan through to Rome, there's people dying every day, so stay the fuck at home.  If you need to contact family, use Facebook, Skype, or phone.  We've got the fucking internet, so stay the fuck at home.  The only way to slow it down is isolate, not roam.  Please help the world get back on track and stay the fuck at home.  Stay the fuck at home.  Stay the fuck at home.  Don't you be a fucking dick.  Please stay the fuck at home.  Stay the fuck at home. ",
