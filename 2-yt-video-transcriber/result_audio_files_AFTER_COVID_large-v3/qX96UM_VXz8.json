            "text": "Shalom, shalom, my brothers and sisters.  What I am about to share.  was revealed in a dream to a brother in my church, Lyle.  Lyle, thank you, love you.  Lyle will be the first to tell you.  He doesn't like to get on camera, and if he did, he would tell you that he is humbled, that the Lord would reveal this to him, and he gives all the glory to God.  It's not about Lyle.  It's not about me.  It's not about you.  It's about Jesus, amen, and all the glory to God.  Everything that Holy Spirit inspired him to put on paper Lyle had dreams about.  He saw the Gog and Magog.  He saw the events in a dream.  But I want to read for you what Holy Spirit led our brother to put on paper.  And it is confirming to things that are going on in the geopolitical with the prophetic.  It's confirming to many other believers' dreams and visions and what's going on in this season.  So I am compelled to share this.  It says, I am the Lord your God.  I am the morning star.  I am the one.  who adopted Yisrael as my own.  Soon I will cast my line and draw Gog and Magog to me with a hook in their mouths.  At that time, I will mete out my justice and protect my beloved.  It will not be just on the sacred land of my people, but worldwide.  and people he's talking about in Yisrael.  We know that everyone who believed on the Lord Jesus, his redemptive work on the cross at Calvary, the ABCs of salvation will be in the description box, his death, burial, and resurrection, from Jews or the Goim, the nations, are the body of Christ and the bride of Christ.  And we will be Harpazo soon.  But anyway, he says, I will not only be, it will not only be just on the sacred land and my adopted people, but worldwide.  That is why I am snatching you away so quickly.  The Harpazo.  And so he goes on.  So here's the thing.  In the message that he got, the Lord was saying, that is why he is snatching us away so quickly.  Well, why?  What did the Lord tell him before him?  What did he see before God meeting out his judgment?  Brothers and sisters, this is so confirming.  And in light, so many people are afraid that, oh, what are we going to go through?  Listen, we are not appointed unto wrath.  So again, Lyle, thank you for sharing.  God bless you.  God bless you all.  Until we are soon snatched out of here, harpazoed, let's occupy and redeem the time.  Boldly share the gospel.  The gospel and the ABCs of salvation is in the description box.  I've done a video.  Faith plus nothing equals salvation and eternal security.  Oh, brothers and sisters, so many, so many, even from this channel family, are having visions and dreams and confirmations.  and just that knowing, that knowing that we are harpazoed very shortly.  God bless you guys.  Shalom, shalom, shalom aleichem, and have an awesome rest of your day. ",
