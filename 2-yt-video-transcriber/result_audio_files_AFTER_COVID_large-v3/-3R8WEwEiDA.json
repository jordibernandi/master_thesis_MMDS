Another one coming.  There's a parade of them.  I'm shaking!  What is... What is wrong with people?  I... I... Can I speak to the... driver?  And they fucking boxed me in, and they're pointing at me, and laughing at me, saying, These are human beings, these are lions!  Because they wouldn't let me out, I was trying to go around it, and they're literally even like, pointing at me, and laughing at a Mexican.  I could have crashed, I could have fucking crashed, it was so dangerous.  Hi.  Okay, so my last three attempts to get an Uber have resulted in 33 dead, 17 injured, 12 people driven off into the wilderness, never to be seen again, and nine people driven absolutely nowhere but mad.  Um... Is it at all possible that you could get me to Fifth Main before the- Fuck off!  I fucking hate you!  Why?  Why?  What is-?  What is wrong with you?  I just saw a fucking pro-life sign driving down the fucking road having a mental breakdown!  And I just wanna say all you people are so- You're so fucking stupid!  You had a mental breakdown from a sign, is that right?  Your words, not mine.  You saw some kind of billboard poster and it caused your brain to break.  Pardon me awfully, but hearing your opinion on stupid people is like hearing a stroke victim's opinion on asymmetrical people.  Why can't women have abortions?  Look, it's the 50s.  There's nothing we can do about it.  What?  I was born and I can feel pain.  I wish I wasn't fucking born.  Right.  Well, that's fairly normal, actually, compared with any... I mean, no one ever wishes they weren't born because no one's ever really not born.  But the issue I sense you're having with being alive and whatnot is the pain it involves.  In which case, might I suggest aspirin?  It might be preferable to not existing at all.  Take two and call me in the morning.  If that doesn't work, take a whole bunch more.  One way or another, you're going to get where you want to go.  Speaking of which, could I... Oh, yeah, yeah, good point, never mind.  Oh, is that a coyote?  Stop bringing these fucking kids into horrible fucking homes!  No, an actual coyote.  You're fucking stupid!  And I wish I could fucking avoid it!  Please do not crash!  Would you please pull up?  All right, thank you.  I'm literally so fucking tired of this fucking... Can we please... Where am I?  Who the fuck are you?  Everything's mine.  This had better not be another bloody rape.  This was the whole point of banning men from driving cabs.  Amy Connie Barrett was just confirmed to the Supreme Court, so, um... Is this man hell?  How long have I been in man hell?  Because it feels like a lot longer than this step.  So, um, all those times I said I was queer, oh my god, you guys, that was so funny.  I get the premise you're doing, but you uploaded this to TikTok.  You're feeding all this controversial personal information of yours to the Chinese government, but you're worried about Amy Coney Barrett.  I mean, you're actually retarded.  All those times I said men don't deserve rights.  Oh yeah, I forgot.  Earth is... And help.  Oh my god, men are so great.  I need a husband to show me how to... Have to conceive of the notion of human rights being deserved by people who aren't like you.  How to be an adult.  How to function.  I'm... Dumb woman know no numbers.  Remember that had anything to do with numbers.  It was all just words and you're not even any good at that.  I can't know what I'm supposed to do other than pray for death.  Terrified!  Good, sweet lord, what is that?  Listen to me, Republicans, listen!  Yes?  You are the people in history they warned us about!  I see.  I'm not quite sure who they is, but I feel I should inform you that the persons, places and things you may find in what we call history are not entities about which any warnings are required.  They are in the past.  They have already happened.  They literally cannot do anything to harm you.  Warnings.  are given from history, not about it.  I'm fairly sure that's what you meant to say, and you're not actually terrified of what the dead people are going to do to you in the distant past, but I can't be certain.  In any case, it's quite imperative that you learn how to speak before you attempt it.  And especially before you were tempted at quite such a volume.  Pay attention!  I am paying attention, you microwaved side of ham!  You are not talking to your hyperactive brats now!  You can smack your own fatherless husks of children around the local flea market without repercussions, but you're talking to the fucking world now!  And you do not own it!  IS THAT  CLEAR?!  WE'RE LOSING OUR DEMO- NOR CAN YOU WIN A SHOUTING MATCH AGAINST IT, MADAM!  ON GUARD!  THE PEOPLE IS HESITATING!  THE PEOPLE IS HESITATING!  THE PEOPLE IS HESITATING!  THE PEOPLE IS HESITATING!  THE PEOPLE IS HESITATING!  THE PEOPLE IS HESITATING!  Happy Halloween, y'all.  I hate men.  I walk past them and I want to kill them.  And they aren't even doing anything.  I just see them and it fills me with rage.  I don't know how to stop.  It's gone way too far. ",
