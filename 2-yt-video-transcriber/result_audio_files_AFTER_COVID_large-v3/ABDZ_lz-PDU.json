This situation is far more complicated than they make it out to seem.  So many people have asked me, why is this happening?  How is it possible that one incident in Minneapolis can cause rioting all across the world?  We're seeing riots in France, we're seeing riots in England, we're seeing riots all across Europe, and of course, all throughout the United States.  So what is the reason for this?  Well, before we get into this interview from 1984, I'm going to leave you with some words from Malcolm X. This was recorded in 1963. ",

Both want power, but the white liberal is the one who has perfected the art of posing as the Negro's friend and benefactor.  And by winning the friendship and support of the Negro, the white liberal is able to use the Negro as a pawn or a weapon in this political football game that is constantly raging between the white liberals and the white conservatives.  The American Negro is nothing but a political football, and the white liberals control this ball through tricks or tokenism, false promises of integration and civil rights.  In this game of deceiving and using the American Negro, the white liberals have complete cooperation of the Negro civil rights leader, who sell our people out for a few crumbs of token recognition, token gain, Token progress.

            "text": "Yuri Alexandrovich Bezmenov.  Mr.  Bezmenov was born in 1939 in a suburb of Moscow.  He was the son of a high-ranking Soviet army officer.  He was educated in the elite schools inside the Soviet Union and became an expert in Indian culture and Indian languages.  He had an outstanding career with Novosti, which was the, and still is, I should say, the press arm or the press agency of the Soviet Union.  It turns out that this is also a front for the KGB.  He escaped to the West in 1970 after becoming totally disgusted with the Soviet system, and he did this at great risk to his life.  He certainly is one of the world's outstanding experts on the subject of Soviet propaganda and disinformation and active measures.  Well, you spoke several times before about ideological subversion.  That is a phrase that I'm afraid some Americans don't fully understand.  When the Soviets used the phrase ideological subversion, what do they mean by it? ",

            "text": "Ideological subversion is the slow process which we call either ideological subversion or active measures, in the language of the KGB, or psychological warfare.  What it basically means is to change the perception of reality of every American to such an extent that despite of the abundance of information, no one is able to come to sensible conclusions in the interests of defending themselves, their families, their community and their country.  It's a great brainwashing process which goes very slow and it's divided in four basic stages.  The first one being demoralization.  It takes from 15 to 20 years to demoralize a nation.  Why that many years?  Because this is the minimum number of years which requires to educate one generation of students, in the country of your enemy, exposed to the ideology of the enemy.  In other words, Marxism-Leninism ideology is being pumped into the soft heads of at least three generations of American students without being challenged or counterbalanced by the basic values of Americanism, American patriotism.  The demoralization process in the United States is basically completed already for the last 25 years.  Actually, it's overfulfilled because demoralization now reaches such areas where previously not even Comrade Andropov and all his experts would even dream of such a tremendous success.  Most of it is done by Americans to Americans, thanks to lack of moral standards.  As I mentioned before, exposure to true information does not matter anymore.  A person who was demoralized is unable to assess true information.  The facts tell nothing to him.  Even if I shower him with information, with authentic proof, with documents, with pictures, even if I take him by force to the Soviet Union and show him concentration camp, he will refuse to believe it.  until he is going to receive a kick in his fat bottom.  When a military boot crashes his balls, then he will understand, but not before that.  That's the tragic of the situation of demoralization.  The next stage is destabilization.  This time, subverter does not care about your ideas and the patterns of your consumption.  Whether you eat junk food and get fat and flabby doesn't matter anymore.  This time, and it takes only from two to five years to destabilize a nation, what matters is essentials.  Economy, foreign relations, defense systems.  And you can see it quite clearly that in some areas, in such sensitive areas as defense and economy, the influence of Marxist-Leninist ideas in the United States is absolutely fantastic.  I could never believe it 14 years ago when I landed in this part of the world that the process will go that fast.  The next stage, of course, is crisis.  It may take only up to six weeks to bring a country to the verge of crisis.  You can see it in Central America now.  And after crisis, with a violent change of power, structure, and economy, you have so-called the period of normalization.  It may last indefinitely.  Normalization is a cynical expression borrowed from Soviet propaganda.  When the Soviet tanks moved into Czechoslovakia in 1968, Comrade Brezhnev said, now the situation in brotherly Czechoslovakia is normalized.  This is what will happen in the United States if you allow all these schmucks to bring the country to crisis.  to promise people all kinds of goodies and the paradise on earth, to destabilize your economy, to eliminate the principle of free market competition, and to put a big brother government in Washington,  D.C.,  with benevolent dictators like Walter Mondale, who will promise lots of things, never mind whether the promises are fulfilled or not.  Your leftists in United States, all these professors and all these beautiful civil rights defenders, they are instrumental in the process of the subversion only to destabilize the nation.  When their job is completed, they are not needed anymore.  They know too much.  Some of them, when they get disillusioned, when they see that Marxist Lenin has come to power, obviously they get offended.  They think that they will come to power.  That will never happen, of course.  They will be lined up against the wall and shot.  But they may turn into the most bitter enemies of Marxist-Leninists when they come to power.  And that's what happened in Nicaragua.  You remember most of these former Marxist-Leninists were either put to prison or one of them split and now he's working against Sandinistas.  It happened in Grenada when Maurice Bishop, he was already a Marxist, he was executed by a new Marxist who was more Marxist than this Marxist.  Same happened in Afghanistan when first there was Taraki, he was killed by Amin, then Amin was killed by Babrak Karmal with the help of KGB.  Same happened in Bangladesh when Mujibur Rahman, very pro-Soviet leftist, was assassinated by his own Marxist-Leninist military comrades.  It's the same pattern everywhere.  The time bomb is ticking with every second.  The disaster is coming closer and closer.  Unlike myself, you will have nowhere to defect. ",
