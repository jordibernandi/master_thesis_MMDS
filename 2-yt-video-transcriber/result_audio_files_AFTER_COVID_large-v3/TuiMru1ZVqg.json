            "text": "They say that all poets must have an unrequited love.  and when I say they I mean Terence Trent Darby because that's a lyric from a Terence Trent Darby song which I remember mulling over and musing over when I lived in the land of perennial heartbreak and adolescence that I revisited as an adult.  I've always had that tendency to fixate in my case on a member of the opposite sex if indeed words like opposite sex are applicable now because there are many many ways of interpreting those ideas.  so for me females when i was a adolescent females when i was in my 20s 30s oh continual obsession fixation.  for me it was not.  whilst i've had problems with lust and objectification in the past i've also had a kind of problem with a rather romantic and i would say emotionally immature tendency to deify people that i fall in love with.  now i'm sure that this is a ubiquitous and universal tendency that simply bears the inflection of one's personal preferences.  To wit, we make other people sacred in the absence of a true relationship with the sacred.  When I think of the emotions I felt, I want you, I need you, you complete me.  I'll even think of the more colloquial terms that we use around romantic love, my other half.  is there's a sort of discarded and initially satirical Platonic idea that we are one being cast asunder.  This is a sort of a reference to, I think it's Plato's Republic, which one of the people makes a joke about, that's why we're always yearning.  It's like some people were bonded to someone of the same gender, some of a different gender.  and that we spend our lives trying to recreate this wholeness.  Whilst this may have been meant as a kind of sort of joke, I suppose, in platonic terms at least, I feel that what is pertinent about it is this sense of incompleteness, that we will not be okay if we do not have the other person.  If someone has broken your heart, if there's a person that you... use, as it were, as the mandala, the fetish, the object of your heartbreak.  Oh, if only I could have that person.  Because I'm older now and it's happened so many times to me, the face of that individual has changed.  But the quality of the emotion remained the same.  A sense of inferiority, a sense of failing, a sense of deep, deep yearning and longing, a very powerful and authentic sense that I have to have this person.  When I was even younger, it was people that I'd perhaps not even been in relationships with, going right the way back to being, you know, seven, eight years old and having crushes and obsessions and fixations.  But now, now I'm married contentedly, happily, occasionally, blissfully married.  I have a different perspective on relationships where I don't look at my partner as a kind of counterpoint to my own emotions but an autonomous individual who's living on parallel lines to me, sharing a domestic space and in the duties of In our case, raising children together, keeping a home running and checking in that we have a shared vision.  In the past, when I had relationships that failed and that led to yearning and heartbreak, I was looking for a sense of redemption.  And I mean redemption in the kind of religious sense that I wanted to belong to something else.  I wanted to be redeemed.  I wanted to be owned by a higher thing.  Because a romantic love is such an authentic endorphin flood that you lose the tiny self amidst the hormonal tundra.  The tininess of your constructed persona blasted aside like an autumnal detritus in the powerful wind of this deep, deep emotion.  From where is it resourced?  We may allocate those feelings to this person, I'm in love with this man, I'm in love with this woman, I'm in love with this person, but what is it really?  What is this yearning really?  What is it to indeed want?  My feeling is it's something that must be resolved within us, that we have to look inside ourself and say, even though I believe that I should be with that person, that cannot be the case because I am not with that person.  We have to let go Not only of the person, but of our self-centered belief that we know what is right.  In a sense, when we are caught in this egoic miasma of heartbreak, we are like pitiful gods that say, I know how reality should be.  and reality hasn't gone that way and it is my job to bend reality to my inner vision.  when instead what is required as the feelings themselves suggest because let's face it they're pretty powerful feelings they bring you loha.  the depression the despair the loss.  these feelings are all guiding us towards humility.  humility as I understand it and more importantly as the dictionary defines it awareness of our relative insignificance.  of our relative insignificance not of our worthlessness because we are valuable as each individual is valuable.  we are valuable as all things that we share the planet and indeed the cosmos with have a value.  but for us to become immersed in this sort of egoic willfulness I must have this.  that shouldn't have happened.  This is a journey to pain and self-damage.  So what I reckon you have to do, you have to say, even though I know I feel really bad now, I will feel better again.  Otherwise, you know what you'll do, and what I have done, is that I've just transferred the feelings of heartbreak onto another person.  I remember one time when I was having this, it wasn't that long ago really, when my heart was sort of broken by the end of a relationship.  I toughened up a bit because I'd been around the block a few times, so I sort of knew how to sort of shut off.  But inside I was in a sort of a great deal of pain, and I would have stayed with that person if I felt like I could have made it work.  I remember not long after, I was in some rebound situation, and I remember thinking the exact thoughts that I'd felt about the other person.  And I thought, oh my God, it's me.  It's all in me.  How can this person, who couldn't have been more different from the person I'd previously been in love with, be eliciting the exact same problem.  They can't be objectively similar.  It must be that I am projecting this on them.  And then on a deeper psychological level, of course, the same way that there's a limitation to the electromagnetic range of visual phenomena, surely the same is true of emotional and psychic phenomena, i.e.  we only know the part of the person that we are able to know.  We only witness the part of a person we are able to receive.  Now I believe, truly, truly I do, in a kind of a sensual connection, a oneness that can be achieved through love with your children, with your friends, with a partner, with whoever.  But often it's we construct a kind of hologram inside our heads of the other person and then worship this false idol, expect it somehow to fulfil us.  So, you've got to let go of that.  you've got to let that evaporate.  all pain is an invitation to burn ego.  all pain is an invitation to let go of something and man.  I must have a lot of ego to let go off because I experience a lot of pain not only through heartbreak but through addiction through yearning through belief in my own status.  all these things all lead to pain all lead to loss.  so if you are not loved by a person that you think should love you if you're experiencing unrequited love if you have had your heart broken and you do not know how to move on.  you have to recognize that none of the things you are seeking are in the other person no matter how much you believe that it's kind of like.  you have to recognize your inner matrix like god.  i know i think that this is the problem and that that is the solution but for now just for today i'm willing to admit that I don't know what's right for me, and that this pain is information, and that this pain is trying to guide me.  Get yourself ready to receive the true information, because the true information, the truth itself, is not what you believe it's going to be.  But there is a great discovery to be made beneath that pain, and do not impede this revelation by continuing to return to your old illusion. ",
