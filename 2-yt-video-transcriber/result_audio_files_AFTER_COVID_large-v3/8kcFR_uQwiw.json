            "text": "As the 2016 National Football League season got underway, an open letter was written by retired Marine Colonel Jeffrey Powers to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell about players kneeling during the United States National Anthem.  Colonel Power's letter is more relevant now than then, and whatever we think of American foreign policy over the years and the wars she fought, the memory of the men who gave their lives cannot and must not be dishonored by a privileged few who have paid millions of dollars to play a game here in America.  As we read this letter, let's resolve to boycott the NFL here in 2020.  Let's do this in honor of those who will never live to see old age, who will never live to see their children grow up, and will never see another football game.  Here's the letter.  Commissioner Goodell.  I've been a seasoned pass holder at Yankee Stadium, Yale Bowl, and Giant Stadium.  I missed the 90-91 season because I was with a battalion of Marines in Desert Storm.  Fourteen of my wonderful Marines returned home with the American flag draped across their lifeless bodies.  My last conversation with one of them, Sergeant Garrett Mongrella, was all about how the Giants are going to win the Super Bowl.  He never got to see it.  Many friends, Marines, and Special Forces soldiers who worked with me and for me through the years returned home with the American flag draped across their coffins.  Now I watch multi-millionaire athletes who never did anything in their lives but play a game.  disrespect what brave Americans fought and died for.  They are essentially spitting in the faces and on the graves of real men.  Men who have actually done something for this country, besides playing with a ball and believing there's something special.  They're not.  My Marines and soldiers were.  You are complicit in this, Commissioner Goodell.  You'll fine players for large and small infractions, but you lack the moral courage and respect for our nation and the fallen to put an immediate stop to this.  Yes, I know, it's their First Amendment right to behave in such a despicable manner.  What would happen if they came out and disrespected you or your refs publicly?  I observed a player getting a personal foul for twerking in the end zone after scoring.  I guess that's much worse than disrespecting the flag and our national anthem.  Hmm.  Isn't it his First Amendment right to express himself like an idiot in the end zone?  Why is taunting not allowed, yet taunting America is fine?  You fine players for wearing 9-11 commemorative shoes, yet you allow scum on the sidelines to sit, kneel, or pump their pathetic fist in the air.  They are so deprived with their multi-million dollar contracts for playing a freaking game.  You condone it all by your refusal to act.  You're just as bad and disgusting as they are.  I hope Americans boycott any sponsor who supports that rabble you call the NFL.  I hope they turn off the TV when any team allows this disrespect to occur without consequences on the sidelines.  And I applaud those who have not.  Legends and heroes do not wear shoulder pads.  They wear body armor and carry rifles.  They make minimum wage and spend months and years away from their families.  They don't do it for one hour on a Sunday.  They do it 24-7, often with lead, not footballs, coming in their direction.  They watch their brothers carted off in pieces, not on a gurney to get their knee ice.  They don't even have ice.  Many don't have legs or arms.  Some of these heroes wear blue and they risk their lives daily in the streets of America.  They wear fire helmets and they go upstairs into the fire rather than down to safety.  On 9-11, hundreds vanished.  They are the heroes.  I hope that your high-paid, protesting pretty boys and you look into that mirror when you shave tomorrow and see what you really are.  Legends in your own minds.  You need to hit the road and take those worms with you.  It's time to change the channel.  Colonel Jeffrey A. Powers, United States Marine Corps, retired. ",
