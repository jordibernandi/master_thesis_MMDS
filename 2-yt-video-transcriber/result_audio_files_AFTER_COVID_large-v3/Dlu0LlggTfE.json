            "text": "Hello there!  I'm Lloyd Evans and you're watching the John Cedars Channel from the bunker.  And in this video we simply must talk about Allard Jones and the song Listen, Obey and Be Blessed.  Gosh, this has come out of left field.  Just when you think 2020 could not get more crazy, we get the mother of all curveballs Allard Jones, I should explain, for those of you in America or basically anywhere other than the UK.  Allard Jones sort of shot to fame as a child singer in the 1980s.  He sang... the song Walking in the Air in the 1982 film The Snowman.  I don't think it's all that unkind to say that his career probably peaked at that point, but he has since had a career nonetheless.  He is a radio and TV presenter.  He's currently a presenter on Classic FM, which is a very popular radio station in the UK playing classical music.  And he has been prolific in releasing albums.  I believe this current album that we're talking about, which I'll get into... is his 40th album.  So the guy has made a lot of albums.  Anyway, for all I know, he's a perfectly pleasant chap.  and a noted celebrity in the UK.  And out of nowhere, yesterday on Twitter, I can't even remember who it was that first tweeted it, but it became clear that Allard Jones has released an album, or is releasing an album, called Blessings, which is essentially an interfaith project.  In other words, it's a compilation of of different songs.  Alad is singing from different religions.  So I think Hinduism is represented, Islam is represented, obviously Christianity is represented.  And on the track listing, is Listen, Obey and Be Blessed, which Jehovah's Witnesses know very well, since it featured on the 2012 Become Jehovah's Friend DVD, which launched the characters Caleb and Sophia.  It was their debut, you could say, in terms of their horrendous cartoons, which are intended to manipulate and indoctrinate children.  But the song Listen, Obey and Be Blessed featured on this DVD, And it's a well-known song for Jehovah's Witnesses.  I'm not going to play it because if you're a Jehovah's Witness, you'll know exactly which song it is.  If you're not familiar, just check the links below.  I'll have a link to Aled's version as well.  But it's in the current songbook.  Sing out joyfully to Jehovah.  It's song number 89.  There we go.  Listen, obey and be blessed.  And I can confirm that Allard has stuck very closely to the original lyrics, which speak about the need for obeying.  Interestingly, Allard seems to pronounce it as obey rather than obey.  I'm not sure what's going on there.  Anyway, listen, obey, and be blessed.  Obviously, to anyone who's an outsider, I suppose obey would still be a curious word to have in a Christian song.  But in any case, if you're an outsider, you probably aren't going to think too much about the lyrics.  They are calling for total obedience to not just Jesus... not just Jehovah, but to the governing body who get to interpret what it is that Jesus is teaching and what it is that Jehovah is saying.  And if you don't listen and obey their instructions, you won't be blessed.  In other words, you won't survive Armageddon.  You'll literally die.  It's not just about prosperity and better relationships in life.  It's literally about your ability to survive an imminent act of global genocide, which is what Armageddon is.  That's what the song really means.  I don't think Allard will have even remotely considered that that's what he's singing about on this album.  But anyway, the obvious question is, how on earth has this come about?  How is it that spiritual food in the form of a Jehovah's Witness kingdom melody or hymn is being sung by a worldly singer or On a worldly album that is being sold, who's collecting the royalties?  What on earth has been going on behind the scenes to make all of this even a thing that we're talking about?  Now, I've condensed it down to three theories as to what's happening here.  And I'm not entirely sure which one of these theories it is.  I will leave it to you, the viewer, to speculate.  And once I'm any clearer on this subject, I guess I'll do a follow-up video so that it will be clear, hopefully at some point, what on earth's gone on.  Theory number one.  Warner Brothers owns the intellectual property of Listen, Obey and Be Blessed, having been commissioned to produce the song by Watchtower and has licensed it to Watchtower.  That's probably the most outlandish theory.  It's the one I least favor, although it's not entirely unprecedented.  When you consider that Watchtower does use third parties to supply some of its materials.  in its propaganda, most notably at the end of the Remain Loyal to Jehovah 2016 convention, A song was played called Eternal Flame.  That song was actually by Audio Machine.  So Watchtower couldn't be bothered to devote resources to coming up with their own song.  They brought in a third-party track from a worldly band, from a worldly creator audio machine, and they used that for their final song at the Remain, or their final music video, I should say, for their Remain Loyal to Jehovah 2016 convention.  So there is a little bit of form with that, but I still find it very unlikely that when it comes to the actual songs that Jehovah's Witnesses are singing in their worship, in other words, their spiritual food, I find it very unlikely that Watchtower has commissioned worldly creators or worldly artists to come up with their melodies or come up with their songs.  Nevertheless, it's still, I guess, technically possible, so I've included that as theory number one.  Theory number two, Watchtower owns the song, it's their intellectual property, and they licensed it to Warner Music Group.  I should mention that the reason why we know Warner is using the song is when you actually dig up the details online of this version, this cover version that Allard Jones is singing.  It indicates that the rights are held by WMG, which is the Warner Music Group.  So it's possible that a deal has been struck whereby Warner Music Group includes this song on Aled Jones's new album, and they have to pay a cut of the royalties to Watchtower, which raises all sorts of ethical issues for an organisation that, number one, dissuades witnesses from pursuing any sort of career in Satan's system of things, And number two, claims to be supported by voluntary contributions from its followers if they're instead milking opportunities and cutting deals with worldly record companies.  What do we learn about the organization from that?  Surely there's a double standard there when it comes to, again, the vitriolic rhetoric when it comes to denouncing Satan's system of things.  And theory number three.  Warner used Watchtower's song without permission.  This too seems unlikely for me.  I've already heard, because I'm following this on Twitter, there are a few ex-Jehovah's Witnesses on Twitter that are all over this.  And one possibility is that Allard Jones and Warner have just gone ahead and and included this song without giving a second thought to the intellectual property and copyright aspect.  I find that unlikely because it's the most rookie mistake you can make as a recording artist if you're making a covers album.  It's the most rookie mistake you can make to just do a bunch of songs and not even think about the royalties, not even think about the copyright.  That, again, seems quite unlikely.  But nevertheless... Those are the three theories that I'm presenting.  You decide which seems more likely.  I suppose there are any number of other variables from those theories.  Music rights and intellectual property and copyright, I'm sure, is a very complicated field.  And there will be many people who understand it all better than I do.  But those are the three theories that I'm currently working with.  And again, once I know more at some point, I will obviously do an update video.  But here we are, this bizarre situation where a worldly singer is including spiritual food, a kingdom melody, on his Interfaith music album.  It's interesting that apparently he has a cathedral tour planned.  I don't know how this is even going to work in terms of COVID.  How on earth do you even plan for something like this?  But yeah, he's supposed to be doing a tour around a bunch of cathedrals in 2021 between April and June.  One of the cathedrals, interestingly, is Chelmsford Cathedral.  So nice and convenient for the Bethelites to attend if they want to hear one of their own songs sung in a local cathedral.  But I hope I'm not the only one who just notices the glaring irony here because cathedrals are, in the view of Jehovah's Witnesses, places of worship to Babylon the Great, the world empire of false religion, that are soon to be destroyed.  And I have here for you an image.  It's from the recent book, Pure Worship of Jehovah Restored at Last.  This is an image of a dilapidated church.  And in the book itself, here we are, Pure Worship, of Jehovah restored at last.  This image appears on page 171.  And you have here again this picture of a cathedral or church.  And the caption reads, the governments of this world will turn against Babylon the Great in an expression of God's judgment.  So, Aled Jones, apparently COVID permitting, will be touring around cathedrals singing a song that is spiritual food from the faithful slave, from God's organization, That's the song of an organization that craves the destruction of these cathedrals where Allard is singing and looks forward to the time when the governments of this world turn against Babylon the Great in an expression of God's judgment.  These cathedrals where Allard Jones will be singing, listen, obey and be blessed.  As far as Jehovah's Witnesses are concerned, oughtn't be there or should be converted to heaps of rubble.  There's that small issue.  If Watchtower has commissioned, going back to theory number two, if Watchtower has given Warner Music Group permission for Alan Jones to include this song on their album, we then have the small issue of interfaith.  Is there hypocrisy there?  Because when you go to the baptism questions, question number 24 in the OD book, in the organized to do Jehovah's will book, And I should mention the baptism questions are the questions that every Jehovah's Witness has to go through in order to demonstrate that they know enough to get baptised as one of Jehovah's Witnesses.  And question number 24 is, why do Jehovah's Witnesses not worship with other religious groups?  Two verses from the Bible are quoted.  You cannot be partaking of the table of Jehovah and the table of demons.  That's 1 Corinthians 10 verse 21.  Separate yourself, says Jehovah, and quit touching the unclean thing and I will take you in.  That's 2 Corinthians 6 verse 17.  So if theory number two is correct... How is Watchtower completely throwing away this idea of interfaith, this idea of worshipping with other religious groups being an aberration?  How are they just throwing this away just so they can receive a royalty check?  Again, we don't know whether they've done that.  We're still in the dark at this point.  But these are questions that deserve answers.  And finally, if Warner Music Group and Alla Jones have used this song without Watchtower's permission, which again, rookie mistake, are they really going to do that?  But if that has happened, Watchtower needs to go after them and get this song removed from the album and make sure that it is no longer used in any way, shape or form.  by Allard Jones, otherwise there is a glaring double standard when it comes to their approach to copyright because we're talking about an organisation that sued the Truth and Transparency Foundation over a bunch of convention videos that were posted to that particular website, without Watchtower's spin, without Watchtower having an opportunity to tell people how they should be interpreted, Watchtower lawyers went after the Truth and Transparency Foundation, eventually reaching a settlement with them.  They've been shown to be very aggressive in litigating against almost anyone, or at least threatening to litigate against almost anyone who uses their intellectual property in a way they don't approve of, if they don't go after Warner Music Group, if they don't go after Ali Jones, if they don't shut this whole thing down, you have another double standard.  because they're using copyright law in a very arbitrary, cynical way to simply shut down criticism or shut down transparency, but they're allowing other people to use their intellectual property if it makes them money or if it shows their beliefs in a favorable light.  So whichever way you cut the cake, Whichever one of these theories you subscribe to, there are serious questions to ask.  So I think we need some answers.  And I don't have all the answers.  I'm just making you all aware of what's happening.  Once I do have answers, I will obviously revisit this whole thing.  But I'm interested to hear what you all make of it in the comments.  Which of the three theories do you think is most likely?  Let me know.  But that's all I have for you.  Don't forget to subscribe to the John Cedars channel for more such videos.  And as always, thank you for watching.  Oh, it's all over, I fell from the top of the world But it's finally over, finally over.  I've got a last one minute just to get out of life So I keep it together, thinking it's not forever. ",
