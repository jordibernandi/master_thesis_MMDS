            "text": "Hi, my name's Phil.  I like talking about politics and in this video I'd like to discuss how a group of Brexiteers that stood on the platform of anti-immigration have immigrated that same platform from the UK to Ireland, or at least they've tried to, in order to avoid the complications of the Brexit that they've pushed, but also how A member of one of the parties in the Irish government, not terribly impressed with their presence, had pushed for a bit of an investigation.  They're not exactly rolling out the red carpet for these guys.  But first, if you'd like to be notified of daily news and politics, please subscribe to the channel and click the bell notification icon.  So the Leave.eu campaign, headed up by the likes of Aaron Banks and Nigel Farage, moved its operations overseas as a result of Brexit.  You know, like a lot of other Brexiteers, really.  Really quite interesting how so many committed Brexiteers have moved either their entire businesses or their money and or themselves out of the UK, isn't it?  Now, this came a couple of weeks ago, I think, and it was of mild interest to me at first.  But it was really just another example of the Brexit rats locking Britain's rudder on a collision course with the iceberg and then nicking all the lifeboats.  And then Neil Richmond of Fine Gael, who's Leo Varadkar's party, but it's now in no longer, it's the coalition, it's in coalition now.  and he started to get involved.  He made a speech in the Irish Parliament.  He is the party's spokesperson for European affairs, and he described Leave.eu's move as an incursion into democracy.  He regards them as a threat.  Now, the sentiment, I suppose, will be particularly keenly felt I would imagine, you know, given not only the events in the UK over the past few years and the direct involvement of this group, but the United States as well, because both the UK and the US have had a serious problem in that we have allowed charlatans to spill their bile completely unchecked.  Neither country even had a government willing to denounce the lies, much less a robust media to do so, particularly in the UK on that latter one.  And I was reading this week of a former Conservative minister who said that David Cameron actually regretted letting the Daily Mail describe senior judges as enemies of the people, for example.  Now, I don't know if that's true or not.  And in a sense, it doesn't really matter because what is certain is that that sort of rhetoric was permitted with no robust challenge from our government, whether it was Cameron's government or May's government or Boris Johnson's government.  In fact, Boris Johnson, you know, in him, we have a prime minister who uses this rhetoric.  It's not just that he allows it to go unchecked.  He uses it and then he promotes others who also have no problem using it into senior positions in government.  Same happened in the United States.  You know, clearly there are other countries who do not yet suffer from or at least this extreme of poison and would like to keep it that way.  and i would remind people that the likes of steve bannon and nigel farage are not done with europe.  you know their purpose wasn't just um pulling britain out of the eu.  they have sought to break up the eu itself.  you know they um.  they've tried to promote their brand of disunity on the continent in italy for example.  so far they've gained no traction.  And it seems to me that Neil Richon doesn't want Ireland hosting these people either.  He said, and I quote, this organisation is a threat to our democracy.  It is a politically subversive organisation that if allowed to gain a foothold in our democracy will have an absolutely detrimental effect.  Now, I was reading a report that he noted their links to anti-immigration groups beyond just the Brexit sphere of influence and support for Trumpism, for example.  And I do hope that others in the Irish government take this seriously, as seriously as Richmond does.  because in the same report and you know there are several of these reports we're going to link one below because it also included a response from leave.eu's Andy Wigmore in the description below.  Wigmore responded with an insult and a challenge to the Irish government.  Now I have to say It goes beyond simply bad manners to move your business to another country.  And then basically your first public statement is, following this move, is to insult the government of your new host nation.  Wigmore said when he was challenged about the curious move, it's a bit curious, isn't it?  You're all fans of Brexit, Britain, and you move away from Britain that's now outside of the EU to a country that's a committed member of the EU.  And Wigmore's response, again, a quote, any more nonsense from Brussels lovers like you and we may decide to put the full weight of Leave.eu behind IREXIT.  Now, here's the thing.  I agree with Richmond.  These people aren't just unpleasant bullies.  They've issued a direct challenge to Ireland, their people, their media, their government.  We're here whether you like it or not, they're saying.  And if you keep annoying us, we'll boot you out the EU just like we did Britain.  Now, bullies can respond to a number of reactions.  I'm not going to say there's only one way to deal with a bully, but there are some ways that definitely don't work.  And if you ignore them, that just empowers them.  That definitely doesn't work.  So Richmond writes to raise the issue in the Irish Parliament and implore the government to make it clear that Leave.eu are not welcome.  Now, There will be, I mean, at the moment, I don't know that there's too much of a suggestion as such that they wouldn't be allowed to move that domain.  But there's a couple of little wrinkles here.  I mean, you know, on the face of it, you would think, well, they can move it as long as they do it lawfully.  Yeah, sure.  They're not, you know, their organisation isn't on a list of banned organisations, isn't it?  And as long as they comply with Ireland's laws, of course they can operate.  But, you know, you would say, well, there should at least be rigorous scrutiny of their activities.  and this gives you one reason why.  so something at the end of the article that i linked.  so in setting up their operations in ireland they registered using the name of a sean power.  now mr power was approached for comment by journalists and he said he had nothing to do with leave.eu.  he had no idea why his name was being used and he was going to get his lawyers to have a look at it.  now One of two things is the case here.  Either Power is lying, in which case you'd have to ask, why is he lying if there's nothing untoward going on?  So straight away the suspicion of something untoward going on.  Or he's not lying, in which case this domain has been registered in Ireland fraudulently.  They've literally put a false name on there.  So from that point of view, it's worth some extra scrutiny.  And I will just point out finally, maybe some people have been screaming this in the comments already.  If you try and look up their website, leave.eu, It's not there at the moment, the point at which I'm recording this.  I don't expect it to be there suddenly tomorrow either.  Now, the suspension could be temporary.  It could be because of this.  It could be because there's some discrepancy here.  The person in whose name it's been registered publicly has claimed it's got nothing to do with it.  That alone could lead to the suspension of it.  It may just be whilst an investigation going up.  I'm not saying it's been knocked down completely.  I'm not saying that this is the Irish government saying we don't want your sort here.  We're blocking any registration of any interest in our country.  It may not be that.  It could just be with an investigation and maybe Leave.eu will sort it all out and they'll comply with the laws of the land and it'll be back up again there.  I don't know, but it's not there right now.  And it's a sign that Ireland are not going to welcome these people and that maybe they do regard them as the threats that Richmond does.  But in the meantime, I'm going to be keeping a bit of an eye on this one.  Until then, those are my thoughts.  Let me know yours in the comments below.  Hope you found the video interesting.
