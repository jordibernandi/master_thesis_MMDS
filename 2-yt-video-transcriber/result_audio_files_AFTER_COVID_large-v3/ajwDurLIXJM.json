In this video we're going to be having a look at a freedom bid by the Shetland Islands in Scotland.  Now I don't know if you know, but they have been talking about this for some time.  The main argument that they've got is the SNP government have effectively forgotten about them and cut funding and help and that the decision making has become increasingly centralised.  So effectively, they feel like they've lost the voice.  We can understand that, can't we?  Now, what they're actually looking to do is separate from Scotland altogether and operate and be governed as a Crown dependency, such as Jersey, Guernsey, something like that, rather than setting themselves up as an independent nation.  I think that would be ridiculous.  Crown dependency means that they would have the same status, similar to the Isle of Man, Guernsey, that sort of thing.  So they would be still part of the UK.  but would have some self-determination included with that as well.  So they would be able to make decisions for themselves more than they are at the moment, being completely forgot by the SNP.  All I can say is, welcome.  But I'm actually happy at this, because if you think about it, if the Shetland Islands want out of Scotland, how can Sturgeon say no?  Think about it.  If she says no... after moaning for so long that the Scottish people are being ignored, and their wills are being ignored, and therefore that deserves an independence vote, it's got to work the same way for Shetland, hasn't it?  Got yourself in a sticky situation here, hasn't you?  And I actually know a couple of people in the Shetland Islands, and I'm really, really chuffed about this, to be honest, because they have effectively removed all powers away from the people that live there.  And if you have a look at where the Shetland Islands are... They should be slightly self-determinant, shouldn't they?  Am I wrong on that one?  Now, the motion itself was signed by 18, 4 and 2 against.  So it was an overwhelming vote as well.  The Shetland Islands has a population of roughly 23,000 people.  So there is quite a number of people there.  Let's have a look at them.  You see that?  Viking, get in, fella.  I love that outfit.  Look at the helmet.  That's brilliant.  What they've done as well, one of the councillors, Mr Coots, I think he's called, has come out quoting Mr Salmon's statement.  We believe that the people who live and work in Scotland are best placed to make decisions about our future.  He said, replace the Scotland with Shetland.  And that's the motion we've got here today.  And he's encouraging everyone to support it.  I actually do support it.  But I'd like to know your opinion on this one.  Do you think Sturgeon is going to, and the SNP are going to allow them to gain independence?  I can't see them having any other option, can you?  I think this is a masterful play by Shetland and I can 100% appreciate it.  If you think, if all of their powers is being taken away and centralised, isn't that exactly why we voted for Brexit in the first place?  Because that was what happened to us.  I'm right, aren't I?  So they can't say no, but they don't want to say yeah, do they?  Oh, she's got herself in a nasty situation.  She's going to come back and bite at this one.  But what I say to you, everyone, I'd like to know your opinion.  First one of the day, I thought we'd have a cheer up.  We crankies going to be fishing in the wind.  Stay safe, everyone.  See you on the next one. ",
