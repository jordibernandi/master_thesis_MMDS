            "text": "Hello, this is Today's Frankly Five and we're taking a little walk on the walkway over the Hudson and I wanted to show you what it looks like.  We'll walk over to the other side and I'll show you up the Hudson River.  And we're going to start this Franklin in five on this bridge and I'm going to finish it from my home.  There's a lot of people here and there's a lot of other things I'd like to share with you.  that happened today.  So stick with me and I'll see you back at home.  We're back here at my home and I just wanted to finish our conversation.  Our day went well.  We made it back from the, from the bridge and from the doctor.  And I just want to thank everybody for your continued prayers and your support.  They have been extremely encouraging and needed.  And it's just very overwhelming to hear from people all over the world.  So I want to make sure I say thank you to that.  Also, I want to share with you a couple lessons that I've learned through all of this.  And I'm going to talk to the men.  If you're a lady and you're watching this and you have a husband, make sure he sees this video.  A couple things that I've learned about my wife.  Not only do I love her very much, but I've learned that I need to listen to her a lot more than I did in the past.  She sees things about me that I've never, I couldn't see about myself.  She gave me warnings that I didn't listen to.  And I am now.  And it takes some big things to happen in life for men to listen.  Sometimes their pride has to be broken.  And let me just say through this process, my pride has been broken.  And a thank you to all the people that have taken care of me at the hospital, to my wife visiting every day, even though I didn't see her.  because I was out in a coma.  But I just want to just say thank you.  I want to thank all the women out there who take care of other people.  You're highly respected.  And that's one of the lessons that I've learned through this, how important a good wife is.  And you'll see the verse that I'm going to put up on the screen.  It comes from the Old Testament.  And it's in reference to a good wife.  And so I just want to thank again.  This is a Franklin in five finishing up from my koi pond.  And I will be introducing you again to the new baby, new baby pigeons that have been born and are now flying.  So we'll do that again.  Thank you.  And I'll see you.  God bless. ",
