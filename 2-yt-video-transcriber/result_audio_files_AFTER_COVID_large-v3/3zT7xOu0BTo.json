I wanted to let you know that I, along with everyone else, have been trying my best to make sure that I don't invade other people's privacy or dishearten them in any way.  But we've really developed a couple of distinct parties, the mask party and the non-mask party.  And I was saying to our pastoral team the other day that Romans 14, I think, is a bit of a help in this, insofar as the people that Paul is addressing were equally committed to Jesus and they were strong in their faith, and yet he describes some as weak and some as strong.  And the issue there, again, is not a matter of their spiritual stability, but it is their perspective on things, debatable matters.  In the case of Romans 14, diets and special days.  And I think there are some principles that apply as we try and navigate these strange waters now.  And I think that Paul's advice earlier than chapter 14, where I think it's in chapter 12, he says, inasmuch as it is possible for you, try to live in peace with one another.  So, as we think of being back in one another's company, let's pay heed to that, and let's not judge one another, but prefer one another in love. ",
