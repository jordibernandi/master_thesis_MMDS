God, we lift up our voices right now in America.  And God, we believe, Lord, that you have anointed, that you have set Donald Trump in office, that you have given him authority to make decrees.  And Lord, we agree with him, Lord, that around the time of Passover, God, even now, Lord, stretch out your hands, Lord, to hold back this plague.  Lord, awaken your people in the earth to the critical hour that we're living in.  Lord, we say yes to the harvest of souls that is coming.  Lord, we say yes that will come out of April.  Lord, more empowered, more encouraged, more having our priorities straight than ever before.  And Lord, we pray for the baby boomers.  Lord, we pray for those who are falling sick.  God, we ask, Lord, for supernatural healing and strength, and we bind the spirit of fear in Jesus' name.  And you have not given us a spirit of fear, but love, power, and a sound mind in Jesus' name.

Jeremiah knows who it is, but I'm not even gonna call his name.  I'm going to say, we want that man or woman that God, you yourself have selected in office.  And I believe that these prayers, Especially the corporate prayer that will occur during Pesach, Passover, or Resurrection Sunday will push it over.
