            "text": "The Atheist Debates Patreon Project presents Moving the Goalposts.  On a recent episode of The Atheist Experience, someone called in to accuse me of having varying levels of skepticism, essentially practicing a certain amount of skepticism for the claims that I believe in, and a different, higher level of skepticism for claims that I don't accept.  This already demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding about skepticism.  It's not about different levels.  But what they accused me of was moving the goalposts.  So what's that mean?  And let's figure out whether or not I was doing it.  So my apologies to anyone living outside the United States who may not fully understand American football, but I'm going to go ahead and go with American football for this example.  It's not that important.  This is all an analogy and you can use the analogy in whatever way you want.  But in American football, it's played on a 100-yard playing field.  And because there's been a lot of games over the years, we have pretty good statistics about how likely someone is, at the professional level, to kick a field goal from a certain number of yards away from the goalpost.  The important point, though, is that the goalpost is stationary.  It doesn't move.  When we evaluate the people's ability to kick a field goal, we take a lot of things into consideration.  Was this done off of a tee?  Once upon a time, they allowed you to prop the football up on a tee, and you could kick longer field goals that way.  The NFL has since removed the ability to use a tee, but it may come up in other games, and we can look at it at the college level, at the high school level,  etc.,  and figure out What's the likelihood from any given distance that someone is going to kick a field goal successfully?  Now, within the NFL, the record for in-game field goals is somewhere between 60 and 70 yards, 63, 64, 65, something like that.  I don't keep up with sports or football all that much, so I don't know what the record is, and it doesn't matter all that much.  The point is that fairly close to the goal, you know, 10, 15, 20 yards, something like that, the percentage that a professional kicker is going to make a field goal is pretty high.  And you have to consider the fact that when we're talking about this in the context of a game, each of the teams has fielded a bunch of players out there who are trying to prevent this.  So not only do you have distance and wind and the physical abilities of the kicker to consider, but you also have to consider the strength of the defensive team, the strength of the offensive team and all that.  But we can put it all together in one little thing and say, here's what's actually happened in a game.  Here are a number of examples of someone kicking a field goal 40 yards, 50 yards, 60 yards, 30 yards, 20 yards.  And what's the likelihood?  And so when we're evaluating how believable it is that a given kicker is going to kick a field goal from a certain distance in a game, we have a lot of statistics to run from.  We know how many times it's been attempted, how many times it's been successful.  We know this particular kicker's skill and abilities.  We know things about the team and therefore we could place a bet from any given distance on whether or not someone's likely to kick that goal.  Now, if we're watching the game and there's a kick from 20, 25 yards, something like that, it's an incredibly high likelihood, you can go look up the statistics yourself, that someone's going to be able to do that.  And so that would be a fairly safe bet.  What happens when you get 50 yards out?  At 50 yards, does it instantly become a coin toss because we're halfway down the field?  No.  Is it a coin toss necessarily at any median point?  Nah, it could be this incredibly nice curve of really high likelihoods of kicking a field goal at close range and vanishingly small ones at a longer range.  In the entire history of the NFL, there's only been 20-some-odd kicks from over 60 yards that made it, if I remember statistics from that.  But the important thing is that the goalposts don't move.  What changes is the nature of the kick.  And so in this analogy, the goalposts should be considered achieving sufficient evidence to reasonably justify a belief.  How likely is it that this claim is going to be true?  How likely is it that this attempted kick is going to actually score a goal?  And the goal is believability.  Now, if you walk out on a field and kick a 75-yard goal, field goal with nobody else on the team, just in a practice, well now you've demonstrated at least that it's possible for human beings to kick a field goal from 75 yards, even though it's never actually happened in a game.  What's that going to do to change the likelihood that someone is going to kick a field goal from 72 yards?  Well, it certainly seems that it's more likely than 75 yards, but considering neither have ever happened in a game, it's incredibly unlikely that in a game scenario this is going to happen.  I gave an example during the phone call of let's say we had right now someone cut my head off, doctors examined me, I was clearly decapitated, we have a reasonable ability to test in the modern era to show that I was in fact decapitated and dead and at some point later we can show that my head's back on and I'm alive.  This came from, in part, a debate I did with Mike Licona on the resurrection, and I like using this example because even the caller on Sunday acknowledged that in that scenario we would not have evidence to confirm how a resurrection took place, but we could at least agree that a resurrection took place.  We would have sufficient evidence to say, yep, this happened, but we may not have any way to show how or why it happened.  Was it some sort of natural phenomenon that we don't know anything about?  Was it a technology that we don't know or understand?  Was it supernatural in origin?  And if it was supernatural in origin, what was the origin of this?  Was it some sort of mystical, magical thing?  Or was it a god?  Was it fairies?  Was it head restoring pixies?  Any of those things.  So the caller understands that this scenario, which I've set up as close to the goalposts as I can, for a resurrection is still something that we can't demonstrate what the explanation is for.  And so I asked, why are you then so confident about a resurrection that comes from anonymous reports in ancient books where we can't investigate, where we have no empirical evidence to sort this out?  And this is where he accused me of moving the goalposts that. ",
