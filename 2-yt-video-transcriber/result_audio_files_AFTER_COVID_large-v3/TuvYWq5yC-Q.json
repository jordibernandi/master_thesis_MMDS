            "text": "You know what?  I've acknowledged your feelings.  I respect your opinion.  We're moving forward.  I'm not, but... It's because I'm not a fake bitch.  I like The Bachelor, but I like The Bachelorette more.  I just love Chris Harrison.  Oh, I like Chris Harrison too.  Oh, you know what would be better?  An Asian bachelor.  Oh, yeah.  That's really diverse.  How about a trans bachelor?  Oh, an Asian trans bachelor.  Oh, yeah.  That's really progressive.  Yes, it is.  It's really good.  Woo!  Hey guys, I'm back with a...

That's what I'm talking about.  That was what I was talking about.  Is it a sativa?  It's just called Truth Bomb.  Truth Bomb Hybrid, you finna get woke.  I don't really know what that means, but we're woke, so it sounds like it's fine.  Hey, you guys, there's a warning on here.  Carly?  You shall.  How is it?  Taxation is theft.  What did you say?  You have to pay taxes.  Otherwise, who would build the roads?  You're right.  Besides, Big Pharma is keeping us sick.  Wait.  What?  It's true.  Try this.  Public schools are indoctrination camps.  Whoa!  This packs a mighty powerful punch.  Wow, that's the strongest little joint I've ever seen.  And they are indoctrination camps.  They are.  Take another hit.  Take another hit.  I gotta see where this goes.  Okay, tiny joint.  Do what you do.  The floor in our water is counseled by our pineal gland.  Oh my god!  That makes so much sense!  That makes so much sense!  That's our third eye!  That's our third eye!  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  The Super Bowl halftime show is a mega occult ritual.  Oh shit, it is.  It's in plain sight.  It's in plain sight.  Give me, give me, give me, give me, give me.  My turn, it's my turn, it's my turn.  My turn.  Circumcision is genital mutilation!  It is, it is.  They just cut your dick tip right off.  They just cut it right off.  And I'm Latino, I should still have mine.  Guys, I have an idea.  What's your idea?  Are you with me?  Oh, oh.  Yeah, you know what I'm talking about.  Do you know?  Do you know?  I do.  But you know, right?  Are you in?  Are you in?  Because you guys know what I'm talking about.  Whip it out.  Poe time!  Whoa!  Whoa!  What is this place?  Where are we?  Are we dreaming?  I don't know.  It's scary, but I like it.  Yeah, it really feels good here.  I got this little tingle in my gut.  Yeah, I got goosebumps, and it feels really good.  It's a little chilly.  I'm a little chilly.  Is the ground moving, you guys?  It feels a little warm to me.  I wish I brought a jacket.  Man, we just have different body temperatures, I guess.  Where is the ground?  Whoa.  What's under us?  We're on something, you guys.  My toes are barely touching the ground.  There's something between my legs, and it's strong.  It feels like a horse's ass.  I'm off the ground completely.  Oh, what's going on, you guys?  We're lifted up.  This also feels really good for some reason.  Oh, what is this?  Whoa, this is... Where are we going next?  Oh, we just... Oh, man, we're going down a rabbit hole.  Oh, man.  We're going down Alice's hole.  Alice in Wonderland.  Lewis Carroll wrote Alice in Wonderland was a pedophile.  He sure was.  Yeah, he was in love with Alice.  Whoa!  There we go, Alice, a pedophile is in love with you.  And she was 12 years old.  Better get away, Alice.  It's a pedo coming for you.  Oh, what is this?  Oh, well, it's obviously a controlled demolition.  See, look, that building's falling at free fall speed.  Well, it does look like it's being demolished.  It's a controlled demolition.  Hmm, another good film by Kubrick.  Filmed in Burbank.  Oh, look, it's that Epstein Island.  The ninth gate to hell.  Oh, hey, look, I think I see Bill Clinton down there.  Hey, Bill.  Look at all the sheep in the pasture.  Yep, another mega ritual.  Oh, that's a young Leonardo DiCaprio.  And the man that molested him.  Leo got pedoed.  Albert Einstein married his cousin.  Cousin fucker.  Theory of relativity, my ass.  Let's get out of here.  Aw, poof, and the fiction is gone.  Dinosaurs never existed.  Oh, that's Stevie Wonder.  He's not flying.  Legalized weed just means it's controlled and regulated by the government.  What?  Whoa!  I can't wait to find out what we see next.  Is there a pattern?  Is there a reason why we're seeing these in the order that we are?  It's never-ending, guys.  Hey, guys, I just want you to know that I'm having a really good time flying around looking at stuff with you.  Yeah, this is like a real bonding experience.  Yeah, it's really cool.  I'm finna woke.  Yeah, I get it.  I'm finna woke as well.  I just, I don't, I'm not buying it.  I don't know about this one.  It's all propaganda.  It doesn't look right.  Yeah.  But this, this one.  Oh.  Yeah.  You know, I think it's, it's possible.  It makes a little more sense.  It's missing something.  Yeah.  It's likely.  Something is missing.  Oh.  No.  That one.  That's it.  This one feels really good.  I can really get behind this one.  On board for this one.  I can feel that in my heart.  Accurate.  That's a truth bomb.  Whoa!  He's not going to eat us, is he?  This is a wild ride.  This is really fun.  Yeah, I'm actually having a great time, Baz.  Yeah, I'm having the time of my life.  You are fake, and I know what you did is up.  And I'm not about that.  The bouncer's back on.  I acknowledge your feelings.  I apologize.  You feel bad.  You're calculated.  I'm real.  You're calculated.  That's the difference between us.  You know, I don't love Chris Harrison.  I only just like him.  I still prefer the Bachelorette format.  I still prefer the Bachelorette format.  What a weird line.  We are stung.  Bomb time. ",
