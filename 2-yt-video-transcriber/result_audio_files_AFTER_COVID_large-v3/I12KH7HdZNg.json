And I started to get stopped by cops that stopped at airports, stopped it.  And I just realized all of a sudden I was much more identifiably, um, A person of color.  I mean, I'm not, you know, I'm pretty light-skinned.  But when I have a huge afro, it's like, oh.  And the whole world was treating me differently.  I cannot tell you how many tickets I got in a five-year span when I grew my hair.  I mean, I never got tickets before.  And I realize this is, you know, for black men in America, this is not news.  But I hadn't been treated that way until that moment.  I had my hair all short and tidy.  And then, like, boom.  And I just thought that just made me realize.  I thought it would be really interesting to write a book about the power of first impressions.  By power, I don't mean how good they are.  I mean how consequential they are.  Outliers came next.  And that was a book because I literally was at a fancy dinner party in Manhattan and sitting next to some rich white guy who grew up, who's, you know, grew up in the Upper East Side in some fancy apartment whose father was an investment banker.  And he was making this argument about how he was a self-made man, that his success was all due to his own hard work and intelligence, which was so self-evidently nonsense that I just thought, you know, let's write a book about how the myth of the self-made man is an illusion, you know, that try to try and puncture that particular myth in American society.  I started meeting all these very successful entrepreneurs who were dyslexic.  And when you ask them about it, they would always say that they thought they were successful, not in spite of their dyslexia, but because of it, which I just thought was such a Fascinating observation.  And David and Gladys is basically an examination of that idea.  How is it possible that something that seems like a disability could prove to be an advantage?  And then my last book, Talking to Strangers, is just about me watching that Sandra Bland video over and over again.  You just opened my car door, so you threatening to drag me out of my own car?  Get out of the car!  And getting angry.  I'd seen the tragedy and the stupidity and the absurdity of a young black woman being pulled out of her car for nothing and then ending up dead in her cell two days later.  Black lives matter.

And then there's the structural conversation, which is, are the systems by which we run our society fair or are they biased?  Those are separate conversations.  And in this country, what we have done is we have used the first conversation, the personal conversation, to get out of our obligations to have the second conversation.  And we've tried to pretend that if we're nice to each other, then all of the other stuff doesn't matter.  And I have the opposite position.  I care less whether white people are nice to black people or vice versa.  To my mind, all that matters is that the society, the fundamental structure of the society be fair.  Voter suppression, redlining, reparations, legacies of Jim Crow, employment opportunity, I could go on.  Whether or not some white person uses the N-word to a black person, I care less.  It's not important.  What matters to me are these Big, serious issues that have a permanent and profound effect on the fortunes of an entire population. ",

And almost as if you were kind of restarting or refreshing a company, right?  That you would kind of have a foundational reset.  Crazy idea, better ways to do it.

You can have all kinds of complicated arguments about police reform, but you start by making sure that your police force reflects the community they are policing.  I wish before we get into some of these more complicated, longer term stuff, let's just go through a concerted period where we just change the composition of people in positions of power.

There's partly it's kids who do really well in their test scores, but there's a huge category of kids who get in because their parents went there or their parents gave a lot of money or they're athletes.  And by athletes, we mean like sailing and fencing and all those other sports which are set up to reward and lacrosse the kids who went to fancy private schools.
