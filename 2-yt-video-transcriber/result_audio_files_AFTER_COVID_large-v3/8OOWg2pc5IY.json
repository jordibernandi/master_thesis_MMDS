            "text": "Dudes Rock is merely an application of the dialect to gender relations.  If you're a man, if you're a man who speaks certain categories, you're a man who is probably white, but not necessarily, probably between the ages of like 25 and 40, probably online a lot and aware of these milieus, basically.  It is a way to signal, although a lot of people are already misusing it, which is inevitable.  That's what happened to Christianity.  It's what happens to all systems.  They get degraded as they lose clarity over transmission through time and space.  It's fine.  But the kernel of Dudes Rock is it is a dialectical, non-toxic masculinity.  It is essentially a way of laundering the toxins out of masculinities.  Like the way that Kevin Costner filters his piss to drink in Waterworld.  Basically, the idea is that toxic masculinity, as it is described in discourse online and is always people phobically afraid of condemning everywhere, is basically an overabundance of negative emotions around the reality of being a man.  And those negative emotions are around the... our sense of insecurity around other men in carrying out manly things and filling the role of, are we manly enough for men?  Are we manly enough to make men think we're men?  Are we manly enough to make women think we're men?  And also at the same time now, because we're in an era of dialogue and we're in an era of always intersecting identities and experiences, now you have this feminism coming along and making you examine.  you're already fraught attempt to perform manly hood and now you're doubly damned.  and that is why you are act.  that's why you act out through toxic behavior because you're trying to reassert that you're a man in the face of your own nagging doubt in the face of other men and also to punish the mouthy women whose presence remind you of your madness remind you that you're the that they're the reason.  women are the reason you have to perform this this this this arduous performance because you are not them dudes rock is yes because of my position in space time because my status as a white male.  in my generation i have been crass.  i have been overly aggressive in asserting my masculinity, I was wrong to do so.  But I don't do that anymore.  And so your categories of men and kill all men, they pass through me.  Like I literally, like not all men, I don't, it doesn't mean anything to me because I don't hold anything to those terms.  I am just a dude who rocks. ",

It's like the principle is there, but it would still have to be refined through time and space or else it would not be Dudes Rock.  Because if he did that exact thing now, it wouldn't be Dudes Rock.  It would be try hard and kind of sad.  By the way, if a 75-year-old David Lee Roth tried to do that, that would be sad and not Dudes Rock. ",
