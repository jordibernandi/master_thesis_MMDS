            "text": "Hello, everybody.  My name is Graham Elwood, and you are watching The Political Vigilante.  So Hillary endorsed Joe Biden, and look at this.  Look at this.  I want to show you what happens while she's talking.  So This is Unbelievable.  And so this was put on Twitter today by Arab Girl for Bernie.  Joe Biden posed during his own town hall and she tagged me and Jimmy and Ron.  But let me tell you something.  Pay very close attention.  I've been saying Hillary is just waiting.  She's just waiting.  This was not a flub.  This is classic Clinton-style manipulation.  They put this out there.  He falls asleep.  She won't say it, but she's going to get everything.  And now the media, because Clinton's going to give the okay... All the media people that she controls, that her and her husband control, that's why she was on Epstein's plane twice.  That's why her husband was on Epstein's plane 26 times.  That's why her and her husband were on Epstein's compound several times because that's part of the control.  This is not a separate, oh, Epstein is separate from... No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  No.  I've talked about this with Whitney Webb.  I just did my video showing... Out of Shadows, and Out of Shadows shows how the CIA has been influencing people, Operation Mockingbird, Operation Paperclip, MKUltra.  Those are all tied together.  And I don't want to seem like I'm going off on some crazy conspiracy.  No, no, no.  It's all part of it.  That's why after the Clintons lost, after she lost in 2016, we weren't talking for three or four years about the Podesta emails and how utterly corrupt her and the Democratic Party were.  That's by design.  We said Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia.  So now what is going to happen?  The corporate media will actually start holding Biden accountable for his clear cognitive decline, the fact that he has dementia.  The thing that Bernie was afraid to bring up, because Bernie kowtows to the Democratic establishment.  He sold us out.  He sold us out.  Is he a deep state operative?  No, but they knew how to play him.  They knew at the end of the day, Bernie won't fight hard.  He won't.  Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  He won't do it.  This is her plan.  I've been saying this.  Watch out.  She's going to suddenly find her way in.  This makes perfect sense.  They went, if we prop up Biden, we hold the media back on calling out his dementia.  Once we get Bernie to drop out and Biden's the guy and Biden's the guy.  then they're going to start calling it out.  And is he, oh my God, he's not good enough.  He's not good enough.  He's not good enough.  Then Hillary, if she hasn't already, is going to lean on Joe's wife.  Joe's wife will either play ball or the Clintons will threaten her.  And eventually she will acquiesce and say, oh, I'm, and Joe will drop out.  And then Hillary's going to rise up and go, oh, I, I just endure.  I mean, do you really want me back again?  Golly gee.  he won't be the nominee she will.  that's what this is.  that's what this was all about. ",
