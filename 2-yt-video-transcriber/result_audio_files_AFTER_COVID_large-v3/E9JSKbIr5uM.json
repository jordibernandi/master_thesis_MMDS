            "text": "Before I can say anything, I just need to give a content warning for the following.  Assault, transphobia, hate crime, gaslighting, and photos of physical harm.  Anna Montgomery is a 20-year-old trans woman from Newtowners who was in Belfast with her boyfriend, Jamie Girvan, when she was assaulted by someone who smashed up her nose and cut her forehead.  Now what's particularly shocking is the fact of where the assault took place.  Anna wasn't assaulted in a dark alley somewhere, or even outside the restaurant as her attacker waited for her to leave the relative safety there.  No.  She was assaulted while she was sitting at the table, in a lit room with dozens of people around her.  That's how bold her attacker was.  The police service of Northern Ireland are investigating what took place, and they are treating this as a transphobic hate crime.  i.e.  a crime in which the culprit was at least partially motivated by the victim's trans status.  Now, an important thing to note about hate crimes is that they're not isolated incidents by their very nature.  A hate crime targets an entire community by declaring that they're not safe in society.  Therefore, the basis upon which hate crime occur is informed by the larger social narrative.  And that's something the couple of papers that have reported on the assault so far have failed to address.  The social context behind Anna being assaulted.  Which is where the current trans hysteria, something brought to the forefront of the public's attention recently with the transphobia displayed by once beloved author J.K.  Rowling, comes into play.  It's no secret that, over the last six years, transphobia in the UK has come to a boiling point.  We are constantly coming under attack by those with large platforms, being painted as a threat to women and children, or portrayed as lost lesbians forced to medically transition.  Even our own government refuses to stand by the majority of the British public who agree with demedicalising legal transition.  Because the sad fact is, bigotry doesn't require a majority to harm the people it targets, it just needs a platform whilst going unchecked.  Now, at the epicentre of much of the discourse surrounding the topic is the idea that trans women are actually mentally ill cis men, or cis men using crossdressing as a way to gain access to and harm cis women and children.  And this is a perspective that JK Rowling seems to share, liking a tweet from sentient trashcan Janice Turner in 2018 that stated quote, No fox has a right to live in a hen house even if he identifies as a hen, on the misogynist thinking which puts a rapist in a women's prison.  This is how JK Rowling, as with many transphobes, sees trans women.  So when Rowling published her latest book, Trouble Blood, a book in which a cross-dressing serial killer gets frills from masturbating in women's underwear and by stealing jewellery from his victims, The message is not the least bit subtle.  Fact is, this is not the first time.  As discussed in a previous video, Rowling's earlier book of the same series, The Silkworm, had the protagonist threaten a trans woman with prison rape, telling her that it quote, \"...won't be fun for you, Pippa.  Not  pre-op.\".  End quote.  This is how Rowling portrays trans people, as mentally disturbed men who are a danger to cis women and can justifiably be threatened with rape.  Now there's nothing new about this.  Indeed, in 1992 there were numerous protests about the transphobic depictions shown in The Silence of the Lambs, the ways in which it fed into transphobic narratives surrounding the trans predator.  How, as Leslie Feinberg put it in 1992, The film turns reality upside down.  It is actually transvestites and transsexuals who have been the victims of Grizzly murders.  end quote.  The difference though is that The Silence of the Lambs was published long before the 2014 trans tipping point, when the trans community and, by extension, trans discourse entered the public eye.  Back then, we were almost a mythical creature, on par with the boogeyman.  We were largely hypothetical, out of mind for most people, save for the occasional article treating us like a one-person freak show.  Now we're far more real, coming out at people's work, their children's schools, and within their social circles.  We're also being discussed in the news daily.  Sadly, a lot of that news uncritically parrots myths surrounding the dangers of trans people, like those forwarded by Rowling in her bigoted manifesto published back in June.  This has changed things in that we are no longer a hypothetical threat.  In the minds of bigots, we've become a tangible one.  We're in every school, every office, every home.  They can no longer brush us off as a fictional monster or freak occurrence.  We're a part of society, one they've been told is inherently dangerous.  Since this is an issue of narratives, let's examine those surrounding Rowling's manifesto, which was a response to criticism Rowling had received for her attack on an article which used inclusive language in its discussion of menstrual health.  Rowling's initial response perpetuates the narrative of inclusivity as violence.  She treats the simple act of acknowledging that trans men and some non-binary people menstruate as this grave violation of women's rights.  In doing so, Rowling unleashed her millions of followers in a tidal wave of abuse, targeting the article and its authors.  Which is ironic, considering that the article was written by three cis women campaigning for menstrual health.  But I guess the abuse of women is feminist, so long as it's for the noble cause of abusing trans people back into the closet.  On their own, these narratives are simple Davo.  Deny the behaviour, attack the individual doing the confronting, and reverse the roles of victim and offender.  What makes her behaviour truly untouchable is how she frames any criticism whatsoever as an act of oppression.  as if she's owed a platform and money and support, and as though people using their freedom of speech to publicly challenge her horrifically destructive behaviour is somehow a violation of her freedom of speech.  All of which culminated in months of her pretending to be the victim of cancel culture, a term which, by this point, has been watered down to mean criticism of people with substantial power.  How in spite of still being a billionaire, in spite of her books still becoming number one bestsellers, apparently people criticising her for the bigoted things she says is cancelling her.  Indeed, when a group of people started the Rest In Peace Rowling hashtag to metaphorically signify that the author was dead to them, bigots began running the story as members of the trans community threatened to murder Rowling.  This darvo is very plain to see once you step back and look at it.  Meanwhile, trans people are suffering real violence.  When this whole thing really kicked off in 2016, anti-trans hate crime rose by a staggering 81%.  Yet this is only the tip of the iceberg.  As reported by the BBC in 2019, the queer charity Stonewall stated that it quote, \"...estimated that two in five trans people had experienced a hate crime or incident in the past  year.\".  End quote.  With Laura Russell, a representative from the charity, adding that quote, These statistics are the real-life consequences of a society where transphobia is everywhere, from the front pages of newspapers to social media and on our streets.  End quote.  Just to be clear, Rowling is not the sole source of all of this hate.  She's merely the latest focal point in a struggle that's been going on for the past several years.  No singular piece, act, or person is responsible for the current state of trans rights in the UK, but it would be unwise to ignore just how central Rowling, as a figure, has become to the transphobic cause.  how they use her vast wealth and platform with over 14 million followers to extend the reach of their violent narrative.  It's a cumulative effect we're witnessing, the result of which are cases like that of Anna Montgomery.  Targeted assaults on people in crowded areas are incredibly rare, with many waiting for the opportune moment to strike, as we saw with Owen Jones, whose assaulter waited for him to leave the pub he was visiting.  But if you've been drip fed this narrative that trans women are an active danger to cis women and children, that they're attacking innocent celebrities and are trying to indoctrinate children into unnecessary medical practices?  Suddenly assaulting them in a lit restaurant not only becomes justifiable in the mind of the assailant, but noble.  They've been emboldened by a constant diet of transphobic narratives, made to feel like their own prejudices are rational.  This is how everyone has had a part to play in violence, like that seen in Anna's case.  By arguing that trans women are a danger to women and children, whether in bathrooms, sports, or prisons, as well as parroting the myth that trans men are naive, vulnerable girls tricked into medically transitioning by some insidious trans conspiracy.  When this is the state of trans discourse, a targeted attack on a trans person cannot be treated as an isolated incident.  This was not some extreme person acting out on their own.  This was someone acting on the ideas that people like JK Rowling have attempted to normalise.  This was so on responding to what they perceived as a threat specifically because of the bigotry that goes unchecked in the UK media.  This is a problem that won't be addressed until we tackle it at its root cause.  Unless we do, we will be seeing a lot more assaults.
