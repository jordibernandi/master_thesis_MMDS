And recently, I've been feeling like they're white liberals in blackface because they're white liberals in blackface.  When I say that, it's because the white liberals, it's all about feminism, LGBT.  White liberals don't really care about black people.  That's correct.  I realize white liberals don't really care about me, bro.  That's correct.  I'm off the plantation, bro.  I'm off the plantation, bro.  I escaped the plantation, bro.  I'm empowered.  They don't want me to have power.  They want to keep me dependent.  But I'm realizing this.  They put white liberal ideas, LGBT, women, non-binary, white feminism, all that Hillary Clinton stuff, put it in blackface.  Because if we say it, it's going to be too crazy. ",

            "text": "I'll tell you what it means.  Nothing about black fathers.  First off, first off, If I can just say, whoo, another one off the plantation.  They got a problem.  And this is how it starts, right?  So this is how it starts.  So what he said in the beginning is really interesting.  He said, originally, I liked Black Lives Matter.  Me too.  Why would I be opposed to that?  Black Lives Matter, right?  Of course they matter.  So you have to understand on the left, they are incredibly good when it comes to linguistics.  They use euphemisms, right?  Planned parenthood.  Of course I want parenthood to be planned.  Oh, by the way, we're actually killing 800 black babies every single day.  So this is what they do.  They manipulate you by using a term that no person in their right mind would be against.  Who would be against Planned Parenthood?  Who would be against Black Lives Mattering?  But the truth is when you do a deep dive and you start to look at the finances, you're exactly right.  People that are in control, Black Lives Matter is a political arm of the Democratic Party.  Call them what they are.  And their idea is to keep black people, as you just mentioned, enslaved and dependent via their emotion and their anger.  So what I would say to you first off is to encourage you to keep going and to keep doing a deep dive, because that's how it started for me, right?  It was one thing that didn't make sense.  It was this constant narrative being shoved down my throat.  But when I deep-dived on these organizations and looked at who was funding them, it never really lined up to the things that would make the black community better.  You mentioned that you realize that they don't promote straight black men, right?  They never talk about the things that matter, black fathers in their home.  That's because they don't want black fathers in the home.  Make no mistake.  Bingo.  So congratulations to you.  Keep digging.  And can somebody at Turning Point USA get his stuff so we can hire him?
