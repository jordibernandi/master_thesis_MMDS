            "text": "On the eve of Valentine's Day, my heart suddenly stopped and I died for a full five minutes.  I'm only here today to share the full story of what happened because my partner, my lover and my hero performed life-saving CPR that brought me back.  This video is the full story.  My heart literally stopped on Valentine's Day.  Two weeks ago, I came home from the gym as I do every day.  I was feeling a little bit off, but nothing major.  I cooked some lunch, a couple of steaks and salad, that's my diet.  My partner's friend was here and joked, that's a heart attack on a plate when she'd seen the two steaks that I was about to chuck on the barbie.  Oblivious to what was about to follow.  By the way, The steaks had nothing to do with my cardiac arrest, so before all you vegans get excited and tell us that soy saves lives, sorry to disappoint.  I just thought that it was kind of a funny fact that she made that comment shortly before I died of essentially a heart attack.  After I ate, I went to lay down for a bit and I asked my partner, Rodna, to wake me up at three o'clock so I can go to work.  I had a cameraman ready who was meeting me in a suburb in Melbourne to do my next story, which hopefully now I'll get to next week.  But the next thing I knew is I woke up in hospital with tubes running out of my mouth and a catheter full of urine.  I know most people want to see if I'm okay, which I am.  I'm on the mend.  The truth is Rhonda is the one that lived through the scariness of what happened, not me.  Today, she's going to share it with us all.  And for obvious reasons, I'm going to hide her face.  I hope you understand. ",

I thought you got up and was getting ready for work.  I went to the bedroom and I opened the door.  And you were laying there and I thought, oh, that's unusual.  You're still, you're asleep.

I was then transferred into the intensive care unit where they began tests on my brain, arteries, and obviously my heart.  They were urgently trying to figure out if I'd needed any emergency surgery to save my life.  It turned out that my arteries were clear and there were no blockages on my heart and thank goodness no surgery was required.  As you can imagine, when I finally woke, I was a little bit disorientated, probably from dying or the medication wearing off and the fact that I had tubes shoved down my throat and a catheter full of urine.

At first, the cardiologist indicated that I would most likely need to have an artificial cardiac pacemaker implanted to ensure that nothing like this ever happens to me again.  Having to undergo that sort of procedure, the idea of it began to send me into a state of fear and depression.  I guess I wasn't sure about what the impact that would have on the rest of my life.  But as the test results returned, it became evident to the doctors and to me that my heart was in perfect nip.  I didn't need a pacemaker.  And in fact, I was in no more risk than the next guy to ever suffering another cardiac arrest.  They told me A statistic that I'd never thought of before, apparently.  The biggest killer of healthy men under the age of 40, I'm 35, is sudden cardiac arrest, just like I had.  The second happens to be suicide, but that's for another time, another video, and there's certainly a lot to say there too.  My cardiologist concluded that based on my last year, this cardiac arrest was likely to be stress-induced and perhaps a new pre-workout supplement that elevated my heart hours before may have been the final nail in the coffin so to speak, no pun intended.  I was then discharged from the hospital on strict conditions of bed rest, no driving for up to six months, No working for a while, no gym at all for a few weeks and then gradually getting back into it.  But certainly no more high caffeine pre-workouts.  My recovery is going great.  I've spent the most of the past two weeks in bed.  I am going a little stir crazy and that's why I'm going to start working slowly, I promise doctors.  Rhonda's taken me out on a couple of excursions to places as exciting as Coles to do the shopping.  But even, to be honest, even that gets tiring at the moment.  The only physical pain I'm currently in is my chest still kills from those compressions, which she keeps telling me is there to remind me that she saved my life.  I'm asking you to bear with me during my recovery period.  over the next couple of months.  And please do continue to support our work financially at tr.news forward slash support.  Because without your generosity now, I don't know how I could survive this to fight another day.  Again, tr.news forward slash support.  When I finally got home from the hospital and we had to have that tough conversation with the children about what happened.  We weren't actually planning on telling the part where I died because it just didn't seem to be age appropriate.  But when my nine-year-old asked, did you die a little bit?  I couldn't lie.  I told him what had happened.  And then he asked something that a lot of adults actually ask me, did you see the light?  And I answered him honestly like I did to all the adults, that I didn't see anything.  He responded, oh, well, that's probably because you went to hell.  That was the first good laugh I enjoyed since this all happened and I'm so grateful for my life and my family.  And when you put the kids to bed when I wasn't there, later that night, what did they say to you? ",
