            "text": "Okay, tribe, the video you're about to watch comes from Aurora, Colorado.  And it's from a communist, Marxist, Antifa member who decides to shoot at a driver, an innocent driver, driving down the road, going from point A to point B, and he has to deal with a mob, a frenzy mob, a Marxist communist blocking the road, okay?  So he decides to drive right through it.  This commie Moses and Tifa decides to shoot at the driver.  Remember that story from Austin, Texas, where that commie, Marxist BLM supporter, all right, walked up to a vehicle with a loaded AK-47?  Well, this individual decides to shoot at the driver.  And what happens is he ends up not shooting at the driver.  He ends up shooting at two other Marxist communist supporter Antifa members who were also there.  So just watch the video.  Shit.  Yo, is everybody okay over there?  Holy shit.  There's a cop that- I mean, excuse me.  Holy shit.  Okay tribe, so now we know of two incidents very similar to each other that happened the last few days, okay?  The one on Austin, Texas and the one on Aurora, Colorado.  But they have some similarities and not the same outcome, but similar situations.  The one in Austin, Texas, let's go over that real quick again.  For a lot of you morons out there that did not get the message the first time, especially those that call themselves libertarian by name only.  The real idea of being a libertarian is the idea, which I have, of I don't care what you do as long as you don't fuck with me.  You know, the idea of don't threat on me.  Remember that?  Don't threat on me, right?  Where's that?  don't threat on me comes from?  I'm going to tell you a little story, a little history story.  Don't threat on me.  That Gaslam flag that the libertarians have taken upon themselves to fly as their own flag.  It is the Marine Corps flag.  Yeah.  It is the Gaston flag, the don't throw it on me flag.  It is a Marine Corps flag.  It was exactly the first battle flag of the Continental Marines.  That's right.  The Gaston family made the don't throw it on me flag, the Gaston flag for the Continental Marines.  the marines put them in their drums.  so um yeah there's there's there's not uh you know idea behind it.  but a lot of you guys don't don't don't get that.  and if you really get the big picture is that the gaston flag is actually a military flag.  you know it's actually a marine corps flag.  oh yeah so yeah that's that's what uncle sam has got the children Very fond of our don't threat on me flag.  We love that.  We love it.  So anyways, going back.  But libertarian, to be a libertarian is to have that idea that, you know, I don't care what you do as long as you don't fuck with me.  Plain and simple.  I don't care what you do as long as you don't fuck with me.  I don't care that you can protest, man.  Just don't fuck my business.  Don't destroy my property.  Don't hurt innocent people.  Don't hold people hostage.  You can do all the things you can do under the Constitution because that's what our Constitution is for.  You can practice your First Amendment.  You can practice your right to bear arms.  Just don't be a tyrant, right?  Don't be a tyrant.  Don't be a tyrant piece of shit.  Right?  So, in Austin, Texas, you got this commie Marxist supporter, BLM supporter, because BLM is funded by Marxism.  How many times do we need to share this with you?  How many times do we need to post the videos of the leadership of BLM stating clearly as day that they are a Marxist organization?  They are a communist, communist print organization.  And their only goal is to destroy capitalism, to destroy the United States of America, to destroy our Constitution.  How many times?  How many times do we need to tell you that?  Right?  So, it is a libertarian's job.  If you're going to be called a libertarian, listen to me clearly.  It is your job, your duty to protect the Constitution.  Yes.  Because the Constitution is what gives us all these amazing human rights, right?  So, and this is our republic.  We're not a democracy.  We are a republic.  OK, folks, so we are here to defend our rights from being taken away by commies and Marxists and fascists.  Right.  So let's say you were KKK supporter.  And you come around my block with that bullshit, I will treat you the same.  I hate fascists, KKK, neo-Nazis, no much different than commies.  They're all the same.  All the same shitheads.  Okay?  So I hate them all.  Equally.  Alright?  Because they're all trying to take away something from me.  That's the real libertarian mentality.  You know?  I don't care what you do.  Just don't fuck with me.  Don't threat on me.  So.  That's the whole idea of being a boogaloo boy.  If you're gonna call yourself a boog boy, a real boog boy, the real original boog boys of the United States of America are the Continental Marines.  Yeah, that's right.  1776, baby.  November 10, 1776.  Hoorah.  Get some.  Get some.  Get some, boy.  I know some of our boys in the other branches of the military are gonna get upset, but that is the truth, man.  You know, the Continental Marines are the original book boys of 1776, okay?  So if you're going to be a real book boy, then actually be a real book boy by defending the Constitution and defending our republic.  That's what you should do.  Not defend communists.  There's nothing book boy about defending Marxists that are blocking the roads from civilians going from point A to point B. There's nothing, nothing, okay, really cool or libertarian by intimidating drivers.  Driving from point A to point B. Now, your false excuse that this driver was driving erratically.  Because that is the shit that's coming from the Marcia's commies that were there.  They're always going to say, I posted videos of this.  Where you got these commies jumping on the vehicle.  They later say, oh, we were attacked.  You know, the vehicle was driving erratically and it hit me.  Oh, really?  It just, you know, you just appear in front of the vehicle, huh?  You just came in front of the vehicle in front of the road and boom, there it is.  The vehicle just came in and wrecked you, right?  That's exactly what happened.  I mean, ugh.  Listen to these idiots, man.  It blows my mind.  So, no, that's not what happened.  I'm driving through the road that is a road that a vehicle drives upon, and you have these mob of assholes trying to take away his right of driving from point A to point B. You got this mob of assholes using intimidation and all kinds of tactics, violence, to take away his right.  He has all the right to drive through that mob.  He has all the right to keep driving to that mob so he can get home safely.  And we have seen videos time and time again where vehicles, individuals in these drivers have stopped their vehicle and they have gotten beat up, killed, looted, their property destroyed.  All because they were trying to be nice.  They were trying to get out of the vehicle and have a discussion with the mob.  They were trying to get out of the vehicle and have a cup of tea with the mob, and it didn't work out so well for them.  The only time that it worked out very well for the driver is the driver kept going right through it, or the driver ended up using his right to bear arms.  His actual right, as it is written in our Second Amendment, To defend yourself against anyone.  Defend your property and life against anyone who tries to threaten or take it away.  That is the real proper use of your right to bear arms.  Branding a rifle and walking up to a vehicle as a threat, as intimidation, asshole, is not part of the Constitution and nowhere in our Constitution does it give you the damn right to do so.  So if you call yourself a libertarian and you think this way, you are an idiot.  Thank you very much.  All right, now go back to Aurora, Colorado.  Similar incident, but happens differently.  The Antifa commie piece of shit, let's call him Pantifa, the Pantifa piece of shit decides to shoot at the driver, okay?  And the driver escapes, but the Pantifa shoots two other Pantifa members there.  So, I mean, it worked out great.  It couldn't have worked out better.  So they are definitely taking care of themselves.  Kind of reminds me of the whole Black Panther little NSAP, whatever they call.  Not fucking around group.  In Louisville, Kentucky.  That shit was funny, man.  They shot themselves.  Shot three people, man.  They shot themselves.  One person shot himself and two other people.  I mean, it's incredible.  I mean, I cannot believe how... Wonderful, that is.  It really does.  It really makes me very happy.  But that's exactly what I'm showing you right now, man.  These idiots have no idea how to use a firearm properly.  And here comes my next point of this message, and I hope you share it because it's very, very important, especially for the Second Amendment community.  Right now, we need to be very aware that the next wave of attacks going to our rights are gonna be gun control.  They're gonna be pushing for gun control.  They're gonna use these situations to push the agenda, the narrative that civilians shouldn't own guns.  And here's my question, man, to the NRA and to all these Second Amendment groups, organizations out there, where the hell have you been?  The last three months, you should have been on the full attack for our rights to bear arms.  You should have been defending the right to bear arms in every single instance.  Not just making videos, not just making memes or whatever, but really do it.  You got great organizations out there.  for the Second Amendment, protecting and defending the Second Amendment, doing a great job, but this is the time.  Because every time you hear about the NRA and other Second Amendment organizations that defend the Second Amendment, the only time you hear about them is when gun control, when there's actual, an agenda of gun control being pushed.  This is the time that we need to ask the President of the United States to sign the National Concealed Carry License.  We need to have the National Concealed Carry License.  We need to have open carry.  I'm for both open carry and concealed.  It's written on our Second Amendment.  We shouldn't have to ask permission for anybody.  But if we're going to ask for anything, during this tenure of our president, Donald Trump, signed an executive order for national concealed carry.  National concealed carry should have been signed two years ago.  Okay, what are we waiting for?  This is the time to give more rights to our citizens to protect themselves against the mob, against communists, against Marxists.  This is the time that we need to fight more for our rights, not to stand back and to watch this shit show and wait for these commies to have more power so they can push gun control.  And that's it, guys.  That is my message.  Hope you guys share it far and wide.  Love you.  Simplify, do or die.  Hoorah. ",
