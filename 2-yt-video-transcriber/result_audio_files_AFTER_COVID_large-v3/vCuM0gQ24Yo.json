            "text": "So ever since you had the U.S.  Capitol, you know, Trump terror attack, you know, there are a lot of people are getting picked up.  Now we are looking at some of the charges they're getting and we don't see them sedition charges.  and we got to keep on applying that pressure about where's those sedition charges for these people.  But one of the responses that has been so far that federal government came by and said, listen, all of them, that were there, they going on a no fly list.  Now the no fly list is basically to protect airlines from terror attacks.  And we have seen what these people are willing to do.  So that is the proper response from the government.  And they said that everybody going on that who was there, into a full investigation.  Now this video came out actually out of the Charlotte airport because the news originally said it came out of DC.  It didn't.  The woman that filmed the video said this actually happened in the Charlotte airport.  You're going to see one of them get pulled off of an airplane and watch how he acts like a petulant child.  Let's go ahead and roll that clip.  Every single one of you, but this is what they do to us.  Sir, why are you crying now?  I mean, you literally acting worse than any child ever seen.  My grandson who's under two, he's going to be two here in a few months.  He doesn't even act like you at all.  See, they thought it was all good going over there doing the bidding of Trump.  You know, Trump not on a no-fly list.  Trump, as you can see, he's still flying around doing what he wanna do, but y'all are going on a no-fly list.  Let me tell you how they're getting you.  Even if they didn't have video of you, do you understand that at the Capitol, they have their own cell phone towers there, so you're gonna connect to it?  and they already got your information.  Now, some of you try to be a genius and try to get rid of your phone.  They still got your information because you signed up for whatever service that you signed up for Verizon, T-Mobile, whatever else you signed up for.  And then every company has to abide by a court order.  So the federal government say, Hey, I need to know who this was.  This is the information they going to give you up bottom line.  So was it really worth it going over there with Trump?  Now you're on a no fly list.  You can't fly anywhere in the United States for sure.  Now you can't fly internationally if you had any kind of trips or whatever.  You're on a no fly list.  You don't know how long you're there.  As of right now, they say it will be indefinite until they completely clear you.  But if you were there, that's how they come to see you is that they got your cell phone information.  Do you realize the only reason they allow us to have the internet the way we do and he cell phones that we have all over the place, you know, all these different cell phones.  when they want to track you, they can, this is the best tracking tool ever that they ever have for anybody.  You understand?  They don't have to be doing what they used to do back in the 50s and 60s to surveil you.  They just look at their cell phone.  The cell phone shows exactly your movements, show your location, who you're calling, who you're texting.  I mean, it's not really a whole lot they got to do at that point.  They really want to start watching you for whatever reason they want to watch you.  So you really thought that you was going to go have the insurrection and then go back home and live your normal life and go back to work.  You really thought it was gonna go down like that?  I mean, I guess, you know, intelligence, you know, really miss a lot of you if you thought that was gonna go down like that.  See, I knew it was gonna go down because, see, Politicians, they don't really move too much when it's people like me and the rest of a lot of people is watching something happens to them by white supremacists.  They may say it's wrong, but they don't do nothing as fast.  But you notice when their life is threatened, oh, people getting arrested like this, people getting on the no-fly list, and more and more is to come.  Nancy Pelosi said any Republican that assisted them with reconnaissance the day before, she want them prosecuted and she gonna see to it.  Oh, they want something done now because their lives are threatened that day after black folks been beating that drum about these white supremacists forever.  But what I'm saying is about this no-fly list, only I can say it sucks to be you because I got some travel vouchers that I still need to use with the airline.  I got to... August to use it.  Yeah, definitely one of them have to August to use it.  So it'd be good to, you know, have you MAGA terrorists, like I said, away from me in the airport because you can't fly.  Like I said, Hey, don't get mad at nobody but yourself.  Take a personal responsibility.  You want to fall on the sword for Donald Trump.  Okay.  And at the end of the day, Donald Trump will fly wherever he want to fly.  As much as people want to say this should happen to Trump, that should happen to Trump.  He's a former president.  They're not going to do nothing to him.  But y'all, Donald Trump not going to do nothing for you?  Nothing.  And that's what you get for not having a mind of your own and getting into this MAGA cult that you guys want to get into.  I don't feel bad for none of you.  Oh well, black folks.  There'll be more space for us on the airline.  But leave me a comment.  Let me know what you think about the situation with this, you know, cry baby crying.  You know, he wanted to be a little terrorist.  So, um, some of the consequences, like I said, we, we, trust me, everybody in the public who don't like, you know, this, this, you know, uh, these magnet terrorists, like I said, we are very happy to have you away from us on airlines.
