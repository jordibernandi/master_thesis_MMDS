The question is almost from a jiu-jitsu perspective too.  What do you do with a guy that's exceptionally good at controlling position, especially on top, very good at wrestling and taking down and controlling position?  Like, let's say so forget maybe striking on the ground?  how do you solve that guy like?  what do you do with your guard if you get taken down?  or do you create an entire system of not getting taken down or escaping?  it's like what.  what ideas do you have for that?

            "text": "well i guess i would say in my mind fighting is a game of trading energy um kind of.  uh you know there's two there's two things there's damage and there's energy.  so like when i say energy i mean like uh tired not tired how much how much gas you've got?  um and then damage counts obviously as well.  um you could be feeling i could be feeling great and then you get to kick me in the head hard really hard three times.  it doesn't matter that i could get up and run a mile i can't get up.  so anyway.  um you know, I think what Khabib does is so well is he makes the fight look like a Khabib Nurmagomedov fight.  Um, he does a great job of avoiding damage on the feet for the most part and really sucking the life out of people with how suffocating and oppressive is his control is.  Um, his chain wrestling is as good as anyone we've ever seen in the UFC.  It's fantastic.  Um, but, uh, That poses a really serious threat for people that need to maintain a certain amount of space and try to hurt them on the feet because unless they're able to inflict an adequate amount of damage, they're going to each time.  Let's say, for instance, let's say him taking them down as a foregone conclusion at some point.  If every single time Khabib takes you down, you get right back up.  It's not that big a deal because it's actually more.  We've all experienced this.  Let's say you and I are rolling.  You tap me 15 times in one round.  Who's more tired?  Probably you are.  Yeah.  My ass so badly that it's like you're the only one working. ",

It's just one of those things that I think like, uh, khabib being the fights taking place in khabib's world in large part and i mean set aside that one giant.  uh what is it right hand that that khabib hit connor with it.  by the way connor reacted like an absolute champion.  he got crushed by that overhand and then drop and his eyes went right back on khabib.  it was immediate positive great response.  so even though that was i think that was a bit of a surprising thing connor reacted really really well.  but if you're going to be on bottom with khabib for four rounds that's going to be tough.  and also connor's a way better grappler than people like to give him credit for but he's not the type of grappler that can do that?  can that can?  that's too tall of an order but there are grapplers that could do that or at least would have a much much better shot at uh being able to weather that type of a storm.
