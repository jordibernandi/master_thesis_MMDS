            "text": "I reject the idea.  I really do.  That's one of the things that bothers me.  And I hear it every day.  I hear it on the media.  I hear it from my opponents.  Bernie is an extremist.  Bernie is too radical.  Okay?  Let's deal with it.  Is raising a starvation minimum wage of $7.25 an hour, which has not been raised in 10 years, to $15 an hour a living wage a radical idea?  No.  is making public colleges and universities tuition-free so that all of our people have the opportunity to get a higher education in a competitive global economy.  Is that a radical idea?  Is doing what every other major country on earth does, guaranteeing health care to all as a right?  I live 50 miles away from the Canadian border.  This is not a communist society up there in Montreal.  They guarantee health care to all.  They spend 50% of what we spend.  Is passing a Medicare for all single payer system a radical idea?  And last point, Donald Trump, I know he's on the network a whole lot.  Donald, you're probably watching.  How are you?  All right.  I know.  Wanted to say hello to the president.  He's actually giving a news conference.  I'm sure he's watching Fox on the side there.  He's kind of addicted to your station.  Trump thinks that climate change is a hoax.  And that's because he doesn't understand or respect science.  I believe that climate change is an existential threat to this planet.  I will listen to the scientists who tell us that we have got to move aggressively to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy.  And through a Green New Deal, by the way, we can create up to 20 million good-paying jobs.  So my point is, I reject... I appreciate Alison raising the question.  I just don't think any of those ideas are radical.  All right, let me ask. ",
