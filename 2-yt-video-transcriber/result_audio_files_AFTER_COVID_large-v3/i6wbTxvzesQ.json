            "text": "It's been interesting, if not predictable, to watch the Australian government go from slow to react to recognising the gravity of the situation to now overreacting.  It isn't surprising, but it's still disappointing, even when you don't expect much from the government to begin with.  Before we get to the meat of the video, let's start with the obvious observation that coronavirus COVID-19 is affecting countries differently.  Italy and Spain have been severely affected, whilst Australia has been relatively lucky.  I don't know why that is.  Perhaps it's due to the virus kicking off during our summer.  Maybe it helps that we're an island nation and impose travel restrictions relatively early.  It's not really important why for the purposes of this video, but as of April 6th, Australia has close to 6,000 confirmed cases with 39 deaths.  Also, we're one of the fastest countries in the world to ramp up testing, having done approximately 300,000 tests, or just under 12,000 tests per million population, which if you exclude from this chart pissant countries with populations under a million, like the Faroe Islands, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malta, Gibraltar, San Marino, and the Isle of Man, we're easily in the top 10 in the world for testing.  As an aside, it's worth remembering when comparing countries that unless they've had extensive testing, a comparison is meaningless.  Thus, pointing to India, which has done relatively little testing, is not a valid comparison to a country like Australia.  Anyway, suffice to say that for now, Australia has been relatively fortunate in avoiding the worst of COVID-19.  Not that I think we should pull back from social distancing efforts, but we could pull back from the encroaching police state clamping down on completely harmless activities. ",

They didn't walk around, obviously wanting to keep their own social distance.  But if people weren't, basically if they weren't exercising, if they were picnicking or sunbaking or napping, they were approached by police, as you can see there, and asked to leave. ",

            "text": "So here's a guy enjoying the sun in a park in Sydney's Rushcutters Bay.  There's no one within 10 metres of him, but we can't have that, said the local constabulary.  Move along.  To be fair, NSW Police Commissioner Michael Fuller admitted to being disappointed with some officers' actions on day one of the new rules, after Sky News captured footage of police driving through Rushcutters Bay Park with their windows down, telling people to stop sunbathing.  Could they have got out of the car and achieved the same thing in a less aggressive way?  Yes, they could, he said.  Is that the sort of policing practices we want to see in New South Wales?  No, it's not.  So the problem here, according to the police commissioner, is that they didn't get out of their car and do it.  Not that they were doing it in the first place, but they did it while seated in a car rather than walking.  Fuller acknowledged there would be days when people felt aggrieved by the way these laws were enforced.  At the same time, they have to be enforceable.  If it can't be policed, then it's not good legislation.  Ah, well, there's your clue, Michael.  It's not good legislation.  But we shouldn't blame the police.  They're just doing their job.  But rightfully, people are confused as to why it is.  they can go and get a haircut or go to a crowded supermarket but can't sit alone on a park bench and eat something they just bought in the crowded supermarket.  At least that's what one man was thinking when he got slapped with a $1,000 fine for eating a kebab on a park bench.  A man has been fined $1,000 after he was caught eating a kebab on a park bench in Newcastle.  The man, 21, was fined on Wednesday after he'd allegedly failed to comply with two previous warnings from the police to do with new social distancing measures.  After giving the man two warnings, officers from Newcastle City Police found the man on Market Street in Newcastle eating a kebab.  on a park bench.  He was then slapped with a $1,000 fine.  Oh well then, that makes all the difference.  He was given two warnings.  There's not a whole lot of detail to this story.  What I'd like to know, was this man standing close to other people when warned?  Was he eating a kebab three inches from somebody else's face?  Or was he just alone on a bench having a meal?  Apparently those pesky details don't matter.  Now, whilst lots of people have found themselves with a lot more free time on their hands, not so the aforementioned New South Wales Police Commissioner Mick Fuller, who's created some busy work for himself, announcing that he is personally reviewing each infringement notice.  He said the rules are in place for 90 days until June 29 and hopefully not longer.  The announcement came after a raft of other fines handed out across New South Wales and Victoria, including police spotting a man and woman sitting in their car in Musselbrook in the New South Wales Hunter Valley on Wednesday.  After conducting inquiries, police found the man 27 and the woman 32. both didn't have a reasonable excuse not to be at home.  Both were handed penalty infringement notices.  Yeah, this is the kind of pin number you don't want.  so two people sitting in a car and thus isolated from everybody else by virtue of being in said car is not okay but two people exercising in the park is okay.  oh and just so you know how much you could be on the hook for by not adhering to these draconian laws.  here are the details for new south wales and victoria.  In New South Wales, you can be fined up to $11,000 or sent to prison for six months for leaving the house without one of 16 prescribed reasonable excuses.  That is the possible outcome if a case goes to court.  Most people would probably rather cop the $1,000 on-the-spot infringement notice.  Victoria's stay-at-home directions set out similar restrictions with fines up to $20,000 but no jail time.  And in Victoria, the order reaches into the private home, explicitly banning people from admitting anyone who doesn't ordinarily live at their residence, with some specific exceptions.  And here are those 16 reasons why you're allowed to leave your own home in our newly formed police state of New South Wales.  work if a person can't work from home, school or an educational institution where there are shitloads of people, shops for food and other essential items where you'll run into shitloads of people, get medical care, exercise but only if the exercise is done alone or with one other person.  Beyond those essential reasons, there are some exceptions listed here.  There are a few I find particularly interesting.  For example, attending a wedding adhering to the five-person limit or a funeral adhering to a 10-person limit.  Now, call me crazy, but I don't think the coronavirus gives a shit about the type of gathering you're attending.  It's not like the virus has a conscience and says, well, they're at a funeral.  I'll give them a miss in their time of mourning.  I'm not saying it's wrong to allow funerals of 10 people, but where's the consistency?  I can be at a funeral of 10 people.  I can exercise in a group of two, but I can't sit in a car in a group of two.  and i can't sit alone on a park bench and eat a kebab.  as for the weddings rule this provides men with a fantastic opportunity to escape that anachronistic institution of voluntary servitude.  look honey i wouldn't want to spoil your special day.  i know how important it is to you for all your friends to see you in a white dress while i stand there like a spare prick.  maybe we should postpone forever going to a place of worship or to provide pastoral care.  Again, while some religious people might like to think their version of magical sky daddy is going to protect them, they're wrong.  This is an empirical question, and we can answer it empirically when we have the data.  Faith doesn't enter into it.  Now, there's a plausible argument to say this is an important community practice for some and beneficial for their mental well-being.  Fair enough.  I have no problem with that, nor do I want to ban religious gatherings.  But again, The point is, where's the consistency?  Now, as the Sydney Morning Herald reported, governments have not covered themselves in glory when it comes to the details.  Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews has been especially bolshie in instructing citizens to stay home at all costs, including his dictum on Wednesday that lovers who don't live together should not visit each other.  But later that day, the state's chief medical officer, Brett Sutton, reversed course, tweeting, We have no desire to penalize individuals who are staying with or meeting partners if they don't usually reside together.  We will be making an exemption.  Meanwhile, in New South Wales, government advisers were telling journalists that visiting your partner was not technically allowed under the public health law, but was unlikely to be policed in any serious way.  Then at a press conference on Wednesday, Fuller said it was absolutely fine to visit your partner because it involved giving care to another person and was part of preserving good mental health.  So there's a good euphemism for a shag.  Where are you going?  I'm off to my girlfriend's place to provide care and preserve good mental health.  Know what I mean?  Know what I mean?  Nudge nudge.  Know what I mean?  Say no more.  Now, remember, one of the valid reasons for leaving home was to go to school or other educational institution.  And whilst teaching someone to drive doesn't quite fall under that definition, you'd think the authorities might look the other way.  Oh, don't be so naive, Scott.  Teenage learner driver fined $1,600 for driving with her mom during COVID-19 lockdown.  A 17-year-old learner driver was left shocked after being fined more than $1,600 for driving with her mom during the COVID-19 lockdown.  Cherie Reynolds was supervising her daughter Hunter as she drove from their Hampton home to Frankston at the weekend when the pair were pulled over by police and fined for non-essential travel.  We didn't think for one minute that we would be doing anything wrong.  We weren't in contact with any person.  We weren't stopping anywhere, Cherie told 3AW's Neil Mitchell.  She, the police officer, said we were too far from home and we would cop a fine.  and that Hunter would be the person to receive that fine.  When the mother and daughter questioned the fine, Cherie said the police officer told her police were smashing it on the roads today.  Now remember, we shouldn't be too hard on the police.  They're just doing their job.  And it's not their fault that the intelligence test to get into the police force is passable by most sixth graders.  Remember, these highly trained professionals undergo specialized instruction in order to communicate with the general public using sophisticated language.  such as the police are smashing it on the roads today.  And if you're thinking this can't be true, here's a copy of the infringement notice from the Victorian police.  The Gold Coast is now closing its beaches to non-locals.  Basically, that means people from Brisbane driving down on the weekend.  How are they going to enforce that?  Gold Coast Mayor Tom Tate didn't say because he doesn't know yet.  We are working through the finer details to have parking officers redeployed to monitor illegal parking.  I didn't want to do this, but what happened over the weekend shows me especially people visiting from Brisbane are not listening to us.  Councillor Tait said he'd been speaking to the police and was told a lot of people that had been pulled over in cars had said they were going to the beach.  He said this was non-essential travel.  Now, I have a question.  If you're going to the beach and intend to swim, use a boogie board or better still surf, that is exercise, isn't it?  And if you're going in a small family group of people that live in the same household and you don't come within 1.5 metres of other people, isn't that OK?  I went to a local beach on Friday.  There's a sealed concrete path to walk on just behind the beach, which I do for about four kilometers.  Then I turn around and walk back.  But when I walk back, I walk along the beach, take my shoes off, dip my toes in the water.  Is that okay?  The beach I go to is about six kilometers in length and I encountered about 30 people and a couple of dogs in a four kilometer stretch.  So plenty of social distance between people.  Personally, I wouldn't go to a crowded beach, and I remarked in my previous video about the complacency of some people that are doing that.  I'm trying to exercise some common sense, and I wish the police would do the same.  Yeah, some people appear incapable of exercising common sense, but the examples I've given make the police look like they're no better.  Or I guess we could go the route of the WA police, who have unveiled new drones that will patrol public gatherings to make sure people are observing social distancing.  This is a public service announcement from... everyone in the surrounding area to ensure they are social distancing.  Socials are saving lives.  For further information around social distancing, please visit www.wa.gov.au.  Everyone in the surrounding area to ensure they are social distancing.  Please ensure you are 1.5 metres away from others.  Thank you.  Your actions are saving lives.  And now we've learned that the government has got its hands on mobile phone location data to track the movements of Australians.  Now it should be said that they're not tracking the movements of specific individuals.  Vodafone had provided the government on request with aggregate data that shows the total number of subscribers in various areas at points in time.  This information can help show trends in population movements immediately before and after the lockdown measures with the aim of assisting in the reduction of the spread of COVID-19.  And here is some of that data.  Vodafone's Director of Corporate Affairs, Dan Lloyd, assured us that no personal information has been provided and no personal information could be derived from it.  So individuals aren't being tracked, but this is the type of thing that gives governments bad ideas.  What, you mean?  we can track what people are doing, monitor their every movement like a virtual ankle bracelet?  Shit yeah, let's do more of that.  Whilst we're told that these measures are temporary, and I'm sure most of them will be, we have to be vigilant in demanding that the state walk these measures back when the crisis has passed.  If you have any stories of state overreach related to COVID-19, not conspiracy theories, then leave them along with your thoughts in the comments below.  I'll see you next time. ",
