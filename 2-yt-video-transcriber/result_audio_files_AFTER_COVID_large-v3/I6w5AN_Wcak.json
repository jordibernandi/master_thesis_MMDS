People get up to a certain level.  and one of the things that's going on in my opinion with Joe Rogan is that when Joe Rogan starts to talk about his misgivings about Joe Biden in a way that you find at any bar in America about cognitive decline in a 77-year-old who's about to be 78, I believe in November, We have never had anything remotely as insane as a 78-year-old person slated to win the White House.

In order to know whether or not you are currently destroying American citizens as we did in the past and as we have documented, as we found out in 1976, the federal government destroyed Americans who had political beliefs that the government didn't want to continue.  And I don't know whether you are grasping that.  One interpretation of why Jon Stewart and why Joe Rogan and why Bill Maher and all these people to some extent hide behind, it's a joke.

And most of the people who derided me have said, wow, did I not get things?  It's like if you started to propose, you wanted to do The Sopranos in the era of 30-minute sitcoms.  It's like, you don't get it, man.  The American people, they're not interested in these long plot storylines.  That's your weird thing?  Nobody cares, dude.  Everybody just wants short, fast, memorable.  And like, okay, so if you do that, you totally miss the opportunity.  And the savvy people used to say, Kid, let me tell you, nobody ever lost a dime underestimating the intelligence of the American people.  Well, that was totally wrong because they didn't calculate opportunity costs.  I have been talking about the problem of Joe for a long time.

It's easier for me to believe that that's happening when it's happening around Joe himself.  But I'm worried about my friend.
