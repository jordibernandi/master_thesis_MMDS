            "text": "All right folks, pay attention.  Listen, you want to get out some newspapers and some sharpies and write this down no matter what.  Here's what I would do if I were a salesperson making a living selling a product or service.  Now I say that in jest because I am a salesperson and I am making a living selling products and services.  Eight figures a year currently, almost nine.  If you guys don't know how to count, that's a hundred million plus.  If you're a nine-figure company, you're making $100 million annually.  So if you want to make more than $100 million per annum, you're going to want to definitely write this shit down.  Because if I could go back at 21 years old, 18 years old, when I started selling, when I started really kind of getting into it and not really understanding, I wrote down some things before the thing.  I'm like Joe Biden now.  so I wrote down what I would do differently if I could start it all over.  what would I want to know?  and I'm gonna tell you guys that and you guys may already know it and maybe you don't.  but if you do know it and you're not applying it well then you're dumber than a box of rocks.  first thing I'd want myself to know at that young age is the more hands you shake the more money you make.  you guys realize that right.  everybody here can double their income without closer school just by doing more than you're doing today talking to more people, shaking more hands, introducing yourself, networking more, going to more events.  Instead of staying home, you're out networking, you're out hand gladden, you're out shaking hands, pressing palms, upping the numbers, right?  I wish I knew that back in the day.  You know what else I would have liked to have known back in the day?  To take shit more seriously.  For years, I just bebopped around like a dipshit.  right didn't pay attention didn't practice didn't implement didn't use every opportunity to get better because you guys are blessed with opportunities.  if you're selling something right now and you have a customer that's an opportunity and that opportunity is not just to make a commission.  it's to build a relationship which is what you should be doing first.  secondly it's an opportunity to practice and hone your craft to become a master at what you're doing.  And if you become a master at what you're doing, you're going to be successful financially anyway, no matter what.  But you have to be a master at what you're doing.  Name somebody that's badass to the level of master, like Bruce Lee, right?  To the level of the best in the world at your craft.  who's broke?  that's the best in the world.  who do you know?  anybody?  i bet you can't name anybody.  i bet maybe if i thought about it like the best homeless person in the world autonomous maybe the new president of chas?  the autonomous you know.  but i'm talking about sales.  i'd take it more seriously.  i'd use every opportunity to get better.  i'd appreciate and have the gratitude that i didn't have.  it took me a lot longer to move up advance make money all that i could have a rolodex right now worth extreme amounts of money.  there could be uh daughters in the back seat.  sorry about that.  i said duckers.  by the way you guys realize if you have a little kid and you accidentally slip and say a bad word just say a word that rhymes with it really quick and their mind remembers the last word you said.  so if you say the f word no matter how loud you say it and then be like a duck they just remember duck.  so anyway i would take it more seriously and realize that man there's a lot of opportunity.  every second of every day in a sales situation is an opportunity to get better.  practice your craft make a relationship more importantly and turn that individual into a friend.  because dude if you can make that individual an actual friend You're going to sell them not only what they came to buy, more than likely, because half of you are just order takers standing around fucking taking an order.  I would have took things more seriously and appreciated every opportunity and got better quicker.  Number three, I wish someone would have told me to start a company.  How many people on this episode have a company?  If you don't have a company, you're like, well, I work for so-and-so.  I don't care.  Go start a company.  Start your own company.  Start a company.  Tomorrow, go down.  business office.  start a company.  it's three four hundred bucks maybe depending on where you go.  you can go online.  there's corporation corporations that'll set it up for you.  you don't have to know shit.  just pay the money.  come up with a cool name.  Now, why would I start a company?  Well, dude, the tax advantages of starting a company are ridiculous.  All the money I spent dry cleaning, I could have ran that through my company.  Why?  Because my company leases out fucking rock star sales talent, and they have to look good.  All the money I spent on books or training, I could have freaking thrown off.  So you can write off a lot of investments when you have a business.  I wish someone would have told me that, especially in sales.  Lack of fear.  Write that down.  I wish someone would have told me to stop being afraid of the dumbest shit.  A lot of you guys are going to spend a lot of time afraid of customers, afraid of, you know, making calls.  You're going to anticipate negativity when you approach a door.  You know, oh, they're at dinner.  I bet you they are not going to appreciate my knock.  You're going to self-talk yourself right out of a couple hundred thousand a year minimum.  The reason is fear.  You're going to fear the dumbest things.  Fear what people think.  Fear rejection.  So what if somebody says no?  What are you so worried about?  Like, dude, everybody's not going to buy your shit.  The question is, is to find enough people as fast as you can that do want to buy your shit.  That need your shit.  That want your shit.  By the way, if there's any employees that were forced to be here, this is closer school raw.  You're looking for the PG edition.  So I keep forgetting, dude.  There was a daughter in the back of Gilkey's car.  Gilkey's car.  No shit.  Anyway, pit, pit, pit, damn pit.  Anyway, no more customers.  All right.  The lack of fear is what I wish someone would have told me to have.  You shouldn't fear anything.  Zero.  Don't fear getting fired.  Don't fear upping a customer.  I say upping a customer because that's what we used to call them.  You know, a customer was an up.  You got to go talk to that up.  And they called it an up because it was an acronym for unattended person.  But ultimately, a lot of people would have fear.  When I sold Bill Gates a car, Nobody wanted to up the guy.  They didn't know who he was.  I didn't know who he was.  Guess what?  I don't care.  I'm going to go talk to anybody because I would have recognized that talking to somebody is an opportunity to do business.  Even if they don't buy, a lot of times I'd get referrals from the people I didn't sell anything to.  But more importantly, I built relationships, ended up getting free concert tickets, ended up freaking doing all kinds of cool shit.  just because I built the relationship first and Then when that individual was ready to come back, guess who they knew like and trusted?  Me.  Guess what all the other salesmen left an impression on him?  This guy just wants a commission.  So again, I wish someone would have told me that.  Another one, grow thick skin.  That's part of lack of fear.  Dude, just don't worry about stupid shit.  Just grow thick skin.  Doesn't matter what people say.  Doesn't matter what people think.  Who cares?  Knock the door down.  I always say you knock on that door long enough, dude, guess what?  That sumbitch is coming down.  Grow thick skin.  Don't let anything bother you.  I wish somebody would have told me that follow up is critical.  Can't tell you how many times I didn't follow up professionally or correctly or even at all.  If everybody on this call right now just made a vow to follow up now on, follow up relentlessly.  And by the way, with a thick skin, with a lack of fear, with no negative self-talk, talking yourself out of it.  Jeez, I've already called him seven times.  I bet he's trying to get rid of me.  Boy, he's not answering my call.  I guess he doesn't want to talk to me anymore.  Why is he ghosting me?  Then you start to get that negative, and then when you finally get a hold of him, you almost sound like you caught his ass, which makes you sound all awkward.  Muir finally answers the phone.  Hello?  I'm like, dude, you been avoiding my call?  Instant frickin' awkwardness.  So at the end of the day, man, you wanna follow up, I wish someone would've told me that.  Follow up's critical.  Okay, mindset is key.  I can't tell you how many times I woke up hungover, I woke up pissed, things weren't sitting well, I had issues at home.  Night before, my girl threw my golf clubs out the top floor into the pool.  This is a true story.  One time I was married, I get home, I open up front door I see the sliding slap blinds open.  you can see my pool in the backyard and I hear somebody screaming and I see my golf clubs drop into the pool and then my shotgun and then my printer.  my wife was upstairs just madder than hell throwing all my shit in the pool Or I should say ex-wife.  So you guys got to leave your problems at the door, you know, even starting tomorrow.  COVID, divorce, doesn't matter.  Whatever your problems are, leave them at the door.  You got to get your mind right.  When you get in the game, you got to be prepared and act like you're going into a cage and you're about to fight a dude.  You ever stand outside of a cage looking at some dude waiting for you to get in there to fucking throw down?  Dude, your heart's all pumping.  People are like, oh, I didn't know.  you fought, Brad.  I haven't.  I just imagined it.  You know, your heart's racing.  I'm not thinking, you know, last night it wasn't very nice when you said something bad about me.  I'd be like focused, adrenaline pumping, focused on what's about to go down.  And I'd walk in that ring and I'd freaking swing three ways, fast, hard, and consecutively.  Now either I'm going down or that dude is.  Somebody's going down.  And if I got my ass kicked, I'd leave the ring, heel up, and head back in with the same focus and enthusiasm.  So that's every single day when you approach sales.  Now ask yourself, are you approaching sales that way?  Because I'll bet you the answer is no.  Not really.  You're kind of half-assing it, aren't you?  Tell the truth.  You're a half-ass.  So wake yourself up, man.  This is what I wish someone would have told me.  Because, dude, I was half-assing it most of the time.  Even though I kicked everyone's ass, doesn't mean I couldn't have doubled and tripled what I did.  I was still a lazy dick.  knicker knickerbocker.  so sorry yeah i gotta get a different word in there.  it's got a right it's got a ride.  it's got a ride.  sorry about that again i know but she's in the back probably thinking holy moly.  Here's another one I wish someone would have told me.  Practice.  Yeah, I didn't practice.  I practiced on real customers and it cost me a fortune.  Dude, practice on your friends.  Tell people you just want to practice on them.  Role play with me.  Tell me no.  Try to act like you don't want to buy something.  They're the worst critics anyway.  If you can close them, and you can if you do the techniques, you get them to move from a no to a yes, they start to say, I'll probably buy from you.  You're like, dude, you're supposed to be doing it, you know.  Like you're not a buyer, but I'd practice even your rebuttals, even your objections.  If you don't have like five rebuttals to every single possible objection you have, you know, then you're not really that prepared, are you?  Have you written down all of the objections that one gets?  If I said, Sean Grover, name the top five objections.  If you can't go bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, that means you're not studying the craft.  You're not practicing as much as you should be.  And you're not really taking it seriously.  Like you're violating a lot of these things.  That's what I did.  Nobody told me this.  Like if I would have treated it like a freaking college, like dude, people go to college and get out and work 60 grand.  You go to college in the first four to five years of a sales career, you can make a million dollars a year.  No problem.  Like it's the best time to get better is when you're learning this stuff, practicing this stuff, knowing to write down stats.  What is the number one objection I get?  What is five rebuttals that I can... instantly spit out in three different ways in two different languages.  that's when you're freaking a pro and by the way that's when you're going to be making a ton of money and you probably wouldn't be on this call because you'd think you'd know it all.  and you might.  because again i mean like.  i'm not on calls trying to figure out how to become a better salesperson.  i'm on calls trying to figure out how to freaking write better copy market get more leads because i'll close damn near anybody.  I want to know things.  I'm on calls, but I can promise you this.  If I would have been 21 and would have listened, because I wouldn't have listened.  Somebody would have said, Brad, practice what you're talking about.  I would have said, oh, that's stupid, dude.  How embarrassing.  Like I'm going to practice.  That's foolish.  But if I would have practiced, I would have got better quicker.  So I'd be doing that.  And then I'd also leverage other people, man.  I didn't leverage enough people.  You guys realize you can get a virtual assistant online for 1500 bucks a month.  If you guys got 1500 bucks a month left over and you know how to leverage somebody else, you can double your income just by having a virtual assistant prospect for you.  Go find all the leads for you.  You could tell a virtual assistant right now, hey, I want the names and phone numbers and email of the 50 top CEOs of the target companies that I would love to sell.  Now you go do that while you continue doing whatever it is you do.  That virtual assistant will go do the work to literally get those phone numbers, get those emails.  She'll make the three hours of calls to get past the gatekeeper, you know, incentivize her even more than her normal pay.  You incentivize that, you're spending 1500 bucks.  You know how much 1500 bucks will get you?  40 hours a week.  40 hours a week, dude.  That's like a complete another job.  So $1,500 gets you somebody working 40 hours a week for you.  What can they be doing for 40 hours a week that can make you money?  Prospecting, research, white papers, customer service, calling all your past customers, asking for referrals.  See what Ingram's thinking?  Damn, dude, this is a serious freaking... episode.  he ain't cracked one freaking joke.  you know why?  because he knows i ain't lying dog.  this is this is gold man.  this is gold.  this is the shit you wish you were doing.  if you look back 20 years from now you'll be like i should have been doing this dustin miller.  be like dude.  if you start doing it right now 20 years from now you'll be way farther ahead than if you don't do it.  see what i'm saying.  there's going to be people that literally don't listen to what i'm saying.  maybe they don't understand it.  they're too afraid to speak up ask questions put something in the chat which by the way violates these.  Okay?  Lack of fear.  That's what I mean.  Like, you guys need a lack of fear.  You can't be afraid to say, now, what do you mean, Brad?  Well, dude, if I ask what he means, everyone in the room is going to make fun of me.  Who cares?  Like, dude, I don't really care.  Did you guys see my stories when I was on the boat and I'm driving back?  A couple people would be like, dude, I can't believe you put that up there.  I'm like, why?  He says, because your boobs were bouncing on the way.  I'm like, number one, bitch, I ain't got boobs.  And then I said, yeah, but dude, it's the COVID-19.  Everyone gained about 19 pounds.  I said, but I don't care.  What do I care?  But then I thought about it.  I looked.  It had like 9,000 views.  I'm thinking, well, too late now.  But anyway, it's just a lack of fear I've developed.  What's the worst that can happen?  What's the worst that can happen?  so i'd leverage other people's time.  write that down like a virtual assistant like a friend a spouse.  maybe your wife or husband doesn't work freaking.  hire them.  have them do some work man have them.  prepare you somehow.  leverage people's time.  i wish i would have known that.  here's how i would have doubled my income like if i was 21 and i could go whisper in the dude's ear hey you want to double your income this month.  my answer would have been hell yeah but i wouldn't have known how.  here's how i'd do the numbers.  figure out the numbers and make a plan.  then i'd work the plan.  so it's like how much do you want to make?  first of all write down any number you want up top.  okay i'm going to write down i want to make 50 000 shmolians a month.  this is what i want to make 50 000 shmolians a month.  600k a year.  that's my goal.  that's what i want to do.  What is the average commission I earn when I sell my product or service?  Just the average.  Let's say it's a thousand to make math easy.  Thousand dollars.  That's my average commission on a deal.  Well, that tells me if I want to make $50,000, I have to sell 50 deals this month.  So now I keep doing the numbers.  Okay, in order to sell 50 deals, what's my closing percentage currently?  How many people do I need to speak to to get an appointment or to present the opportunity?  And then out of all those opportunities, on average, what do I sell?  If you don't know those numbers, again, folks, you're an amateur at best.  Or you're new, and that's why I'm telling you.  Because, dude, we've got to be reminded of this.  I didn't do this for years.  Then when I finally figured it out, it allows you to do the numbers and freaking make an exact plan of what you need to do and then work the plan. ",
