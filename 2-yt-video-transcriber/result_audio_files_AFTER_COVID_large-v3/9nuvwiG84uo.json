Gun ownership is cherished, and it makes our little town safer.  As a young woman working late nights at a restaurant, I learned real fast how important it is to defend myself.  After a violent incident outside my business, I took advantage of Colorado's open carry laws and began to carry at work.  My waitresses asked if they could open carry too.  And now Shooter's Grill has mandatory firearm training and target practice available for my staff, most of whom are young women.  Educated law-abiding gun owners are the safest people in America to be around.  So when anyone comes in to limit the rights and safety of my family, I'll tell them exactly what this mom thinks.  I am here to say, hell no, you're not.  I have four children.  I'm 5'0\", 100 pounds.  Cannot really defend myself with a fist.  All you're going to do is restrict law-abiding citizens like myself.  So this is why I choose to defend myself and my family.  Not only is it my right, but it's a right I was sent here to protect from rightful Colorado.

In this restaurant, like everybody, as she mentioned, she allows them to take guns into the restaurant.  And then here's something that happened.  In September 2019, this is a part of the video, Beto O'Rourke was at an Aurora Town Hall meeting during the 2020 presidential campaign over his proposal for the gun buyback program.  It is a very important issue in Aurora, as you may know.  And she got up and said, hell no, you won't take our guns.  And that kind of began her career as being this advocate.  I mean, she's like the new Dana Lash for the NRA, which is an interesting take on this too, because NRA is being investigated right now and is going to be dismantled likely.
