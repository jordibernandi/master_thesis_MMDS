I feel like this one is going to be research heavy for me in some spots, so it might actually have been easier for me to find a more practiced creationist to respond to.  But what I'm going for here is kind of a case in point.  We're used to seeing creationists like Answers in Genesis or the Institute for Creation Research or Creation Ministries International, big organizations with big budgets that usually have some highly qualified people on their side, making sure that the basic mistakes that creationists are prone to are well hidden to the casual observer.  But this video is, in my opinion, an example of the results of such tactics.  These organizations result in creationists who sincerely believe and think they know what they are talking about, but have ended up being completely mistaken on many very basic points.  So let's go.

How is time inside Jesus?  Is it only in Jesus if you're a Christian and not for non-Christians?  Is that an evolution of the Latin Anno Domini, which translates to in the year of the Lord, referring to how many years it's been since the birth of Jesus?  And fun fact, I know there are apologists out there that make a big deal about how our whole calendar system is based on the birth of Christ.  It's not, but the year counting is, at least in Western cultures.  But with such an important date as the birth of God himself, we actually now know that we were off by at least four years.  And even then, that's based on the death of King Herod, but the events surrounding Jesus' birth seem to be completely made up.  The two accounts of his birth in the Bible don't even corroborate each other's stories.  The only details they agree on are that his actual birth was in Bethlehem, and at some point after he was born, the family moved to Nazareth.  After a few years in Matthew, and after a couple months in Luke.  For a more detailed comparison, I did a read-through and comparison of the two Christmas stories a couple years ago.  It's not my best work, but I do point out several inconsistencies between the two stories. ",

This is an observable fact that happens and is so undeniable that creationists, when presented with this definition, will usually accept it but appeal to it being microevolution rather than macroevolution.  But because the scientific side of the debate has changed its position on a number of occasions when presented with new information, the creationists like to spin that as scientists being uncertain and flitting from one explanation to another depending on what seems most convenient at the time.  While the Bible is the firm rock that is reliable and doesn't change, when the reality is that scientists are simply willing to change their opinions and worldviews when presented with new information, while creationists remain stubborn in their opposition despite all the evidence to the contrary.

            "text": "That rant was all about transitional forms.  Now, of course, he's thinking of big transitions like the move from water to land or the development of flight.  But these major environment transitions are actually in the minority, and there are only a handful of major environments that would require these major transitions.  The way I look at it, there are three aquatic, terrestrial and avian.  Since life began in water, we would only expect to find transitions from water to land and from land to air.  And since we have quite a number of not only fossil examples of these transitions, but living animals, too, I'd say that those transitions are more than adequately represented.  Hell, we even have transitions back from terrestrial into the water.  Powered flight has evolved at least four times in birds, pterosaurs, insects and bats.  It possibly evolved three times in pair avian dinosaurs.  That is, the theropods that are closely related to birds but weren't actually birds.  It was a large diverse group of small feathered theropods, several of which had gliding capabilities, so this group was absolutely ripe for the development of powered flight.  These major transitions are well represented in the fossil record, and we have several species of fish that have evolved various methods for surviving, at least temporarily, on land.  Walking catfish will leave their ponds in search of new ponds when they start to dry up.  Mudskippers wallow in mud.  Bashirs have been raised completely terrestrially, and the ones raised on land were significantly better at moving around on the land than their aquatic counterparts.  Several fish whose natural habitat is in stagnant water have an organ called a labyrinth organ.  It allows them to breathe in air in a similar fashion as a lung would.  Several species of animal have developed gliding as a transportation mechanism, and gliding is a likely precursor to powered flight.  Transitions are everywhere, and this is just from the three major environment categories that I've mentioned.  If you want to get into transitioning between the environments within these categories, there are even more. ",

Humans are unique in that we have the joint to make hanging out possible, but we generally prefer not to use it that way.

And I'd say that most people who do accept evolution don't have a problem believing that the character of Jesus was based on a real guy.  The problem comes with believing the many impossible things that are attributed to him, not the least of which are the contradictory accounts of his birth that I've already touched on.  So did Jesus leave Bethlehem before he was two months old, as it says in the book of Luke, or after he was two years old, as it says in the book of Matthew?  And did he stop in Egypt for a few years first or just go straight on to Nazareth?  If the story of his birth is so full of holes, why should I believe any of the miraculous stories that are attributed to him in these same books that are supposed to document his life?  Will he use an example of evolution that isn't based on his ignorance of the theory?  Will he realize that a joint that is prone to failure is not a perfect design?  To find out, tune in tomorrow.  Same Rhino time, same Rhino channel. ",
