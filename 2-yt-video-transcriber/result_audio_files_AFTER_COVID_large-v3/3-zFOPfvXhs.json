            "text": "Good to meet you.  So what were you doing over at the bus stop?  I was taking pictures of the route on the signs.  Yeah.  Then I took pictures of the flags.  Okay.  And walked around and took pictures of the signs, like for handicapped parking.  Then I walked up to the lobby and took pictures of the door.  Yeah.  And then I took pictures of that art exhibit of that bike thing for the public on the public sidewalk to walk up to.  So did they tell you to leave the property?  This is against their policy.  And I said, well, I'm not going past your gates.  And the only reason I talked to him was he called me over there.  So I talked to him and asked him.  No, I didn't go past his gates.  Everywhere public here on the sidewalks, the flags, the part where you get on the bus and where the public parks get on the bus is all second picture.  So I don't know what their issue is with it because it's public property.  Uh-huh.  It's a business.  It's public.  It's public property.  It's business.  So if you're on their property and you're not there to take the bus or have business with them, and they ask you to leave, you gotta leave.  This is public property.  I can walk all up and down this and take pictures of this place.  So, I'm telling you to stay off their property.  I'm not going over into that.  Okay.  I'm just telling you.  Yeah, okay.  They don't want you on their property.  I didn't go over there, and I didn't go over there.  Now, I can go catch the bus.  Let me talk.  Okay.  We'll get a call here, and you're on their property.  Yeah.  We're taking you to jail because you've been warned.  This is your warning.  His supervisor even said, well, as long as she's out there on the sidewalk, she's fine.  So I don't know what they're, I'm not going on the property.  Okay, no problem.  Yeah, I didn't go and I'm not going to.  I don't want to.  I'm not going to get a fee.  Why not?  You're supposed to have ID on you.  What?  I'm not driving a car.  You got to have some form of ID on you.  No.  To identify yourself.  No.  No?  But why would I give you ID for taking pictures in public?  They said you were trespassing.  I didn't go.  That's why we're out here.  I didn't go over there, though.  Ask them.  They'll tell you I didn't go up there.  They said you were on the property.  I was on the public sidewalk.  What's your name?  I'm not going to give that information.  What's your name?  I have no reason to give you that information.  We're here because you were trespassing.  So if you can't identify yourself, we'll take you to jail.  That would be a shame.  I haven't gone on the property.  I'm asking you simply for ID.  But I haven't broken a law.  I didn't break the law, and I'm not driving a car.  I'm taking pictures in public.  What's your name?  I'm sorry, I don't want to get the information out.  Why not?  I have no reason to.  I haven't done anything wrong.  If I've broken a law... You, uh... See if they can go get the video camera footage and see if she was on their property.  And if so, we'll detain you and figure out who you are.  Okay.  Okay, I never did go on the property.  I've been on this public area.  Ask the guy.  I know.  I asked him.  He said you were on the property.  I never went over there.  We've been through this a hundred times.  Not a hundred, but I never went over there on their property.  I've been on this public access.  Why can't you just give me your name and... I gave you my name and info.  Because you're working in your official capacity and you approached me.  And you're out in public and don't have any ID.  I don't need one to walk out on the road in public.  You're supposed to have an ID on you.  It's a law that every American has to have an ID.  This is not, for one, it's going to stop an ID state.  Number two, I didn't break a law.  Show me, show me.  I hope you know that.  Well, the Constitution has it written out pretty clear.  Then the Supreme Court said you don't have to have any permission to take pictures of public property.  I never said you couldn't take pictures.  But that's all I was doing.  I never went over into their property.  You were on their property.  I've been there with their employees. ",
