            "text": "So, I actually brought this up on Twitch a couple of weeks ago.  By the way, you can follow me on Twitch.tv slash BassFCZ.  But, I was thinking about the 22 Convention.  Now, for those of you who don't know, the 22 Convention is a... Shoot.  It's a convention... If I understand correctly.  Sponsored by the 22 Convention, which I think last year was a men's conference where they talked about, you know, men's issues.  But the 22 Convention that's going to happen in Orlando, Florida, I think sometime in May, I think in early May, is about women.  Or specifically, their grand tagline is... making women great again.  Now, I thought about this one critically for a little while.  And I was just greatly befuddled by the marketing choice here.  And I'm not the best marketer or anything like that.  But there was something about it that just kind of seemed a little off to me.  And it's not really like the idea itself.  The idea behind the convention is a bunch of men teaching women how they can become better women for males they want to date.  no issue there, that makes perfect sense.  I mean, if a woman wants to date a man and be married to him, like, doesn't it make sense that she would have to appeal to what he desires in some way, shape, or form?  Now, a lot of times, the idea that women should do anything to be favored by men is oftentimes criticized, especially in our heavily leftist, feminist-esque society, like mainstream society, totally laughs at this, the principle, nature, and idea.  For example, you'll have this. ",

            "text": "Yes.  Well, it says the world's ultimate event for women.  No, but it also says, with a trademark, make women great again, full women.  We're already great.  We're already great.  How do you think you got here?  It's already known.  Cuz we great.  None of us signed up for this.  Now, that was from The View, The Real, I don't know, some daytime woman's talking show, which we'll revisit in just a second.  But I want to really focus on that.  I'm not criticizing the idea itself, but, okay, maybe some of the idea itself, but more so the marketing first and foremost.  Because this is something that just kind of was, like, bizarre to me.  Now, the tagline is Make Women Great Again, which is a clear and overt... reference to Trump's 2016 election campaign tagline, Make America Great Again.  Now, this is really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really weird to me that the guys who are organizing this convention would invoke Trump, of all people, when their target audience, I assume, would be young ladies because Trump is not particularly popular amongst young ladies.  And, and this is the kicker here, the ladies that Trump is popular with are mostly conservative women.  Which means they're probably, more than likely, more prone to the idea of becoming married and being good wives.  Usually.  Not necessarily the case, but usually.  So... invoking Trump, or conservatism, in the bigger picture, to women who already agree with the message, just seems like you're preaching to the choir here.  Obviously, as far as marketing is concerned, in order to create the 22 Convention to convince women to become better wives and partners and ladies for males to date, it doesn't really make sense to appeal to the women that already feel that way.  And the women, who would absolutely 100% would need to hear this message, probably are already going to be turned off in its nature just by that tagline alone.  In fact, the implication of any line, make X great again, implies that currently it's not really all that good.  And one of the biggest issues that are affecting young ladies in 2K20 is they're remarkably arrogant.  Obviously, not all of them.  In fact, I'll go into detail about the ones that aren't in future videos.  But one of the biggest issues that a lot of women are feeling when it comes to their hypergamous instinct that we're going to invoke red pill or MGTOW, you know, philosophy is the fact that they elevate their worth and status far more than they probably realistically should in terms of any functioning relationship and also what they're valuing isn't really even conducive to a relationship and thus has there's no real reason as to why it be the case in the first place.  but Again, that's something I'll have to go into detail for later.  What I really want to focus on now, and a couple of other things, is the fact that the women who are arrogant aren't going to be humbled by this convention, I don't think.  And to be fair, I'm uploading this video a few months before the convention is even a thing.  Maybe they might address this there, and if they do, I'll gladly make a video and talk about it again, but... From what I can gather, and I've only just seen Stefano Malini talk about it a few times, but from what I can gather, it doesn't seem like there's really much of any attempt to humble or reevaluate or get young ladies who would need to hear the message of becoming better wives or better women to appeal to men.  This doesn't sound like there's any ability, or I won't say any ability, but any goal to try to humble them and make them reevaluate why they feel like they're super special and why they feel like they deserve the absolute best when all they really did was just have a string of awful relationships.  You know what I mean?  But who knows?  Maybe this convention will address that.  That's just what I hope it will address.  And if it doesn't address that, well, then I feel like it would be a huge missed opportunity.  So maybe they will.  I don't know.  But moving forward from that point alone, the fact that as far as targeting goes for the demographic, the women that would need to hear the message of the 2022 convention, I think will immediately be taken aback by it and 100% absolutely will not invest in it.  But I think more than that, not just, you know, the invoking of Trump seems like a dumbass idea to me personally.  More than that, there's also something, and this is the main bulk of the video, the main thing I want to say away from this, I think is really critical and missing about the 22 Convention.  And that is, and I know you're going, I just got to be real here.  There's... There's nothing stopping women from dating men and getting married.  So, like, why do they need any guys to come on stage and tell them what they need to do to get married?  Now, I know there's some people who are going to be telling me that there's lots of lonely women and there's lots of single women.  And that's true.  There are.  But the truth of the matter is, a lot of those women are lonely and single because they choose to be.  It's not that they don't have the option to find any man to date.  It's that, again, they're kind of arrogant and don't think that they should date the men that are presently available.  A lot of marriages break down for a lot of different reasons, but one of those reasons is just settling.  The idea that... This is mostly from the woman's point, by the way.  They're mostly just with the guy because they couldn't get anyone better.  They couldn't get anyone else.  So they don't really put in much effort to perpetuate a relationship that they never really wanted in the first place.  They just wanted security, so... Like, why should I try to appease this dude I don't even like?  That's, like, one of the biggest reasons why marriages fail.  But more than that, apart from just the settling, you gotta keep in mind about, like, what the nature of being a young lady is, just, like, in general.  even if you're like incredibly socially awkward girl, even if you're an incredibly ugly one, you know, you could still find some dude to date you.  And if you're a woman who is just attractive, or even reasonably attractive, there's no challenge at all to find males who want to date you.  The only challenge is just picking one.  that's good.  Unless the 22 Convention is going to be trying to talk the English on, like, mate selection and picking the good males who will approach them, I don't find it to be conducive to anything.  I don't think that it would even make any degree of sense to try to get women to convince them into being better when they don't have any incentive to be better.  Because that's the real thing here.  As far as I see in 2K20, there ain't really much incentive for any woman to really... try too much to date males as much as the incentive is being a better person and mate selecting well for your children and like your potential like family.  you know what i mean and i'll go into detail on that in just a second.  but i just kind of wanted to highlight my point really specifically because there's a couple of things i really have in mind here because i was sitting here thinking about this and i was like.  you know being a woman even if you're just mildly attractive or just kinda slightly unattractive, even if you're just overweight and fat, there's still a market of men who want you and you've got chubby chasers.  Now, if you're a chubby woman and you're like, I don't want some guy to fetishize me, that's you.  You've made the choice to not go to the market you're appreciated in and well, I can't help you.  The only thing I can really say to you at that point is you're just going to have to focus on losing weight or you're just going to have to go find someone that likes you who you are.  There's a whole market of people who are fetishizing you.  If you don't want to partake in that, I can't make you.  there's a whole lot for you know what you are you know who to get into something different and that seems to be wholly the issue with like women in their life makes less electing.  like.  it's just that they just don't like the options present but at the time the options present they are really even terrible options.  it just you know this often times in my particular things about them that they just Don't jive with it.  They don't want to work to focus on changing and improving.  And that's a whole separate video that we can go into detail about that.  Maybe the 22 Convention we'll talk about.  I don't know.  And that's the idea of slight tweaking or compromising or growing with people and learning to love and accept them.  Which, again, is a whole topic that I'll go into some other time.  To specifically focus on this one, and I kind of want to leave you guys off with this one, because I really do mean this, right?  Like, if you're an attractive woman, you can really mess up in life and just, like... You just can't take any L's.  And this is the nuclear... Here's the thing, dude.  Let's be real about this one, right?  Mia Khalifa is married, okay?  Mia Khalifa is married.  Mia Khalifa... At one point, she was one of the most popular porn stars.  She's probably, like, in any top ten most popular porn stars ever.  Mia Khalifa's probably always going to be on that list somewhere, right?  Okay, just, you know.  This woman was a porn star.  Everyone has seen her bits.  She is kind of a dick.  I remember there was a period of time where if guys tried to, like, if some athletes tried to, like, shoot into her DMs and try to spit game to her, she would put them on blast.  Like, there was something wrong with that for some reason.  I don't know.  I'm not a woman.  Maybe you guys can explain that one to me, but... That's her.  Like, her character wasn't really the most fantastic, just in general, by all stretch of the imagination.  I mean, I gotta make a whole video talking about Mia Khalifa at some point in time.  I really do, but just for the sake of this one, this woman, Mia Khalifa, got married.  Now, ironically... Which isn't just something that blows my mind, but ironically, the way she found the man that she married to, I think he's a cook, was through like an Instagram DM exchange.  So I guess it's okay to DM her as long as you look good or something.  I don't even know.  I don't know.  I don't know what the rules are when it comes to Instagram DMing, but apparently athletes and chefs are just on two different levels.  The point is, my friends... Mia Khalifa was a porn star.  She had breast implants.  She's not even natural.  She's just kind of, meh, she's just kind of okay looking.  And even she found someone to marry her.  Like, if any woman cannot find someone to marry them, like that, at that point, you gotta stop and say, hey man, there's gonna be something up with you, right?  And I say this about ladies, it's like, because there is that i made a video about themselves and i'm going to solve it.  this woman here i'll put on the screen for you guys to see.  even she was able to find someone out great to the guy she's with.  is these born dexter?  he's he's a geek zoid you know he's.  he's a nerd or he's.  he's not very attractive but i'm not being very you know capricious about this but like He's just not, you know, he's not high on any sexual marketplace value metric you want to create.  He's just not.  And hilariously enough, even during the interview, the woman herself, looking as she does, let's just be frank here about this one, guys.  You know, let's not be PC to be frank.  Looking as she does, even she doesn't really seem to be hyper-attracted to the movie that she's with.  It just seems like she's just kind of, well, you know, eh.  She just kind of seems there.  If this woman is able to find someone to date her, you mean to tell me that average-looking chicks can't find guys?  Of course they can.  Of course.  There's no shortage of dudes.  And even if there was a shortage of dudes, you know what these girls could do?  They could just go to China, who has an overwhelmingly huge population of males, and go pick from them.  So one of the biggest issues that's really sorting with women is their hypergamy is just malformed, as in it's inward on themselves rather than on their children.  More on that at some other point in time.  A lot of them are remarkably arrogant.  A lot of them are remarkably insecure.  Like, they're just a huge... It's just not balanced, man.  You know, it's so big, it's not even in the frame of the camera.  The discrepancy is so big.  So, they're too arrogant.  They're too insecure.  And you can just say in there, you can just slice in, like, you know, emotional insecurities and mental problems and all of that.  And the fact is, they just don't like the selection presented to them.  Those are the issues that are really plaguing women when it comes to having good relationships.  And if a porn star is able to find someone to marry her, and if an incredibly malformed woman is able to do this, anyone in between should be able to knock this crap out the park, but they can't.  And it seems the game reasons to me, while complex, I simply summarized, are those.  In other words, the only thing that's actually stopping a lot of these women from finding good men to be with is just themselves.  So unless the 22 convention is going to address the fact that women are just like their own mental barriers into finding good, happy relationships, it kind of seems to me that the convention. ",
