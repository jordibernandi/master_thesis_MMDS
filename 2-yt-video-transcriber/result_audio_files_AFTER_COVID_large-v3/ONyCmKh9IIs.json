            "text": "I'm going to wait for a couple people to log on to this live.  I was driving home just thinking about this whole situation with Dwyane Wade.  I've prayed about it a couple of times and you know there's a lot of different opinions.  I've seen that Boosie and other celebrities have had a lot of things to say about it and I've been talking about this topic for about six years and Everything that we see happening right now just shows me even more so that the Bible is true, that God's word is true, because everything that I've been prophesying since I was in South Korea and I was still in the military, it's coming to pass, it's gaining momentum and it has to be addressed.  So I hope enough of you share this video that it crosses Dwyane Wade's radar and he sees it.  And I have a warning.  So if you see this, I want to address it to you.  D-Wade, if you happen to see this video, everything I'm about to say, I'm about to say it in love.  And I felt in my spirit.  Now, you might think, oh, this is just some crazy religious nut on the internet.  But I felt this in my spirit.  And I hope that you hear it.  And I hope that you receive it.  And everything that I'm about to say, I say in love.  I hate no one.  D. Wade, what the Lord told me to tell you, first he told me to give you two passages of scripture, and then I will address the rest of you.  D. Wade, in Luke 17, 2, it says, it's better to be thrown into the sea with a millstone tied around their neck than to cause one of these little ones to stumble.  And in Proverbs 22, it says to train up a child in the way that they should go.  D-Wade, I feel this in my spirit strong.  God is warning you and I hope you see this video.  Do not allow this boy to mutilate himself.  I understand that you are trying to walk in love and I don't know if that is what you guys have decided as a family.  I saw this guy, Boosie, he was talking about it.  Other people have talking about him making the transition.  When God created everything, when he made a man, a man and a woman, a woman, he said it was good.  He got it right.  So if God says it's good and we say, no, you're wrong.  That is a spirit of rebellion.  It is the spirit of the Antichrist.  All right.  God said how I created it.  It's good.  So if he made a man, a man and he made a woman, a woman, that's what he wanted.  So D Wade, I understand that it is very a difficult situation because your son is very young, but the Bible says he knew them in the womb before they was in the womb.  He knew them.  So what your son is, is what God wanted him to be.  And the Lord is telling me to warn you, do not, do not allow him to be, let him make that decision when he's 18.  Because in Luke 17 too, it says it's better to be thrown in the sea with a millstone tied around your neck than to cause one of these little ones to stumble.  And I understand that you want to support him.  Now, let me tell you the other side of it.  D Wade, you have lived a life, I'm pretty sure you've messed around with a lot of women and that is no judgment.  A lot of us have done the same.  So your sin is no different.  But the Bible says that two flesh become one flesh.  Now there are a lot of people who say they were born that way.  And you said that your son knew that he was a girl when he was three.  Let me tell you something D Wade, sometimes the sins of the father can jump on the children.  And I'm going to give you an example.  The Bible says two flesh become one.  I guarantee you some of the women that you have slept with have been entertained the spirit of homosexuality and you became one with it.  Now I'm not, I don't know.  I don't not going to disrespect you as a man and say that that might be something you're struggling with, but it is very possible that there are women that you have slept with And everybody that they slept with.  So think about this.  The woman you slept with, you become one flesh with them.  That's what the Bible says.  And every man that they've ever slept with and every woman that those men have slept with, you've become one with all of that.  So I guarantee you, some of them have entertained homosexuality.  And those spirits you become one with.  And the Bible says that we wrestle not against flesh and blood.  So D-Wade, number one.  I want to commend you on the fact that you are choosing to walk in love with your son, but walking in love and supporting it and leading him down that wrong path, which he is not capable.  He is not capable of the ages.  He's never lived as a man yet.  So how can he know?  Okay.  And I'm about to address the other side of it in a second, the hypocrisy.  Okay.  But D Wade, hear what I'm telling you.  And this is what the Lord told me to tell you.  I said all that to say this, and I hope these people share this video so you can get this message.  The Lord wants you to seek him about this.  He wants you to pray.  I know you might not know how to pray, but the Lord, before you make any decision, he wants you to pray.  He wants you to bring it to him.  And even if you just obey this video and in your own way, you find a private place to pray about it.  God is going to show you beyond a shadow of a doubt that that is wrong.  He's going to show you beyond a shadow of doubt, whether he gives you a dream or you have some kind of spiritual encounter.  If you take my word, God is going to show you not to go down that path with your son.  Let him make that decision when he's 18.  But the Bible says, as for me and my house, I understand that you might not know what you're dealing with.  And I'm going to tell you exactly what you're dealing with.  You're trying to be a supportive father, right?  And you see what is happening in the flesh.  But the Bible says we wrestle not against flesh and blood.  What is going on with your son, D. Wade, is spiritual.  There are spirits that are on him.  Just like we have it here in Chicago, people killing people for no reason.  Just like we have these drag queens and all that stuff.  It's a spirit D-Wade.  And I'm telling you what the Lord told me to tell you.  If you pray about it and you don't have to pray a fancy prayer, he's going to show you.  He's going to reveal to you.  not to go down that path.  And the verses I gave you is Luke 17, two.  One more time.  It is better to be thrown in the sea with a millstone tied around their neck than to cause one of these little ones to stumble.  Don't you dare let them cut off your son's man parts.  Now.  I'm going to address everybody else.  I hope that you guys share that.  So D Wade can get that.  This is not about getting clout or trying to go viral.  The Lord gave me this and I've been praying about this for a while.  This whole situation with Christians, how you're looking at it.  Yes, we have to stand up for righteousness and say wrong is wrong, but We also have to walk in love and understand that there are people in the world who are fighting spirits and they don't even know what they're fighting.  So when you judge them, right, and you bash them and you act self-righteous and you act holy and now what the Lord told me to ask you is what if it was your child?  Because many of us think, oh, it can never be us.  But what if it was your child struggling with those spirits?  Then how would you handle it?  How would you deal with it?  Because you're going to want to love your child because what?  All sin is sin.  If my child is struggling with that spirit, it's no different than their daddy struggling with fornication or adultery or pornography or drugs because all sin is equal.  Jesus died on one tree for all sin.  So be careful how you judge and bash other people because some of them are wrestling demons that you've never had to wrestle with.  And yes, people say, Oh, I was born gay.  You might've been born fighting a spirit, from the very day you entered this world because of the sins of the father, because of soul ties.  So as believers, we have to ask God to open our eyes to the spirit world.  And so we're not looking at D-Wade like, oh, you bum.  Oh, you idiot.  Why would you do that?  He's trying to love his son, but he doesn't have the spiritual insight to really realize what his battle is against.  So as believers, we have to learn to walk in wisdom and wisdom is going to be important because you see this stuff is continuing to come out and happen and it's coming to people's jobs.  It's coming to the daycares and you're going to have to learn.  Yes, to stand for truth and say wrong is wrong, but you're going to have to learn to use wisdom.  And you're going to want to be a reflection of Christ.  It's going to be very interesting.  I wonder if this gay guy who's running for president, if it was him versus Donald Trump.  I really wonder what Christians are going to do if it comes down to that.  Which side are they going to stand on if they're not going to vote at all?  But remember, I've been saying this stuff for six years and I'm about to wrap this video up now because I don't want it to be long.  Six years I've been telling you guys what the Lord showed me.  He showed me a golden statue.  It said LGBTQ on the side, and there was a sound.  It was like a trumpet.  There was a sound to bow down, but it wasn't a trumpet.  The Lord showed me it was legislation.  It was laws.  And so the future of our children, right?  For many years in America, we've been able to go to church freely and say what we want and do what we want.  And now everybody's getting offended and things like that.  Think about your children, right?  Think about them having to be Christians in this climate.  They're already trying to brainwash them in the schools.  So be very careful when you judge other people and worry about your children.  And you better be seeing in the spirit.  I know people, I don't like Donald Trump.  The Lord, I'm telling you what the Lord showed me.  He's a wall that is holding back what is about to come.  And you can laugh and you can mock.  But when I said he was going to win the first time, people laughed and they mocked.  All right, after he gets out of office, they're gonna look for the most liberal person.  And you have to understand this, people who have no conscious of God or conviction, They feel like.  it is their duty to get into these people.  Even the gay guy, I don't know how to pronounce his name.  He's running for president.  He said that what they're going through is the same as black people in the 60s.  They believe that in their mind.  So they believe that they have to get in positions of power to change things.  That means there's a collision coming.  Share this video because I feel D-Wade needs to see that.  And D-Wade, if you happen to see this video, just know it's no hate.  It's all love.  That's what God wanted me to tell you.  If you pray and you seek him about it, he's going to give you a warning that you cannot deny.  Just know I love you.  Just know that I don't think that I'm no better than anybody else.  If you happen to be homosexual and you come across this video, if enough people share it, just know, look, All have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God.  And you might feel that you were born that way, but the reality is you're just fighting spirits because of sins from the past, because of soul ties.  And we all must be born again.  I had to go down.  I had to repent just like anybody else.  And there's room at the cross for you.  Please know, please know that Brother Marcus hates no one.  I'm not homophobic, nothing.  But I have to stand on what the word of God says, even though it might not be politically correct.  Okay, but I'm doing that with love.  If you feel like, man, I just can't help it.  I just can't overcome.  I'm a man and I'm lusting for man.  I'm a woman and I'm lusting for woman.  I'm telling you, it's a spiritual battle that you got to fight.  So what you're going to have to do, you're going to have to realize I can't do it on my own strength.  There's some people who can't stop watching porn.  There's some people who can't stop drinking in their own strength.  You're going to have to tap into the supernatural.  All right.  And you're going to have to ask God to lead you and show you how to do that.  I don't want to drag this video.  Please, guys, share this video.  I'm going to put it on YouTube.  I just I hope that D. Wade sees it.  If it's meant to see it, he's going to see it and pray over everything else.  Pray for his son.  Pray for his family.  Pray for anybody who's fighting and battling that.  I'll be blessed.  Have a good evening in Jesus name. ",
