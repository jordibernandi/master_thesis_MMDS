            "text": "Today I got served divorce papers.  It hurts so much to know that I lost my best friend because I was stupid.  Sometimes I roll over to his side of the bed in the morning and I hate how I don't feel his body there anymore.  I miss his smell, his smile, and his voice.  what's going on everybody?  hope everybody's feeling good.  hope everybody's doing well.  we are back with another story guys.  i will put the link to this in the description.  like usual you guys read the title.  let's get into it.  so i cheated on my husband of 14 years and i lost him forever.  oh This is long, but it's something I needed to get off my chest.  My husband, who's 36, and I am 36 as well, have been together for 16 years and married for 14.  We have two daughters who are 13 and 12.  About three months ago, I cheated on him with my co-worker once and immediately regretted it.  To be honest, I still haven't figured out the real reason I cheated.  On the surface level, the reason would be that my husband was too caught up with work for a couple of months and I felt neglected and unappreciated.  I know that isn't the real reason, so I'm trying to figure out what is through individual counseling.  I only cheated on him that one time and immediately told him the next day because I couldn't bottle up my guilt and shame.  He was shocked at first, but then went on to call me the most horrid names.  I deserved it.  I deserved a lot more than that.  I don't even know how it got to the point of me sleeping with my co-worker.  It started with the innocent flirting, and before I knew it, I made the worst mistake of my life by sleeping with him.  I wish I'd gotten hit by a car that day before sleeping with him.  I cut off all contact with my coworker and gave up my phone to my husband.  I wanted to reassure him that I was willing to make this work on his term, whatever they were, as long as he would give me another chance.  Even though in my heart I knew that I wanted another chance to prove myself, I told him that I would understand if he went through with a divorce.  i told my husband that i would do anything to regain his trust and express my sorrow and regret for having hurt him so much.  my husband has always been the type of guy to give a person only one chance even in his friendships if the trust had been broken he wouldn't give the other person another chance.  He said that he wanted a divorce, but then the whole quarantine thing happened and he stayed in the house for about two months and didn't proceed with the divorce.  For the first month, he treated me very coldly and the only time we talked was when it had to do with our daughters.  I slept on the couch and tried to give him as much space as he needed and only reminded him from time to time that if he ever wanted to work things out, I'd be more than willing to and would be completely devoted to the process of him working things out.  He even said some spiteful things during that month and distanced himself from me completely.  During the second month, there was a change as he began talking to me again.  We talked about daily stuff and even watched movies together with the girls as a family.  I felt like he wanted to reconcile and I was happy.  I was so thrilled that there might be a chance to save my family.  To save us.  Eventually through the next couple of days I could sense us becoming friends all over again.  He even invited me to sleep on our bed again.  It was really working out and I reminded him that he could talk about anything he wanted with me.  A couple of weeks passed by and we were getting along even better.  We were spending time as a family again and had gotten closer with each other as well.  I felt really good about the way things were going, but I wish I would have suggested marriage counseling.  I just didn't want to pressure him and have him think that I wanted to sweep the situation under the rug or that I was trying to influence him to not divorce me.  One night we were drinking a bit, just talking in our bedroom, and I felt a genuine connection rebuilding.  it felt like we were falling for each other all over again and it made me so happy.  this is the part i regret now.  i decided to make a move on him and straddled him while we were laughing at a joke.  we looked each other in the eyes and so naturally i began making out with him.  It honestly felt like we were 20 all over again.  He kissed me back as well, but after a while, he just started crying.  He told me to stop and said that he couldn't.  I felt so awful because I felt like he wanted to, but didn't at the same time.  It broke my heart to directly see just how badly my stupid decision had hurt him.  I told him that I was sorry and we went to sleep.  the reason i say i regret doing this is because i feel like this moment pushed him away forever.  two days later he informed me that he wanted to go through with the divorce.  he said that he just doesn't think he could make it work even after trying for the last two months.  i wanted to fight with him about it but i just told him that i understood.  We had already decided before that if a divorce was to happen, it would be on fair terms.  Sure, we'd both have lawyers, but we agreed on a lot of stuff together.  He wanted to take a two-week trip but would come back to pick up the girls after his trip.  We both mutually agreed that we'd split the time with the girls after this trip.  They would spend half of the week with him and the other half with me.  I even helped him pack up his stuff and when we finished I just bawled my eyes out and hugged it out.  After his two week trip he came back and it felt good seeing him again but I knew it wasn't the same.  He just smiled and we made small talk before he took the girls.  We are both really good parents and want the best for our kids.  Today I got served divorce papers.  It hurts so much to know that I lost my best friend because I was stupid.  Sometimes I roll over to his side of the bed in the morning and I hate how I don't feel his body there anymore.  I miss his smell, his smile, and his voice.  I miss him filling up the entire room with his loud, adorable laugh.  I miss him so much.  The thing that hurts me the most in all of this is knowing how badly I hurt the person I love the most.  I wish I could go back in time and undo what I did, but I can't.  So now here I am writing about it on Reddit while crying when there's nothing I can do about it.  I wish I could let him see for himself what I genuinely feel in my heart about how sorry I am about how I would be the most devoted wife ever if he just gave me another chance to let him know just how much I love him and I'd literally do anything for him.  I asked him the most perfect thing that ever happened to me.  I wish I could get him back, but I know that I lost him forever.  Whip.  Should have thought about all that before you did that.  Let me get my thoughts.  She regrets it.  She regrets it.  She said she told him immediately after she did this.  Guys, isn't it funny?  Every time, it's always the coworker.  What does that tell you?  If you guys decide to get in relationships and all that stuff and she's working, there's a good chance it could be a coworker.  I heard once i don't know who i heard this from and i feel like i heard it on youtube.  women go to work to find a relationship.  it's interesting like anybody who's ever worked in the office anybody who's uh just work period anywhere married women mess with the guys there.  they have work husbands and things like that.  You know, they spend a lot of time together going on lunch breaks, things like that.  So I'm not really surprised.  It's always a coworker.  I under, cause read these stories.  I understand like, okay, after work, you know, working and seeing it.  Okay.  I get it, but it's always the coworker.  But, um, she regrets it.  Like you didn't regret it when you went to the guy's house, when you started kissing on him, you actually went through with the sex and then you regretted it.  You would think that if they really regretted what they did before they engaged in the sex, something would hit them like, hold on, I have a husband.  But for some reason, for some reason, they don't regret it until after the sex.  And I have to wonder, is it because it just wasn't good enough?  Because I'm pretty sure if she cheated on her husband, or and she went she was willing to go and cheat on her husband and it was some of the most amazing sex she's ever had nine times out of ten.  she will not tell him ever because she enjoys it.  it's her little side thing.  If she would have enjoyed it, she would have never told him.  So does she really regret it?  Not really.  She just regret the person she cheated with.  She wished she would have cheated with someone better.  You guys notice she almost sucked him in.  You know, unfortunately, because of the pandemic, you know, he was stuck in the house.  They were both stuck in the house together.  And I'm pretty sure it was going through his mind.  Like, man, I can try to forgive her.  But he couldn't.  You know, she gave her body away.  Like, that's a hard thing to forgive.  That's a very hard thing to forgive.  But they started drinking that one night.  They're watching movies as a family.  She's loving it.  Oh, it feels like I'm 20 years old again.  She likes that feeling.  If she would have sucked him in, eventually she would have did what she did again.  Because she was enjoying that moment of feeling young again.  feeling free again probably why she cheated.  she felt single again.  he's never.  he clearly can never make you happy if you're willing to give yourself away like that and betray him and lie to him and be and deceive him.  she almost sucked him in and he realized like hold on man she did some disgusting things.  he went on a trip Probably had himself a great time.  He came back smiling, feeling good.  He's like, yeah, okay.  Let's go ahead and do this divorce.  He said that before he left for the trip, but he's like, yeah.  Let's go ahead and get this divorce on the road.  I'll see the kids half the time.  You see the kids half the time?  We're good.  And she's salty.  She is hurt.  She is hurt.  But, hey, you did it to yourself.  You ruined something that you say was perfect.  ridiculous guys let's check out these comments.  someone says the part where you mentioned him crying.  I felt that my ex cheated on me too and I tried to be normal around him.  and one day he tried making out with me after weeks of not being affectionate towards each other and I just burst into tears.  my mind mentally was trying to enjoy it but physically I had no butterflies and no sparks running through my body.  I felt numb.  It's devastating and you have an emptiness in your stomach.  Your husband will forever wonder what it is that he did that made you do that decision.  I'm sorry for your family to be broken up by such a selfish and impulsive decision.  I hope you find healing in answers.  That one little selfish moment took away.  what she said was perfect.  She said he was perfect.  He was great.  He was amazing.  And she doesn't even understand why she cheated.  What she said, he started working too much?  Did she say that?  It's ridiculous.  And now you regret it and you just ruined something great.  You had two children together.  Things were fine.  But you just had to feel young again.  Someone said, you can't cheat and seriously expect them to stay.  Absolutely.  You can't cheat and expect them to stay.  Or you can't cheat and expect them to be the same person they were before you cheated.  It's just not going to happen.  It's never going to be the same.  Ever.  So... either deal with it or split.  Someone said, sure, you can't expect them to stay, but I think people do deserve a second chance.  It's easier said when done when you aren't in that situation.  Really?  don't think there is a black and white answer.  the fact that happened once and she literally owned up to it it also says a lot about her character.  i truly think she genuinely messed up and will and will not do it again.  i disagree.  i disagree 100. i don't think once.  a cheater is always a cheater.  i really hope that he can heal and you guys find a way back to each other.  humans aren't perfect.  we make mistakes as long as we learn valuable lessons from it.  Now listen, yes, we're not perfect.  Humans aren't perfect.  She tells you in the story, I have no idea why I cheated.  We have the perfect family.  Why wouldn't she do it again then?  It wasn't like my husband was drinking a lot, so I cheated.  So for her to not cheat, he needs to stop drinking.  She says herself, him working a lot, it really didn't make any sense because we still had this perfect family.  So, and she admits that she doesn't know why she did it.  She's definitely, she's one, she's like, she's a cheater that will definitely cheat again.  She doesn't even know why she did it.  So she just does it for no reason?  Come on now.  Somebody replied to him and said, sure she deserves a second chance with another person.  She not only cheated on him, she cheated on her whole family.  She put her needs to get off before her husband, kids, and the life they built for each other.  Thank you.  You're married and you built a life together that you said was perfect, was great.  And you don't know why you cheated.  Of course she'll cheat again.  Of course she will.  And she started feeling good when they got drunk that one night, started making out, and she felt like a 20-year-old again.  I think she's giving her answer there.  That's why she cheated.  She wants to feel young again.  She feels old when she's married and things are stable and there's structure.  She wants to feel young again when there was some chaos and spontaneity.  She wants that again.  So absolutely she's gonna cheat.  Again, on another person.  So yeah, I don't buy that man.  Someone said, I don't think it's reasonable to characterize it as once.  There was only physical ones, but the emotional flirting in all likelihood didn't start and end in a single afternoon with a quick run to a hotel to relieve the tension.  Thank you.  They've been flirting for a while.  Going out to lunch.  They've probably been making out at work.  She crossed her marital boundaries multiple times before the final penis and vagina occurred.  Yep.  And there's that mistake.  Word.  And there's that mistake.  word again.  Nonsense.  I'm having a hard time believing that she didn't understand the repercussions of the activity.  In fact, she knew it was bad enough to need to confess after it finally went PIV.  I'll give her credit for the confession, but she knew way before PIV that she was doing something wrong.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  I can't believe that person is trying to defend her.  I just recently had somebody in the comments like they went off on me.  They were saying, oh, she I really believe that she was sorry.  And you're a horrible person.  I'm going to leave your channel because you're a narcissist.  You think that she's she's.  she can't be forgiven.  Like what?  What do you mean?  It was the same situation.  The woman went out and cheated.  And on a ride back home, she said she regretted it.  that doesn't mean it won't ever happen again.  like what do you mean?  like you can't.  you can't give your body to somebody else when you're married and expect someone not to leave why you can't or or expect them not to be different?  if you stay to stay together he's never going to trust you again.  and vice versa.  if a man cheats on a woman And she stays.  She's never going to trust him again.  Or she's probably just going to leave because she knows she's not going to trust him.  Things aren't going to be the same.  It's messed up to put everything on the victim.  Like, hey, okay, she made a mistake.  Now you need to get over it.  And things need to go back to normal.  No, that's not how it works.  That's not how it is.  And I think that's messed up to think that someone needs to forgive somebody for hurting them.  That's not cool.  And I believe that was a guy, by the way, that said that.  I'm just reading it like, dude, are you serious?  Like, you're calling me a narcissist because I think it's okay for this guy to divorce the woman that cheated on him?  Seriously?  You know what risk she puts him at?  STDs?  Really?  Like, that's all okay, right?  He should just forgive.  Oh, it's okay.  No.  And if it was the other way around, no.  If he did that to her, no, she should leave.  Someone said, I was cheated on about a year ago, and it's easily the most messed up feeling I've ever felt because I love her so much.  And it was just the ultimate betrayal.  It's a huge combination of anger and sadness.  It's the worst because the person you are supposed to trust and count on the most screwed you over.  You can say you feel terrible all you want, but that fact of betrayal says a lot about the person as well.  Actions will always speak louder than words.  I'm not saying you're a bad person, but the level of anger and betrayal your husband feels will take a long time to go away.  He may never be the same towards you ever again.  Thank you.  But that is why being unfaithful is the ultimate terrible thing to do to a spouse.  I feel bad for your kids as well because they... Because they will pay the price for something their mother did.  I feel bad for your husband because I know how awful he must be feeling.  I am still getting over my loved one screwing me over.  It's permanently scarring and what you did was all about you and no one else.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Even if you do that to somebody and you guys split.  He's changed forever.  Any little red flag, gut feeling, which you should always trust your gut.  But if he gets with another woman and she works, he's going to worry.  Who's this guy you go to lunch with all the time?  Who's this guy you always talk about when you come home?  You change a person forever when you do that.  And once you understand that, maybe people will say, okay, you know what?  I get it.  I understand.  It's a bad thing to do.  Shouldn't do this.  It's going to ruin him forever.  It's going to ruin her forever.  But anyway, on that note, guys, let me know what you think about this in the comments.  I'll put the link to this in the description, like usual.  Let me know what you think about this and I'll catch you guys at the next one. ",
