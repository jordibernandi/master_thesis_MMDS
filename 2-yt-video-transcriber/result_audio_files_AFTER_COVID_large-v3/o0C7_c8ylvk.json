            "text": "The Trump years have taught us two valuable lessons.  Well, other than we live in a country teeming with idiots who are as angry as they are stupid.  First, the Tea Party never really cared about deficits.  And second, evangelicals never really cared about values.  credibility.  But watch, with a Democrat back in the White House, Republicans are going to suddenly start fretting about all the many things they lost interest in during the four years.  Donald was busy watching TV and golfing.  For example, college.  Donald's school records are all hidden.  And for good reason.  One of his professors at Wharton said, Donald Trump was the dumbest goddamn student I ever had.  Well done.  Fox was bored by that fact.  But Dr.  Jill Biden's dissertation is a source of endless fascination.  But it's not as if they could have dissected Donald or Melania's dissertations.  Because they don't exist.  Naughty words.  Donald knows the best words.  Well, if they're four letters.  You're not going to raise that fucking price.  I'm going to bomb the shit out of them.  Listen, you motherfuckers.  Grab them by the pussy.  But if one person on Biden's team says Republicans are effers, Donald's delicate fans are suddenly clutching their pearls for the first time in four years.  Well, I just fact-checked that remark and it proved to be 100% accurate.  Glory!  Deficits.  Remember how incensed the Tea Party pretended to be about Obama's deficits?  Apparently the problem must have been that they were too small.  I'm looking at you, Ted Cruz.  Not really.  I'm not that much of a masochist.  Because the Tea Party didn't seem remotely interested in Donald's record-breaking deficits.  Qualifications.  Even when the Bar Association found someone distastefully unqualified, Republican senators rubber-stamped their judicial nomination anyway.  Why do I get a feeling that suddenly being qualified will be nearly enough to get an upvote?  Hmm.  Bipartisanship.  Republicans.  who have never even pretended to be bipartisan, are suddenly want to question whether Democrats are sincere in theirs.  I sincerely hope the answer is no.  Ethics and conflicts of interest and the Hatch Act.  Just watch.  Suddenly those rules are going to rise from the dead quicker than a tiny toadstool in the palm of Stormy Daniels' hand.  Executive overreach.  Donald planned a military coup and not a peep from most Republicans.  But the second Joe Biden plans a party or wears brown shoes with a blue suit, all hell will break loose.  Vacations.  We'll be back to tut-tutting over how much leisure time the president spends, even though, no matter how many Joe Biden takes, he won't be lining his own pockets by ripping off the Secret Service with exorbitant room rates at his own failing hotels.  Family values.  Well, your family's values, not theirs.  Senate traditions.  Yes, the overruling of the overruling of the no justices in election years rule.  And titles.  Nobody blinked when silly buffoon Sebastian Gorka called himself doctor for dubious reasons.  But it's now a huge deal that First Lady Dr.  Jill Biden uses that honorary title from an advanced degree she actually earned.  And remember how bored Republicans were when First Lady Melania Trump lied under oath about having a basic degree she never earned.  Oh, perjury is so tedious.  But as we all know by now, Republicans have America's most limber values. ",
