            "text": "Trump saved the country.  Trump supporters saved the world.  And it sounds fucking crazy, but it's just not.  So there's this wild conspiracy theory called QAnon, and a lot of people that potentially believe it are right behind me.  I don't think it's a conspiracy at all.  It's true.  If it's a hoax, it's an elaborate one.  QAnon is a conspiracy that, in a lot of ways, is just a warped amalgamation of a bunch of other little conspiracies.  And it's all unified in support of one figure, President Donald Trump.  Q and adjacent theories have spurred real world violence and have been linked to at least one murder.  The 24-year-old was obsessed with the QAnon conspiracy theory.  Police detained an armed man.  The Hoover Dam was evacuated.  After he blocked Hoover Dam.  Towards the end of 2019, the platform that sort of birthed QAnon was shut down.  So as we get closer to the 2020 election, is QAnon over?  Is QAnon about to be over?  To see for ourselves, we went to a Trump rally.  I need that Q. Let me get a shot of that Q shot there.  Yeah, people love Q. Yep.  Got it.  Yeah.  Nothing but compliments on this shirt.  What we're doing right now is looking for people wearing anything that would signify that they're interested in QAnon.  Here we go.  Perfect.  Are you QAnon supporters?  Who are you with?  What do you mean by supporters?  Your friend said that you were one of the biggest QAnon people in the Midwest.  Why did you feel like you needed to be here at this rally specifically?  Oh, are you kidding me?  I saw Trump's tweet and I was like, he's going to be at Minneapolis?  I've got to go see him.  I support Q and I support President Trump.  QAnon started online when a mysterious poster claimed that they had inside information on the deep state that was trying to shut Donald Trump down.  I think the biggest accomplishment he's had is exposing the Democrats in the deep state.  It's sort of if you had L. Ron Hubbard and you told him to write a Tom Clancy novel specifically about politics.  Anyone I tried to talk to about it thought I was crazy.  There's all sorts of meandering national security twists.  Now you got this story with Chuck Todd, right?  And you got Jeffrey Epstein, okay?  You got that.  Those two right there are like... With these sort of like fantastic near religious claims.  Trump saved the country.  Trump supporters saved the world.  He's going to get rid of that damn evil that's been running the world and it's over.  God wins.  You see that?  It's done.  Where we go one, we go all is the best slogan of all time because we don't care about any kind of credit whatsoever.  We redirect the glory to God where it deserves to be.  I'm curious to know how you guys got into QAnon, like what led you to QAnon in the first place?  I fell into it.  Okay.  So I found it on Twitter.  On Facebook.  It was YouTube.  YouTube.  Is it database for YouTube?  Twitter, YouTube.  Twitter, YouTube.  Even though a lot of this blew up and went viral on mainstream sites like YouTube and Facebook.  This channel's dedicated to covering information that the mainstream media won't cover.  You've got Beyonce with her Baphomet ring on.  She worships Satan.  What you must learn is that it has always been them.  The core of it is on this message board called 8chan, where people would go and seek out Q posts.  Q was posting on 8chan, which claimed to host the darkest reaches of the internet, and it lived up to that claim, until... The suspect detailed his plans and ideology in a post on the internet forum 8chan.  The site has now gone offline after its cybersecurity provider pulled its support.  Just this year, we know that three separate shooters, including the El Paso shooter, are believed to have posted to 8chan before committing their slaughters.  People sort of lost the direct connection to Q and interest has kind of faded among supporters since then.  It's kind of stopped now.  The QAnon?  Yeah.  What do you mean by that?  The last post, August 1st.  On the ground at rallies, I've noticed way less QAnon paraphernalia than at past rallies.  Panama City Beach, it was nearly ubiquitous.  Reporters there told us it was just like unstoppable.  But here it's really hard to find people who outwardly support the theory.  We looked for QAnon supporters down here to see if we could find any, and we haven't been able to.  That might be because of the sort of de facto ban that Trump's security has instituted at a lot of rallies.  People have still snuck stuff in that we've seen, but not so much on the floor level here.  People we've talked to here say that QAnon has been dying, that it's not what it used to be.  I'm trying to figure out the status of Q at MAGA rallies now.  It's here, but it's definitely decreased.  Like other conspiracy theories, there's always going to be ardent supporters who are there way past the end of it.  Do you expect Trump to ever mention Q?  I think he's mentioned Q before in some of his rallies.  Do you feel like Trump has addressed it properly?  Do you feel like he's dropping hints for you guys?  Do you hope that he'll do that here today?  He does it all the time.  Everybody here, they're open to hearing about Q. They're open about hearing about what's really going on in the world.  That's not to say QAnon is dead.  Trump has been boosting it unwittingly or not.  Look at that beautiful baby.  Look at that beautiful baby.  Wow, what a baby.  What a baby.  The baby was wearing a onesie with Q on it.  That is a beautiful baby.  Guys, I swear to God, I started crying.  Like, it's all real.  It's real.  And that means that we're potentially one Trump tweet away from QAnon rising to full force.  Thank you.  Thank you. ",
