Rather, God and the universe are the same thing.  The universe is God.  The two are identical.  Everything around us, the totality of reality is the divine.  God is everything and everything is God.

The first is the classical religious approach.  The second is the personal or individual approach.  And the third is the scientific approach.  Okay, starting with the classical religious approach.  In traditional theism, God is described as being omnipresent.  God is everywhere at all times.  Now really, how can one distinguish from God being omnipresent in our reality to God actually being all of reality?  What exactly is the difference?  To say that God is everywhere all the time is to say that God is everywhere all the time.  God is everything.  This is then the pantheist approach.  More so, classical theism adopts God as omniscient, meaning God knows everything, he has all knowledge of the past, the present and the future simultaneously.  Again, this is a type of temporal omnipresence, being all of time and all of space at once.  Again, this is pretty much identical to the pantheist approach.  If God is reality, then God is time, God is space, God is the whole cosmos at every moment, past, present and future.  A very rational development to the classical theist approach. ",

Many people say that they have felt God, or maybe just felt an extraordinary feeling.

Science then has no place in the affirmation or discovery of such a being.  as science is solely the study of the empirical and observable universe.  Any talk outside of human experience can be seen as redundant.  However, should we agree that God is the universe itself, we can now inject meaning into this discussion.  Right.  So on a cosmic level, should we see the universe, or perhaps the multiverse, as actually infinite, something that has always existed, did not come into existence and will not cease to exist, can create matter ex nihilo and is responsible for all the laws of nature, then this definition of the universe seems identical to the traditional belief in God and we have good grounds to view the two as identical.

And, to call the world God is not to explain it, it is only to enrich our language with a superfluous synonym for the word.  I am inclined to agree.  An atheist rejects God as the creator of the universe, they just accept that the universe exists.  The pantheist has the exact same line of thought, but has just renamed the universe to God.  This is just a linguistic difference and nothing more.  There is nothing that separates God from everything else in our universe.  So why even make the distinction?

However, there are different levels and degrees of consciousness.  The tiniest tiniest most fundamental element of matter right down to the subatomic level, also known as monads, will contain conscious qualities.  However, these monads will vary in degrees of conscious strength.  How conscious something is depends on how complex the entity is and how many strong conscious monads the entity contains.  So, an inanimate object like a rock will have very weak conscious monads.  A plant, slightly increasing in complexity, will contain slightly stronger conscious monads.  An insect, a more complex organism, will then have slightly stronger conscious monads.  An animal even stronger conscious monads and a human will of course have very strong conscious monads.  This does make perfect sense as we can see varying degrees of consciousness and sentience throughout our natural world.  We can even go so far as to say humans themselves contain varying degrees of conscious monads giving rise to the existence of super geniuses.  Right.  Now the universe as a whole, the most complex and greatest entity contains the total sum of all monads that exist as well as the power to create these monads which would make the universe the highest form of consciousness possible.  Again this is exactly how we understand the classical concept of God but we are breaking it down to a more empirical understanding.  God is therefore the total sum of all consciousness in the universe.  It is not separate from the universe, it is the universe, but it obtains a greater level of consciousness which means pantheism is vastly differentiated from atheism. ",

I feel like my own person, my own thoughts, my own feelings, my own beliefs, my own emotions.  I do not feel like my consciousness is part of anything else or is joined to anything else.  i do not feel like my mind is part of a greater mind but how would you know if it was?  would we not be able to share conscious experiences to be more mentally linked and mentally synced perhaps?

Also, if you claim that you have this complex consciousness and you are undoubtedly part of the universe, then how can a part be more complex than the whole?
