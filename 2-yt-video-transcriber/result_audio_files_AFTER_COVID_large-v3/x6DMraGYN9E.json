            "text": "Thank you.  Tenor Jimmy Fortune toured, sang, and performed with the legendary Statler Brothers for 21 years.  He was inducted into both the Country Music Hall of Fame and the Gospel Hall of Fame in 2008 and 2007, respectively.  Today, his new album, God and Country, says it all because our country needs God and needs to know what America was built on.  There is hope for the future.  This is his story of unshakable faith.  This is today's life.  Jimmy, thank you for sitting down to talk with me today.  What an honor to be with you. ",

            "text": "I knew it was about 1993.  I had been with the Statler brothers for quite a few years.  And I was going through a pretty painful divorce.  My father had been diagnosed with cancer.  And they gave him about a year to live.  And I was really having a tough time dealing with all that.  We were going on the road.  And we stopped in Little Rock, Arkansas.  It was about March 1993.  I didn't want to leave home because my family life was kind of just in turmoil.  And on our way to Little Rock, Arkansas, we got there about 2 in the morning.  It was cloudy and, I mean, foggy.  I couldn't sleep on the bus, so I just got off the bus, and I made my way into... uh... the hotel room and uh... it was just this depressing hotel i think i can't even explain.  uh... i was really down.  i'm really down about as down as i've ever been in my life at that time.  couldn't fix things you know.  and uh... i wondered.  you know i knew that I would never commit suicide or anything like that.  I knew in my heart I'd never do something like that.  But I understood why people get in that frame of mind sometimes, you know, when they get so far down.  I was in the hotel room, and I was sitting there on the side of the bed, and I just couldn't sleep.  I just sat there, and I just, like, I didn't know what to do, what to say.  I wanted to call somebody, but I didn't know who to call.  And I looked over at the nightstand, and the Bible was open.  There was a Gideon Bible there.  It was open.  And I just ran over to the Bible, and I looked down, and it was Jeremiah 525.  It said, your sins and your iniquities have kept good things from you.  Man, I just sat on the side of the bed, and I just felt like Jesus was sitting there right there with me.  I really felt like he was there.  I was like, I know you're here.  And I know he was saying, Jimmy, this is my word.  This is how I speak to you.  You need to open it up and look at it sometimes and read it.  This is how I'm speaking to you now.  Your sins and your iniquities have got good things from you.  Nobody else's name can go in there but your name.  If you're going to change your life, you've got to change it.  with you, and it starts with you.  You can't change anybody else.  You can't do anything about anybody else.  And I just broke down, and I was crying, and I felt like, I said, you know, I know you're here, Jesus.  I know you're sitting right beside me.  I feel like if I look, I'm going to see you, but if I look, I'm doubting that you're there.  And I didn't look.  I just said, I know you're here.  And that moment was a defining moment in my life.  I said, I want you to come into my heart.  Clean my heart out.  Don't just come in the living room.  Come into all the places that I have in there and clean every room out.  And from that moment on, he started working in my life.  And I knew that my life was starting to take a different direction.  And that was in 1993.  So then he began to work in my life that, you know, things were changing.  And I knew it was probably coming to a time when the Stout Brothers were going to end and they were going to say we're retiring because I was a little bit younger than they were.  And I was scared about what I was going to do.  But I knew in my heart that God had a purpose for me, that all those things had led me to that moment.  And then I wanted him to come into my heart.  and be the main part of my life.  And he did.  And I remember running to Harold and Don and Phil and telling them what had happened.  And that even though I was sad in a lot of ways about things that were happening in my life, but I had a peace and a joy that I couldn't explain.  It was more of a power that I could get through this stuff.  And eventually, I lost my father.  He passed away.  And first big loss that I had in my family.  and it was really hard to deal with and of course went through the divorce and everything and started moving on with my life.  but God began to change and do a work in me that I can't explain today but I saw it happen in my father years ago.  he was an alcoholic and I saw him give his life to Christ when I was about 12 years old and he was the worst kind of alcoholic.  I mean you can imagine and from what he did me seeing what he did in his life, that he didn't run from God, he ran to God, through my mother's prayers.  My mother was a big prayer warrior, and I owe her for where I'm at today, and we all do, because our lives were changed by her prayers. ",

I run to him.  Every time something comes up in my life, boy, I mean, and I'm on my knees every night and praying for people.  And people say prayer doesn't matter.  Some people say prayer doesn't matter.  Let me tell you something.  Prayer is the most powerful tool we have.  in our lives.  I've seen it.  I've seen miracles.  I've seen so many miracles that have happened in my life.  I've seen miracles happen in other people's lives through someone asking me to pray for them, you know. ",

            "text": "Well, he's led me to this point in my life that it's been 17 years now, and I teamed up with Bill Gaither about four years ago.  It's kind of led me more into the gospel realm than it has the country realm, even though that's where I kind of came from.  But this new project, God and Country, that we did, I always felt like if ever our country needs God, it's now.  Because after 9-11, when 9-11 happened, when we all came together, Whether you were Democrat, Republican, whatever, independent, no matter what color we were, no matter what religion we were, we all came together and prayed and loved on one another.  And then it's like every day after that, we're getting further and further and further away from God, you know?  And it's like, what happened?  Why can't we come together?  not just when we need God, but when we have Him and He's blessing us so much and we still forget about God.  We still, you know, think that... it's like he's not mentioned, you know, until something really bad happens.  Why does something bad have to happen for us to turn to God?  Why can't we just love him and love each other like he wants us to every day?  And that's why this project that I did was, it's called God and Country and it celebrates our freedom, it celebrates our independence, it celebrates God and what he's done for us.  I feel like this country was built on four words, in God we trust.  it was built on those four words.  And then somehow we keep getting attacked with those four words.  People don't want to hear it.  They want to push it away or whatever.  And I hope that it never happens.  We talk about keeping God in our schools and in our courthouses and in our and our lives, and on our currency, and probably people get tired of it.  But I think if we let that happen, that we really forget about God, we're going to be in trouble as a country.  And so I hope that we always remember that this country was built on faith and hope in Christ. ",
