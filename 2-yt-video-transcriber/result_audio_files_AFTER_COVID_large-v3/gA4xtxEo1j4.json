            "text": "When all I see is the battle You see my victory.  So when I fight.  So when I fight, I fight on my knees With my hands lifted high.  Oh God, the battle belongs to you.  And every fear I lay at your feet And I'll sing through the night.  Oh God, the battle belongs to you.  And if you are for me, who can be against me?  For Jesus, there's nothing impossible for you.  When all I see are the ashes, you see the beauty.  Thank you god.  When all I see is the cross, can you see the empty tears?  So when I fly, I'll fly on my knees, with my hands lifted high.  Oh God, the battle belongs to you.  And every year I'll lay at your feet.  And I'll sing through the night.  Oh God, the battle belongs to you.  Almighty fortress You call before us.  Nothing can stand against the power of our God.  You shine in the shadow.  You win every battle.  Nothing can stand against the power of our God.  Almighty fortress, you go before us.  Nothing can stand against the power of our God.  You shine in the shadow, you win every battle.  Nothing can stand against the power of our God.  Almighty fortress, you go before us.  Nothing can stand against the power of our God.  You shine in the shadow, you win every battle.  Nothing can stand against the power of our God.  So when I fight, I'll fight on my knees With my hands lifted high.  Oh God, the battle belongs to you And every fear I lay at your feet I'll sing through the night.  Oh God, the battle belongs to you.  Then, oh God, the battle belongs to you.  Amen.  The battle belongs to you, God.  We can trust you in the fight.  We can trust you in the storm.  We can trust you in the wind and waves.  You're with us, Jesus.  You're with us, Jesus.  Emmanuel, there's nothing impossible for you.  Nothing's impossible for you.  You're the way maker, the miracle worker, the promise keeper.  We worship you, God.  We center ourselves on you, on who you are, what we know of you.  Full of compassion, rich in love, slow to anger, bounding in love and faithfulness from generation to generation.  No limit to your grace.  No boundary to your love.  So we step into that today, God.  We step into that with faith, that truth, Our minds consciously stepping into that, Lord.  Leaving our cares at your feet.  For you care for us, as the scriptures say.  Trusting the scriptures where it says that be anxious for nothing, but in everything, in prayer, supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God.  And the peace of God that passes all understanding will rule your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.  And so we just step into that verse today.  The God who brought down the giant, the walls of Jericho and shut the mouths of lions, pillar by day and a fire by night, created the universe, came to this earth, died for our sins, set us free from the grave.  We step into trusting that God in this moment with whatever we're going through.  And we sing this truth over our lives and our families, our children and our spouses, our friends, our enemies, our moments, our days, our mornings and nights.  We thank you that you're on our side and you never lose.  So when I fight, I fight on my knees with my hands lifted high.  Oh God, the battle belongs to you.  And every fear I lay at your feet.  And I sing through the night.  Oh God, the battle belongs to you.  And when I fight, I'll fight on my knees with my hands lifted high.  Oh God, the battle belongs to you.  And every fear I'll lay at your feet.  And I'll sing through the night.  Oh God, the battle belongs to you Amen. ",
