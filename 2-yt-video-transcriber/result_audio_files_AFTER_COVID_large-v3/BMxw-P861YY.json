But it's called Pyron of Skepticism because there was this Greek philosopher who was like super cynical and so skeptical that he kind of just burned everything down and couldn't take anything for granted, even knowledge itself, even skepticism itself.

And I can navigate the world with some accuracy, you know, like, so, you know, maybe they are at least useful.

Because I was like, if I'm a brain in a vat, well, even if these \u2013 and I found out later that the historical accounts weren't reliable.  But even if these historical accounts of Jesus are true, if I'm a brain in a vat, what good are they?  How could I \u2013 use this worldly knowledge to say, oh, there's something outside of reality that's divine.  And I'm like, no, I can't do that.  So, but I have no problem with accepting that I will never know that I'm a brand or not.  What's a bigger problem with me is when I can't, like, even if I don't have perfect certainty, which is perfect certainty, I would define as knowing that you can't be wrong.  So some people think they have perfect certainty that there can't be a square circle or there can't be a triangle with more than three sides.  I don't even need that.  I just need some way to operate and say, hey, based on my observation, this is most likely.  And OCD has basically just taken that away from me.  And I'm just wondering, how can I convince myself when I'm so... skeptical and, quote-unquote, I say illogical, but I haven't even established logic yet, to the point where I just want to escape this hole I've dug myself into, which is...

            "text": "It's interesting.  you're saying how you don't necessarily want perfect certainty.  But I think in a way, and I don't know whether this is a religious thing or where it comes from, but this idea of perfect certainty is what's really fucking us all up.  This is why we get into this situation because we have this idea.  It's like if you think mermaids exist and then all day you're out looking for mermaids and you never find any mermaids because they don't exist.  And then someone goes, hey, look at this manatee.  And you're like, well, that's not a mermaid.  That's bullshit.  But it's a manatee.  They're amazing creatures.  So the fact that you have this idea of perfect certainty, and I'm not saying this is what you're going for, but the fact we human beings have the idea of perfect certainty, it's like a supernormal stimulus, that idea of something that feels so good to us.  It's too good to us because it presses all the feel-good buttons in our brains.  And then we can't accept reality, which is uncertain.  I mean, reality maybe isn't uncertain, but we will never be certain of reality.  So, I mean, like it's really difficult and maybe there is no answer.  But what I found really helpful when I get into these, and this is, it's not uncommon at all.  In fact, people talked about this in responses to the How We Let Go survey, exactly, epistemic nihilism, is to do physical things, to do things that... you don't have to be thinking so much.  So a lot of people talk about meditation and simple movements, and that's something that I would enjoy and recommend.  Also just going out for a walk and feeling the weight of your feet on the ground.  You don't need to think, you just need to feel, just for short times.  And that was also obviously the sort of advice that you probably heard a lot with OCD, but I think it's useful for this sort of philosophical problems as well as the mental health stuff.  So I don't know, maybe you've heard that before, but that's all I got. ",

I wonder how the writers are going to resolve this plot.  Like what is the solution here?  And the end resolution is kind of like, well, he kind of just has to live with it.  Like he doesn't go back.  He's still seeing this stuff.  And that really struck with me because it's like, yeah, like we can get to that point.  But at the end of the day, you still got to eat.  You still got to move on and live and do something.  Yeah.  And at this point, it's like, well, as a human being, I have to define my own set of values and figure out what I'm going to do.  And I tend to find nobility in trying to find truth and talking to other people about truth, wanting truth.  And, you know, just like figuring stuff out and helping out other people on their path because I can be just as confused as everybody else.  I certainly don't have all the answers.  But I can find peace in the fact that, hey, at least I'm a little bit closer than I was yesterday to not believing in things that were wrong.  You know, like we can at least filter up the stuff that we know is like super not true.  So I think there's nobility in that.  But that's going to be different for everybody.  So I don't know.

They find out that the reality is literally shit.  And they're like, well, this is a dead end because there's no way I'm going to convince myself that it's otherwise.  And so I might as well live with it.  I mean, at least \u2013 At that point, you also have to realize that not only at the base level, yeah, it's true, reality is literal feces, but it's also all these sensory things that don't appear to be feces, and so that's something too.  And so even if reality is a simulation, for example, that's not the only thing that exists.  There also exists all the sensory experiences that it creates, And that's something valuable in and of itself.  that's not \u2013 it doesn't matter what it's created by, if it's created by atoms or if it's created by ones and zeros.

            "text": "Yeah.  So Soren Kierkegaard talks about this.  He would have called himself \u2013 I mean the language we use now is Christian existentialist because he kind of realized, man, I can't \u2013 I can't prove this thing, this God belief that I have.  But I'm just going to take the leap of faith and live my life to, you know, whatever it is.  Now, obviously, I would disagree with Kierkegaard.  I don't think we should make quite the same leaps of faith that he did.  But we do have to make a leap of faith by saying, yeah, I don't think I'm a brain in a vat because I'm certainly not acting like it.  I'm certainly not trying to get out or whatever.  But, you know, even if I was, it almost does seem like I can't get out of it, right?  So... Again, it's kind of just making the best of the situation that we have and overcoming staring into the abyss and just figuring out, man, where do I go from here?  As someone who has OCD, I can't imagine what that's like because I don't have OCD myself.  I imagine that probably just multiplies kind of the angst that comes with that.  For me, this show is a great way of relieving that, talking with other people.  I think Rebecca's right.  Even if it's just a walk, even if it's just some sort of exercise that you can relax and realize that, hey, everything is okay.  I'm still here.  I'm just moving on, living life.  All things considered, I can say for myself, I'm a pretty lucky person to be where I'm at.  And I hope other people can say the same for themselves, and I hope you can too, River.  But yeah, as far as like, here's the chemical formula to get you out of it.  Man, I don't have that, and I think you're right.  I'm not sure anybody does. ",

If I do one small thing wrong, I have the power to do that thing wrong, and I'll use doing that wrong and finding out that it's wrong as a vehicle to move towards truth.  And I don't care what the reality is.  I'm just going to Move forward.  and because it questions whether I should just do nothing or do the things that I want. ",

So if, if you're, If you're right that, like, saying, you know, other people matter and other people's subjective experiences matter and we should treat them well, and you decide not to do that, then that's really bad.  But if you're wrong and other people don't matter and it's just a solipsistic nightmare, like, you're just alone in the universe, you're just a brain, you're not even a brain, and you carry on acting as if other people matter and being a good person, that doesn't do any harm at all.
