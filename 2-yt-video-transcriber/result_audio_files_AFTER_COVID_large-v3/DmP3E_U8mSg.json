            "text": "hello hello wherever you are in any part of the world hello from my heart to yours.  we are looking at Amsterdam and you can see up above my head we have an orb like ship that has appeared in the Netherlands around 4 in the morning and you also look over here.  we have another one that has appeared and we have one right.  if I can hold my hand Gina which way can you hold it?  I might be the no, I can't put my hand under it right here.  I want to put my hand under it.  Yeah, so this appeared in the Netherlands around 4 a.m.  And I'm going to show the rest of the video footage that I have because it's really spectacular.  this orb up here this orb ship.  It's an organic interdimensional ship.  It has Like a tether cord that gets attached to it from this moon up here and I'm going to try to really zoom in as the clouds go past the moon.  other ships like this appear.  Right above Amsterdam, which is.  It's a lot of energy a lot of things going on and it also like causes this stuff right here and it causes the light to the plasma in the lights to come alive also.  So we're going to watch this rest of this video and please keep an open mind as to what we are looking at because there's a lot of things that we need to bring out into the open while we have the opportunity.  Okay, I seem like I cut probably the tail end of this activity.  You can see right up here that this orb has many other orbs attached to it.  Look at that.  Let me try to get out of the way over here.  Look at that.  They have many other orb ships attached and look what's going on up here with the moon.  Something is definitely occurring in Amsterdam and in the Netherlands.  There is a lot of activity happening in the other dimensions.  Interdimensional activity that we are seeing here.  and look right here behind my head.  We have even more appearing this right here now.  There are people who cannot wrap their mind around what we're looking at because their mind is closed.  If you are one of those people who you are totally dismissing what you're looking at.  I urge you to please open up your mind and step out of that little box that's in your mind because what I'm sharing is very important and it does affect us.  Okay, there are things going on in Netherlands right now.  that are out of the ordinary.  okay this world has changed.  okay it has.  oh look over here on this wall too if we can see.  um where am i at?  over here on both sides there are changes occurring uh and we're seeing more and more of these.  but look you cannot dismiss this activity up here.  it's coming looks like it's coming up here from the point of amsterdam.  are you seeing the energy transfer?  um i'm wondering if amsterdam is setting on a major ley line.  uh what parallel is amsterdam located on?  that would be a good question to uh investigate because this is real.  you all what's happening it is real.  let me just step out of the way a little bit.  i'm gonna walk out you all because um This is from a live webcam in Amsterdam last night around four in the morning.  I think that's what time it said a four in the morning.  Let's look up here.  Yeah, 457.  You can see it up here.  This is the time stamp at the very top up.  It's right over there at the very top.  Ooh, look at this.  Okay, you all look at that.  You see that?  See that movement happening right about that thing and there's been movies on Amsterdam too, I think.  Look how teeny tiny that moon looks because it's not a normal moon.  It really is not.  It's absolutely fascinating to see what's happening.  And you can see this light behind me.  It's being affected too by the energy.  All the lights are being affected.  by the energy that's occurring now.  see this is like the normal looking moon.  now i've got this in a loop.  i think this video that i looped is like um.  look more more up here.  this video that i've got is like um.  eight minutes long.  is um what it is?  you know what i'm going to do also um We need to probably get more activity going on.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. ",
