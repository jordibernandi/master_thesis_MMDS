So what we find is if we expose it to people, then they change their paradigm.  The paradigm, this is what they say, Wim Hof has found the secret of placebo.  Placebo is no longer just over there.  It's now a controllable healing force whenever you need it.  It's the top-down regulated interoception.  It's within our will.  That's the new science.  And that brings us back to the ancestry.  So first, we made this cell protected by a shield, activating the cold shock, heat shock proteins.  then inside the cell you get logically a signal, hey, there is no war anymore.  Energy is not needed to get inflammation out of here or to deal with inflammation or oxidative stress.  Oh, let's go into the close-up proteins of our ancestry.  We can work it out now because now it's silent.  Now it's nice.  Now we got the energy pieces here.  This is the principle, a general principle of nature.  When you are wounded, you retract.  But if you are at war, you can even keep on shooting with a lack of shot.  That's adrenaline, cortisol.  That mode just keeps on going.  That's our society.  That is also wrong.  There is no peace.

First, the core element of the hero's journey, which is the proper journey through life, is voluntary confrontation with what is unknown and terrifying.  That's the human way.  And one of the consequences of that is the rescuing of the dead father, or the hurt father, or the sleeping father.  It's like.  it's a fundamental element of Egyptian mythology, for example, ancient Egyptian mythology.  And it's part of the idea of the dying and resurrecting God.  It's entangled up in that as well.  And it wasn't until recently that I figured out that the consequence of voluntarily facing stress is the awakening of abilities within you that are part of our ancestral heritage.  And so that is how you become a living avatar of the great heroes of the past.  But it never occurred to me that you could find high stressors of a, say, physical type so close at hand.
