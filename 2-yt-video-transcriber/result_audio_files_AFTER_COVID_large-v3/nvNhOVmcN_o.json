            "text": "Hi, and welcome to another episode of Redeeming Truth.  This is called Trust God and Prepare Wisely.  That's the focus here.  I'm here with John, and on Sunday, he preached a message to our church that was about how to respond biblically like a Christian should to the coronavirus outbreak.  And there were two key points.  There were several, eight in total, but there were two key ones that really stood out.  And I took a ton of notes.  I was in multiple services and was greatly blessed by what you preached.  Two of the points though I think apply for us especially.  And that is the point on formulate and the point on faith.  Formulate was about having a strategy and faith was about trusting God.  I admit that in former ways of thinking, I would have been one of those people that's like, ah, what are you all worried about?  Trust the Lord.  What do you have?  All this fear.  Have some faith.  And then I know people who certainly would have said, you know, oh my goodness, the world's going to end.  Go buy all the toilet paper from Costco and hold down the fort at your house.  So kind of both there.  You spoke to a both end.  Want to take us there a little bit from Proverbs and some of the wisdom that you prepared for our church and help people navigate the waters right now? ",

            "text": "Yeah, what happens in times like this is you've got Romans Christians and Proverbs Christians.  You've got people that are all principle, and then you've got others who are all wisdom.  And what I wanna just help people remember is that Romans and Proverbs are both in the Bible.  And so this is not an either or, this is a both and.  So yes, you trust God, and yes, you prepare.  It's not either or.  So you have Proverbs 22, three, the prudent sees evil and hides himself. ",

            "text": "but the naive go on and are punished.  So the idea there is that the prudent person, the person that can see ahead a little bit, the person who's wise, sees evil and doesn't just hide himself like it says there.  Yeah, he gets out of the way.  He does what he needs to do so that the evil doesn't bother him, doesn't harm him.  The naive person also sees the same danger.  but they don't do anything about it.  And so here we are saying the kind of life that God looks at and smiles at, that's wisdom.  That's the fear of the Lord.  The kind of life that God approves of is the kind of life that sees danger coming and prepares for it.  So that's part of it, is you should be prepared.  You should do what you can to be prepared for what's coming. ",

            "text": "Yeah, that's really good.  I have all that under the point.  You did a great job explaining it about prudence, about trusting the Lord.  You said one particular thing, wise isn't scared.  To plan and prepare and to use a lot of wisdom isn't fear.  That's actually doing what God has told us to do.  Proverbs 6, 6, go to the ant, oh sluggard.  Ants prepare ahead in the season ahead.  That's right. ",

And so they know that's coming, so they get ready for it.  And we should be able to look at an ant and learn something from that, learn wisdom from that.  That's what the writer is saying. ",

            "text": "Amen.  Your other point was faith.  And I wrote it down because you said it.  Number three is not at odds with number four.  It was this third point versus the fourth point.  You know, formulate a strategy, be prepared and use wisdom is not at odds with faith because We are to trust God and be prepared.  You said, ask for God's mercy and administer treatments.  Like if a person was sick, you don't throw away all your prescription.  You don't throw caution to the wind.  And yet we trust the Lord.  Speak to faith right now.  How should people be approaching faith?  Is there an element of trust that we should have?  Is unbelief and worry sin?  Are those things we need to confess to the Lord even in times of a pandemic?  Speak to faith. ",

            "text": "Yeah, you absolutely would.  Because at the end of the day, what you have to remind yourself of is who is the God that you believe in?  What does the Bible say about his character?  None of this caught him by surprise.  He wasn't up there seeing people starting to get sick and wondering, what in the world is that?  Send some angels to investigate.  No, it wasn't that at all.  He knows exactly what's going on.  He's working all things according to the counsel of his will, according to Ephesians 1.11.  And because you know that God is good, ultimately because of the cross, Because you know all of these things, it's his character that allows you to have an anchor for your soul in times of trouble.  And so, again, you will go to verses, treat them like fortune cookies, and go, well, there it is.  There's my promise.  I'm standing on the promise.  Listen, promises don't mean anything without the character of God behind them.  So make sure that your hope is in the Lord, that your trust is in him.  But at the same time, you pray that he's gonna protect you, you pray that he's gonna heal, and you wash your hands.  That's so good.  And you buy the things that you need to take care of your family if this is some kind of extended social distancing that our government is asking us to do. ",

We'll put the sermon up on the bottom of the screen or in the info under this video.  I would recommend you definitely check it out.  I'm cheating here.  I'm going to jump to one more point.  We won't go long, but you followed up with fantasy, the idea that if we have enough faith We're not going to get sick.  We're not going to deal with coronavirus.  And you went through a list and man, you rattled it off fast in that sermon.  And I missed a few of them, but I got Job, Jacob, Hezekiah, Paul, Elijah, Tabitha, Trophimus, all sick, all good people, all faithful servants of the Lord.  And none of them were immune.  Speak now in finality here in this episode to the understanding that being a Christian and having faith and trusting the Lord doesn't guarantee that bad things are not going to happen to good people.

There is nothing that can happen to you that can separate you from the love of God that is found in Christ Jesus, our Lord.  And so that's Romans 8.  That's the very end of Romans 8.  And so if you, this is what happens to Christians.  You begin to look at your circumstances, and then it's your circumstances that then teach you theology.  So you look at your circumstances, things aren't right, things are falling apart.  You go, well, then therefore God must not love me.  God must not be good.  No, it's the exact opposite of that.  That God is the anchor, not your circumstances.  You hold on to what you know about him, and then you interpret your circumstances through the truth that you already know.  not the other way around.  You go the other way around, you're ultimately going to trust in your feelings.  You're not going to be trusting in the scriptures. ",

Thank you for the sermon that you preached on Sunday and the short notice of preparation.  Again, that message will be up on the screen or in the info below.  Check that out.  And in the meantime, formulate a strategy.  Yes, be prepared and use wisdom.  Have faith and trust the Lord.  And don't get sucked into the fantasy idea that being a Christian means we are immune.  In this world, you will have trouble, but we take great courage knowing that our God has overcome the world.  So trust the Lord, hold on to hope, and that hope is Christ.  We'll see you soon with another episode of Redeeming Truth. ",
