            "text": "Welcome to Sergeant Dorsey Speaks.  I'm a retired 20-year veteran sergeant of the Los Angeles Police Department, and I am not afraid to pull the covers back, expose that thin blue line, and talk to you honestly and candidly about police training, police policy, and a whole lot about police culture.  Welcome to Sergeant Dorsey Speaks.  over there is William Roddy Bryan.  there was a press conference held with his attorney who he's standing next to and I'm gonna play that for you in a minute.  but I wanted to just come to you because there's some additional information that has come forward in addition to the sorrowful pitiful press conference that his attorney did.  and so listen i think he would have been better off just saying nothing he being the attorney and william roddy brian.  because listen he was crimea river.  you know he's got problems.  he's in fear for his safety him and his fiance and his siblings and his kids.  and you know he's having all of these issues.  You'll hear him explain through his attorney, and then I'm gonna go through it piece by piece.  So why don't we just listen to poor little Roddy's current situation. ",

            "text": "Good afternoon.  My name is Kevin Goff.  I represent Roddy Bryan, a witness to the tragic shooting and death of Ahmaud Arbery.  No parent should have to bury their own child, especially one so young.  As a father himself, Roddy's heart goes out to Ahmaud's family.  Thanks to the public outcry over Mr.  Arbery's death and the manner in which the prosecutors handled it, the family will have their day in court.  It will be for a judge and jury to determine the fate of those responsible for his death.  From day one, Mr.  Bryan has fully cooperated with law enforcement officers investigating this matter.  It was Mr.  Bryan who videotaped the incident in question, disclosed the existence of the videotape, and invited a responding Glynn County police officer to sit with him in his truck where they watched the video together.  Mr.  Bryant went home, came back out to the crime scene shortly thereafter at the request of law enforcement to further assist them.  And then later, Mr.  Bryant voluntarily went to the Glynn County Police Department where he answered all of the questions they had for him without a lawyer during a lengthy interview.  Roddy even gave the police consent to search his cell phone.  The police took possession of the phone for well over an hour and led Mr.  Bryan to believe that they made a copy of everything that they needed before returning it to him.  Despite his cooperation, and for reasons that he does not understand, Mr.  Bryan has learned that the family, and apparently their lawyers, are demanding that he be arrested.  Local media have apparently reported that an arrest is imminent.  Roddy and his family are now receiving threats.  Roddy has lost his job and is now unemployed.  Mr.  Bryan, his fiancee, his children, his siblings, and other family members, friends, and neighbors now live in fear despite the fact that Mr.  Bryan has committed no crime and fully cooperated with the investigation into this shooting.  Contrary to irresponsible media reports, Mr.  Bryan was unarmed at the time of the shooting.  Roddy is a family man, a NASCAR fan, and enjoys rock and roll.  He is not now and never has been a vigilante.  Until this morning, when the Georgia Bureau of Investigation announced it at a press conference, Mr.  Bryan had never been advised by any prosecutor or law enforcement officer that he was a target of the investigation into Mr.  Arbery's death.  Such comments, which are unsupported by the evidence already in the possession of the GBI, have needlessly placed the lives of Mr.  Bryan, his family, friends, and neighbors in jeopardy, and in a matter of moments, effectively destroyed his life.  Mr.  Bryan respectfully asks that the GBI promptly review the file again and promptly clear his good name. ",

            "text": "Thank you.  So there you go.  Let me go through this step by step because I'm hearing a lot of code talk.  And so I feel like I need to decipher some of this BS.  First of all, he starts off by pretending to apologize and saying that no parent should ever have to bury a child.  Yet he co-conspired, facilitated, participated in.  activities that now resulted in the parents of Ahmad Arbery having to bury their son.  And so he talks about as if he did us and the police a favor cooperating with law enforcement, that he disclosed the existence of the tape.  Ooh, when did he disclose the existence of the tape?  and why did he disclose the existence of the tape?  And why did he even make the tape in the first place?  All of which, you know, we won't know unless and until he's charged and then they can ask him those questions under oath.  He probably won't testify.  So we probably will never know the answer to those questions.  Then his attorney goes on to say that he voluntarily went to the station.  He voluntarily went like he did us a favor.  Had he not voluntarily gone to the station, they certainly could have compelled him to go.  You watch First 48.  You know how it goes.  Police come and gaffle you up and make you think that it's voluntary.  But really, you almost must go and answer questions, particularly if you're a person of interest.  I don't know if he was a witness from day one or not, but he says he went to the station and then he he sat in his car and he watched the video with the police officer.  Really?  A police officer sat and watched the video with him.  And well, now we know that they did want to press charges and arrest at least the two McMichaels the night of.  But because the district attorney used to employ Greg McMichael as her investigator.  She gave him the homie hookup and she did dissuaded the police from pressing any charges.  So.  Anyway, then he goes on to say that, oh, he consented voluntarily to have his cell phone searched.  And again, he consented voluntarily because had he not, if they wanted to, they certainly only had to just have him sit there long enough for them to get a judge up out of bed, depending on what time of night it was, write a search warrant and take his cell phone.  confiscate his cell phone.  so again he wasn't doing anybody any favors because he was just trying to be a good guy.  says he answered all of the questions that he was asked without an attorney?  well if he answered questions without an attorney then shame on him because any good attorney will say you never do that right.  you never answer questions of the police without an attorney.  is the inference.  then are we supposed to surmise that he did that because he had nothing to hide?  listen if he was a good guy he would have stopped this foolishness from happening.  he would not have knowing what was about to go down.  number one been there to record and memorialize this for future enjoyment.  and number two he would have done something to stop it.  and if he couldn't stop the mcmichaels from jumping in their truck and going after ahmad He certainly could have got on his cell phone since he had it and was recording.  Rather than record, call the police and alert them as to what was going on because this is a police matter and none of them were.  And then he says that despite all of his great cooperation, he doesn't understand why the family, the Ahmad family, who he was pretending to care about in the first few sentences of this press release, he doesn't understand why the family and the attorneys representing the family are demanding his arrest.  I find all of it offensive.  And so now cry me a river.  He lost his job.  Boo hoo.  He lost his job.  He's getting threats.  He's lucky.  That's all he's getting.  He is fiance.  His children, his siblings all live in fear.  See, this is what they do.  You people, you start some shit.  And you can't finish it.  You're the first one to start something.  And then as soon as things get a little dicey, then you get scared.  You get nervous.  You call the police or you kill someone.  And we don't know what Mr.  Arbery's intent was that day because he's not here to tell us.  What I do know and what I'll share with you, if you don't know the elements of a 459 burglary, it means you enter a structure with the intent to commit a theft or felony theft being a misdemeanor.  We don't know, number one, if Ahmad even entered a structure.  And if he did, if he didn't have the intent to commit a crime.  There is no 459.  And we also now know, according to police reports, that there were no string of, they said it was no string of crimes that had even been reported in the weeks preceding this shooting.  What had been reported by the McMichaels is that their truck had been burglarized and someone took a gun out of it because they left one in there.  Has nothing to do with Ahmad.  That was the only crime, the only break-in that was reported.  And we also know, according to what's being said, is that Georgia is one of the few states that does not have a hate crime statute.  So thus, no hate crime enhancement.  Mr... Brian goes on to say through his attorney that he's asserting he hasn't committed any crime.  I beg to differ and I'm sure some of you do as well.  He wants us to know that he enjoys NASCAR and rock and roll.  What does that have to do with anything?  And that now as a result of all of this, he and his family and his neighbors are a target.  They would not have been a target had he minded his own damn business.  His family wouldn't be a target if he hadn't jumped in his car to follow the McMichaels.  Now, what's interesting to note is that we now know.  that Greg McMichael had history with Ahmad.  While Greg McMichael was an investigator in the District Attorney's Office over in Waycross Judicial Circuit, Greg McMichael was working for District Attorney Greg Barnhill And along with Barnhill's son, the two of them, McMichael and Barnhill's son, the DA, had investigated something when Ahmaud Arbery was a juvenile.  When he was in high school, he had been involved in something that got the attention of the district attorney's office.  Gregory McMichael was one of the investigators, so he knew exactly who Ahmaud Arbery was.  And this case involved Among other things, interfering and obstruction of justice.  And I think Ahmad may have come to school with a weapon of some sort, a gun or something.  And that's what he was charged with as a minor.  And so they keep making a big deal about it.  I want to mention it here only because they keep making a big deal about it.  as if to say somehow whatever he may have been involved in as a juvenile somehow justifies AKA modern day lynching.  He was involved in a crime and therefore he doesn't deserve to live.  It justifies them taking his life.  I find all of it offensive.  And so I'm going to continue to pay attention to what's being said, what's not being said, because what I want to see, and I'm sure many of you do, I want to see William Roddy Bryan arrested and charged with a crime, because if you or I had been anywhere near a friend, a family member who was involved in any kind of criminality, certainly if it resulted in a death, be the driver and see what happens.  You're a co-conspirator, you're the getaway driver, and you're going to be found guilty just like your relative if you were there.  And so the same standard should apply to this Roddy Bryan guy.  I'm offended by this press conference.  I don't see any contrition.  I don't see any real regret, remorse, any empathy or compassion for this family.  I see white arrogance.  I see pale privilege being asserted.  And so I think there may be something out there.  where a petition or something with regards to either William Roddy Bryan being charged and or this campaign that they have in support of these two good white men who were just protecting their neighborhood.  And I believe there's a request, there's an ask, For folks to sign the petition to have them bring down this, it's either a GoFundMe or some kind of page in support of the McMichaels who were wrongly charged.  We know now that to be a lie and there's evidence of it.  So I'll keep you posted and I will let you know as things progress.
