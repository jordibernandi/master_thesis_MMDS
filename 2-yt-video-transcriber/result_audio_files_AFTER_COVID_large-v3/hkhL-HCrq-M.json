            "text": "I think we're all plentily familiar with the dreaded questions for atheists.  You know, those strings of leading questions that, sometimes under cheeky titles like questions atheists can't answer, are pretty much always asked rhetorically to highlight supposedly open and shut points against atheism.  If you don't believe in God, then why is the world fine-tuned for life and where do morals in the entire universe come from?  and why don't you recognize that you have a religion?  Instead of trying to open conversation, these lists feel like they're designed to box atheists into a corner.  Or perhaps more to the point, to make Christians feel like atheists have been boxed into a corner.  This has inspired me to make my own lists of questions for Christians.  Not to respond in kind with a similar gotcha attitude, but to show by contrast how probing questions can be asked constructively between believers and non-believers.  These are questions I would ask in normal friendly conversation with a Christian who feels comfortable talking to me about it.  And while they are designed to get them thinking, they're not meant to work them toward a specific conclusion.  If you use these questions, remember to keep your attitude calm and friendly.  Be tactful but sincerely tactful, not manipulatively diplomatic.  Recognize that these might get the Christian to think, but it will take time for them to sink in, and they won't always lead the person where you'd expect.  And most of all, come ready to listen, with your primary goal being to better understand the person you're speaking to.  Anything less will result in you impatiently trying to rush the conversation to your own conclusions and, frankly, will be disrespectful.  I'll also add that these are meant to delve into the heart of Christianity as experienced by a believer, not into the nitty-gritty of arguments for God.  But don't worry.  If that's more your thing, I have a list of Questions for Apologists in the works as well.  Now before we get started, I wanted to assure you that while my content has been sporadic, this is just because of my schedule while sheltering in a place with my family.  My channel isn't fading away, and I hope to get back on a more frequent schedule in the next couple of months.  Also, you'll be able to find me on a variety of shows next month, including appearances on Talk Heathen, Truth Wanted, and The Line.  And in a very special event, my brother and I will be discussing our histories as former Christians and atheist YouTubers on Shannon Q's channel.  And finally, here's our Sing the Piozzi Song Challenge entry from Heathen Lyre, who is an amazing harp player and, if you listen carefully, you'll notice just might be Pam from The Office.  Breaking down the lies that we see.  Apologists are crazy.  Come sing truth together with me.  And all our minds can be free.  Thank you, Heathen Liar, for that awesome performance.  And with that, here are seven questions for Christians.  Number one.  When did you become a Christian and why?  Now this is a pretty obvious question and it's one I would ask a Christian to honestly consider when discussing their faith.  But while it can be easy for us to convey it as a gotcha meant to corner them into admitting that they were just born into their religion or whatever, it's important to avoid doing this.  Yes, we might suspect that they mostly believe in Christianity because it's the religion of their culture and maybe that they were locked in during early childhood.  But this might not be true for everybody, and even where it is more or less the case, each person's story has a lot of nuance based on their own personal experience.  Reducing it to a disrespectful sounding simplification will put them on guard and might get them either shutting down on you or defending themselves with easy, simplified pat answers, which doesn't encourage the kind of conversation we're looking for.  But if you instead ask this in an open, friendly, sincere way, actually being ready to hear them and make them feel heard, you can ask questions that help them think openly about how and why they became Christian.  Sure, they probably didn't do so because they heard amazing arguments for God, and I doubt they chose Christianity after a careful exploration of multiple religions.  However, you're not going to immediately convince a Christian of this, and doing so shouldn't be your goal.  But maybe you can get the juices flowing so that, over time, they start introspecting more about a process they might not have thought a lot about.  And who knows, maybe you'll come away with a richer understanding of the person and their faith journey as well.  If you're not ready for that, indeed seeking it, I'd say you're not ready to be an honest, respectful participant in the conversation.  Number two, what role have arguments for the existence of God played in your understanding of your faith?  I find this a good follow-up to the previous question, as I honestly don't think arguments for God have changed many people's minds about anything.  In general, I see apologetics mainly as after-the-fact rationalizations designed to help people feel better about what they already believe.  But is it helpful just to blurt this out to the average Christian?  Probably not.  So I'd suggest instead asking questions that might get them thinking about the role apologetics have played in their faith journey, such as, When did you first start hearing arguments for God?  Which arguments have you found most compelling?  How have they affected your thinking?  Were they what actually led you to Christianity, or did they otherwise significantly define your Christian beliefs?  Or did they mainly just reinforce what you already believed?  There are a lot of ways to ask these questions, both in tone and phrasing, so it will be important not to present them as leading or demanding questions.  Sincerely be ready to hear what the Christian says and hopefully prompt them to think through how they came to believe what they do and what role arguments played in the process.  3.  Do you think similar forms of argument, or any line of argumentation, would get you to consider the existence of a different god?  Or of any non-Christian supernatural phenomenon?  This is clearly a follow-up to question two, and the point is probably pretty clear.  If a Christian came to their faith because they were convinced by arguments, and remain in it because they continue to find those arguments most compelling, then it seems they would remain in a state of flux, constantly ready to, in fact seeking to, hear and absorb arguments for other beliefs.  If argumentation changed their mind about Christianity, might they have potential to get argued into Islam or Buddhism or New Age religions or UFOs or any number of other things?  And wouldn't they be curious to investigate this possibility?  This, like previous points, is something a Christian has to be ready to introspect about.  They need to want to understand this part of themselves, and if coming to do so leads them to see their faith differently, it will do so by degrees in ways that don't always meet your expectations.  Even many open-minded Christians may put up resistance to this question, one obvious way being to just flatly state that the evidence for Christianity is way better.  But where did they get this impression?  Was it from literature from within their faith by apologists for their faith?  And if so, have they really considered other arguments, or just listened to speakers they already agree with characterizing those arguments in a way that reinforces their faith?  The world being a big place full of smart people who hold many different points of view, might apologists for these points of view do an equally persuasive job of presenting equally convincing arguments, if you actually listened to those people themselves?  And, here's one huge key, if you did listen to them, would you feel at ease about the possibility that they were right and ready to change what you believed depending on what they said?  Or would you enter the conversation on guard, finding the possibility of changing your faith disturbing?  The fact is, if a Christian came to faith for purely rational reasons, they should be equally ready to leave it for purely rational reasons.  If this is not the case, it's worth considering whether there are deeper, more personal reasons that they became and remain Christian.  Also, notice I've never said anything about evidence.  I've always referred to arguments.  There's a reason apologists have to use lines of arguments for God instead of showing us evidence.  And there's a reason arguments for God could be used to argue for practically any other religion or phenomenon.  But that's a lot to unpack right now.  4.  How do you account for testimonials from other religions?  This flows pretty naturally from question 3 in that both ask Christians to think about whether the things that reinforce their beliefs don't reinforce other religious beliefs as well.  More than arguments for God, Christian belief is based on testimonials, which can include anything from the classic Christian idea of a testimony, you know, the story of what they were like as a believer, how they came to Christ, and how their life was changed afterward, as well as anecdotes of times they believed supernatural things happened.  In conversations with believers I grew up with, I often run into tales of how they were about to get hurt but felt themselves mysteriously brushed away from danger, or how they spoke to demons and cast them out of people or whatever.  And I'm convinced these stories are usually told by people who honestly believe.  So breaking down the logic of what actually happened and pointing out ways they might be mistaken can get really personal, depending on the story.  But here's the thing.  People from religions all around the world have similar experiences that sound just as convincing, feel just as real to them, and carry just as much personal and emotional meaning.  Their lives were changed by religion.  They've seen miracles or come face to face with their culture's version of supernatural evil.  They feel they have a relationship with their deity.  And many express these ideas with the same level of conviction as a Christian in close to the same terms.  So do they not deserve the same respect as Christian testimonies?  Should they be given less benefit of the doubt?  If testimonies lend credibility to Christianity, do they not do the same for other religions?  And in the end, what differentiates Christian anecdotes from other anecdotes?  Really thinking about these questions can open up a huge can of worms, since testimonials are a huge part of what validates faith in the mind of the average Christian.  And while they won't prove Christianity wrong, they show that testimonials do little if anything to set Christianity apart from any other set of supernatural claims.  The core point here is that promoting its own testimonies while hiding believers from those of other religions creates the illusion that Christians have a body of experience shared by nobody else, not only making them feel a false confidence in their faith, but minimizing the beliefs and experiences of others.  Hopefully getting a Christian to think about this will at least shed some light on the false certainty they get from testimonies, as well as giving them a better understanding of, and respect for, people of other religions with whom they actually have a lot in common.  Number five, where did you get your understanding of atheists?  Now this one might sound self-absorbed, concerned more with perception of us than with a Christian's experience.  it is a legitimate and valuable question.  It addresses core issues of how Christians build their understanding of others and it's key for them to think about if they're really seeking to converse with atheists.  In my experience, very few Christians have interacted with openly identifying atheists, so pretty much their entire idea of us and of atheism comes from things they've learned within Christianity.  And of course you know what most of it sounds like.  We are generally depraved, we deny God because we want to sin, we think the universe came from nothing, we have no basis for morality, and so on.  In my experience, this solidifies many Christians' understanding of who we are before they ever talk to us, to the extent that I've often found myself unable to get someone to hear my actual position once I've explained it.  So it would be helpful if, in a constructive and friendly way, you ask a Christian what they think about atheists and where they got those ideas.  If, upon reflection, they realize they learned most of it from other believers or from the Bible, they will hopefully be willing to rebuild most of their understanding by conversing with, you know, you and other atheists.  Of course, this will be a process, it may have its ups and downs, and it depends on the openness of the person you're speaking with.  Number six, have you ever felt the presence of God?  If so, what does it feel like and how do you distinguish it from the emotional or calming experiences that accompany music or meditation?  Many evangelicals would say that they're not in a religion and that they instead have a relationship with God.  So this being the case, they must interact with him, and this interaction largely comes in the form of feeling his presence, depending, of course, on the denomination, church, and person.  In fact, God's presence is what defines his existence and personality for many of them.  To the extent that it's said you can argue apologetics all day long, but in the end you can't explain away the experience of God.  And honestly I wouldn't try, because doing so verges on trying to tell Christians what they think and feel inside, which is as disrespectful and unconstructive as Christians trying to tell us why we're atheists and won't often get a conversation anywhere.  Instead you might ask what exactly happens when they feel God's presence, just taking their own internal experience for what it is.  What do they actually feel during times of prayer or worship?  Is it a warm feeling?  A sense of peace?  Of clarity?  If there's anything more, what is it?  Depending on what they say, you might ask what convinces them that the experience is or comes from God and how much.  they might just label the experience based on what they've already learned about Christianity.  Of course, there are all kinds of shortcuts a person can use to cope with these questions, but to whatever extent a Christian openly ponders them, there's a good chance it will get them to notice similarities between experiencing God's presence and the feelings that accompany musical and meditative experiences.  In light of this, you might also ask what steps the person takes to experience God.  There's usually some preparation that goes into helping conjure God's presence, including setting up the right environment, choosing music sets, bringing yourself into a certain state of mind, surrounding yourself with like-minded people, hearing inspiring words, and so on.  And of course, almost all of these run suspiciously parallel to non-religious exercises that bring people, sometimes including Christians, into similar states of mind.  Of course, it can always be said that these experiences just counterfeit God's presence or are even demonic, so as always, it takes time for Christians to digest these ideas and make what they will of the parallels.  I can't emphasize enough that you need to respect a believer's space and give them room to process their doubts, or not, in their time and way, just as you probably did.  7.  How do you distinguish the voice of God from your own thoughts?  This one is so similar to number six that I'd almost consider them parts of the same question, but they are a significant enough difference that I thought it was worth treating them separately.  Whereas, feeling God's presence often just amounts to emotional communion with God and assurances with you and not much more needs to come of it, thinking you've actually heard directions from God is a totally different animal.  Similar to question six, I'd ask Christians to introspect on what's going on in their heads when they hear God speaking to them.  What preparation do they need to start hearing God's voice?  What does it sound like?  For most Christians, God's voice comes in the form of impressions or suggestions.  It takes preparation to start receiving them, and they're trained to use discernment to sort His voice from their own.  But why would God communicate this way?  If He has important things to say to you and wants to be sure you hear Him correctly, why make you go through this process that has potential for you mistaking your thoughts for His voice and vice versa?  and if discernment enters into the picture, by what process do you filter God's thoughts from your own?  In my experience, Christians are taught to judge whether something is the voice of God by making sure it agrees with their understanding of Scripture, and they're encouraged to take the counsel of older believers, especially older, wiser believers, into account.  It sounds like there's a certain amount of wisdom in this, and I can appreciate how it anchors Christians in the sanity of surrounding voices.  But are you really doing anything other than filtering your own wandering thoughts through a body of existing theology as an exercise in training your own mind to tell you what you already believe, at best spurring random flashes of inspiration that you risk misunderstanding or blowing out of proportion?  Or if not, and this really is the core question, can you describe the difference between this activity and how you hear the voice of God?  Anyway, those are some of the questions I might ask Christians if I had the chance.  I hope talking through this gives you ideas for constructive, respectful ways you can probe these topics with believers in your life.  Using your own personal vocabulary and keeping in mind your relationship with the person you're talking to.  While I'm usually sarcastic about professional and often manipulative apologists, it's important to empathize with and try to understand believers in your life.  After all, many of the people we care about most are Christians, as were many of us at one time.  So try not to lose sight of that, especially when conversations get exasperating.
