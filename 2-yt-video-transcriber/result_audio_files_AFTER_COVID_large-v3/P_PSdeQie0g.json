And I believe every believer has been called to be a conduit.  And you mentioned how every afternoon you spend the afternoon getting yourself out of the way, out of God's way in order to be used from God.  for god that evening how can every christian avail themselves to the anointing and to the word of god the way you do?

            "text": "you know in church we talk about prayer and i'd like to talk about prayer for a moment please.  we have two statements that people make.  one is i have a prayer life.  The other is, and the saints of old said this, the world changers said this, I have a life of prayer.  The person who has a prayer life designates a certain part of their busy day to go and pray.  Person with a life of prayer designates a portion of their busy time of prayer to do life.  It's really interesting.  When Paul said, pray without ceasing, I am certain he understood that we had to sleep at night, that we had to go to work, that we had to have jobs.  But I think what he was talking about is that we must get to the point where life is interrupting our prayer time and not that our prayer time is interrupting our life.  Meaning, I'm praying all the time.  I'm in an attitude, in a state of prayer all the time.  You know, sometimes a jet is very late.  No matter how much I can plan it, sometimes a flight will be canceled, I'm stuck in an airport, and I get to the church that I'm preaching in, or the crusade venue I'm preaching in, only moments before I'm supposed to preach.  I can't rely on an afternoon where I was alone with God.  What I rely on is the fact that I never broke that communion at all.  So as Paul told Timothy, to be instant in season and out of season.  And I think that's really what needs to happen.  We need to rediscover prayer to the point where i don't know if i want to leave this room in order to go do life because i'm not ready yet and that's exactly what martin luther said.  he said i have so much to do today that i can't begin it without four hours of prayer.  and and i think that that As much as I love my brothers and sisters in the Lord, and I certainly don't want in this video to sound like I'm anti-pastor, I'm not.  I think there are a handful of men and women that have been real traitors.  But by and large, pulpits in America, they're God-fearing, sacrificing men and women who love their people, who do anything for them, and didn't buy into the skinny jeans, big screens, and fog machine version.  and they paid a desperate price for it.  yes some of them have lost people but you know what i have a word of encouragement for them.  it's going to turn because america's appetite is turning and the the person who is in search of a good cup of coffee in a 12-minute sermon with valet parking is is a dinosaur.  They're going to be replaced by, I don't need coffee because I'm wide awake.  I don't care how long you preach, Pastor, because you're turning me from a confused person into a soldier fit for war.  Pastor, you're making me armed and dangerous for my community and the works of the devil.  And I think the appetite is changing.  So I would tell every pastor, hold on just a little bit longer.  Don't compromise the blood, the cross, the second coming of Christ.  Don't sacrifice the baptism in the Holy Spirit, signs, wonders, and miracles done according to the Spirit of God.  And most of all, preach holiness.  Because without that, no one will see God.  And I truly believe at this hour that God has placed a tremendous burden on me to speak what he says when I hear it.  And I'm gonna mention one thing, and I know I'm going long on this answer.  No, go ahead.  But you know, scientists discovered some years ago that the current of electricity that runs through your house is far more powerful than we ever imagined.  And that an electric current at a certain temperature below zero, way below zero, begins to superconduct, meaning that at room temperature there's a drag on electric current.  Well, if you use that as an analogy for the anointing, when a vessel of God dies to self, they remove the drag that's on the anointing.  When we witness in history women like Kathryn Kuhlman, a man like Oral Roberts, We look at healing evangelists and we wonder why some operated on such a seemingly different plane of power than others.  Well, they learned to superconduct and allow the anointing not to be dragged by an axe to grind in the pulpit, a personal viewpoint, a hidden agenda to make money or to be famous.  They simply wanted to please the Holy Spirit.  And in that obsession, they superconducted.  The anointing flowed freely.  That's my obsession.  know when i get in the tent and i begin to preach to lost souls and i hear that a parent brought a child dying of leukemia or a man with children has had multiple heart attacks and maybe won't live through the next few months and instead of relying solely on doctors they come to my tent.  that places an awesome responsibility on me, not to believe I can heal them, but to believe that I can get out of God's way.  And see, when I wrote the book, Vessels of Fire and Glory, there was one outstanding grief that I felt at a certain part of the book when I was writing it.  I grieved over the Holy Spirit.  because it said do not quench the spirit and that word grieve don't hurt him.  we've broken his heart.  I began to see how he was insulted marginalized misrepresented reduced to some new age force.  this God head the Holy Spirit was wounded and hurt by our behavior.  Because Jesus emphatically stated, it's to your advantage that I leave.  It's for your sake that I must go away because otherwise the helper can't come.  And we've rejected that help.  We thought we knew how to preach better.  Billy Graham said that it amazed him how the preaching of the simple gospel and the truth of it, that the Spirit of God would drive it into the hearts of men everywhere he went.  We got to let the Holy Spirit take over again.  He knows how to handle the virus.  He knows how to handle the government.  He knows what we ought to be saying.  And you know, when I began writing the blog and I worked on this book and I began speaking out as I am today, I said, Lord, you can't anoint me to do that.  You can anoint me to do ministry, but why?  And it was found in second... In 1 Samuel 10, verse 6, the Spirit of the Lord will come upon you and you will prophesy with them and be changed into another man.  And let it be that when these signs come to you, that you do as the occasion demands, for God is with you.  The kind of things that I'm saying in this hour would have been inappropriate even 10 years ago.  but this is what the occasion demands and that's why pastor let the anointing have its way begin to speak the message.  that is not the the line of your denomination necessarily.  it's not the tradition that you're used to.  it's from the word of god but it's a focus on exposing the evil of the swamp and the power of God to overcome it and bring America back to God.

And for church leaders that are watching, and those of you that are watching right now, did you hear that word?  There's a turning coming.  You need to share this with every church leader, with every pastor that you know, so they can receive this refreshing and receive this word.  Brother Mario, when you pray for us, And those of you that are watching, hang on because I want to share something with you.  I've got an exciting announcement for you.  I don't want you to miss.  So hang in there with us.  But how many of you watching right now are hungry for the Holy Spirit?  Write down in the comments and just write and let me and Brother Mario know that you're hungry for the Holy Spirit.  And we're going to pray for you and believe God with you for a fresh touch of the Holy Spirit of God.  Brother Mario, would you pray for us and particularly for the pastors that are watching? ",

We can't lose this gift.  And the stupidest reason ever to cripple our children with socialism would be because they were too afraid that they couldn't succeed without the government being their nursemaid.  God, I pray for an awakening.  I pray that common house cats will turn back into lions.  I pray that a fire will be ignited in the heart of everyone listening.  Those who have been called by you to preach your gospel in a pulpit as a pastor.  Help them to see their duty.  Help them to understand that safety is in obedience and not in escape.  If we're in rebellion against God, if God has told us to speak out, there'll be nowhere to run and nowhere to hide unless we obey the Lord.  Jonah discovered that when he was told to go to Nineveh and refused and went in the opposite direction.  god let us run toward the truth and not away from it.  give us the courage to speak out in an hour when thieves are robbing us of our rights and our freedoms.  lord let us be turned into a new vessel of god And do what the occasion demands in the name of Jesus.
