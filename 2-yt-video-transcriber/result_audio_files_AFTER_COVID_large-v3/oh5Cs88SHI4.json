Biologists speak about the landscape of biological designs.  By that, they don't mean all the biological objects.  They mean all the possibilities for rearranging DNA, all the possibilities.  That's what the landscape is.  But possibilities by themselves are not enough.  We need to create those objects.  It's like having a whole bunch of blueprints for houses, but you have to have something to build the houses.  What was it in biology?  Well, it was Darwinian evolution.  acting on a bunch of carbon, oxygen, and so forth, eventually filled out this enormous landscape of possibilities and created a biosphere of very, very great diversity.

You have to go back a dozen years or so to what physicists thought about these anthropic ideas.  They thought of them as being religious.  They thought of them as being the statement, the world is the way it is because God made it so that people could exist.  Physicists don't like to explain things that way.  They want hard-nosed equations.  They want hard-nosed explanations based on the laws of science and so forth.  So they were very, very... I would almost say angry.  There was almost an anger at this idea that the universe was somehow made for us to live in.  That... How shall I call it?  That mindset... was the mindset about the anthropic principle, let us say, 10, 12 years ago.  It just rankled against physicists' objectivity to introduce something as personal as saying the world was made for us to exist in and live in.  But as time went on, they found it less and less and less possible to explain the world as we see it.  And new kinds of explanations evolved which were not religious in the least.  They depended on this enormous diversity, but they had in the back of their mind always that there was some supernatural aspect to it.  The other thing was ambition.  I don't mean personal ambition.  I mean the ambition of the field.  The ambition of the field was to explain every single fact of nature the constants of nature, the particles of nature.  The hope was that we would be able to use our equations to explain every single feature of nature.  And that just conflicted with the idea that nature could be enormously diverse.  It is almost as if at one time biologists had the ambition to predict exactly what a human being was like from the microscopic laws of chemistry.  Well, that didn't happen.  That's not the way it worked.  A human being could have had three ears.  He could have had two noses.  All kinds of differences could have been inherent in the DNA.  And the biologists, had they had that ambition, would have been frustrated.  Some of them might have even gotten angry and said, oh, it can't be that way.  That's kind of what happened.  The ambition of physics to explain everything uniquely by some fundamental, mathematical, beautiful laws, elegant laws, got frustrated.  And so for a period of time, physicists didn't reject, they resisted this.  I would say that by now, there's been a reversal of fortune.  Most physicists recognize if you were to hold a gun to their head and say, explain to me the fine tunings of nature, and if you don't give me the right explanation, I'm going to pull the trigger.  Or you're going to say God did it. ",

On the other hand, we're all unhappy that our ambitions have been frustrated.  So some people, myself included incidentally, would say it's too early to give up the ambition But it's not too early to start to think about the other possibilities.
