            "text": "Hello and welcome back to No Bullshit.  Today we return to talking about the video game The Last of Us Part II.  Lots of controversy and new news coming out about this one after there were some big leaks over the past weekend.  Now we've already talked about the leaks and the story pretty extensively.  The recap basically goes like this.  There was a disgruntled employee at the company, Naughty Dog, who makes this game.  Naughty Dog has been known to crunch their employees and overwork them and sometimes not pay them if they've done something wrong.  This employee in question had some of those issues and decided that since he wasn't getting paid enough, he just shared all this footage of The Last of Us.  This has ruined the ending, all the story elements, gameplay, all of it's been out there now.  And what we've discovered was... this game is SJW as hell.  It's got woke written all over it.  It's going to be a classic get woke, go broke situation because not only does the game have this lesbian love story at the forefront, it's being led by Ellie, who's an alphabet character, but also there's another alphabet looking character who has killed our favorite main character, Joel, and it's turned it into this whole progressive baloney.  It's a mess.  It's been terrible but kind of fun to watch.  it's interesting because a lot of people are already getting refunds saying they won't buy the game.  it's caused Sony and Naughty Dog to announce a new release date.  it was actually delayed before this happened but now they're like hurry up get it out.  we're coming out with it.  in June.  we got to release this thing before people just totally pull away.  now that's where we've been up until today and over time people have started to notice a few things.  not only were the leaks super woke and and pretty expected, since we had some telltale signs early on, like whenever they premiered this at E3 with the lesbian kiss, and then there was Troy Baker, the actor, who said this thing was going to have a weird ending, have an open mind, and now we see what they were talking about.  But in the aftermath, in the after show, we've got some new developments to talk about, too.  First, we've got a story about why they've made certain characters certain ways, and eventually we're going to get to one of our famous, most... hated SJWs of all time.  Anita Sarkeesian appears to play a role in this.  She apparently had influenced some of these game makers that worked at Naughty Dog, and they had listened to Anita Sarkeesian's terrible videos.  She has this show called Feminist Frequency.  If you hadn't heard, Anita Sarkeesian is like one of the original Gamergate era SJW types.  She came out in like 2014, 2015, real early on with this SJW stuff, and she had a big fundraiser talking about how she's going to save the video game industry by... talking about how everything's racist and sexist.  That's essentially what she does.  She does videos.  No one watches them anymore, by the way.  She's totally irrelevant at this point.  She's been dead memed for almost a couple years now, but she still comes up.  It's still interesting to mention her here because she gets mentioned in an article, which we'll get to later, where she influenced Naughty Dog to act like this.  She talked to them all the way back in 2013, 2014, when the first Last of Us game came out and appears to have influenced things along the way.  So, all that's going to go over today and more.  Very exciting.  But first, let's get to this first story because I find this one very interesting.  This one comes from Sausage Roll and it says, Now, this goes back to this character here.  This is the one that's become pretty infamous since these leaks.  This is the one person that kills Joel and they appear to be like trans or something.  We don't know for sure.  I don't know the details myself.  I don't know if it's spelled out in the game, but it definitely looks like they're like a Tom girl at the least, but possibly trans at the most.  And according to this article, Naughty Dog made female characters less feminine to be trans friendly.  And this is pretty interesting because if you look at the way they make cartoons and stuff in other countries, like no one is going down this route.  Like America for some reason went down the wrong street.  We're in the, we're in the terrible part of town because we can't have pretty girls in our media anymore.  I mean, this is something we've seen over the years too.  We've talked about in movies.  We've talked about it in TV shows.  First example comes to mind is Captain Marvel had this going on.  Captain Marvel was played by Brie Larson, who is usually a pretty good looking girl.  She's pretty.  She's got blonde hair, good figure, all that stuff.  But for some reason, they dressed her down in Captain Marvel.  They gave her this really bulky suit.  She wasn't allowed to be pretty because that's the new feminist angle these days.  They don't want you to supposedly kind of.  For now though, let's see what this article has to say.  New screenshots reveal that all the female characters in The Last of Us Part II have been made to look more androgynous, allegedly to not offend trans women.  Naughty Dog and Sony are currently having a terrible week after a disgruntled employee leaked the entire game online, especially considering that the majority of folk hate the direction the new writers took the story and now they are facing heat for what they've done to female characters.  Yeah, would it be such a crime to have a pretty girl in a video game?  What happened to the Tomb Raider days?  Those used to be fun.  Last of Us Part II leaks are reported to come from a disgruntled Naughty Dog employee over a payment dispute.  A source connected to the studio explained that, although they believe the leak came from an employee, it may be about a little more than a pay dispute.  I don't doubt even for a moment that this leak came from the studio.  The Last of Us Part II is very divisive and, as you can imagine, some of the team aren't really thrilled to be working on the game, a source told Arena Rose moments after the gameplay footage leaked.  Okay, this is pretty interesting too because this is the first time I've heard of another angle.  Like, they weren't just mad about payment and getting overworked.  They were mad about this game being dumb and having a terrible story.  Now, that's something I can understand after we've seen these leaks and we've talked about some of the other plot points and how it's gone bad.  I can understand working on a game for so long and putting all your crunch time into it and only to find out it's really terrible.  So, it sounds like there's some other... things going on here.  The leak confirms some extremely divisive and partisan plot devices and now many former fans are washing their hands of what they're describing as clear political agenda being pushed by Neil Druckmann and new writers at Naughty Dog.  Naughty Dog built their reputation upon the success of the Uncharted trilogy, one of the most critically acclaimed and fan-loved gaming series of all time.  The game owed a lot of its success due to Amy Hennig's vision, direction, and writing.  Unfortunately, Hennig was forced out of Naughty Dog by Druckmann due to creative disputes.  Well, again, that makes sense because it appears Uncharted was the last of the non-political era video games.  It came from a different time, although the last fourth entry came out in 2016.  That was a groundbreaking year.  Things have changed a lot since 2016.  Everything's political now, and everything has to be SJW-focused.  female centered, girls can't be pretty, all that stuff, it's all getting wrapped up in this company which makes sense too because a lot of video game companies are like this and Naughty Dog of all places, it is based in California.  So next this article, I'm gonna skip over and try to get to the later quotes.  but Next, this article talks about a few things we briefly mentioned before.  First of all, the Uncharted 4 started to have these sort of SJW elements in it.  First, coming from the Nadine character, which was this unstoppable badass girl who also appeared in the Uncharted spinoff, The Lost Legacy, which had two female characters leading in an Uncharted game.  they had some sort of romance kind of hinted at between them.  I'm not sure that was just like people shipping them or possibly in the game, but that was when Naughty Dog first started to go SJW.  And then they followed that up with a Last of Us edition, which was actually featured two girls in love, Ellie and Riley.  They're the lesbian couple that appears in the Last of Us Part II as well.  So this trend started around then, and that's why it led to where we are today.  It's gotten real out of control.  Neil Druckmann has taken over, and now we're seeing disgruntled employees leaking stuff because it's gotten so bad.  Here, the article talks about making these characters in Last of Us less feminine, which is part of the premise of this.  It's about being less pretty, less sexualized, and more... androgynous like that character we saw at the top.  You could see Ellie used to be a bit of a more cute girl, and now in the new game, she's looking more angry, more masculine, more male, just like this character over here on the side.  So the artist confirms this.  This is other people talking about it, and it really makes you worry about the future of Naughty Dog Games.  I know a lot of people are already abandoning the company, and for good reason.  I mean, I would be upset too.  This isn't something I wanted to see.  I enjoyed Last of Us.  I enjoyed all of Uncharted.  I didn't really... It didn't really ruin me with the stuff that happened in Uncharted 4, but I feel like if they did Uncharted 6, it would be all girls again.  I mean, they already did an all-girl one, and in addition to the end of Uncharted 4, they had Uncharted's main characters have a daughter, so it seemed like the daughter might spin off into her own games.  That's not necessarily bad.  Like, I love Tomb Raider games, but one of the cool things about female leads in a lot of good places, they would still let them be sexy and beautiful and Awesome, like I. don't know why they can't be good-looking anymore But that's the world we're living in today And I think a lot of it has to do with honestly like a lot of these SJWs are just jealous and they don't like good-looking girls So they try to make everyone look less good-looking like themselves.  because have you ever seen these SJWs?  Have you ever seen a pretty SJW like besides the ones in actors in the media like supporting them for political reasons?  I mean most the time they're terrible.  And speaking of terrible SJWs, let's get to the second story that I hinted at earlier.  This one talks about Anita Sarkeesian talking about exposing gaming's most toxic trends with sheer data.  Now, this is a very misleading title and we're obviously not going to be siding with that hack, but She tries to pretend she's doing this technical, scientific research when she does these feminist frequency videos, and she's like, oh, I'm exposing the sexism because I counted how many girls were in how many scenes in this game.  It's like, oh, I'm exposing how many times a guy hooks up with a girl in a game.  She counts things out, but she's not really putting the context on things.  These are like artistic endeavors.  You can't just count how many roles are in each thing and expect to have legitimate data.  I mean, that's what they're trying to do.  They're trying to pretend... This data is serious and awesome and scientific, but if it was, there would be actual smart people handling this and studying this, but it's not.  It's Anita Sarkeesian.  She went to Cal State Northridge.  She's like a B-level student at best, has no degrees in science or research or anything professional.  She's some kind of reporting student.  So this has nothing to do with anything, but... That's all besides the point.  Let's get to the Naughty Dog quotes here because this is where it gets interesting.  Beyond anecdotal and off-the-record stories about her videos being used at game studios, Sarkeesian confirms that Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann and Arkane's Harvey Smith have spoken about the insights they've gleaned from feminist frequency videos and used in their later games.  In Arkane's case... Dishonored 1 was awful to women, like, in every way is so bad, Sarkeesian says.  While I loved that game, I was very vocal about how bad that was.  And so were many other people.  Arkane heard that and they were like, damn, we messed up.  And then they fixed it in future Dishonored games.  And The Last of Us Expansion Pack Left Behind pops up in Petit's new series as a positive example of three-dimensional representation of a queer relationship within an action game.  The international attention that trope versus women got allowed a conversation to happen in games that was previously only happening in the shadows, Sarkeesian says.  And it allowed space for more and more women and marginalized folks to start talking about what it means to be a fan of games, to make games, and yet to not see yourself represented in games.  We can see today the progress that was made from that point, which again, is not that long ago.  Okay, well, I would say settle down there, lady.  I think she's just getting a little... high on her own supply.  if you ask me because I don't think Anita changed anything I think she's trying to justify her existence and she's a little insecure because her videos are pointless and people don't even watch them now.  you could go to her channel now and she hides the ratings and comments.  I mean I think she has a few views here and there.  I'm not trying to view.  shame anyone.  I'm not saying I get a million more views or anything, but I'm just saying she's irrelevant.  No one cares about her anymore.  She's just some big complainer who had one big fundraiser and ripped a bunch of people off years ago just so she could cry sexism and call these games racist.  It's a classic case of SJWs calling everyone out, calling everyone names, thinking it makes them relevant, and apparently... this is what's influenced the people behind The Last of Us Part II.  That brings it back full circle.  We're talking about these leaks and we're talking about how SJW things have got.  And I think Anita Sarkeesian can be given a little credit for influencing that.  Now, she was just part of a greater system, a greater movement of this country getting more politically correct, more pro-women, more anti-men.  That's what's happening on a grander scale.  But she was a small part of that.  Granted, she's not relevant anymore, but it's worth pointing out and seeing the source of the problems here.  This is how The Last of Us got pretty messed up.  They decided to listen to idiots like Anita Sarkeesian.  Thanks for your time today, guys.  Make sure you comment your thoughts on everything below.
