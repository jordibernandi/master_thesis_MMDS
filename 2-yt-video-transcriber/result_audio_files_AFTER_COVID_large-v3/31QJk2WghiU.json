            "text": "Praise be Jesus Christ.  I want to read to you a scripture from Deuteronomy.  The Lord says, I set before you here this day a blessing and a curse.  A blessing for obeying the commandments of the Lord your God, which I enjoin on you today.  a curse if you do not obey the commandments of the Lord your God, but turn aside from the way I ordained for you today to follow other gods whom you have not  known.\".  Now, this morning I released a video.  I read Archbishop Jose Gomez, the president of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, the USCCB statement on the inauguration of Joe Biden.  I commented, I said this statement was clear.  and courageous.  A lot of people freaked out.  There were two main complaints.  People were saying this is too little, too late.  And a lot of people were saying we need clarity on whether or not Joe Biden is a Catholic in good standing because of the things he is pushing.  Now, I've already dealt with those questions in other videos.  I don't want to get into them today.  But I do want to just highlight what Archbishop, the good Archbishop, wrote that is so clear.  And that took courage because he received resistance from high levels in the church to publish this letter, apparently.  So he wrote, I must point out that our new president has pledged to pursue certain policies that would advance moral evils and threaten human life and dignity, most seriously in the areas of a marriage and gender and we're seeing the executive orders being signed now.  scary stuff scary stuff where we're headed.  he goes on to write abortion remains the preeminent priority and he also wrote check this out this.  this should have been clearly highlighted for a long time not just after the election.  he wrote.  we cannot stay silent when nearly a million unborn lives are being cast aside in our country year after year through abortion.  Brothers and sisters, let's pray for this world.  We're in a moral nosedive.  Let's implore the Lord's mercy and support people who are speaking up for what is true.  Viva Cristo! ",
