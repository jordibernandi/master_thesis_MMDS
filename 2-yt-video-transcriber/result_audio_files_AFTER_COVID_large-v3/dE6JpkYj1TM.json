            "text": "I want to welcome you to this special update.  I'm going to be sharing with you something that happened to me.  It would have been very early Monday morning.  I was in a very, very deep sleep.  I had got up.  And gone to the restroom, got a drink of water, and then come back and laid back down.  And just immediately went into what I call, and the Bible would identify as something termed a vision.  Now, there is a difference between a dream and a vision.  I think everyone... watching me at some point or another dreams.  I'm a person that dreams every night.  Now, that doesn't mean anything other than probably 98 to 99% of what I dream is just that.  It is a dream.  Occasionally, the Lord gives you a spiritual dream in which there is biblical symbolism.  USED IN THAT DREAM, AND IT CAN BE INTERPRETED BY GOING BACK TO THE SCRIPTURE, WHETHER IT BE THE OLD OR NEW TESTAMENT, AND INTERPRETING THE SYMBOLISM.  A SERPENT IS ALWAYS DANGER OR TROUBLE OR AN INDIVIDUAL CAUSING TROUBLE.  Or a flock of sheep is the church or individual believers.  Goats happen to be people who are causing difficulties.  Vicious dogs are often evil spirits and so on and so forth.  A vision, on the other hand, takes on a more... a clarity that is different than a dream.  For example, in a vision you can taste, the sounds are very, you're very alerted to sounds, you're very alerted to the colors.  It's very much as though it is unfolding right there at that moment.  What was very interesting is in this particular vision that I had, I knew I was having a vision.  I was in the actual vision saying, OK, I'm experiencing a vision.  Let's let's walk this through.  And it's like I was in the vision itself saying to myself, you know, don't wake up.  Stay in this and let's see what this is referring to or what this could mean.  It's been a long time actually since I've had something that I would classify a vision.  So this to me was very unique and because it has pressed my spirit very heavily and I can't get away from it.  This is how I know it is somehow a word from the Holy Spirit.  In this particular vision, I suddenly found myself in a building that appeared to be a very large estate.  I do not know where this estate was located.  For some reason, when I looked out over this balcony, It could have been in the state of California.  And the reason I'm saying that is because I have traveled to California.  I've been to Hollywood, Malibu, Los Angeles, Orange County, San Francisco during years of ministry.  And it looked like some of the mountains that you would find in the Southern California area.  And I'm not saying it was California.  I'm saying that the mountain area appeared to be as though it could be California.  But all of a sudden, as I'm walking across this very beautiful balcony of this, what appeared to be a very large home in an estate, I looked to my right and there was a river.  And right across from the river, there was an orange glow just filling up the air and the atmosphere in the upper heavens.  And I knew that was not normal.  And as I look closer, it was a burning fire and this fire was just raging.  And this was not a fire which we would consider to be the normal fires that California experiences where the woods are burning or the mountains are burning.  This one had purposely been set and it was being set to buildings and homes and businesses.  And of course, we have seen this happen in the past, but this one was different.  And then I noticed that there was a flag being waved by.  almost looked like to me.  it could have been a Mexican flag.  I've seen the Mexican flag.  And again, I'm not saying it was.  I wasn't close enough to it, but the various colors and the emblem could have been that.  And someone was holding up that flag.  I then went inside this home.  And as I went inside, it was a very large room.  It was a very secure room.  It had, I'm going to estimate probably 15 or 20 bedrooms in it.  It had kitchens.  It was just, as I said, some type of an estate.  All of a sudden, people began to appear.  Some of them were just carrying belongings.  Some of them had one suitcase.  And they began to say, we need protection.  We need safety.  We need to come in here.  We need help.  And I remember thinking to myself that something has happened.  And these are common people.  who live somewhere in this area who are so afraid that they're trying to get out of their homes and get away from their neighborhoods to move to places and to be secure in areas where they could kind of join together, but yet they really had no place to go.  And it's as though they were searching out this large estate to kind of hide out on or be protected in.  And I remember all of a sudden looking out and here came a carload and here came another car and here came people walking.  And they suddenly started overwhelming this place.  Now, whoever was over this estate became afraid of these people and actually had firearms and started shooting at the ground, but it wasn't stopping.  And one woman in particular was almost in a state of complete shock.  And she was screaming and running toward the owner.  And I'm thinking, he's going to shoot her and kill her.  Oh, my Lord, this poor woman.  It's like she was out of her mind.  She'd had some kind of a breakdown.  And I remember seeing some African-American people.  There were A few Hispanic people.  These were mostly mostly Caucasian folks that were pouring into this building trying to find help.  And again, whoever the owner of the house was, he was saying, I cannot let these people just invade this.  And and who's going to feed them?  and where's their food going to come from?  and how are they going to.  They have nothing.  They have no idea.  bed sheets of their own.  They have no pillars of their own.  And then there was an announcement made.  There were a few were allowed in, but they would have to bring in their own supplies to be able to stay there.  In other words, they couldn't depend on the owner of the house to take care of them.  And I asked a person suddenly, I said, folks, stop, stop, listen to me.  What in the world is going on?  And something had happened in the United States and it specifically was affecting this part of the country to where people had absolutely gone totally mad.  There were mobs that were moving into what we call the common areas, not so much just the downtown cities that we have seen in the past, but they were moving into the suburb areas and they were literally taking over people's homes, home invasions.  And I'm not talking about two or three people.  This was like hundreds of people at one time.  And it had panicked the people so bad that they had nowhere to go.  I didn't see any police force there.  I didn't see any police protecting anyone.  And I'm not sure as to why that would be so.  Maybe there was a reason for that.  Maybe it was just that I didn't see them.  But it was a time of complete and utter chaos.  Now, I came out of that and, you know, of course, was greatly troubled by what I had seen and what had taken place.  And I went into then a dream, a follow up dream in which there were a lot of different people on buses.  Some of them were Christian people.  Some of them were.  It happened to be near a border area.  Again, this could have been Texas.  It could have been California.  It could have been Arizona.  I'm not sure.  But it was in a border state because there was a lot of Mexican people that were kind of mingled in with the particular groups that were on the buses.  And again, people were basically.  this is this one is a little bit hard to describe because of the details.  In fact, in the dream.  I actually did not have on me any identification.  I did not have on me any kind of money.  And I literally asked a person sitting beside me on a bus, I said, ma'am, if you'll give me your address, I will mail you money later.  I have absolutely no income.  And I remember I was quite confused because I was thinking, OK, I've just left a station with a busload of people, just buses of people here.  But I don't even know where I am.  I don't even know where Pam is, where she is staying.  And there was just a sense for me of a lot of confusion.  Now, I don't take, if I can say this very carefully, I don't take stock in every dream I have because I have so many dreams that it could be nothing and it could have an implication to something.  But the one that troubles me the most It's when I have a vision, because every time that I've ever experienced a vision, whether it was the World Trade Center being attacked, shrouded in black, or it was the oil tornado that many of you heard me talk about years ago, that we know was the oil rig that blew up underground outside of Louisiana.  And I even knew the state where it was going to happen.  And we could go through other visions that we've had over the years.  You know, the one of Hillary Clinton in the in the yellow pantsuit and three tornadoes coming behind her, which happened with her when she ran against President Trump.  That's a whole other story, but it was a vision, was not a dream.  So in the visions that I have, at times we see these come to pass, not necessarily immediately, but over months or sometimes over a couple years.  So I do sense in my spirit, not just from having this, but since in my spirit with the division that is in the United States and how that the country is literally half of them acknowledge.  And I do believe there was definitely fraud in this election.  This fraud is serious.  And the election was stolen.  Real interesting.  All the other states, everything's fine.  It's just the battleground states that Trump needed to win where the problems came from.  Isn't that interesting?  All the other states.  countered their vote and it came in, you know, as should be.  But then the other group that is going ahead and making plans to take over the White House and selecting committees and this kind of thing, this division will not go away.  If President Trump does not win these lawsuits, then Biden becomes president and he becomes the commander in thief.  The 70 to 80,000 people will never accept him as president.  I'm sorry, million people will will never accept him as president, especially if they can prove these machines turn votes over, which they did.  It's not fake news.  They did.  They've tested this and proven this already in several states.  how the machines, because it's a computer, it can be tracked down if you know what you're doing.  There's going to be a split.  Now, whether or not we know that if the left would lose, there's going to be absolute enormous riots and burning of the cities without a doubt.  This was something that I saw way back in the year 2000.  It was a very clear vision.  And we have a little YouTube video that I shared that with people with some pictures that were drawn out.  And if President Trump loses, although there may not be violent protests, I believe we're going to see a lot of protest and confusion.  And I'm going to do a video on... on what if the election was stolen?  How would the Lord, how could that happen?  How does God not prevent that from happening?  Or how is man involved with that?  Is Satan involved with that?  And there's all kinds of questions that people have.  And I'm not answering this for a secular audience.  I'm answering this because probably the 450,000 There are 60,000 people that keep up with our YouTube channel, attend church occasionally or quite often in most places and are believers.  So we have a selective audience that we're dealing with here.  But I do want to say to you that this has burdened me and has troubled me.  And I think that we need to... to be in prayer and ask God for wisdom, knowledge and understanding of the times in which we're living in and how to react and respond to those times.  And I believe that the prayer is going to be very key not only with what we're seeing happen now and praying this through one way or the other.  But it's also going to be very, very significant in the days ahead that we're coming into in the next, should the Lord tarry for the next several years.  And so I just had to kind of get this burden off of me and get this off my chest a little bit and ask you to agree with me in prayer that whatever is out there that the Lord knows and he's letting us be maybe forewarned in advance, that people will have the wisdom and knowledge and understanding to know what to do, how to prepare, and how to make it through these times.  You know, I heard a minister say years ago, tough times don't always last, but tough people do.  And the American people who are believers who know how to pray are very strong people.  And we've gone through many things.  We've gone through the days of Hitler, World War I, World War II, the Vietnam War.  We've gone through the 9-11 attacks.  We've gone through so many things.  Now we're in the middle of this virus, global virus pandemic.  And God is with us and he's not going to forsake us.  And that's the... positive word that I want to leave with you.  I'll never leave you nor forsake you even to the end.  And I will go with you always, even into the end.  So please be encouraged in that today.  And again, follow us on YouTube.  We have some more.  I'm just kind of meditating on how I want to share the next video with you this week.  And I'm kind of waiting for a direction from the Spirit of God on how to word it.
