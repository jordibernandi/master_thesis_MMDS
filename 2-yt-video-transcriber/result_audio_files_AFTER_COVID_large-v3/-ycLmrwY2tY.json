            "text": "Welcome to another episode of Redeeming Truth.  This one will not be controversial at all.  The question is, why do we here at our church and in our convictions not sing or direct people to Bethel music, Jesus culture, Hillsong, Elevation Worship with Stephen Furtick, and all those like-minded movements?  While we are grateful for the zeal and the passion of some of these ministries, the well-intentioned, seemingly well-intentioned drive to reach people and to reach a culture and to reach a generation.  You know, you guys can speak to this.  Passion, while it's essential, we want to be passionate.  Goodness, you got to be passionate about the truth and about something in life where you'll just kind of live this mundane existence.  Passion can be essential, but it's not always reliable.  Speak to that for for a quick minute as we start here. ",

If we're worshiping the wrong Jesus, we're outside of the grace of God.  So we have to be focused on truth.  And if we're passionate, we have to be passionate about the truth.  And I would take anyone who asks this question to Ephesians 5.  In Ephesians 5, verse 15 and following, it gives us a way to live life.  It says, And go down to a few verses later, it says, making melody to the lord with your heart.  so christians are commanded to sing.  not only that we're commanded to address each other and in fact teach each other through music.  so if our music is being used as a vehicle to teach false doctrine or even doctrine that looks true but is not quite there then we should reject it wholeheartedly because if we're filled with the spirit singing songs we will be filled with songs that sing truth.

            "text": "okay so the Clearly, we've played our cards.  The position would be that these movements are false, teaching false doctrines, that music matters, lyrics matter.  So let me quickly quote things and make sure that we're being fair and accurate.  And then, Dale, I want you to chime in, certainly, based on this.  What Bethel teaches, and Bill Johnson being one of the heads of this movement and what is typically coined now the New Apostolic Reformation, what Todd White teaches and believes, what is spread throughout these areas, conferences in places like The Send and others, They are teaching, based on Philippians 2, 5-7, that Jesus was just a man in right relationship to God.  He was not God when he did his miracles, his signs, his wonders.  He was just a man living like we could now today.  And so, based on that, we can do them too.  And we're supposed to be living this supernatural lifestyle that... Not supernatural as in leading people to Christ, the miracle of salvation, or even just praying for people and seeing God move in remarkable ways.  But actually, supernatural meaning we're prophets, we're apostles, we are healers, we're miracle workers, and going around and doing the like.  And so you know we're being fair.  I want to quote Bill Johnson from page 29 of his book, When Heaven Invades Earth, where he says, Jesus did his miracles, his signs, wonders, as a man in right relationship to God.  And then there's an ellipsis.  not as God.  Later on in the book When Heaven Invades Earth, on page 79, he says these exact words, he laid his divinity aside.  That is Christological heresy.  To use the H word in the realist, literal sense, that is Christological heresy.  You cannot, based on not only the teaching of Scripture, but the Council of Chalcedon, the early church, all the way through the ages even to now, say that Jesus just at any point wasn't God.  He laid aside his divinity.  They base it on Philippians 2.  They say that the kenosis or the emptying of Christ was an emptying of his divinity, his divine nature.  And then he laid that aside as a model to just show us how we could do it too.  I am with R.C.  Sproul when he says Jesus was truly man and truly God.  And other scholars who have said that it was a subtraction by addition.  In other words, it was a humbling or an emptying because he added humanity to who he already was.  Which is basically like God coming down and was saying, I'm going to add puny human to to my repertoire.  I'm going to become one of them. ",

So here's what my conviction would be, and I believe we share this conviction, that if you're going to demean Christ and his divinity, you're going to say that he wasn't actually divine, that now we have a false Jesus.  A false Jesus can't save.  And people say, well, hold on.  You don't know their heart.  You can't judge their heart.  What if they're well-intentioned?  You know what?  Mormons are well-intentioned.  You know that in Islam, there's a Jesus?  In many other false religions, there is a place for Jesus.  So if we're getting Jesus wrong, that Jesus can't save.  And so I don't want to sing about that Jesus.  I don't want to talk about that Jesus.  And I sure don't want to point people to that Jesus.  And so Dale, speak to this.

And when you use like terms like LDS, they use the name of Christ.  And it seems like they're talking about the same Jesus much of the time until you lift the hood up on their theology and what they truly believe.  And this is a very similar situation with NAR.  You have to lift the hood up.  What do they believe?  And when you listen to them in their own words, We're not putting words in anybody's mouth.  In their own words, they are teaching and believing in a different Jesus Christ.  other than the Bible, that's not in the Bible, I should say.  So when they're producing music that seemingly is using the same terms that an orthodox church like ours would use, there's a comfort level to it.  There's a hook to it, like, oh, they're singing about my Lord, until you find out that they're not. ",

I want to add one clarity point here as well is, People will naturally say, and I agree with asking this question, well then why in the world do you guys sing It Is Well With My Soul by Horatio Spafford, who didn't have any doctrine of hell or other things.  There were some serious problems.  And then people kind of get snarky and say, well, there were problems with C.S.  Lewis.  There were problems with this guy and this guy.  Well, I guess they're all heretics.  We better just listen to you guys.  You've got the lock on sound doctrine.  Well, listen.  The reason that we aren't going to point people to this music or sing this music is because these are actively heretical movements.  Singing it is well.  True lyrics, great song.  Singing It Is Well With My Soul is not sending somebody to Bethel Supernatural School of Ministry or Todd White's Lifestyle Christianity.  It's not going to lead people astray.  And we have real stories from people, parents at our church, parents from other churches, parents of college students who come crying because their students have been swept up.  We've seen a lot of people saved out of these movements.  But one of the things, too, we would say is we're not commanding this of other churches or other people.  These are our convictions.  And our convictions do not have to be your commands.  However, we should all fairly understand and clearly understand why people have the positions that they do.  And so we want to continue to make clear that we are not going to sing active heretics and point people to active heresy where they're going to think, you know, you're muddying the water here.  You've got to pay royalties to these people as well with CCLI and some of the legal proceedings now.  And so we don't want to pay money to heresy.  That's right.  And we don't want to partner with it in any way, shape, or form.  That's our conviction. ",

But 20 years ago and for the last 20 years, you refused to buy my uncle's instrumental CD.  You're not playing the Benny Hinn worship CD in your churches.  I've had conservative guys that are even more right, over the right side of things.  that I mean really deeply.  convicted guys over things have told me before, I've heard your Uncle Benny preach better gospel presentations than Baptist preachers.  So it's really not about the fact that these people don't offer anything or that there's nothing truthful in it.  The real question is, what are we going for?  Are we caving to the culture?  Am I letting the radio DJ and the top billboard hits dictate what I sing?  Am I letting my methodological leanings dictate now my theological convictions?  Then sing them all.  Welcome them all in.  Open the doors for everyone.  And live with the conviction all the way.  Take it to its logical conclusion.  And so I don't say that to be snarky or sarcastic.  It's just always been interesting to me that the minute it got cool, the minute it had V-necks and skinny jeans and leather jackets, and it made it into the mainstream, was the minute a whole bunch of churches decided, you know what?  This is what people like.  Kyle, you mentioned pragmatism.  You know what?  Let's do it.  This will grow it.  This will build it.  And all those other guys are just stuck-up theology nerds.  Yeah.
