            "text": "Welcome back.  You're here with Goldberg.  Today I'm going to be talking about something which is in part a request, but I'll probably end up incorporating it into the book on social confidence, which I'm writing concurrently with the version that is associated with World War II.  In this case, it goes as follows.  Dear Dr.  Goldberg, what do you do in the event that you have built some kind of report or vibe with a girl over text message or dating app, you have similar interests.  It is flowing the way you want.  And then she just randomly ceases to respond or communicate.  Should you continue with the interaction and try to reignite the flame?  No, it's not true.  Don't even ask.  I mean, I hate to say it, but you have to realize the situation that you're in.  And frankly, a lot of men are likely to be in given our current state of affairs.  If she does not find you physically attractive, there's two other things you have going for you, particularly on online or text-based communication interaction.  Number one, you're able to communicate that you have a certain level of popularity or social status.  But you've probably already done in your profile.  It's unlikely that that's a trick up your sleeve.  So then it would have to be money.  And I do know a guy, he pulled this off.  He had one of those real badass Dodge V6 Charger cuck wagons.  Yeah, great car, you know, high end.  And there were some women who were just attracted to the car, so that helped him furthering his goals.  But otherwise, if you're not capable of putting out that display, you've got to sort of just face the facts.  Because some dudes, they might have had an interest earnestly in this girl, and they say, well, maybe I can just start the conversation again.  But you have to realize, she's already established a position of authority by not responding.  It's disrespectful.  it is almost treating you like you're not a real human being.  if you then try to ignite it again you are confirming to her or her likely assumption is that you don't have alternative options even though you may.  that's what she's going to arrive at.  And so while she might keep you on the back burner, you know, think of that song, keep me in mind.  Somewhere down the road, you might be lonely.  She's going to see you in that light.  And then, of course, other dudes would say, well, why don't you just call her out on her behavior?  You can be tempted to do that, but it's a mistake because then you just are going to come off as bitter or angry, even if you might be justified.  That is how the situation works, because we are a society that empowers women, but we don't expect them to take responsibility or to treat people with respect, especially men.  Particularly so in the dating interactions, they don't respect men in most cases.  So I bring this up because I did the other video on the abundance mindset and pointed out the flaws in that.  As I noted, I'm a total guy.  I'm okay looking.  I can go out in person and I can find an alternative if I invest time and effort.  I'm not going to BS you and say it's a piece of cake.  or even on online dating.  But for a lot of men, their abundance is an abundance of the same thing.  It's an abundance of the girl who's going to ignore or ghost or just be disrespectful.  They're not going to get anywhere because of how the game is played.  And this is one of the things I talked about some years ago, which I got a lot of hatred and just nasty things said about me by pickup artists and dating roaches, suppository red pillers, and even some larger MGTOWs were joining in the shilling because larger MGTOW channels are about money.  They don't really care, ultimately, about truth.  This is what I've found.  I've observed in a lot of cases.  But at any rate, I made the point that PUA is an extension or a branch of feminism.  They talk about how they're turning the tables, they're changing the game, but that's a joke.  Don't hate the player, hate the game.  But you are essentially just pawns of feminism.  Think about it for a second.  After the 2008 financial collapse, there was this big push for gym maxing, gym selling, whatever.  And when I was younger, there weren't that many dudes who were into roids or big muscles because that was mainly a thing you did if you were like a wrestler, maybe a boxer or a bodybuilder.  It wasn't mainstream.  But then, of course, social media and a lot of this self-improvement meme advanced it.  Well, what happens is if a bunch of dudes start hitting the gym and that becomes sort of a cultural accepted norm and popular, you have simply constructed a new essentially ground for where men have to be.  So it becomes a default that a lot of women expect.  You need to have a six pack or you need to be into gym selling, whatever.  you haven't exactly improved the situation of a lot of these men.  You have not said these standards, which I think women should have high standards, but I'm saying these unrealistic standards, you have not knocked them down.  You've actually made them worse.  That is what the PUA community, whether they like it or not, is doing.  And I'm not against working out or building confidence.  I'm just saying that it's kind of like inflation.  If you print more money, the value of the money declines.  If everyone has a college degree, having a college degree is like a high school diploma, right?  So you eliminate the value by telling more people to do it on a larger scale.  And so this leads us to the question of what is the future going to be?  if we see this type of behavior and it continues to go unchecked, because it probably will, well, I believe I brought up before that the PUAs are going to just change tactics.  They've already tried to do this.  They've tried to change the approach.  One of those things I would argue is going to be a normalization of cuckoldry.  And what they'll say is, well, you know, yeah, you got to watch or get railed by dudes three times a week, but at least you're getting laid.  It's a sign that you're confident in your sexuality.  You're taking all your suppository red pills from her boyfriend.  And so, you know, you know that you're a real man because you're able to watch and you can watch, but you have to know fat.  That's what a real man does.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Um, another thing will be, they'll start telling you to date transsexuals.  I made a video a couple of years ago.  I said that a lot of men are going to become transgender.  Absolutely.  In fact, um, One thing they might do is say guys should consider living as traditional feminine lesbian transvestite transsexuals.  And there's a member of the short, angry, incel trad community.  He would be really good at doing that.  You know, he'd be an expert on that sort of thing.  So they'll do that because it'll be a way of sort of switching stuff around.  You're also going to have more homosexuality, and it'll be put under the guise of, again, are you comfortable as a man?  They'll just say they're bisexual because bisexual is less threatening, but you will see more of that.  The question is, of course, what is the long-term impact?  Enseldom will probably grow.  I mean, I hate to say it, and I'm not like one of those doomer fatalists, but inceldom is probably going to grow because a lot of these dudes are just essentially priced or looks out of the dating market entirely.  And their only option is going to be to be cuckolded or, you know, become a tranny, something like that.  Be gay.  It's going to be a really interesting next 10 or 20 years.  I mean, I made the point earlier about, you know, China and all those incels, are they going to go to war?  Cause these dudes are sexually frustrated.  They want something better out of life.  The same thing is happening in the United States, although we don't have the same population.  And so you wonder, maybe it's going to be India versus China, China versus the United States.  Maybe, you know, maybe Luxembourg is going to annex China.  It'll be called, like, not the Anschluss, the Chinashluss or something.  So there's a lot of different things that we have to keep in mind.  And I just point out the fact... A lot of the behavior we see is not going to be solved by game or by pickup.  People have to stand up and just say, look, these attitudes, this lack of respect shouldn't be acceptable, right?  If you want women to be empowered, you want women to have careers, okay, all for you, right?  But they need to take responsibility for their own behavior.  That's going to be the difficult part, and I don't see it happening, unfortunately, anytime soon. ",
