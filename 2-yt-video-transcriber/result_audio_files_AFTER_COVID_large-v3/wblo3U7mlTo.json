So there is always a warfare around a new beginning.  There is always, read in the book of Revelations, the dragon is there ready to devour the new birth, the male child.  So that's a principle, and the dragon is always there.  So there is a warfare always on your life, on families, cities, churches, ministries, nations, globally, of the dragon, Satan, ready there to devour.  Now, I believe that it is the will of God for President Trump, Donald J. Trump.  By the way, he has a generational inheritance in revival that a lot of people don't know anything about.  He has in the White House the Bible of his great aunts, who were intercessors in the great 1952 Hebrides Islands revival. ",

And they prayed, oh, that you would rent the heavens and come down.  Well, God did.  and duncan campbell and that's a whole nother issue but donald trump literally has as an inheritance the bible of his great aunts who were the two two of the intercessors of the great hebrides island revival.  now having said that i have been shown what could happen.  it is what would be the fullness of god's will i saw.

Trump to be the next Supreme Court justice, Everybody was talking about, a lot of people were, how this was gonna fully tip the scales.  Well, I started praying into it, I mean, into conservatism.  And I started praying into it, and yes, it was an important piece, but the Lord showed me that Donald Trump was appointed, he was assigned to put in place three constitutionally conservative judges.  This was after, and I might not say the name correctly right now, Gorshus, as he was already put in place, which will be a great justice.  Then the battle waged more over the Kavanaugh appointment.  While that happens, I had dreams, visitations, and the Lord came to me and he said that it was his will for Kavanaugh to make it in.  And like many others, You have to pray the promise.  But he showed me that President Donald Trump was assigned to appoint a third judge.  But I saw that a judge, and I know who it is, would hang on to try to stay on the bench in case Trump would not get reelected and then withdraw after his election so as to secure a liberal justice in this person's place.  So the Lord showed me that he has Trump an assignment to appoint a third justice, and he told me she will be an Esther.  This third appointee. ",

            "text": "Yeah, now, I feel it now, too, okay?  I sense, see, we, but we cannot go into this automatic neutral gear.  Que sera, sera, what will be, will be.  That's not the way the kingdom works.  God reveals... and then we pray and we work the promise.  Faith without works is dead.  And so there's a promise that revealed, then we must birth the promise.  So I believe it is the will of the Lord for President Trump to be reelected.  for a long-term reason, if Jesus tarries any at all, and is to turn this nation into for lineage and legacy unto, this was the exact phrase the Holy Spirit gave me, to true constitutional conservatism.  So I believe it's God's will for him to be reelected.  Now I've had another then experience And that happened in January of 2019 when I was touring for my first time President Reagan's museum library.  I think it's in Orange County, California.  And I was walking through there.  I was watching the documentaries.  It's a brilliant, amazing place.  It would be worth anybody's visit.  My first time, I'm walking through, and my Holy Spirit arrests my attention.  And he says, you know, that President Reagan was known as the great communicator.  And I go, yes.  And he said, and you know, at this point in time, President Trump will go down as the great disruptor.  And I go, yeah, I know.  But he spoke something to me about his future.  And I go, okay.  And he spoke something to me about later in the middle of a second term.  He would go in praying that he will become a praying president.  There's a difference.  He will become, Lord willing, in the middle of the second term, there will be such an apprehension of God in his life that he won't only have gone in by praying.  He will be a great man.  praying president, who God will move on his heart, and he will be a part of welcoming in the great awakening. ",
