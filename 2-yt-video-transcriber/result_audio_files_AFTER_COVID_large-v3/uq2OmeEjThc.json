            "text": "Today I want to look at some of the heresies in the early church that we still need to be on guard against.  It's time to unlearn the lies.  Hey, welcome to UNLEARN.  My name is Lex, and I'd like to invite you to join us each week as we UNLEARN the lies and dig deeper into the truth of God's Word.  Let's get started.  Winston Churchill said those who fail to learn from history are condemned to repeat it.  The early church was constantly dealing with heresy and false teachings.  They understood the importance of preserving the truth, and they stood against those who taught contrary to sound biblical doctrine.  We need to be familiar with those false doctrines and heresies of the early church so that we aren't doomed to repeat them.  Jude exhorts us to contend earnestly for the true faith and to beware of false teachers who bring in heresy.  Beloved, while I was very diligent to write to you concerning our common salvation, I found it necessary to write to you exhorting you, to contend earnestly for the faith which was once for all delivered to the saints.  for certain men have crept in unnoticed who long ago were marked out for this condemnation.  ungodly men who turn the grace of our god into lewdness and deny the only lord god and our lord jesus christ.  what lessons can we learn from studying these ancient heresies so that we don't repeat their errors?  Heresy is a belief or opinion that is contrary to sound biblical doctrine.  It could also be defined as false doctrine or false teaching.  Heresy typically manifests in a wrong belief about God.  The Bible warns us about false teachers who bring in destructive heresies.  But there were also false prophets among the people, even as there will be false teachers among you, who will secretly bring in destructive heresies.  even denying the Lord who bought them, and bring on themselves swift destruction.  And many will follow their destructive ways, because of whom the way of truth will be blasphemed.  Peter warns about destructive heresies that deny our Lord and blaspheme the way of truth.  These are the type of heresies I want to look at today.  These destructive heresies that deny important things about our Lord and speak blasphemy against Him.  In the early church, much like today, there were many debates and confusion about the nature of Christ.  Was he God?  Was he man?  Or was he some mixture of the two?  These debates led to certain doctrines that are considered to be heretical.  The first heresy I want to look at is Monarchianism, because it lays the foundation for several other heresies that follow.  Monarchianism is an overemphasis on the oneness of God at the expense of the other members of the Godhead.  Belief in one God is foundational to Christianity, But Monarchianism stressed monotheism to the point of denying God's triune nature.  Monarchians opposed the Trinity doctrine because they feared it would lead to tritheism.  There are two main forms of Monarchianism, which are known as Sabellianism and Adoptionism.  Sabellianism, also known as Modalism, is the belief that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are three different modes or aspects of God.  rather than three distinct persons in one God.  Modalism holds to the deity of Christ, but does not distinguish Him from the Father or Holy Spirit.  This view simply sees the Son as one manifestation of God, and the Holy Spirit as another manifestation of the same God.  They see God revealing Himself in the Old Testament in one mode, then changing modes to reveal Himself as the Son in the New Testament, and changing modes again to reveal Himself as the Holy Spirit later.  Thus, the terms Father, Son, and Spirit are only different names for the same person, not three distinct persons.  Modalism ignores and contradicts the distinction that is made between the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit in the Bible.  For example, we see the Son praying to the Father throughout the gospels, and even making a clear distinction between himself and the Father.  Jesus spoke these words, lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour has come.  Glorify your Son.  that your Son may also glorify you.  And this is eternal life, that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.  And now, O Father, glorify me together with yourself, with the glory which I had with you before the world  was.\".  Notice that before the foundation of the world, the Son had glory with the Father, not as the Father.  So even in His glory, there is a distinction being made between the Father and the Son.  Likewise, we see all three persons of the Godhead present and revealed individually at the baptism of Yeshua.  The Son was baptized, the Father spoke from heaven, and the Holy Spirit descended like a dove.  All three portrayed simultaneously and distinctly from one another.  It came to pass that Jesus also was baptized, and while he prayed, the heaven was opened, and the Holy Spirit descended in bodily form like a dove upon him.  And a voice came from heaven which said, You are my beloved Son, in you I am well pleased.  The Bible also tells us that the Son sits at the right hand of the Father.  One person cannot sit next to himself, which indicates there are two distinct persons being spoken about.  god who at various times and in various ways spoke in time past to the fathers by the prophets has in these last days spoken to us by his son whom he has appointed heir of all things through whom also he made the worlds who being the brightness of his glory in the express image of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins sat down at the right hand of the majesty on high.  We also see that the Son set aside His own will to do the will of the Father, indicating the Son has a separate will from that of the Father.  If the Father and Son are the same identical person, this would not make sense.  Because the Son would not need to set aside His own will to do the will of the Father, if in fact they are the same person, because they would have the same will.  Father, if it is Your will, take this cup away from me.  Nevertheless, not my will, but Yours, be done.  Yeshua even explained there are things that the Father knows that the Son does not know, which indicates that they are separate persons having separate knowledge.  But of that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.  We again see this distinction being made by Yeshua when He spoke about returning to the Father, and He explained that His Father is greater than Himself.  If the Father and Son are the same person, taking different modes or forms, as modalism insists, Then how can the Son claim the Father is greater, or how can the Son return to the Father if they are in fact the same person?  If you love me, you would rejoice because I said I am going to the Father, for my Father is greater than I. The biggest issue with modalism is the denial of the existence of the Father and the Son.  The claim that the Father and Son are different manifestations of the same person is at its core a denial of the existence of the Father and of the Son.  The Bible warns that anyone who rejects the Father or Son is an Antichrist.  He is Antichrist who denies the Father and the Son.  Whoever denies the Son does not have the Father either.  He who acknowledges the Son has the Father also.  Modalism teaches that the Father and Son do not coexist as separate persons in the Godhead.  They insist that God is simply taking different forms at different times.  Therefore, according to the Bible, this doctrine is Antichrist.  God is not changing forms.  but He exists eternally as three distinct persons.  We have seen modalism surface at various times throughout history, but the most notable in recent years is the oneness Pentecostal churches.  Now let's look at the second form of monarchism known as adoptionism.  Adoptionism teaches that Jesus was born fully human and not divine.  They believe He earned His adoption as the Son of God because of His virtue.  Adoptionism denies the eternal pre-existence of Christ and is often, but not always, associated with the denial of the virgin birth.  Adoptionism was one of the earliest heresies identified in the church, being declared a heresy in the second century.  One example of adoptionism is found in the Ebionites who believed that Jesus was adopted as the Son of God because of his sinless devotion to the will of God.  They believed Jesus was the Messiah, but they denied both his divinity and his virgin birth.  We see this similar belief about Jesus in modern Unitarian theology, Mormonism, and various other heretical sects.  Unitarian Christians believe that Jesus was inspired by God in his moral teachings, and that he was a savior, but that he was not a deity or God incarnate, which is basically the same thing Muslims believe about Jesus.  Unitarians believe that Jesus was a great man and a prophet of God, perhaps even a supernatural being, but not God himself.  The denial of the divinity of Yeshua has taken various forms throughout history, but they all share the common belief that Yeshua was created by the Father, that he had a beginning of time, and that the title Son of God was a courtesy that was granted to him.  The denial of the deity and eternal nature of Christ can be seen in several modern non-Trinitarian sects.  These groups believe that Jesus was a created being and not eternally God, although some believe he became divine based on his sinless life.  The most notable examples of this include Christadelphians, Jehovah's Witness and Mormons, among various other lesser known sects.  Like modalism, adoptionism stands in opposition to the Word of God, ignoring, twisting, and even rejecting certain scriptures that contradict their doctrine.  As previously mentioned, many in this category deny the virgin birth that was prophesied by Isaiah and confirmed in the Gospels.  Likewise, by denying His preexistence to creation, they contradict scriptures such as John 1, which describes Yeshua as the Word of God who created all things, or Colossians 1, which says, all things were created by him.  how can all things be created by him if he was a created being?  for by him all things were created that are in heaven and that are on the earth visible and invisible whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers.  all things were created through him and for him and he is before all things and in him all things consist.  We see Christ spoken of as the Creator again in Ephesians, which shows the Son to be present with the Father before creation began, and to make all see what is the fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the ages has been hidden in God, who created all things through Jesus Christ.  these heretics also contradict the words of yeshua when he spoke of the glory he had with the father before the world was.  how could a created being claim to have had glory with god before the foundation of the world?  that is a fundamental impossibility.  and now o father glorify me together with yourself with the glory which I had with you before the world  was.\".  This doctrine also ignores the words of Yeshua when He spoke about how He came down from heaven.  Yeshua even points out that He is unique in this claim, saying, We are from this world, but He is from above.  This is not something a mere human could claim about himself.  You are from beneath, I am from above.  You are of this world, I am not of this world.  He also claimed that He is the only one who has ascended or descended from heaven.  No one has ascended to heaven but He who came down from heaven, that is, the Son of Man who is in heaven.  This is a reference to Proverbs 30 which speaks about God having a Son.  Who has ascended into heaven or descended?  Who has gathered the wind at His fists?  Who has bound the waters in a garment?  Who has established all the ends of the earth?  What is His name and what is His Son's name?  if you know.  Adoptionism is a denial of the deity and eternality of the Son of God.  that requires one to ignore or reject many verses of scripture.  Now let's take a look at one of the most prominent and well-known heresies in the early church known as Arianism.  Arianism is similar to adoptionism in certain ways.  Where Adoptionism says Jesus became the Son of God by adoption, Arianism says Jesus was born the Son of God, but did not exist prior to his creation.  The Arian concept of Christ is based on the belief that the Son of God did not exist eternally, but was begotten in time by God the Father.  Arius stated, If the Father begat the Son, then he who was begotten had a beginning in existence.  And from this it follows that there was a time when the Son was not.  Arians believe the Logos was a divine being begotten by God the Father before the creation of the world, and that God used the Logos as a medium through whom everything else was created.  Although Arianism claims to believe the Son is a deity, they are commonly accused of denying his deity since they claim he was a created being who did not exist eternally as god.  jehovah's witnesses are often referred to as modern-day arians because their beliefs are so similar to arianism in regard to christology.  likewise the church of god's seventh-day salem conference hold similar views to Arianism as well.  The big problem with Arianism is the idea that there was a time when Yeshua was not God.  Because the Bible says there was no God formed before or after God.  The Bible also says that God is the only Savior.  So if Yeshua is not God for eternity, then he is not the Savior.  Before me there was no God formed, nor shall there be after me.  I, even I, am the Lord, and besides me there is no Savior.  This is why Paul calls Yeshua our great God and Savior, because there can be no Savior other than the one true God.  Looking for the blessed hope and glorious appearing of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ.  Arianism basically portrays two gods, a lesser god who is created by the greater god.  This doctrine produces two gods, which is completely contrary to scripture.  that explains there is only one god.  I am the Lord and there is no other.  There is no god besides me.  I will gird you.  Paul explains that God was manifested in the flesh as Yeshua, and he admits that this is a great mystery.  And without controversy, great is the mystery of godliness.  God was manifested in the flesh.  Arianism also has problems with the Bible saying that Yeshua is the fullness of the Godhead.  Because they don't see Him as the fullness of God, but as a created being who is a lesser God.  For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.  Another thing to consider is that if there was a time when the Son did not exist, that means there was a time when God was not the Father.  Because one must have a son to be a father.  This implies a change in the nature of God from being a God without offspring to being a father.  But the Bible says that God does not change.  For I am the Lord, I do not change.  Arianism is considered a heresy because it does not portray a biblical Christology.  It makes Christ into a created being and not the eternal God who always was and never changes.  The scriptures tell us that Yeshua has not changed.  He is the same in the past as He will be in the future, because He is the same forever.  This speaks of His eternal and unchanging nature.  Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever.  The last heresy I want to address is Docetism, which teaches that Jesus did not actually have a physical body, but his body was merely an illusion.  Similarly, they claim that his crucifixion was also an illusion since he lacked a physical human body.  This particular heresy denies the humanity of Yeshua by denying his incarnation.  John says this particular heresy of denying that Yeshua came in the flesh is actually a doctrine of the Antichrist.  Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits, whether they are of God.  Because many false prophets have gone out into the world.  By this you know the Spirit of God.  Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God.  And every spirit that does not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God.  And this is the Spirit of Antichrist, which you have heard was coming, and is now already in the world.  For many deceivers have gone out into the world who do not confess Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh.  This is a deceiver and an antichrist.  Whoever transgresses and does not abide in the doctrine of Christ does not have God.  He who abides in the doctrine of Christ has both the Father and the Son.  This denial of the humanity and death of Christ is completely contrary to the message of the gospel, since the heart of the gospel is the death and resurrection of Yeshua.  Denying His death and resurrection is a denial of the gospel.  This is why John was so adamant that this teaching comes from the antichrist.  Paul explains that anyone who teaches a gospel other than what was revealed in the scripture is accursed.  i marvel that you are turning away so soon from him who called you in the grace of christ to a different gospel which is not another.  but there are some who trouble you and want to pervert the gospel of christ but even if we or an angel from heaven.  preach any other gospel to you than what we have preached to you let him be accursed as we have said before.  so now i say again if any one preaches any other gospel to you than what you have received let him be  accursed.\".  The Bible portrays Yeshua as having the same nature as God, and being equal to God, but taking on flesh so that He could die for our sins.  Christ Jesus, who being in the form of God, did not consider it robbery to be equal with God, but He made Himself of no reputation, taking the form of a bondservant, and coming in the likeness of men, and being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself and became obedient to the point of death, even the death of the cross.  True biblical Christology recognizes the divinity of Yeshua as well as his incarnation, death, and resurrection.  All of the heresies mentioned in this video contradict the clear teachings of scripture about the nature of God in Christ.  The doctrine of Christ is extremely important.  And having a wrong understanding on this topic makes you a heretic who speaks blasphemy through the Spirit of Antichrist.  That's a serious condemnation.  Therefore, we need to be careful not to be led astray by such false teachings about God.  Thanks for watching.
