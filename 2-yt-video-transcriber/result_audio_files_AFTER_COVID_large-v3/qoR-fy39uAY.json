Paul, the bigger question here is, yes, I agree that other forms of gods, especially pantheons, especially in different pagan and neo-pagan groupings, they all have their own area of expertise, let's say, right?  And everybody focuses on that one thing and does that thing.  And, you know, that explains the chaos in the universe for some people.  My concern here is that you're trying to get away from the difficult questions by finding a way through to something that you can prove.  And while on one hand, sure, like we want to find a solution.  Right.  But you're you're.  you're trying to find a solution that still clings to a very specific kind of God.  And this is my problem with things like process theology where they're taking.  I know.  But your goal is to get to theism, right?  eventually yeah.  so here's the deal.  here's the deal goal. ",

And your example about Thor is actually quite compelling to me because you said, how do we know if Thor is all powerful where we look at the mythology and we look at the stories?  Stories and mythology do not prove the existence of a thing.  So before we even look at the attributes, we have to see if it exists in something apart from the stories we're telling about it.
