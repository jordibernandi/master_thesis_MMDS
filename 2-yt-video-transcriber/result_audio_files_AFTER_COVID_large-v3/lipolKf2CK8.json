Now, I am on... record many many times as saying that i really don't think any of these flat earthers actually believe that the earth is flat.  But allow me to change my mind, because the only explanation I can find for CC believing this sort of garbage is that he is genuinely just a stupid person.  And I know that maybe some of you will think that it's a little bit mean of me to call CC stupid, but his wife thinks he's stupid, so why can't I?  He uploads videos to YouTube claiming that the Earth is flat and that the sun is less than 100 miles above Earth.  Stink that! ",

Regarding my community post yesterday, thank you very much to everyone who's replied, but when I was reading through the comments, you made me feel like I said I was dying and I was never going to be able to upload a video again.  Let me clarify what I meant.  Um... Monday is a busy day for me.  I do all the admin at the vape shop and everything we do all the ordering and I'm not getting to start recording my videos until well into Monday afternoon which isn't ideal because I then end up working till 9 10 o'clock Monday night which I don't really want to do because even i need some time off.  so and i know this is a contradiction because it's tuesday and i've released the video but i just happen to get this one done in time.  but my plan going forward is just to change my tuesday video release to a wednesday.  so my videos will now be released on wednesday friday as normal and my live stream will still be on a sunday as normal.  but thank you very much to everybody for the concern.  it really really was touching.  anyway if it is your first time here and you enjoyed the video don't forget to give it a like.  hit the subscribe button turn on bell notifications and all that good stuff.  i'm the creaky blinder.  thank you very very much indeed for watching and i will see you all in the next video which will be on friday.  take care everyone bye.
