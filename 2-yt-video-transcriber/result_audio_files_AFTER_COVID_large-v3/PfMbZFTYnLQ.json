            "text": "So when people talk about Trump derangement syndrome as like a thing liberals have, what they're usually describing is a generation of people raised with the common knowledge that Donald Trump is a bad man who should not be trusted.  And then that generation watched their friends and family happily elect him either as a welcome destructive force or as a guy they liked and agreed with.  It's like, You know that Mitchell and Webb sketch that became a meme where the obvious Nazi bad guy with a skull on his hat is all like, are we the baddies?  Look it up, it's a great bit.  And it keeps coming up for a reason.  Because while sure, Hollywood is left-leaning, but It wasn't always that way.  And since they ultimately just love money, the stories they've told are very basic morality tales.  Nazis are bad, a wolf in sheep's clothing, sleds, good versus evil, man versus wild, detective and genetically enhanced talking dinosaur versus mad scientist, and so on.  And in these morality tales, the villains are very often authoritarian, anger-driven, spiteful, petty, rude, dimwitted, Dishonest, the obviously greedy people in power.  The lowest of hanging fruit for writers to quickly convey that a person or persons is bad, to be defeated.  Which, as I already pointed out too many times by now, was quite often literally just a version of Donald Trump.  Obvious grifter, our living Banksy painting of a president.  It's not complicated unless you make it.  So how do the people defending Trump not get that?  How do they not have a Mitchell and Webb moment where they look at all of the obvious signs and face the fact that they just might be the baddies?  They do it one of two fun ways.  The first is to label these very basic morality tales as propaganda from the left.  Sesame Street, for example, has been around for 50 years and in all that time has taught kids very basic morality, one of which being diversity and civil rights.  The sets are literally based off of Harlem and the show conceived to have a multicultural cast.  And for most of that 50 years, we just accepted that as nonpartisan values.  Barbara Bush would show up to read stories, as did her daughter-in-law, as did her war criminal husband.  But now, this is apparently dangerous propaganda, according to one very smart boy.  And you gotta think what these goons would be tweeting out back when Mr.  Rogers used his show to take a stand against segregated pools.  What a dark world they must live in when Big Bird is seen as the political enemy.  It just, it must be isolating for someone like Ted Cruz, supporter of the sex pest president and hater of masked vigilantes who do property damage and combat the police, to suddenly feel betrayed by The Princess Bride, a movie that was always about a sex pest leader taken down by a masked vigilante.  Like, where does he think he fits in with that story?  It's enough to make a person kind of resentful.  You know, libs owned popular culture, and so they really wanna own the libs.  Trump's good to a lot of them because of spite.  He's payback.  The other and more hilarious method of denial of what art is about is to either pretend to or actually misunderstand what these films are trying to say, and then insist that these films and stories are actually about the things they dislike.
