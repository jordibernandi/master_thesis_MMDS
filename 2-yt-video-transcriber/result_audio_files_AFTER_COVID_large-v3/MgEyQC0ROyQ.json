            "text": "Hello everybody, Peter of England.  Right, as many of you will be aware, on the 29th of May this year, the economic impact payment vouchers from Weirbank were made available.  They were made available initially to people predominantly in the United Kingdom and in the United States.  However, the good news is they will soon be made available to people in Canada, Australia and Germany.  The reason for the initial restriction was the sheer volume of applicants that we were expecting to get, and in fact we did get.  So that's the good news.  The rationale behind these economic impact payment vouchers, which are tied in with what's called the CARES Act in the United States, and the Coronavirus Act 2020, particularly Section 86 for those people in the United Kingdom, are a means of what's called a financial relief for people who have been inconvenienced by the lockdown, by being furloughed from work, and being impacted by all the restrictions that the government have placed upon you via statutory instruments, not law.  So, though the Coronavirus Act in various countries have been possibly passed with a full reading in the various House of Commons and Assemblies, all the additional baggage about you can wear a mask, when you can go out, when you cannot go out, what confinement is, what the R number is, and all that baloney, is nothing more than statutory instruments which are just like corporate bylaws.  Now, the economic impact payment vouchers were offered to the Trump administration and to the administration that was in the United Kingdom, the government bodies, in March of 2019.  So we were prescient on these matters.  We were visionary in this because we foresaw the fact that the way that the debt mountain was climbing, the way that the economies were suffering and were being pumped by the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England and other central banks meant that this pumping as an example in the Federal Reserve case into Wall Street of one billion dollars a day being pumped into the markets to falsely and artificially prop up the stock market figures and to make companies like Tesla, Chrysler, United Airlines or American Airlines look good on paper.  was there really just to put money into the pockets of the fat cats, the magnets of business and the mandarins of industry at the expense of the people.  with the theory that it would trickle down to your pocket.  but in fact it just went into pension funds.  it went into corporate options for CEOs and members of the board and such like.  so you never benefited at all.  so what we are proposing here we were doing it a year ago now is that there should be a quantity.  You're the people that create all the wealth.  You're the people that create the GDP that everybody talks about.  You are the economic machine that needs rewarding.  So, 4-1 has been perpetrated upon the populations due to the lockdown, people not being allowed to conduct their businesses as they should be allowed.  and for all sorts of financial inconvenience.  Now the big question is, as the videos previously have said, who pays for the lockdown?  Who pays for the inconvenience?  Who pays for what you had to forego?  Now what we do find is that there are many banks and financial institutions now that though they gave a three month or four month or longer payment holiday are now coming back even more vigorously and demanding that payments resume, one thing, but that you catch up on the payments that were missed.  So where is this extra money coming from?  The world economy resembles at the moment a large cedar tree in the forest, a redwood in the forests of California.  And it would not be a surprise to me if now that the aristocracy, if the crown, if the House of Windsor that has been disbanded in the United Kingdom and they've all fled as I predicted over nearly two years ago on the channel.  They've all fled and so what we have now is an economy that is actually set to crash.  So what you need to do is to attend a webinar.  There is a webinar scheduled for the 30th of December.  July.  30th of July is a Thursday.  It's at 6pm.  There'll be more information on it down below, so please read the descriptor box.  And this is going to explain the following that many of you have already received, but we hope many more will.  So, this is in effect the package that you get when you've ordered your vouchers.  It comes to you like so.  Within, there are The vouchers themselves.  So depending upon the number that you've required or requested, anywhere between 1 and 5.  There's a restriction of 5 at the moment as a matter.  So these are to pay for debts and problems that you have incurred because of restrictions in your livelihood, your workplace, or basically your way of living generally.  Within there, there are two sets of instructions.  There are a set of instructions to you, showing you what you need to do.  And there are a set then of instructions for the payee, very explicitly showing and telling him, her, it, the corporation, what it needs to do.  So it's very clear, it's very precise.  So the webinar is going to cover... how to handle any pushback that you might be getting from the payee and also to explain the intricacies and the faberg\u00e9 bejeweled item that this economic impact payment voucher really is.  Because it is the first instrument, it is the first financial instrument probably in history that has been issued to you which bypasses the entire financial. ",
