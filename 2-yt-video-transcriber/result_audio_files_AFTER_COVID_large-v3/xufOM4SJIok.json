            "text": "Yo, what it do, YouTube?  Drop Don TV.  I ain't even gonna hold y'all today.  I'm gonna make this video short and sweet.  Short and sweet.  At the end of the day, I don't understand.  And this is what bothers me with black people.  I mean, if you ask around, black people for the longest has been looking for a voice.  Why black people don't have no voice?  I mean, they took Marcus Garvey back in the day from us.  They took Malcolm X back in the day from us.  They took Martin Luther King back in the day from us.  As of now, we have no voice.  We have no leadership.  But time somebody come with a voice and with a little bit of knowledge.  And I'm not saying y'all supposed to agree with everything this dude say.  I'm not trying to say you supposed to disagree with everything this dude say.  But come on, man.  And then this goes out to my Umar Johnson followers that come on this dude videos and want to leak all types of dumb shit.  Like he leading us down the path of destruction.  Umar Johnson leading y'all down the path of what?  Come on, man.  And then it's a lot of y'all.  And this is what I got.  This is what y'all don't understand.  You, you, you.  You sit and promote and tell people we need change.  We need change.  I mean, come on, man.  And I'm not down in Black Lives Matter.  Everything has a purpose.  I'm not a Black Lives Matter follower.  You understand what I'm saying?  And that's just because I feel too much as tainted that Black Lives Matter movement right now to the point.  I don't even think it's more so for us.  They've turned that movement more so for everybody right now.  So I'm not knocking it, but I look at it like this.  Before y'all tear this not fucking around coalition down, how about just listening, man?  And this is the thing, see, and this is what keep black people fucked up.  It's because they want to separate everybody.  And this goes out to my Dr.  Umar Johnson followers.  I mean, how about y'all take a little bit of what that clown say?  Because I'm not going to lie, that clown make valid points on some shit.  Yes, he do.  I don't agree with everything Umar Johnson say at all.  But I mean, just like everybody, man, everybody make good sense of certain shit after a while.  So how about y'all do this?  How about y'all take a little bit of what that dude say, a little bit of what my grandmaster Jay say, and put this shit in a gumbo pack.  And try to work that even down to the Black Lives Matter.  I don't agree with everything they say or what they stand for all the time.  But the thing of it is, my nigga, everybody we got to pull together at some point in time.  Strength is in numbers and long as you keep sitting around tearing people apart for trying to do something.  I mean, how about just listen and give shit benefit of the doubt and take that shit for what it is.  Then you go there, you pick up that little shit from Umar Johnson, take that shit for what it is.  Go to Black Lives Matter, take a little bit of shit from there, and then you put that shit in a pot and come up with your own conclusion.  Ain't nobody forcing this shit on y'all, man.  But at the end of the day, you got to stand for something, because I'm going to tell you something, people.  I'm 44 years old, and if we let this shit slip by this time without change, I mean, what the fuck do you think you're going to leave your kids, yo?  I mean, if y'all selfish asses don't want to do it for you, how about doing it for y'all kids?  if you don't stand for something now.  trust and believe me.  we are in.  if we don't break this now you can trust and believe we are in for another 30 40 years worth of disastrous times.  i mean it's gonna and then you know certain amen it may not be no coming back.  you see how times is changing.  they're trying to throw us back 400 years.  they're trying to set us back 400 years and you see that.  so come on man.  at the end of the day some can be humble Some don't mind protesting and some don't mind.  I mean, it's certain ways people get their anger out.  But don't down this dude because he want to sit around and promote protecting yourself when I feel like that's what most people should do anyway.  But that's all this dude is doing, man.  It ain't like he's sitting around forcing nothing on y'all.  He is trying to tell y'all something that at the end of the day, common sense should have told you a long time ago.  And it's that if it's possible, protect yourself.  Don't wait on nobody to protect it for you.  God gave you a natural born instinct to survive.  And they're taking it away from you.  As you see, they're trying to take everything away from you anyway.  Now they're trying to take your rights away to survive.  So now they're going to be the only ones to fuck people up and get away with it so we can't do nothing.  And that's all this man is trying to say.  In my eyes, I mean, some people see that shit different.  Some people see that he's leading us down a burning path to hell.  I mean, and at the end of the day, guess what?  We already... On our way to a burning path to hell.  So at the end of the day, what is he doing?  It ain't already been done to us.  I mean, and I look at it like this.  It can't get no worse.  Oh, it can get a lot worse.  But come on, black people, what we got to understand, too.  And I know I'm all over the place with it because I don't have a lot of time.  But outside of that, yo, we got to clean up our own community too.  It's too many kids over the 4th of July weekend that had got murdered by gunshots by other black people.  See, that shit is insane.  We running around talking about black lives matter, and that's my whole point.  That's why I don't back a lot of shit.  We understand black lives matter.  Black lives do matter.  But black lives also matter in your neighborhood.  When it comes to your own people, it just don't come from cops and white people killing us, yo.  I mean, we got to start doing a better job of stop killing each other.  And I mean, I know it's a broken record.  Everybody keeps saying the same thing over and over again.  But at the end of the day, we do got to clean up home.  We do got to clean up home.  I mean, home has been fucked up for us for a while, man.  I'm not going to disagree with that.  When I see people sit and comment like, well, yeah, y'all need to get y'all shit together.  You're absolutely right.  We do need to get our shit together.  I mean, I feel like this, man.  When we start losing our children to the bullshit, it's insane.  Fuck these politics.  Fuck all this other crazy shit they got going on out here.  You see these entertainers are still on.  they bullshit.  They still, they acting like this movement don't even exist.  You have one or two that may say it here and there, bring it up.  And that's because they feel they have to.  But come on, man.  One thing we not bringing up is we got to talk about how we going to clean up this neighborhood too.  And I've been seeing bits and pieces of people trying to do it.  I mean, I've been seeing bits and pieces, but as a whole, we got to do better.  I'm not talking about bits and pieces, man, because these kids is getting killed everywhere by us.  It ain't by them.  It's by us.  And the crazy part about it, see, these kids ain't got nothing to do with nothing going on.  So why put them as a victim?  I mean, come on, we're not going to put our kids out there.  It's like a no-win situation for them.  You got to worry about police killing them.  Then you got to worry about your own kind killing them.  Where the fuck do we win at on this situation?  Where do we win?  We got to do better as a whole.  I'm not ashamed to say it.  I done been an idiot out here in this world.  But guess what?  Nigga grew up.  I grew up and I seen better.  You understand what I'm saying?  I just don't want our kids to fall victim by us.  It's bad enough.  they fallin' victims by them.  Don't let us be the other side of they story, too, or they demise.  Man, like I said, I wasn't gonna hold you, man.  It's Drop Diamond.  I'm out, yo. ",
