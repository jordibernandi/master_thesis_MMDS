The next leg, if it doesn't hit right away, some smart people are gonna notice it's coming, and you're gonna start seeing the tsunami.  You know, tsunami is very tricky, because before the tsunami comes, All the fishermen are very happy.  And the reason why, because before the tsunami comes, the water from the coast recedes.  But the amount of pain we will endure to do tshuva depends on us.  The Prophet Isaiah says, Woe to me, for I am doomed, for I am a man of impure lips, and I dwell among people with impure lips.  For my eyes have seen the King Hashem, Master of Legions.  In Hebrew it continues, he says, The prophet Isaiah says, Woe unto me if I have impure lips, and I still expect to speak to HaKadosh Baruch Hu.  if you're gonna speak wasteful conversations about the news, about the stock market, about a bunch of sports that have nothing to do with your vocation, have nothing to do with you making a living.  You're just wasting time, waiting for coronavirus quarantine to be over.  You're just buying yourself more time.  You're smoking a cigarette, wasting your life away.  You're lying, you're cheating, you're cursing.  You're creating Tumaa.  You're creating so much Tumaa that there's a Pasuk in the Tanakh about it.  The Prophet himself says, Woe unto me if I have impure lips.  How can I continue speaking to God?  And he's a Prophet.  Once they stop talking about nothing all day, they actually do Tshuvaa.  then the spirit of Tumaa leaves and immediately their prayer is lifted to heaven and is able to be answered. ",

            "text": "The lies penetrate everywhere spreading it to the whole world, embarrassing families, destroying people, and sometimes even innocent people.  Everybody forgets that the Torah say even the truth you're not allowed to publish about a Jew.  The truth.  But it became a habit.  It's everywhere and nobody almost say anything.  The world becoming a zoo.  The biggest enemy of humanity became the internet.  Millions of people were dragged into a world of crime and horrible things as a result of going into the internet.  The things that they saw over there.  How many Hasidic boy calling me every week and sending me messages describing what destroyed their life.  How great they used to be.  until the minute, one minute, they saw something in the internet and that was the end of them.  Because nobody saw it coming, nobody prepared the education system ahead of time to the new war out there.  You have kids that learn Gemara, they know everything, every comment about it, and they don't believe in Hashem.  Teaching him to be a robot, saying Gemarot by heart, wow, what a Talmid Chachan, he doesn't believe if there is Hashem.  You see all the liberal Jews that some of them went to schools in a very high level of yeshivot.  And when a rabbi speak today and say the word, we got punished, they get angry.  We say mida keneked mida, they want to kill you.  They murder you online for saying something that every foolish kid one generation ago knew it without any doubt.  That everything that happens to us, we brought it on ourselves.  You're not allowed to say it today.  meaning what we're having today started the moment Adam HaRishon broke the words of Hashem.  are constantly growing like cancer.  It starts in one cell and goes to thousands.  People are becoming more materialistic in their ideology.  It's growing.  The war is changing.  Materialism taking over spirituality.  Medei dor vedor mitpateh hamada.  Science is developing from generation to generation.  Mitrabot afshariyot lintzol olam hazeh letohele ta'adaf.  People learn to take more and more advantage at what this materialistic world has to offer.  Ketotzaa mikaf mitraba gehavat ta'adaf.  As a result of that, the pride of the human being is constantly growing.  Why?  What's the connection?  is feeling I'm in control of the world with my mind and the toys that I invented, with my computer.  A person feels more and more confident about himself and more independent.  \u05d5\u05dc\u05d0 \u05d9\u05d1\u05e6\u05e8 \u05de\u05de\u05e0\u05d5 \u05db\u05dc \u05d3\u05d1\u05e8.

So, watching your eyes, watching your surroundings, watching your mouth, and last but not least, choosing your friends.  The valuable lesson is that if a person truly knows how to use this tool that Hashem gave him, that Hashem gave her, you could literally elevate your neshama to different worlds.  Needless to say, elevate the world to a different place.  HaKadosh Baruch Hu gave us a gift. ",
