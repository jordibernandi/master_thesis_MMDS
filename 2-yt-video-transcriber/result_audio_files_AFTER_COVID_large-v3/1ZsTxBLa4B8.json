            "text": "It's not appropriate to laugh at the misery of your opponents.  Apparently, it's not very sportsmanlike.  That's what people have been saying.  It's not a good thing.  It's not becoming of the left.  Hey, do you remember when Donald Trump got COVID, how there were some people who actually thought that was funny?  There were some people who actually laughed at that.  And that was me.  I was one of them.  I thought it was fucking hilarious.  I hope he gets it again.  Right-wing watch has been amazing lately just for the amount of meltdowns.  Joe Biden, last night, you have brought a curse upon yourself and your family, your children, and your children have shown down to the third and fourth generation, and you need to repent.  I don't care if you are pro-life.  You cannot call yourself a Christian.  and call yourself a republican or vote for biden you know what i mean or call yourself a democrat.  i mean whatever it is.  you call yourself a democrat and a christian.  it doesn't matter if you voted for the dark side.  that's what you did.  you are implementing the dark agenda satan's agenda the kingdom of darkness.  you are not supporting the kingdom of god and if you cannot see that If you do not repent, judgment will fall upon you, I believe, and your family and your children's children down to the third and fourth generation.  Let me tell you something.  Every Christian... Man, it never stops.  That's a lot of generations.  The blood oath.  Expose it all.  Expose it all, Lord.  And Lord, if it be your will and if it be necessary, another election, another voting day, whatever it takes under your kingdom, oh God, to bring it all in line.  Bring it all in line.  Bring it all in line with the will of God.  I mean, you had an election, you're just not accepting the results.  Smash the clay jar of deceit.  This is Michelle Bachman, by the way, everyone.  Do you remember Michelle Bachman?  You know, this is not just like some unknown preacher from another age.  Yeah.  I ask, oh God, that you would take your iron rod and I ask that you would smash... The clay jar of deceit in America.  Smash the clay jar of delusion in the United States of America.  Smash the delusion, father, of Joe Biden as our president.  He is not.  Would you take your iron rod and smash the strong delusion that Nancy Pelosi does have her House of Representatives?  I feel like she's kind of getting... Getting the horny stick out.  Doesn't that kind of feel like the horny stick?  No.  No.  Too much time in lockdown.  Being horny.  Stop it.  Stop it.  Hasan was not making a post about his chest.  It's not appropriate to respond that way.  Do not make a joke about the OnlyFans account.  When is it coming?  It's never coming.  So stop.  Smash it in Jesus' name.  Smash, Lord, the takeover of the U.S.  Senate by Chuck Schumer.  Lord, smash it with your iron rod.  I ask, oh God.  Someone's asking what happens if Trump actually pulls this off.  It's game over at this point.  At this point, it won't probably even be seen by a higher court.  No one's going to entertain this.  It's not as if it's a close call.  I mean, he can start all these lawsuits.  He can do everything.  But it's not like it's going to reach the Supreme Court.  It's not like it's going to get to a point where all three... Even the people that Donald Trump has stacked, if it's a 290 electoral college victory, it's... It's done.  I mean, this this at this point is just.  it's just really the last gasp.  It's it's.  it's unfortunate because everyone wants a moment like we all want our bunker moment.  We want something big and grandiose to happen.  We want Donald Trump to actually be carried out of the White House screaming and crying like a penchant child.  Like, that's what you want to see.  Unfortunately, it's going to be slow and boring.  Oh, Laura Loomer.  Parlaying.  If you boycott Fox News, they won't have enough viewers, which means they won't have any advertisers.  Wow, cancel culture.  Which means they won't be able to pay their hosts, which means they'll eventually fail financially.  We can't allow for the legacy of Roger Ailes to be turned into another left-wing propaganda outlet.  For the communists who are allowing for our elections to be stolen.  Fox News proved to us that they can't be trusted as fair and balanced.  When they called Arizona for Biden.  And when they called the presidency for Joe Biden today.  They seem to have no problem with the Democrats openly stealing an election in plain sight.  Boycott.  Fox News.  Damn.  Cancel culture.  Laura Loomer.  I'm glad she finally got to poop after, you know, handcuffing herself to the elections office.  Because that was going to end poorly.  Oh, yeah, didn't Rudy Giuliani give a press conference with a known child rapist or something to that effect?  I could be wrong on this.  It's hard.  I get them all mixed up.  Because they don't decide the election.  The call for Joe Biden isn't... What was it called by?  All the... Oh, my goodness.  All the networks.  Wow.  All the networks.  We have to forget about the law.  Judges don't count.  All the networks, all the networks, all the networks thought Biden was going to win by 10%.  Gee, what happened?  There you have it.  It's really weird that that's kind of the spin that's happening right now, that all of them are referring to the fact that, well, the networks don't get to call the election.  I was like, that's correct.  You're entirely correct.  The networks actually didn't call it on Wednesday or Thursday when most people on the left were like, well, yeah, this is mathematically over.  can't possibly win.  he would have to win every single state and even then the margins are becoming razor-thin and and We haven't even gotten to the mail-in ballots yet when they come in they're overwhelmingly for Joe Biden.  cuz Donald Trump said not to use them.  So of course his base isn't really using them.  It's just the people who wanted to vote for Trump, but also defy him.  so So just there's no.  But see this is all getting really dangerous.  Oh god, not Bill Mitchell.  Bill Mitchell It is literally a miracle of God that he became president, and also it's going to be a miracle when he becomes president again, and we win the house back.  As I said in 2016, God plus us is enough, and that's true.  God plus us is enough.  Let not your heart grow weary, okay?  Don't be afraid.  Don't listen to the lies of the deep state.  Don't listen to the lies of the media.  Hang in there.  Stay strong.  Commit to bringing five to ten of your friends to the polls.  early either early voting voting or november 3rd.  let's show these guys what turnout really means.  i predict there is going to be okay.  i know i've got a lot going on.  if you're not like familiar with twitch all this must seem like you know.  the chat up there probably seems like a lot and then you know having that there's a lot.  but wow You are pushing it to the limits.  There's very little real estate for you to speak.  It's basically this last little square here.  So much information and the news going down here.  Oh, and you selling your Hawken products.  And at the bottom, more text going.  Like, this is just an overload of information.  The greatest Republican turnout in the history of this Republic this November 3rd and the time leading up that I think it is going to absolutely swamp Democrat turnout because Democrats are not motivated right now.  Democrat enthusiasm is running about below Republican.  It has never been that much of a difference ever.  Folks, we're going to win this election.  We're going to win the White House.  We're going to win back the House.  We're going to have a MAGA Congress.  We're going to have a MAGA Senate.  It's going to happen, folks.  It's going to happen, folks.  You thought those Democrats are crying on 2016.  It's going to be a lot worse.  Yeah, it's just like it's not working out for you.  The math isn't.  right-wing pastor guarantees.  Donald Trump is going to win by a landslide.  This nonsense is worse than a witch hunt.  It's a constitutional massacre.  We are sick and tired of leftist propaganda.  You can't just make up stuff because you don't like somebody.  We are going to win.  That is 100% fact.  America has spoken.  We're sick of your foolishness.  Donald Trump is going to win in 2021. by an absolute landslide.  oops i think someone forgot to get that memo.  so since magacopium is down does that mean that all the variety?  well there's still some of the good ones here right?  ah don't you feel better?  i'm running against the single worst candidate in the history of presidential politics and you know what that does.  that puts more pressure on me.  can you imagine if you?  I'm being honest.  This is still making me rethink my position on the drug war.  Maybe we need harsher rules for drugs.  This shit's out of control.  I can't think of another way to stop it.  Do you really want to legalize copium?  Do you see what would happen?  I want to see the funniest MAGA reaction.  Oh, here we go.  All right, everyone.  I know, I know.  Let's just, let's just get this one out of the gates.  Okay.  I know it's like, it's not appropriate to laugh at that.  The misery of your opponents.  Apparently it's not, it's not very sportsmanlike.  That's, that's what people have been saying.  It's not, it's not a good thing.  It's not, it's not becoming of the left.  Hey, do you remember when Donald Trump got COVID?  How there were some people who actually thought that was funny.  There was, there was some people who actually laughed at that.  And that was me.  I was one of them.  I thought it was fucking hilarious.  I hope he gets it again.  I hope he gets it now because he's already lost.  And I think it'd be even funnier if he got it a second time because after all, he's responsible for so many people, you know, dying from that disease.  And it's kind of ironic that he of all people would catch it at the same time.  Anyways, anyways, taking it back.  I think before things get out of control.  And they're going to get out of control.  Trust me.  OK, things very shortly are going to probably become pretty shitty.  They're going to become less shitty.  They're definitely going to be less shitty than the fascist.  But we're about to see the whole Biden cabinet come in and we're going to be like, you know, this wasn't the hope or change we believed in.  This is more returning to the soul of the nation.  And she's a cop after all.  So I just want to spend a little bit of time enjoying the sweet, the sweet, chatty MAGA tears.  All right.  I think I think we can.  we can drink some of those tears.  We don't have to put them in a cup the way Republicans do.  We don't have to actually try and get off or sustain ourselves with them.  We can just enjoy some some schadenfreude.  All right.  Some some good old schadenfreude.  That's that's all we got to do.  Let's get some schadenfreude.  It looks good.  My facial hair looks disgusting.  I feel like Ron Jeremy must feel like right now.  Because Ron Jeremy is about to go to jail for like 47 counts or something.  He's a bad man, that Ron Jeremy.  Sorry, Schadenfreude.  Schadenfreude.  You keep teaching me how to say it, I keep on saying it the wrong way.  Schadenfreude.  Enjoy the Schadenfreude, alright?  Let's all drink it from the cup of the Schadenfreude.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Let's enjoy it, alright?  Yes.  putting him over the 270 electoral votes he needs to become the 46th president of the United States.  The Biden-tried family steals the election.  The media's covering it up.  The Biden-tried family steals this election.  The media's covering it up.  The Biden-tried family steals this election.  The media's covering it up.  We want our freedom for the world.  Give us our freedom, Joe Biden.  Joe Biden's covering up this election.  He's stealing it.  Where were we?  What was the last question?  The media said what?  The media said Joe Biden's president.  Ha!  I can't.  You're happy with your corner coffee shop.  They want to make you drink Starbucks every day from now until forever.  No matter how it tastes.  That's the future they promise.  Okay, like, I get Starbucks is a shitty company.  Alright, it is.  It's very exploitative.  It doesn't pay the workers a good wage.  It doesn't let them unionize.  Fuck Starbucks.  That doesn't sound terrible.  Starbucks coffee is kind of yummy.  It's just really overpriced.  But it's not a bad product.  I mean, I don't understand the logic here.  Like, imagine a future where you have to drink very expensive coffee.  that's quite delicious.  But that's basically it.  That's the hell.  The hellscape that they want you to live in.  The fact is that... A lot of you guys who went balls to the wall hard as fuck with Trump.  I'm into this election.  I'm literally on my timeline saying, you might have a shot, but you know what the fuck it is.  You know what the fuck it is.  Do not let these sons of bitches fucking tell you different.  You know what it is.  Look inside yourself.  It was real.  It is real.  And if you are not willing to fight, then damn it, you are willing to lay down and let these crooks run America.  I can't live like that.  You know what?  It's on.  It's on.  This is what they wanted for.  This is what they pushed for.  And all these four years, they just pushed and pushed and poked.  Nothing's going to happen, right?  We're going to lay down and kick it like dogs, like they've been kicking us.  Let one motherfucker come in my face.  Stop them now!  Stop them now!  Very mixed messages, Sam.  I don't I don't like us.  Stop the count.  Sure.  But if you do that, Biden wins.  Oh, no, no, no.  Keep the count.  Keep the count.  OK.  All right.  Yeah, this Nazi.  This Nazi started giving a speech yesterday and was so excited, so animated, just going off the whole time.  And then all of a sudden, yeah, I know, I know.  I was like, y'all are going to light me up in two seconds.  We're like, how many dog whistles is he going to throw out there?  It was like dog whistle after dog whistle after dog whistle until the very end.  Oh, that's Catboy Cammy.  I thought I recognized that motherfucker.  That's the Catboy.  I thought I recognized him.  Wow.  All right.  Well, that makes sense.  That makes sense.  This is Nick Fuente's boyfriend.  Wow.  Yeah.  And yeah, in the middle of it, all of a sudden he was like, we will not allow the Jews to replace us.  And I was like, oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Have you been made aware that it's Nick Fuentes?  Oh, no, I've seen the videos.  At first I was like, because I'm going to be honest, I hate the kind of the homophobic thing that whenever a guy is around another guy, they must be like fucking each other.  Or if a guy is doing something with someone else, it's like, oh, yeah, Trump's got to be sucking Putin's dick and all that kind of stuff.  Right.  I think that that title stereotype is kind of gone.  But when I did watch the Nick Fuentes cat boy videos, I go, yeah, no, they're definitely, they're definitely sucking each other's dicks.  There's no question that those two, those two are definitely gay lovers.  This is like, yeah, there was, there was not a single doubt in my heart.  I was like, oh yeah, this is actually, this would be a beautiful story if they weren't both like, you know, blackface wearing Nazis.  Cause then it's just kind of, just kind of horrifying.  But yeah, yeah.  It's wait, creationist cat and Vadim proved that it's Nick's son.  It's the next sun.  Wait, what?  Okay, now y'all are just memeing too close to the sun.  Alright, things are hyper-inflating into themselves.  Alright, let's finish this Tears compilation.  for the lives of the Jews this time!  This time!  We know our war is with them!  USA!  USA!  USA!  I'm not asking for little sweetheart letters.  I'm asking why aren't they demanding the Department of Justice step into a political crime as it appears obviously demanding.  Good compilation.  I wish the music wasn't there though.  It was just like, you kind of got monotonous.  Hey, we want to mutual aid you to get some eyeballs on your work.
