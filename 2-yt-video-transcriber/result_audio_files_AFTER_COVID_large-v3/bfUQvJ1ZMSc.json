So you put all of that behind you, and you don't bring any of that up.  No one's kind of confronting each other or arguing and saying, I'm right about this.

So that is basically the encompassing message of what I talk about.  That's the book that I wrote.  And I got to describe it of how I got there.  Not necessarily what's in the book, but why I wrote the book.  And a lot of guys can relate.  You've either been divorced, you had bad breakups, you're dealing with children, and a lot of guys can relate to that.  So I got to introduce them to that.  And then the next talk was directly to fathers, so that was the patriarch.  And the idea was that there's a system that is designed to remove the masculine man from the home, all right?  What are the consequences of that?  So you're talking to a dynamic group of men, divorced fathers, men who want to have kids.  And there were people in the audience that I was trying to relate that message to.  and that could understand it on that level.  So amazing opportunity to be able to talk to these people about it.

So the roles are actually switching a little bit, and we're gonna talk about the confusion and chaos that's created.  from that and why we are now most.  there's more single women than ever.  there's less married people.  there's the birth rates declining.  so I'm gonna try to put a context on that and talk about how we're basically causing confusion.  but the reason why we're doing it is for our own selfish needs of resources here.  so I'm gonna put that message into play.  I'm also going to talk about the book that I wrote about feminism And we're going to talk about why we got here.  It's interesting to me to tell you the truth.  There's a group of women here that are looking for a message and they're coming to these particular groups of men forward.  I think that's phenomenal for them to take that step.  and they're willing to be open-minded and listen and take something from it.

They need a rock.  Most women are looking for rocks.  They're looking for strong men.  After a while, you keep presenting that presence, that feminine presence to her, she's gonna lose respect for you.  And this is the dilemma overall that women have.  Unfortunately though, it's kind of like playing both sides of the coin, they're getting the benefits of men's femininity, right?  Okay, you don't want to be competitive in the workplace.  We'll take those jobs and they'll stepping up for those resources.  So we're at a really critical crossroads in and gender dynamics.

There's a lot of celebration of feminism and of course women are in the workplace now, they're competing, they're making more money.  They now make up the vast majority of the employed workers in the United States by 51%.  But the reality is there's been a scoreboard of feminism that they're not revealing.  There's been a lot of things that have come Basically not good results from it, but you're not going to hear it unless people dig out that information.  And I spend a great amount of that book digging out that information and presenting it.  A lot of people don't like to accept the information.  And that's a critical word.  They don't want to accept that.  that's a byproduct of feminism.  But I believe in cause and effect.  I believe in an equal and opposite reaction to everything.  So whatever positives you got, you're certainly going to get negatives.  People just have to accept those negatives.  If you don't want to accept the negatives and place blame on other things, well then you're not accepting the full weight of feminism.  So that's what the book's about. ",

Not only that, you look at the family structure.  As a result of both people leaving the homes, kids suffered a little bit.  The grades are down.  Performances are down.  Kids are more obese.  They're less productive.  How do we deal with that?  Who's going to deal with it?  Obviously, the school's not dealing with it well.

It's not sitting at home, you know, I want to get out and move.  Fortunately, I've been able to make some good connections with people like you, Anthony.  That wasn't available to me early in 2020.  Now we have that.  Hopefully we can build on that.  Maybe I might write a third book.  Who knows?  All right.  But I want to continue building the audience that I am.  The numbers are going up daily.  So I say.  They're here for a reason.  I'll keep giving them content. ",
