            "text": "Big announcement.  Are you ready for it?  Big, big, big, big, big announcement.  So, I have been asked 1,000 times over the past few years, why in the world are you in California?  Like, why?  Why would Daily Wire stay in California?  I mean, this place has turned into a hellhole.  all day long on the show is just complain about how bad California has been.  And the answer was that I've been in California literally my entire life, except for a three-year stint when I was at Harvard Law School in Boston.  Aside from that, I've spent my entire life in California.  And I love this state.  It's a beautiful state.  It's a state with a lot of culture and a lot of fun to it.  It's a great place in terms of activities.  You got the beach nearby.  You got Disneyland.  And then over time, it just became a hellhole.  And it has become a hellhole at this point.  And so yesterday, we here at The Daily Wire announced that we are moving the entire company to Nashville.  So just yesterday, Governor Jerry Brown, former governor of California from 1975 to 1983, and then again from 2011 to 2019, He said, where are you going to go?  Where are you going to go?  You can't, you know, OK, you say that California is bad.  Where are you going to go?  The answer is we are going to Nashville.  We are taking the entire company and we are picking up and we are leaving and we are putting our headquarters in Nashville.  That is where the company will now be located.  We're taking all 75 of our jobs and we're taking our tens of millions of dollars in annual revenue.  And we are moving all of that outside the state of California.  And this is specifically and really only due to the crappy governance of the state.  It is not because we are foreign to the state.  Again, I've lived here my entire life.  My business partner, Jeremy Boring, has been here for 20 years.  My parents have been here longer than I've been alive.  We're not doing it because we dislike California, because we are newbies, because we couldn't take the heat, anything like that.  I've been here the whole time.  We are leaving because this place has become so horribly governed that if you have the means to get out, and if you have a company relying on you, and if you have employees who are relying on you, you are going to leave.  We are but the tip of the spear.  We are not the only ones.  Elon Musk has already decided to leave the state.  He'll probably be taking a lot of employees with him over time.  Joe Rogan has already left the state.  We are leaving the state as well.  Again, we are taking 75 employees who are based in California and we are moving.  We have about 100 employees across the country.  And we are relocating to a state that is not run like garbage, Tennessee.  And now, did my business partner and I, did Jeremy and I and Caleb Robinson, our other business partners, did we ever think that we were going to be moving this company to Nashville?  No.  Otherwise, we wouldn't have built up these big, beautiful studios here in Los Angeles and employed a bunch of people in Los Angeles.  And hilariously enough, when we announced this to our employees, we thought, OK, a lot of people are going to be very upset about it.  It turns out far more of our employees are excited about leaving California than would be excited about staying in California because this place has become unlivable.  Not only is the rent too damn high because of all of the garbage zoning regulations here, but the quality of life here has degraded radically.  Now, I'll be honest with you.  I had a tough time convincing my wife just to leave California.  Okay?  And to be frank with you, I'm going to be splitting my time in some different places, not just in Nashville.  But the fact is that trying to get my wife... To leave California was not an easy task because she too has spent a lot of her life in California.  She lived in Sacramento and now she lives in LA.  And so she's been in California for a very long time.  And over the past two years, she's looked around and she said, okay, I guess you're right.  And the reason for that is perfectly obvious.  Between the city of Los Angeles deciding that they were going to cede the entire city to low-level criminality, they were not going to enforce the law, they were not going to keep the streets clean, they were not gonna make it livable for me to allow my children to play outside of our front gate without adult supervision, Between them allowing the streets to become incredibly dirty and dangerous.  because here's the reality.  If I let my kids walk around the neighborhood, they will stumble across two open needles during the course of that walk because the city has specifically told law enforcement they can't do anything about the rampant homelessness problem that has plagued Los Angeles.  There are 66,000 homeless people in L.A.  County.  Every single underpass in L.A.  has entire living facilities for homeless people.  This is not, by the way, sympathy to the homeless, many of whom really need serious help.  They are drug addicted or mentally ill.  And the city has decided that in the name of freedom, they are going to allow the suburbs to be overrun by this homelessness problem that does affect people who are paying their taxes.  And between that, between the fact that they've decided to defund the cops and move away from allowing the police to do their jobs entirely, between the increase to taxes and the higher levels of crime and the lower levels of cleanliness, between the fact that God decided to plague the state with a giant wildfire spate over the last several years, apparently.  It's like, I didn't need the help, God.  Like, I got it.  I got it.  I didn't need the signs and the wonders to drive me from California.  And frankly, I'm just hoping that when Michael Moles looks back at California as we make our way out, that he turns around, he looks back, and he immediately turns into a pillar of salt.  Like, that is my dream.  But Whether or not that happens, we are leaving and you're gonna see more of this.  Again, you're gonna see a lot of this.  New York, New Jersey, Connecticut.  You're gonna see this in LA.  You're gonna see this in San Francisco.  People are going to pick up and they're going to leave.  And the people who are most likely to leave are the people who can afford to leave.  Let's be honest about this.  The people who are going to get trapped in Los Angeles are the people who are lower middle class because they don't have the wherewithal to pick up and leave.  They don't get to decide honestly where their jobs take place.  As the head of a company, I get to decide where we take our jobs.  And we are excited to allow our people a better living standard.  moving to someplace like Nashville that is not governed like garbage in a red state, then forcing them to stay in a place that is very difficult to raise children and to live.  But blue states for too long have thought that they can govern as badly as they want and there will be no consequences.  That's true to a point.  And then beyond that point, it is no longer true.  We have reached the breaking point.  We are leaving.  And so Daily Wire will see you in Nashville. ",
