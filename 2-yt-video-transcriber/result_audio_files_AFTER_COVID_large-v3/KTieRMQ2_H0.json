            "text": "Well, I'm not that old.  All aboard, and welcome to Matt Baume's Culture Cruise.  Last month I showed you a 1983 episode of Cheers, where everybody panicked because they were afraid the bar was turning gay.  Well, this month I want to show you what happened next.  Basically, a decade of the gang more or less refusing to believe that gays exist, until a queer icon showed up to more or less set them straight.  Well, not straight, but you know.  By the way, thanks to everyone who makes Culture Cruise possible with a pledge of support on Patreon, folks like Campbell, Lyman Cameron, and of course, Joanne.  Backers get early, ad-free access to videos, stickers and books in the mail, and more.  If you're enjoying these videos, head over to patreon.com slash matt baume to join the folks who make them possible.  Cheers' first episode to focus mainly on LGBTQ issues was 1983's The Boys in the Bar.  I talked about that one in detail in my last video, there's a link in the description.  But it actually wasn't the first time that queer issues came up on the show.  There was a super brief gay storyline on the show's second episode.  In that one, a distraught dad comes into the bar.  He's upset that his son is gay.  And initially, Coach suggests that the dad just throw his kid out of the house, which is not great.  The fact that one of the main sympathetic characters on a show could just casually suggest disowning your gay kid really tells you everything that you need to know about mainstream attitudes of the time.  But there is a twist.  The dad realizes that he can't throw his son out of the house because he loves him too much. ",

But I gotta point out that the gay character exists completely off-screen.  We never actually see them.  So plus one point for tolerance, minus one point for visibility.  So now let's jump ahead a few episodes to The Boys in the Bar.  Despite the entire episode being about queer people, the gay characters aren't even acknowledged until the last moments of the episode, and even then they only get one single word of dialogue.  What's more, for at least part of the episode, the gang refuses to believe that there are any gay people in the bar at all. ",

            "text": "Too ugly to be gay.  Obviously gay people are everywhere, even in bars.  Sometimes especially in bars.  But around this time, late 70s into the 80s, there were a lot of episodes of TV where gay characters weren't really allowed to be gay characters.  They're either completely off-screen, or their very existence is denied, or they turn out not to have been gay at all.  For example, the entire premise of Three's Company is that the gay guy isn't actually gay.  On Kate and Ally, the straight characters lie about being lesbians.  On the pilot episode of The Facts of Life, Jo thinks she might be a lesbian, but Mrs.  Garrett convinces her that she isn't.  There's a rumor about Les on WKRP in Cincinnati that he's gay, but he's not.  Murder, She Wrote had a drag queen who turned out to be straight.  The Love Boat, Sanford and Son, and Hotel all had episodes about LGBTQ issues without showing any LGBTQ people.  To be fair, there were also some genuinely strong queer characters around this time, like Beverly on All in the Family, Edie Stokes on The Jeffersons, and a surprisingly dignified gay guy on an episode of Night Court.  But from the late 70s into the 80s, there was this weird ongoing trope on TV of queer people being hinted at, but then not actually existing.  Either they were kept totally off-camera, or they turned out to be straight, or they were gay but everyone refused to believe them.  And that trope popped up repeatedly on Cheers.  On a 1984 episode entitled, perhaps appropriately, Fairy Tales Can Come True, the game wonders if Cliff might be gay because they've never seen him with a woman.  Coach breaks in with a speech that's almost very affirming. ",

We need to talk for a minute about just who Harvey Fierstein is, and why he's such a big deal, and why it's so amazing to see him on a sitcom.  Harvey started out in New York theater in the 1970s, acting in a show by Andy Warhol and a few others, until he wrote his first play, a big hit called Torch Song Trilogy.  It's really three shows in one, a look at the lives and loves of gay people.  It wasn't the world's first gay play, but it was the first that broke through to mainstream audiences, jumping from Off-Off-Broadway to Off-Broadway, and then finally Broadway, with a cast that included a very young Matthew Broderick and a slightly less young Estelle Getty, Golden Girl Sophia.  The real innovation with Torch Song Trilogy is that a ton of people saw it at a time when a lot of people had no idea what the lives of LGBTQ people were like, which was kind of exhausting.  Watch Harvey's response to this question from Barbara Walters in 1983. ",

The trope of shows refusing to let gay people exist \u2014 pushing them off screen, trying to straighten them out, giving gay storylines to straight characters \u2014 was getting pretty tired by this point, and around this time it just started to fade away.  Seinfeld featured a storyline three years later where Elaine tries to convert a gay But her efforts to convert him are such a huge failure that the episode essentially says it's impossible.  Gay people exist, and straights are just going to have to get used to it.  There's still the occasional episodes where someone pretends to be gay, most notably on Frasier, a spinoff of Cheers.  But now there's a difference.  Those episodes don't just have fake gays.  They now also have real gays who get lines.  They get to talk about their love lives.  They get to exist on screen and out loud, no denial or conversion in sight.  And although it took a while for TV to catch up, this is essentially what the song I Am What I Am was blasting at Broadway audiences in the 1980s.  That song is about proclaiming yourself when people want to erase you, refusing to be silenced.  Listen to these lyrics.  It's obvious why the song has endured.  I am what I am, and what I am means no excuses. ",
