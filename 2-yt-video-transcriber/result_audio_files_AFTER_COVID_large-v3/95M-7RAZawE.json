This is one thing that I've always, and I'm glad we finally, look, we can bridge this racial divide.  It's like the black and white cookie, Seinfeld.  When you think about that, right, they're actually, they start locking Asians out because you guys do very, very well academically.  What do you think that does to the relationship between Asian Americans and black Americans?  That's always a concern of mine.  I mean, the same thing with white Americans, but particularly, listen, I grew up in Canada, and I'm not gonna lie, a lot of Asians behind closed doors, a little bit racist in Canada.

So like, cause like, and I know the African American, especially in the inner cities, like academic, academic excellence achievement is very shunned upon, especially with like the gangs and stuff like that.  I think that creates a big divide, especially on the income.  For example, the top four ethnic groups in America, the top earners are all Asians, Indians, Japanese, Thai.
