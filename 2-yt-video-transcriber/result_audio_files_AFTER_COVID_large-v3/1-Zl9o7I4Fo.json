Rather, this one creates a gravitational field that this one sees.  But the gravitational field of this one spreads in space.  And because of the way the surface area grows as the distance grows, as it spreads in space, it falls off at such a rate as to produce an inverse square.  So it's just a geometrical fact about three space dimensions that you get an inverse square law.  So an example of why physicists consider Newton's, sorry, Einstein's theory better than Newton's, is that Newton could have changed the inverse square law and Einstein couldn't.  So Einstein, if you like, explained the inverse square law.  Newton just postulated it. ",

A very early example was calculus, which is completely fundamental mathematically, but was invented because Newton needed it to describe the planetary orbits.  A more contemporary example, which involves the work of Karen Ollenbeck, Simon Donaldson, and other mathematicians, is that to understand four manifold theory, which means, in layperson's terms, to understand the properties of four dimensional spaces, mathematicians needed these equations called the instanton equations, which emerged from physics.  So mathematicians studying geometry learned that four-dimensional spaces are particularly interesting.  And there were two surprises here.  One is that the four dimensions of the real world where you've got to remember Einstein taught us to include time, so we've got four dimensions.  The four dimensions of the real world turn out to be the most interesting case, even if you're just interested in math.  But also to understand this most interesting case required equations that came from physics, the instanton equations. ",

But most of us probably aren't aware that in the 20th century, mathematicians developed a rather deep mathematical theory of knots, which roughly speaking, is a theory that describes all the way that that piece of string could have been tangled.  And it has got many connections with physics.  So even very early developments, like the Alexander polynomial of a knot, discovered, I think, around 1920 by one of my predecessors here at the Institute, James Alexander.  He had no particular interest in physics, but later was understood that the Alexander polynomial can be naturally formulated in terms of quantum physics.  Now, half a century or so after Alexander, von Jones discovered something called the Jones polynomial, a much richer generalization, which gave, if you like, more truths about how the piece of string can be tangled.  And I have the good fortune of understanding how the Jones polynomial can be understood in terms of quantum theory. ",

And in the 1980s, there were many, many discoveries about the Jones polynomial, many of which related to theoretical physics in one way or another.  In fact, almost Jones' first work involved relating the Jones polynomial to what's called the temporarily leave algebra of statistical mechanics.  Anyway, there was a huge diversity of clues involving different relationships of the Jones polynomial to different kinds of mathematical physics.  Some were not terribly close to things I knew, but some were close to things I knew.  And well, my experience is it's hard to get things right the first time.
