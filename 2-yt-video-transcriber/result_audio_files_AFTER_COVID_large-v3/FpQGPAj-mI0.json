            "text": "We want to go to the phones.  We have Marky, who actually is part of our Facebook audience and watching from Genesee up in Palouse country.  Hi, Marky.  How are you?  Hey, I'm doing pretty well.  I'm a little bit chilly.  Are you a little bit cold right now?  Mid 40s earlier this morning.  So, yeah, it's a little bit nippy here.  Oh, I was just referring because because we're in the cold open for the not even a show right now.  I work for NEAS.  I do the cold open.  My name's Murky.  And so we're in the cold open right now.  And I just do need a little bit of help from you to make sure this goes smooth.  Now, what do you mean cold open?  What what what what what what what are you talking about?  Well, the cold open is what happens before the show actually starts.  And then again, it's not even a show, actually, so it is kind of confusing.  But basically, all you need to say is, let's start the show.  Well, we've started the show, so what point would you like to... Wait, okay.  Marky, what's the deal here?  Tell me, just level with me.  What's going on?  First off, my name's murky.  And if I want it, I'll level with you.  Basically, this is my job and stoop is trying to take it from me.  And I have a contract that only lasts two more weeks and I really need to get good cold opens.  And otherwise there's no chance that they'll renew my contract and stoop will be the man and everyone will suffer.  Okay.  Murky.  I have no idea what that was all about, but I, can somebody explain that to me?  I'm not sure what just happened.  Sorry if you thought it so, but this is not even a show.  I'm sorry if you thought it so, but this is not even a show.  I'm sorry if you thought it so, but this is not even a show.  We've got the pranks, we've got the songs, and all of that is good to go But the fact remains that this shit is still not a show Hey everyone, and then you say, hey is what horses eat, and then I say, oops, I mean hello, and then you say, thank you, or hello everyone, it's me, MMC, for another edition of the Not Even a Show, and I am still looking to find my wife, who was kidnapped by my arch-nemesis, Colonel Dufri, who also purported to have killed Gord, who is a Canadian hitman that I sent to kill him.  I'm actually getting reports now, though, that maybe Gord isn't dead.  And I'm also hearing maybe that Gord also might just be a figment of my imagination and part of my personality.  But honestly, who cares?  Let's get on to the episode, and it is an absolute banger, as we've got calls to Alex Jones, Chris X, Larry Elder, and a new UK host named Dan Wooten.  Plus, Steve-O-Path the Cop calls the Mark Kay Show.  First, though, sometimes on the channel something happens that's truly incredible and it's magical and today is one of those days as Tom Gulley officially joins the Prank Stars and makes his first ever prank call to J.J.  McCartney.  Check it out.  All right, welcome back.  Friday, the 3rd of July, J.J.  McCartney with the Mysterious Colonel.  We've got Robert on the line in Chicago, and we've got area code 435 on the line as well.  Hello, welcome to the show.  Hey, Colonel, how are you doing today?  Hey, how are you?  Who are we talking to?  Welcome to the show.  My name's Tom.  I'm calling from the very remote mountains of Utah.  Utah.  Hello, Tom.  Utah.  Very nice.  Yeah, I was I was calling in because we've had zero incidences of the coronavirus here.  So we've been upgraded to condition green.  We're allowed to have team sports and the political correctness.  It's just gone through the roof.  We actually at our first practice, people were talking about us wearing masks while we were playing.  And it got even worse.  They said for me to get a jersey and play on this team, I had to call in and say shirt.  Ah, yeah.  Ah, yeah.  Ah, yeah.  Well, you know, Tom, I know that there's a high concentration of mentally retarded people in Utah.  that that that that that that that that.  Not only do they play, they play these sports with helmets on, but as I understand it, they also wear helmets around the house, things like that.  Probably a Canadian transplant.  We kind of figured it was going to go there.  Hey, how are you?  Hey, how are you?  Yeah, that's probably one of Chris and Vancouver's gay lovers.  so um so um so um because you know.  so um i'm sorry but yeah you know it's only two things that come from canada.  um good lord.  yeah Larry Elder is a very popular right-wing radio host who has one of the worst green screen setups that you've ever seen and constantly has tech issues with his phone calls.  And when you have tech issues, you know who you're going to get a call from.  It's the man known as Tech Head Terry.  Check it out.  888-971-SAGE is the number.  Terry is in Idaho.  Terry, you're on the Larry Yoda Show.  Thank you so much for calling.  Hey, thank you so much for taking my call.  Larry, I appreciate it.  How are you tonight?  I'm doing well.  That's good.  Man, you got such a cool studio.  I love watching the live stream.  You're having some issues with the live stream on the main page.  It's up now, which is good.  I'm checking you out, though, as I do every night of the week.  I'm curious, though, what kind of mic y'all working with there?  What kind of mic is this, John?  What kind of mic is this?  You've already asked the question about my pay grade.  I'll find out.  Hold on a second.  What do you call it?  Annoyment?  Does that make any sense?  Oh, annoyment.  Okay.  That's cool.  I'm not sure.  That sounds like a good Brent.  Is that a green screen?  Is that a real studio?  It might be a stupid question.  Is it green screen?  Is that a real studio?  No, it's green screen.  No, it's green screen.  We project that on there.  Oh, it's green screen.  Yeah, yeah.  That's cool.  You know what's cool?  You can actually do it with blue as well, not just green.  You can do blue.  It's called chroma key, and it's very, very cool.  It allows somebody like you to appear to be in this very cool Miami-style studio, which I just absolutely love.  Wow.  Well, I wasn't even sure it was going to work when we started doing these because as far as I'm concerned, you're looking at somebody sitting in a chair into a mic.  It seems to me that would be boring, but we're doing a lot of things with visual and special effects and showing special effects.  When I play a clip, like I'm going to play this black pastor in Houston in a second, we have the clip, and so you can actually see him saying it.  So it's beginning to resemble a real TV show.  Apparently, you're muted on the YouTube stream.  That's what they're saying in the chat.  You seem to be having tech issues.  I wish I could get in there and have a damn look around.  What kind of microphone arm are you working with?  Sean, what kind of microphone is this?  you said this was?  What kind of microphone is this?  Not the microphone arm.  What kind of microphone arm are you working with?  And the monitor, too.  What kind of monitor are you all working with?  Exactly.  You know, Terry, look, Terry, I'll put you on hold.  You can ask my engineer all these questions.  I have no idea.  I'm the kind of guy, you give me the key to the car, I turn it, I expect the motor to work, and I put it in gear and I go.  It's called an H-E-I-L-P-R-40, which is what this microphone is called.  Last week, Steve O'Path, the cop, took the world by storm with his call to Joe Messina, and this week he was back at it again as he called another right-wing bootlicker, Mark Kay, and actually got to complaining before he even got on the air.  Check it out.  So Steve on line three is super pissy.  He's apparently a police officer that's called a few times.  Yeah.  Super upset that he's been on hold for 45 minutes.  And then what does he want to talk about?  A police perspective on shoot.  I mean, he hung up and then called back.  So I lost all the comments on it.  But it's a police perspective on all cops are bad.  Okay, that's fine.  I mean, tell him we apologize, but we don't just, you know.  And it's not our open line Wednesday or whatever.  We do it when we can.  He was very vocal about wanting priority over other callers.  Okay.  Oh, oh, oh.  855-765-1045.  Thanks for the call.  This is Steve.  What's up, Steve?  How are you?  Thanks for calling the Markay Show.  Oh, hi, Mark.  Oh, hi, Mark.  I don't know if you were briefed, but I'm law enforcement.  I'm a police officer here in Jacksonville.  I didn't do it.  I didn't do it.  Whatever it was, it was the other Josh.  That's funny, but honestly, I found it kind of peculiar.  You discuss your respect for the police, but yet you leave me on hold for 45 minutes and take a bunch of other phone calls, and it's strange.  I think you knew I was a police officer, yet you didn't take my call, and that is quite telling in these times, you know, the lack of respect that we have as police officers.  Well, hold on one second.  That's not fair at all, because I didn't know you were a police officer until you just told me.  You said no, and the lie detector test determined, Ralph, that was a lie.  And also... You did know.  You did know.  I heard in the break you talking about it.  You absolutely knew.  You're a liar.  I don't know why you're lying to me.  I'm on your side, Mark.  Why are you lying to me?  Your mic is on during the break.  I don't feel like you are.  I heard you talking to the producer, and you said to him that you knew I was a police officer.  He said it to you on the live stream.  Look, I'm looking at your body language right now, too, and I don't love it, Mark.  I don't love your body language.  Do you have an issue with me, sir?  I do have an issue with you.  I have an issue with you attacking me.  First of all, I haven't taken but three phone calls all day, and we don't just jump.  Why should I take your call first?  I get that you're law enforcement, and we appreciate that you're law enforcement, and we appreciate what you do.  You don't appreciate it that much.  You don't appreciate it that much if you're just going to take two other calls from civilians before me.  Nobody respects us, and you don't respect us, and you should, because we're normal, level-headed people, Mark.  You're level-headed.  Listen, you have such a lip and such an incredible \u2013 you just love to be a little smart-ass, don't you?  Steve, I'm just \u2013 I'll tell you what.  I'm curious why you're \u2013 what was your comment, though, originally?  Why did you call?  I called in to say it's unfair how police are being painted as these psychopathic people who are out here railing against these protesters.  Right, and I feel like I'm on your side with that.  That's literally my message.  You're not on my side!  You're not on my side!  Nobody's on my side!  Okay, hang on.  Hang on one second, Steve.  We're going to... We're going to talk to you a little bit later.  8-5-6-5-7-5-4-1-0-5.  You're not on my side.  You're not on my side.  We're excited to announce that starting in August, we will be doing a not even a show UK edition once a month for all of the UK viewers.  And just to kick things off a little bit, we thought we'd give you a banger from across the pond as we call Dan Wooten.  Check it out.  Boris is right in appointing people that will keep him moving this country forward, not who will sabotage this country, which we have all seen.  Brian is in Manchester.  Brian, your view on this?  Hi, Dan.  Pleasure to talk to you.  I really love the show.  Thank you for listening, Brian.  No worries.  Actually, my favourite magazine is gave you an award as the radio personality of the lockdown.  I don't know if you spotted it.  Oh my goodness, no, I didn't.  What magazine is it?  It was Hip Shit magazine.  Well, I need it.  Brian, what do you think about... Let's just go to this news out of Hong Kong.  The only host who's been featured longer on the channel than Chris X is JJ McCartney himself.  That's right.  Chris X is an old school host.  He seems like a shock jock, but I promise you he is a piece of shit.  And we call them with a quick two hitter.  Check it out.  Yeah, I think I caught a crank caller, too.  I asked him what part of where he was calling from.  He said Houston.  And I said, what part of Houston?  And he hung up.  Good job.  A little trouble there, Chris.  Busted him.  Good job.  Let's go to Tim in the Woodlands.  Tim, thanks for hanging on.  Welcome to The Voice of Texas.  Hi, Chris X. Big fan.  And I hate to do this, but I was wondering if you can do me a favor.  Can you please wipe the grease off of your forehead?  I can try.  Yeah, sure.  Thank you for the call.  I didn't.  Is that chicken grease from what I had earlier?  My point disproven.  What I just said, remember the intellectual discourse that you can't have?  There's a prime example.  Let's go to Jack in River Oaks.  Jack, thanks for hanging on.  Welcome to The Voice of Texas.  Hey, Chris.  I just wondered if you could please wipe that grease off your forehead.  Well, the internet shows guys are back.  Thanks for the call, Jack.  Yeah, Captain Jack, you're going to have to watch out for them.  It's their little internet show guys, and clearly they're back.  That's right.  Say $500 an hour.  So what's the deal with the greasy forehead?  What's funny is you were right.  You caught one of them, and what they did is they turned right around and called back in.  There's an internet show, and that's what they're waiting for me to talk about it right now because they're going to clip this, clip this, clip this, clip this, and put it on their show.  I can never remember the guy's name.  It's a YouTube channel called Not Really a Show or something.  They'll get them really mad, and then they clip it and put it on there, and they call in and say crazy stuff.  So what happens is you caught one of them earlier, so then they had two of them called right back in.  That's why they got in.  So they'll just come up.  They're the ones that will call in and ask if I'm an alien or whatever.  Anyway, I never get mad.  Watching these other hosts lose their mind over them is kind of funny.  No, they look it up.  They're based out of Canada, I think.  I was watching Brain Force reviews on YouTube and thinking about Brain Force.  That's a dietary supplement that Alex Jones sells.  And so I decided, let's take a little Brain Force and see what happens.  And it was not good.  And I actually have Alex Jones' cell phone number, so I called him to tell him about my issues with the product.  Check it out.  Brain Force Plus.  Personally recommended by me at InfoWars.  Hey, who's this?  Yeah, it's Brain Force.  My dick fell off.  I just want to gain... More thoughts inside my brain.  The price was quite high, but I gave it a try.  Then something happened just as fast as a car.  I took some brain force and my dick fell off.  All right, everybody, that's the end, and bless you.  Blessings and bless you for watching.  If you want to watch more, head over to patreon.com.  slash not even a show.  We've got a great bonus episode for you as Steve O'Pathicobb calls into the majority report with Sam Seder to defend himself against some of the slander that's been happening online.  Plus, the return of John Hopwood on the Matt Connerton show and a great three, four, five call.  to Colton at the Bubba Army.  Anyways, thanks so much, and I love you all, and thank you for letting me do this, and you're wonderful, and you have a wonderful week as well.  Is the kissing thing?  I should stop that, right?  Oh, you already, yeah, you told me to stop it already.  In the end, I didn't know.  I just listened and done. ",
