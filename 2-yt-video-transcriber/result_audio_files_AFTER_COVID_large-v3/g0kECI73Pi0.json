            "text": "What makes a song good?  Many have tried to answer this question, but often find the subjective nature of music difficult to describe.  Within the lens of US American pop music, it often feels like the success of a song is defined by how many people empathize with it.  Capitalism has ways of influencing which songs are heard through marketing campaigns and distribution, but I'm not referring to that in this video.  Within genres of folk, pop, and other types of music that stem from those traditions, songs travel far and wide to empathize with people for many different reasons.  This precedent of empathy also leads to many criticisms of pop music.  Some argue that the fact that many people empathize with a particular piece of music is indicative of how shallow or simplistic it is.  One of the more common mainstream criticisms of music from pop and folk traditions is that the harmonic structures are simplistic, with many songs sharing similar chords.  I've always thought this argument was missing the point.  I think the fact that millions of people can play the same four chords over and over again and keep making new things is a testament to the beauty of the human experience.  I think lyrics can also work in a similar way.  If someone can write a song and have so many people empathize with their personal experience, isn't that a testament to how their words are able to reach others?  I think there is something to be said for the songs that become hits, the songs that become widespread through a variety of cultures and resonate with lots of people.  That being said, my short answer to what makes a song good would be that a good song is just a song that you think is good.  My videos are just my opinions.  But wait, don't click away from this video yet.  I think it's possible to analyze those songs that have become widespread hits and look at which factors allowed them to become timeless classics.  So let's talk about why I think Rainbow Connection is a Muppet masterpiece. ",

            "text": "It's fun to be free.  On May 31st, 1979, the Muppet movie was released in the United Kingdom.  As the franchise's first foray into the feature-length film business, it was a complete success.  After a brief intro of the Muppets themselves sitting down to watch a movie together, the film begins with the shot featuring the song Rainbow Connection.  The shot slowly zooms in as Kermit the Frog sings about rainbows, hope, and what it means to believe in something.  Having made a name for themselves within witty television comedy, The Muppets going full-on ballad might have seemed an odd choice at the time, but it was all part of a deliberate plan.  Written by Kenny Asher and Paul Williams, the song was meant from the start to show a side of Kermit that had not been seen before by audiences.  Rainbow Connection was the first number in the Muppet movie.  It's the one that establishes the lead character.  We find Kermit sitting in the middle of the swamp.  Kenny Asher and I sat down to write these songs and we thought, Kermit, he's like every frog.  He's the Jimmy Stewart of frogs.  So how do we show that he's a thinking frog and that he has an introspective soul and all that good stuff?  We looked at his environment and his environment is water and air and light and it just seemed like it would be a place where he would see a rainbow.  But we also wanted to show that he would be on the spiritual path examining life and the meaning of life.  Though the Muppets had not been bought by Disney by the time it came out, the song also took inspiration from the Disney catalog, specifically the song When You Wish Upon a Star from Pinocchio.  By showing an introspective side of Kermit the Frog that mirrored Jiminy Cricket, the writers could expand the Muppet universe to not just be filled with funny characters, but well-rounded ones.  And that's it, really.  The song was sung in this movie, and then it became a timeless classic.  Perhaps the song's mainstream acceptance had to do with the fact that many celebrities covered it, but the fact that the Muppet version is still played frequently shows that it's more than that.  But how does a song written for the Muppet movie become an international hit that's even played at people's weddings?  Well, for starters, the song's melody is mostly diatonic.  In other words, if you put the melody in C major, a majority of the notes will fit on the white keys of the keyboard.  This helps the melody be easily sung by others, as it doesn't require a lot of chromatic motion.  For instance, Disney theme park melodies are often diatonic, making them easy to grasp without having to hear them many times.  In terms of finding some concrete musical way to explain why Rainbow Connection is such an earworm, that might be the best place to look.  So, it's a pop song written in an accessible, traditional pop-slash-folk format.  But what do the lyrics say?  Despite its name, Rainbow Connection is less about rainbows themselves and more about faith as a concept.  Throughout the song, Kermit sings about what rainbows are, referencing the pop culture trope of rainbows representing hope.  When I hear the song, the first thing that comes to mind is Over the Rainbow from The Wizard of Oz, a song that leans into the notion of rainbows providing hope and a form of escape.  However, that's not the point of the song.  Kermit goes on to question the origin of this belief, saying that it's not necessarily rainbows that are magical, but the belief that's put into them.  People often believe things because they're conditioned to, but is that the way to go?  Kermit questions this, but also acknowledges the beauty in believing in something, and how connected we all are through that experience.  In an interview with the Tennesseans, songwriter Paul Williams described the elegance of the song's lyrics. ",

Rainbows are visions, only illusions.  Rainbows have nothing to hide.  I went, oh, that's brilliant.  Now we've written ourself into a corner here where we've denied any magic and rainbows.  But then we turned it around.  So we've been told, and some choose to believe it.  I know the wrong way to see.  Someday we'll find it.  Someday we'll find it.  In other words, Kermit doesn't have the answers.  The heart of the song, Bart, to me is in the lines, who said that every wish would be heard and answered if wished on the morning star.  Somebody thought of that, and someone believed it.  Look what it's done so far.  I think that in that line is the essence of what is my philosophy, and I hope it was accurate for Kermit, is that there is just immense power in faith, that there's more beauty in the questions than there are in the answers.

When I started writing songs, the point of the songwriting was for me to take all of these big feelings and create something small so that I could have a tangible product out of what was inside me.  When I started to share that with people, the purpose of my songwriting changed because where these songs felt like they were for me.  They were still so vague, like you talked about vagueness, that it wasn't just for me, it was for whoever wanted to listen.  The first time I heard Rainbow Connection, my elementary school music mentor was this woman.  She's like the band teacher, but I wasn't doing band because I was in the story ensemble.  but she still like really like cared about me and my parents like became friends with her outside of school and she's a jazz singer and her ensemble performed Rainbow Connection and I was like moved by the spirit of that song.  I was like.  I don't really understand what this is but there's something so special that like yeah it like incites hope.  I think something that's super cool.  is that, like, maybe I just don't know what it is, but, like, the way that, like, the lyrics are, like, we'll find it, the rainbow connection.  It asks you to, like, know what that is and what that means, even though, like, I don't know that phrase in any other context.  But, like, I think I know what he's talking about. ",

            "text": "At the end of the day, Rainbow Connection is barely a song about rainbows.  It's a song about believing in something and feeling connected to others because of it.  The vague lyrics about faith work so well because they are vague.  The notion of longing is such a human emotion that almost anyone can see themselves in it.  In terms of songwriting, Rainbow Connection is a masterpiece because it is a mirror.  It's a mirror for the human experience, emphasizing the fact that we are all united by simply existing.  The song wonderfully blurs the line between having a concrete narrative like Kermit's perspective and inviting listeners to hear themselves in the song.  I really think that few songs articulate longing better than Rainbow Connection.  After all of the introspection, the song always invites you back, reminding you that everyone is part of the question it's posing.  The lovers, the dreamers, and me.  Rainbow Connection is a Muppet masterpiece because, like Paul Williams said, there's more beauty in the questions than the answers. ",
