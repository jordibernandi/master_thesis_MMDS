            "text": "All lives matter!  All lives matter!  The American police state brought to you by questionable authority.  Your freedom is an illusion.  Welcome back for a new video and if you're new, welcome to the channel in general.  The video I'm highlighting today comes from the Gilbert Bystander.  His channel is new and he's a believer in freedom and deserves more subscribers than he has.  I'll link to his channel in the original video or in the description.  Go check him out and if you like his content, subscribe and let him know Questionable Authority sent you.  I'm showing this video because it highlights yet again how if you don't fit into the two party paradigm our masters strive to have us plugged into, you're a cog that doesn't fit into the system of servitude and must be harassed and punished until you do or they've taken everything from you so you resort to using what they provide for your survival.  don't fall into the trap.  To borrow from an old adage, don't accept the free gift of fish.  Accept the help to survive and be free.  Be thankful and then use that love and kindness to learn to catch your own fish and help others do the same.  If there are only two groups or ideas to choose from, it's easy for the ruling class to pit us against each other.  For example, I don't really believe the current political climate is about liking either one of the current presidential candidates or their respective parties.  Instead, our media and the talking heads they shove in front of you for your fake corporate-backed news make it about you hating something about the opposition.  That way you don't actually have to focus on the lying psychopath politician you support on the other side of the two-party paradigm.  All you have to do is recognize that you hate, or at least are very emotionally opposed, to one or two ideals on one side, and then you're presented with an opposition to that.  And most people's cognitive dissonance will keep them from realizing what they're supporting doesn't really align with their ideals of freedom and liberty.  It's simply the lesser of two evils and is the opposition to the option they really don't like.  When there's only two options presented and we're told our vote is what matters in deciding between them, most will happily choose what they consider the lesser of two evils simply to, in their mind, prevent what they oppose.  On this video, an observer is documenting the happenings in Gilbert, Arizona, where there's a weekly BLM versus Back the Blue rally.  At these rallies, just like all over the country, the two opposing sides of the paradigm are split up and have dividers erected to symbolize the differences.  then anyone in the area must determine which side they're on and will be directed to the corresponding cult location.  You're not allowed to be undecided and have conversations with both sides to determine your stance and come to understandings with other people.  No, in this American police state, you must pick your side or be harassed, threatened, and possibly tortured and thrown into a cage in order to gain your compliance to the established system.  Tell me that's not exactly what's happening here.  I hope you get something from this video.  Leave me a comment with your thoughts, hit the like button, reblog and share this video on all your social media, and subscribe to the channel. ",
