            "text": "The walls are closing in on the deep state, California dictatorship takes a hit, and fake news is alive as ever.  Hello, I'm Mike Huckabee, and this is this week's Breakdown.  Well, if you've subscribed to my newsletter on mikehuckabee.com, you would have read my summary of the 88-page transcript of a House Intel Committee interview with CrowdStrike cybersecurity expert Sean Henry.  It's a huge story that, sadly, most of the media will bury under a pile of bar-bashing and scary coronavirus stories.  Really, though, this story is arguably the scariest one of all because it shows that our country has spent the past several years in the grip of a different kind of contagion, mass hysteria.  And yet, you have so-called media watchdogs like Brian Stelter over at CNN upset because conservatives are actually covering this breaking news on government corruption.  Let's watch. ",

            "text": "It's so disappointing to look at what we're seeing from right-wing media these days where there's such an obsession with the deep state and these revelations about the Russia probe and the decision about Michael Flynn.  They're treating the Michael Flynn story like it's a bigger deal than the deaths of 2,000 Americans a day. ",

            "text": "I'm sure this somehow makes me a bigot, but I'm pretty sure covering is exactly what the media is supposed to do with news, not covering up.  And I feel confident in saying that this evidence of deep-seated corruption at the top levels of government fits the description of newsworthy.  By Brian Stelter's own standards, CNN shouldn't be breathing a word about the shooting of Ahmaud Arbery and the evident cover-up by the prosecution in Glynn County.  Do you know why the media is taking a break from coronavirus to cover that story?  That's right, because it's newsworthy.  But Brian Stelter isn't highly partisan along with the rest of CNN at all, which is why they're not gonna be giving much time, if any, to the news that testimony of CrowdStrike's Sean Henry was hidden for three years.  And it reveals that the lie that the Democrats have told since 2016 goes beyond the phony assertion that there is evidence that Trump was in cahoots with Vladimir Putin while running for president.  They also lied when they said that there was evidence of the Russian government trying to hurt Hillary by hacking DNC emails.  According to Henry, the one in charge of CrowdStrike's investigation, they found no direct evidence, only indications and assumptions.  But a Russian hack fits the narrative, and the DNC is evidently highly susceptible to confirmation bias.  When Henry was brought in by Clinton lawyer and helpful dirt disher Michael Sussman to handle the remediation, it was Sussman who told it that the FBI had already found indications that caused them to suspect the Russian government, essentially handing Henry the client's preferred narrative on a silver platter.  The fact is, we don't know if Russia hacked the emails of the DNC and John Podesta, who was head of Hillary's campaign.  Maybe they did.  Maybe somebody else did.  But there is no evidence that they did, despite Representative Adam Schiff's incessant claims to the contrary.  This is a dangerous man, and I don't mean only if you get between him and a TV camera.  Over and over he has claimed there is evidence in plain sight about Russian collusion with the Trump team.  It is an abominable lie, but Schiff tells this so often, I think he must be using Lenin's strategy of a lie told often enough becomes the truth.  I have my own version to offer Mr.  Schiff.  A lie told often enough just makes you that much more of a dirty liar.  Now to stick to his fake story.  while maintaining he's telling the truth, Schiff is trying to claim that the evidence in plain sight is the Trump Tower meeting.  Oh yeah, that's the ticket.  Because we all know that meeting took place.  It involved Trump campaign people and some Russians.  So all right, collusion.  But recall that in mid-2017, the media and Democrats, but I repeat myself, were going crazy about the Trump Tower meeting with Russians.  And the media scoffed at Don Trump  Jr.'s  account that they were meeting about a Russian lobbying campaign that would change adoption practices under a human rights law called the Magnitsky Act.  Naturally, his story couldn't be true because it would mean that they were doing something good.  Well, as it turns out, the media and Democrats were wrong on this one, too, if they weren't just outright lying.  John Solomon of Just the News uncovered FBI memos that detailed an interview with a trusted translator for the State Department who was present at the Trump Tower meeting.  It was a man by the name of Anatoly Samochornov.  Now, I'm only going to say his name once, in part because it's kind of a hard one to pronounce.  He corroborated the account of Don Jr.  that the meeting, in fact, had been about the Magnitsky Act.  He also said there was no talk of dirt on Hillary Clinton, and he doesn't recall her name even being mentioned at all.  Of course, this is very significant exculpatory evidence that was conveniently left out of the Mueller report.  A Senate staffer involved in the Russia investigation told John Solomon.  the omission from the Mueller report leaves a distorted picture that has been allowed to persist for more than two years.  We're looking into the circumstances of the editing of that report and why the Department of Justice allowed such investigations and false public narratives to carry on in the face of significant evidence of innocence.  So they don't have evidence of collusion, but they lie and say they do.  They do have evidence of innocence.  but they lie by omission and they leave that out.  This farce has gone on long enough.  Thankfully, Acting Director of National Intelligence Rick Grinnell is calling for the release of more and more long-withheld evidence that, sure enough, is turning out to be exculpatory.  And no amount of spinning by ship, or even President Obama, who with the recent revelations about his knowledge about the Michael Flynn debacle, is desperate now to keep the lid on his own role in the plot to take down President Trump.  None of that will stop us from calling a lie a lie.  Well, in other liberal news, for years, Californians have been pushing their state further and further to the left, and even imposing heavy-handed restrictions on businesses long before the pandemic.  But California's authoritarian tendencies, after successfully flattening the curve, may be coming back to bite them.  But before I get to that, why don't you take a moment to subscribe to the channel and hit the notification bell so that you'll always know when we've got another video up just for you.  And by the way, we'd love for you to leave a like and a comment if you're enjoying the video so far.  Well, like I was saying, Californians have voted further and further to the left for years.  As they have, they've watched their borders be erased, illegal alien criminals being welcomed and released from jail.  Their taxes and gas prices skyrocket because of taxes that are the result of harsh energy policies.  All the while, the homeless population exploded.  And public sanitation became so bad in California that parks and sidewalks have become covered in feces and drug needles.  And ancient diseases such as typhus have made a return.  Affordable housing?  Impossible to find.  And small business owners are fleeing to other states.  Some areas such as Silicon Valley have reverted to an era of feudalism where the wealthy tech lords protected by security walls and armed guards in their castles while denouncing security walls and guns for anyone else.  All the while, the serfs who work for them shelter in tiny dwellings or even in their cars.  Not content with driving out the middle class and small business owners in the name of helping the workers, leftist leaders in California passed AB5, which is killing the growing gig economy, as it's called.  That makes it impossible for contract workers like. ",
