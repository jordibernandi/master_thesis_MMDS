            "text": "It's a miracle that we breathe.  It's a miracle that Hashem has patience to still give us oxygen to breathe.  No matter how many generations you hear, you're always going to be guessed.  This is the way Hashem made the world.  The Jews will never have a place on their own.  Even in Israel, the Jews are guests as long as Hashem wants.  It's a pasuk in the Torah.  That I'm giving you the land, and I'm kicking the goyim away from the land, but the land will not be yours permanently, it will be yours conditionally.  Lo timaker haaretz netzmitut kili haaretz.  I'm giving you the land only as long as you listen to me and you follow my rules.  If you're going to become goyim, if you become idol worshippers, if you become people who makes all the, you know, the worst despicable sins of the Torah, especially abomination and all that, the land will vomit you out.  That's what's written.  That's what's written.  You're now welcome inside.  And when the land vomit us to all over the world and we all leave and we run away, that means that we don't deserve to live in the Holy Land.  So it's unbelievable.  We are stuck now between heaven and earth.  We're stuck.  On one hand, we can't be going.  On the other hand, we're not following the Torah.  We're stuck.  So we're going to have to make a decision.  Which side do you want to be on?  You want to be a real Jew and go all the way or you want to be a Goy and then nobody will know even that you used to be a Jew, your children will all be Goyim and it will be the end of you.  This is what's going on right now.  Hashem is already in a time of serious judgment now.  The mood in Shamayim from this last Rosh Hashanah, few months ago, has changed. ",

            "text": "The prophet Yehezkel, known among all of the nations, prophet who resurrected the dead, meaning the resurrection of the dead happened a couple of times in history already.  There's one at the time of Moshe Rabbeinu, where Am Yisrael was at Mount Sinai, and every time HaKadosh Baruch Hu said the commandment, the holiness of his voice was so extraordinary that no one aside from Moshe Rabbeinu was able to handle it.  So everyone died.  Hashem resurrected them.  He said the second commandment, they died again.  Hashem resurrected them, and then they told Moshe Rabbeinu, you go talk to him, we'll do whatever he says.  We'll listen, we'll do, no problem.  Why?  Because if you continue talking, we'll die again.  And death is painful.  It's not like it looks in the movies, the guy goes to sleep and he dies.  Doesn't look, it's not like that.  That's just the movies.  In reality, death is painful.  Unless you're a tzaddik.  If you're a tzaddik, it's like taking off your clothes and going to a different room.  You know, you take off your suit, put on pajamas.  That's not dying, for a tzaddik.  Someone's not exactly a tzaddik, someone's not exactly a tzaddika, death is painful.  Yecheh goes and he sees there's hundreds of skeletons.  No flesh, nothing.  They called it dry bones.  And HaKadosh Baruch Hu miraculously puts flesh back on these bones.  But these bones and these now bodies don't have any life in them.  he says in the section uh chapter 37. he says so.  i prophesied in chapter 37 verse 7. so i prophesied as i had been commanded.  there was a sound as i was prophesizing.  then behold there was a noise and the bones drew near each bone to its matching bone.  Then I looked, and behold, upon them were sinews, and flesh had come up, and skin had covered them over.  But there was no spirit in them.  Then he said to me, Prophecy to the spirit, prophecy, O son of man, and say to the spirit, Thus said the Lord Hashem, come from the four directions, O spirit, and blow into these slain people, that they may come to life.  I prophesized as I had been commanded, and the Spirit entered them, and they came to life.  They stood upon their feet, a very, very great legion.  In verse number 8, in this section about the dry bones... Where it says, Then I looked, and behold, upon them were snooze, and flesh had come upon, and skin had covered them over, but there was no spirit in them.  In the section where Ezekiel says there's a body, but there's no soul.  You'll find the virus corona. ",

He wants us to learn Musal from all of the other people that are making mistakes that are part of the nation that he's given them coronavirus.  They're fighting with each other.  They're promiscuous with each other.  They're eating everything that moves and everything that doesn't move.  They're going against Hashem by worshipping idols.  They're going against Hashem by worshipping money.  They're doing all the things that we as a nation are forbidden to do.  And if we want truly a cure, the cure starts with the person you see in the mirror.  Thank you. ",
