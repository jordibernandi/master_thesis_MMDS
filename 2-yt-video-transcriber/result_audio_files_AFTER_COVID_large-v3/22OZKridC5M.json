What do you say to the tens of millions of people who are going to lose their benefits when it appears that the real issue is that Republicans cannot agree among themselves, even though they've had months?  That's not it at all.  In fact, Democrats offered a $3 trillion plan.  We have a very specific focus right now, and it's not this comprehensive plan, whether it be the HEROES Act the Democrats proposed that was unserious or the HEALS Act.  That narrow focus is this.  that Americans are about to lose their unemployment insurance.  And this White House, this Chief of Staff, this President, this Secretary of the Treasury have offered several iterations to make sure that Americans who, through no fault of their own, lost their jobs during this pandemic do not also lose these checks.  We've made several proposals, as Mark Meadows just said to you.  And how many proposals have the Democrats made?  Zero.  And it If you want to know where the Democrats' true intentions lie, look no further than the Martha McSally bill that was presented that would have extended the $600 unemployment insurance.  It was rejected by Chuck Schumer, and that was a plan that the President was willing to endorse. ",

And I would refer you to a post on Herman Cain's website.  And he says, I realize, or his website rather, I realize people will speculate about the Tulsa rally, but Herman did a lot of traveling the past week.  I don't think there's any way to trace this to one specific contact that caused the infection.  We'll never know.  I will not politicize Herman Cain's passing and I would just note the great contributions he's made to our society.  We'll always remember him and his legacy will stand. ",

When it comes to the FBI building, this has been a long discussed issue.  I would note that the three previous COVID bills that have been passed had plenty of other things in them that were not related to COVID.  One of those examples is the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund.  This is not a red line for us.  It was a part of the initial bill, but it is certainly not a red line.  The priority, as I've said several times so far, is unemployment insurance, making sure Americans do not get evicted.  And then as it pertains to White House renovations, many of those pertain to safety protocols, filtration systems, enhanced communication ability and needs that we saw that were highlighted during the pandemic.  But make no mistake, a $377 million proposal will not stand in the way of ensuring that the American people get their checks.  That is the priority, ensuring that Americans do not get evicted.

Can you explain why the White House did not counter with a comprehensive plan of its own?  You said the White House was focused on two things.  the unemployment insurance and evictions.  Why not have a more comprehensive proposal to counter what the Democrats have put on the table?  So I've walked through at this podium.  the more comprehensive plan that this White House was hoping to see in our priorities like tax rebates, unemployment benefits, enhanced hiring and retention, payroll credits, workplace tax credits, restaurant donations, and others.  Those are all part of the HEALS Act.  So there is a comprehensive plan that was put forward by Republicans on the Hill with several White House priorities in it.
