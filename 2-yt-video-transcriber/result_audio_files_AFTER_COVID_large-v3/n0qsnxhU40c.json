            "text": "Listen, David, the gold-silver ratio, let's talk about that first because it's 115 to 1 or thereabouts while we're doing this interview.  It hit over 120 to 1 at some point.  There's never been any period in recorded history going back to the early days of covering these elements that it was this sort of ratio.  Now, we all know since 1971, both metals don't back any national currencies, but more importantly, silver isn't.  held by any governments or central banks in contrast to gold.  Is this the major reason why we're seeing this discrepancy?  And do you see this as an opportunity for silver? ",

            "text": "Yes.  Let me just repeat a little bit.  I think he did an excellent open.  If you look at 5,500 years, 5,500 years of monetary history, it's only been in the last 120 years where the gold-silver ratio has been above 20.  If you go back to the start of the earliest recorded history, the gold-silver ratio is how many ounces of silver buys an ounce of gold.  And in ancient Egypt, two and a half ounces of silver bought an ounce of gold.  So here we are, we've been to 100 twice before, and we're over 120.  You said every time we've been to that level, it is forecast financial crisis.  So if you take that logic, you could, this is totally logical, that if it's at the highest it's ever been in over 5,000 years, does that portend the greatest financial crisis in recorded history?  I'll leave that as an open question.  Moving on, yes, if silver was treated like gold, which is the title of the latest speech I gave first in New Orleans at the gold show there, I gave it again in Vancouver,  B.C.,  and a third time at the Metals Investors Forum in Toronto.  I basically said that silver's power is money.  As an industrial commodity, it trades like an industrial commodity, similar to, say, platinum or palladium.  I mean, platinum is 15 times rarer than gold, so why doesn't it trade at 15 times the price of gold?  Well, because the market says it's worth this amount, and that's what it trades at.  Same thing with silver.  Not mentioning the manipulation, which I go into in my second book, The Silver Manifesto, and I don't really want to go down that path.  You can if you wish.  I'd rather just stay on the top surface level.  So if silver were treated like money and central banks held it, it would be a far higher price than it is right now.  The gold silver ratio, would be probably near the, what I call, classic of the monetary ratios at 16 to one.  But that's not the case.  The bankers have been against silver since the Civil War.  They've demonetized it in the crime of 1873.  That's what the whole thing was about with Williams, Jennings, Bryant.  And then, of course, the whole book about the Wizard of Oz was a big metaphor for the Eastern establishment going to a gold-only standard.  And the gold-only standard is one step to fiat, and there's a very great paper written by a gentleman that I never had the pleasure of meeting called Gold, One Step to Fiat.  So there's a lot to the story, and I don't want to go into a lot of detail, but that's my, I wouldn't even say theory, that's pretty much factually based whether or not having silver in the monetary system would have a different price.  I argue that it would, but some may argue against that. ",

            "text": "David, that is absolutely a great overview of this.  And now I wanna ask you about the paper market price because it's around 12 to 13, $14 an ounce.  So decoupled from the price that the bullion dealers are currently selling and resellers online are trading eagles and maples and numismatics.  For 22, 23, I've seen it as high as $40 an ounce of silver.  And I wonder what your thoughts are on this because if there's an arbitrage here, then perhaps even the better place to trade the options market with the SLV if you think that these premiums are going to shrink down to nothing.  meaning that the price already has a baked-in appreciation of about 80% here.  So tell us what you think, and does this have to do with the way that Trump is talking about opening the markets up?  In other words, is the silver play a reflation play instead of a hedge play for disaster? ",

            "text": "I don't know for certain.  What I can tell you is the history doesn't repeat, but it rhymes.  So in 2008, we had a very similar situation.  And a lot of people were saying that the delta between the retail price and the paper price on the COMEX was going to meet but their premise was that it would meet to the upside meaning that these large premiums on the retail side would be the standard and that the commercial bar silver would reach that price.  I said no and I wrote an article.  I said there is an arbitrage opportunity and the arbitrage is to buy silver which is you know commercial bar silver thousand ounce bars and then you could synthetically sell against it in the paper market.  The spread did narrow and it did exactly what I had forecast, which means it went back down to the silver price.  Not that I wanted it to do that, that's just how I saw the market at the time.  So there's lots of ways to do that.  One easy way that I took advantage of back then was I bought bars off the COMEX, had them delivered, actually I delivered to a mint friend of mine in Florida now, had them minted in the half ounce rounds and sold them at a huge premium.  I didn't sell a lot of them, but it's the way to capture the market.  So you could do that.  You could also do it synthetically.  This time, is it different?  The answer is I don't know.  But it'd really be interesting to see with the change that we're having this time, Lior.  I really think that, and maybe it's wishful thinking, that this could be it.  And the reason I say that is I just did my Mastermind series with... Nick Bereshef of BMG Group.  And he pointed out that just to get into gold, and gold is a much broader market than silver.  I mean, just to back step a bit, one of the slides in my presentation was produced for me by SRS Rocco, Steve San Angelo.  So let me shout out to Steve on the public domain here.  Thank you.  And he showed the pitiful amount of central banks holdings of silver.  which is $1.6 billion worth of silver, probably less than that at current prices.  And the current holding of central bank gold was 1.6 trillion.  So if banks looked at silver, treated silver as they treat gold as a monetary reserve asset, the ultimate money, the monetary hitching post of the universe, If they treated it in that manner, then I don't know how much it would own, but let's say it was an equal amount in fiat that is in dollars.  If 1.6 billion silver held by central banks equaled the 1.6 trillion in fiat value of gold, you would have to take that amount and multiply it by 1,000.  1,000 million is a billion, 1,000 billion is a trillion.  So 1.6 billion times 1,000 is 1.6 trillion.  Now I'm not saying the price of silver should be priced 1,000 times higher.  What I'm trying to point out is how small that market is and what the price level would in theory look like relative to where it is now.  So I'm still bullish on silver for the monetary aspect, love the industrial side as well, but I've always advocated that the silver price is going to be determined ultimately by its monetary value, not its industrial usage.

            "text": "OK, so COVID-19, obviously the most important topic on everyone's minds because it's just such a disruptor.  It's causing mine closures right now in South America, Peru, Chile.  I believe Argentina is shutting down some mines now.  And shutting down mines is not like turning off the faucet.  It takes months to then reopen it.  And obviously, there's a process to that.  From what I understand, judging off of one of the largest CEO miners in the world, we will have about 23% of the world's production halted.  or shut down in the next few weeks here.  How important is that?  Obviously with the New York shutdown imminent to the free flow and supply of silver, because we're already seeing all the bullion deals have a maximum of like 20K or 25K on orders and delayed orders and you can't get a lot of it.  and the numismatics have, they're selling over $2,000 an ounce for gold.  So what's gonna happen with the supply? ",

            "text": "Well, you said it, get a better job, probably too long-winded.  But with 25% rounded up, supply gone, you're going to have a lot of pressure in the physical market.  And you could get enough monetary demand that it actually puts pressure on the industrial side.  Yes, I know industry is... It's not come to a complete halt, but it's certainly slowed, and I get that.  But you also got to factor in the fact that you've got 25% closed down, and we're not even factoring in what's happening to the other mines, like lead, zinc, and copper mines that produce about 70% of the free silver.  So there's a lot to the story, and that puts a lot of pressure on the physical market.  And now there's delays in the physical market.  Maybe they're going to start up the iPhones in two months.  But they don't have enough silver on hand now, so they'll go into the market.  So that's kind of a side story, but it's applicable.  So I think it's actually going to help the miners in the long run, and here's why.  When the run the gold really gets serious, and that's when, I don't know.  It's when the psychology of the market changes, that the overall trends have changed.  The stock market generally is going down.  The gold is generally going up.  When that occurrence takes place and grabs another 1%, 2% of the investing money out there in the free market, quote unquote free market, and it starts moving into the gold market, you may see the miners, even if they're not producing, bought as a non-expiring call on the product.  I hope I'm making that clearly or I know how smart you are.  I know you get what I just said, but maybe you could rephrase it for our listeners.  But basically, if you buy a gold mine that's really low in price and not producing, it's still got the gold in the ground.  And a stock doesn't have an expiration date like a call option or a leap.  So you could be buying gold in the ground for like pennies on the dollar and just waiting for the industry to come back.  I think that's the worst case scenario.  But even the worst case I can think of, actually longer term, I think, could be bullish for some of these miners.  Now, I don't know.  No one knows how long they're going to be shut down.  But as you said, it's a real pain to get them back up.  That's why a lot of miners will keep producing at a loss over two or three quarters And on their books, why don't they shut down?  It's not a light switch.  It's cheaper in the long run.  These guys know what they're doing to take a loss for two or three quarters rather than shut down and start back up because doing that is more costly.  And that's why they will keep them going. ",

            "text": "Okay, so that's a great perspective on everything that's going on.  Obviously, we're already seeing miners, the mining stocks doing very good in large part because of the historic day that we're recording this.  Gold is up over like $100 per ounce.  It was below $1,500.  It's now over $1,600 as we're doing this interview.  Silver has gone from like $12 to $14 an ounce.  And on the face of that, you see stocks, bonds, everything's selling off the dollar, super strong, super, super strong, still a gold and silver look.  Really, really good.  So I want to ask you on the other side of this coronavirus.  Okay, Trump is already, you know, thinking like a great leader or like a strong leader.  He's saying, okay, if I listen to Fauci, the markets will never open.  Our country will always be closed until the last coronavirus is squashed like a bug.  So that's not going to happen.  Obviously, he wants to win an election.  Everyone in America is getting a check.  courtesy of Donald Trump, which is a great thing when there's an election here.  Biden's nowhere to be seen, probably doesn't have Wi-Fi in his house.  So politically, I see a lot of pressure on Trump to get this thing moving again.  And I think after the second stimulus bill and everything that's going on, they've already done everything that they can.  QE, open-ended, open-ended QE.  That's unlimited QE.  You have unlimited swap lines to Europe.  The central bank is flooding the markets with unlimited cash.  Literally, Nile Kashkari said, we have an unlimited amount of cash to give the markets.  So on the other side of this, is this the gold 2000 moment?  Is this the silver 30, $35 an ounce moment?  Is this the silver miners moment?  Because they're obviously going to be much more profitable relative to the other aspects of the economy than they used to be before this because hotels and airlines or everything like that, it's not going to come back to production and to full capacity as they did before.

            "text": "Yeah, I think it is.  I think you're exactly right.  I mean, if you look at some of the research that I've looked at and it's a lot, you can see the library.  Oh, you can't see it in this video, but anyway, professor Roy S. Jastrom wrote the golden constant and proved basically that gold does best in deflation.  A lot of the time that he looked at the gold situation, it was a, it was actually during a gold standard.  So you can't take that.  And anyway, all cases.  And then after writing that book, he wrote The Silver, the Restless Metal.  And basically the preface to that book says, if there's real inflation, there's only one place to go.  I'm paraphrasing.  Silver is the ultimate hedge in a highly inflationary environment.  So, you know, when you start mailing money to people for no reason, that's rather inflationary.  So we could see, and I think we will see, during this reset that's now started, a resetting of everything.  What's food price?  What's gas?  What's oil?  What's a house?  And what are the metals?  And I think that you're going to see substantially higher in the money metals, both gold and silver.  Perhaps platinum and palladium will come along for the ride.  I think they will.  Because you start calling your dealer and say, I want gold.  I don't have any.  I want silver.  I don't have any.  What have you got?  I've got 10 platinum coins.  I'll take them.  That kind of thing.  And those medals are extremely rare.  I was early on the palladium story, actually.  I got in at 600 level or so.  Unfortunately, where I got out early, still made a nice profit.  But I wish I would have held one more year, believe me. ",

I'm going to post two or three times today a way for you to buy silver pretty near the spot price without these exorbitant fees that you mentioned at the beginning of our interview.  You are buying silver.  You're buying part of a Comex bar, or if you're wealthy, you're buying the bars at a time.  And what you do is you hold that and wait for this arbitrage opportunity to come down.  So you cash it out and do the product like a silver Eagle or a silver round or a silver bar after the spread is narrowed back to normal.  So it's a good way to lock in silver, wait for this arbitrage to work in your favor and then cash out and whatever you want bars or coins. ",
