            "text": "I worry that the past two months of quarantine have given people the idea that the way for humans to win our million-year war with microbes is to avoid them completely.  And I'm here to tell you, you can't.  The key to beating COVID isn't dining through glass or never going to a concert or a ball game again.  It's your immune system.  You hear people say COVID-19 is a new virus, so the immune system doesn't know how to handle it.  Well, of course it does.  That's why the vast majority of people have had it, either recovered or didn't even know they had it.  What do you think did that?  The human immune system.  Now, there are people with immune systems that can't do the job, and we should make it a priority to protect those people.  but compulsively washing, being scared of your own hands, that can't become the new normal.  Microbes are ubiquitous.  You can keep discovering new places to scare people into buying protection for, but we're solving the problem from the wrong end.  This is a health problem.  We can't sanitize the universe.  Governors should declare keeping our bodies in good health an essential job, because that's the only way we are going to win this.  God knows what is all over your pets and in their mouth, and then you invite them on the bed and they try to French kiss you and sometimes succeed.  And some people don't even fight it.  But what's the point of a pet if you're not going to pet it?  It's in the name.  And what's the point of life if you can't live it?  So this weekend, do something nice for your immune system.  Go outside that mysterious land beyond your curtains where the Grubhub drivers live and get some fresh air and vitamin D and break a sweat doing something besides eating hot chicken.  Because at the end of the day, you can't keep all the pathogens out. ",
