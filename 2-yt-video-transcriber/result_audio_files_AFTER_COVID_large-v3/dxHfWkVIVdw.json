They went up the steps and they pretty much stopped.  Some people got in somehow and got into the, you know, the hall of statues or whatever.  But the fact that they didn't exploit that and the fact that they're stopped at the steps and... Evidently, D.C.  police or whoever is doing a really good job keeping them from getting reinforcements.  I mean, there's a bazillion people in D.C.  They should be coming to the Capitol, but they're not.  I submit they're probably being prevented from doing so somehow.  And the guys that are just hanging out at the top of the steps of the Capitol, you continue to improve your position.  You continue to push forward or you're going to get acted on.  That is what I think is about to happen.  All right.  Keep sounding those shofars. ",
