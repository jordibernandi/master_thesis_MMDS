            "text": "Hey, what's up, YouTube?  I'm sitting here in one of my favorite spots.  And as you can see behind me is this awesome area.  It's called Beijing Lu.  And right behind me there, you can kind of see one of the major intersections that crosses into Beijing Lu.  We're giving you this kind of cool background.  I thought you guys would really appreciate that, because usually in my apartment, the background's If this is your first time watching my videos, I just want to say welcome.  It's basically me giving you on the ground information about what life is like here in China, especially in Guangzhou.  If you're interested in seeing what real life is like, what normal life is like, what traveling is like in China, definitely stick around and please subscribe.  What I want to talk to you guys today is the reasons behind the Western brainwashing.  I've made a lot of videos that show Western brainwashing.  You can see the mainstream media, how effective it is at brainwashing Hongkongers, people that live in Taiwan, just anyone who consumes the mainstream media that is owned by only about six companies in the world.  I've made a lot of videos proving that it exists, but I haven't really talked about the motive.  Why try to convince people that China is an evil country when it really isn't?  I'm starting to realize that I think it's actually to keep people like me from getting back in touch with my motherland.  I mean, there's millions of people like me.  I think Western nations realize that if all their millions of Chinese diaspora woke up to the fact that China is actually a really great country, and it's probably way more accepting of them than their new Western countries, that is gonna hurt.  They're just gonna leave, man.  They're just gonna book it.  Get a ticket to China, live in China, be treated with respect, get really good jobs, be able to get promoted with no problem.  Why live in a country that's always going to treat you like a second-class citizen?  So another really important reason is because Chinese university students, they make up the great majority of international students in the world.  They're very capable.  If you look at MIT, if you look at some of the best schools in America, you see these Chinese students there that are doing groundbreaking research.  And if Western countries can capture them and not let them return back to China, if they're able to brainwash them and convert them into hating their motherland.  And that's really great for Western countries because as you know, America, Canada, Australia, they depend on immigration.  Their populations are slowing down.  So they need people to emigrate to their countries.  to keep their economies going.  Chinese immigrants bring money, they bring really great education, they bring a great culture.  They love to say Asians are the model minority and that's because their cultures are really respectful and they know how to follow the rules and respect the law and be positive contributors to their societies.  I mean, if their whole lives they love living in China, how would you be able to steal them away and to keep them in your Western countries so they can start paying taxes, start taking up those jobs that are difficult, take up those technical jobs, those jobs that require high levels of education?  Well, you just brainwash them.  You just tell them that their countries are evil, that their countries are secretly hurting people, secretly torturing people, just make all these accusations.  And because the Chinese media and the Chinese government is a little bit more closed, if you know about Chinese culture, they don't throw their dirty laundry out to air.  That's a Chinese saying, that they don't like to air their dirty laundry in public because... That's just literally the culture.  You know, if you're having a problem with your family, you don't go right outside and start screaming and telling everyone about your problems.  You deal with it in your home.  It's kind of privacy, right?  It's kind of funny because if Westerners respect privacy so much, why do they always demand to know every little detail about everything?  I mean, if you really love privacy, then you really love privacy and you respect that other people have privacy.  If you really love privacy, then you really love privacy and you respect that other people have privacy.  Here's the other thing.  Right now in Canada, America, Australia, there are so many Chinese people that live there.  Like in Canada alone, I think there's like one to two million Chinese people.  That's almost, I don't know, it's like 8% of the population.  And just imagine If all those Chinese people start to wake up to the fact that the media and their governments are always attacking their ancestral country, they're going to freak out.  They're going to rise up.  They're going to protest.  They're going to cause a lot of trouble.  So it's much easier to brainwash people into hating their motherland than dealing with all the fallout that would happen if you decided to start a Cold War with them, which America is doing right now.  America is launching a Cold War on China because it's so scared of China's continued economic rise.  So if you study economics, you already know that China's GDP in PPP terms is already larger than America's.  So that's why right now the U.S.-led media, the U.S.-led Five Eyes Intelligence Alliance, they're doing everything possible to try to make the world hate China, try to make the world start wars with China.  Just anything they can do to throw a wrench into China's machine, they're trying to do that.  Imagine if the millions of Chinese diaspora woke up to the fact that their new homelands are trying to destroy their motherland.  it's not gonna be good for the west.  so look at it from their point of view.  brainwashing those chinese that live in the west.  that is a very effective strategy.  not only does it save money not only does it save time and effort and save them from all the hassles of possible protests.  it's such a brilliant strategy and on top of that you're guaranteed to have these new chinese people that have been brainwashed into loving america over their homeland or into believing all the lies that their motherland is evil.  well now you have people that are willing to fight for you because now you have people that think oh My homeland is evil.  I better take up arms.  I better donate money to all these groups that are gonna support separatism and support trouble.  This brainwashing campaign has so many benefits to Western society.  But the problem is it's all based on lies.  One day people are gonna realize they've been lied to.  for years and years and years just to keep China down and to make sure the Western nations are controlling the world.  And when the truth comes out, there is going to be a massive backlash.  It might be starting now.  When you build a whole campaign on lies, karma is a bitch.  That's something to think about, that This brainwashing campaign, it's not just about communism versus capitalism.  It's not just about the East and the West.  It's actually about making sure that Chinese people that live overseas, that they stay in line, they believe what we want them to believe, and they don't rise up, they don't cause trouble if... our Western countries decide to start a war with China, or start a trade war with China, or start any sort of war, brainwashing ensures that they will shut up.  Not just shut up, but support destruction of their own homeland.  That is the power and the brilliance of a brainwashing campaign.  But again, it's all based on lies, and one day, that house of cards is going to fall, and it's going to be painful.  Alright guys, so that's my vlog for you today.  I hope you enjoyed it.  If this is your first time watching my video, leave me a comment.  And I hope you subscribe.  Take care guys from Guangzhou, China.  Peace and love.  And if you don't brainwash us, well... We might just end up going back to our motherlands like I did.  And I was one of those people that were successfully brainwashed.  I never wanted to go to China.  I never, never, never, never, never, never, never would have imagined living in China.  I'm just a random fool and ended up traveling here while I was in Korea.  That's the only reason I'm here.  And of countries and of customs, I personally... It's loud.  It's so loud in China sometimes.  Sometimes it can be hard to handle.  But as you can see, normally it's okay. ",
