            "text": "Trump voters, nearly four years in, here's an updated list of Trump's 40 biggest broken promises.  Number one, he said the coronavirus would go away without a vaccine.  You bought it.  But he didn't.  While other countries got the pandemic under control and avoided large numbers of fatalities, the virus has killed more than 170,000 Americans.  And that number is still climbing.  Number two, he said he won't have time to play golf if elected president, but he's made more than 250 visits to his golf club since he took office, a record for any president, including more trips during the pandemic than meetings with Dr.  Fauci.  The total financial cost to America, more than $136 million.  Number three, he said he would repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with something beautiful. ",

He's asked the Supreme Court to strike down the law in the middle of a global pandemic with no plan to replace it.  Number four, he said he'd cut your taxes and that the super rich like him would pay more.  He did the opposite.  By 2027, the richest 1% will have received 83% of the Trump tax cut, and the richest 1 tenth of 1%, 60% of it.  But more than half of all Americans will pay more in taxes.  Number five, he said corporations would use their tax cuts to invest in American workers.  They didn't.  Corporations spent more of their tax savings buying back shares of their own stock than increasing workers' wages.  Number six, he said he would boost economic growth by 4% a year.  Nope.  The economy stalled.  Unemployment has soared to the highest level since the Great Depression.  Just over half of working-age Americans are employed, the worst ratio in 70 years. ",

His administration has stripped workers of their rights, repealed overtime protections, rolled back workplace safety rules, and turned a blind eye to employers who steal their workers' wages.  Number nine, he promised that the average American family would see a $4,000 pay raise because of his tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations, but nothing trickled down.  Wages for most Americans have barely kept up with inflation.  Number 10, he promised that anyone who wants a test for COVID will get one.  But countless Americans still can't get a test for COVID.  Number 11, he said hydroxychloroquine protects against coronavirus.  It doesn't.  The FDA revoked its emergency authorization due to the drug's potentially lethal side effects.  Number 12, he promised to eliminate the federal deficit.  He has increased the federal deficit by more than 60%.  Number 13, he said he would hire only the best people.  He has fired a record number of his own cabinet and White House picks, and then called them wackos, dumb as a rock, and not mentally qualified.  Six of them have been charged with crimes.  Number 14, he promised to bring down the price of prescription drugs and said, God, drug industry has been disastrous. ",

Number 16, he promised to help American workers during the pandemic.  But 80% of the tax benefits in the coronavirus stimulus package have gone to millionaires and billionaires.  And at least 21 million Americans have lost extra unemployment benefits, with no new stimulus check to fall back on.  Number 17, he said he drained the swamp.  Instead, he's brought into his administration more billionaires, CEOs, and Wall Street moguls than in any administration in history.  And he's filled departments and agencies with former lobbyists, lawyers, and consultants who are crafting new policies for the same industries they used to work for.

Funny enough, Trump uses his personal cell phone for official business, and several members of his own administration, including Jared Kushner and Ivanka, have used private email in the White House.  Number 22, he promised to use his business experience to whip the federal government into shape.  He hasn't.  His White House is in permanent chaos.  He caused the longest government shutdown in our nation's history when he didn't get funding for his wall.  Number 23, he promised to end DACA.

He hasn't sued them, presumably because he doesn't want the truth to come out.  38.  He promised to bring back all troops from Afghanistan.  He now says, we'll always have somebody there.  Number 39, he pledged to put America first.  Instead, he's deferred to dictators and authoritarians at America's expense and ostracized our allies who now laugh at us behind our back.  Number 40, he promised to be the voice of the common people.  He's made his rich friends richer, increased the political power of big corporations and the wealthy, and harmed working Americans.
