            "text": "Shalom, I'm Messianic Rabbi Zef Porat, and welcome to a special outreach update from Tiberias, Tzvelya, Israel.  We're living in exciting and prophetic times.  There's never been a generation closer to the second coming of Jesus Yeshua than this generation.  We're not setting any dates, but we know that the time is near.  We know that the veil is being lifted.  2 Corinthians 3, verse 16, and Jews are being saved like never before.  there is a revival in israel.  we are in the season of hanukkah the feast of dedication yeshua.  jesus god celebrated the feast of hanukkah dedication.  yeshua is the light of the world and we read in john chapter 10 verse 22 at that time the feast of dedication took place at jerusalem.  it was winter and the feast of dedication in hebrew is the feast of hanukkah.  so we see that yeshua jesus walked into Solomon's colonnade in the Feast of Dedication Hanukkah, and thus the Feast of Dedication Hanukkah is biblical.  As believers in Yeshua and Jesus, we don't celebrate like the rabbis who don't believe in Yeshua.  We celebrate the way Yeshua celebrated it.  He is the light of the world.  Therefore, we need to celebrate the Feast of Hanukkah.  John chapter 13, verse 15.  I have set you an example that you should do as I have done for you.  Yeshua, Jesus, celebrated the Feast of Dedication Hanukkah.  He set the example, and therefore we need to celebrate the Feast of Dedication Hanukkah.  It is biblical.  And how do we celebrate as believers in Yeshua the Feast of Dedication Hanukkah?  By dedicating our life, by Hanukkah-ing our life to Yeshua the Messiah and following him.  He is the light of the world.  He said in Matthew 5, 14, you are the light of the world because that light lives inside of us.  Jews in Israel and around the world, and unfortunately some believers also, use a nine-stick menorah lampstand in Hanukkah, the Feast of Dedication.  This is not biblical.  The Bible says that there is only one lampstand, and that is the seven-lampstand menorah, representing Yeshua, Jesus, the light of the world, the perfect lampstand.  Exodus 25, verse 37.  You shall make seven lamps for it, and the lamp shall be set up as to give light on the space in front of it.  So we can see that the biblical lampstand is the number seven, and it was given to Moses to be a light in the tabernacle.  We can see it's not a nine-stick menorah.  That's not biblical.  It's a seven-lampstand menorah representing Yeshua, Jesus, the light of the world.  And everything in the Old Testament is a shadow of the new.  And if we want to understand the back of the book, we need to understand the front of the book.  Let's turn our Bibles to the book of Revelation, chapter 1, verse 12 and 13, and see that perfect seven lampstand menorah, Yeshua, Jesus.  I turned around to see the voice that was speaking to me.  And when I turned, I saw seven golden lampstands.  Not nine, seven.  That's biblical.  And in the midst of the lampstands, one like the Son of Man, clothed with a long robe and with a golden sash around his chest.  He is the high priest.  So we can see it's a seven menorah lampstand.  And in the middle of the lampstand, one like the Son of Man.  We're using the true lampstand, the true menorah, Yeshua the Messiah, to preach the gospel in this Hanukkah dedication season.  We've been blasting outreaches all through the land of Israel, south to north.  As the team were praying in Tiberias, the Sea of Galilee, the place where Yeshua, Jesus, walked on water, we began sharing the true Hanukkah, the true Feast of Dedication.  I was walking around with a true lampstand in my hand, the number seven.  There was an Orthodox man who noticed that I have a seven-lampstand menorah in my hand.  This attracted him.  He asked me, why are you walking around with a lampstand and a Bible in your hand?  I introduced myself.  He introduced himself as Moshe Ragan.  Moses Ragan.  I said, Chag Sameach, Moshe.  Happy holiday, Moshe.  Happy Hanukkah.  He asked me, why are you walking around with a Bible and a lampstand in your hand?  I asked Moshe, do you light a lampstand, a menorah?  He said, of course I do.  How many sticks does your menorah lampstand have?  He said, nine.  I asked Moshe, can you show me the nine-stick lampstand in the Bible?  Moshe was puzzled by my question and answered, it's not in the Bible.  It's in rabbinic tradition because of the eight days of a miracle that happened.  I told Moshe, yes, there was a big, huge miracle.  But what lampstand, menorah, was in the temple when that miracle happened?  Was it a nine-stick menorah or a seven?  He answered it was a seven.  So I asked him, so why are you using a nine?  I then read Exodus 25, verse 37.  Then you shall make its lamps seven in number, and they shall mount its lamps so high.  as to shed light on the space in front of it.  So we can see that it's a seven lampstand menorah.  I then asked Moshe, what was the purpose of the menorah, the lampstand in the tabernacle?  He said, to give light.  I said, amen, hallelujah.  Is light a blessing?  Moshe said, yes.  I said, would you like the blessing for eight days?  Or would you like the light blessing forever?  Moshe was now staring at the seven lampstand menorah, puzzled.  He then answered, I want the blessing forever.  Praise Yeshua, Jesus.  The Holy Spirit was working on it.  This is why it's so important that we understand the true gospel, that we understand and preach what the Bible says, not what man tradition says.  I told Moshe, we no longer have a temple, no longer have sacrifices.  If you want the light, not just for eight days, but for eternity, it can only be done through the Messiah, HaMashiach.  God, Moshe turned to me, and said, who is this Messiah that can give me the eternal light?  It was time for the full gospel.  I turn the Bible to Psalms chapter 27, verse 1.  The Lord is my light and my salvation.  Whom shall I fear?  The Lord is the stronghold of my life.  Of whom shall I be afraid?  And in Hebrew, it reads like this.  The Lord is my light and my Yeshua.  Whom shall I fear?  Because the word for salvation in Hebrew is Yeshua, Jesus.  So when I read this to Moshe, he was in complete shock.  I told Moshe, only the Lord is light.  Only he is Yeshua.  And only he can give you an eternal blessing, not just for eight days, but forever.  He is that perfect lampstand.  That's why Moses was instructed to put the light, seven lampstand menorah, In the tabernacle, I was representing.  the Lord is my light and my salvation, my Yeshua.  He is the King of kings, the Lord of lords.  He died on the tree on the cross for your sins.  He rose on the third day, and by his blood, if you repent and believe, you have full redemption of sins, eternal life, and not just celebrate the feast of dedication Hanukkah for eight days, but celebrate it forever.  That's why it's eight days, because it points to new beginnings.  Number eight, this Hanukkah is your salvation, your Yeshua.  This Hanukkah is the time for you to dedicate your life and turn to him.  The fact that you and I met today is not a coincidence.  There is no coincidence in the word of God.  This is a divine appointment from God.  You approached me and asked me, why am I walking around with a Bible and a seven lampstand menorah?  And if you want a light, the menorah, the lampstand, for eight days, then light the seven lampstand menorah every day, all of it for eight days, because God is a perfect light.  And that is the true Hanukkah.  Moshe was scratching his head.  This is a lot for me to grasp.  I never thought about the seven lampstand menorah in that way.  It makes sense, but I'm scared.  How can I accept this messiah's when all the rabbis are against him.  I shared my background with Moshe that I was once from a rabbinic family and I too was religious like he was and then set free by the power of the Holy Spirit.  And now I celebrate the light of the world forever.  We exchanged contact information.  We pray that Moshe will contact the ministry, that he'll have visions and dreams and come to know that Yeshua, Jesus is God.  Yeshua is the Messiah, the perfect seven lampstand menorah, the light of the world.  One thing is certain, Moshe and all those that heard the gospel will never be the same again.  And for this, we give all the glory To Yeshua, Jesus.  And for Zion's sake, we will not keep silent.  Isaiah 62, verse 1.  For Zion's sake, I will not keep silent.  For Jerusalem's sake, I will not remain quiet.  Till her vindication shines out like the dawn, her salvation like a blazing torch.  And the word for salvation in Hebrew is Yeshua, Jesus.  Her Yeshua like a blazing torch.  Let's continue to stand together.  as the one new man, Ephesians 2.15.  Work the harvest together, bring the gospel back to Jerusalem, and go home.  Until next time, I'm Messianic Rabbi Zev Porah, sending you blessings from Israel in the mighty name of the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, Jesus Yeshua.  Amen.  Every knee shall bow.  and every tongue will confess that Yeshua, Jesus, is Lord.  Hallelujah.  Amen. ",
