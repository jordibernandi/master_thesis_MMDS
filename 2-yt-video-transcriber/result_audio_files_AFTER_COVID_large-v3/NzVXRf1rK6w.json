            "text": "Most people deep down don't realize that their whole life they've been programming their minds to be a loser and to hear negative things and to allow negative things and to do self-talk negatively.  and then you set goals and we're educated to set big goals and then you don't reach them.  and all of a sudden it's like what does your subconscious really believe about you fucking loser?  you've never hit a goal.  you procrastinate every day.  you lie to yourself.  you say you're going to start a diet.  you don't.  you say you're going to make more money.  you don't.  you say you're going to be more faithful.  you're not.  You're just basically a piece of shit, but you are not aware of that because it's in your sub conscious, which means below awareness.  You're not even aware that you don't like yourself.  So you make decisions and actions based on that.  And that's why you're not succeeding and you can't break through that glass ceiling and you're just not in a position to win and you'll never be.  because you're more worried about the outside rather than the inside.  So how do you fix the inside?  Well, let's break it backwards.  How did you fuck it up?  Well, you fucked it up by sitting there listening to all this negativity your whole life, picturing yourself losing your whole life.  So you have to reverse that dude.  Your mind is a, is a series of mental images.  You have to get those mental images, pictures and stories and smells and sounds out of your subconscious mind.  How?  You can't hit delete.  Doesn't work that way.  There's only one way.  You replace them.  You replace those images and beliefs in your subconscious.  How?  Here's how.  Got your pen handy?  Here's how.  Number one, just like anytime you're sorry and you want a new chance with somebody, what's the first thing you would do if you screwed up on your girl, Mike, and you wanted her to give you another chance?  Apologize.  That's right.  You apologize, but you apologize to yourself.  Sounds stupid, like, you know, stupid.  Okay, well.  Forgive yourself, yeah.  Forgive yourself, man.  Everybody deserves a second chance.  Don't believe what you've been told your whole life.  Get rid of it.  Forgive yourself.  Get your slate clean.  Number two, make a commitment.  Now, that's a big word, commitment.  Commitment means always do what you say you're gonna do from that point forward.  Always do what you say you're gonna do.  You get to decide what you're gonna do and you take that responsibility because a lot of people blame other people and they look for other people to blame when in reality, dude, look at yourself.  But at the end of the day, you make a commitment which means you're always going to do what you say you're going to do moving forward.  And then you'd be very careful with what you agree to.  And because, because from this day forward, you will always do what you say you're going to do.  Like period.  You say you're going to work out.  You get off work late.  You're tired.  Who gives a fuck?  Get your ass in there.  Get your fucking fat ass and do what you said you're going to do.  Always do what you say you're going to do, which is why I warn people.  Just quit agreeing so easily.  Be more selective what you agree to.  You forgive yourself.  Then you commit to always do what you say you're going to do.  And then step three, guess what?  you set some small attainable goals.  when you're trying to repair and replace the images in your head of you losing and failing and not hitting your goals you want to place some goals that you can hit.  so you make 10 easy goals every single day which are a little bit better than yesterday.  do what you say you're going to do.  set 10 small goals every day right so you get used to winning Because at the end of the day, man, memory of winning is what confidence is.  So you set these 10 small goals a day and you achieve them every single day like clockwork.  Your brain starts to say, win, win, win.  The mind doesn't know the difference between a big win and a small win.  It just knows you're winning.  You win.  That's what you do.  You set your mind to something and it happens.  You keep your word.  You're a fucking good dude.  And all of a sudden, you start to set up a little taller for some reason.  Quit making excuses.  This is how you do it.  If you want to fucking win, write these down.  Do them.  And STFU.  Like, this is it. ",
