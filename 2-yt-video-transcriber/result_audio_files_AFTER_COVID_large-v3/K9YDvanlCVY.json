We think that that's talking about all of Christians who have been married to Jesus Christ.  They're not Christians.  They are tribulation saints.  When you look at the text, it's talking about those who were martyred because they did not receive the mark of the beast or worship the beast, worship Satan.  And so the fact is that they have been killed, but they will resurrect.  Then they will go into the kingdom.  But there will be some that live.  THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SUSTAIN LIFE DURING THAT SEVEN-YEAR PERIOD OF TIME.  AND THEY ALSO WILL GO INTO THE KINGDOM.  THEY'RE GOING TO LIVE FOR A THOUSAND YEARS AND ACTUALLY THEY'LL LIVE FOREVER.  THAT'S A VERY INTERESTING DEVELOPMENT IN THE WORD OF GOD.  YEAH. ",

Will they be able to bear children? ",

            "text": "Absolutely.  In fact, we've got to figure out how they're going to stay alive, because they will never receive a resurrected, glorified body.  They are living when they come out of the tribulation and go into the kingdom.  The Bible tells us in the book of Revelation, chapter 2 and verse 7, it's the letter to the church at Ephesus, that those who are overcomers, those who have been born again, they will eat of the tree of life.  And that gives them the capability to live forever, not only in the kingdom period, but into eternity future as well.  Remember over in Genesis.  And here we go back and forth between the book of Revelation and the Old Testament.  In the book of Genesis, chapter 3, Jesus said, hey, don't let Adam and Eve get back into that garden, because if they eat of the tree of life, they will live forever.  So they will go into the kingdom period, Isaiah 65 20 says they will have children if they would like to do that.  They will reproduce.  They will have children.  A child will be able to live to be 100 years of age.  And during that time they have the responsibility of either accepting Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior or rejecting Him.  Now, if they reject Jesus Christ, and this is going to be a perfect world during the kingdom period, why would they?  I can almost say the same thing about people today.  Why do they not, when they understand the truth, receive Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior?  But if they reject Jesus Christ at the end of that hundred-year period of time, they will be sent to Hades, there to be kept until the great white throne judgment. ",
