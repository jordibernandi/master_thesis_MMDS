You're dating yourself, saying things like austerity, all those old-fashioned ideas like spending less than you collect in revenue and then just printing the rest.  Come on, it's different this time.  And I'd also like to point out, you mentioned there a key topic, negative interest rates, but... While Trump is hailing negative interest rates and the Fed seems like, well, they're going to pretend they don't want to agree on it, but they both want the same thing.  Yet if the 10-year bond is 0.6% and the Fed has a 2% inflation mandate, aren't interest rates already negative? ",

And so, yeah, I think, well, there is no thank you.  It is absolutely, we are absolutely already negative.  But nonetheless, we are going to head to actual negative and on top of money creation and printing will be exceedingly negative.  The bottom line is that the concept of pushing on a string comes to mind in the respect that they are forcing people into speculation.  They are killing savers and they want people to get out there and spend and to invest and to speculate.  And when you talk about negative interest rates and at the same time, the possibility leading into the fall of perhaps the stock market running into trouble and what I would consider to be a big concern would be that what the Fed and the this money with a keystroke, it has the potential through inflation to turn the bond market over heading into the end of the year.  And you look at the possibility of a stock market and a bond market falling at the same time, coupled with perhaps a second wave heading into the cold and flu season of COVID.  And you have an environment where there are very few places to safely put your money on the planet.  If stocks and bonds are both turning over at the same time and the economy is in shambles, other than precious metals, I don't know where you put your money.  Chris, I've always tried to maintain objectivity.  It doesn't do a businessman or woman any good to be subjective as it pertains to their own wares because you see through that very quickly, at least I think so.  And trying to be objective and play devil's advocate, uh, for what you're doing in any business environment, I think is good.  It's a good practice.  And I look around me and think of where I would put my money in this environment.  If I came into a large distribution of money, a large inheritance or whatever it may be.  And I struggle to find any place other than gold and silver in this environment where I would feel comfortable.  And so- If nothing else, Chris, as the Chinese curse goes, may you live in interesting times.  We are entering into what may be, at least from a standpoint of economics, the most interesting time in human history. ",

We're seeing articles about whether Trump should repay China.  So whether the U.S.  government likes you now is apparently a least in the discussion as a criteria.

You're seeing it, too, where people are coming in for the first time because the Fed, you politely called them a magician, but, I mean, they've been flat-out lying for decades, and now the lies are just so silly.

The difficult part, Chris, is that the mainstream would have you believe that we're all wearing tinfoil hats and we're just paranoid and conspiratorial.  But the reality of it is in my market, all of the easy money that has been created since 2008 has been holed up in financial assets.  And for the first time in 30 years, I'm getting phone calls every single day with people who never ever called before who've never owned gold.  And for the first time we're concerned and or afraid, really afraid.  And you're right.  Normally they would stop in the bond market.  That would be the logical place to go.  It used to be risk on risk off stocks, risk on bonds, risk off in the nineties.  You could buy treasuries yielding 9% where a $2 million investment nets you 180 grand.  You never touch your principal.  your children get that and you live like Kings and Queens.  But, you know, as you're mentioning that the 10 year at six tenths of a percent in the 30 year at just over one and a half or what have you, these are numbers that do not allow people to, to save and or to invest in fixed income with any modicum or reasonable modicum of, of return to match standard of living.  And so you're forced into, into a great deal of, of, of speculation and, And I think that unconventional times like this call for unconventional thought, I think that your gut is your best financial advisor.  I think that most financial advisories right now would scoff at the idea of going heavy into precious metals.  But when we talk about a risk reward scenario, you know, when you look at previous market collapses.  They all follow a similar pattern of a major drop, some time lag in between, which coincides with an increase in the value of the indices, which come with a bit more optimism.  And then it resumes its fall later on in the cycle.  And I think we are in the dead cat bounce phase right now.  I think that my business has, which was At all-time highs, 10x in March is half of that right now.  It's still insane, but not what it was in March.  And coinciding with the dead cat bounce in the equity market and the reopening of the economies.  Chris, if I were going to be completely honest on two levels, number one, I still am every bit as concerned about the future viability of the precious metals industry and getting products.  And I say that to you with 100% sincerity.  I'm concerned that if we see any resumption or an uptick in COVID cases due to cold and flu season and the second wave, as people talked about, I'm afraid that that'll be the death knell for this industry.  You have two mints in North America and the rest of them are across the Atlantic.  You have a supply chain that is fractured.  at very best, is held together with bubble gum and scotch tape.  And I'm concerned about it.  And I look at this as maybe the last train out.  And if I'm wrong, things go back to normal.  And you own some gold and silver that you paid 4% or 5% higher than you normally do.  But if I'm right, I don't care how much money people have, you'll get nothing in the way of product with any sort of expedient delivery.  So look, bottom line is simply this.  The numbers are scary.  The Fed and the Treasury have created several trillion dollars in the period of a month or so.  It took 300 years to make $800 billion in this country.  And so we're heading down a path where we're heading down a scary path.  And you're right.  Valuations and fair value is something that is becoming harder and harder to determine.  So for me, In all of this uncertainty and chaos, I have a great deal of safety and comfort in precious metals.  So I don't know where people can safely put their money with comfort.  For me, Chris, it lies in precious metals.  And I think in terms of where we're going, I don't think we've seen anything yet.  I look for gold to be well north of 2000 by the end of this year.  And silver has a lot of catching up to do.  I look at silver as the most undervalued commodity on the planet.  and probably the best investment on the planet.  And so I'm very optimistic as to the prices of gold and silver, but not so optimistic as to the availability of it going forward.  So this is a unique time, a really unique kind of quiet before the storm, if you will. ",

Hey, last one before we wrap up, just if you could maybe to give people an idea of where it stands in terms of, I mean, we could look at Silver Eagle Premium, maybe Gold Eagle Premium as well, but just to put it in perspective, if you could say, all right, the premiums about what they were, January, February, before people had heard of Corona.  I know they've spiked since then.  Have they come back in at all?  What range are people looking at?  Maybe if you could give a timeline of those premiums. ",

            "text": "Sure.  And it's also important to understand for your listeners out there that the delineation between the terms premium and commission.  The dealers like myself and SD and JM and Atmax, we all make a commission.  That commission is on top of the premium.  The premium is a function of supply and demand.  What the mints are pumping out, what the distributors, the primary distributors have in stock, what we have to pay the secondary market to buy product from people.  So the bottom line is simply this.  Do understand that with these majorly escalating premiums, it does not mean that dealers are making any more money than they normally do.  And I'd really like that to be understood.  it's very important that for me to go out and buy silver Eagles right now and sell them at $7 or seven and a quarter over spot, which would be the cheapest in America or amongst, and they were $10 over spot in March.  So they've come off considerably, but at seven or seven and a quarter, you're still, you know, in, in December, they were two 89.  So you're still way higher than they've, they've been in, in a very, very long time.  save for the month of February and March.  But here again, this is the lull before the storm.  The United States Mint has owed us over 25,000 Silver Eagles better part of five weeks, and we've gotten maybe a third of them.  So their allocations are sparse at best.  The premiums have come down a little bit because some of the other mints have caught up and bridged the gap.  Canadian Mint has caught up, so to speak.  The purse mint has filled a big void.  And so there is other product in there as the market or the demand over the last two, three weeks has waned a little bit.  But it wouldn't take but another event of any sort.  Don't forget, we are always talking about the repo market leading up before the COVID.  Any event that increases demand again will render higher premiums and major delivery delays.  So here again, we're off.  from where we were on the highs, but still majorly inflated from where we were a few months ago with, in my opinion, no clarity on things getting better on the supply chain.  So little better than before, a lot higher than what is normal.  And quite frankly, I don't see a major trend of it going one way or the other.  It's kind of just hanging out right now.  Silver eagles in the seven plus range, maple leaves, kangaroos in the five, five and a half range.  Gold Eagles have come down from 10, 10.5% to roughly 8.75%.  Normally, Gold Eagles would be 4% to 5%.  So they're not tremendously higher than they normally were in gold, but still markedly higher than normal.  So, you know, interesting lull, if you will, Chris, that I guess the short-term trend is of them coming back.  little bit, but I'm not optimistic that we don't see a resumption of difficulty getting products.  So whatever, I just think right now is a good time to add if you're thinking of doing it.  But right now, product is decent.  Availability is decent.  Shipping time is decent.  The premiums are only down just a little bit from where they were in March. ",
