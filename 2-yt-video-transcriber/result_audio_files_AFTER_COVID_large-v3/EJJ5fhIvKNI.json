            "text": "How's it going?  Hello.  How you doing?  Not too bad.  What's going on?  Nothing.  Just taking some video.  Video in the area?  Yeah.  recording taking pictures.  for uh you guys did you talk to anybody in the building wise to get it cleared or not?  in the building a guy came out with a darker green outfit than you and said us army.  i didn't see a name on it though so i don't know if he's like a recruit or something but he was asking me questions and i just told him i'm recording and you know not not up to no good i'm just Just recording.  I'm not planning anything.  I'm not a bad guy, you know?  No worries.  We just got to make sure because, you know.  Yeah, yeah.  Definitely you should ask, you know, because.  Do you got a name or a card or anything?  I don't.  We were talking about printing cards and stuff, but I don't have any yet.  Can I ask your name?  You can ask.  What's your name?  I don't want to give my name because, you know, in this day and age with identity theft and, you know, people making false claims when they call 911 and freak out, snowflakes and all that stuff, you know, and then the cops come and they get your name and you end up getting a ticket in the mail or something stupid.  Sure.  No offense right now.  No, no, I have to check security protocol, but... You know, it might be good just to let somebody know if you're going to do something like that because with security the way it is, we just want to make sure there's nothing abnormal about it.  Yeah, I've seen instances where, you know, you don't even want to go on the property.  So that's why I haven't gone on.  I know this sidewalk is on your property or the Armory property, and this sidewalk is on public right-of-way.  So I don't even want to go on the entrance to talk to anybody.  And then you're taking photos of the motor pool over here?  Yeah, yeah.  That's the most interesting part is all the tanks and everything, you know.  So, I got the sign on the front.  That's pretty cool to have, you know.  And then that sign with the flag behind it.  No worries.  All right, just check to see what's going on.  Yeah, no problem.  Thanks for asking.  Hey, buddy, you're kind of blocking the road.  How's it going, sir?  I'm going fine.  Do you have your ID on you?  No.  You got yours?  I do.  Can you tell me your name and badge number?  It's right here on my vest.  And?  What's your name, sir?  Oh, there's two of you.  Yes, what's your name, sir?  What's your first name?  What's your name?  What is your name and date of birth, sir?  I'm sorry, I'm not going to give that information at this time.  So you're failing to identify yourself?  You realize that's obstructing your identification?  No, it's not.  Yes, it is, sir.  This guy comes up, he's blocking the road, and he's saying, I need your name.  I need your name.  He said, that's obstruction.  Sir, I'm Sergeant Olsen.  Can you speak to me?  So what's going on today, sir?  For the record, can I have your name and badge number?  Sergeant Olsen, star 241 of the press room.  Can I have 10 feet?  Sir, he does not have to stand there.  He can stand where he likes, sir.  Really?  Yes, sir.  If you don't want, would you like to speak with us today?  I can talk to you a little bit, but I don't want him behind me.  Sir, well, that's for my safety and my partner's safety, sir.  No, sir.  Yes, it is.  Well, for my safety, I want you both in my field of view.  Well, sir, if you want to speak with us, you can speak with us.  If you don't, if you don't.  All right.  Then I guess I don't want to talk to you.  if he's going to stand right there.  Well, he is going to stand right there, sir.  I don't know you.  You don't know me.  All right, so did I get your name, badge number, 241, Olson?  Would you like it again?  No, that's good.  Thank you, but he didn't say his.  He didn't give me his.  All right, thank you very much.  I'm trying to.  Would you like to speak to me?  Are we trying to cause a confrontation?  No way.  No way.  Well, I see you have an American flag hat on, correct?  Yeah.  Okay, so can I ask you what's going on today?  We're just trying to get to the bottom of what's happening.  Well, I got three cameras, so I'll give you three guesses.  I'm not going to play this custody.  I'm sorry.  I'm not.  Right now, I have way too much to do.  Okay.  And I'm way too busy to sit here and argue and go back and forth with you and play a custody.  All right.  I'll make it short and simple, Sergeant.  All I'm doing is recording and taking video, pictures.  That's it.  They got tanks out here.  You can see all this from the highway.  Okay.  You know.  Okay.  I never went on their property.  I made sure I stayed off.  I was on the road.  I was on the sidewalk.  I'm just recording.  That's it.  We got called here.  We have a job to do.  So we came out.  We came to speak to you.  Obviously, you're recording whatever you're recording.  You may have people on edge considering that this is a government building here.  But what we were told, we're building people coming in now.  Just so you're aware.  That's all that it comes down to.  All right.  Let me address that.  First of all, Number one, they came out.  One guy came out.  He said, did you go in and get permission?  I said, no, I'm not going on the property, so I can't go in there and get permission.  But he was very nice.  He never said, hey, I'm calling the cops or anything like that.  We had a nice conversation, and he went back inside.  So I don't know what the big deal is.  And second of all, look at this place.  It's like Fort Knox.  They got tanks.  They got a big cannon over there.  I'm sure they got tons of guns in there.  So what could I do with my little cameras?  to hurt them.  Sir, I'm not sure exactly where you're going with it or not going with it.  All I'm telling you is we got called here and obviously we're disturbed that you're out here videoing Army and National Guard walking into the building in uniform.  You do have an American flag hat on and almost a military style hat on.  So they were just wondering.  It's almost camel, so maybe that's what I should buy.  Fishing hat.  Okay.  Well, is it like a baseball cap?  Yeah, it's a baseball cap.  It's got, like, fish scales on it.  Okay, so I'm not here to argue with you.  I love this hat.  I see that you're a little argumentative, and that's the way you want to be.  That's fine.  This guy, he came rolling up and demanded my ID.  That's a pretty nice application, sir.  That's it.  No, you didn't ask.  I have it on video.  You didn't ask me.  You demanded it.  Sir, have a nice day.  Thank you.  Stay safe.  I hope you realize the area right now where you're in and stuff like that.  I know.  I would just be careful.  I know.  I know.  Standing out here videotaping, especially videotaping cars and stuff going by, may not be the safest choice.  Okay?  All right.  So, sir, have a great day.  Thank you.  Okay, you are.  You guys have a good day and be safe.  Sorry, sir.  Are you still recording?  What's that?  I just wanted to advise you, at this point forward, You're told by, we've already confirmed with them, that if you step foot on their property at all in any way, so this property or that property, they will have you arrested for trespass.  Okay.  I just want to let you, so we're all on the same page.  Yeah, that's fine.  Okay, so have a good day.  Just for today or any day?  They do not want you back there on this property at all. ",

All right.  I'm just telling you so I don't want to see anybody get jammed up.  God bless, sir.  Have a blessed day.  Thank you.  Isn't that cool?  The Army doesn't want me.  Car number 601.
