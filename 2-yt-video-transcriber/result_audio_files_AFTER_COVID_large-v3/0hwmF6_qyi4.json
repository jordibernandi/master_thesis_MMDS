            "text": "Well, hi everyone and greetings from northern Michigan.  This is Bob the Science Guy and welcome to my neck of the woods.  You know, when I first got into the flat earth community, I was a reasonably intelligent, scientifically literate man who was faced with 10 or 12 very well polished yet nonsensical arguments supporting the flat earth.  Now, sometimes we run into a little problem.  We all know that the Earth is rotating, but how do you exactly scientifically prove that?  I knew about sunrise and sunset, but I learned about Foucault pendulums, and I learned about mechanical gyroscopes, the pattern of shadows, centrifugal force and weight differentials, etc.  It was a really nice journey learning all of these things, but I got to thinking, wouldn't it be nice if we had one series out there that took apart each of these standard flat earth arguments, and gave us a basis for our response.  So what I did was I put together a rather exciting panel.  Let me introduce them to you.  Well, first let me introduce you to Charlie H. He's not very well known, but he brings with him a wealth of experience to this series.  He is a physics major who builds telescopes, both for the professionals and for amateurs.  Projects that he's worked on include the Giant Magellan Telescope down in Chile.  The interesting thing about Charlie is that he lived and worked in Antarctica for well over a year, both at the McMurdo Station and at the South Pole, doing solar observations.  So he's going to talk a little bit about that.  Next we have Harry from Tennessee.  He's an electrical engineer and you know him as Blue Marble Science.  He's got a very nice way of explaining things in simple terms that really make a lot of sense and he's somebody I've worked with on a number of different experiments.  Now we're going to be joined by one more expert later on in the series and I'll introduce him when he comes in.  And finally, we have Rob, a commercial pilot, amateur astronomer, and all-around polymath.  He was the inspiration for my channel and the style and content that you see on this channel.  So let's cue up the music and get started with our friend Wolfie6020. ",

One was Sir Sick.  who just kind of introduced me to the idea that people actually believed in Flat Earth.  And then the other one, of course, was you.  You were one of my early inspirations and one of my early backers.  You got me my first hundred subs with a little shout out on your channel.  Now here we are 400 videos later and almost 20,000.  But it started with you, man.  The very first subject that I did a video on was pilots having to dip their nose.  And I'm a pilot.  I don't have to dip my nose, and I know why.  So I made a quick 10-minute video with my iPhone on the dining room table.  Well, here you go.  Here's my expertise.  But I'm glad I got that settled for you.  Then the fight began.  In the Flat Earth, there really aren't any original arguments.  And one of the things that I wanted to do was kind of go over their top 10 list and show how to properly counter them.  There are a lot of very scientifically literate and smart people out there that never really gave any thought to, well, what is the proof?  the Earth rotates?  And why did they phrase that question in that certain way?  You know, why do they say gas pressure and not atmospheric pressure?  So let's go over a few of them.  The first one is one of my personal favorites.  Gravity is not a force.  What are your thoughts on that, Wolfie? ",

            "text": "Well, my standard argument with the flat earthers when they talk about gravity is just keeping it as simple as possible.  They tend to overcomplicate it, but there's one thing that we cannot deny, and that is if we jump, we fall back down.  If we throw an object into the air, it falls back down.  OK, something is causing it to do that.  And if they want to call it gravity or something else, it doesn't really matter because we cannot refute the fact that objects will fall towards the ground.  It's irrefutable.  You can throw water in the air.  You can throw a ball.  It's just going to fall down.  So there is something there that is pulling things down towards the ground.  That aspect is irrefutable.  precise about what it actually is doesn't really matter for most of the arguments on that case.  You know, when we start to look at atmospheric pressure later on in the discussion, it doesn't matter what is causing those air molecules to be pulled toward the surface.  But we can irrefutably prove that something is doing that.  So I sort of don't get tied up in their word games.  You know, I try to keep it as very simple as possible and When a flat earther starts telling me to prove gravity, I'll throw straight back at them.  I said, tell me what happens when you jump up or tell me what happens when you throw a ball in the air.  And then we take it from there because they cannot refute the fact that it falls back down to the ground. ",

Even as far as Einstein is concerned, gravity does manifest itself as a force once an object is no longer allowed to move along its preferred geodesic.  So if you're not falling through the air and are in contact with the earth, even according to Einstein, I believe that you would be essentially experiencing a force between you and the ground.  So as far as normal people's use of the term they experience a force, because when they get on a scale, they weigh something.  When they pick something up, it weighs something.  When they hang a fish on a spring scale, there is a weight there, and all of those weights are forces.  Now, from the point of view of physics, of course, a force is something that happens when you try to accelerate a mass.  But to say that gravity is not a force, that's just an attempt to deflect. ",

It does present itself as a force in three-dimensional space.  Frankly, you know, when we're dealing with gravity here on Earth, I really rather think of it as an acceleration rather than a force.  Acceleration gives rise to a force if it's being applied to a mass, obviously.  But at the end of the day, you go over to the work of Einstein, And now you're in four dimensions, and now spacetime is curving, and you do have an acceleration present.  But I think the main thing to keep in mind is, regardless of which one you're talking about, they both end up saying the same thing.  What do you mean by that?  Well, as long as mass... As long as the mass we're talking about is relatively small, I mean something quite a bit smaller than, say, a black hole, and as long as things aren't moving too quickly, like close to the speed of light, you reach the weak field limits of the Einstein field equations.  And what happens is Newton's equation falls right out of it.  They say exactly the same thing, and you will get exactly the same answer.

Now, Sleeping Warrior and Quantum Eraser and these other flat Earth scholars, I guess you'd call them, think out their arguments in advance, and they do it to promote their narrative.  Now, their narrative is the Earth is flat.  If gravity exists... Any large object will collapse into a sphere due to gravitational forces.  There's no way around it.  A disk or a large flat plane cannot exist.  It would collapse into a sphere.  So what they do is they sit down and say, well, Einstein quote-unquote superseded Newton.  Now, superseded means replaced or invalidated in their mind.  So therefore, we can no longer look at Newton.  And since Einstein's gravity is based on math, and math, of course, as we know, isn't real, therefore, Einstein's gravity is invalid.  So Newton's been invalidated.  Given the fact that Einstein's just math, that's not valid.  Therefore, no gravity.  Does that pretty much sum it up? ",

One of the big distinctions seems to be the difference between Newtonian gravity and Einsteinian gravity.  Let me see if I can clear that up with a little analogy.  Say you're driving down the road minding your own business.  Your speed is steady.  You're staying in your lane.  Things are good with the world.  Up ahead, you see a group of deer grazing in the shoulder off to the side of the road.  What do you do?  Well, this is a pretty common experience that we have here in Michigan, and what we do is we kind of move over to the opposite lane to give them a little bit of space in case they decide to do something stupid, and we don't really want to startle them too much, but it isn't anything that's going to interfere with our trip down the road.  Now, when we pass the deer, we go back into our original lane.  If you look at this situation from a Newtonian aspect, the deer caused us to go to the other lane.  And there's a lot of argument for that.  We can be perfectly happy understanding it in that way.  And then once we were past the deer, we went back into our original lane.  Now with Einstein, the presence of the deer caused us to move into the other lane.  You see the slight distinction?  Now in reality, we control the vehicle and we moved over into the other lane because the deer were there.  They didn't do anything to physically move us.  But even looking at it both ways, the end result was the same.  We were in our lane, we moved to the opposite lane, we returned to our lane when we passed the deer.  The effect is no different either way.  Now in our next episode, we're going to discuss the term level, and water finds its level.  So I hope you'll hit that little like and subscribe button down there, and join me for the rest of this series, which will go on for several weeks.  In the meantime, this is Bob the Science Guy, signing out from Northern Michigan.  Thank you very much for stopping by, and take care.  See you soon. ",
