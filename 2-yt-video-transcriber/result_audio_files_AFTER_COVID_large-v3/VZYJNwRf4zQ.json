If I'm 100% honest, I can't say that I agree with a lot of what the McCloskeys shared.  I do wonder whether there's a different way for them to see the world and be in the world.  But I appreciated them being here.  I appreciated them sharing what they thought.  Hope you'll continue to enjoy this show.  If you do, remember you can subscribe.  You also can listen to the podcast.  It's often got an extended version of the conversation.  And if you're finding something valuable here, think about telling your friends.  Thanks for joining me.  I'll see you soon. ",
