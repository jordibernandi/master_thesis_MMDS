One measure was already approved by the House, but a second measure is an economic stimulus plan that could be worth about $850 billion.

It's going to be very difficult to identify all the small businesses that are essentially getting crushed right now, don't have access to credit usually, even under the best of circumstances.  I was talking to a business owner yesterday who said that they just make payroll in normal times, And that this setback is going to mean that they're digging out forever.  They might not ever, ever reopen their doors again.  And that's going to be playing out in small businesses around the country.  They're the hardest to identify.  We have to be very, very aggressive in trying to put resources into their hands.  But this is not going to be business as usual after the crisis for many small businesses.
