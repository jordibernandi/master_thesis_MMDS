            "text": "I just wanted to jump on here and check all my Facebook peeps after the bad news we just got that President Trump got Corona 19 and I just keep thinking.  I just keep thinking how could a man so strong catch something so fake?  and I guess they gave him the test and he peed on it and it came back positive.  I'm surprised he even announced it.  Usually he downplays something like this for two to three months.  Bogey, be quiet.  I'm in mourning.  And people keep asking, what about Joe Biden?  What about Joe?  He was in the same room too.  I bet that's who gave it to him.  You know, the Democrats, they knew they couldn't win, so they sacrificed Joe.  And I bought a 4K TV with my Donnie dollars that he sent me, and you could see it.  Joe Biden said, why don't you shut up, man?  And the spittle just flew across the stage.  It landed on his men's warehouse sleeve, and I kept playing it back, back and to the left, back and to the left, and... I didn't think it was real.  You weren't supposed to be the one to get it, Mr.  President.  You were supposed to be the one to destroy it.  You shouldn't have caught it.  It shouldn't have been you.  It should have been me.  I just can't wait to downplay all my anti-mask rhetoric so I can yell at you people for making jokes.  I don't know who this karma lady is you keep talking about, but she's not a bitch.  You're a bitch for making jokes about this man.  Leave him alone.  He is sick.  Leave this man.  Leave this man. ",
