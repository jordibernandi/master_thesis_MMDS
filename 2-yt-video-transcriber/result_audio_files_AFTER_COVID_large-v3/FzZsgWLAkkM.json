            "text": "Ladies and gentlemen, you know, this is a story I am really happy to tell you about.  This comes out of Georgia, ladies and gentlemen, and this came from Board Panda.  September 1st, 2020, 19 Black families decided to build their own safe city, purchased 97 acres of land in Georgia, and they're going to build and live on the land, 19 families.  That means each one of these families get a nice piece of land, 97 acres of land.  Each family will have a nice big chunk of land, which is nice.  This is really a good idea.  As long as you can vet the people and know they are the kind that's going to be helpful and help building and give their all to getting that land together.  You know what I mean?  You definitely don't want to get some of these nut jobs.  That talk like they're all about the black community.  But then again, you know, they'll turn around and stab another black person in the back.  You don't want those kind of people out there.  But anybody that's ready and willing to purchase and build on that land with you, I think it's a great idea.  So in the middle of the protest of police brutality and a pandemic, 19 Black families have joined forces and purchased 96.71 acres of land in Tombsboro, Georgia.  They plan to build a new safe city there.  Good for them.  Good for them.  And I hope they pull it off, too.  Ashley Scott, a Georgia-based realtor, started the Freedom Georgia Initiative with a few like-minded people in an op-ed for... Okay, so Scott explains that the idea came after the death of Ahmaud Arbery, a Black man that was killed by a group of white men while out jogging.  Mm-hmm.  I was concerned at times, distraught for the first time ever in my life.  I felt disempowered.  So much that the overachieving, solution-oriented, practical, non-emotional person that I am had to stop, Scott wrote.  I sought counseling from a black therapist and it helped.  It helped me realize that what we as black people are suffering from is racial trauma.  We are dealing with a systematic racism.  We are dealing with deep rooted issues that will require more than protesting in the streets.  It will take for us as a people as Atlanta rapper and activist Killer Mike so eloquently put, to plot, plan, strategize, organize, and mobilize.  So that's what I and my good friend Renee Walters, an entrepreneur and investor, did.  That's a great idea.  You know, they need to make that private property And when they get it done, fence that whole area and make it a gated community and make it private.  You know, there are many out there.  Together, they began to look for ways to change the world for the better in whatever way they could.  We wanted to make some kind of difference that could ensure the safety of our Black sons and husbands.  When they went out about their, you know, with their lives, you know, it is.  it is very nerve wracking in this society because that's true.  Black men and black boys are always the main target.  You don't have to do anything wrong in America to end up in jail.  See, these folks always want you to believe, oh, well, you had to do something.  No, you don't have to do nothing in America.  to end up in jail.  Just like you don't have to do nothing in America for Karen to walk up to you and start some mess.  You don't have to do anything wrong.  You could be just walking and minding your business and some suspicious person, she's calling the cop, some suspicious person is walking down the street.  That's all it takes.  No crime has to be committed.  And when we see these Karen videos, I have yet to see one crime.  I have yet to see one.  OK.  All right.  So we wanted to do something to amass black power to affect real change.  Well, this certainly will.  Shoot, having your own land and doing whatever you want on that land.  No, that'll empower you for sure.  We consider the reality that even in Atlanta, with an exceptional Black woman like Mayor Keisha Lance Bottom, yeah, whatever, there was no respect for the humanity of Blacks, Scott continued.  Even with Erica Shields, A Black woman chief of police at the helm.  There was the murder of Rashard Brooks.  No, I can tell you right there, having a Black chief of police doesn't change anything as far as what happens to us out on the streets.  It doesn't change anything.  It never have, it never will.  We can see there is something much deeper happening.  Politics, as usual, isn't the answer.  Right.  Politics, unfortunately, don't go far enough.  And the things that the Black community needs, it doesn't.  I mean, we can vote all day and all night, but if there are not policies in place to help us, There's nothing that's going to change for us as far as our daily life is concerned.  And we know just from history, when these politicians get in office, they suddenly don't know who we are.  Okay.  The group joined several Facebook groups discussing building Black cities and new Black Wall Streets.  And it turned out there were more people who shared the same desires.  Yeah, there are.  And there's really more beyond the 19 families.  It was clear to me that developing new cities was necessary because these old ones, even with strong Black leadership, have too many deep-rooted problems.  Yeah, she's right about that.  As a realtor, Scott had been sitting on zoning and city council meetings.  At first, I attended wanting to get a few new clients, but seeing the progress of the newly created city of Stonecrest, Georgia inspired me.  It motivated Scott to look more deep into local politics and how cities are created.  My research into cityhood gave me insight that this is how we change the communities and build real black power.  Black power comes from wealth, Scott explained.  Wealth is created through cashflow and assets.  Who has more cash flow and assets than governments?  Where does the cash flow come from?  Taxes and bonds.  Who pays taxes?  Landowners.  Who run governments?  People.  We are the people.  We have to be more involved, especially young people.  Scott said she knows people might start wondering what in the world does all that have to do with?  why y'all purchase all that land in the midst of protest and a pandemic and how you use cooperative economics to do it.  According to her, everything.  The land don't look bad.  You know, it's just, you know, it's got an overgrowth and everything.  But a lot of land in this country started out that way until people started, you know, building on it.  OK, we figure we could try to fix a broken system or we could start fresh.  Start a city that could be a shining example of being the change you want to see.  We want it to be more involved in creating our lives.  We really want for our black families.  And maybe, just maybe, some generational wealth for our, yeah, for your children, of course.  That certainly will create it.  You know, land is everything because you can do so much on that land.  And without it, you know, you're really nothing without land.  So I like what these folks are doing.  I like what they're doing.  And they plan on building a green community, an eco-friendly community, you know, even in their building materials.  I respect that.  That is very smart.  You know, it's good to see a story like this.  And you never know, maybe many more Black people can group together and can follow this example.  You never know.  But at least they're trying.  I can give them that.  At least they are trying to do something about their situation.  And it is.  It's a bad situation for Black people in America.  It has been for a long time.  And it's not going to change as long as you've got the same people in power.  We're going to be just living through this cycle of protests and police killings and You know, all kinds of atrocities happening over and over.  You got to do a changing of the guard in order for anything to change for us as a people.  You know, a change in America is long overdue.  One, globally, even better.  You know, but y'all tell me what you think.  Tell me what you think about this story of these 19 families purchasing 97 acres of land and starting a new city for themselves in Georgia.  I wish them the best.  Please leave your comment and subscribe.  Don't forget to hit on the notification bell and I'll see you on the next video.  Peace, family. ",
