            "text": "All right.  We got a new first amendment audit channel called NC street news.  And I'm taking this video up as the earlier parts already been concluded.  and they're going outside and officer Meek here is trying to get ID, but previously our guys already tried to explain to him poster seven.  Meek reads poster seven can't comprehend anything he reads apparently.  I don't even think he's got authority on the post office on federal property, unless possibly they got some kind of a ring, uh, agreement, but which we don't know if they actually have, but you know, poster seven states that you can video in there.  The DS H memo establishes federal property is where you can film and where you can't.  He doesn't care about that.  That or he can't comprehend.  But this video takes place right after Meek here.  And again, I hesitate to use the word officer because he doesn't deserve that title in front of his name.  Now he's going to try to get an ID for a trespass warning, which we know is BS.  In fact, I don't even think North Carolina has an ID law except for If you've been put under arrest, I'm not going to go back and review it.  Cause it really doesn't matter.  This is a trespass warning and you do not have to give ID for a trespass warning.  It's just plain and simple, but me care is going to stumble his way through, try to intimidate.  He's going to lie.  He'll do whatever he can and see if he can, uh, get our auditor to give up his rights and conform to his master.  So here we go with the video. ",

A state building would be a people's building.  Do you hear this, sir?  They're telling me that we don't, the people, the city doesn't fund.  Are you serious?  But anyways.  Sir, I haven't committed a crime.  I know you haven't committed a crime.  Okay, so why would I have to ID?  Because this lady wanted you to move from the premises.  She's in the wrong, sir.  Huh?  She's in the wrong.  Why is she in the wrong?  Sir, they have an outdated Postal 7 on the wall.  It's not outdated.  It says August 7, 2007, man.  Yes, ma'am, I am, ma'am. ",

People don't get their mail on time.  Months and months and months go by.  I come here simply to document my interaction by a city stamp, and I'm being illegally trespassed from a public building.  So do you understand what the general statute on trespassing is?  Sir, I understand that once you ask me to leave, if I return, that's when you can trespass me.  No, sir.  That's when you get my... No, sir.  Let me help you.  When you get my ID is when you ask me to leave, which nobody did.  Well, sir, you won't even give me your ID, but... You haven't... Sir, I haven't returned first, sir.  Dude, don't yell.  Sir.  Please stop yelling.  So this lady- I can't help it.  I get excited when my rights are being infringed on, sir.  But your rights aren't being infringed.  Yes, they are, sir.

You work for the public, sir.  Of course I work for the public.  I'm a private citizen.  I have my Fourth Amendment, sir.  I have the fourth amendment, sir.  So this lady asked you to leave.  No, she didn't.  She asked me to leave when you got here, sir.  That's still asking you to leave.  And what did I do?  And where are we, sir?  We're outside.  Okay.  But she says she has to file a report.  No, sir.  She doesn't need my name for that.  Good citizen.  Good citizen.  All right.  Are we done here?  Nope.  Because how are we not done here?  Okay.  Well, wonderful.  Jesus Christ.  But also, I'd like to talk to you just a little bit.  Thank you.  We can have a civil conversation, all right?  All right.  So, nope, COVID.  I'm not going to touch you.  You took your mask off to approach me, but now no fist bump.  But anyways, so like you said on the paper, you understand that that's just a revision date, right?  Sir, I understand that that's the law.  I'm following the law, sir.  I'm not worried about their policy.  No, that's the law, sir.  That's a federal policy.  That's the law, sir.  Sir, the first amendment of the Constitution, which you swore to uphold, sir.  Sir, listen to me, sir.  First of all, the first amendment gives me the right to come on any public property and record whatever I want.  Sir, this is a post office.  This is federal property.  You know what?  Since you're on your phone, if you look up at any federal... No, I can't.  I'm live streaming right now.  Oh, okay.  Anyways, this is federal property.  This guy is... Exactly.  He said... This guy... Do you hear this, sir?  Unbelievable.  He's telling me that a post office is a private building.  I didn't say it was private.  I said it was federal.  How can you, sir, how can you trespass me from a public building, sir?  I can't trespass you.  They can.  No, she cannot, sir.  She's the manager.  That's a lawsuit, sir.  Do you want to be named defendant?  That's a civil law.  Do you want to be named defendant, sir?  That is a civil law.  Sir, bootlicker.  A bootlet.  See, now right there, that's abrasive wording.  That isn't First Amendment.  Free speech.  Anyway, sir.  Terry, you can go ahead and leave.  Yes, thank you.  Anyway, sir.  That's abrasive language.  Listen, sir.  You can't see that.  That's incendiary speech.  Listen, sir, what I'm telling you is this.  The law says I can go in a public building, sir, and record and document my interaction with any public or government official, sir.  I'm going to your police station next, sir, and I'm going to stand on the sidewalk, and I'm going to record license plates going in and out of there all day, sir.  It is not against the law.  You swore an oath to uphold the Constitution, sir.  That's fine.  Yeah, I did.  So why are you violating and breaking your oath right now, sir?  You're supposed to be here to defend my rights, sir.  You're here to protect me, sir.  I'm here to protect the public, not just you.  I'm the public, sir.  You're an individual.  I'm a private investigator and an independent journalist, sir.  So now you're a private investigator.  Sir.  You just said you were in there to buy a stamp.  So why are you a private investigator?  Listen, listen.  All right, I'll tell you what.  From now on, we're going to be famous.  NG Week.  Yes, sir.  N-G-Meek, man.  This is unbelievable.  A city stamp.  A city stamp.  How can I not?  How can they tell me I can't record and document my interaction with them?  Sir, I was asking you a question, sir.  Can I finish?  I don't want to talk anymore.  If I can't ask my question and get it answered, sir, then no, we can't have a consensual interaction.  Alright.  Bye.  Bye.  I'm supposed to be here to protect and uphold my rights.  This is unbelievable.  This is unbelievable.  Supervisor, make it out here.  He still don't get it.  I ain't done nothing wrong, but yeah, he steady want to ask my name.  On camera, violating to the world, violating my Fourth Amendment right now.  Constantly, sir.  You're constantly asking it for no reason, sir.  You have no reason to.  You have no right.  No, you do not, sir.  Sir, you do not have the right or reason.  I haven't done a single thing wrong.  I have not broken a single law.  I haven't committed a single crime, sir.  Therefore, I should be freely able to travel on my way.  But I'm being detained, right?  Have a good day.  Have a good day.  Greenville Police Department guys. ",

            "text": "All right, so NC Street News is a little worked up.  He's new.  Adrenaline's running.  He's screwed up a few times.  You know, misstatements.  Gets a little heated, but never too far.  And he did a really good job of being respectful.  Hopefully, after he gets a little bit more used to this, he'll calm down.  And I think his... being so worked up, didn't allow him to think straight.  But he's out there trying.  And I hope he keeps going and calms down and then he'll get things a little bit more straight and probably handle things a little bit better.  And I think if he was a little bit more calm, he probably would have made this cop even look dumber than he already was.  At least the cop, I guess, didn't push it too hard.  Realized he couldn't do anything, so I think that pretty much says it all.  He knew he didn't have the authority to force an ID.  Hopefully our guy follows through with this and makes sure that the post office gets it straight next time.  Calls a postmaster general or whoever's in charge of that district, gets it straight at the post office there.  This is PNP News.  Y'all have a good afternoon, good day.  We're out of here.  Bye. ",
