            "text": "Hi, I want to make this quick video.  Oh, I'm top over this fucking George Floyd situation.  You already know who that is.  You know who that is.  But you don't know who, let me just check again, what was his name again?  Timper.  I've just started Steam and now Steam's coming on for some reason.  I clicked on the wrong button.  That's okay.  This guy's name that you don't know, I'll show you.  This is what annoys me about the media.  We all know George Floyd.  We all know what happened.  We all know that it was wrong.  Nobody's saying he deserved to die, but I'm just curious as to how the whole thing went down before the cameras were rolling, you know?  Anyway.  The media are covering this.  Every media outlet that you can imagine is covering this.  It's trending on Twitter.  The usual suspects are now rioting over this.  And I'm going to show you a case where almost the identical thing happened to a white man.  And you don't know his name.  You've never heard of this guy.  The mainstream media didn't cover this.  Only local newspapers covered this.  The mainstream media didn't cover it.  It just shows what the big-nosed media keep doing.  They keep trying to pit blacks against whites.  Black people, you're victims.  White people, they're evil.  You should hate each other and fight each other while us with the big noses sit back and enjoy the show.  You know, I keep doing it every time.  I keep doing it.  Like, we already knew that they were going to start rioting and looting and all that business.  We knew it was going to happen.  It's happening as I make this video.  It's happening.  Oh, how is it?  How come the police are using tear gas against those that are rioting, but they didn't use tear gas against those armed citizens at City Hall?  What a great comparison that is.  Have you seen that one?  It's only been on Twitter 3000 times so far by different people.  Aye.  Why is it that the police are using tear gas against the people committing crimes and not against those people who are not committing crimes?  I mean, these people are fucking idiots.  They're just idiots, right?  They're just idiots.  They take two situations that have nothing to do with each other and say, how come that?  Well, I'm taking two situations that are almost identical.  And asking, how come the media aren't covering this one, and how come you don't know this guy's name, but yet you know George Floyd's name, and they're covering this non-stop, right?  So let's get on with it.  Let's get on with it and I'll show you.  Oh, by the way, I know what some people are going to say, right?  What some people are going to say is... so I'm going to predict what you're going to say, right, especially if you're a fucking jogger, and you're on here trying to act all fucking smart, I know what you're going to say, you're going to say, well, George Floyd's death, that was filmed, that was caught on video, and that's why it went all over social media, and the reason the mainstream media are covering it is because of the public outrage over it, so the media left with no choice but to cover it.  I know that's what you're going to fucking say, but you can stop that shit before you even fucking say it, because that filthy jogger that was caught on video last week beating a defenceless old man, like he must have in the video, without exaggeration, he must have punched this guy about a hundred times.  This filthy fucking jogger did that, It was all over social media.  There was an outrage about that, but the mainstream media didn't cover it, so don't give me that crap, okay?  We know why they're covering the George Floyd one and not any other one.  And when I say any other one, I mean one like this, right?  You're gonna kill me.  Dallas police body cam footage reveals the final minutes of Tony Timpa's life.  That's the Tony Timpa that you've never heard of.  And you've never heard of Tony Timper because Tony Timper is white.  That's why you've never heard of him.  Because if the mainstream media, as I say, the Dallas Morning News, you won't find this on CNN or the BBC.  The reason... The big ones don't cover this non-stop, and okay, you might find a story buried somewhere on CNN once, because they'll go, by the way, a guy died there.  Anyway, look at that squirrel on a tree.  You know, no, I'm talking about constant coverage and outrage the way they do with George Floyd.  The reason you won't find that is because they know that if they show this, white people won't riot and give them more headlines.  Anyway, Timpa wailed and pleaded for help more than 30 times as officers pinned his shoulders, knees and neck to the ground in 2016.  2016, four years ago, and you've never heard of this guy before.  You haven't, right?  Don't feel bad.  I hadn't heard of him either, you know, until all this shit came up.  I hadn't heard of him either and I don't blame myself for that.  It's the media's fault that I don't know this guy's name.  It is definitely the mainstream media's fault that I don't know this guy's name and that you don't know this guy's name.  So don't feel bad for not knowing his name.  It's not your fault.  And Tony Timpa, well, just imagine Tony Timpa was black and you hadn't heard this guy's name, right?  That's okay.  There was a tweet the other day that somebody posted, right?  Just a little thought experiment for yourself.  It was interesting.  And they said that 70 to 75% of police deaths are of white males or Hispanic males.  Name two of them.  tells you everything you need to know.  Tony Timpa wailed and pleaded for help for more than 30 times as Dallas police officers pinned his shoulders, knees and neck to the ground.  You're going to kill me.  You're going to kill me.  You're going to kill me, he said.  After Timpa felt unconscious... The officers who had him in handcuffs assumed he was asleep and didn't confirm that he was breathing or feel for a pulse.  As precious minutes passed, the officers laughed and joked.  Imagine this was a black man.  The officers laughed and joked about waking Timper up for school and making him waffles for breakfast.  Imagine the police were caught making those jokes and it was a black man.  Just imagine.  In fact, you would know Tony's name if that was the case.  Body camera footage obtained Tuesday by the Dallas Morning News shows, not by CNN, not by MSNBC, not by BBC, no, no, no, by the Dallas Morning News, a fucking newspaper you've probably never heard of, shows.  first responders waited at least four minutes after Timper became unresponsive to begin CPR.  His nose was buried in the grass while officers claimed to hear him snoring, apparently unaware that the unarmed man was drawing his last breaths.  The unarmed man who was handcuffed and had his legs zip-tied together.  That man, whose name you don't know.  The officers pinned his handcuffed arms behind his back for nearly 14 minutes.  That's longer than what happened to George Floyd.  George Floyd was under 10 minutes.  This was 14 minutes and you don't know his name.  and zip-tied his legs together.  By the time he was loaded onto a gurney and put into an ambulance, the 32-year-old was dead.  By the way, another thing, just to point out, I'm here right now just to keep my place, just to point out that at no point in this story No point in the entire fucking article did they mention his skin colour.  That's another thing that you should take note of, you know.  And by the way, they shouldn't mention his skin colour because it's not relevant.  It's not a relevant part of the story, but... But if he was black, they would have, in the exact same fucking situation, they would have mentioned his skin colour and the skin colour of the officer numerous times.  But they don't do that here.  For some bizarre reason, they don't do that here.  By the way, I'm not going to watch the video.  I'll leave a link to that article.  You can check it out yourself.  The news obtained Dallas Police Department body camera footage after a three-year fight for records related to Timper's death.  A federal judge ruled on Monday in favor of a motion by the news and NBC5, that's one of the smaller channels, not the main one, to release records from his death, saying the public has a compelling interest in understanding what truly took place during a fatal exchange between a citizen and law enforcement.  Yes.  But you didn't put it on your main channel though, did you?  Well, you won't hear Rachel Maddow talking about this, will you?  Oh, of course you won't.  Of course you fucking won't.  They won't get the usual fucking suspects, Don Lemon and all that.  You won't get them, you know, in fucking, what's that, Anderson Cooper?  You know, Anderson Cooper.  Hey, I've just had a baby with my boyfriend.  Yay!  Wait a minute.  What colour's the baby, Anderson?  Why didn't you choose a black surrogate, Anderson?  What's that about?  What?  What's going on there, Anderson?  Are you a racist?  Could have picked a black one, but he picked a white one.  Isn't that funny?  Isn't that funny, isn't it?  I just thought I'd mention that.  It has nothing to do with this story.  I just thought it was interesting.  Oh, I'm a social justice warrior.  I love the blacks.  Why not have a black baby then?  Oh, thanks.  Ha ha ha.  Oh, these people.  Oh, my God.  Timper called 911 on August 10th, 2016 from the parking lot of a Dallas porn store saying he was afraid they needed help.  Wait a minute.  He called 911?  Fuck's sake.  Saying he was afraid he needed help, he told a dispatcher he suffered from schizophrenia and depression and was off his prescription medication.  The news first reported his death in a 2017 investigation that showed Dallas police refused to say how a man who had called 911 for help ended up dead.  He called the police.  This is even worse.  This gets worse, by the way.  It just keeps getting worse.  Imagine a black man called the police and the police killed him.  You would know his name.  You would know his fucking name.  I've been posting this story, by the way, on a lot of tweets.  You know, and somebody said to me yesterday, I'd never heard of this before.  Of course you hadn't heard of it before, because he's white.  Why would you hear of it?  He's white.  His life doesn't mean anything.  The big noses in the media, they'll give two shits.  Oh, what do you mean big noses?  Isn't that kind of racist?  Fuck off!  The newly obtained video and records, part of a lawsuit filed by Timpa's family in federal court alleging excessive force, contradict key claims Dallas police have made in defending the officer's actions.  Police incident reports recounting that officers' version of events claimed Timpa's behaviour that night was aggressive and combative.  But that doesn't mean he deserves to die, is what they'll say, right?  Oh no, they won't, because they're too busy rioting right now.  The video shows Timper writhing at times and clearly struggling to breathe.  This is the same, right?  Asking the officers to stop pinning him down.  This is the same thing that happened with George.  The same thing.  But you didn't hear about this one.  Un-fucking-real.  On a custodial death report submitted to the state in 2016, the department answered no to questions about whether Timper resisted arrest, threatened or fought officers.  Police had previously claimed to use only enough force necessary to block Timper from rolling into a busy section of Mockingbird Lane.  Oh, right, right.  Ah, see, so you had him to the ground and you had his face in the grass where he couldn't breathe.  for his protection, right, for his protection.  A really, really, really great, great fucking story.  In the first minute, Timper rolls around near the curb, but the video shows a police car clearly blocks traffic.  about a minute later near the bus bench where the officer had pinned him.  Several officers continue pressing his restrained body into the ground.  Same thing that happened with George.  They keep showing this photo of the white officer on George's neck.  There was actually three officers holding him down, by the way.  Not just one, not just white.  There was an Asian there as well.  Have you heard?  Anything about that?  No, okay.  Because one of the police were Asian, but they don't want to mention that.  For some strange reason, the big nosies don't want to mention that.  Hmm, I wonder why.  I wonder why that could be.  He had already been handcuffed by a private security guard before police arrived, so the police arrived and this man was already in handcuffs.  And you don't know his name.  He never threatens to hurt or kill the police, and you don't know his name.  The footage also shows the officers mocking Timpa as he struggled to live.  Shortly after, one officer ridicules Timpa's repeated cries for help.  An officer notes that he appears to be out cold.  They joke that he's merely asleep and tried to wake him.  It's time for school.  Wake up.  One officer mimics a teen saying, I don't want to go to school.  Five more minutes, Mum.  They joke about buying him new shoes for the first day of school and making him a special breakfast, laughing loudly.  This is a man that's dead on the ground, whose name you don't know, whose name you've never heard before.  The mainstream media haven't mentioned this, haven't went on and on about it, the way they have about this George's case.  And I would say so far, this is fucking worse.  This is worse.  It took longer.  They made jokes.  You know, he was already in cuffs when they arrived.  He called the police.  This is worse than Georgie's story.  But we didn't hear Timper's story.  It's unclear from the video why Dallas Fire Rescue medical responders don't intervene immediately after Tim Pelugi's consciousness.  I was unable to assess the patient due to his combativeness, said one of the first responders in a newly obtained affidavit.  This goes on, I'll just go on for, it goes on quite a while.  I don't want to read the whole thing, but as you can see there, right, I'm sure you've heard enough, right?  But I'll leave a link to that article and you can go through it all yourself, okay?  But this is worse than what happened to George.  But we didn't hear about this one.  Another one, this is just bonus.  Just want to throw a wee bonus story in there, you know?  Let me throw just a wee bonus story in there of another man who you've never heard of, right?  Just... Just for fun.  Just for funsies, right?  Here we go.  Here's another man that you've never heard of, right?  Deaf man shot dead by police while using sign language.  Police allegedly shot dead a deaf man outside his front door as he tried to communicate with them in sign language.  Officers in North Carolina had attempted to pull over the 29-year-old Daniel Harris, whose name you've never heard of, last Thursday for speeding.  According to NBC, is it NBC, is it NBC the main one?  or is it NBC... Oh, it's actually from NBC.  NBC actually covered this.  Can you believe that?  Fucking unbelievable.  NBC covered it.  Wow.  I am shocked.  Although, as I say, most of them will cover it, you know, like the once, as I say.  Do you hear about the scar that died?  And also, look who said plastic surgery, you know, and then they bury it and they don't fucking talk about it again.  They don't do that when the victim's black, right?  So, okay, they did mention it.  Good for them.  Once.  But instead of slowing down, Mr Harris continued on his way home.  One witness reported Mr Harris was then shot and killed almost immediately after exiting his vehicle.  The witness said it appeared the victim had attempted to communicate with an officer via sign language when he was fired on outside of his home.  On a widely shared fundraising page, his family, a number of who are also hearing impaired, said they wanted to raise awareness of how police should confront deaf people.  The post adds that states should change the systems so that a police stop triggers an alert showing that the person is deaf.  With this change, Daniel will be a hero in the deaf community, the post read.  No, no, that's... Probably some kind of misunderstanding where he's got out of the car and he's given all that and the police right away thought, gang signs, and then shot him.  I don't know what went on there.  The point is, white man gets shot, killed by the police, completely unarmed.  He's deaf.  This is a story, right?  Nah.  Nah, not really.  Because he's not black.  He's not black, so it's not a story.  By the way, there'll be loads of stories like this.  I just thought I'd cover that, especially that Timper case.  Let me just get his name again.  Tony Timper, right?  Tony Timper.  A name that you'd never heard before this video, probably.  And he probably doesn't even have a trending hashtag.  He'll have a hashtag, but not a trending hashtag.  Anyway.  Nothing more to say on this.  The whole thing's fucking depressing.  Stop letting the big noses turn us against each other.  Their worst nightmare is if black people and white people don't hate each other.  Stop giving them what they want.  It's alright to hate the joggers though.  You know the ones that beat up on old pensioners.  It's alright to hate them.  Thank you very much for listening.  Until next time. ",
