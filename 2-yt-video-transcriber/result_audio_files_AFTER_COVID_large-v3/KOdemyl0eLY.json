So with that being said, this is a PSA for all the men out there and all the boys who think they're men, but they're actually boys.  This is going to be the summer of canceling boys.  All of my friends are attractive.  All of my friends are successful.  All of my friends have something going on.  Almost every single one of them have an issue with men.  They're all successful.  They're all intelligent.  They're all good people.  But if all of these women, including myself, are having issues, then I have to think, it might not be us.  It might be you.  It is not just the guys in Los Angeles, Nashville, Dallas, and they're not any better in the Midwest.  Quite frankly, I think they're trash all over this country.  I've made notes.  This is how invested I am in this because I've been thinking about this for about two weeks solid now.  Are you actually single single?  That means single.  That is the first question, believe it or not, that needs to be asked.  And ladies, you should be asking it.  Because in 2020, it's not a given anymore that a guy that's actively pursuing you is actually single.  Women do not want a pen pal.  We don't want a texting pal.  We quite frankly don't care if you text us all day or if you don't text us at all.  If you're not going to make a plan to actually see us in person, not interested.  Make... Plan.  I know it's not rocket science, but men of 2020.  It seems like it's pretty difficult for you to figure out and I'm not a feminist.  So, please don't take this as a feminist rant.  I love men.  if you want to date a girl that has nothing going on then that's fine.  But please do not mix in people like me and my friends who have something going on.  Quite frankly, we take it as an insult if we find out that you are also talking to five Tatianas who have nothing going on.  So value, value. ",

I love a good Instagram story y'all know I do.  I love a good boomerang.  I love a good whatever but if that's all you do men.  if that's all she does probably Houston we have a problem.  once I'm turned off I am turned off and I don't care anymore.  Don't be a bitch.  Don't be butt hurt.  You did it to yourself, okay?  And it's no longer my problem.  Now it's become a personal problem of yours.  I do have high standards and high expectations.  You don't really have to be Brad Pitt.  You don't have to be famous.  You don't even really have to make a lot of money or have a really fantastic job.  You just have to be determined.  You have to be in some way successful in that you want to attain some certain kind of success for yourself.  You're driven.  You have goals.  You can handle a woman with standards.  That's not going to turn you off.  And you're going to put in the effort to be with somebody like myself or my friends.  We deserve that.  And we will not compromise our standards.  It will be a cold day in hell when I chase a man.  We have all dealt with men who treat us like we are not good enough.  No.  The problem is we are too enough and you can't handle it.  Number one.  Are you single?  No, really.  Two.  make plans.  we don't want a pen pal three value value value.  someone who has value consistency be consistent don't be great and then fade out.  and then don't fade out and then think that you're gonna fade back in because they ain't gonna work.

            "text": "and last but not least if all else fails Gentlemen, sometimes the gods give us direct messages and signs as to what they want from us and what they're trying to show us.  And I think the case of Tomi Lahren, whom many of you might know, certainly the last few days as she's been making the waves and the rounds, because she tells us a whole lot.  She's supposedly a conservative pundit, and conservative here means absolutely nothing.  But if you listen to the rant, and I'm assuming you have, then you know what she thinks about men.  What does she say?  Men are trash.  Now, it's very interesting the multitude of responses to this rant of hers, this viral video that she made of which you've only heard a condensed version, but I do think if there were ever, and I do mean ever, a more direct message telling you to go your own way, this is it.  And let's contrast that with the message of the PUAs.  I saw that The king of the PUA, Zerola Tomasi, was very quick to offer his analysis of a two-hour-plus rant on her part.  And, of course, every now and then he makes some good points, points that are rather obvious, observations about the dating market or what have you.  But this idea that he proposes of spinning plates, and you may or may not know what that means.  Spinning plates means to date as many women as possible.  But at the same time, he's pointing out the problems with women in general and specifically with Tomi Lahren.  So what is the end goal, for example, of spinning plates, going on endless dates, pursuing pussy, and then rinsing and repeating ad nauseam?  To find a good one?  He's certainly not talking about that.  In fact, that's all he talks about is spinning plates.  Now, I understand he has a reputation and this is what he needs to propagate, but I want to talk about it from a very different angle.  When I hear things like this, It reminds me of the echoes of the past, the kinds of women I would listen to when I might be in a cafe eavesdropping, unintentionally, of course, because they're typically quite loud, reading a book or what have you, and hearing what they're saying about their men in private when the men aren't around.  And I've heard some pretty nasty things in my time.  things that are at least as grievous as this, if not worse.  And so let me reemphasize and restress something I've said many, many times over the years.  Women don't like men.  Having a strong pull, an attraction to the opposite sex and vice versa, does not imply real affinity and real affection.  And when I mean real affinity and real affection, fondness, I'm talking about a bond that goes beyond the hormonal.  Because let's be honest, this is a case, a very clear case, of someone who, best case scenario, you might have a hormonal bond with and that's about it.  So the PUAs are saying spin more plates.  The normies might give you two conflicting messages.  They might say not all women are like that if they don't find what she's saying particularly appealing or savory, or alternatively they'll just say you're just bitter and she's right about everything she's saying.  Probably more the latter than the former, but in all likelihood some kind of mixture of that.  But this is a direct, and I do mean direct, advertisement for going your own way.  Men who haven't experienced lots of relationships but are unsure of the path they're on, I present to you the display of this rant on the part of Tomi Lahren.  Think about all the theoretical hoops you would have to jump through to appeal to this type of person.  They're endless, assuming you're not the Giga Chad Alpha that so many people talk about.  But even then, it only lasts so long.  So the real value in this message, as she decides to call men trash and tell them that they need to value things, whatever that means, is that you need to learn to value yourself and ignore this kind of stuff.  Now, I'm not a dictator.  As I've said recently, I tend to gently prod people along if they have interest in things.  But to me, this just vindicates and reifies my beliefs about the path of going your own way, about MGTOW, and the fact that this whole landscape is just filled with this kind of broken BS.  Who on Earth, what man on planet Earth would want to deal with that?  And to his credit, even Rolo Tomasi points that out.  She sounds like an HR manager, he says.  Well, I don't disagree with him.  Imagine having to deal with that.  And imagine, furthermore, that there are just tons and tons and tons of women like that.  ranting, raving, complaining, and as I said just prior, if I had had a recording device with me, the amount of audio material I would have had over the years, just being in the presence of so-called girl gatherings, bitching and complaining about their so-called men, well, I probably could have an audio book thrice over.  I think we really, really need to point these things out when they occur.  Now it's not that important that people make fun of MGTOW or think it's stupid or whatever or unnatural.  But this, this is the perfect reason why most men don't want to deal with women's BS or relationships and certainly not marriage.  Imagine being chained to this person or someone similar.  And I could go into the details of what she's ranting about.  You need to value things.  She doesn't care about what you do.  That's never true.  When it comes to women, and in general, more broadly, human beings, pay attention to what women and people do, not what they say.  What was her background like?  What kind of men did she involve herself with?  Did she care about money back then, the kind of jobs they were pursuing?  I'll leave that to you to decide.  Because here's the thing.  women only attribute the value of the values of a man to things that rake in money and dough.  so for example if you're a financier or an investment banker or a doctor that's great.  you're using your nog and you're making money but if you're a biologist and specifically And entomologists want to categorize every butterfly on planet Earth and travel the world in the process of doing so.  That's lame.  It doesn't make money.  It's all about the material.  So value means the material.  And I pointed this out years ago.  People say women value intelligence.  No, they don't.  They value certain fruits of intelligence.  as long as those fruits are material and represent wealth and status.  if you're trying to work on some obscure mathematical problem that nobody cares about i guarantee you she's not going to care either.  nor will she care about when you're as i said going out to the amazon rainforest to catalog the butterflies that live there.  That sort of thing doesn't count.  Intelligence, value, it only matters when it's about money and status.  And that's just the way the cookie crumbles.  We know how women are wired.  That's how they are.  So again, if ever there were a clear message why you might want to go your own way, well, I submit this heritant to you.  Awful to listen to, but imagine actually being together with this person and listening to her day in and day out or being married to the person.  Intolerable.  And it's hysterical the way PUAs go about it with their talk of spinning plates endlessly until what?  Because let's be honest, they're not telling you how to find the quote-unquote right wife or right woman.  They have no clue about that.  No, they just tell you to spin plates endlessly.  Throughout my life, I honestly have to say... that the freedom to live my life on my own terms has been the most valuable thing I've ever experienced.  To no longer pretend to care, at the end of the day that's the real power of MGTOW, that's the real power of making peace with yourself and the world that you live in than just going your own way.  You can do what you want on your own terms, and it's true that no one else is going to care, but you don't need to care either.  As long as they don't stand in your way, you're going to be fine.  And I guarantee you that this message alone is going to send a lot of men on the path of going their own way without ever having viewed any MGTOW material, which is a good thing ultimately.
