We really don't expect to win a lot of the district court cases, but ultimately the Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court.  we'll have to get it right.  We're very clear on the law and the facts on multiple issues, and we haven't even begun to present the big fraud case yet that I am still working on.  And it's going to be a blockbuster. ",

It sounded like you guys were making progress going down a road of investigation.  But as I think anybody understands, when you're trying to lay out a case, it takes time to find out what you have.  You had a bit of a rub with Tucker Carlson this week, who basically said you didn't have any evidence when they asked you to come on.  What is the truth of the matter there?

I simply didn't have time to do it then, and I sent him a copy of one of the compelling affidavits that we have in the case, and apparently that wasn't sufficient for him.  He was having a little bit of a tantrum, but I didn't see or hear what he said, and I haven't had time to listen to what he said after that.  I'm just proceeding on my course of getting the case ready to prove in a court which is where we prove cases of law not in the media. ",

We've got evidence from people who saw fake ballots being created.  We've got all kinds of different evidence.  And then we've got the statistical and mathematical evidence that's absolutely irrefutable.  I mean, a coin doesn't land on the same side when you flip it 186,000 times.  You can't just inject 86,000 Biden votes and expect anybody to believe those are real.  And they're not.  No matter how you analyze the statistics, whether it's a predictive model or the actual data as it comes in, it doesn't hold water.  And we've got other testimonial evidence that appears to be coming in now to indicate the Democrats literally added 35,000 votes to every Democratic candidate to begin with. ",
