It was a day near to the days where he suffered losses in Pennsylvania as the Supreme Court threw out the final contestation of that election from the Trump team.  Wisconsin recounts in multiple counties showed that Joe Biden won.  In fact, he won by a little bit more than he originally had been counted to win.  And Trump was asked about about whether he will concede and about when the Electoral College does vote, if he will actually concede.  Let's go to that side.  Just to be clear, if the Electoral College votes for Joe Biden, will you concede? ",

And that is because that desk was tiny, a weensy little desk.  Look at this photo, and it's just comically small.  The flag behind him seems to be bigger than the desk itself.  His knees seem to be touching the top of the desk.  His elbows are just raised as he's continuing to say it's fraud.  And that soon became the story of his first press conference back after this loss, right?  Is that the tiny desk.  So many a fun meme, we have a play school meme.

It appeared that he could only sit Or that the chair itself accentuated a certain portion of his body that we've been talking about for a little bit of time because it looks extra stuffed.  The hashtag Diaper Don, y'all, was trending because as you can see there, if you can see, for those of you who saw this, Trump's booty was protruding, okay?  His booty was protruding and it was sticking out of the little coattails of his jacket.  And it was just on swole, okay?  It was, he got a thickie and I'm just gonna say it.  And I don't know whether it's natural or whether he's using something to stuff it.  And ergo, diaper Don started massively trending.  And as you all know, hashtag show me the undies.  If he actually doesn't wear diapers, just show us your big boy pants.  That was a perfect excuse for me to tweet that.  But Trump did take notice that diaper Don was trending and himself tweeted, Twitter is sending out totally false quote trends that have absolutely nothing to do with what's really trending in the world.
