            "text": "You know, the one thing that I cherish is a pastor that can receive prophetic word, watch over it, pray over it, even for an individual in his congregation or if it's a word for his county or his city or his country.  He takes time to pray over it and not just condemn it or say, well, that came from such and such a person.  I don't like that person.  So am I going to accept the word?  And that's happened to me a number of times where a word has come to me from people that I didn't really expect it to come from.  And God said, that is me.  Because God can use a donkey to speak if he wants to.  So Pastor Mike Fasciuto is with me today on this one important issue.  And that is prophecy.  Prophecy.  Has it affected you, Mike?  I mean, has prophecy guided you?  Has prophecy ever been a force to be reckoned with in terms of your destiny and where you are today? ",

So for myself personally, You know, when Jesus was challenged in the wilderness, he always spoke the word to Satan.  And when the devil challenges me personally, my family, I have the word of the Lord.  He challenges me about my children.  I have the word of the Lord.  So, wow.  Hope is so important.  Our future, we need to know what our future is all about.  And the prophetic leads us right into that. ",

I'll tell you one of the prophecies, probably it's one of mine, is that God prophesied about how he was going to expand you and you're going to have a huge congregation.  And then it fell to pieces.  Really, literally, you didn't have the large congregation.  Right.  And I didn't even know or think about that prophecy.  But what happened was, what happens many times is we hear prophecy, we think, it's going to happen now.  Now let's fast forward 10, 15 years, whatever.  Look at you now.  God's placed you as a pastor, probably the pastor, over literally hundreds of thousands of people.  Now, whether they accept you as a pastor or not doesn't matter because I know at least 10,000 or 20,000 of our viewers have accepted you as one of their pastors at least.  So would you say that's a good example of you were given a word and you were a little confused, but now you suddenly see it in such a vast way? ",

We try to figure out how something, what it's going to look like.  And we just need to know.  God said it, it's going to come to pass, but it's probably never the way we think it's going to be, but it's always better. ",

            "text": "I always tell people, get the how out of you, because how is, you don't ask God how, because let him work it out.  But it is important that we understand a little bit of the prophetic word.  So... You know, a lot of times prophetic words don't happen because of various, for various reasons.  You know, God's plan was to get the children of Israel in at a certain time, and they were disobedient, and, you know, they wandered around for 40 years.  And so we question, we would question it, you know, and say, well, God, you said, but then we didn't do accordingly, and he had to lead us a different way.  That changes the timing sometimes.  But here's one of the questions, not the questions, the things I'd like to discuss with you quickly.  What really irritates me terribly is when preachers, prophets, teachers, and people in general expect nothing but judgment, condemnation, and the addressing of man's sin through the mouths of prophets or through prophecy.  Now, what you would probably say to me if you were sitting here arguing or debating, let's say that, you'd probably say, ah, but look at the Old Testament prophet.  They'd come in and Israel would be sinning and they'd condemn them and they'd judge them and they'd punish, speak about their sin.  Yes, you're right.  We are no longer under old covenant law.  We are in a new covenant grace system.  Now, what does that mean?  Does it mean you can sin?  No, grace is higher than law.  He came to fulfill the law and the prophets.  But this is what I want to say to you.  The prophets today have a slightly different calling.  In that, they don't have to address sin because the Holy Spirit convicts.  Now, if you want to say, well, the Holy Spirit, He must stand one side because people don't listen to the Holy Spirit.  It's your conscience He gets a hold of.  The Holy Spirit has a far better job of convicting or convincing, if you wish, of sin than I'm ever going to do.  Because I may make you mad.  I may... I've seen it.  When I was young in my ministry, I would speak about people's sin and it didn't work.  They'd go out and they'd be scared for two or three days and they'd start straight up.  I remember a prophet coming to our church when I was younger and everybody was so dead scared of this guy because everyone he called out, he'd speak about their sin.  And oddly enough, their sin was always sexual.  And eventually I started looking at this guy and thinking, you've got the problem.  That's why you're picking on everybody.  Is God not more than just picking you out about your sin?  Because it doesn't work.  Never worked in the Old Testament, won't work in the New Testament.  There are times to address national sins, global sins.  It's important.  But I will prove to you out of Scripture.  That the way that God uses prophecy today is to bring out the treasure that is inside of you.  It's important that you understand that.  Now, have you ever, I mean, what is your take on that?  Do you think prophecy should address sin?  How do you feel about that, being a pastor anyway? ",

            "text": "Well, clearly, God's word says it's the goodness of God that leads a man to repentance.  And, of course, you're teaching on.  when unbelievers are present and the church is prophesying, they become convicted, you know, and They come to God.  They come to Christ.  The world doesn't need to be beaten down.  They need to be led.  What's the job of the Holy Spirit?  To lead all men unto Christ.  Who wants to follow someone that's beating on you?  If you have a father that's abused you, that's perversion.  So our father doesn't abuse us.  He loves us.  He sent his son to die for us while we were yet sinners. ",

He's in his own time.  And I had to teach him, Jacob, it doesn't work like that in the world.  So every morning there's this little fight that goes on where I say, Jacob, you're running late.  Look, we've got five minutes.  And one day it just wasn't working.  And one day he was a little early, and I felt the Spirit nudge me and saying, compliment him on what he did right.  So I said, Jacob, you did. ",
