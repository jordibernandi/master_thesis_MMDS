            "text": "As a female wrestler, I've wrestled both men and women.  I can attest to the biological difference.  Wrestling men is a whole different game.  My sophomore year, I was wrestling a senior.  The ending score was like nine to seven or something really close and I threw up immediately after.  I won.  The guy looked really sad at the end.  It was like one of his last matches and he lost to a girl that was younger than him.  I'm Olivia Rondo, and I started wrestling on the boys team in high school.  At first, it was really tough.  During my freshman year, I won my first match, then lost all of the others because of my inexperience and the strength difference.  I didn't want to go through those losses again, so during the off season, I worked 10 times as hard, competed in national tournaments, and got mentally and physically stronger.  That next year, I went on a winning streak and even wrestled on varsity.  Because I was forced to adapt to wrestling with a biological disadvantage, I went on to dominate the women's arena.  I became a three-time state champion, six-time All-American, and three-time national champion.  I was also part of the 2017 Olympic Development Team.  For college, I was recruited to a women's team with the expectation that I would be only competing against other biological women.  That is what I believe to be fair.  Very few women can hold their own against men in combat sports.  I've only been able to do so with my experience and work ethic.  In 2020, now we have to deal with biological men in women's sports.  Biologically male MMA fighter Fallon Fox fractured their opponent's skull during a fight. ",

            "text": "Even while transitioning, estrogen will not change someone's height, arm span, lung capacity, or bone structure.  It will not erase all of their male strength.  Does this sound fair?  It's becoming a real safety and equality issue for real female athletes, yet we are expected to be okay with it, all in the name of diversity.  The original American feminists fought hard to get separate spaces for women to compete against each other, and now the left is erasing that progress.  Nothing is equal about biological men invading women's spaces. ",
