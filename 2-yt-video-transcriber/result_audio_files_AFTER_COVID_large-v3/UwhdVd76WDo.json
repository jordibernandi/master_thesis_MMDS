            "text": "Hello everyone, my name is Jennifer Molesky.  This is my YouTube channel.  Today we're going to do some commenting on comments.  Not a million, you know, and I'm sorry about that.  As someone said to me a couple weeks ago when I didn't respond to them, They said, well, why don't you respond to me?  That's pretty rude.  I said, if I responded to everyone, it would be like six hours.  They're like, yeah, that'd be okay.  But really, it wouldn't, right?  So let's get into it first with, I'm going to read these out loud.  MJ says, here's a question.  There seems to be an abundance of available free information, self-esteem, ambition, entitlement, egoism, greed, and big mouth hostility among people nowadays, as well as a shortage of personal responsibility, sense of duty, tolerance, modesty, and reason.  What may be some of the reasons?  I have two, I have two.  And I mentioned this before, and I can't remember what video.  In the 70s, well, in the 60s, there wasn't that many TVs in living rooms.  And in comparison from the 70s to now, like we're all super connected.  Otherwise we couldn't do this.  But in the 70s, there was a peak of, there was more televisions in family homes than ever before.  millions.  At that same time when people were, you know, there wasn't that many channels.  So the culture was very shared.  And around that time, there was a boy named, I think it was John, Adam.  I can't, I think Adam.  And he was abducted and killed.  Okay.  Which happened before.  I mean, it wasn't like a spike, but for the first time ever, it was raised in the American parents' consciousness that their kid could get kidnapped and murdered.  And what happened from that was the helicopter parenting revolution began, where everyone was very concerned that their kid could be kidnapped and murdered.  So it's also when nerd culture began, you know, and it was pretty cool to be a nerd instead of a tough guy.  And I mean, there's, I'm not saying there's anything wrong with being a nerd, but it was a, it.  And I don't think that that helps anyone be self-responsible when you're not forced into nature in the world.  You're held back as long as possible until you're 18 and then you're on a protected campus.  Okay, I digress from that.  And then number two, I would say, because I was thinking, well, who were the parents of these people to allow themselves to become helicopter parents?  What was the mentality?  And I thought about credit cards and borrowing money and debt and credit.  And that was one of the first time, that was the first time that someone could buy something that they hadn't earned yet.  They weren't responsible monetarily for their decisions anymore, not like it used to be.  So those are two of my opinions as to why it is the way it is or was the way it is.  Was?  Wait, what?  Okay.  Let's go into gray matters.  Gray matters.  We have a shortage of testosterone in the West.  It's not difficult to understand why.  Boys are not raised to become actual men.  So why would their hormones not reflect that?  And who's raising and schooling these wissified creatures?  Hmm, who indeed?  So I'm going to put a link up to Where's Your Masculinity, a story and synopsis kind of of a book called Iron John.  And in that video, I talk about how there's not any more rites of passage.  And this is what he says.  Also, until recently, Boy Scouts were the last resource.  There's no initiation anymore.  Who's raising these children?  It's single women.  So let's move on to the next comment.  Barnabas Cossie.  He says many things.  So feel free to read his comment.  The part that I want to... talk about is yesterday my ex-girl told me that she wants a kid from me.  she doesn't mind if i go and have my separate life.  you're an alpha you're an alpha male.  why are you so shocked that women want children from you?  she she said this tells you a lot about what kind of man i am.  by the way i'm 24 and she's 13 doesn't even have a bad case of baby rabies.  man man please don't contribute to the creation of a child, especially from a woman who doesn't care if you're around.  To me, that's someone who actually doesn't care about her child.  She's being selfish and greedy.  And I think you would be selfish and greedy if you just were a stud for hire.  And I think she just wants to be able to tell her friends, especially if you are what you say you are, which is a high, a high what?  What am I trying to say?  Zipper doesn't even know.  Basically a man that has, has options.  She probably just wants to tell her friends that she's pregnant with your child.  Please don't do that.  I bet gray matters agrees with me.  Do what you want.  It's your life, but self-responsibility, which, which goes back to MJ, you know, This is all tied together, kind of.  Ah, I like this one.  Brian Williams.  He did not use the word shortage, but he reflects, there's a lot of comments like this.  It says, your definition of a real man is BS.  I would love to see your partner as I would love to see a real man.  I'm an ex-military, ex-police, and have never seen a real man as you described.  All right, so I wrote down, because I even said this is my definition.  And by the way, I would hope that every man and woman that is listening to this has an idea of what their partner's attributes would have to be to qualify for you to date them or marry them.  Okay, what I mean by that is, I think we all have an idea of what a real woman is or a real man.  And since we live in a society where we're free to think and free to speak on it, I don't quite see the dilemma.  Plus, then we would be wrong for each other, see?  Because you're like, no, I'm not that, or I don't respect your definition of it.  All right, so... I said that it was spent time cultivating himself strong, patient, stoic, capable, accepting.  He does what he can and accepts what he can't.  He doesn't let wrong penetrate his world.  So just to be a little snarky, I'm going to go on the opposite of that.  and Okay, so a real man has not spent time cultivating himself.  He is not strong.  He is weak.  He is not patient.  He is impatient.  He is not stoic.  He lets all emotions and what he can't control bother him.  He is incapable.  He does not accept.  Wait, how do I say this?  Accepting.  He does what he can.  He doesn't do what he can.  And he's pissed off about what he can't.  And he lets wrong penetrate his world.  So maybe somewhere in the middle is right for you.  And obviously there's more to a man.  I mean, come on.  Men cry and they're emotional and they're loving and they're nurturing and they're sweet and they're all the things.  But probably stoic more than crying.  You'll probably find him stronger than you will see him crying every day or frustrated.  is kind of my take on it.  And I might have a follow-up.  Let's see the next person, but thank you for the comment.  Cause you did represent a lot of, a lot of the other comments.  I'm curious about your opinion.  I'm curious about your opinion about couples where the female is a breadwinner and the male is a stay at home dad.  Do you think the message is still valid when swapping the genders or is there some law of the genders that will take over?  Can the male become the home of the female?  I don't know.  I'm sure that all the people listening have a strong opinion, but as for the reality of it, I don't know.  I would tend towards no slash.  I'm a big proponent of agreed upon gender roles.  So if it works for the both of you, and let's get into the next comment because this is going to help me clarify.  All right, next up we have Jan Davidson.  Oh, my dog is pissed.  Woof, woof, woof, woof, woof.  We're all outside tilling.  We're creating a huge garden.  So we just bought a tiller and we're all out there kind of partying.  And she's pissed because she can't be out there because the gate's open.  All right, Shortage, I believe there's a male and female in each one of us, even the slightest.  I agree with what you say in the very powerful video.  Now, maybe it is a bit stereotypical because it applies that way without question to 100% masculine men and 100% feminine women.  What about the majority of human beings who often have a bit of the other gender characteristics?  So I've gotten into this conversation with friends and I haven't written about it to put it into my own words, but wow, I really think it needs mentioning because it's so true.  There are times when women are the strong ones that I'm going to use strong as like masculine.  Their power is grand or than a man's at a moment or at a thing.  And I think that's where the agreed upon gender roles comes in.  And then I also don't want to spit on the big five or the Myers-Briggs or just different personalities, different saturation of information.  Each one of you has had an education and the sponge of your... Sorry.  Your mind as a sponge has taken in all that the education has given it.  Some of you watch a lot of a certain type of content sponging in this type of information.  So we can't really... We can't disregard that.  Our history, were we abused when we were young?  Were we neglected?  Were we loved?  Were we rich?  Were we poor?  And that's where it goes back to what I was trying to say to Azerti the Azerto.  Wait, right?  There is agreed upon gender roles or just a natural inclination.  And there was a lot of comments where people were saying, I like to cook and my wife likes to tend the yard.  So that's kind of a reverse of what would be a stereotypical role.  But it works.  If it works for them, I'm not going to diss it.  I didn't really say anything, did I?  Oh, Jennifer, you never say shit.  Maybe, maybe not.  But I would just say it's different for everyone.  But there are gender roles for a reason.  Oh, okay.  Brad Highbart.  Thank you for the comment.  There's a shortage of women like you.  I have always said that if a woman treats her husband that makes him want to come home, divorce lawyers would go broke.  I work hard, come home, make dinner, bring it to her on the couch, do laundry, clean the house, and still no sex.  Needless to say, our marriage is on the rocks.  No, you cannot, because I'll tell you what she's doing.  You're freeing up her, you're giving her leisure time to think about how much you suck.  She does not, if she's listening, what are you doing?  Lady, what are you doing?  Why do you deserve this treatment?  And then to, what are you providing?  You're just taking from him.  They're making weird noises outside.  Yeah, Brad, stop.  And I'm going to move on to the next comment to kind of shore up my opinion on that.  I'm sorry, but that is not tolerable.  Chris Hadley says no, no shortage of meaningless competition in my doom marriage.  The shortage was the sex.  You two need to be friends and talk.  Pretty sure she was convinced that total domination was achievable through complete deprivation.  How is that winning for anyone?  So with nothing left to lose, but a lot of money, I left.  Freedom is priceless.  She wanted me to be completely ruled by her, ruled like her beta father by her mother.  Never.  13 years later, I'm still single.  Not happy about that.  But, but now, but now like dating now is all stupid games.  Join me or don't, but rule me.  You won't.  Chris Hadley.  Very good.  Um, I've said before that Dr.  Laura Schlesinger, she's, I'm pretty stuffed up.  Sorry.  She said there's three reasons to leave a marriage.  Addiction, affair, abuse.  And I'd like to add a fourth one.  Loosely, I haven't really thought about this a lot.  But the fourth one, I'm sure I could have it start with an A, but I can't right now, is... avoidance of sex, withholding of sex.  There are people that have commented that they haven't had sex in like a year and a half.  I know a woman who's married.  She and her husband haven't had sex in like five years.  Unless that's acceptable to both people, it's not acceptable.  Get out.  Get out.  I might edit here.  A fucking space marine.  Oh, shortage.  I'd like to find a real woman though.  I feel I don't meet your criteria of a real man.  Where do you lack?  I mean, if we're bullet pointing, have you not spent time cultivating yourself?  Are you weak?  Are you impatient?  Do you let emotions rule you?  Are you incapable?  Or do you let wrong penetrate your world?  I'd be interested to know the specific realm in which you think you lack.  So my question is, should I bother trying to date anyone to date anymore right now?  I mean, I'm still kind of hung up on my ex then.  No.  Or yes.  No.  I loved her more than anyone would have happily spent my life with her.  So I'm kind of in a rough spot.  Not really sure where to go from here.  You will.  You'll figure out where to go from here.  But I don't think it's dating.  If your emotional state is at a four right now and all of your energy is spent on another human and trying to reconcile that relationship or its demise, you don't have anything to give.  Not enough.  Not enough to get a woman that you would actually want.  Because eventually if you stay, if you meet somebody and she accepts you and you know at your root that you haven't given her everything, all of your energy, you're not going to respect her because she settled for a man who wasn't totally with her.  That's my opinion.  Everyone, I think that's it.  I'm going to go help till and lay some garden fabric.  I'm really pumped.  I have seeds going right now in the house.  Yeah, so that's it.  Thank you so much for tuning in.  I might go live to talk more about this.  I might not.  I'm just telling you what I'm thinking.  So at any rate... You know, it's funny because there's just so much overlap here, and there's so many friendships or mentorship that could happen within the comments section.  You know, like the person who is in a sexless marriage and does everything for his wife, and then the guy who left a wife basically for that reason and is happy.  Single and not loving that, but happy.  I'd rather have everyone be single than be with a fucking asshole partner.  Okay, everyone, enjoy your day.  You know what you should do today?  I know you're in quarantine, but you should go buy some seeds and like a little thing of dirt and then plant them in your house.  And when it gets nice out, you can have a little baby garden, just a little.  Okay, I'll see you soon.  If not tomorrow, next week.  All right, bye. ",
