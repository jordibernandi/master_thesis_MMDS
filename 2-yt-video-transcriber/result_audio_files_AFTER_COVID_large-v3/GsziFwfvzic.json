            "text": "Today at Maui Off-Road, we got this 2019 Ford F-250 Super Duty.  Awesome truck to begin with.  We put on a 6-inch Fabtech radius arm kit on here with the 4.0 Dirt Logic coilovers.  These things are pretty awesome.  With the 2.5 Dirt Logic rear shocks on this one.  We added on 37 13 1\u20442 Nitto Ridge Grappler tires with some Fuel 20x10.  This is the Rampage with the gray spoke.  It's got a good looking rim with the gray.  It kind of matches the color real nice.  Also on this one, really cool, we put on these AMP Research retractable running board steps.  These things are awesome.  They come with the LED lights in them as well.  Work with both front and rear doors.  Really nice upgrade to this truck being so high.  Helps you get in and out of the vehicle.  One thing the customer requested on this build, which is a little bit different, he wanted to add these BDS recoil style traction bars on here.  Real nice design, they have a spring loaded feature on there which allows for some flex.  so it's not too stiff in the rear.  Matches really nice, pretty much the same diameter as the Fabtech control arms in the front.  So not the same company, but they work well together, so it worked out really nice.  Plus.  it looks great too.  Other than that, it's just a really nice build on a Super Duty.  Not too tall, not too small.  It's just a really nice look.  Rides really nice.  A great performing vehicle.  If you have any questions or comments about this build or any other build, be sure to let us know.  We'll get back to you.  But thanks for watching. ",
