They are also sent by God to minister to the needs of the saints and all those who are heirs of the common salvation.  The Bible records that there are multitudes of angels in heaven.  According to Hebrews chapter 12 verse 22, the company of angels in heaven are innumerable.  However, we are not so familiar with their names. ",

            "text": "There's another protest which we should like to make ourselves in most of the references to angels, which I've seen lately.  It's very clear that the writers assume that they are the spirits of the dead returning to earth.  Now, according to the scripture, there's not one word of truth in any such conception.  Angels are created celestial beings, created by God.  They are not the disembodied spirits of human beings.  Psalms 8 verse 5, we're made a little lower than the angels.  We are not even the same order of beings.  They were brought into existence before men were created.  When Adam and Eve sinned and were driven from the garden, An angel at the gate prevented them from reentering this paradise home.  Read Genesis 3.24.  Angels were specially created.  They neither marry nor are given in marriage, according to Matthew 22.30.  So the angels of God were here before men were made, by God every single one of them, with the exception of the angels who failed and sinned with Lucifer.  God's holy angels love their creator and obey all his commandments.  You read that in Psalms 103 verse 20.  There are various orders of the angelic host.  Seraphim and cherubim are mentioned.  In Isaiah 6-2 and Psalms 80 verse 1.  Angels are here to help people, men and women, boys and girls. ",

We shall take a brief study of each of them and the functions they perform in accordance with the task in which they are divinely assigned.  Let's begin with Lucifer, the fallen angel.  Isaiah chapter 14 verse 12 made reference to Lucifer as one of the angels in heaven before his eventual fall as a result of his pride and conspiracy against the Most High. ",

How art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations?  For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven.  I will exalt my throne above the stars of God.  I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation in the sides of the north.  I will ascend above the heights of the clouds.  I will be like the Most High.  Lucifer was a beautiful creature in heaven.  We see this in the Bible.  a magnificent being.  The prophet Ezekiel described him as the seal of perfection, full of wisdom and perfect in beauty.  Every precious stone was his covering.  He was the anointed cherub who covers.  He was perfect in his ways from the day he was created.  Lucifer was fully arrayed by the Creator to reflect his glory.

            "text": "Now let's go on to Michael the Archangel.  Michael is known as God's Archangel, which means chief angel.  Scripture often refers to the Archangel Michael as a chief prince of the heavenlies.  Angel Michael is one of the archangels in heaven, which is associated with warfare, You may notice that most of the time when he is mentioned in scripture, one would notice that there is a battle to be fought.  Michael will hardly be mentioned when there is no warfare.  He is a spiritual warrior.  He specializes in fighting battles.  The Archangel Michael will play a major role in end time events.  As you would expect, we see in the last days of Daniel chapter 12 verse 1, \"...at that time Michael shall stand up, the great prince who stands watch over the sons of your  people.\".  Please notice the choice words of the Bible.  He watches over the sons of your people.  Not only is he the angel associated with warfare, but he is also a protector.  Furthermore, he might be the angel of 1 Thessalonians 4, verse 16, of whom Paul writes, \"...the Lord himself, with the cry of command, with the archangel's call, and with the sound of God's trumpet, will descend from heaven, and the dead in Christ will rise  first.\".  In Revelations 12, verses 7-9, we read how the angel Michael led the battle against the devil and the fallen angels, and they were sent out of heaven. ",

But pride sponsored his fall.  Angel Michael and his host waged war against Lucifer until there was no place for him in heaven.  Revelation 12 verse 7 and 8 relates the events of the war in heaven.  thus, And there was war in heaven.  Michael and his angels fought against the dragon, and the dragon fought his angels and prevailed not.  Neither was their place found any more in heaven.  Pride is that path that leads to destruction.

            "text": "Michael is notable for his great strength when it comes to fighting battles.  He defeated the devil and sent him out of heaven when iniquity was found in him.  Again, Michael fulfilled his wartime ministry when Daniel had prayed for 21 days, but the answer to his prayer was waylaid by the Prince of Persia.  The Prince of Persia warred against another angel, who was to bring the answers to the prayers of Daniel.  Due to the consistency of Daniel in the place of prayers, Michael had to intervene by rescuing the other angel from the hands of the Prince of Persia.  In Daniel chapter 10 verses 12 through 13, the angel finally came to Daniel and said, Fear not, Daniel, for from the first day that thou didst set thine heart to understand and to chasten thyself before thy God, thy words were heard, and I am come for thy words.  But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days.  But lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, and I remained there with the kings of Persia.  Michael defeated the prince and Persia, and also he rebuked the devil in the name of the Lord when he thrived for the body of Moses in Jude chapter 1 verse 9.  Michael is assigned by God to fight battles, and he has never lost one.  The fact that Michael is an archangel proves that there are orders and ranking among the angels.  For instance, it was not only Michael that fought the devil and his angels in Revelation chapter 12 verses 7 through 9, but he led other angels, showing that he is their commander-in-chief.  I would also like to highlight the fact that in Daniel chapter 10 verse 13, Michael is referred to as one of the chief princes, which suggests that in heaven there are more.  The Bible is silent about this though.  The angel Gabriel, If you've heard the Christmas story, chances are you recognize Gabriel as the name of the angel who brought Mary the news that she would become pregnant and give birth to Jesus.  Gabriel is one of only two named good angels in the Bible, the other one being Michael, who we have just discussed.  Gabriel is sometimes referred to as the Archangel Gabriel.  The Bible never gives him this title.  Michael is clearly referred to as an archangel in Jude, but Gabriel is not mentioned as such in the Holy Bible.  The major function assigned to the angel Gabriel is that of delivering good news to the people of God.  Angel Gabriel is also associated with good news.  He was sent to Zachariah the priest to deliver the message of the conception of John the Baptist, who was the forerunner of Jesus.  On a particular day, Zachariah went into the temple and we see in Luke chapter 1 verse 11, an angel of the Lord appeared to him standing at the right side of the altar of incense.  This angel was Gabriel.  Gabriel gave Zechariah the news that his wife Elizabeth would bear a son.  This news was strange to Zechariah.  as he said to the angel in verse 18, What proof is there for this?  I'm an old man and my wife is beyond her childbearing years.  In verse 19, the angel answered him, I'm Gabriel.  I stand in God's presence.  God sent me to tell you this good news.  And then continuing in verse 20, But because you didn't believe what I said, you will be unable to talk until the day this happens.  Everything will come true at the right time.  Also, Gabriel was sent to Mary, who became the mother of Jesus in Luke chapter 1 verses 28 through 31 with the following words, And the angel came in unto her and said, Hail, thou that art highly favored, the Lord is with thee.  Blessed art thou among women.  And behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name Jesus.  It was also Gabriel that appeared to Joseph, the fiance of Mary, in Luke chapter 1 verse 26, to appeal to him to not leave Mary, because her conception was of the Holy Spirit.  Because each time Gabriel appears in the Bible, he is giving good news to people, society has painted him to be a cute flowery little messenger boy that resembles Cupid.  This is completely incorrect.  When Gabriel appeared to Zechariah and Mary and Daniel, all three were stricken with awe and gripped with fear.  For Zechariah in Luke chapter 1 verse 12, when Zechariah saw him, he was troubled and fear fell upon him.  And Mary in Luke chapter 1 verse 29, when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying and considered what manner of greeting this was.  And then Daniel says in Daniel chapter 8 verse 17, So he came near where I stood, and when he came, I was afraid and fell on my face.  He had to reassure each of them before continuing with his messages.  So now let's move on to the last angel named in the Bible.  Most people don't even know he is in the Bible, let alone that he's described as an angel.  The angel most people have never heard of makes his appearance in the last book of the New Testament, the book of Revelation.  His name is Abaddon, or Apollyon.  Not very many Christians have heard about an angel called Abaddon.  They are majorly aware of Michael and Gabriel, probably because they appeared in several scriptural passages.  Abaddon is the same as Apollyon. ",

In Revelation 9 verse 11, Abaddon is not a location, but rather the king of the locusts.  Many commentators have identified Abaddon as Satan himself, but it is more likely that the angel of the bottomless pit is one of the prince's all powers under the devil.  Ephesians 6 verse 12.  For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.  He is most likely one of those entities described in Ephesians. ",
