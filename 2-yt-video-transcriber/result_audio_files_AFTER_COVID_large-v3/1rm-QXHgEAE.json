            "text": "Hi friends, Pastor Doug Batchelor.  You know, if you have been at all plugged into what's happening in the news and what's going on in the Capitol, you know that there's a great deal of unrest in the country right now.  And I think this is a time for God's people to just kind of come together.  Whatever our political preferences might be or ideologies, I think we need to come together and pray.  The country has become very polarized in this past year between the politics and the pandemic and the protests.  And God's called his children to be peacemakers.  And so, you know, I just thought it was really important for us to take some time.  And I would just like to sort of reach out and ask for believers in Jesus everywhere to come together and pray.  I'm taking some time to fast and pray today about what's happening.  We're told to pray for leadership in the country, even during the best of times.  But now we're having a very tempestuous transition of leadership.  And that's resulting in violence and discontent and whatever.  Wherever you might be coming from in your ideologies, I think it's important that we're able to set those things aside and remember that every believer is first and foremost a citizen of another kingdom.  We are ambassadors for Christ in this world and he's called us to pray.  And I think we should pray specifically that God works his will so that whatever the outcome, It lends towards the furtherance of the gospel, that freedom to preach is not restricted in any way, and that Christ can be glorified.  And, you know, I'd like to read a verse, and I think everyone knows this, in 2 Chronicles 7, verse 14.  If my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven.  I will forgive their sin and heal their land.  And right now, friends, we need some healing in the land.  So would you join me?  I'd like to offer a brief prayer and then invite everybody to spend more time praying after the end of this little video.  Father in heaven, we come before you right now in Jesus' name, and we're lifting up our country.  Lord, we pray for forgiveness for our sins and our pride.  Sometimes we've taken the blessings and the plenty for granted, and we just have forgotten to seek first your kingdom.  I pray that you will heal hearts, Lord, that will result in healing of relationships and healing the land, that your spirit right now will just settle down on the whole country.  and people will start realizing that these neighbors that we're fighting against, that we are neighbors.  And that many people around the world look to the United States to be a champion for freedom and for helping to circulate peace in the world.  And so, Lord, I just pray that your spirit will come down and just bless your church so that at a time like this, we might hold up Christ and that we might represent Jesus and his principles.  Please bless, Lord.  We pray that you'll forgive.  We pray that you'll heal and bring revival upon your church.  We pray that you be with the leaders, Lord, of the country.  and that your spirit will speak to their hearts, and that you'll just bring calm right now.  We thank you.  We pray these things in Jesus' name.  Amen.  Thank you, friends, and God bless. ",
