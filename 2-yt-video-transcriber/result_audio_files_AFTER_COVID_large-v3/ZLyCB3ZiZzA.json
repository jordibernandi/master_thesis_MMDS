            "text": "The economy continues to fall apart as GDP contracts.  Deflation continues to accelerate as velocity slows.  And a few weeks ago, I did a story on unemployment, and I said that the official numbers were far too low, that unemployment was actually much higher than that.  I said it was at least 10% to 15% higher.  Well, I was wrong.  It's far, far worse than that.  This first story here, survey finds 50 million Americans have lost their jobs in the past six weeks.  Well, the official numbers are 30 million Americans losing their jobs in the past six weeks alone.  However, that may be understating the full number of Americans who have lost their jobs by as much as 50%.  I said 10 to 15.  This survey is showing 50%.  The poll found that for every 10 people who have successfully filed unemployment claims, Three or four people have been unable to register.  Now this is due to technical issues and staffs at the unemployment office that are just completely overwhelmed.  And another two people have not tried to apply.  They haven't even tried.  And so that's three or four people plus two.  So you're talking five or six people.  So this number isn't 10, it's 15 or 16.  That's 50 or 60% higher than what the official numbers are.  Now, this graph that's in this story is the official numbers.  And this is the estimate for this week.  The data should be out tomorrow.  And what it's showing here, if you add all of these up, you've got 26.5 million.  And this is 3.5, so that brings you to an even 30 million.  But those are only the people that were actually able to file and get accepted for an unemployment claim.  And like I said, there's a whole bunch of people that just aren't eligible.  And this says, however, EPI's survey indicates that an additional, this is in addition to all of this, 8.9 million to 13.9 million people have been shut out of the system.  So they are not eligible to even go and file and receive benefits.  Moving on to our main page at GoldSilver, I'm going to do a poll here, and I'd like to know if you're using goldsilver.com as your news page.  So tell us if you are or if you aren't.  You know, this was the story that you just saw.  And my friend, one of my best friends, and we've known each other for more than 50 years.  I mean, we met when we were in seventh grade.  And he works tirelessly, literally day and night, to scour the world to find you news stories that very often mainstream media will either neglect to cover or they will actually suppress.  And he has problems sleeping at night, so he'll be up from 1 until 3, finding out what has happened in Europe and Asia, while we were sleeping and then, you know, the rest of the day he's posting these news stories.  So we just want to know, is this really something of benefit to you?  Because I think the stuff that he posts, many of these stories, have an impact on your life and it's good to know these things in advance.  on the radar.  Jim Rickards says a new survey shows that of those who received the IRS stimulus checks, 38% added to savings.  That's deflationary because it slows the velocity of currency.  That currency is going to sit there.  It's not going to change hands in transactions and cause economic activity and causing prices to rise.  It sits there parked and that's deflationary and causes prices to fall.  26% paid off debt.  That's very deflationary because debt creates currency.  And when you extinguish debt, when you pay it off, that currency vanishes in our modern economy.  So this actually shrinks the currency supply.  And 18% planned to spend, but not yet.  Deflationary.  So this is all deflation.  As I warned, there is no stimulus in the stimulus.  This is the classic liquidity trap.  And if you looked at that picture, This is Wall Street.  This is the New York Stock Exchange.  It's empty.  There is nobody there except this one guy in a mask.  This is The Moon, and he tweets that breaking news, at least a dozen Lebanese banks across the country, and he's talking about in Lebanon here, have been torched and vandalized in the past 48 hours.  Citizens are upset about the Lebanese pound falling 50% in value over the past six months.  Now, the Lebanese pound is pegged, and it doesn't fluctuate up and down.  It just stays the same, but that's the official pound.  What he's talking about here, this is the black market value, the black market exchange rate, which says right now pressure is building up, and what's going to happen is is there will be an official break.  Maybe they peg at a different rate again, or maybe they just lose the peg and allow the market to determine this.  If the market determines it, this fall would have taken place very slowly over six months and everything would be fine.  But when this breaks, there's going to be total chaos.  This happened to the Thai bot in 1997.  The Thai bot was pegged to the US dollar and to do that, the Taiwanese central bank had to be able to buy or sell dollars in unlimited quantities.  and they had been selling dollars and they were almost out of them.  And when they started to run out, they had to abandon the peg and let the Thai bot float.  And what happened was this huge convulsion that caused something called the Asian contagion.  All of the tiger economies, the Asian tiger economies, that was the day the tiger died.  There were riots that broke out all across Asia.  There were people that died, that got killed in these riots.  That spread to even to Russia only.  where we then had the russian bond default in nineteen ninety eight.  and that caused the meltdown of long-term capital management which was a hedge fund that had bets all over the world in this upset their bets and uh... it caused a meltdown of this hedge fund that was very highly leveraged And it almost caused the entire global financial system to freeze up and shut down.  Alan Greenspan had to arrange an emergency meeting and they were up all night long trying to figure out how they were going to solve this and keep the entire global economy from failing.  And he was successful by getting some of the world's largest banks to buy up this hedge fund and slowly unwind their positions.  So what is happening right now in Lebanon has something to do with all of the countries that surround it.  There's going to be when this peg, because, you know, it's just a government peg.  And when you try to manipulate something, when a central bank is trying to force something, the market eventually overwhelms that.  Another thing that's on the radar, Scotiabank closes its metals business.  Scotia was for years the world's largest lender to the physical precious metals industry, a history that stretches to 1684.  And so they are closing this division.  Scotia was for years the world's biggest lender to the physical precious metals industry with a history stretching to the founding in 1684 of London gold dealer Makata Bullion, which Scotia Bank bought.  and they became Scotia Makata for a while.  They call themselves Scotia Bank again.  But what's happening here is, my guess is, that there's something coming.  Physical delivery is getting very, very difficult.  Real gold and silver is becoming hard to find.  And the thing is, if you look at what's happening on the commodities exchange, There is about nine contracts for each ounce of real gold and silver that is deliverable, that's in the registered category, deliverable at these prices.  So there's basically nine owners per ounce.  It's a game of musical chairs.  There's one chair, there's nine people dancing, and Scotia believes that the music is about to stop.

I just want people to have this knowledge.  that's in that book.  The chart of the day.  This is GDP expansion or contraction.  And this is actually horrific because this is measured in quarters.  Each year down here, there's four bars per year.  And what we've had is a contraction of 4.8%.  However, this is for the entire quarter, and we were expanding in January and February and the first half of March.  It was basically the economy in the United States got shut off in the final week of March.  There are 13 weeks in a quarter, so this measurement is one... Whatever the gains were in January, February, and the first few weeks in March were offset by this much in the final week of March.  That means that the next quarter is going to be horrific.  This quarter is going to look like this one, and the next one is going to be way, way off the bottom of this chart.  It'll probably be the largest contraction in the shortest period of time in history.  Because, even during the Great Depression, it took from the crash of 1929 until the stock market bottomed in 1932 for the full contraction to bring the economy from a bubble into the Great Depression.  This is happening in just... a few months.  This contraction here, as I said, it's 1 13th of the quarter that caused this.  The next one is going to be huge.  And then it takes the federal, they haven't declared an official recession yet, even though we know, everybody knows we are in a recession.  It started a while ago, and this recession is probably going to turn into a depression.  This contraction is going to take two consecutive quarters of economic contraction and then about a month to compile the data and release it.  And so you won't know until August that a recession actually started in March.  Viewer feedback.  This is from yesterday's video, and Jeff Durden says, iPencil was great and showed why most Soviet, which is in reality the best planned economy ever, products were just plain sucked.  And they did.  I used to manufacture high-end audio stuff, and I found a loudspeaker manufacturer that made woofers and tweeters and mid-ranges, and you couldn't get two from them that were remotely identical, so you couldn't design a crossover network that would make this thing work.  Every speaker would have had to be individually engineered.  It was just awful stuff.  They made bad cars, and this was the most scientifically planned economy ever.  Please go and watch Pandora's Box, a BBC series from a few decades ago.  that was absolutely wonderful.  And the very first episode is about the scientific engineering of the Soviet economy.  And I didn't even know.  I watched it a second time, and I had forgotten.  that the leaders of the Soviet Union coming out of World War II, Nikita Khrushchev, Leonid Brezhnev, and Boris Yeltsin, were all some of the top engineers and economists that had been running the economy, and they ended up running the entire country.  It would be like us having Alan Greenspan, Ben Bernanke, Janet Yellen and Jerome Powell as our past presidents and still their economy failed.  You know, I want to relate the quote of today today to yesterday's quote of the day where I was talking about how free market transactions, whenever somebody does a free market transactions, both parties benefit and the prosperity is raised for both parties.  Today, this one links to that.  Underlying most arguments against the free market is a lack of belief in freedom itself.  And this is so true because the free market, which is the source of all prosperity, you know, in every video, there's people that comment, yeah, but the free market this, the free market that, and they've got some better idea than the free market.  And there is.  no system that has ever been designed that brings us more prosperity than the free market because it's simply being allowed, you and me, being allowed, you want to sell me something?  I want to open up my wallet and buy it?  That's okay.  That is a free market transaction.  When the government says, oh, no, no, no, we need our cut.  The price is going up because we're going to tax that thing by this amount, this amount, this amount.  We're going to tax it to death.  Or they say, oh, you can't do that.  That's illegal.  Or they say, well, we've reached our quota.  Or they say, you're not charging a high enough price.  Or you're charging too high a price.  You cannot charge that price.  This is going to be the price.  It prevents those transactions from happening.  And there is no way to manipulate a market.  There's no alternative to a free market that doesn't limit your freedom.  I want to thank you for watching.  We'll see you next time. ",
