            "text": "Tacitus tells us that the German tribes kept sacred white horses in the groves and woods of the gods, and that from their neighings and snortings, auguries were taken.  Amongst the people of the northern marshlands, the white horse seems to have been held in a special honour, and to this day, a white horse rampant forms the cognizance of Hanover and Brunswick.  The English settlers brought this, their national emblem, with them to Britain, and cut its figure on the chalk downs as they advanced westward to mark the progress of their conquest.  The white horses on the Berkshire and Wiltshire hills still bear witness to their settlement.  England is a country of gentle gradients, slow moving rivers, long and well-drained valleys.  We tend to picture the old England as an emptier, cleaner version of our own rural England, but it was not.  Its aspect was quite different.  Like most of Wales and Scotland, it was a jungle, if one may use the word in a temperate zone context, in which settlement, although not new, had not yet taken very well.  By the time the Teutonic tribes arrived in the 5th century, the light network of Roman civilization which had been laid across this wilderness had by now fallen apart and was decaying.  The towns were long deserted, the roads beginning to be overgrown.  The achievement of the English in cultivating the face of Britain during the first five centuries of their settlement was much greater than that of all the people who came before them.  When they arrived, for example, the whole of the Midlands was still continuous primeval forest.  The river valleys in those areas were deserted until the English cleared and cultivated the heavy soils of the lowland valleys.  We're left to conclude that it was Anglo energy, Anglo will, which drove them to tackle the job of felling forests and claiming difficult soils for cultivation.  At least 98 of every 100 acres of land, which is now either farmland or is built on, was still in the state of nature in the 5th century.  The forests of Selwood, Wychwood, Savenake, Wyre, Arden, Sherwood, Epping, Kinver, Morph and the Chilterns were dark, continuous woodlands, vastly more extensive than they are now, and in which the voice of man had scarcely been heard since the time of the Mesolithic hunters.  From Kent to Hampshire, the Weald was unbroken forest.  In Sussex, Somerset and Lincolnshire, and neighbouring counties, there were enormous expanses of marsh and fen, huge populations of wildfowl and wading birds.  The Scottish and Welsh islands were virtually untouched.  We with our motorsaws, tractors, harvesters and machinery, can have very little idea of the slowness and pace upon our ancestors in carving out this great nation, where houses, streets, ",
