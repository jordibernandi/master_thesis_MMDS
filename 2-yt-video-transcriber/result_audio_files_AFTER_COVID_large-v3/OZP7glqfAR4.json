What's truth, right?  And I'm looking forward to having Ariana on my show soon.  But honestly, that was pretty blatant.  That was literally like the state-controlled media being like, yank, yoink.  It wasn't even like a physical, yeah.  Let me say this.  Go back to your original point, though.  In terms of the infiltrators, right?  Yeah.  We're seeing infiltration at a lot of different levels.  Bezos' money is infiltration.  That's just bottom line.  Bloomberg's money is infiltration in the Sierra Club, right?  You know, Eric Schmidt's money is infiltration. ",

You've got to get that money again.  You've got to get it back.  So you're going to talk to the people who are doing that stuff, like who are giving you the money.  You're going to find out what they like, right?  Instead of staffing up, what they need to be doing is paying grassroots organizers in the streets.  The only good thing that these environmental organizations could do possibly would be to regrant this money, to regrant it, to identify.  And they know who they are.  They know who they are.  They know who they are because they're the same members, right?  All the mom and pop environmental organizations are members of Sierra Club.  Well, Sierra Club didn't get the money, which is interesting because Sierra Club actually does do some of this, but they took Bloomberg's money.  Right.  So the best thing that these environmental organizations could do, instead of hiring 50 more lawyers from Harvard, which is always what they do. ",
