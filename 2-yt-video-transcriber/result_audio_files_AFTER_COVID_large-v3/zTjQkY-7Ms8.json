Redwood City resident Dan Peace got permission from city officials to paint Black Lives Matter sign on Broadway as part of the Fourth of July public art celebration.  The city even supplied him with yellow poster board paint to do it.  Well, they're paying for it, too.  Well, now you got to pay for my paint to write my message.  Because we were using the poster board paint that would eventually deteriorate over time, my understanding from them was that the mural would last as long as the paint lasted.
