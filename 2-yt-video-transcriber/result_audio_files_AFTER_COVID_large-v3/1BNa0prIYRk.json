My hands are right here.  I know my rights and I know the law.  You can't tell me nothing.  I just walked out of the house.  My husband just walked out of the house.  Call your supervisor.  I'm not doing shit.  Yep, you're gonna be done right now!  What is there to explain about me, sir?  I walked out of my house, sir.  I walked out of my house.  You see your top lights there?  Listen to me, answer me.  You see your top lights?  I walked out of the house.  Soon as I walked out of my house with my phone in my hand playing a poker game and watching TV, his lights were on.  He turned his lights off and called me, what's in my hands?  None of your business.  what's in my hands.  What the fuck, are you crazy?  I'm not doing nothing.  I know my rights.

I'm not.  You have no suspicion of me committing a crime.  No, you don't.  This way?  Isn't that my vehicle?  We just got this vehicle.  Oh, it's fired.  Uh, we were in the house that was cooking.  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  I was in the house.  I was in the house.  They just went and did laundry and came back.  And I just walked out of my house.  So how are shots fired?  I don't even own a gun.  I don't own a gun.  That's why we're checking on you.  Yeah, but you're checking on somebody that was in the house minding their business.  I wasn't in the car.  So if I wasn't in the car... No, I did not.  You're a liar.  And it's on camera.  So I hope your camera's a roof.  Because when you pulled up, I was in the house, watching TV, playing poker.  So you're a liar.  Yes, you are.  I got two witnesses here.  Someone is out there shooting and you're busy over here!  You were already out here when I got here with your top lights on and all the white lights, just like this is.  And then I came out, I see you, you turned them off, and then you told me to put my hands in the air.  No!  You said you're lying. ",
