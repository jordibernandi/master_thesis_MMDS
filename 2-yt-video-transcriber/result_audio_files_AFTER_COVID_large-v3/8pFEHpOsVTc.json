            "text": "Hey everyone!  I decided today that I wanted to do, in addition to the video essays, which I absolutely love doing, I also just wanted to come and just talk about topics that have really been on my mind, especially how they relate to Black women, the media, and entertainment.  So a long, long time ago, I made a video called Fuck Sleepy Hollow, which was in response to the treatment that actress Nicole Beharie got from the show and her being killed off from a series that she was supposed to be the series lead in.  Like, one of the moments that I remember so clearly as being a reminder that there is no safety in entertainment media for black leads.  Because not only was she the series lead and had all of this build up to be this, you know, equal par with Tom Mice's character.  when push came to shove she was just pushed out of the narrative and removed almost entirely for like Katrina and then they had the audacity to kill her off and have them go.  oh you know your story is really about Ichabod.  you were here to help the white man the whole time.  I don't understand what is there for me in a world without you.  Our job was to carry you forward.  My job was done.  My wife.  Still my beating heart.  And this came after a first season that had amazing diversity with Orlando Jones, with Amandla Steinberg as the daughter, the character of Jenny, who was Abby's sister, who was also a black woman.  So we had all of these brown skin people just thriving and doing well.  and then season two happened, and then that's when the bullshit started.  And when the bullshit started, we all were smelling it.  While there was a loud and obnoxious Katrina Stan center, I felt like critics who had been interested in the show really understood that Bahari was a... untapped resource.  They knew that she was part of the appeal and they could tell that she was being pushed out.  I remember listening to After Buzz shows that I never thought were very good at understanding the gender discourses in fandom who saw what was happening to Abby and were like.  And so after she died, you never really saw Nicole Beharie that much.  She popped up just recently in Black Mirror, in Little Fires Everywhere, and most recently she was starred as Turquoise Jones in Miss Juneteenth.  Now Miss Juneteenth is amazing.  if you haven't seen it go check it out.  it's really fun.  nicole bahari is just excellent actress and i think that it's just.  it's refreshing to see a black american movie that is so proud of its roots and touches on all these different kind of layers of black southern identity.  it's so great.  highly recommend go check it out.  During the press tour for Miss Juneteenth, Nicole Beharie had an interview with the New York Times with Candace Frederick, who is amazing on Twitter.  Please follow her.  She does amazing journalism.  She's great.  I always think of her as a resource.  And she was talking about what happened to her during Sleepy Hollow.  She says, for me, six years ago, I was on a TV show.  My co-star and I both got sick at the same time with the same illness and had different treatments.  He was allowed to go on leave for a month and I had to continue working.  There was a smoke screen of me getting my own episode titled Mama.  By the end of that episode, I started to fall apart.  Now, just to go back, Mama was an episode that we were all hype about, those who love Sleepy Hollow and loved Abby, because finally it was gonna be an Abby-centric episode that touched on her trauma And I can understand how as an actress, you're taught to work through things.  I remember Ichabod being sick and Tom Mizen being sick on the show and him getting put to the side.  And considering they had been sidestepping Abby all this time, I find it absurd that when she's finally sick, they're like, but we finally have an episode for you, sis.  Don't you think that you should just show up for us?  Like... Fuck Slippy Hollow.  They shut down production for two weeks because I got sick.  They sent in lots of doctors and I had daily checkups to make sure I was actually sick because they had to get production going.  Every doctor said I wasn't doing well, that I needed to rest.  That is not what they wanted to hear.  So months and months go through, she ends up getting an autoimmune condition and had to be on eight different prescription medications.  And the company was terrible to her and blamed her for this and labeled her as difficult.  A lot of corporations are saying lovely things right now, but it doesn't always go well when black people speak up and ask questions.  We can face weaponized denial and obliviousness.  Sometimes I think that some people I was working with didn't like that.  I was unwell, but loved by the audience.  I would think they'd support that, but eventually everyone of color on that show was seen as expendable and eventually I was let go.  And then as you try to get work otherwise, people were saying like, we heard that you were unprofessional, that you were difficult, that you were negative.  She was sick, she was sick, she had an autoimmune disease because she couldn't get time off of work, and she's an actress, a lead actress, and you don't have the time for this?  I mean, shows are used to dealing with pregnancies when they have female leads, and yet this show that had pulled in so much appeal because of the blackness that was being promoted on this series and their black lead gets sick and she can't get sick time.  She can't have space to heal.  They can't find a way to make it move.  They already decided to sideline her and make all these Katrina-centric episodes.  They could have found some way to either, you know, have a young, you know, some young Abby stuff happening.  There are so many things that they do in production when you're in League at Six.  I mean, when Lucy Lawless got injured on Xena and they had the actress who plays Callisto play Xena for like three episodes.  This is a supernatural show.  It is built around the ability and the flexibility to have your lead character be in all kinds of weird body switching, swapping situations.  There is no excuse and it is simply because as she said, she was seen as expendable.  That was their mistake because the show went to shit after she left because we told you that we were here for Abby and you played yourself.  And I always wanted to do a thing about this, but it kept getting out of my hands, so I didn't get a chance to do it.  And then what kind of made me decide to come back and do it?  were the two Vulture articles.  E. Alex Jung had two articles come out, and it was this Tandy Newton one and Michaela Cole interviews.  These two interviews, they're fantastic.  Everything will be linked down below.  I highly recommend to check them out because they are so thoroughly Mwah, amazing interview, amazing subjects.  Both of these women are fantastic.  I May Destroy You is so hard to watch, but it's so gratifying at the same time.  Mikayla Cole is a genius, like genius, and she is making some amazing television, but we should've done that, because Chewing Gum was also the shit.  I'm gonna go to Mikaela's article first and just compare it to Dandy, because that'll kind of bring us back to Nicole's situation.  So, Mikaela Cole was pitching I May Destroy You to Netflix back in 2017, according to this interview, and they offered her $1 million for the title, which sounds amazing, right?  But then, But then they said that they wanted to have all copyright for this.  So she would not retain any rights to the show.  Now what's important to understand about I May Destroy You is that it is based on her own rape and sexual assault trauma.  And so this story was her transforming her pain and her trauma into a narrative, into art.  This is her life.  This is her story.  This is her pain that she has, you know, that she cultivated into art and they wanted to own it.  And can you just imagine for a moment that you create something to give autonomy back to yourself and a corporation wants to take that same autonomy from you from that work.  This is why capitalism is a piece of shit, guys, because this is madness.  On top of that, she claims in this article that her agency wanted to push her to get this deal because they were gonna get something on the back end.  Girl, she dodged a bullet.  She went to the BBC and they gave her everything she wanted.  And that sort of confidence, that sort of ability to speak up for yourself is so like, to have people to believe that strongly in you is so rare as a woman and as a black woman, to have that kind of clout and to have people see your work and recognize your genius so much that you are able to be like, no, I'm not taking a million dollars, because that million dollars is all I'm gonna get out of my creative project.  She wrote every episode.  She co-directs the majority of the series.  And they did not want her to have copyright over her own creation.  And then the layers of that, especially when you think about, you know, the black experience or the diaspora of people trying to, like, use our trauma, use our experiences to take it, market it, and then cut us out of it.  And she said, no.  Oh, my God, that I lived for it.  It was so important.  But that's why the Thaddeus Newton article was such a great follow up, because it was a reminder that Thaddeus Newton, who is a the only black woman to win a BAFTA period um for a terrible movie for Crash my god my dog um that her with all of the clout that she has that you think that she would have there is still this inability for Hollywood to treat her like a person.  So in her piece, she talks about being groomed throughout, you know, her early parts of her career and having people labeled the grooming and the assault that she was, you know, dealing with as an affair, even though she was 16 years old, she was a child, and yet, she gets that kind of reputation.  That's kind of how it's framed because she is this, you know, mixed race but visibly black woman.  And it's easy for them to exotify her and put her in these roles that are purposefully to send certain images.  Talks about like being darkened for certain roles and then lightened for others.  For example, she plays Sally Hemings in this terrible Thomas Jefferson's Sally Hemings romance film and they wanted her to be a little bit lighter for that because there were no African Americans, no black Americans working on these stories and therefore they were trying to capitalize on her vibe.  The same way they did with Halle Berry during her career.  They are very parallel in that way.  And one of the things that she brings up in this story, which has been circulating all over the place, is the incident with Charlie's Angels.  According to her, and Amy Pascal has denied this because Amy Pascal is the one who's being called out in this, she was supposed to be the Lucy Liu character in the Charlie's Angels 2000 film.  And she goes into the studio and the woman's, Amy Pascal says, look, I don't mean to be politically incorrect, but the character as written and you playing the role, I just feel we gotta make it believable.  Believable, okay.  Well, you know, the character is written, she's been to university and educated.  Danae Newton went to Cambridge.  She went to the Cambridge school, I think it's Downing, that's known for law and medicine.  She has a degree from Cambridge.  Maybe there could be a scene where you're in a bar and she gets up on the table and starts shaking her booty.  She turned down that movie.  And I think about that because that movie was huge.  I mean, that Charlie and the Angels movie is problematic, but it be hitting sometimes.  And that role is part of what exposed me to Lucy Liu when I was a kid, because I saw her as an angel in theaters with my mother.  Like, we saw that together because we like to see girls cooking butt.  Because she turned on that role, because it was stereotyping, and because of the hypersexuality of the film, She lost a huge opportunity.  I mean, Denny Newton is known, but people mostly know her now from Westworld.  There is power in being in a super successful show.  And so she lost out on the ability to be in a mainstream movie that had a sequel that was very successful and have her name be on the lips of different people.  And those are the sacrifices that black actresses are forced to make in order to have some kind of integrity in this industry.  And if you look at these three stories, you see three women who are brilliant, who are strong, who are, you know, across the shade range.  But all three of them have to deal with being belittled and marginalized in their experiences.  Like, Mikayla Cole did get that deal that she wanted, but the gamble that she took to get there.  It is important to remember that as we celebrate, you know, black actresses getting their due, how they have come to get there.  How some of these other skinned actresses who are, who love being black, who are secure in their blackness still will get weaponized.  How you can be the lead of a series and be sick and you were still going to get penalized for it.  These are the things that when I talk about the treatment of these black actors on these shows, this is why.  Because you have no idea the lack of support that they could be getting from the higher ups down.  We are celebrating the fact that the new Batwoman character is cast as this beautiful, beautiful black bisexual woman.  That's amazing news.  Will she have support?  Will there be hairdressers in there who know how to use black hair?  Will there be black makeup artists?  Will there be people who are prepared to have her succeed at this job besides getting up on stage?  Will there be support from beginning to end?  The description of the character is already very messy.  It's very, very messy.  But the reason I wanted to talk about this and bring it back to the... The reason why I want to talk about this and bring it back to Nicole Beharie's situation is that Nicole Beharie is so talented, so talented.  Beautiful, trained actress.  And her career was stalled for years because of a Fox show that did not know how to tap into her as a resource that used her, propagated her, you know, monetized her, monetized the excitement that we had of having a black lead and then kicked her to the curb the moment she got sick.  This happens so often.  You saw it with Gabrielle Union.  You saw it even with Orlando Jones.  And you see how certain people want to come and pretend they don't know what we're talking about.  These issues are always all connected.  They are always attached to each other.  And while it may be difficult to deal with the fact that, yes, it is uncomfortable to realize that it isn't just about getting to be on screen.  It's about the treatment of these people.  And Sleepy Hollow actively knew that they had a strong audience of black people who loved her and they punished her for it.  When I hear conversations about shows that went off the deep end, when I hear conversations about shows that completely shit the bed, when they could have been being excellent, the number one show I hear people say, among many, is fucking Sleepy Hollow.  And then they replaced her with another woman of color.  And I tell you this, when we talk about solidarity, when you saw that she got fired and you took that role, that was bullshit.  I cannot imagine.  Like, you know, I think it's Sofia Vergara.  Sofia Vergara is like currently hosting America's Got Talent.  I can't believe she's there.  Why are you there?  You know why Gabrielle Union isn't there anymore and yet you're still there.  Why?  You are so rich.  You do not need to be on this show.  That is the lack of solidarity that we talk about from non-black people with us.  Because when you see that this is what's happening and you know that this is some shady shit, because I feel like as women, when we hear an actress being labeled as difficult, we know what the fuck that shit means.  We know half the time it doesn't mean that they're actually a bad person.  It means that they were too assertive, they were sick, they had needs, and they were vocal about it.  Especially when you know that's a black woman who has spoken up about inequality.  Fuck Sleepy Hollow.  Today, tomorrow, forever.  Goodbye.  Thank you. ",
