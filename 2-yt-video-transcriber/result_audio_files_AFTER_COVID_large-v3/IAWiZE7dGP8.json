You know, the market was priced for perfection, and clearly we're not going to get that.  But the larger economic issue is not the coronavirus itself.  If the U.S.  economy were fundamentally healthy, this virus wouldn't make it sick.  The problem is the Federal Reserve has kept interest rates so low for so long to artificially stimulate the economy that it has inflated a gigantic bubble.  And the coronavirus may be the pin, but the problem is not the pin, but the bubble that the pin pricks. ",

Look, everything the Fed has done since the 2008 financial crisis has only exacerbated the problems that created that crisis, which is why we're on the precipice of a much larger one and why the pricking of this bubble is so risky.  And if the Fed, of course, goes back to the drawing board, and it just cuts rates again.  All it's doing is throwing gasoline on the fire that it lit. ",
