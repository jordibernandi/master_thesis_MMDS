            "text": "Welcome back to Conspiracy Cats.  Now, in my time on YouTube, I've obviously had the opportunity to speak one-on-one with flat earthers and other science deniers, and they have never, ever failed to impress me with the sheer lengths they will go to to avoid any sort of scientific education whatsoever.  Like the time I spoke to Nathan Thompson, the leader of the biggest flat earth group on Facebook, and he couldn't use simple high school trigonometry to figure out the length of a side of a triangle because the lengths were given to him in kilometers and not miles.  How would you calculate it, Nathan?  I mean, so your argument is that the north, you know, I personally can't calculate that.  I don't work in kilometers.  I normally work in miles.  And then there was my first debate ever against FlatOutHero, who literally stunned me into silence when I explained to him how the angle of Polaris in the sky matching our latitude is proof that the Earth is a sphere.  Now, to aid me in my explanation, I used the idea of a tangent line on a circle.  The only problem was he didn't know what a tangent line was.  Now, only if that tangent line... Well, it's a tangent line.  Will we be able... And then, of course, was my debate against Kent Hovind, who seemed to only have one response to any question I gave him.  I'm not prepared for that.  But all of that pales into complete insignificance when compared to a conversation I had recently on MC Toon's channel against a flat earther on the subject of refraction.  Now, I've linked MC Toon's channel and the debate in the description, and I highly recommend you go and watch it.  It is pretty unique.  But before that, for anybody who's new to my channel or wants to know why we were discussing refraction with a flat earther, here's a quick catch-up.  Many centuries ago, people believed the Earth was flat.  But then they learned some stuff and realized it wasn't.  But some people held on to that belief.  They realized that if they chose not to learn anything, they could still pretend the Earth is flat and make people give them money on YouTube.  I'll take every bit of it.  But out of this band of misfits rose a champion.  A brave man who was prepared to say, I will prove the shape of the Earth.  And so he did.  His name was Ranty Flat Earth.  Ranty Flat Earth proved the shape of the world by filming a boat sailing over the horizon.  But the rest of the Flat Earthers were angry.  And in an attempt to explain his observations away, made up some spectacular shit about things disappearing from the bottom up as they moved further away.  But ranty Flat Earth is a resilient man, and some might say, even a hero.  I'm a stupid Flat Earther, and I want to know where these mountains have gone.  He shoved these claims back up their left nostril using an egg and a plastic buddha, showing that on a flat racetrack, distance does indeed not, sir, make things disappear from the bottom up.  With Flat Earth all but dead and buried, they needed a hero of their own.  Somebody to step forward and take making up spectacular shit to the next level.  Flat Earth Millionaire put out the call on his spirit level mobile phone, but just one man answered.  So please welcome YouTube's very own The Plain Truth and his spectacularly made up Etherband.  Yeah, so it seems that our friend, who goes by the name of The Plain Truth on YouTube, claims to be able to explain why things like the boats and wind turbines you see in these pictures vanish from the bottom up when they go into the distance.  And he is absolutely adamant it's got absolutely nothing to do with Earth curvature.  Well, we'll just see about that.  But first of all, the conversation started off politely enough with MC Toon showing us that we can use trigonometry and geometry in the real world to make calculations about things that are correct.  So therefore, when geometry and trigonometry tell us that the earth can't be flat, flat earthers should listen.  Using nothing but geometry now, we can know how tall that is.  So I calculated it.  If you go to the next one there, 9.8 feet tall is what I calculated, just using math.  And then Gleam, arguing on the flat earth side, actually brought a peer reviewed scientific paper to try and cast into doubt how much we can trust photographic evidence when judging drop in the distance due to curvature.  With this, this is an additional thing that you need to be adding on to your geometry, which I do not understand why you don't account for this to try and shut flat earthers down on their own terms.  And at this point, I'm just going to take a quick 10 seconds to explain Gleam's argument as I understood it.  Sometimes we can calculate the height of an object in the background of a picture by counting the number of pixels that it takes up.  But two of these three photographs have been subjected to what we call perspective distortion.  And if we applied that method to the purple bottle in the background, we will get a different height from each of these photographs.  But the facts are to get the effects that we see in these photographs here is something that has to be aimed for deliberately.  The top photograph requires a wide angle lens and the bottom photograph requires a telescopic lens.  And it's also important to note that neither of these effects can ever explain the vanishing of objects in the background from the bottom up.  So after what was a very informative first half of the debate, up steps our friend who is from this point forward ever to be known as the worst flat earth debater in the history of time.  So conspiracy cats.  Wow.  Look, number one, you know it freaks me out when you do that.  And number two, you are just going to have to live with it.  This guy is even worse at debating flat earth than you are.  It's just the way it is.  Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the worst flat earth debater on YouTube.  or anywhere.  So to begin our debate, The Plain Truth opened up with a 10 minute video he made on refraction.  Now, I think we all know that when I edit videos, I edit them to make them look a little bit sillier than they really are.  But not in this case.  The link is in the description and what you're about to see are the best bits of the most incoherent waffle I think I've ever heard in my entire life.  Enjoy.  What is creating the horizon?  Double vision.  Think about that, please.  The sky can be miraged.  What does that mean?  What does that mean?  Hot air rises.  I thought the dense air was at the bottom, the hot air was above, but these layers are mixing now?  So that's interesting.  Blah.  Blah.  Blah.  A negative and a positive cancel each other out.  This has no meaning.  Boats are always obstructed 100% by the effects of the aether band.  Everybody drink.  Wow.  And they were the best bits.  Amazing.  It certainly is.  Now, he seems to be making the claim that mirages exist, which nobody doubts, but he's also making the claim that something called the ether band exists, which everybody doubts, and that somehow mirages and the ether band give rise to the effect of boats vanishing from the bottom up, making us believe that they're going over Earth curve when they're actually not.  Now, I hear you ask, what is the ether band and how does it work?  But unfortunately, in the half hour I was given, I wasn't able to extract that information out of him because he was too busy embarrassing himself by shouting over everybody and failing to provide anything that come close to a coherent argument.  Here are some highlights.  I am not behaving like a child.  Fuckin' A, man.  Fuckin', fuckin', fuckin' A, man.  How has science eliminated refraction?  Yeah, okay.  I'll tell you what they did, shall I?  Don't tell me what they did.  That is not my question.  It literally was your question.  I have garnered evidence.  Oh, excellent.  You're going to show it, is there, or not?  Not.  Oh, why am I not surprised?  I have hundreds of hours of footage.  Oh, brilliant.  Can we see that then, or not?  Not.  So you've got loads of evidence and loads of footage, but you're not going to show any of us any of it, even though you're in a debate about it.  Hmm.  Sounds like you're just making it up to me.  That's what pushes my buttons.  Making shit up.  But you do not have an open mind.  Yeah, he really did himself proud, didn't he?  But fortunately for us, at the end of the debate, he did leave us with all the photographs that we never got to see because he was too busy being childish and shouting at everybody.  So today, in his absence, we're going to bring up those photographs and we're going to see if we can figure out what evidence he had and what this magical ether band is.  Because after all, he did accuse me of this.  You are not willing to listen to the evidence that I have garnered.  I have garnered evidence.  Yes, we should all be aware that he has in fact garnered evidence.  But what does that mean?  So anyway, we're going to look at his evidence and then I'm going to need a hero, a globe hero, a warrior, a true genius to come forward and debunk it all for us.  Now, if only I knew one.  Ranty, of course, you are my absolute hero.  Will you come back later on and destroy the ether band, please?  Absolutely can't wait.  Evidence for the ether band.  Evidence for the ether band.  It's a plain truth.  evidence for the ether band that's definitely not made up.  So now it's time to look at all the evidence that the plain truth brought to the debate, but was too busy being childish to actually show.  Now, what I really wanted to do was get in touch with the plain truth so he could maybe voice over these photographs so we could hear how they were evidence.  But unfortunately, he wasn't available.  So I had to get the cat to do it for me.  Okay, this is my first photograph and what you'll see is that this is clear evidence that I have learnt how to overlay text onto a photograph.  And this photograph here is clear evidence that when I actually need to overlay text on a photograph to explain what it's showing, I forgot how to do it.  And this photograph... Oh no, that one shouldn't be there.  I was just practising my artwork.  Next!  I sent this one in as well to show that it's evidence that we know how mirages are made.  And this one here is actually a transformer.  It's Optimus Prime's cousin and when he wants to, he turns into a rather handy purse.  Now these next few you're about to see are all photographs that are examples of mirages that form something that looks completely different to a perfectly defined horizon.  So in other words, they debunk my own argument for me.  So as what I suppose was inevitable, all the evidence of plain truth brought to the debate was the fact that he could take photographs of things we already know exist, like mirages.  And had he behaved like an adult and we could have had a conversation, I truly believe that this is how the debate could have gone.  Okay, so here we have four pictures.  And what I'd like to do is ask you just two questions.  Firstly, which is the odd one out?  And secondly, why?  Yeah, those are, yep, great.  I appreciate those two questions.  I'll try to be as succinct as possible.  Okay, thank you, sir, and I appreciate that.  So, as succinctly as possible, which of these is the odd one out?  Fucking A, man!  No, it's not A. Do you want to try again?  Fucking A!  No, it's still not A. Try again.  You, sir, are a dogmatic scientific priest, okay?  Well, thank you very much.  I do try, but the correct answer here is D. You see, A, B, and C are all what mirages look like.  A does not look like a perfectly defined horizon that is hiding a boat from the bottom up.  Yes, it does.  Yes, it does.  Well, now you're just acting like a child.  I am not behaving like a child.  Okay, now three of these photographs show obstruction that has got nothing to do with a mirage.  They all show a perfectly defined horizon.  What I'm asking you to do is identify the odd one out, which is caused by a mirage.  Fucking A, man!  Well done.  You finally got there.  And as if to try and prove my point for me, just earlier this week, Ranty Flat Earth made this community post right here, in which he showed this photograph, showing us yet again that distance and refraction have absolutely no role whatsoever in making things vanish from the bottom up.  I love you, Ranty.  You know, we can give him any Flat Earth proof, and within no time at all, he can just rip it apart.  Ten minutes later.  Funny as.  Exactly, you can debunk it just like that.  The guy's amazing.  Now, the plain truth, if you're watching, let me show you this little analogy to show you what the rest of us hear when you give your argument about the ether band.  This is how silly your argument is.  Hello.  Hello, I'm a flat earther, similar to but not the same as The Plain Truth on YouTube and I just wanted to tell you that I took some photographs today of tomatoes and they are red.  That's nice.  But I also want to tell you that my gran got a new car today and it had no spur wheel.  I don't see your point.  Well, my point is, the fact that tomatoes are red must be the reason me gran's got no spare wheel.  You do realise that two things can exist without necessarily being linked to each other, don't you?  Oh, you are so close-minded and not willing to listen to any of the evidence I have garnered, because I have garnered evidence, and I'm also not going to show you any of that evidence, but I have garnered it.  and that is how silly your argument is.  but ultimately the plain truth knows that this is what he sounds like because just like any flat earther he's starting from a position where he believes the earth is flat and anything that blatantly says otherwise has to be completely ignored.  but it can't be forgotten.  and it's that cognitive dissonance that makes the flat earthers so irritable and angry all the time.  And even in the plain truth's own words, he has no evidence, no scientific explanation at all for his ridiculous made-up ether band claim.  I just want to confirm something from the notes I'm making, and that is that, just so I can pick it up later on, when I asked you, do you have any scientific papers or evidence about your assertions, the answer was no, wasn't it?  I just need to make sure I wrote that down properly.  You've got no scientific evidence, explanation or papers, yeah?  Correct.  I'm the source for this information.  Thank you.  Yes.  Anyways, we've come to a close on this video.  I was totally gobsmacked that after the debate, the Plain Truth and a number of other Flat Earth channels chose to mirror the video in whole or mirror parts of the video as if the Plain Truth had somehow provided any sort of coherent explanation whatsoever.  And on one of those mirrored videos, the part where I talked about refraction, I spotted this little gem as a comment.  Well, I really just have got to say it's very, very clear to me that this paid presenter, he's never been on top of a tidal swell 20 miles off the coast of Sydney in a kayak.  Yeah, that's obvious.  Now, I had no idea what that question meant.  Is it a saying that I'm not familiar with?  Is it some sort of evidence or explanation on how the ether band works?  I wasn't sure.  So I had to, yet again, for a second week running, turn to my internet heroes for help.  Oh, conspiracy cats, welcome back.  I'm glad you were happy with the answer I gave you the other day.  Your next question, have you ever been on top of a tidal swell 20 miles off the coast of Sydney in a kayak?  Not a kayak, a kayak.  Oh no, I did spell Kayet wrong, but it was on purpose, honest.  No, I've never been to Australia, and to be honest, if I would go, I would not go into the water, because if I wanted to take a bath with swimming knives, I'd read more Sylvia Platt poetry, not take a dip with sharks.  So, I hope that answers your question.  So perhaps rightly so, last week's Internet Hero treated that question with the contempt it deserved.  But what I was not prepared for was how last week's runner-up was gonna treat the question.  All I can say is I was truly humbled to the point where I've put his link in the description just so people can go over and tell him what a great guy he is.  And I've even subscribed to his channel myself and I'm watching it now on a daily basis.  Guy's got a great personality and I'm hugely hooked on it.  So, how did this week's winner of our Internet Heroes competition answer this question.  Let's find out.  Right, so, have you ever been in a kayak?  Conspiracy.  Have you ever been on top of a tidal swell 20 miles off the coast of Sydney in a kayak?  Well, I'm 57 years old.  I might have done and just forgotten about it.  I might have done.  Is that a nice thing to do, Mr.  Conspiracy Cat?  Everybody wants to be a cat.  Because the cat's the only one who knows where he's at.  It sounds quite good.  I have been on top... Just off the coast of Sydney.  I have been on top of rocks on the side.  I can't remember the area now, but it was the most beautiful place... fishermen Australian fishermen go out and they do fishing and they stand on these rocks and the tide is swelling like that not waves.  there's all plaques on the wall behind.  fishermen have been out there usually at night time and suddenly the swell comes up and takes them out never to be seen again.  absolutely beautiful.  swell takes them out and then just smashes you against the rocks and that's it.  bye bye bye bye.  i am not behaving like a child.  you are not willing to listen to the evidence that i have garnered.  i have garnered evidence.
