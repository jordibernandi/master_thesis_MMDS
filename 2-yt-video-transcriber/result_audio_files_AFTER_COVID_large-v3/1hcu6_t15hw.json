The Bidens have effectively admitted it was wrong, and in private, they've said it out loud.  Now, we played some audio last night to show you this.  We have more audio tonight.  You're about to hear Rob Walker and James Gillier, those are two of the Biden family's business partners, on a call with Tony Bobulinski.  They're discussing how very worried they are that this story, the one we're talking about now, would emerge into the press, that it would become public.  And they wanted to figure out how to handle the fallout from that.  This audio is very new.  Here it is. ",

            "text": "It's almost touching how naive they are.  Now, these are politically sophisticated people, of course.  They serve the Biden family.  They're Democrats.  It goes without saying.  But they're convinced in the call you heard, and this was just taped not long ago, that if this story comes out, the media will verify it and it will blow up.  In other words, even the Biden family's business partners, the Biden family itself, wasn't counting on the media to side with them to the extent they have to bury all this damaging information.  The information is obviously incriminating.  They had no idea that every news network and every journalist in this country would actually suppress it because that's never happened in America before.  They thought they were busted when it came out.  They didn't realize only one cable channel would cover it. ",
