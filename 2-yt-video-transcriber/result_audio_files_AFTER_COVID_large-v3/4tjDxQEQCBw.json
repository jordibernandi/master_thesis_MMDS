            "text": "I'm going into this to show you, beloved, that this Bible is talking about you.  From one cover to another.  From Genesis to Revelation.  It is a road map for our salvation.  Everything I've said tonight is written in this book.  All your suffering is detailed in this book.  Remember when I said you came and there were 64 years of hidden history where you lost your language?  That's in the book.  Where is it in the book?  Our sojourn in America for 400 years is written in the book.  The condition that we would be in right now is written in the book.  Jesse Jackson's rise, it's written in the book.  America's fall, America's fall, it's written in the book.  The change of world, it's written in the book.  Ronald Reagan, it's written in the book.  it's all in the book.  if you know where to look that's right.  you know the bible don't mention america and it don't mention negro.  is that right?  come on.  but you know if the prophets could see they had to be able to see a government that rose as high as this one And they had to be able to see 30 million people who fell as low as we have been brought.  We were brought to nothing.  And America has ascended to the height on our backs.  Is that right?  Is that written in the book?  Then if it's written in the book and we read it from the book, then don't you get afraid for what's in the book.  Yes, sir.  Everybody alright?  I ain't gonna be long now.  Daniel says, certain of the Hebrews were brought out of Jerusalem into Babylon.  And there their names were changed, their learning was changed, Their tongue was changed Their diet was changed.  They were called.  I think their names were Hananiah I believe Azariah Daniel.  There was another one.  I can't recall his name but it's there.  The king of Babylon changed their name To Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.  Changed Daniel's name, called him Belshazzar.  After the wicked king.  How did your name get changed?  How did your language get changed?  How did your learning get changed?  And the king's meat that you are eating today is a meat that you never ate back home.  Let's go to the Genesis.  I'm not going to be long.  I want you to see how great you are in the eyes of God.  Why Jesse must rise today and why you and I rise with him And what does it mean for America and the world?  Y'all all right Why would the Bible begin with Genesis and it's called the first book of Moses?  Moses was a liberator But the Bible begins with a Genesis.  Genesis means the beginning.  When you deal with genetics, you deal with the essence of the character and characteristics of the human being in the genes.  and everything grows from the genes and manifests, but you cannot alter what is there.  Once it is there, the coding is set, then it must come forward.  Genesis contains the coding for the whole Bible.  In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.  God created the dialectic.  He created the two opposite poles.  Heaven and earth, he's master of both.  He said the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep.  What was wrong with the heavens?  That the earth was without form and void.  Anytime the earth is without form and void, the heavens are not doing their duty by the earth.  Because when the light that is in the heavens strikes the earth, the earth begins to turn.  And the light's power striking the earth at the equator causes the earth to spin.  at the speed of 1,037 and a third miles per hour, making four dips, giving the Earth her seasons.  The sun and the moon draw the water up from the Earth's surface into the Earth's rotation, which is called gravitation, in a fine mist that the naked eye can hardly detect.  And as that mist gathers together with other mists, it forms clouds.  As the cold and hot currents of air pass over the clouds.  If it's a warm air current passing over the clouds, when the cloud gets heavier than gravity, she distills back to the earth in the form of a purified water.  And when the water strikes the earth in the season, and the sunlight strikes the earth with the water and the seed, then the seed swells and bursts, bringing forth a luxuriant vegetation on the earth.  can never be without form.  The earth can never be without form if the heavens are doing their job.  But something was wrong in the heavens.  The heavens were not relating properly to the earth.  What does it mean?  The people The masses of the people are uncultivated.  The masses of the people are undeveloped.  They are raw seeds.  They have not had the water of life and the sunlight, the energy of truth to germinate them and bring them forward as manifestations of God.  What happened to the heavens?  The heavens represent those who are supposed to be the light balance.  Are you listening?  Don't tell anybody you carry the light and your people are undeveloped.  your light is out.  Don't tell anybody.  you carry the light and your people are walking in the darkness of ignorance.  Don't tell anybody you believe that all men are created equal and are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights and among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.  and a whole host of people black, brown, red, yellow and white are locked out of that pursuit of happiness.  If the heavens, meaning the lights, if those who run the church, those who run the schools, those who run government, those who fashion institutions do not feed the masses, then the masses are void without form.  when you void a check.  Come on now.  You can't use it.  It's useless.  When you void a people, they are of no value.  Black people have been met, people have been met, people aid void of no value in the society.  Chicanos, Hispanics, Native Americans.  Brought to nothing.  And the learning and the power of knowledge has not been shared with you.  So God said, let there be light.  Because he don't want man to walk in darkness.  Since the heavens would not do their duty by the earth.  then God had to bring up a light for the earth.  So the book in the 26th verse in Genesis, he said, let us make a man.  Why are you going to make a man, God?  Because those who were responsible for feeding the masses have sucked the blood of the masses.  so that they might live in luxury while they deprive the masses of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  I'm going to make the masses a man.  I'm going to make a man.  Where are you going to make him from?  I'm going to make him from the dust of the earth.  I'm going to make him from that which is nothing and useless to prove that I'm God.  As I created the heavens and the earth from nothing, liberator.  Remember, this is the book of Moses.  He's teaching Moses, I'm sending you to a people that are nothing.  But I made the heavens and the earth from nothing.  And now I'm making you from dust.  And I'm going to give you power and dominion over the fowl of the air, the fish of the sea, and every creeping thing that crawls upon the earth.  But remember, boy, you better obey me.  But when the boy messed up, Adam fell.  Where did he fall from?  Did he fall off the rostrum?  Did he fall from heaven to the earth?  No.  He fell from a condition of peace and contentment of mind because his mind was not in obedience to the will of God.  He started obeying his own urges and desires.  So the deceitful one deceived him into eating a fruit.  It don't mean eating an apple.  It means devouring a teaching that was foreign to what God had ordered him to eat.  How do you know it's a teaching?  It is because He was forbidden to eat of a tree in the midst of the garden.  A tree of the knowledge of good and evil.  Trees don't know good and trees don't know evil.  They're just trees.  It's a man that have both knowledges in him.  The knowledge of good and the knowledge of evil.  So when that kind of man produces a teaching, he produces lies mixed with truth.  And since the heavens and the earth is created in truth and it is only sustained and perpetuated and maintained by truth and you are from the God of heaven and from the earth, you can only be perpetual and maintained by truth.  Then when somebody feeds you lies mixed with truth.  then they feed you a poison fruit that will cause you to fall down from your spiritual condition.  Now listen, I'm almost finished.  Why do you think Jesus said, I am the light of the world?  Why did he say it?  Because the world was in darkness.  The rulers of Rome were not feeding the masses.  The institutions of Rome were not cultivating the people.  So God sent Jesus into the world and filled him with light.  That he may start a new season for the people.  If they would come to the light.  You got the message?  All of that is talking about you and me.  Genesis says, know of a surety, Abraham, your seed is going to be a stranger in a land that is not theirs.  And they shall serve them and they shall afflict them 400 years.  But after that time, Abraham, I will come.  I'm not sending nobody.  I'm coming myself.  And I'm going to judge that nation which they shall serve.  Nobody on earth, listen carefully, no history on earth shows a people in bondage for 400 years.  You don't find it in ancient history.  You don't find it in Egyptian history.  You don't find it in medieval history.  You don't find it in African history.  You find it in modern history.  When was it fulfilled?  When your fathers and mine were brought to America in 1555, we were brought into a land that was strange.  by a people whose ways and customs and habits were strange and the stranger afflicted us and our fathers in this land every day of every week of every month of every year that we have been here.  he is a man on this rostrum tonight, whose daughter's life was snuffed out at 21 years of age, hadn't begun to live because some brutal beast in a blue uniform had the power to kill and might made right and corrupt district attorneys and corrupt judges and a corrupt police department covered up naked wanton brutal murder.  How long?  How long?  It's over.  Never again.  There's a new day now.  Our 400 years of serving white folks is up.  Wait a minute.  They have done the job that God wanted them to do.  You say, what did God want us to do?  Whenever God wants to use you, he puts you not in ease.  He puts you in the furnace of affliction.  I heard a joke the other day.  God and the devil were talking.  The Lord called down to hell and said, Satan, how are things going?  He said, things are going fine.  Got lots of Negroes down here.  He said, well, how are they getting along?  He said, they're having a good time. ",
