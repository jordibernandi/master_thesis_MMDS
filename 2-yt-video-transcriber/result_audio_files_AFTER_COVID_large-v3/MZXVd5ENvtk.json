            "text": "i am so happy that i have found this edge detect thing in this skimp program.  look at these ships.  look at that.  these are not specks of dust.  okay these ships are out there.  these ships are real and they're the white ships.  look at them.  i'm just going to go down here really slow because i am just so excited.  look at the shape of these ships.  oh my gosh Oh my goodness.  I just, yeah, I'm just about blown away from it.  I really am.  It's just like, it really does make me smile and makes me happy on the inside to share these with you.  Yeah, it does.  I will put these pictures in the video individually so you can look at them at your leisure.  But look at that.  I'm going to pause this because I want to show you another picture that I was excited about.  okay we're gonna watch me do this edge detect together because this is the coolest thing.  man it really is.  we're gonna come over here to the edge.  boom look at that.  I'm gonna say okay and I'm going to go to this little magnifying thing and I am going to zoom in.  wait till you see this.  this is so cool.  let's move this over down here.  um we are going to look at these ships.  wait for it.  yeah boom let's zoom in one more time.  look at here.  look inside.  here can you see that in there these are compartments and there are beings in there and or ships in there.  look at that.  one more zoom.  boom we can do this.  we can do this together.  we can watch it together.  look at that.  And I have seen these long ships in the sky.  And I'm sure you've seen them too.  If you've seen these clouds that are long, white, and rectangular, kind of boxy looking, then you have seen these ships.  And you have also probably seen the compartments in there where these beings and or these ships looking out of it.  Look at that.  How can anyone dismiss this?  Well, they can dismiss it if they don't even want to open up their eyes or their mind to the reality that we are not alone.  look at these.  look at this.  look at these compartments.  and these are the beings that I see in the sky inside these ships.  now granted they could be don't know they could be mechanical they could be little shuttles that look like big faces or something but these are.  these are what looks like I've captured in the sky and here they're showing up on my photos like this and I have no explanation.  I really don't but I think this is the coolest thing it really is.  let's look at this.  oh my gosh Yeah, and I will include pictures in this.  I just wanted to go over this.  This is so exciting.  It really is.  Oh my, let me zoom out.  Let me try to get them all in here at the same time.  Look at that.  Look at this.  These ships are up there in the sky.  Look at that.  Up there.  Boom.  I'm so happy to find the edge detect.  I really am.  Look at this.  We'll just scroll down just a tad bit.  Look at this.  This is a big ol' lightship right there.  Boom, boom.  This is the one that stuck out the most in the original photo, but then I wasn't expecting to see all that detail in those ships.  I'm telling you right now, I was not expecting to see this right here.  So I am gonna pause that because this really makes my heart flutter.  It really does.  Yes, I'm so very thankful and it is so humbling to be able to share this with you.  It is absolutely humbling.  So let me pause this.  I've got to put this video together and get it out there.  I really do.  Okay, we're just going to look at one more photo with this edge detect.  And you know, I guess it's a give and take.  You never know which ships, how your photo is going to affect the edge detect, but I think it's pretty amazing.  We're just going to scroll down and look at these ships right here.  This is the bottom of the big orb, the like, I don't know, organic mother orb ship, mother ship orb thing that's out there.  Let's look at these.  I'll try to go slow.  I really will.  Man.  Look at this.  It is truly amazing.  Absolutely amazing.  But I'm telling you what, that ship before this, that is some mega detail.  Major, major details.  Let me see if this will scroll over so I can see over here for you all.  Again, it's the bottom of the orb ship, the big mother ship thing.  Look at this.  Yeah, so I'm going to pause this, and I'm just going to go ahead and put this video together, and I'm, yes, I'm just going to do it.  I'm just going to show one inverted picture.  You can see that they still maintain their shape really well when you invert it.  You can see the notches and stuff.  I'm just going to scroll down through here.  Because it is important, you know, to see the pictures in the inverted mode and the edge detect.  Look down there.  Pretty neat.  Yeah.  So I'm going to pause this.  I'm going to include this into the video too.  And then I'm just going to put the rest of the pictures.  I know I keep saying that, but I really need to make this video short, not too long at all.  One more.  Look at this.  Look at these ships here.  Um, Let's see if I can somehow make this go down.  This is so exciting.  I really am excited, you all.  That's why I can't quit adding videos.  Look at that.  Look at these ships.  Yeah, look at that.  Oh, my gosh.  Yeah.  It's spectacular.  It really is.  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  So I'm going to pause this.  I will.  This is my last video and I'm going to add these pictures, I promise.
