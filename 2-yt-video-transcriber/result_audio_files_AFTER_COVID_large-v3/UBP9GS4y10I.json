            "text": "Welcome to the Shikama Live Show with your host, Shikama.  Be sure to interact with the video.  That means to thumbs up, thumbs down, leave a comment, share the video, and subscribe and click the bell.  A little brief news.  There is a suggestion that Las Vegas, where I live, will have a second shutdown of its own.  due to the renewed spike in the outbreak.  So businesses are preparing for that.  Bill Cosby, 82, blind, denied national mandate to serve time at home.  In an effort to regain an O.J.  Simpson-like frenzy of news watching, the mainstream media crafted this story about Bill Cosby and ran it 24-7. hoping to regain viewership like in the time of O.J Unfortunately, it didn't work for them.  The news cycle moved on.  Two weeks later, but the irreparable damage was done.  A legendary black icon was destroyed, Bill Cosby.  Not only that, but they removed the crowning jewel of the black American community, the Bill Cosby Show.  And black media, which is actually owned by Jewish white people, came out against him and a new political movement, which was searching for a man to destroy at their crowning jewel in their pink house.  better known as the Me Too move.  It was the first victory, that's what they say.  Forget that Hollywood had countless men who legitimately were known abusers.  They had to take down the black icon.  They were so convincing in their portrayal of wholesome Cosby as a monster, but the problem was the accusations were all ridiculous, brought by women of ill repute.  half the women were professional women, if you know what I mean.  70% were on some sort of drugs, and half the allegations were nothing.  Literally, some of them said, he walked past me at a party.  A full 60% were demonstrously false.  One woman accused him of of something when he wasn't even in the state.  Tin accused him of something, and he wasn't even at the event in question.  But then they got their smoking gun.  But there was a problem.  Statues of limitations had run out, and the case had already been settled, rich man-like.  Meaning, rich people settle things out of court, with money to make things just go away.  They sealed the case, she got her money, and all was lost.  No, seriously, she spent all the money.  Millions.  Spent millions of dollars in a matter of a few years.  Folks, how long would it take you to waste millions of dollars if you were ever given that?  I don't mean how long.  How long could you make millions of dollars last?  Some people quit their job.  Not so fast, they changed the law for Cosby, broke the seal case, and the media ran with the narrative he confessed in that case.  Free synopsis from a 30-year law school student, he never confessed to anything.  Also, the woman in question is an open and obvious lesbian.  And, when you get down to the accusation... It was never brought before the police, like all the other 40 women, or 39 women.  The news jumped up.  By the time this woman came to the district attorney, the accusation was years old, with no evidence, no police report.  She wanted money.  The district attorney questioned her on three separate occasions.  Each time, she was questioned, a different story appeared.  Different year, different date.  different circumstances, and there was the big, gaping, huge problem of her going back to his house 60 times, texting him 20,000 times after the supposed incident.  Oh yes, they pulled all of her phone records, just in case she was telling the truth, but no.  The district attorney dismissed her claim, but not before getting Cosby to make a deposition and settle out of court.  He had to get money from for the woman.  He hated Cosby, or thought he did, until the new district attorney won the election.  where the first district attorney said there was no case, the second district attorney ran on a platform that he would prosecute Cosby, which is all sorts of unconstitutional, illegal, unethical, and he should be disbarred.  But wait, there's even more stuff he should be disbarred for.  I should hope with his video, maybe somebody will see the video and say, let's take a look at this.  Just for everybody's information, the FBI is investigating that particular district.  I'm sorry, the Department of Justice is taking a look at that particular district.  They have a reputation for corruption.  Years ago, they came in and threw judges, district attorneys, regular attorneys, in jail for corruption.  That exact county.  It just so happens that the particular family the woman is from is 100% anti-black.  How do they avoid this problem in the media and court?  Simple.  Don't let anybody who knows about that testify.  Don't report the story.  Don't say anything about it.  There was also another problem.  Andrea Constant confessed to her university colleague that nothing happened, that she was doing it all for money.  Then Gloria Allred shows up.  and tries to extort Cosby for $100 million to six of the women she was representing.  Cosby, of course, said no.  In fact, he turned around and sued them and won.  What's that?  What's that you say, Shikama?  He won?  Yes, he won.  Seems that wasn't in the news, and that wasn't allowed in court.  but the women were allowed in court.  The media was so convincing that people everywhere believe Cosby is a monster, an animal, etc.  And they are so convinced they go on social media to spout all this garbage about how he's a monster and an animal.  But the problem is no evidence was presented.  That was such a problem that even the View talk show said it's a dark day in American history when a man can be convicted.  with no evidence.  That's right, the view cited with Cosby in this case.  The view.  They're women, did you know that?  But, what about the family friend that was corroborating that this was all a setup to get money?  What about the university colleague that said Andrea Constantine confessed to her?  What happened to them?  They weren't allowed to testify.  In fact, Andrea Constantine denied ever knowing the university colleague in the first trial.  In the second trial, She said she barely worked with her.  After proof was shown that they lived together on away trips, the judge denied the woman from testifying at all in both trials.  But wait, there's more.  The prosecution received evidence that exonerated Cosby.  Exonerate means proves that he's innocent.  That's right, folks.  The new district attorney had proof.  none of this was real But he didn't let the Cosby team know this.  It was leaked to the Cosby team by one of the office workers.  When this was brought up in court, the judge denied it.  At this point, any intelligent person would see that the district attorney and judge are corrupt.  Also, at this point, no jury would convict him.  And that's what happened in the first trial.  The jury said no case was presented.  Well, the DA filed for a second trial, and the judge granted it.  Folks, are you regular people?  That doesn't happen normally.  Something was up.  In a mistrial where the jury says, you have no case, you can hang it up.  But not this DA and judge.  And what about these women?  How credible were these accusations?  Not a single one was credible.  Add into that Gloria Allred trying to con Cosby out of $100 million, holding press conferences where 80-year-old women were crying like something just happened.  One showed up on drugs, and not a single reporter asked about it.  The tabloids denied these women their story.  Not even one iota of truth was in it.  They had been pitching this story to get money for decades.  Folks, we're talking about the credibility of the actual allegation.  The tabloids sat down face-to-face with these women, heard their allegation, and said, no, we're not printing it.  You are on drugs.  No, we're not printing this.  You just want money to get drugs.  So, what's the truth about Cosby?  In his younger days, Cosby hung out with the Rat Pack.  He was a member of the Playboy Mansion.  He was young, good-looking, rich... and part of the cool crowd.  This was in the 60s.  20 years later, and about 50 TV shows later, Cosby hits on the Bill Cosby show.  He's changed his image.  He's older, but the women didn't want to let go, but he wasn't like that anymore, and the Rat Pack was gone.  Hefner himself was old.  Cosby always did stuff for the black community, and Bill Cosby's show was his great homage to his own family.  His wife, Camille, was portrayed on screen as well as all of his children.  They were portrayed as upper middle class, not rich, and black on TV with a father in the home.  It revolutionized the idea of black people.  People across America thought of black people as people for the first time in the history of the country.  Hollywood hated it, but Cosby paid for his and produced his along with his wife.  You don't know.  Hollywood hated Cosby since he first appeared on TV.  Were they mistreated all the other black actors back then?  Cosby was his own man.  They wouldn't stand for it.  But unlike all the other black actors, he didn't go begging for work.  He also did his own productions, movies, TV shows, his own stuff.  Hollywood hated that.  where they could portray blacks as pimps, prostitutes, and criminals.  Cosby always threw a monkey wrench into that narrative, especially when he was seen around, being wealthy, good-looking, with a gorgeous wife that wouldn't leave him.  It gave Hollywood nightmares.  Then this Me Too stuff happened.  He was black, rich, powerful.  Well, not anymore.  But who's counting?  They attacked him immediately.  Now, During this outbreak, this pandemic, there's a Department of Justice mandate to remove all elderly prisoners and make them serve their sentence at home.  Let me rephrase that.  There is no qualification that the Department of Justice put on the prisoner as to who can and cannot serve their time at home, especially if they are elderly.  In his state, the governor said, Cosby was ineligible, the governor.  Ladies and gentlemen, if you don't think Cosby isn't a political prisoner, I don't know what's wrong with you.  Thank you. ",
