Happy New Year's, happy New Year's, happy New Year's to everyone around the world.  I just wanted to give a quick message real quick.  I haven't seen you guys in a long time.  I know if you don't follow me on Instagram, I haven't really been on here.  I keep saying I'm gonna do it.  So here I am doing it.  I wanted to say that I love you guys so much, so much.  I wanted to tell you from the bottom of my heart that Really, you guys, the support, the love has been so beautiful and I'm so grateful for each and every single one of you guys that supported me this year, that joined my tribe and my family.  God, I'm getting all nervous and stuff.  But I just wanted to say truly from the bottom of my heart, I'm like hyper and nervous and excited and like everything put together.  I wanted to say that it really meant the world to me.  I'm so grateful to have met so many incredible people because I chose to spoke the truth and stand up for what I believe is right and for humanity and for planet Earth.  and I'm never going to be done on that mission.  I just thought you should know, obviously there are things that I can't say on here.  I'm like a child that's grounded.  Um, but really like what I went through this year has been quite interesting and I'm sure it has been for all of us, I suppose.  But, um, your support and your amazing endless thousands and thousands of Comments and messages have filled my heart with so much joy and love.  It means the world to me you guys it really does Mm-hmm.  I'm always losing my voice.  It really means the world to me and I just wanted to come on here real quick and thank you guys so much for all the support.  and lastly Be safe Be happy.  Be grateful.  There is a million things to be grateful for.  Don't ever forget it.  I know that there's a lot of crazy things happening in the world, like always.  There's always crazy things happening.  But stay true to yourself.  Follow your intuition.  Follow what your heart tells you.  And create a world within this world for yourself and for your loved ones.  Um, and you know, I have my opinions on what's to come this year.  Um, maybe some of it is, I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  So then maybe it's just intuitive downloads that I get and just visions that I feel like I see in the future, um, for what's to come.  But regardless of what's to come, I want you guys to stay strong, stay vigilant, stay truthful to yourself.  Follow your intuition.  Follow what you think is right.  Don't look at what everyone else is doing.  And please be safe.  Please be happy.  Please try, no matter what the world has set up, try to live the best life that you possibly can this year and every year of the rest of your life.  I'm really excited for what's to come this year.  There are a lot of things that I'm not excited about.  Can you guess what it is?  It starts with a B and other stuff.  But it doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter because God's plan.  I have visions and I'm very excited for what's to come.  And I hopefully I want to and I will be sharing more of my life with you guys and more of my wisdom and more of my insights with you guys.  I have so much that I sometimes, I'm so overwhelmed with the amount of information that I know that I don't even know where to begin.  Like, where does one begin?  Where does one begin?  So I've been really pondering on that for a moment.  Anyways, okay, I'm gonna wrap this up.  Love you guys, stay safe.  Thank you for all of your support this year.  Thank you for still sticking around even though I don't post videos every day or sometimes for months on end.  I love you.  I love you.  I really love you guys.  I want everybody to be safe and that everyone is being, I'm going to send good vibes for everybody to be protected and that God is always going to watch over us and that God wins.  Don't forget that.  We win, God wins, humanity wins.  We're going to get through this.  And happy new year, you guys.  Let's welcome 2021.  And let's see what's to come.  Apparently, the best has yet to come.  Love you.  Bye. ",
