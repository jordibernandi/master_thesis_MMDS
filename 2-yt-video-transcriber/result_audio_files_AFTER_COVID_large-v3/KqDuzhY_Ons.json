And while collecting the videos to put on here, I decided to do an entire AOC video, which is already up.  Watch it after this one if you'd like.  It's amazing.  I also decided to do top 10 videos on Joe Biden and Maxine Waters.  Watch out for both of those coming out in the next few days.  And we start with number 10.  But before that, I... have to sell you something.  What can you say about gold right now?  It's zooming ahead, up around 24% since this time last year.  It's projected to reach $1,600, even $2,000 according to CNBC recently.  And this was before the China virus broke out.  With so much uncertainty at the moment, the stock market wobbling, gold in your IRA or 401k makes sense.  why?  because it acts like a balance.  if stocks fall gold will be your safety net.  you don't buy insurance as your house is burning down.  you buy it before it happens.  same with gold.  get it now before the price rockets even further.  this is the breakthrough lots of people have been waiting years for and it's fallen right into your lap.  it's quick and easy to sort out.  noble gold.  do all the heavy lifting for you.  so call them today.  No, no, don't wait.  Call them right now.  It's 877-646-5347 and get your insurance pinned down.  Number 10, Maisie Hirono, Democrats are just too smart. ",

The days when you just being able to, you just being willing to work hard and you can now walk into a plant and suddenly there's gonna be a job for you for 30 years or 40 years, that's just not gonna be there for our kids.  What we have to do is to make sure that folks are trained for the jobs that are coming in now, because some of those jobs of the past are just not gonna come back.  The president has delivered, at least to this point, what he promised.  The manufacturing revival, the economic revival he promised in 2016 is well underway.  32,000 jobs added in manufacturing, 30,000 in construction.  What magic wand do you have?  How exactly are you going to negotiate that?  Let's go sector by sector and look at the positive and negative here.  A big difference here is in manufacturing, relatively higher paying jobs where President Trump has done 386,000 more jobs or that's been done under his presidency than under President Obama.  Just not going to come back.  Just not going to come back.  Just not going to come back.  Wholesale trade a little bit better and mining and logging also.  that was negative under Obama.

The premise of their argument, so lauded by the progressive masses, is based on a fundamental misrepresentation of tax collection.  That is, that taxes are collected from the common man.  No, taxes are not collected from the common man.  The top 1% paid a greater share of individual income taxes than the bottom 90% combined.  The top 50% of all taxpayers paid 97% of all total taxes.  Individual income taxes.  Basically, rich people pay all the taxes in this country.  To say that there is no such thing as a self-made man is malarkey.  Look, if you want to say that these business owners aren't self-made men because they are benefiting from the resources pooled by the federal government, fine.  But that's not money that came from the lower classes.  These millionaires aren't standing on the shoulders of the public.  They're standing on the shoulders of other millionaires.  Okay, if we're going to redistribute the wealth that they've generated appropriately, then we need to distribute it back to these other millionaires.  And I don't think that's what Warren had in mind.  But that's accurate.  That's an accurate representation of how these businesses are facilitated by the public infrastructure.  That's the real story.  So Pocahontas' claim that the entrepreneurs of the world owe something to the public, the speech that first made her famous, It's total bunk.  But Hillary wasn't quite clever enough to reiterate Warren's sentiment effectively.  Something got mixed up, and she ended up claiming that businesses don't create jobs.  Not only that, but... Not only that, but don't let anybody tell you that either.  If they start saying it, plug your ears and start screaming, reclaiming my time.

Now, I... visualized islands in the same way when I was maybe three years old.  This, ladies and gentlemen, is a sitting US congressman.  Let me just say that finding these clips was incredibly difficult because YouTube appears to be actively hiding videos that cast a negative light on Democrats or Democrat ideas.  It's bizarre.  Now we're all aware that YouTube modifies its algorithm to reduce the number of subscribers conservatives like myself have, and to constrict the distribution of our videos, etc.  But to hide negative reporting on Democrats, that's another step toward actively manipulating the public to influence elections.  Now I am a firm believer in free expression, and that includes the people over at YouTube.  But when the method that you employ to express your views is the suppression of other people's ideas, well to me, that needs to be stopped.  Your expression should not include silencing everyone else's.  That's called oppression.  I don't care if YouTube is a private entity, the practice needs to be regulated and stopped entirely.  The free expression of political ideas is necessary for the health of any free republic.  The US government must regulate YouTube immediately.  I know a lot of conservatives and certainly libertarians will not like me saying that.  But it's true.  All right, well, that's it for me.  Thanks for watching.  And remember, it's not that our liberal friends are ignorant.  It's just that they know so much.  that isn't so.  Good night. ",
