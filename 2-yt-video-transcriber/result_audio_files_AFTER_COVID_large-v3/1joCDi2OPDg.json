            "text": "Carla loves men.  No, I mean she really loves men.  She loves men so much.  she loves them two at a time.  Wait, not at the same time in the same room.  Let me start over.  Carla loves men so much.  she can love them in the same day.  in two separate places.  meet jack.  jack is a nice guy a devoted husband a dutiful father.  jack thought everything was going great.  he was married with a daughter and a son.  he had a nice job.  life was good or so he thought.  one day he went to plug in the ipad to recharge for his son to play with.  later.  lo and behold his wife's facebook was open on it.  he noticed that it was on messenger and timmy tim was talking to her.  he scrolled through the messages and quickly realized timmy tim wasn't reconnecting with her about their old hometown.  the next day when he came home from work he noticed that she was on her phone with her girl friends a lot.  he headed for the den got on the ipad and connected to her phone.  their caller was chatting with timmy tim again.  she was trash-talking.  jack carla stated started sharing what went on in the bedroom and describing how quickly it was over one hour at most.  never mind he had to go to work every day.  but hold on timmy.  tim was dropping.  i love you's and i'm coming to town timmy.  tim wanted her to spend the week-end with him.  when he came in all expenses paid at the ritz ambassador suite jack was screen-shotting everything and carlo was deleting the conversation every other second.  over the next few weeks they kept making plans.  jack was getting angrier and angrier but he had to keep it together.  when carla asked jack what was wrong he just said work work's been been hard lately.  she shrugged and let him be.  jack crafted a plan so devious it would stun and shock everyone even if he told them how he did it.  first he went to his lawyer and had him draft a contract for carla to move out.  immediately he went and removed all the money from their joint accounts and redirected his direct deposit to an all-new separate bank account.  then the night came.  honey i need a spa day.  no a spa weekend with the girls.  can you watch the kids?  of course he could watch the kids go have fun with the girls.  Carla thought Jack was so oblivious.  Here's a hundred dollars, splurge on that apricot facial scrub.  You deserve it, honey.  She left without so much as a kiss on the cheek.  Clearly, Carla was so into this weekend already, she missed that detail.  In fact, as Jack closed the door, he went over all the little cues she had been neglecting.  She also failed to notice that he would come home wash the dishes do the laundry cook dinner do the kids homework with them and tuck them in bed and had been doing so for weeks.  carla had been so into that phone she didn't even notice the news.  nine p m jack put the movie on for kids and said he was going for pizza and soda and ice cream.  \"'I want sherbet, Dad,' said the daughter, the oldest.  \"'I want strawberry cream,' said the son, the  youngest.\".  then i'll have to go all the way to johnson's grocery store.  don't burn down the house while i'm gone thirty minutes.  he was in the hotel lobby.  he dialed his wife's celly.  she didn't pick up.  he went to the front desk and asked to be connected to timothy's in room at ten a timmy tim came on the line.  send my wife down please.  Timmy Tim pretended to have no idea who it was on the line, although they had been friends for over 15 years.  Okay, I'll just have Mrs.  Timothy come down here.  I'm sure she'd be happy to find out what's going on.  You have five minutes to send my wife down.  Two minutes, out pops Carla from the elevator.  She's white as a ghost.  I ran into Timmy Tim on the way to the spa, she said.  Right.  Sit down.  Here's screenshots of your conversations for the past two months.  If I push this button, your job, your church, your parents, and all of your friends get them.  And so does Timmy Tim's wife.  Here's a contract for you to sign agreeing for you to leave immediately from the house and leave the kids who will stay at the home too.  I'll agree to go to marriage counseling and maybe, just maybe, we can work this out.  Here is half of the money so that you can move out and get you a place to stay.  Carla signed the contract and kept a copy.  She stood there crying in the middle of the lobby as Jack left.  jack wasn't done not by a long shot.  movers actually came over the next day to get carla's stuff for the next three months.  carla would visit on the weekends eat dinner with the kids prepared by jack of course and they'd go to marriage counseling once a week.  he kept saying he needed time to deal with this and maybe maybe this could work out.  jack started seeing a therapist of his own who said he had ptsd.  he took this to his job and reduced his hours to part-time.  jack started leaving magazines around the house open to how to deal with a cheating wife.  The iPad was open to how to move on from infidelity.  The kids found these lying around the house.  Finally, the oldest daughter came to him and said, What did Mommy do?  Don't worry, honey.  It has nothing to do with you.  Do you want ice cream or sherbet?  For about a week, the kids would enjoy a bowl of sherbet or ice cream while talking about how their day went.  Clearly, the daughter understood what was going on, and she wanted to get closer to her dad to know that he wasn't going anywhere.  Six months later, the marriage counseling just wasn't working out.  He served Carla papers for divorce.  Three things happened during the divorce.  Jack had been the primary caregiver for a year by that time, and the kids begged to stay with dear old dad.  Carla had moved out for almost a year.  Jack was working at half the income of Carla for the past six months, and the therapist's diagnosis that he had PTSD was entered as evidence of abandonment by his wife.  He got full custody, the house, alimony, and child support from Carla.  As a parting gift, Mrs.  Timmy Tim got 50 emails of the messenger screenshots when Carla's paperwork was finally signed.  For the next two years, Mrs.  Timmy Tim destroyed Carla's life.  Her reputation was ruined at her job.  Her family abandoned her.  and her friends couldn't believe it.  But coming from the wife of Mrs.  Timmy Tim, they couldn't argue with it.  When the alimony and child support stopped coming to Jack, he had Carla picked up and thrown in jail.  Timmy Tim, on the other hand, lost his house custody to his children and had to pay alimony and child support to his own wife.  Thank you.  Thank you. ",
