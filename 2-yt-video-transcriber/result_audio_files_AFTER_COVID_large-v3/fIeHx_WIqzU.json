Good news, everybody.  everybody clap your hands.  everybody clap your hands.  disney purging star wars marvel woke agenda.  there is no way this can be true but let's all just take eight minutes smash like leave a comment.  let's pretend like this is actually happening With Star Wars failing, I don't know, Star Wars is not doing as well as probably Disney wants.  You got to remember these super huge corporations.  It's not about making money.  It's about making all the money.  And fears surrounding lockdown causing the company to lose billions.  It is claimed that Disney will be changing its approach to various franchises, including Star Wars and Marvel.  It's no secret that Disney is promoting a, quote, woke agenda in its movies more and more.  I don't know necessarily if it's in the movie so much.  If it is, it's pretty... It's not necessarily on the nose, or maybe it's in some of the films that I haven't seen.  It's more so in their casting choices, I think, and the press that they do around it.  I guess there is The Last Jedi.  I take it all back.  star wars is a complete disaster.  i'd agree with that at disney and it has been in decline proven by investor reports since the release of ryan johnson and kathleen kennedy's star wars the last jedi which caused fans to bail on star wars in droves.  yeah i mean of course it did right.  of course Now, most casual Star Wars fans didn't really have a huge problem with it, but the longtime fans did not care for it.  Regarding Marvel, on the movie side, there have been problems with Brie Larson.  And we can argue that even though Captain Marvel was a success, similar to The Last Jedi, it was another woke approach which failed as the writing and directing teams are not back for the sequel.  And perhaps the biggest proof Captain Marvel was a failure is that Kevin Feige has apparently downgraded Brie Larson at Marvel and is now promoting Elizabeth Olsen.  Not Brie!  Not Bree.  Please not Bree.  Bree, don't do this to me, Kevin Feige.  Don't you do it to me.  Seriously.  I'm going to be very angry.  Oh, it says Scarlet Witch and Olsen are liked by the fans a lot more than Brie Larson and Carol Danvers.  That's true.  Everyone loves Elizabeth Olsen, at least right now, until some old award ceremony speech gets brought up, and then we have problems.  so as the woke agenda hasn't been a success at disney and all of hollywood it is claimed that disney is going to purge all the scws and cater to the fans.  this seems too good to be true.  the info comes from the future rule of the earth.  overlord dvd now overlord youtube.  sorry excellent youtube channel really cool uh character and he's been right lot.  he basically got everything right about the rise of Skywalker.  he basically has been right many many times as you know with Star Wars stuff.  now who's been providing information how Star Wars will get fixed and previously real information about problems with Brie Larson and Captain Marvel.  okay Quote, Hollywood is indeed a woke wasteland.  now, and out of that wasteland, a new hope has suddenly appeared.  YouTuber does note that the information does sound too good to be true, but the info comes from a high-level source.  Quote, according to the source that has been reliable in the past, the stuff that is about to hit the fan at Disney, says Doomcock.  I am told that getting the SCWs out of Disney is now priority one, mandated by the sudden realization that sometimes cliches are cliches for a reason and a new understanding at the highest level that you get woke, go broke.  Whoa, he said it!  He said it!  is no longer just a slogan.  yes you heard me right.  as incredible as it sounds my source boldly claims that disney is now only concerned with one thing profitability.  well i can't imagine a time in which they weren't.  the only way this is true is if get woke go broke actually financially tracks, which in some cases it doesn't.  There are absolutely companies like Ben & Jerry's that it doesn't seem to affect their sales, if anything, probably in a positive way.  But there are absolutely other cases where it affects things negatively.  He continues, The proclamation is about to be sent out on high to every corner of the Enchanted Kingdom.  Disney is a for-profit business moving forward, and from here on out, The customer comes first.  The woke party is over because the mouse is awakened with a terrible hangover and it's a new day at Disney.  My source tells me that a huge policy changes are about to be made at Disney.  Bad-mouthing fans, no matter what they say or what side they're on, will no longer be tolerated.  Wow.  I mean, look.  I don't have any problem with... big-name actors punching down to address a particular hater or a comment or something.  They should be able to do that.  It's these blanket statements about toxic fans and this and that that turns off people in droves.  If it were me, I would probably have a company policy that says, no, you cannot engage with customers because it always looks bad.  Engage with them in a negative light.  But I understand the inclination to that.  No matter what is said or no one will be and will no longer be tolerated.  That goes for everyone that works at Disney, including Brie Larson, including the Lucasfilm Story Group and everyone that Kathleen Kennedy has hired.  He goes on to give an example of people at Disney attacking fans, including Rian Johnson, Kathleen Kennedy and Brie Larson and Tiki Taika Waititi.  I have been told explicitly that even someone like Brie Larson will no longer be able to work at Disney if she takes shots at fans.  The slack attitude and tacit support implied by silence that emboldened these woke wonders to hijack a corporate message and subvert corporate profits is no more.  The Lucasfilm story group will no longer be empowered to humiliate Luke Skywalker or. ",
