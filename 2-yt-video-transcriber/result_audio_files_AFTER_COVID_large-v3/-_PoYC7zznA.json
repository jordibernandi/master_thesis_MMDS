            "text": "Hey everyone and welcome.  In this video we look at a recent express poll that shows 94% want to walk away from negotiations and leave on a WTO basis from Europe.  I know polls are trash, but this will prove, hopefully, to Boris and the not-so-extreme hard-left Tories, that we have not given up, not surrendered, and are 100% still anti-European Union.  Our will has not diminished.  The article is titled, Walk away now, 94% want Boris Johnson to abandon pointless Brexit talks.  A staggering 94% of Express readers want Boris Johnson to walk away from trade talks with the EU immediately.  Now we all knew this already, didn't we?  Now they do too, hopefully.  But let's read the rest of the article.  After meeting French President Emmanuel Macron this week, the traitor, if you don't know what that was, he was all nicey-nicey until he left the country and then he tried calling us names.  Yep, this is the weasel that he is.  Couldn't do it to our face, could you Macron?  You wimp.  Mr Johnson insisted it did not make sense to extend talks into the autumn.  The Prime Minister has stated his belief a deal could be reached by the end of the month if both sides increase the pace of negotiations.  While both sides have agreed to speed up talks in pursuit of the deal, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has once again stated Brussels will not back down on its demand over fair competitions.  Well, you won't be getting anything then, which is probably why this poll has gone to 94%.  You moron.  In light of the EU's demand for the UK to be tied to certain regulations.  The Express asked readers, should Boris Johnson walk away from trade talks with the EU now?  In response, an astonishing 6,697 out of 7,073 vote, 94% insisted Mr Johnson should walk away from talks.  In contrast, just 351 said he shouldn't, while 25 were not sure.  Commenting on the poll, one reader said, And we're all in firm agreement with that one, aren't we everyone?  Another said they won't deal until last minute.  so save time and walk away then see what they offer at the last minute.  Good good idea in my opinion.  They will leave it.  I actually think we'd probably be better to just leave on WTO and watch them come crawling to us very very quickly with any deal that we want at that point.  A third said, Should have walked away weeks ago, but today is as good as any.  Another said, Both sides have identified red lines.  they will not cross.  The talks are over.  It's no deal.  We'll be trading under WTO rules and taking back control of our fisheries.  Yep.  A level playing field is whereby businesses agree to certain rules and regulations so that one state does not undercut the other.  The issue is one of the biggest areas of diversions between the two sides.  I do not want a level playing field in any way, shape or form.  I want to compete with the EU.  They've taken all of our industry by giving grants and stuff to get them to move to the European mainland.  They deserve everything they get, in my opinion.  But what say you?  Commenting on the issue, Miss Vonda lay on her back, said, It cannot be a downward competition.  It will be for you.  Just think of labour standards or environmental protection.  Our labour standards and environmental protection are both better than the EU.  Just saying.  This is a massive lie that the left try and pull every single time.  All of our rights are better than the EU's.  Where do you think they got most of the models from?  It should be shared interest for the European Union and the UK to never slide backwards and always advance together towards higher standards.  Well, maybe you should catch up to us then, EU.  The EU also wants to include a punishment mechanism within the agreement.  Punishment?  How dare you?  I tell you what, try and get Billy Big Balls and see what happens after we've left, you muppets.  This is the problem with the EU.  Their power, Hungary... And they are bullies.  This is what their main problem is.  They are absolute bullies.  They think they can threaten countries into submission.  Well, guess what?  This country's not for turning EU.  If this were included, any violation of the agreement would allow either side to retaliate by suspending a part of the relationship, which is why we shouldn't have any relationship.  The EU Commission President added, It is central for our business and our private citizens, both in the UK and the European Union.  No, you mean it's central for your bank balance, isn't it?  And for your continued existence.  It is crucial to ensure that what has been agreed is actually done.  Number 10 has rejected this and insists instead wants a series of separate sectorial agreements.  Now, what's my opinion on this?  I think they're just continuing to try the bully tactics.  I actually do believe the 94% are actually correct.  We should leave right this minute.  No more waiting, no more anything.  Just phone them up now and just say, all right, Von Der Leyen, you want to continue with your threats?  Piss off, you're getting nothing and you won't get anything after either.  Don't even bother coming crawling to us for any money in the future you absolute bully.  I'm hoping that this gives Boris a bit of a kick up the backside because I was honest earlier on when I called them not so extreme hard left Tories because that's exactly what they seem to be.  It seems to be everything I would have classed as conservative, the Tories no longer are, which is why I call them Tories and not conservatives anymore.  But let me know what you think, everyone.  I'd like to know your opinion.  I know everyone wants to leave still, so I don't want to know that.  But I want to know, do you think Boris will take this as a hint to leave now?  Do you think he actually will, is what I want to know.  If you're new to this channel, don't forget to hit the like, comment, subscribe.  Share it out, everyone.
