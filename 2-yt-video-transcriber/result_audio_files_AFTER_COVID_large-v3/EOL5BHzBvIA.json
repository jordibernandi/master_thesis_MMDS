            "text": "Ghostbusters is good, actually.  All the Ghostbusters movies, in fact.  The 1984 classic, of course, the underrated sequel, Don't At Me, but specifically the 2016 Ghostbusters.  Even more specifically, the extended cut of the 2016 Ghostbusters.  Not that chopped to bits theatrical cut, Paul Feig made a movie that ran over two hours and Sony found that unacceptable.  Studios and exhibitors prefer movies to be short so that they can squeeze in as many showings per day as possible and maximize profits.  Speaking as someone who goes to the movies all the time, I have a hard time understanding this logic.  It presumes that tickets to screenings sell out all the time, and if there is no other screening, moviegoers will turn around and go home.  I go to movies on opening night, and the theater is almost never sold out unless it's for Star Wars or a Marvel movie.  Any other movie should probably just be edited to be the best possible version of the movie and not the shortest possible version of the movie.  The theatrical cut of Ghostbusters is\u2026 fine.  It's fine.  But it's clearly missing pieces that the writers and director wanted in.  The extended cut, released on Blu-ray and some streaming services, completes the film.  Aaron and Abby get more character beats and chemistry, particularly the end of the film.  that concludes their shared arc about becoming friends again.  Kevin gets more screen time, and he's one of the best parts of either cut, so that's a good thing.  The strangely missing dance sequence from the theatrical cut is restored in the extended cut.  Basically, the extended cut is the complete and finished version of the movie in the same way that the ultimate cut of Batman v Superman is the complete and finished version of that movie, or how the Blade Runner theatrical cut is not even considered the real version of the movie anymore.  Certainly not the version that's available.  If you have only seen the theatrical version of Ghostbusters 2016 and you're basing your opinion of Ghostbusters on that, or you haven't seen either version and you're basing your opinion on Ghostbusters on takedown videos on YouTube, I urge you to watch the extended cut before continuing.  I think it's on Amazon Prime.  It's the one that runs 2 hours and 13 minutes, not the short one.  I'll wait.  Okay, glad we're all caught up.  Ghostbusters is good, actually.  Ghostbusters begins with Dr.  Erin Gilbert being given the big haul to make a big presentation.  She's up for tenure.  Everything in her whole life has been leading up to this moment when, uh, she is outed as the co-author of a book about ghosts that she wrote when she was young.  She finds the co-author, her former best friend, Dr.  Abigail Yates.  who has never given up on the prospect of busting a ghost, presumably under the hypothesis that Bustin will make her feel good.  Abby works with Dr.  Jillian Holtzman, the best character.  Aaron tries to get Abby to stop selling the book and agrees to investigate a haunted house as part of this deal, and then a ghost throws up real good all over Aaron.  Ghosts are real. ",

            "text": "Ghosts are real!  I believe in Ghosts!  The Ghostbusters meet Patricia Tolan, an expert on the city, hire a secretary named Kevin, the second best character, and discover that some nerd named Rowan is trying to destroy the barrier between our world and the ghost world because he's a weirdo and everyone picks on him and girls don't like him.  He basically spends all his time on Reddit.  The Ghostbusters have a series of encounters with him and the ghosts that he's letting through the barrier.  The Ghostbusters win.  Who you gonna call?  Aaron and Abby have great chemistry throughout the film.  They are initially antagonistic, slowly becoming closer and renewing their childhood bond, occasionally squabbling, but eventually Aaron jumps into a pit to the ghost world to save Abby, and it's just beautiful.  The humor is where the movie either makes or breaks for audiences.  if you love rapid-fire jokes on jokes on jokes mixed with intentional cringe awkwardness stirred around with some old-school physical comedy all of which is safe for the consumption of children then this is the movie for you or at least for your children and if not you probably hated this.  I can't convince you that something that did not make you laugh is actually funny because humor does not work that way.  Explaining something does not make you start laughing at it.  But I will try to explain why so many other people did enjoy Ghostbusters and also why you and me, the adults in the room, were not really the target audience anyway.  The aesthetic of Ghostbusters is this combination of ethereal and otherworldly mixed with bright, almost neon colors.  Many of the ghosts are not fully CG, but instead are actors with visual effects added onto them, much like the librarian ghost from the original Ghostbusters played by Ruth Hale Oliver.  The scene with Gertrude Aldrich, played by Bess Rouse, has a great misdirect where she glides in peacefully, Abby says she's beautiful, and then she suddenly spews ectoplasm all over Aaron.  A Ghostbusters tradition.  The further along into the film, the more we see inhuman ghosts, giant monsters, and slimers, and other various Class V vapors.  The neon glow of the film exists even outside scenes with the ghosts, as the movie contains a consistent aesthetic.  When the Ghostbusters take on the biggest and baddest ghosts in New York, the transition from real city to CG green screen feels seamless.  Maybe the illusion of real and computer generated and the difficulty differentiating between the two explains why some fans remarked that they hated the ghost design in the trailer, dubbing it only CG, not realizing that actual actors were used for the ghosts.  But much like in the original, humanizing the main antagonist makes for a more personal battle as opposed to just slaying a giant.  The primary antagonist of Ghostbusters is Rowan, a basement-dwelling shut-in who believes he speaks for the downtrodden.  To that end, he plans to rip a hole in reality and it's up to the Ghostbusters to stop him.  Rowan is the most 2016 antagonist imaginable.  He is perfect.  He is exactly the right foil for the modern world.  Someone who mistakenly believes he is part of a marginalized group and has an inverted understanding of why he is a loser.  Rowan thinks that people, apropos of nothing, treat him like a creep and that makes him a victim whereas Rowan simply is a creep and wishes to victimize others.  Rowan is played by Neal Casey throughout much of the film, but then he is played by Melissa McCarthy once Abby is possessed, and then by Chris Hemsworth when Kevin is possessed.  Hemsworth gets to play two roles in the movie, and he shines in both of them.  Once Rowan possesses Kevin, the real fun begins.  The dance-off, the overconfidence.  Rowan mocking the Ghostbusters by transforming into their logo was a nice touch.  It's a shame there is no sequel forthcoming because the movie's sequel baiting an encounter with Zool was a great to-be-continued that, unfortunately, will never be continued.  If there is one aspect of Ghostbusters that is almost universally agreed upon, it's that Holtzman is the best character.  A mad scientist who makes the proton packs, ghost traps, and various other new toys for the Ghostbusters to play with.  She's a ball of energy and she has, by far, the best action scene in the film as she annihilates the ghosts with her proton pistols and whips and she's just great.  Speaking of her toys, all the additions to the Ghostbusters arsenal really should be enough to excite die-hard ghost heads who have been waiting their whole lives for new stuff for their collections.  As much as the Ghostbusters are the stars of the movie, it's hard to imagine this film without Kevin.  He is given a lot of the best lines and gags, like Kevin asking to choose between two headshots of him with a saxophone, the ghost hot dog, Michael hat.  Ghostbusters fans liken him to Janine, the secretary from the original film, but Kevin far more resembles Lewis Tully, a bumbling but good-natured man who wants to be a Ghostbuster and ends up controlled by the antagonist.  Kevin tries so hard, except all the times when he doesn't try at all.  It's hard not to love him, and he is one of the highlights of the film.  Also, he has strong pocket square game.  Respect.  Sigh.  And now, the common complaints about this movie.  Alright, let's get this part over with.  I don't like the editing.  Once again, this is a reasonable complaint, but only for the theatrical version that does not really exist anymore, except on Hulu, I think.  The complete version of the film runs 2 hours and 13 minutes, and if you're basing your dislike of the movie on a different version, I strongly recommend seeking this out.  Why didn't they call it something else besides Ghostbusters?  Because it's 2016 and even more.  today, almost every movie with a big budget is from a pre-existing intellectual property.  Studios make fewer movies with bigger budgets, which makes them even more adverse to risk than before.  Studios aren't going to make a big-budget comedy about ghosts and not have it be Ghostbusters.  This is not a Ghostbusters problem, it's just the 21st century.  Everyone hated it.  No, it was critically well received and audience reaction was split down the middle.  One might be led to believe everyone hated it because the complaints are always louder than praise and the internet can form a kind of social bubble, an echo chamber of opinions among like-minded people.  Women's.  I won't dignify this with a response.  It bombed at the box office.  That's true.  And?  Is that how we're judging movies now?  Whether or not they made their money back at the theaters?  We're movie fans, not studio executives.  That really shouldn't matter to us in terms of whether or not a movie is a quality picture or not.  If we do, that means that any film that was not a success in theaters is also bad.  Children of Men, The Iron Giant, Mulholland Drive, The Shawshank Redemption, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, and Citizen Kane, to name a few.  Unless we're prepared to start judging movies based on their receipts, this is probably an argument we should abandon.  30-something fans declare, these aren't my Ghostbusters, with the same righteous indignation that someone uses when saying, he's not my president.  To those fans, let this be clear.  You are indeed correct, though not for the reason you believe.  This isn't your Ghostbusters movie.  It's theirs.  The children and adolescents growing up now.  In the 1980s, the Ghostbusters were formative for you.  They were your heroes.  Their humor and sensibilities were relative to the time period.  This is also true of the 2016 Ghostbusters.  That may be part of why you don't like it.  It's not really humor for people who grew up in the 80s.  It's humor for the children of people who grew up in the 80s.  It's not for children who lived under Ronald Reagan.  It's for children who were living under Barack Obama.  If you grew up in the 80s and 90s watching Ghostbusters movies and cartoons, then those were your Ghostbusters.  But Ghostbusters is not just for you anymore.  It's for them.  Do you think that the new Ghostbusters just doesn't have enough of that 80s cynicism about it and that it's too light-hearted?  Well, yeah.  Because it's for kids.  Do you think the new Ghostbusters looks too much like Scooby-Doo?  Yeah, it kind of does.  Because it's for kids.  It's why this movie won Best Picture at the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards, because it's a movie for kids, and the kids liked it.  Now, it's not only a movie for kids.  I mean, I liked it too, but definitely it had them in mind more than myself.  sure the studio undoubtedly wanted everyone's dollar at the box office including older fans curious about their childhood franchise but this was clearly made and rated for families to take their children and buy the toys and other merchandise.  The original Ghostbusters was crude and adult, but it was also rated PG.  It was a hit with children, even if a handful of scenes were not really appropriate for them.  Proton packs lined the shelves at Toys R Us in the 80s.  Cartoons were made.  Children bought the toys.  They wore the costumes on Halloween.  They memorized the lines from the movie and played make-believe with their friends and argued over who got to be Venkman.  And now it's their turn.  Part of growing up is passing what you had to the next generation and recognizing that the world is not marketing some things to you anymore.  That does not mean you can't enjoy media for youngsters.  That does not mean you can't collect the toys.  That does not mean watching media for children is itself childish.  But there is a difference between watching media for youngsters and claiming that media as your own.  Holding onto Ghostbusters as if it were still mostly yours is insisting on not passing down your toys to your children, either literally if you have your own children or figuratively if you do not.  You're right, this is not your Ghostbusters movie, and that's okay.  It's time to let the children play with your toys.  I love the proton pack and the outfit. ",
