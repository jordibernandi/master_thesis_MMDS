            "text": "You know, we've done some videos reacting to me giving my reviews of some hit rap songs, some joints that are truly, if I could just say, fire.  Songs that when you listen to them, they make you, as the kids might say, make you want to cut a rug, even do the hokey pokey.  But today, I want to switch it up a little bit.  I happen to see an article about a pop song that's lighting up the charts, a huge hit.  It's number one, smash hit.  Everyone's listening to it.  Everyone's talking about it.  They're not talking about it to me, personally, because I'm, you know, a loser.  But I hear them talk.  When I'm sulking alone by myself in the corner, I hear people talking about it.  So it's a big deal.  It's a song by a girl named Olivia Rodrigo, and it's called Driver's License.  Wikipedia tells me that Olivia Rodrigo is an American actress and singer who's known for her roles as Paige Olvera on the Disney Channel series Bizarre Bark.  What?  Sounds like a medical condition.  I have no idea what bazaardvark is.  I am so many levels of out of touch.  But even when you start, I don't recognize a name, and you start explaining it to me by telling me, oh, they're on this TV show.  I don't know what that is either.  Oh, you know, the show with this other person is on this other show over here.  I don't know what that is.  Oh, they're on this TV.  I don't know what a TV is.  We sit around a radio the size of a refrigerator at my house, and we listen to murder mysteries at night.  That's still where we're at, 1932.  But anyway, this one is, like I said, what I'm told is a big hit.  Driver's License is what it's called.  Let's take a listen and just give it a shot.  Let's give this song a shot.  Let's listen to it. ",

            "text": "Okay, you know, see, I have to say it.  And I don't mean this in an offensive way at all.  But This is why we need to rethink allowing women to have driver's license.  And like I said, I don't mean that misogynistically, just rethink driver's license and also voting, but not in a sexist way at all.  This girl is, by her own admission, driving and she's crying, distraught, and she's going through the suburbs, we're talking residential areas, and she's speeding down the road, hysterical, bawling her eyes out.  This is how somebody gets killed.  I mean, how many pedestrians have been flattened like pancakes by teenage girls driving around crying because their boyfriends broke up with them?  This is a it's too many to count.  This is an epidemic.  Nobody talks about it.  Maybe the song is meant to raise awareness of the problem.  I don't know.  And also, by the way, what kind of teenager is this depressed after getting their driver's license?  Here you are already depressed.  aimlessly driving around forlorn stewing on the fundamental misery of existence and you just got your driver's license last week.  you know you shouldn't start doing that until you're at least like 25. i didn't have my first existential crisis in a car until this past month and i'm 34. so she's uh way ahead of the curve.  but let's uh let's let's keep listening.

I can't take the relationship struggles of teenagers seriously.  I just can't.  Because no relationship you have at this age means anything.  I got news for you.  None of it does.  Even your friends.  None of it means anything.  It doesn't matter.  I'm sorry.  No, you guys didn't really love each other.  You didn't.  You were infatuated briefly.  You're going to move on with your life.  You won't even remember this person a few years from now.  You won't remember them.  This is maybe my problem with pop music is that I can't listen to songs, I can't listen to somebody sing about heartbreak unless they're old and grizzled and ugly like me.  I can only take you seriously on that subject if you're like that.  Your marriage falls apart, you have kids, you got a mortgage, you got back problems.  You know, you're out of shape.  You're overweight.  How are you going to meet somebody else?  I could take that seriously.  Now, that's something.  That's worth a song or two.  You know, you could be excused for even driving through the suburbs weeping.  I'll give you a couple of those episodes, too.  But, you know, your dumb boyfriend you met in October broke up with you after Thanksgiving.  Give me a break.  Snap out of it.  You're embarrassing yourself.  And I know we weren't perfect but I've never felt this way for no one And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone. ",

And yeah, I know he said forever.  I know he did.  He's a junior in high school.  For him, forever means like until fifth period, okay?  Now, all right, let's listen to this girl complain some more.

            "text": "Okay.  Yeah, Olivia, listen.  I don't know what to tell you.  This guy said he loved you, but he didn't.  And here's the thing.  Here's the part you'll learn when you get older.  You didn't really love him either.  So he did you a favor.  You have to understand the difference between emotional codependence and actual love.  And that's a confusion.  that explains much of pop music.  And if not for that confusion, we would be spared.  almost the entire pop industry.  Love is not a feeling.  Love is an act.  It's a choice that you make.  It's the giving of the self to another.  It's sacrifice is what it is.  It's work.  Thomas Aquinas, as I'm sure you know, he said that love is to will the good of another.  Think about that, to will the good of another.  Now, this kind of love that you two had, it was too self-involved.  It was too self-interested to be true love.  Even now, everything you're saying It's all about how he made you feel, how you feel now.  But you're singing about someone else, but all I hear is I, I, I, me, me, me.  Your love of the other is really the love of self.  You haven't matured to the point, it's okay, because you're still young, but you haven't matured to the point of being able to truly reach out and love somebody else.  That's the problem.  And that's why I say that kids should not be dating or making pop music.  You shouldn't date until you're 23.  That's the rule in my house.  I've just decided it.  You know, right now at this age, you should be, you could be doing other things with your time, constructive things.  You could go, you know, go climb a tree, build a diorama, start a kickball league, sign up for one of those, you know, one of those programs where they give you a pen pal in a foreign country.  These are the things you should be doing at your age, okay?  Good.  Glad we could have this talk.  Now, chin up, sport.  It's going to be okay.  And nice job on the song.  You have a good voice.  Your mom and I are very proud of you. ",
