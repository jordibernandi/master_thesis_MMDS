            "text": "I get asked a lot about how to be sexy, or more often, how to be sexually confident in bed.  I've also received DMs from some of my female OnlyFans subscribers who ask me how I look so comfortable doing what I'm doing, or who say that my pages help them become more confident.  That last word is key and I've gotta give major credit to a high school friend who told me shortly before I lost my virginity that I should never be embarrassed about myself or my body around someone who wants to have sex with me.  I worried about being fat and she told me that any man who made me feel anxiety or shame about my body should go fuck themselves.  So I opened the door for my high school lover wearing absolutely nothing and his positively stunned reaction and her sage advice has shaped my sexual experiences ever since.  I may not be sexy to everyone, but that doesn't matter.  Sex appeal is subjective, but nobody can deny your confidence when you have it in truckloads.  And confidence is sexy.  I'm confident, I'm unapologetic, and to be with me is a privilege.  With that being said, here's my five tips for any woman who wants to be more sexually confident.  If the thought of sex causes you anxiety because you're nervous about the... I need you to move.  Will you move?  Bye.  If the thought of sex causes you anxiety because you're nervous about the ability to cum, the solution is simple.  You need to masturbate more.  You can't expect others to make you cum if you can't do it yourself.  Masturbating allows you to explore your own body, learn its crevices, and understand what makes you cum.  You pass this knowledge along to your sexual partner or partners and reap the benefits.  Take your masturbation sessions to the next level by recording snippets and listening or watching yourself cum.  The next time you're having sex and having trouble getting comfortable enough to let your guard down, think back to the carefree orgasms you have when masturbating.  Were your fingers on your clit?  Were you biting your lip?  Incorporate whatever it was into the sex you're having and enjoy.  I'm so serious.  If this wasn't YouTube, I'd be buck naked right now.  I never feel self-conscious about my body.  I've got huge breasts and a big ass with crazy big thighs and a stomach that is only flat when it wants to be.  I love being naked in front of my paying customers online and I enjoy being fully unclothed during sex.  Why?  I enjoy being fully unclothed in most situations.  I eat naked, clean naked, cook naked, sans when I'm frying chicken, and generally walk around the house doing nothing but ass naked.  Nudity is so normalized to me that I only remember that I'm naked when I walk past a mirror, and when I do, I'm so turned on by the sight that I sometimes dip off to masturbate.  The point of being nude more often is to become comfortable with your body.  Your lines, indentations, scars, moles, cellulite, et cetera, are not scary or unnatural, except that your body is beautiful, flaws and all.  Love it because it's the only one you have, and require the people you hook up with to see its value.  They can't touch you without first understanding that it's a privilege.  When they do touch you, accept such activity as a form of worship.  You're a goddess.  Performance would imply that the main goal of your sexual encounter is to entertain someone else.  I'm gonna say what you're not supposed to say.  Your sexual joy should come first.  Instead of performing, simply enjoy.  Most people find a woman who is in tune with her sexuality arousing.  Enjoying the sex naturally instead of thinking in your head about when to moan, when to grab his back, when to say his name, will make everything much more natural and fun.  Don't moan because you think you're supposed to.  In fact, if you moan because you don't want him to think he's not satisfying you, definitely stop moaning and pick up tip number five.  He'll appreciate your genuine reactions and you'll enjoy sex without a checklist of performance actions.  If you watch a lot of porn and also have sex anxiety about the way your vagina or body looks or how you sound when you cum, you may want to stop watching so much porn.  Yes, I'm an OnlyFans girl, and yes, I just said that.  While porn is great for giving new sex position ideas or helping you visualize your nastiest fantasies, it also subconsciously influences how you see your own body and expect for it to look during sex.  Porn is filmed from professional angles to highlight the best aspects of an actress's body.  Real sex includes less angles and more rolls, bumps, freckles, and random patches of body hair.  Real sex isn't edited to show only the most attractive parts of your body.  Real sex shouldn't be an edited performance.  Again, let it be natural.  Your boo is enjoying your body and you should be enjoying theirs.  Don't worry about your titty sliding sideways to your armpit or the little bit of labia that doesn't exist on your favorite porn star.  If you love your porn and don't want to take such drastic measures as skipping it completely, find porn stars and amateur content creators with similar body types to yours and enjoy their content.  If something is plaguing you, you should be able to talk to your partner about it.  Usually your fears are irrational and something they'll probably laugh at because you're sexier and more appealing than you realize.  They should soothe your fears and then fuck the shit out of you.  Your partner's attraction to you and your body will only reinforce your confidence.  However, if there is something that he brings valid attention to, like your vagina smelling a little fishy, perhaps you should go to the gynecologist and see what's up.  Also, make sure he's brushing his teeth and washing his hands and penis before pleasuring you so that he's not the cause of said fishiness.  If he tells you that your writing skills or something of that nature could use a little work, tell him that you want to practice more.  What partner would say no to you using them for practice?  But also, a key component of your sexual confidence growing exponentially as you age is being sexually satisfied.  To be sexually satisfied, it usually helps to have an open communication with your partner.  Don't assume that your partner should know what your preferences are.  For instance, I love having my nipples sucked and bitten so hard that they become sore.  Anything less is completely pointless for me.  Now, how would any lover know this unless I told them?  If you're old enough to be having sex, you're old enough to voice your needs to your partner.  Be willing to guide and be willing to take control during sex if things aren't going your way.  You'll have better orgasms and your confidence will grow.  This means taking control sometimes and speaking up about what you do and don't like.  Lastly, I just wanna tell every woman watching this that you deserve pleasure, joy, and adoration, no matter your sexual past, your abortions, your looks, your occupation, your income, your baggage, et cetera.  Treat yourself like a goddess in all facets of your life and demand respect from the people you welcome into your bed.  Nobody is doing you a favor by finding you sexually attractive.
