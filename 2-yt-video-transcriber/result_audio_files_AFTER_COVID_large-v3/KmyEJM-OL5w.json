            "text": "yes February the 20th 2020. it's a wow it's a very important day.  yes okay I am so excited to give you this information on this very very important day and it's 943 p.m.  in Salem Indiana.  I've been seeing this right here.  If we look at this over here, we see this right here on 220 okay to 2018. it's on this side of the Sun and it's been on this side of the Sun for a long time.  but back in 2009 I was stumbled upon this.  it's on this side of the Sun and I was able to get a good screenshot of this and I worked the picture.  and this is actually let's zoom up on this I am I am telling you I'm so excited.  I am beyond excited.  I really am.  this right here is a docking station.  there are ships that are docked on here And guess what type of ships they are?  They are the ships that I have been documenting, the ships that I have been sharing since 2018.  Yeah, so I was totally floored when I found this out.  Of course, we have a ship up there too.  This is, yeah, there's so much of this right here going on.  We also got another great big ship that comes in over here, but I'm focusing on this right here.  It's a docking station, and it has the same type of ships that I've been sharing with you all.  And you may say, how is this possible?  You only use an iPhone 8 and a clip-on lens?  It's possible.  It is possible, and we're going to get to that.  I'm going to pause this.  I'm going to show you some of the screenshots that I took of this.  I want to start with showing you a screenshot of where we've been seeing it and we've been seeing it right here on this side of the stereo ahead core 2.  Okay, this is where we've been seeing it right here and it never goes away.  This is a black and white image and I'm going to pause this and I'm going to show you the red image of this.  Okay, we're looking at the current.  This is the current stereo Ahead Core 2.  You can see it right here.  This is where it's always at right here.  It's been here for quite a while and I've always wondered what it is because it never moves.  So now we're going to pause this video and I'm going to show you some of the screenshots that I've taken.  Okay, so here's one screenshot right here.  You can see it.  It's just setting right there.  I'll buy it.  It's lonesome.  And it's from 2009, which it is a relative at this point.  The date here, it doesn't matter anymore.  Okay.  And this is, I mean, you can hardly see it because the video was whatever.  Just a blink and a blink.  Yeah, hey look, that looks like that ship came out of that one.  But this is another image of it right here.  I'm going to pause this video and I'm going to show you the real good images as soon as I can find it.  So I got this on my, I did a screenshot of it.  We're going to zoom up on this for you.  We can start making out.  You can see some images, some shapes right here.  So I sent this image to my cell phone, to where I have more.  I'm used to using the editing tools over there, so I'll show you what it looked like then.  So you just hold on one moment because I am so excited.  I really am.  This needs to get out there.  I really am.  I just, yes, I love it.  Okay, now we're going to look at the picture.  Look at this.  This is the exact same image.  Look at the notches underneath.  These are ships.  And they're like the ones I've been sharing all the while.  You can still see some notches in them.  Yeah, and down here also.  It's like a docking station.  Well, I'm going to pause this.  We're going to screen this back out.  I'm going to pause this.  Okay, now we're going to look a little closer up.  Look at these notches.  These are like the ships I've been sharing and documenting.  Look at that.  I'm like totally shocked.  I really am Shocked and to see them up there by the Sun Like that, but of course if they're around the Sun, I guess They're gonna be up there, but just look at that.  Mmm.  I just I just don't know what to think about this.  I really don't know what to think about this.  So And again, I did stumble upon this by accident.  I really did.  And what a perfect day to 2020 to share this with you.  It is.  It's perfect.  I love it.  I really do love it.  Let me pause this again.  And again, this is, um, in the inverted mode, you see that it does take the shape of the ships.  Let me see if this.  Yeah.  So this is where it's at.  It's on the stereo head core too.  And I think it's back in 2009 and this just so happened to like have the right amount of light exposed to it.  I like that.  the light exposed, exposed it.  That's what happened.  The light forces exposed it.  I brought it out into the light.  So yeah.  Now granted, this has not been sharpened.  The image has not been sharpened.  But yeah, that's what it is.  This is pretty exciting to me.  It really is.  I'm not joking.  Yeah.  So again, this is what we have.  docking station and of course it's lit up all white and with the red background on the stereo head core 2 or core 1. but this is what is in the light areas right here.  I'm telling you this is I just stumbled upon it.  I picked that day I picked that month I picked that year and um That's exactly how it happened.  And to see the shape of these and the notches.  I just can't tell you how that makes me feel.  I really can't.  I'm kind of speechless.  I really am speechless.  Now I'm going to show you some of the pictures that I've been taking.  Some may be from a year ago.  Yeah, they are from a year ago, maybe two years ago When the ships were coming in.  so I'm gonna just show some briefly.  Okay, you just hold on right there.  Okay, I want to show you this inverted picture right here.  The ships.  it's they're all different types coming out of a large orb or mothership or something.  and Yeah, there's so many.  I think it's time that people start waking up and start taking this more seriously, what we're looking at.  the pictures that I'm sharing and what other people are talking about what other people are sharing the people who are channeling.  I think we need to take this really serious.  we really do.  it's not a joke this.  this is.  it's very important.  okay it's very very very important.  I'm going to show you the original image of that one without the inverted mode.  Okay, we have the image here without it being in the inverted mode.  So you can see these ships a little better.  They're kind of like boats.  They kind of are in the shape of a boat, but yeah.  And they just show up in my pictures with my iPhone 8 and my clip-on lens, and you know, I yeah i'm just smiling while i'm looking at this because this is one of the most coolest pictures right here.  there were so many of them.  uh yeah well let me pause this again.  I'm just going to show you this picture right here and you can see the notches and you know it's hard for me to get up really really close with these since I am here on earth and I'm just using my iPhone 8 but you can see the notches.  you can see that they're all.  there's some pretty long ships here.  They're really long and they can make themselves as long as they want.  I think as tall as they want to do the job that they need to do.  Yeah, but yeah, it's pretty cool.  I love it.  I really love it.  So this was stereo ahead core two.  I think I said core one but it's stereo ahead core two.  you can see there is.  this is a battle formation.  uh that's what this is because they are all uh around this like this look a battle formation.  that is what this was and this is 2009. but you can see here's the um The docking station right here where the ships would be And I do think that maybe they were under attack or something.  who knows what was going on but I'm gonna pause right here.  So this is the That little curve.  And now we know what it is.  It's a docking station, a space station.  And I will now put the pictures together.  And thank you all for watching this.  I really appreciate it. ",
