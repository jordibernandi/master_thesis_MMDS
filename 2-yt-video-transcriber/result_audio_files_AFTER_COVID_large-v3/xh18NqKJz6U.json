I take care of a lot of people.  I'm never letting one woman control of all the hard work I've done in my life.  None of these motherfuckers was in the gym with me, right?  So, I always tell myself, whoever I'm married to, they signing the prenup off top.  It's not even a second guess.  So, man, I had to talk about it.  So, we get the prenup back at least three, four months before the wedding, right?  I give it to her.  Granted, when I give it to her, she shouldn't be surprised by it because me and her sat down and agreed upon the prenup.  A month passed, like two months before the wedding, I'm like, yo, look, we need to get that prenup signed so we can go ahead and send it in and get all that taken care of.  so when we get down to Houston, we ain't gotta worry about it.  I tell her that like two or three times.  It's a month, that was two months before the wedding.  It's a month before the wedding.  She's like, I'ma sign it, I'ma sign it, I'ma sign it.  I'ma sign it, I'ma sign it, I'ma sign it.  I'm like, cool.  You can sign it, but look, During that time, we making arrangements for the wedding, right?  Cause you know, you still got a plan.  So, you know, I love her and I'm gonna keep it real with you.  I was in love with her and we was building a family.  So I'm like, okay, cool.  I ain't gonna make no big deal.  I went with planning a wedding.  I didn't stop.  I kept planning a wedding.  So as we're planning for the wedding, she's from New York.  I'm from Texas.  I'm from Port Arthur, which is an hour from Houston where we get married.  I want my pastor to do it.  He right there.  It'll save us some money.  She is adamant about this certain pastor doing the thing, right?  Some other girl brought the pastor name to her attention.  This is a pastor she's never seen.  So I'm like, cool.  It's her wedding.  I ain't got no problem.  Keep in mind, Remember this pastor, right?  I spent about 400,000 on a wedding, y'all.  About 400K, right?  Now we at two weeks before the wedding.  Everything planned.  We ready to go.  I'm like, look, bro.  Why I got to keep asking you about this prenup, bro?  It ain't like.  you don't know what's on it.  Like, what motives?  This is what I told her.  What you up to?  What motives you on?  I ain't on nothing.  I just ain't had time to sign up for planning a wedding and all this.  I'm like, man, listen, man.  All you got to do is sign it.  This the day of the wedding.  Wake up that morning.  I'm getting dressed.  In the back of my mind, You know what I'm saying?  I'm all thinking about this damn prenup, right?  That's all I'm thinking about.  This is why Steph Marbury and Mike Bibby are my brothers.  All right?  For life.  We in the back.  We walk to the back room.  And the priest come in.  The preacher come in with his assistant, I guess.  And then my nanny come back in there with a spook look on her face like... She still like, she, she pulled me to the side and she like, she still ain't signed it.  Oh, I ain't, no, I ain't getting married.  Steph was like, she ain't signed a prenup.  What the, what we even here for?  I'm like, yeah, dog, I ain't doing it.  The preacher steps up.  He's like, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  He say, now, now, hold on.  Don't, now, I know you love this girl.  Don't make a drastic decision.  I think you should just let God handle it. ",
