And I sound groggy, so fuck it.  Alinity starts trending, literally like 10 minutes ago on Twitter.  And the first thing I think is, oh god, no, please, please, no more thoughts.  I haven't even gone through my other thought stuff.  No, please.  And of course, it's for Alinity's nip slipping out.  Like her full boobage.  This, oh, get out of here.  This clip is funny because I've watched it backwards and forwards looking for secret messages.  I've studied this clip like the Dead Sea Scroll.  And the only thing I can say about it is her facial reaction is the best part of this clip.  It's the best part.  The look on her face when she pulls her boob out.  It's classic.  This is gonna stay with me till the day I die.  This look right here is the greatest moment in Twitch history.  I want this to be an emote on my channel.  Can I do that still?  I want this.  This needs to be an emote.  I probably can't have it.  I know if I make this an emote, Twitch will immediately ban me.  And that's the funny thing.  Elenity's boob being out, the VOD was up for three hours.  She didn't get banned.  I saw some dude on Twitter complaining.  he shook his ass once and got a seven-day ban for sexual content.  The other funny part about this is it looks staged.  It looked like she did that on purpose.  There's no way this chick... Just missed that.  None.  It's impossible.  Lift up your shirt right now.  And do it without pulling your nips out.  Doesn't matter if you're a man or a woman.  You know exactly where that line is.  You know where it is.  The girl's playing.  Alinity is untouchable.  I said it once, I said it twice, I said it a thousand times.  We already know Alinity could pull out a gun and shoot a fucking midget on stream.  And Twitch would be like, This is fine.  This is good content.  This is the sort of stuff we want to represent our site.  I mean, the funniest part is she's got sponsorships.  She's got more than I do.  I got nothing for this.  Twitch just changed their community guidelines.  We've updated the nudity and attire policy in the community guidelines.  Check out our blog to learn more.  And some woman wrote, funny, I didn't realize Susan Wachowski was running Twitch.  Oh, shut up.  This literally came out.  what?  At the beginning of the month, And Alinity already broke the damn guideline before the month was over.  Wasn't even two fucking weeks.  Alinity broke the guideline and she will receive no repercussions.  None.  Guarantee it.  If she gets a ban, it'll be 24 hours.  Also, you go to her Twitch page, she deleted the VOD.  And in Twitch's rules... If a popular female streamer makes a mistake but deletes the VOD, it never happened.  How do I know?  It's been done before.  I got video of some other thought that broke some rules and her boyfriend slash mod slash.  Twitch worker scrubbed her whole channel and nothing happened.  Girl's faker than a Barbie doll, I'll tell you that.  You know who I'm talking about.  Get me out of here.  I'm done with this.  I don't care if it's not 10 minutes.  This doesn't need to be 10 minutes.  It's literally a nip slip.  You can't turn this into 10 damn minutes. ",
