When there's a lot of people walking towards me, it's harder to get people to stop and interview.  It's when there's less people out here, it's easier to get people to stop.  It's kind of fascinating.  Would you have any interesting... I'm interviewing people for my hobby, which is called street epistemology.  It's where you take a claim that someone makes because they think that it's true and then question them in a respectful manner to see how they got there.  How could you actually be so sure that ghosts are real?  How could you actually be so sure that vaccines cause autism?  How could you actually be sure that there's a higher power that is listening to your prayers, for example?  Would you be interested in doing a short interview?  I time it for four minutes. ",

So epistemic justice would be instead of asking white anthropologists about these natives or indigenous people would be actually asking the natives and the indigenous peoples to tell their story and accept it.  as truth.  So for instance, museums house kachina ancestors.  You might see them as kachina dolls.  So within Native American epistemology, those are not dolls and that's disrespectful.  They are Kachina ancestors.  But for indigenous peoples, so and everything has a lifespan.  Nothing is meant to be preserved.  Everything runs its course and dies.
