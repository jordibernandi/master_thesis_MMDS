Like, when I graduated, I had nothing else to do.  And, like, now, I work, like, all the time.  Like, I have three jobs now.  but I have to do that to keep myself busy or else I'll stay home and like sleep all day and be a couch potato.  I take care of my papa cause he has Parkinson's psychosis.  So I don't really wanna leave him alone cause he can't really take care of himself.  that well by himself.  I also am a PCA, a personal care assistant.  So I go and I help seniors.  I kept contact with Michelle.  I mean, she's always there.  So like, of course, I kept in contact.  Like, it'll be like my birthday or something.  She'll be like, happy birthday.  And it'll be the other way around.  Or like, I mean, I even have her on Facebook.  Like, it's great.  I would tell them, you're not alone.  And I hope that this documentary helps you.  Hopefully you have someone, whether it's a friend, family, even someone like online across the country.  If they make you feel better, if it's someone that you can talk to to help you, like AA meetings or anything, you just got to go with it.  Don't fight it.  Going back to school, this is the cool part.  I'm doing EKG classes, EMT classes.  I wanted to do EMS classes, which is emergency services, but I can't due to COVID.  It's more of a hands-on class.  I am working on getting good credit, and I want to buy myself an RV, like an awesome RV.  That's as far as I can think.  Since filming the documentary, I am most proud of myself for graduating and being able to stay sober without going to school.  Because I felt like because we always got drug tested at the school and because I never wanted to disappoint anyone at the school, I always like tried to like stay sober and stuff, but obviously like I fell off a couple times.  Yeah, I was just proud of myself for being able to carry on.  Live your best awesome life.  Sober. ",
