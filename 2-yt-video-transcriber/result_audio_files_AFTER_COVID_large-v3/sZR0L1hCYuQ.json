There's that guy down there too.  There's the second one.  Oh.  There goes the other one again.  Can you believe this?  Oh, there he is.  He's back again.  I can't say hi.  They want a rubberneck.  Look at this cop creeping.  They always run away when they see the camera out.  Oh, there's two of them.  Hmm.  I wonder what he's doing in a dead end.  There's another one down here.  Hmm.  These guys are the absolute worst cops that I've ever encountered in South Jersey.  The other guy just went behind me back the way he came.  I wonder what he's doing.  Let's go up and see.  What is the piggy doing?  There's another one down there too.  Like way past him.  There's that guy down there too.  They're setting up for something.  Oh, there goes the other one again.  Very odd behavior.  Very, very odd behavior.  This guy's on the creep move now that I'm getting closer.  He's moving out of the fire station.  I'm in Gloucester Township, Sicklerville area.  So now he's going to make a left.  No, he changes.  Nope, he's going to make a left.  So he's moving off.  If we go back this way, there might be another one of these guys coming around here.  Yep.  I wonder what they're doing out here.  Very odd.  Very, very odd.  He's going to make his left.  I started approaching.  We'll find a way out when I start approaching.  And here's this guy again.  Can you believe this?  So he goes back there, that way.  I don't see anything going on up there anymore.  no activity up this way anymore.  cop that went to the fire station is tucked behind it somewhere hasn't come back out.  very odd behavior.  Oh, there he is.  He's back again.  Now he's going to make a left turn.  I was wrong the first time.  He made a right, but it was my left.  I don't know what he's doing.  I bet you've never seen a camera in this neighborhood before, huh?  I see.  That's what I'm here for.  When they said you can't come in because of Corona.  We can play this game all day, buddy.  All you have to do is take about 15 or 20 steps forward and then they go away.  But if you didn't have the camera.  Very odd.  How you doing buddy?  Maybe that's the end.  Maybe it isn't.  Oh, never mind.  Damn it.  He wanted more... More video time.  Uh-oh, here it goes.  Pulls over.  This is about... And then you take 10 or 20 steps, like I said, and it kind of rolls away.  And that is unit number 1554.  Hmm.  Very odd.  Very, very odd.  There he goes.  He's at the stop sign.  Pretty much just making people feel weird.  Made that lady feel weird over here.  Made this guy pulling out that you hear the music in the background.  Made him feel weird.  I watch out for these piggies, man.  They're all over the place here.  Man, there he is.  There's the second one.  I wonder what that's about.  That one went off that way.  I wonder.  I can't say hi.  They want a rubberneck.  This has been going on all day since, since I got here.  It's funny.  It looks like I'm sleeping over.  So he'll probably choose the furthest road, which is right where that guy's walking up there.  I don't see him down here, down that street.  So I'm gonna take a hike down this way.  Oh, there's one.  He's going back into the fire station.  Oh, there comes the other guy right here.  Oh, he's doing the same thing again.  Oh, he's avoiding me.  So we have one that went back behind here again.  Guys, this is crazy.  I just don't understand exactly what's going on.  Ever since I got here, this place has been flooded.  So that guy that went down that way and made a left is either going to come through this way or he's going to make his way out to the other main street.  Meanwhile, my whole concern is why are you guys sitting out here intimidating The folks that live here, not cool, not cool.  Here it comes. ",
