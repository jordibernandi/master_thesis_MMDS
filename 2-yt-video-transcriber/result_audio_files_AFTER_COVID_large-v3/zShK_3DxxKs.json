I do not permit a woman to teach or have authority.  Is that two things?  Or is it one thing?  And syntactically, that is according to the way the Greek sentence is put together, it's two things.  But it's pretty close to one thing anyway.  That is, the authority that was exercised in the early church was primarily through the word.  It was not from some hierarchical structure or status.  So it sounds like a church-recognized, word-based authority, what has come to be called a magisterial authority, a teaching authority, which seems to be the limitation that Paul has in mind, and that is in line with other texts that one finds in the New Testament.  To my mind, that's the focus of that. ",

And I did think it was masterful, and I said, oh, here we go.  This is great.  And I like the fact that now here I'm speaking as a pastor practitioner.  I like the fact that you say there is some debate about whether that's two things or one, and there are people, I've seen some people who, I'm convinced by what you said that it's one thing, but there are people who say it's two.  What I do at Redeemer, what I've done over the years, and it's not a popular position, is to say, Paul is forbidding something here.  Something.  Something.  And I'm open to anybody who may have a different opinion from me on what that is or how that works itself out.  We also have to keep in mind that different denominations invest different levels of authority in different offices.  And therefore, what authority looks like in a Baptist church or a Presbyterian church or an Anglican church might be different.  So I'm open to that.  I am not open to somebody saying, there isn't anything he's forbidding or that was not a transcultural statement and therefore it doesn't bind us anymore. ",

Especially when you're talking about a New Testament passage.  It seems to me that the burden of proof is on the person who says it's not.  And it should be a very high bar.
