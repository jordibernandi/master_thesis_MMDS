            "text": "Hey Shalom everyone.  This is Amir Tsarfati.  I'm still in DC as you can see behind.  This is the Washington Monument over there.  I'm leaving tomorrow, but I mean, there's something really, really, really urgent that I wanted to update you on.  Ever since yesterday, The big techs, they started a major purge.  They started suppressing social media platforms of all conservative voices.  And my Twitter account lost over 2,000 followers overnight.  Not only mine, by the way, many, many, many.  However, why is it so important what I'm about to tell you?  You and I know that there are some conservative options now.  There is Parler, there is Rumble.  But what you fail to understand is that you cannot use Parler or Rumble unless you have an Apple or a Google device.  And guess what?  Apple just announced that they might not allow Parler or Rumble.  on their platforms unless they will comply with some, I guess, censorship in certain cases.  In other words, if you are running away from the censors to the free speech, Now it's not going to help you anymore because they are forcing Rumble and Parler to adopt some very draconian censorship things.  The point is this, within few weeks, within few weeks, almost all conservatives are going to be disappearing from social media overnight.  This is what is going to happen right now.  I want to urge you until it comes, because I won't be able to communicate with you anymore if it happens.  Please subscribe to our newsletter.  Go to our website, BeholdIsrael.org.  You can subscribe to our newsletter there because that's going to be the only way for me to communicate with you.  We're already working on acquiring a server that we can put all of our stuff there.  So we will be able just to send you links.  to watch whatever we do, whether it's live or recorded something.  But I want you to understand, make no mistake, Social media is going to completely ban all conservative voices and the big techs.  I'm not only talking about social media.  The big techs such as Apple and Google will make sure that all the conservative apps will not be able to have space in their app stores.  This is huge.  It's huge because overnight all The conservatives will be gone from your phone, from your laptop, from your iPad.  This is happening now in America.  I'm a building away.  You see that building right there, this one?  Oh, excuse me, no, over there.  Literally, I'm a building away from the White House.  I've seen a lot of commotion today.  I don't want to think what's going on there right now.  But I do tell you one thing.  A new era had begun.  on January 6th.  This is a day I will not forget.  Not only that I was here, but I can tell you America is changing.  And it's going to be very fast.  Everybody knows what happened on Capitol Hill.  Everyone knows who really led the violence there.  But they don't let facts confuse them.  They don't.  And right now they're using the momentum.  to have a very gruesome assault on conservatives right now.  Go to our website, BeholdIsrael.org, sign up as quickly as you can because I'm not even sure how long that's gonna be standing there.  But once you're subscribed, you're gonna get it as an email.  And we will be able to communicate with you and let you know where else you can find us the minute we are gone from social media.  Again, let me explain the big thing that is going on right now.  Not only that there is a big purge that started 24 hours ago on all conservative accounts on Twitter, YouTube, but mostly Facebook, all of them.  Now they're going to ban the conservative apps from their platforms, such as Parler and others.  You are going to see that Apple is already threatening Parler.  So what I'm trying to say is that overnight, The people you used to watch and be informed by, they're going to be gone.  They're going to disappear overnight.  So I want to urge you guys, at least when it comes to Behold Israel, I'm sure everybody will do something about it.  At least when it comes to Behold Israel, please go to our website, sign up for our newsletter.  Every week we send what we call Roundup.  And we will be in touch with you through there because we're going to be gone overnight.  It's a matter of weeks before all conservative voices will be completely gone from social media.  and from platforms such as Apple and Google.  They have declared war.  So please do me a favor.  I know this video is about to be not only censored but removed.  Right now, it's a Facebook Live.  They can't do anything.  So share it.  Share it as much as you can because within days or weeks, I'm telling you, we're gone.  They started the purge.  They're pressing hard.  They're using the momentum of what happened on Capitol Hill.  And they are now declaring all of us as we are the anarchists, okay?  Isaiah 5 says, Woe to those who call evil good and good evil, darkness light and light darkness.  Well, woe to them.  But this is exactly what we're witnessing right now.  So please do me a favor, share this video right now before it's going to be removed.  And as far as we're concerned, we would love to stay in touch with you.  But you will only be able to do that if you sign up to our weekly newsletter.  So you will be able to know what's going on with us.  We are only weeks away from being gone, maybe even days.  I'm not sure.  But the purge had begun yesterday.  And every conservative person I know reported that on Twitter and on Facebook.  It is in full force.  And I just got a word.  That Apple is threatening Parler that they will remove them if they do not comply with draconian rules of censorship.  So the free speech, they don't want free speech on Twitter and Facebook.  But now they are making sure that even the conservative apps will not have free speech as well.  This is, I mean, welcome to China.  Literally, welcome to China.  I'm very amazed.  I'm in DC.  This is the capital of the United States of America.  And that's what I'm talking about.  I mean, who would imagine?  I'm leaving tomorrow to LA, excuse me, to Southern California to speak.  Thank you for your prayers and for the time that we were here.  But again, share this video.  And again, do me a favor, subscribe to our weekly newsletter through our website, BeholdIsrael.org.  You'll find a way to do it.  And I want you to know that very soon, most of the, if not all the conservative voices on social media will be gone.  That's it.  They started a purge.  Just so you know, it's on full force.  And you really need to know that.  Thank you.  God bless you.  And Shalom from Washington, D.C ",
