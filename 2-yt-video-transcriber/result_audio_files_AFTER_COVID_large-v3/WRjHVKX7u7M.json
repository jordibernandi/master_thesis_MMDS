            "text": "For months, Turkey has been trying to blackmail Europe with demographic warfare.  They keep telling the EU that if they don't get their way on numerous issues, they will allow more people to illegally enter Europe.  The EU has paid Turkey an extremely large amount of money to stop the flow of illegal migrants.  In fact, just days ago, Angela Merkel sent another 32 million euro to the Turkish Coast Guard.  I've said in the past that it looked like Turkey was conducting a slow motion stand down.  Well, right now, Turkey is officially conducting a full stand down.  People are being given a green light to attempt illegal entry into Europe.  Of course, most of these people will be going to Greece where there are ongoing riots over illegal immigration.  people in lesbos and other islands have been a rioting over the construction of new asylum centers.  i talked about how new democracy gained a majority of the greek parliament last year.  a lot of people claim this was a huge conservative victory.  however I said they are a very weak center-right party and that I did not have faith in them.  New democracy needs to take immediate action.  It needs to be decisive and it needs to happen now.  Turkey has huge ambitions and is currently involved in a bunch of conflicts.  They are occupying part of Cyprus and engaged in a standoff with the EU over mining rights and the transfer of new weapons into Cyprus.  They have a huge military presence in Azerbaijan, where they are fighting against a breakaway Armenian region.  They are involved in the ongoing Libyan civil war.  They are occupying parts of northern Iraq and fighting Kurdish groups.  They are occupying parts of northern Syria and fighting the US sponsored YPG.  They also have a huge presence in the Idlib region of Syria.  This is controlled by an alliance of Salafist jihadists calling themselves the Salvation Government.  The largest remaining component of the Salvation Government is Hayat al-Tahrir al-Sham or HTS, formerly known as Nusra Front, which was the official Al-Qaeda franchise in Syria.  Previously, Turkey, Russia and Iran negotiated a peace deal.  The main task that Turkey agreed to perform was disarming HTS by the end of 2018.  Instead, they have done the exact opposite.  They are openly conducting military operations with the group and arming them.  In fact, Turkey recruited many of HTS's rivals to go fight in Rojava in Libya, thus making HTS even more powerful in Idlib.  Well, the Syrian army has been rapidly defeating HTS and retaking large swaths of Idlib.  If you go to the community section of this YouTube channel, I have a lot of information about this.  The Turkish army has been providing the Salafist militants with armored vehicles and Grad rockets.  More recently, the Turkish army has been providing them with heavy artillery support.  They have given the militants shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles known as MANPADS.  And now they are even supporting the militants with airstrikes conducted by sophisticated armed drones.  There was another Turkish escalation today.  Turkey fired long range missiles into two major Syrian cities, including Latakia, which has long been a beacon of peace and stability in Syria.  Militants were able to retake the city of Serekib today with Turkish artillery and air support.  However, that battle is still ongoing.  Now, two days ago, Turkey announced that 16 Turkish soldiers had been killed in Syria.  Today, they officially announced that five more were killed in Idlib and another four were killed by a car bomb in Rojava.  Well, people began saying on Twitter that the death toll of Turkish soldiers in Idlib was far higher.  Immediately after that, there was a nationwide outage of Twitter in the country of Turkey.  A crowd also gathered at a Turkish hospital near the Turkish-Idlib border crossing due to rumors of Turkish military casualties.  Well, there are alleged sources inside the Turkish government saying 29 Turkish soldiers were killed in Idlib today.  So to make a long story short, Turkey is throwing open the illegal immigration floodgates as retaliation for what they call a lack of European support for their adventures in Syria.  I know this is complicated.  In short, Turkey is demanding US and European support for their campaign to keep Salafist militants in power in Idlib.  They do not want the region to go back under the control of Bashar al-Assad.  Now, keep in mind, even anti-Assad groups admit that HTS and the so-called Salvation Government are extremely unpopular among the civilian population of Idlib.
