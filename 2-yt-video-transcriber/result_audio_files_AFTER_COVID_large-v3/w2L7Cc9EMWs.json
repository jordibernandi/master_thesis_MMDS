            "text": "Boris Johnson confirms the end of the BBC TV licence, a new boss has been appointed to drain the swamp of the BBC, and we give you the latest on illegal migration.  Hello everyone and welcome to today's show.  Yesterday we talked to you about the new boss of civil service who's going to be draining the swamp of the establishment with Dominic Cummings.  Today we're going to talk to you about the BBC because the Prime Minister has now confirmed that the BBC TV licence is going.  And also, the new boss has been appointed to drain the swamp of the BBC and the left-wing biased media that we have in this country.  But we also have some bad news about illegal migration.  But let's start with the BBC.  When I buy a copy of the Mirror, the Mail or the Telegraph, I'm not required to buy a copy of the Guardian.  And yet when I want to watch live TV on Sky, Amazon Prime or ITV, I am forced to pay for the BBC.  Does the Prime Minister believe that this is a sustainable situation in the medium or longer term?  Well, my honourable friend makes a very interesting point, a point of view that I'm sure was shared by many people in this country.  But my right honourable friend, the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, will be setting out a roadmap shortly for reform of the BBC and addressing the very issue that he mentions.  well that's all good good news it's welcoming and the whole point is according to my sources in whitehall they're saying that the first step is going to be to decriminalize the tv license and that's going to be happening very soon as soon as november.  and so that's that's the easy part.  and the next part is to actually change the funding structure the way the bbc is obviously getting the money from the taxpayers.  that's going to take some time but of the roadmap and the schedule timetable is going to be announced very soon.  but because of the bbc charter and how it has to be renewed every few years it will take some time.  but as long as we have the guarantee that the tv license will be reformed i'm fine.  let's talk about uh rural britannia.  As you remember, a couple of weeks ago, BBC said that they want to remove and ban and cancel Royal Britannia and also the Land of Hope and Glory, all the obviously songs that we have for patriotic songs for this country.  Then they said, OK, we'll keep them, but we'll remove the lyrics because they're, you know, controversial and some people are snowflakey.  And then because of the pressure that they've been under, and how they are now being warned that they're going to lose all their money, the gravy train, the BBC has now made a full U-turn to actually include the lyrics and in a very patronizing way.  So the BBC has performed an embarrassing U-turn on its original decision to forbid the singing of Royal Britannia at last night at the proms.  Now, whilst there will be no audience, the corporation has succumbed to public pressure and announced a select group of BBC singers will perform the patriotic piece.  They even added that viewers will be free to sing along at home.  Well, I'm very glad that the BBC has given us permission to sing along at home.  I really wanted to, you know, wait to see if the BBC will allow me to sing along because, you know, I didn't want to break the rules.  But luckily, they have now said that if you're sitting at home watching it, you are allowed to sing along.  Are you kidding me?  They've said that we've been looking hard at what else might be possible, and we have a solution.  Both pieces will now include a select group of singers.  BBC singers, actually.  This means the words will be sung in the hall, and as we have always made clear, audience will be free to sing at home.  So that's one thing.  And then they've also said that we hope everybody will welcome this solution.  We think that the night itself will be a very special moment for the country.  Yeah, yeah, we get it.  Now you care about us.  And this is all coming at a time when the BBC has just got a new boss.  And this boss is actually going to be creating a bit of a shake-up.  And we're going to obviously discuss who he is, Tim Davey.  This is actually good news, but we have to be obviously cautious about this.  We've been receiving a lot of good news recently.  You know, yesterday we had the last couple of days, we had the new chief of... civil service.  We have Boris Johnson finally waking up and becoming more of a Boris Johnson.  Dominic Cummings is back at work wearing a suit.  But let's talk about Team Davey.  Yeah, so Team Davey is now going to be creating a bit of a shake-up.  He's now going to be in charge of reforming the BBC TV licence, the funding structure, and also he wants to tackle the BBC bias and get rid of certain people and certain shows.  Now, one senior Whitehall source has said that the decriminalisation of the licence fee is a done deal.  It will be sooner rather than later, but it may be the least of the BBC's worries.  One minister has said that there is real optimism that the BBC will come up with a palatable alternative to the license fee themselves.  Now, Tim Davies seems to be open to the idea of a subscription model, and his background would certainly suggest that.  Now, we know because of all the pressure the BBC are trying to behave now, but not fully, not everyone in that organization are listening.  Yeah, does he have an example?  This is, you know, today and yesterday, all the news about the U-turns.  So when it comes to the government, they say U-turn over lockdown easing.  And when it comes to the BBC themselves, they say BBC reverses prom's decision on rule Britannia.  One is a U-turn, one is a reversal.  Yeah, definitely not biased guys.  Very professional.  Now, Tim Davie has also said that left-wing comedy shows will be under threat because he plans a major shake-up because of the way the broadcasters are actually managing these shows.  He thinks that comedy broadcast by the BBC is perceived as targeting the Conservative Party more often than it does the left.  and this is according to the inside sources that told the telegraph.  now the corporation's new director general is due to outline the issue in his first speech on thursday which is today and now he has officially taken over from the previous BBC boss Tony Hall.  And the whole point of it is that he hopes that this will restore trust and confidence in the public broadcaster.  Now, even Ben Bradley has obviously welcomed the news, a Tory MP who's very much against the BBC and has slammed the BBC recently because of it.  constant left-wing rants.  In addition, comedy panel shows will be expected to include guests with a broader range of views.  There will also be a crackdown on BBC journalists expressing their political views on social media.  They're not going to be too happy.  They can't tweet anymore.  So I don't mind.  The BBC could do whatever they want.  As long as Tim Davey and Dominic Cummings are obviously planning to change the funding structure, as long as I don't fund it and nobody else by force, you could do whatever you want.  But at the same time, because of ofcom it's good news that tim davey and the the new team actually want to also tackle the bias because the issue with the bbc is not just the funding it's the bias and he's actually want to do this again.  let's give him a chance.  we don't know just yet.  so we'll wait for a few months or a year or so to see um if he has achieved what he wants to do.  now even bill gardner is talking about how team davey believes that the bbc comedy shows are seen to be one-sided and unfairly biased against the tories donald trump and brexit.  now all this goes back to the first week of september which is now.  this is the first week when uh everyone's officially back back at work.  the government is back parliament is back dominic cummings is back wearing suit um and a lot of things are changing.  And the next big change is going to be at the Home Office.  And Priti Patel, we're going to get to that because there's some bad news there.  But the whole point of it is that first we elected Boris Johnson.  As you know, we've criticised Boris on bad policies.  We've also praised him on good policies.  You know, it's not a black and white issue.  It's best not to be tribal.  It's best to be objective.  But, you know, at the end of the day, he's still the People's Prime Minister.  He's trying his best.  And we have Dominic Cummings.  So Boris Johnson obviously wasn't welcomed by your established politicians.  Then Dominic Cummings came along to do a bit of a shake-up and he wasn't welcomed by your traditional established special advisers and political people.  Next this week we have the new head of civil service, Simon Case, who is not welcome.  by your typical established civil servants, because they're all, you know, anti-Simon Case, anti-common sense and anti-sound policies.  And now we have Tim Davey, the new BBC boss, who's not welcomed by your typical established left-wing BBC staff.  So all these things are changing in one week, and so obviously it's great news, but The Home Office are messing up as usual.  Yes, yesterday we had 409 people reaching the UK.  This is a record, the largest number we had for one day who came to Dover and the Border Force obviously had to intervene and stop them.  Now, according to obviously the Home Office, they have said that hundreds of others, other boats and people were actually stopped in the water Whilst others, which is this 409 migrants, actually managed to land on beaches.  So they have at least tried to stop hundreds of others as well.  So it could have been a lot more, but somehow they messed up and 409 migrants managed to arrive here.  Dover, and this brings the total number who have successfully made the journey this year to more than 5,600.  Now, this is a bit of a messed up situation.  As you know, Nigel Farage has been covering this, a number of others have been covering this.  Priti Patel has lost her patience.  She's been going around the home office shouting at people and trying to change some of the stuff that they're doing.  Now, there's one issue with the border force, and to stop the migrants and the boats and turn them around.  The second issue is pretty new policies to, well, the new move is to return them as soon as possible.  Then you have the left-wing lawyers in this country, the woke ones, stopping deportations.  I don't understand why this is happening.  So this is the biggest problem we have.  We can't stop the boats because we're stopping at some of them, but you can't stop all of them because the wave is huge.  And if they arrive, we now struggle to send them back because of our left wing lawyers and courts.  Now obviously Boris Johnson has now said that the UK is a target and magnet for people traffickers and has now promised to change the actual law to help tackle the crisis and Priti Patel herself has already acted so this.  this happened yesterday and today she's just started to return the actual migrants so 11 channel migrants are now flying back to Spain.  Despite the 11th hour dubious challenge, the Home Office sources said that despite best efforts of the activist lawyers and the typical European countries and especially the French authorities, they managed to actually kick out some of the people who entered this country illegally.  because they have no right to be here.  Well, that's good news because they decided this time to act quicker so they don't give time to the left-wing lawyers to create a case.  So 409 people came.  As of the moment I'm making this video, 11 has now been returned quickly.  This is a big problem.  11 out of 409 is not enough, obviously.  But Boris and Priti are putting more pressure on the Home Office and the Border Force to see what they can do because this Changing the law thing is taking some time guys.  And at the same time, we as taxpayers have to fund the actual cases and for the migrants and also their accommodations and everything else and the process that they have to go through.  So again, the people who want to enter this country legally, they're being undermined.  the actual local people in this country and their livelihood is also being undermined because you know you can just go wherever you want.  apparently there's no law and order so we'll have to wait and see.  so we had some good news and there are some changes.  that's happening this week with the civil service, the BBC, the government, the next big thing to focus on is the Home Office and illegal migration.  Thanks again for watching everybody.  As usual, most of you know, we have a new daily schedule which we're just announcing now.  I'm going to put the actual schedule at the end of the video so you can actually get used to it.  hopefully towards the end of this week or early next week we're going to actually start officially to actually work on it two videos a day.  we're going to have the news show and everything else for the members.  some of the videos are for the members.  the others are obviously open.  if you want to support the channel become a member then obviously check out the link in the description or just go on youtube.com.  slash myotc slash join but also brand new information.  we have our official merch finally ready.
