My name's David Stewart.  I don't care what your name is, get out the way.  Can you tell him to hang up and move so I can leave?  Thank you.  I asked you one question.  It's none of your business.  It is not.  So then move out the way then.  I'm not moving.  Tom, it's a bad day.  I got the president of the homeowners association over here at this last stop, got me blocked in so I can't leave.  And he called the cops.  Hey, all we want to know is why you're in here and who gave you the gay code.  That's all we need to know.  Show me your badge.  So then you don't have a reason to ask me any questions.  He said he was calling to talk to the police to let them know that I could come out, but I didn't want to move right away just in case it made it seem like I was trying to flee the scene or something like that.  There's too much going on mentally. ",
