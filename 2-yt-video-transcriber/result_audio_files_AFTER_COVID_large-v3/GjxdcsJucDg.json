            "text": "Hey, what's up guys?  Dr.  Boyce Watkins here.  I wanted to answer a couple of questions.  Some of you were asking me what I think about the whole situation between Will and Jada and this little kid she was dating named August Alsina, who's a singer.  And I've seen August a couple of times.  The brother ain't right mentally.  He's a little bit disturbed.  And I was kind of surprised by that.  But, you know, when it comes to love and sex, people do what they're going to do and it is what it is.  But a few things I want to mention about that.  First of all, I think that this is a great lesson.  Assuming this is all legit, assuming this is not all made up.  It really speaks to, you know, if you look at how this all started, it started because.  They did something private and August decided he wanted to tell everybody what happened.  He did.  He violated something that, you know, I think it is kind of a code, you know, he kissed and told.  Right.  And I think you should also, if you're a person that has something to lose, whether it's your family or your money or your fame or whatever it is, a success, you know, be thoughtful about who you entangle with because they can take that entanglement and then make that a story.  And next thing you know, you're out here trying to explain your way out of a weird situation that really should have been kept private in the first place.  And that's my next point.  I kind of was surprised that Will and Jada actually talked about it in public.  I didn't quite get it.  I was thinking, gosh, they have a lot of money.  Do they need the publicity that bad?  I don't think they do.  It didn't make sense to me.  I know if something had happened with me and Alicia, just know it ain't going to be happening.  No red table, no blue table, no purple table.  Ain't nobody... The only table that's going to happen there is our kitchen table.  That would be it.  But also the other thing too that's interesting is that I think a lot of people don't understand Hollywood.  relationships are usually more complex than you might think.  I've been around Hollywood actors and stars and celebrities and some of these people live lives that regular people don't understand.  And so a lot of times they'll try to maintain an image that fits inside some sort of normative box that regular people live in.  When you live in a world where you literally have enough money to do whatever you want and people give you the power to do whatever you want whenever you want, it can change who you are.  It can change your incentive.  So I think that there's a lot more to all of this than meets the eye.  A lot of people don't even really know how some of these relationships operate.  You know, where, for example, you're married, you stay married to somebody because you're trying to protect your brand.  Most people don't quite get that, right?  They maybe a little bit, but not completely.  And also remember, Will and Jada are actors.  So I'm not saying that they're acting.  I'm just saying, just remember that they're actors.  and But the last quick point I'll throw in here is this.  Look, you know, you heard Jada doing a lot of mansplaining her way out of what she did.  You know, I was healing.  I was broken.  I was in an entanglement, you know, and it's fine.  I mean, it's fine.  I saw people saying, oh, well, you see, she was healing.  She was broken.  She was in it.  okay fine well you know the thing is.  in that situation you have to acknowledge that there might be a double standard because i've seen a lot of guys who also were healing and broken and got into an entanglement and they were defined to be dogs they were just you.  oh you just trying to explain away the fact that you just wanted to feel good.  wait didn't jada say i just i hadn't felt good in a long time.  and that doesn't just mean that maybe she just wanted some ass?  i i don't know.  maybe maybe i'm just oversimplifying it but but you know whatever.  right now here's the thing right in that situation when you have a double standard you can either raise the standard or you can lower the standard.  you get one or the other.  you can't raise it and lower.  you can't raise it for some people and lower it for others right?  so either jada it was full of shit like a lot like like you think a lot of men might be because i've seen a lot of guys lose their entire families because they decided to go to sleep with somebody.  either that or maybe you could consider the fact that maybe when men also get into entanglements uh there are some complex emotional reasons.  maybe he's being denied affection maybe he's not happy maybe he made a mistake maybe he was.  he was broken and he was healing and he was trying to help someone else heal.  you know right i'm kidding but the point is like either raise the standard or lower the standard but either way if you're going to have a standard have a standard right.  it is what it is.  last point i'll throw in here though is this look a lot of people will bring up the important point and this is important that they were separated at the time.  yeah jada and will were not together at the time and the fact that they were separated was you know, critical to all of this, right?  When you're separated, you technically can do whatever you want.  It is what it is.  But here's the interesting part about it that you got to also consider, though.  Ask yourself this question.  If you had a spouse and your 19 year old child brought home one of their friends and your spouse says, oh, well, I'm I'm separated.  I can go start having sex with my daughter's best friend.  Would you consider that to be okay?  Or would you have said, you know, you could have got with a grown woman instead of a baby, right?  Uh, you know, the, the, you know, so, so again, August was over the age of 18, so it's legal, but at the same time, you know, you can't, you know, remember R Kelly also was dating women who were above age.  Those two girls that he had living in his apartment who said they were there on their own by their own decision.  Remember they were over the age of 18 too.  And the reaction that the public had to that was very different.  from the reaction of jada.  you know jada dating this other guy who is about the same age as the girls r kelly was dating.  so i'm not saying that one is right one is wrong.  i'm not telling you what your value system is supposed to be.  i'm just saying that maybe highlighting this is something worth thinking about.  so either way i would say practical advice just uncle boyce advice is you know whatever you do in the bedroom.  i mean i'm not judging that that's on you.  uh just you know.  consider you Consider who you're trusting yourself with, because in this situation, what I see, assuming that this is legit, basically Jaden August had a thing and August decided he had to promote a record.  So he's like, oh, I got a great Jada's Pinkett Smith story that can make me money.  And I'm going to go share the story.  And so that's why, you know, when you got something to lose, you probably want to get with other people that have something to lose, because if you have something to lose and they have nothing to lose.  then you might be the one losing everything.  So that's my two cents.  I'm Dr.  Boyce Watkins.  Have a good day.  Make sure you subscribe, hit the thumbs up button, and follow me on Instagram at TheRealBoyceWatkins.  I'll see you soon.  Take care.  Peace. ",
