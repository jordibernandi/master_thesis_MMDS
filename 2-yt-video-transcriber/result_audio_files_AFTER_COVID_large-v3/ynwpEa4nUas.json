            "text": "You have a shy way, come to take the throne.  To conquer world powers, bring Jacob home.  I'm quarterbacking like Jake the Lone.  Like Mount Rushmore, I got a face of stone.  You want to know what we're about?  Yes, sir.  If you don't mind me asking real quick, what's your name?  My father's name?  My father's name?  My father's name?  That's what we're trying to do.  We're trying to wake up our people today.  When they call us black or Hispanic, those are five words that third people actually put on our hands.  Black is a color in the crayon box.  It's not a nation of people.  There's not a land of black-eyed people.  We don't have a government.  We don't have an army.  None of them.  So we're waking up our people to their true identity.  So as so-called Black, Hispanics, and Native Americans, we are actually the Israelites of the Bible, so God's chosen people.  That's right.  So what do you think about the atrocities that your people have done to ours over the last 500 years?  Let's just say the last 500 years.  What's your answer?  I can't really speak to it since I wasn't there, but I am glad that we are all peacefully working together, right?  Okay, but you have studied history in some way.  I mean, some kind of history.  You do understand the atrocities that we are people of color.  These are atrocities that will go on for... And for a millennia, if we don't do something about it.  Right.  And it looks like y'all are doing something.  Absolutely.  That's what we're doing about it.  Now, what do you think you can do to actually help our conference?  I guess just be open to y'all's suggestions of what you think, right?  Okay, I'll tell you exactly what I mean.  Now, you believe in karma, you believe in justice, you believe in movement, so... Okay, let's see what the Bible has to say.  This is the book of 2 Thessalonians, chapter 1 and verse 6.  Saying it is a righteous thing with God.  So with God, it is a right thing to do this, right?  To recompense tribulation to them.  that trouble you.  Do you believe in the Bible?  She said you're Christian.  She was better than you.  No, you asked what my father was, and I took what's right.  No, but, no, okay, so your father was Christian.  Right.  So you don't... Um, word for word, no.  I believe it is a guide, not necessarily a manual.  My... Not necessarily.  It's a little more in-depth than that, but in a giant picture, I'm more spiritual than I am romantic.  So, do you believe in the  T.T.?  Would you like me to read it again?  Yeah, I heard it.  No, I didn't.  Yeah, I definitely didn't.  There's, um... So, you think it's a righteous thing for you all to be paid back the same way that you don't pay us?  You all, that's it.  Personally?  As in your forefathers.  No.  Oh, you don't believe that?  You don't believe that that should be paid for?  I thought you said that I should be paid for.  I was like, what?  No.  Not at all.  Whether there should be an equaling of things?  Sure.  Okay, let's see what the vote says.  This is the book of Isaiah, chapter 14 and verse 21.  Prepare slaughter for his children, for the iniquity of their fathers.  So their fathers have sinned.  The greatest sin known to them.  And then they ran out on the bill.  But you all are continuing to benefit from it, and you all are collecting trillions of dollars off of it.  Really quickly, I totally appreciate what y'all are doing and what you stand for, but you all are moving me into that?  That's not your forefathers?  Your forefathers didn't do this?  No, but then you said you all are, that's right.  I am not.  I'm a bunch of others not doing that every day.  The only way that you can not do.  that is to not be here.  It's to go back to the darkest mountains of Georgia, Russia.  Then you're no longer, you know, contributing to the stuff.  Right now, you're a part of the system.  No matter what you do, you're a part of it.  Outside of, like I said, you can go back to the darkest mountains of Georgia, Russia.  Now, the Bible is saying that, read that again.  It's the book of Isaiah, chapter 14, verse 21.  This is what God says.  Prepare slaughter.  He says to get ready to kill.  For his children.  Children, their children, read.  For the iniquity of their fathers.  So for this, it says to prepare slaughter.  Like, trust me, you may not know your people are at war, but your people understand that we are at war.  This is a war that's been going on for over 500 years.  And you all have been consistently slaughtering us.  And like I said, as long as you... As long as you're still here as part of the system, you are worth it to be interpreted.  The book of Revelations chapter 13 and verse 10.  He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity.  So the Most High God has promised us that if one nation leads another nation into captivity, into slavery, that that nation goes into slavery.  That's right.  Like when our forefathers went into slavery, they weren't all bad people.  That's right.  He that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword.  Every 28 hours or less, a so-called Black, Hispanic, or Native American is gunned down at this country.  Every 28 hours or less, with their hands up and trying to give up their weapons on them, they are murdered.  And it's by your law enforcement.  The Bible says that now your people as a whole are responsible for that, and you all must be killed by the sword.  Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.  What you got?  Yeah, we got it.  It's the book of Zechariah, chapter 11 and verse 5.  Bring it out.  Whose possessors slay them.  Our possessors slay us because we're still in the possession of your people.  We haven't been freed from this land yet.  I can't leave here and go back to my homeland.  Guess who's in my homeland today?  That's right.  The book of Zechariah chapter 11 and verse 5.  Whose possessors slay them and hold themselves not guilty.  Isn't that what the gospel tells us today?  They slay us and then hold themselves not guilty.  This is Bible prophecy.  The Bible is true to the beginning to end.  Because what it says is going to happen, it happens.  The book of Numbers, chapter 35 and verse 33.  Bring it out.  So you shall not pollute the land wherein you are.  For blood, it defiled the land.  Blood defiled the land.  Hundreds of millions of our people shed their blood on this land.  So this land of America is defiled, right?  Now, how do you clean this defiled land?  How do you think God says to clean the blood on this land?  And the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is set therein, but by the blood of him.  that said it.  So now, your forefathers are no longer here to shed their blood, right?  But where is it?  It's still found in your body, right?  So to clean the land, what do we need?  I wanted to come see where you're about.  Thank you for sharing your needs.  I appreciate the strength behind your beliefs.  I do.  Even though we might not have the same, I think that is okay.  I appreciate you guys sharing your needs.  I'm gonna go.  Bye.  I appreciate any support as well.  I just believe in what the Bible says.  All right, so let your people know about the truth about what you all need to do.  Send your blood or go back to the market.  Gotcha.  Thank you.  Sakari.  Sakari.  We are the children of the one Yahuwah.  The chosen.  Ye are the chosen of the one Yahuwah.  And he has given his laws to us.  Now everything belongs to us. ",
