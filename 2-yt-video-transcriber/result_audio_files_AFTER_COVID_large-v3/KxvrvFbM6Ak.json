            "text": "Hey everybody, this is Jerry Williams, aka Greater Sapien.  Thanks for stopping by.  I come to you again with some more globe denier foolishness.  Now, a few days ago I spoke to you about a flat earther that said it wasn't possible for the moon to be reflecting sunlight because a sphere does not reflect light.  Now, obviously that claim is a bunch of nonsense, but I went ahead and made a demonstration to show it.  Now here's the thing about globe deniers.  Trying to convince them of anything is a complete waste of time, as they are incapable of learning.  Well, it's not that they are incapable of learning, it's that they are aggressively devoted to ignorance.  But at the same time, globe deniers are great springboards for explaining things for people who actually want to know something.  Here's what I mean about it being a waste of time to try to convince them.  For my last video, I referenced a YouTuber that claimed that light cannot reflect off a sphere.  Those were his precise words.  When I showed that to be asinine, he then claimed that it was that a beam of light can't reflect back toward itself off a round surface and that I was twisting his words.  Slandering him.  He then admits that light can reflect off round surfaces, just not that particular direction.  And I was a fraud for proving the original statement wrong.  Now, what I really need to prove is that light can bounce back 180 degrees off a sphere and that it can bounce back to the dark side of another object.  More specifically, that a beam can go past an object like the Earth, reflect off a round object like the Moon, and come back 180 degrees to the backside of the Earth object.  because that's what the heliocentric model says happens during a full Moon.  And while I'm at it, Why don't I explain why they make diagrams of eclipses that look like this?  Because everyone knows the sun's rays don't shoot toward the earth like that.  And oh, maybe show how the moon's shadow can be smaller than the moon during eclipse because that can't happen in reality.  Shadows are never smaller.  It's always something else with these guys.  Now, I can prove him to be wrong about every single one of his positions, but it will not matter.  He will find something else to discuss.  Get a light source 400 times bigger than your moon object.  Place it proportionally as far away as the sun would be and make your moon object reflect only 12% of the light.  If you can't replicate that, then your heliocentric model is wrong.  Ha ha, I win.  Watch for it.  Now, let's look at the challenges that these globe deniers come up with and show how easy it is to disprove these claims and explain the basic lack of understanding.  Can light bounce 180 degrees off of a sphere?  Of course it can.  Remember, this user has admitted that we see objects because light reflects off of them.  It's the 180 degrees.  that's the issue now.  Take this video footage.  The light source is the flash of the camera, a half a centimeter away from the camera lens, and we're seeing the reflection of that light source.  That's pretty close to 180 degrees.  But since the camera is not the actual light source, it's not quite 180, is it?  It's reflecting light maybe 179.5 degrees.  How do we show 180 degrees if the camera lens isn't also the light source?  How about this?  How about I take this laser pointer, cover most of the source with tape, and bounce a beam off of the sphere and watch it bounce back to the source?  We all see that reflection, right?  We all know that the laser beam has been reflected back to the source, right?  180 degrees?  Okay, that's been taken care of.  Next, what about bouncing back to the dark side of another object like the Earth?  Now, this user proposed having light shine past a basketball or something to a moon and reflect the light to the dark side of the ball.  We'll do it this way.  Now, there's our light source shining past our Earth to a moon ball over there.  Is that ball reflecting light onto the dark side of our Earth?  Well, if I can move this camera up against the dark side and still see that moon, That means it is because we all agreed that if we see an object, that means that the light has been reflected toward us.  Remember that?  Good.  Well, there you go.  This is the view from the dark side of the earth.  Next.  What?  Wait a minute, Jerry.  That camera position isn't really 180 degrees from the light source, is it?  Didn't the flat earther, say, reflect off a round object like the moon and come back 180 degrees to the backside of the earth object?  because that's what the heliocentric model says happens for a full moon?  Yeah, he did.  And this isn't 180 degrees.  Why?  Because the solar system model does not say the sun's rays go past the earth, hit the moon, and come back 180 degrees.  At least, it doesn't once you get beyond a grade school education.  You see, our poorly informed flat earther is thinking about this two-dimensional diagram of the phases of the moon.  The moon is over here, directly in line with the earth and the sun, making a 180 degree reflection path for the sun's light.  I've replicated it here with real objects.  But this model is simplified for printing and ease of viewing.  This has all the objects on the same plane for a full moon.  But that's not what the solar system model says.  In reality, the objects are not all on the same plane.  So even if it seems like they are 180 degrees from one point of view, from another position, you can see that they are not.  This is how a full moon works in the solar system model.  Very rarely are all the objects truly in line on the same plane, and when they are, it's no longer just a full moon, it's an eclipse, as the earth blocks the sun's light from reaching the moon and reflecting to the earth, or the moon blocks the sun's light in case of a solar eclipse.  So, to sum these pieces up, it's perfectly possible to reflect light 180 degrees off a sphere.  but it's not required during a full moon because the sun, earth, and moon are not on the same plane most of the time.  And when they are on the same plane, that's an eclipse.  Speaking of eclipses, this guy also wants to know why eclipse diagrams look this way with all the sun's rays going toward the earth like this, when that isn't reality. ",
