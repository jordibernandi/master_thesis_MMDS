            "text": "We heard a lot of bull from this old pozo as he blathers on like your uncle drunk on a highball.  H-I-H-I highball.  But this takes a cake when he got on the mic, shoved the doctors aside and then put out a call to try Lysol.  H-Y-S-O-L-I-S-O.  L-I-S-O-L.  Now he is the world's most ridiculed guy because he thinks that light can be shined inside right up your asshole.  Gay as an asshole.  Well he's so dumb that he don't understand why you can't have a vaccine that comes in a can of Lysol.  La la la la Lysol.  La la la la Lysol.  Well, he tried so hard to walk it back, but nothing can wash away the facts.  He said he meant it sarcastically.  I said, little man, you ain't fooling me.  He is the world's least compassionate guy.  He doesn't care if you die.  He won't claim he was right about lies.  So, la, la, la, la, lies.  So, la, la, la, la, lies.  So, I'll push you away.  Hope you have a go.  We all know the cure Because you're the disease.  We got to return to sanity A kitchen towel and a countertop spray And I always wanted to be that way for my lies, so La la la la lies, so Truth turns to lies and lies turn to truth.  And some dumb fool, one who'll listen to you will drink lies, so La la la la lies, so While we stayed home under quarantine I sprayed disinfectant on my TV screen Tryin' to wipe away this toxic man.  Better go out and buy another can.  Well, he is the world's most despicable man But we know he's a sham, he'll poison us if he can And so will I, so La-la-la-la-lie, so La-la-la-la-lie, so Light so.  Light so.  Light so.  Light so.  Light so.  Light so.  Light so.  Light so. ",
