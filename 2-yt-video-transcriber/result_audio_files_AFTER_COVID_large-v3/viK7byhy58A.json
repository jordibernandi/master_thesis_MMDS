            "text": "Everybody keep your eyes on Syria.  Things are escalating and this could end us marching us into another conflict, whether we like it or not, unfortunately, due to NATO.  This is really, you know, I keep thinking the military industrial complex, the people that are behind it, they're going to figure out a way to march us into a war.  And this is the way to do it.  If Trump won't go in and go after Iran and declare it, now he can't without Congress.  But if Trump won't escalate us into wars, and if he's going to keep pulling us out of areas like Afghanistan, then the one sure way to get us in is our NATO agreement.  We have an agreement.  We have to back up a NATO nation if their borders are attacked.  and this is going to be the way that they're finally gonna get us into another escalation.  The latest is, now I talked about this a bit yesterday, so I'm just gonna, in case you missed it, I'm gonna give you an overview of what's going on.  So Turkey has taken over the border all in Syria.  So they've got control, or they've done a deal with Syria in order to protect their border.  On the eastern side, it's from the Kurdish forces.  So when Turkey moved in against the Kurds, the deal that the Kurds made and the deal that Turkey and Iran and Russia made was that the Syrian forces, along with Russian forces, would actually guard that line along the border with Turkey from the Kurds, that they would push the Kurds back.  So that is what's going on on that side.  But there's another side in Syria that is being contested, or there's fighting going over it, and it's the Idlib region, which is on the western border of Syria and Turkey.  What's going on there is this is where a lot of the rebel fighters that were fighting all around the country, a lot of them fled when they would lose these other regions to Syrian government forces.  They would flee up to Idlib, and that's where they all kind of conglomerated up there.  And the mixture of people, this is a variety of different rebels, a variety of different factions, all of them against the Syrian government, including some that are in terrorist organizations like al-Qaeda.  And Turkey has been protecting them and helping them and backing some of the rebel forces up there.  So there was a deal made in 2018, the Sochi agreements, that Turkey would be allowed to have a safe zone in that region in exchange for getting rid of all the terrorists like al-Qaeda and allowing Syria to have access to the M5 highway which links Damascus all the way up to Aleppo.  So Syria wants to open up their country again, open up for trade, open up for movement.  Well, for a variety of reasons, each side has their own side of the story, of course.  But Turkey is saying that their forces and their troops, the Turkish troops, are under fire by Syrian government forces, and that they will not tolerate this, and that if the Syrian government forces continue to kill Turkish troops, that it will mean war between Turkey and Syria.  Syria is claiming, however, their side of the story is, no, you guys have been attacking us.  You, or maybe it's extremists like Al-Qaeda fighters, or maybe it is your rebels, but we're under attack and we're just responding to that attack.  However, Assad has come out saying, we're going to take over all of Syria.  We almost have complete liberation of our country.  And so it sounds like he's definitely wanting to take back control over that Idlib region, which was supposed to be a safe zone.  in that area that Turkey could use to repatriate some of their 3.5 million refugees.  So, Turkey has absorbed 3.5 million Syrians into their country.  It's a huge problem for Turkey.  They want to repatriate many of them back into Syria.  And they also want to prevent all of those rebels and the family members of the rebels who went up to Idlib region, who were fleeing the rest of Syria when they would lose.  He's trying to prevent that roughly one million more people coming into Turkey fleeing Assad.  So that's Turkey's viewpoint, is that they want to create this safe zone region of Syria where they can repatriate these millions of people.  And Syria's point of view is that they're trying to get rid of extremism in their country.  Assad runs a secular government where anybody can be any religion they want except for an extremist.  You cannot be into Wahhabi, Salafist, Diabani-type stuff.  So there's this fighting.  So the thing is that we need to be paying attention to.  The biggest issue that we need to pay attention to is the escalation with Turkey's military.  So Turkey marches itself in.  If Turkey comes under attack by Syria itself, then under the NATO agreement, we have to go to war on behalf of Turkey.  All of the NATO countries have to go to war on behalf of Turkey because Turkey's borders are being threatened by another government.  So that is alarming.  Now, Erdogan came out saying, if you kill any of our soldiers, it means war.  And he's been saying this for the last couple of weeks.  He sat down with Russia trying to negotiate a better deal for Idlib region.  Those deal talks have fallen apart.  And the latest report coming out today, which is very scary, is that two Turkish soldiers were killed and five more were wounded by pro-Syrian government forces.  That is what Erdogan needs in order to declare war.  Now, I don't think Turkey really wants to go to war with Syria.  This would mean kind of a proxy war with Russia and Iran.  I don't think Turkey really wants that.  But who does want that?  the military industrial complex wants that, don't they?  They've been trying to get us into war with Iran for a while.  And the fact that Trump has now announced a potential deal with Afghanistan, with the Taliban, that means we're going to be removing troops from Afghanistan.  And the big military machine, the war machine doesn't like that when we send troops home.  No, no, no.  They need a reason to keep their multibillion dollar contracts going.  That means they need more war.  So they don't like that.  Trump has removed many of the troops from Syria, that he's wanting to remove many of the troops from Afghanistan.  Now, Trump has not really lived up to his promises of ending these crazy wars, but he's certainly been, he hasn't made it worse and he's been better in a lot of ways.  I mean, he certainly definitely crossed the line there when he killed General Soleimani from Iran.  That was certainly an escalation that could have led to something terrible.  Luckily, Iran was had more sense than the United States did in that moment.  But, you know, this is this is the thing that the military war machine was once, right?  This is what they need.  They need Turkey to do the dirty work.  If Trump's not going to declare war with Iran, if Trump's going to continue to remove these troops from various regions and try to shut down all of these conflicts, then the one thing they can do is try to march Turkey into war.  And if Turkey gets marched into war, then the United States, by default, because of the NATO agreement, has to go to war on behalf of Turkey.  So you can kind of work around Donald Trump and instead use NATO as your justification, as your gateway in to the war that you're really, truly wanting.  Now, this would be a war potentially with Russia and certainly a war with Iran.  I don't know if the U.S.\u2014I don't even know if really the big war machine wants a direct conflict with Russia.  But they certainly want a direct conflict with Iran.  We can guarantee that.  So by proxy, if NATO has to come to Turkey's rescue or defense in this Turkish-Syrian war that could potentially start, then that could be the needed excuse to go into a full-fledged conflict with Iran, because Iranian forces are in Syria protecting Syria as well.  So this is definitely a situation to watch, and it's highly suspect.  We know that in the attempts to\u2014well, we largely suspect, I should say, in the attempts to march us into war with Iran, that there were potentially some real false flags going on in Iran, like oil tankers being hit.  And there was all this stuff, and Iran was saying, that wasn't us.  We didn't do it.  And so it could have potentially been whoever wants, whoever benefits from us going to war, maybe they did it, and then they're blaming it on Iran, and that would get us into the conflict.  So this is another one of those where a lot of false flags could potentially happen.  Turkey has drawn their line in the sand.  They said, here's our red line.  You kill any of our soldiers, we're going to war.  Well, that gives a lot of people some incentive to start killing some Turkish soldiers.  That gives, you've got a few people, so kind of like a game of Clue, whodunit, The Kurds, they have a reason to want to do this, because the Kurds are trying to fight the Turks coming in to Syria, right?  The Kurds want that whole region.  They want to create a Kurdistan.  And they've been prevented from doing that because of Turkey.  And the Syrian government is playing a buffer over there.  The Syrian government forces, along with the Russians, are protecting that line and backing the Kurds off and backing the Turks off.  They're kind of right there in the middle playing peacemaker.  the Syrian government has to turn on Turkey and declare war on Turkey, then that's good for the Kurds.  They can move up to that border, say, hey, we'll fight alongside you.  We don't like them either.  And then they can all go and engage in battle.  And then that could maybe restore the Kurdish hopes of a Kurdistan.  So it could be the Kurds, you know, whodunit, with Clue.  It could be the United States.  You've got some bad actors in the U.S.  who really would love to see the U.S.  march into war with Iran and keep troops in the Middle East.  So the U.S.  might have some\u2014definitely has a motive to want to maybe take out some Turkish soldiers in order to create a conflict between Turkey and Syria, which would then help the United States military-industrial complex.  And, of course, you do have rebels in Syria who do not want Assad in charge of the country.  They're still in their last-ditch efforts, hoping that they can take control over Syria.  And so you've got\u2014you've certainly got rebels and al-Qaeda and a variety of different people who don't want Assad in power.  They, of course, too, have a reason to want to attack some\u2014.  Wait, let me think, does that make sense?  So they're fighting on behalf of, well, they would be fighting the Syrian government simply because they're still fighting the Syrian government.  So they wouldn't want to be taking out Turkish soldiers, but they certainly would be firing on the Syrian forces in order to get them to fire on the Turkish soldiers.  So they could potentially be, well, they would just be provocateurs on that front.  So I don't know, they wouldn't be killing actual Turks.  Or would they?  Would they?  Let's think about that.  If you were a Syrian rebel and you were sided with the Turks, the Turks were protecting you, but they're not really allowing you to engage.  So that's the thing.  Yeah, so I guess they would.  They would potentially take out a couple of Turks, because the Turks in that region, the deal, the Sochi agreement is that the Turks would also keep the rebels back.  They're supposed to be keeping the rebels back, and they're supposed to be eliminating terrorists like al-Qaeda.  and not allowing any more escalation or engagement against Syria.  So, yeah, you know what?  If you were a rebel, you would fire on a Turk because you'd say, let's do this.  Quit holding me back.  Let's do this.  Let's go to war.  and you would stage it and say, oh, no, it was Syrian government forces when really it was you.  So, yeah, they would have a reason to do it as well.  There's a lot of potential players in this who would have a motivation to escalate into a larger conflict over there.  But we certainly need to keep our eyes open to it because it very well could be, and there's a huge, huge monetary reason for many people here in this country and around the world to want to continue conflict.  wants the United States to remain in conflict in the Middle East.  So we definitely need to keep our eyes open.  We don't know how Erdogan and Turkey are going to respond to this latest attack of the two Turkish soldiers who were killed and the five more that were wounded in the last 24 hours.  Not sure how he's going to respond to that, but we will find out.  We need to keep our eyes open on the conflict that is going on in Syria.  Definitely something to watch.

Whenever I talk about war and terror, I often get demonetized.  It's a big, you know, they can talk about it all they want on Fox News and CNN, although they don't really cover war much, but they can talk about it, you know, and nothing happens to them.  But here, for whatever reason, if you talk about it, then they want to silence you on it.  So thank you so much for your support.  I appreciate it.  Thank you for watching. ",
