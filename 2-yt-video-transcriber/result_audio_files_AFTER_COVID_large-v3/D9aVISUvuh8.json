So we think, oh, ten commandments, I'll keep them, then I'll make it to heaven.  But when we look at them, we say, man, I've violated them.  And they give us the death sentence, the soul that sins, it shall die.  And the reason I asked you if we could go through those commandments was to show you something very important, that sin to human beings is not too bad.  We all tell lies.  Who doesn't steal little things, you know?  Who doesn't use God's name in vain?  Who hasn't had sex with a girl?  Can't help it.  Everyone does it.  We just take sin lightly, but God considers sin to be so serious He gives it the death sentence.  The wages of sin is death.  We're under the death sentence because sin is so serious in the eyes of a holy God.  Now does that concern you? ",

All these things show us the genius of his handiwork and his kindness.  Plus we have a conscience.  The word conscience means with knowledge.  So all of us have a knowledge of right and wrong.  So when we lie or fornicate or blaspheme or lust or steal, we know in our heart we do wrong.  So without excuse.  So everything's against us when it comes to reality.  We know God exists.  We know we've done wrong.  And we know if God is good, there must be retribution.  God is good.  He can't let rapists and murderers go free.

Christ died on the cross for the sin of the world.  Most of us know that, but we don't know this.  The Ten Commandments are called the moral law.  You and I broke the law.  Jesus paid the fine.  That's what happened on the cross.  That's why he said it is finished just before he died, which is a weird thing to say, just before you die.  But he was saying the debt has been paid.  If you're in court, Karen, and someone pays you fine, even though you're guilty, a judge can let you go.  He can say, Karen, there's a stack of speeding fines here.  This is terribly serious, but someone's paid them.  You're free to go.  And he can do that which is legal and right and just.  Even though you're guilty, he can let you walk.  And even though you and I are guilty, because Jesus paid the fine on the cross, God can let us walk on Judgment Day.  He can let us live forever.  He can take the death sentence off us.

So if you want to know how serious sin is in God's eyes, look to the death sentence he's given all of us.  We're waiting to die.  This is a death row, this life.  It's like a judge in a court of law looks at a heinous criminal that's murdered three young girls after he raped them.  And the judge says, you have earned the death sentence.  This is your wages.  This is what's due to you.  And God has given us the wages of sin, which is death.  So Jesus died for our sins, took our punishment so God could dismiss our case, so we could walk out of his courtroom, and then he rose from the dead and defeated your greatest enemy, death itself.  The Bible says God commended his love toward us and that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.  And so what you have to do in response to what God has already done is repent of your sins, yes.  Most people can't really define repentance, but it actually means confessing and forsaking your sins.  It's like you say, I'm going to be a Christian, but I'm not going to lie and steal and fornicate and lust.  If I do that, I'll be playing the hypocrite.  I'll just be deceiving myself.  So repentance must be sincere, to be genuine.  And the second thing you must do, and this is the most important thing, is trust alone in Jesus.  See, at the moment you're like a man on the edge of a plane, 10,000 feet up.  He knows he has to jump, and this is his plan.  He's going to try and save himself by flapping his arms.  And I'd say to that man, don't do that.  Trust the parachute.  And so don't trust in your goodness to save you.  It's not going to work because you're like the rest of us.  You've got a multitude of sins.  Transfer your trust from yourself to the Savior.  The minute you put your faith in Christ, God promises he'll remit your sins because of what Jesus did on the cross.  He'll make you brand new on the inside, take you out of darkness into light.  and cause you to thirst after righteousness, which is a miracle for a sin-loving sinner.  I know you haven't agreed with what I'm saying.  I know there's a spiritual battle going on for you as a person.  Do you know who Satan is?  Do you know who he's called in the Bible? ",
