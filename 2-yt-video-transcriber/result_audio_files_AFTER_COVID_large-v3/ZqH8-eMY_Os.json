You guys have to be, I would think, a bit fuming over at the Heritage Foundation right now, looking at what's happening with our country, where voices are being stifled.  Conservatives can't even seek out and ask about information and expect to get it.  either on social media or from the mainstream media, because big tech and media is just blocking anything that supporters or the president has to say about election fraud and irregularities.

I saw that post that you're referring to where they said we should all be pretty much kicked out to the streets, never allowed, and written down so that you can never run for office and serve in public office if you're simply questioning the validity of this vote.  That makes no sense to me.  Any American has the right to question the validity of any election to make sure that it's just.  Otherwise, we're a banana republic.  I also saw the one from good old AOC that says that we've got to track down all of the Trump supporters.  And I wonder what they plan on doing to Trump supporters after.  I mean, the rhetoric that comes from the left these days, Hans, baffles me and also scares me.  Your feeling? ",

Look, that is the kind of tactics and language that fascists used in the 1930s when they started taking over countries in Europe.  and that communists also use.  And my family, I know that because my mother grew up in Nazi Germany.  My father escaped the communists twice.  And that is not the way we conduct elections or supposed to be conducting elections or politics in this country.  The fact that somebody may be a member of the opposite political party is not a reason to exile them from society and put them on blacklist.  And the fact that AOC and others are doing that kind of thing, I think is frankly shocking and it's dangerous. ",

What, if anything, is the Heritage Foundation?  You guys have been around for decades.  You've got lots of resources.  How are you guys helping with the investigation, with the legal fight?  How are you backing up conservatives to have a voice as we look into these claims of fraud? ",

And one of the things that we've done that is unique is we actually have an election fraud database that lists proven cases from across the country.  You know, every time you hear somebody at one of the mainstream networks claim, oh, there's no voter fraud, we don't need to worry about it, all you need to do is go to our database and you can see it.  Now, There are serious cases being filed.  As you probably know, in Pennsylvania, they have filed a lawsuit making a number of claims which potentially could affect the outcome of the election, including the fact that, as you know, the state Supreme Court there extended the deadline for the receipt of absentee ballots for three days after the election, even though they basically overrode state law on this.  And in court, they're asking for those ballots not to be counted because the court didn't have the power to do that. ",

I mean, come on, anybody that says it, this is another thing that just kills me, to watch all the lamestream media lapdogs every single day since last Tuesday say, there's no voter fraud.  This is just a narrative put out by Trump and his supporters.  They know damn well, we all do, there has been voter fraud, whether it's one, a hundred or a thousand votes, or in this case, maybe millions of votes.  There has been voter fraud since, and again, this is on record, I would hope, and you guys have that record, since the 50s or 60s.  Prior to that, it might've been a little hard to track it down, but we know there's been voter fraud since the 60s, correct?  Do your records go back that far? ",

The election officials, he's already pleaded guilty to this.  So the idea that, for example, fraud doesn't occur in Philadelphia is just laughable. ",

Oh, Hans, I wish we had a couple hours to talk about this because we could just start citing all of the factual evidence that has come forward from postmasters telling people to predate stuff, to an example you just gave, to poll watchers not being allowed in, to votes being changed or transcribed improperly.  I mean, the list of voter fraud and voter regularities is up there in the double digits.  It's in every battleground state.  It needs to be investigated.  And this country should not rest, should not sleep until we know that we have a fair and free legal election and legal vote count.  Hans, Von, and I hope I got it right, Spogorsky. ",
