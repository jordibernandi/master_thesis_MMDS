            "text": "Thank you.  Hey, my EMR brothers back again.  And I don't know if this is going to be a rant or a ramble.  I wait till I finish it and then we'll drop to music and see what happens.  Okay.  But this Jenny Ma thing has set off a firestorm amongst black people, especially black women.  It has exposed them in ways that It hasn't been exposed in years.  I do mean years, maybe even decades.  Where Jenny Ma exposed black women on national TV about the word submission.  Wow.  And it has sparked conversations on social media, man, all over the place, outside of the normal place where it's discussed, which is here on TV.  the black manosphere.  And we've had, you know, Valdez weigh in.  We've had Kevin Samuels weigh in.  We've even had on the other side, who's not part of the manosphere, believe it or not, Jason Black weigh in.  So we had black men of all stripes in all sectors talk about the word submission.  And you think even some of the white content creators are talking about the word submission.  And the same old prejudices that we see was with against Asian women because they are more submissive by training than most other women.  And so some of the same tropes are marched out left and right about Asian women being too soft and too aggressive.  genteel and too willing to submit.  And Jenny Ma described herself and her mother is not part of that.  They're more like tiger women.  But thing is they can switch it off because they've been trained to switch it off.  They can't do it.  I don't think black women can do it.  But that is not the subject of this video.  So let's get to it.  I was listening to Artisan MC.  Shout out to Artisan MC.  And he was actually doing what he doesn't normally do, which is discussing this Jenny Ma thing.  Why?  Because he was married to an Asian woman.  And he noticed the same things that Jenny Ma was getting bombarded by that his wife got bombarded by.  and he got bombarded by that.  he chose a wife that wanted to submit and kiss his ass and he said why is that a bad thing?  he was absolutely right.  but thing is he also said something i think is key and this is going to be the subject of the rest of this video is he said that black women understand submission very well, but they expect black men to submit, not them.  And sometimes even so-called master teacher can be taught by a student.  And the light bulb went on my head.  Bingo.  I knew it.  I knew it from the very beginning.  I've always known it.  But the thing is, until this moment, didn't have the language for it.  He's precisely right.  He put it in the correct order.  Black women pretend like they don't know how to submit.  And we've proven that they do.  Submit to a boss, submit to a white man, submit to NASA, submit to their doctor, submit to an order of things.  They submit to lots and lots of things.  The only person they won't submit to is you.  Why?  Because in their mind, they're not supposed to.  I have two gracious subs that I've had for two or three years, and I love them to death.  They just celebrated their little bitty daughter's first birthday.  Gorgeous little thing.  And gorgeous couple.  I love them to death.  I tell this story constantly since she told it to me, since Trigger told it to me.  They're walking into Walmart.  She's pregnant and she wants to go into the store and he wants to get a cart.  So all he tells you to do now, you wait, wait till I go get a cart and then we can go into the store together.  And no black woman who they don't know, they've never seen before, went past him and told her that she didn't have to listen to him.  In other words, you don't have to submit to no Negro.  You do what you want.  He submits to you.  He submits to you.  That's how come you have homosexuals and other kind of other kind of thugs and so-called bad boys that these women prefer, because I think it was Mr.  Roger today.  They're compromised and they have to submit to that woman in some shape, form or fashion because they're compromised.  So how come they don't like educated lames?  Because at some point educated lames, because of their superior position is going to make them submit.  And that goes against their training.  They're trained by their mamas, trained by their grandmas, trained by their great grandmas.  They are not supposed to submit to... any Negro.  Sometimes they say, I don't submit to any nobody but my God, but that's bullshit.  They submit to that white man all the time.  They submit to that career all the time.  They submit to them white feminists all the time.  White feminists can come push LaQuisha aside and speak for her, and LaQuisha will bow her head and get behind her.  It won't say a word, because that's the way she's been trained.  If mice are getting ready to beat the female slave, Missy can step in for, and that female slave will shut up and bow her head and do what she's told.  That's what the black feminists have done in memorial.  When white Missy comes up and tells the LaQuisha And Shaniqua and whoever to get behind me and follow me, they duck in line and get behind them and follow them.  That's their training.  But the only person they don't have to submit to and shouldn't submit to that nobody submits to is the black man.  The most unprotected, disrespected being on the planet.  And everybody knows it.  Black men by default are compromised according to black women.  It doesn't matter how much money you have.  You are still a Negro, a male Negro in this country.  And by definition, you are the designated underclass.  That's what they've been taught.  And that's what they go by.  That's how come, even though geez, he's got way more money, way more success.  In both Jenny Ma and her.  That's why Lonnie Love stared daggers at Jenny Ma saying that she's going to submit to him.  Why?  Because you're ruining up the narrative for all the other black women.  Because we've been taught as little kids growing up as black men that we don't have a right to submission.  That what black women are doing to us is normal.  That we're supposed to shut up and follow in line and do what mama tells us to do because that's the way we've been trained.  And I don't care if you had a. ",
