I would say the concept is that you use comedy to make people face their biases and their misunderstandings about things happening in culture and sexuality and gender.

We were talking about like, different frustrating things that happen as queer women.  And then I was like, okay, well let's get focused.  Like let's start writing it.  And Gabby was like, no, like let's write a sketch about this.  And so a lot of my videos have kind of like going forward from that become about the things that I find frustrating or the things that I wish people saw from my perspective.  So I like to say, I want my channel to be a resource for every like stupid question.  Or if you're like, oh, I don't know if I can ask that.  Like, I don't know if I can ask, like why do gay people need pride?

If you're offended by some of the things that I say.  playing the wife or Cameron says playing the husband, you have to remember they're directly coming from Christian teachers.  And also I want to dive into some of the more toxic Christian videos and stances because Alexis is somewhat familiar and I familiarized her even more with toxic theology while we were writing and working on this script.

I saw you struggling through this because it's something I imagine you really innately disagree with which I do too.  but at the same time you're projecting this level of respect that says if that's your belief system and that's your choice you're making an autonomous decision and I will humbly accept that as your reality and allow you to live that way without giving you a hard time about it.  So I think that's amazing.  That's a good way to be with us as Christians when we're practicing it in reverse.  Imagine in reverse if I was forced into a union with a woman.  or let's not be as extreme.  If I was forced into a union with someone, anyone that I did not connect with, that I didn't feel attracted to, that I didn't feel like I could share the depth of my secrets, that I couldn't be full and whole in my sexuality and my expression of that, then yes, I would feel incredibly lonely.  And ultimately, I believe that God does express love through the connection of sexuality and that sexuality is really important in that way.  And I don't think we should be robbing anyone of that due to genitalia.  which is really what it comes down to.  Well, thank you guys so much for listening to this conversation, especially if you made it all the way to the bitter end.  Again, this is Alexis G. Zoll.  I will attach her channel below and please go check out the video that we made together.  I do have little bits of anxiety about like, oh, am I going to come off too harsh or am I making fun of my people too much?  And I'm sure I will get those criticisms.  But at the end of the day, I do have to stand behind what Alexis Rhodes and what we did together because I do think it accurately shows how abusive and harmful these things can be that we as Christians tell our children.  I just want us to be more thoughtful about that and carve out a more positive path to how we're educating and The little ones, which is so important. ",
