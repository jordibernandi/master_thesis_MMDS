Carling was mocking the divine judicial system due to its logical inconsistency.  To hammer home his point, consider the following two criminals.  Marcus Brutus, a Roman senator who, along with his conspirators, assassinated Julius Caesar, and Genghis Khan, a Mongolian warlord who was responsible for the death of up to 40 million people.  In principle, at least, we can represent these crimes numerically.  Brutus has, say, a criminal record of 1, and Kahn has a criminal record of 40 million.  You may disagree with this assignment, and if pushed I probably would too, but I'm sure you get the point.  Now the scales of justice dictate that we issue a punishment that fits the crime, but here lies the contradiction of issuing an infinite punishment, hell, for a finite crime.  1 minus infinity is minus infinity.  That is, by definition, infinitely disproportionate.  that is not justice and it certainly isn't mercy.  it is in fact grotesquely immoral.  the same is true of course of forty million minus infinity.  to quote blaise pascal the finite is annihilated in the presence of the infinite and becomes a pure nothing.  or as the biochemist Isaac Asimov put it, infinite torture can only be punishment for infinite evil, and I don't believe that infinite evil can be said to exist even in the case of Hitler.  This was the critique that Karlin was expressing, and it is a very serious critique indeed.  The rationale behind an infinite hell is ludicrous.  I would, in fact, go further than Karlin and say that an omnipotent god that sanctions or permits an infinite punishment for a finite crime is the devil. ",
