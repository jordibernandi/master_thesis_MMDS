            "text": "Now, I'm looking at a boy having sexual intercourse with his sister.  So, they call that incest.  So, you stand back and you look at that.  And you say, now, okay, I've got to make a decision.  I've got to make an assessment about this.  And what is it?  According to compensatory logic, everything falls into one of two categories.  constructive, non-constructive.  There's no such thing as in between.  And according to most historians and most doctors and scientists, they have said that down through the years, whenever people have done that, sometimes they produce offspring, meaning babies.  And they have found that, oh, yes, you can do that, and that's what you might call family togetherness and all that.  You can put it on any kind of label, but what is the result of it?  Is it constructive or non-constructive?  And a long time ago, probably millions of years ago, I mean, people in caves and whatnot and people who are extremely primitive, they don't do that because they found out what?  You come up with a whole bunch of people sometimes that don't have arms.  They're babies born who they have brain defects.  Oh, so you have sexual intercourse with your sister, if you're a male, and that sister has a baby, it may turn out okay, but then on too many cases, No, you've got something that you've got to take care of now for the rest of your life, maybe two or three creatures.  You can't really call them functioning people.  And so they're just walking around, I mean, you know, with one arm or with a half a brain or with one eye, I mean, down near the corner of the mouth and the other eye at the top of the head.  And it's not functional.  This is not a functional creature.  I mean, you know, one eye that doesn't work right now down near the corner of the mouth and another eye at the top of the head.  I mean, they can only see it's a good eye, but it can see straight up.  It don't even move.  I mean, now, this is not what the creator probably had in mind.  So you don't commit incest.  And you give these very practical reasons.  Doesn't have anything to do with what anybody thinks or what the law says or nothing like that.  to say, hey, this is not the best arrangement.  You know, because right now the white supremacists are just dumping all kinds of stuff on black people and saying, these are wonderful arrangements.  I mean, this sexual sabotage, I mean, this is all over the place.  And that's what I call it.  I mean, for... There's a number of names I've come up with, but recently I used the term sexual sabotage because that's what it is.  We are in a war.  Do you think SSS played a part in that?  If that's what they are encouraging, because they're going to get around to doing that too.  And we have already been there, done that.  Like you were saying, some people are doing it now and always have done it, but it is not a healthy thing to do.  Every move that you make should be an improvement over movements that you made yesterday.  I don't know who originated that.  I didn't originate that, but it makes a whole lot of sense.  Every move that you make today should be an improvement over any move that you made yesterday.  Now, suppose we had a world like that among black people.  Suppose black people thought that way.  You know what?  I spent the whole day doing this and that and going here and going there.  There's a lot of stuff I did, but it wasn't no better than the stuff I did yesterday.  Now, suppose every black person say, hey, I give myself some terrible marks for that, because every day that I breathe, I'm supposed to be doing something better than everything that I did yesterday.
