            "text": "You've been on your dating apps.  You get success.  You're banging women.  A lot of 49ers.  A lot of guys will tell you that they're banging a lot of women.  But I don't mess with fat women, though.  I'm like 60% of the world, the United States is fat women.  Like your numbers statistically probably included some of them.  Just a guess.  Because you ain't banging the hot ones.  They already married.  Half of them are married.  Half of them are bipolar.  All right.  25% of women are on head meds.  Did I talk about that in my iceberg theory, okay?  So you only got like 25% of the good ones, right?  The skinny ones or whatever it is.  Got it, okay?  But you get tired of that.  You're like, I can't take another big single mom.  I wasted a lot of time.  What do I do?  Well, there's a whole bunch of life out here to live.  There's a whole bunch of value to build.  There's a whole bunch of authority.  There's a whole bunch of you can learn about men.  I was a guy that I was like, the church ain't nothing out here.  My mom used to tell me to go to church.  All I saw was a lot of rejects in there and them trying to pair them up with good men in the church.  I was like, damn.  They go on a singles retreat.  They take all the single moms and they bring all the good men in there trying to do right by the Lord.  And then guess what?  Oh, y'all pair up.  Y'all be good.  All right.  I saw that too much.  I was like, I'm done with church.  Only to figure out that what was missing was a good church, okay?  I was like, damn, we actually, that's what we needed, all right?  Now you can take the spirituality out of it, okay?  Take the religion out of it if you want.  But where a lot of this indoctrination has also come, not only from the public school indoctrination camp, but from church.  They're leading men right into the wolves, right?  So you get tired of it.  What else can I do with this life?  A lot.  Men, there is a lot to do all by yourself.  People watching you do it, all right?  That's the benefits about social media.  I'm going to do your game.  I'm going to make you watch me live this life.  And what are women going to do?  They're going to watch you and say, damn, I want to do that too.  Now, all it takes... because we're talking about low quality women, all it takes is two or three women to see some value in you.  But unfortunately, men want validation from 100% of the women out here.  Every time you walk by a woman, oh, she didn't even look at me, your self-esteem goes down.  Oh, she didn't even give me choosing signals, your self-esteem goes down.  Because all your value is in what she thinks about you.  And I'm telling you, that is not a good strategy for your life, okay?  The third thing that lets you know if you're going to be ready for this is when you're ready to see your value truly increase.
