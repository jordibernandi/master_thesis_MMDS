            "text": "Hi everyone.  so Scott Clifton aka Theoretical can't swear in the opening of a video without getting demonetized.  so Theoretical.  BS recently came back to YouTube after a very long absence.  you've been missed Scott and made a video about the modal ontological argument.  I'm linking to it below.  you should really check it out.  it's really good.  and if you don't know who Theoretical I think it's been 30 seconds, bullshit, is then seriously go check out everything he's done.  It is great.  It's about basically arguments for God and how to refute them.  And he does it so well.  But here's the thing.  His most recent video, while it's good, I think he expresses himself in a way that is... overly complicated given the subject.  I think he is addressing the modal ontological argument, which is, of course, generally considered the most sophisticated argument for the existence of God.  And he is being overly technical, I guess.  Probably a philosopher wouldn't say... A philosopher would look at it and go like, what?  This isn't technical.  This is dumbed down.  You know, any idiot could understand this.  And yeah, but I think I can make it even simpler.  So I decided I'm gonna take a stab at it.  So here we go.  Here's the argument.  Let's start with a couple of definitions.  Definition one, a maximally excellent being is one which is omnipotent, omniscient, and wholly good.  Definition two, a maximally great being is a maximally excellent being which exists in all possible worlds.  That is, it exists necessarily.  Then we have an axiom from modal logic, axiom S5, possibly necessary implies necessary.  And here's the actual argument.  1.  It is possible that a maximally great being exists.  2.  There exists a possible world in which a maximally great being exists.  3.  From Axiom S5, a maximally great being exists in all possible worlds.  4.  A maximally great being exists in our world.  5.  A maximally great being, aka God, exists.  Okay, so what's wrong with this argument?  Let's begin by looking at the first definition, the definition of a maximally excellent being.  Let's start with.  he is supposed to be or it is supposed to be omnipotent.  What the hell does that mean?  Well, the most common take on it is that it means having the ability to do absolutely anything.  If you can say it, an omnipotent being can do it.  So let's have this omnipotent being make an entirely black cat, which is entirely white.  He can do that.  Of course, that's logically impossible.  So it turns out that omnipotence is logically incoherent.  But of course, apologists have thought of this.  So they went with.  omnipotence is the ability to do everything which is logically possible.  Of course, this doesn't work either because it also leads to contradictions.  It's logically possible to make an immovable object and it's logically possible to exert an irresistible force.  So let's have... an irresistible force act on an immovable object and let's see if it really is immovable and if the force really is irresistible.  One way or another you get a contradiction.  So it turns out that having the ability to do everything that is logically possible means that you can do A, which is logically possible, and you can do B, which is logically possible in and of itself, but it contradicts A. So you can't have both abilities.  That is not logically possible.  So this actually makes it even worse, because you get a contradiction Even if you include things that are not self-contradictory.  And then you get the problem, does the ability to do everything that is logically possible fit into the list of things that are logically possible?  And that leads to Russell's paradox.  You get a contradiction no matter how you do it.  Apologists thought of this and went with, okay, fine.  Omnipotence is just having the ability to do everything that is consistent with one's essential nature.  So essentially they want to say, God can do everything that God can do.  And a rock can do everything a rock can do.  So it's also omnipotent.  Oops.  I mean a rock can lie there and be a rock and that's all it can do.  that is consistent with its nature but it can do that.  so a rock is omnipotent.  What this means is that omnipotence doesn't belong in the definition because it belongs in every definition.  It adds no information.  So remove that and we're left with A maximally excellent.  being is omniscient and wholly good.  So let's look at omniscient.  What happens if God plays chess against himself?  He knows the next move.  So he's going to make a move that negates the next move, and then he's going to go to the other side of the table, and he's not going to make that move he knew he was going to make.  So it turns out he didn't know what the next move was going to be.  Ah, but that's cheating, says the apologist, because he knew that if he makes that move then, yeah, yeah, yeah, but he didn't know what the next move would be.  He knew what it would be if blah, blah, blah.  Oh, yeah, but see, you're missing the point.  Omniscience is not knowing everything.  It's knowing everything that is knowable.  Oh, okay.  Well, what is knowable?  How do we determine what is knowable?  Turns out that omniscience simply means knows a lot.  And that's so vaguely defined that it doesn't actually add any information.  So let's remove that.  A maximally excellent being simply... Well, it's one that has the ability to do what it has the ability to do.  It knows all that it knows.  And it's wholly good.  Okay, what does wholly good mean?  Well, apologists love to point out that good means consistent with God's nature.  Oh, so it's consistent with its own nature.  So it can do what it can do, it knows what it knows, and it has the moral views that it has.  Congratulations, a maximally excellent being is completely undefined.  So I can grant the entire argument, conclude that God, the maximally great being exists, and I would still be an atheist because we have not proven the existence of a magical, anthropomorphic, immortal, intelligent, personal being which is in supernatural control of at least some aspect of nature.  you know, a God.  We've simply redefined God to mean absolutely nothing.  So everything I say from this point onward is unnecessary.  Just grant the argument, because it's not an argument for the Father of Jesus, which is what they're trying to argue for.  But then let's go with definition two.  Let's say that definition one, let's be generous and say that what they mean is that a maximally excellent being is Q from Star Trek if he decided not to be a jerk.  I mean, that's sufficiently godlike, right?  Let's go with that, just to be generous.  It's not the god that's being argued for, but neither is this vague one.  So who cares?  Now let's look at the second definition.  What this really does is it says, using pretty fancy language I guess you could say, that God exists necessarily.  Necessary existence is part of what makes something maximally great.  Okay.  Keep in mind one thing though, and that is how definitions work.  We can grant this definition, no problem at all.  It doesn't matter.  There's no point arguing with it.  There's no point nitpicking about it.  Just fine.  I'm totally cool with it.  And here's why.  I define your suitcase as being the suitcase owned by you, which contains $10 million in cash.  By definition, oh, in all possible worlds, including this one.  So go check your suitcase right now and see if that worked.  Well, it turns out that the suitcase you're looking in, which doesn't contain $10 million in cash to no one's surprise.  Well, except apologists using this argument, I guess.  It turns out that suitcase doesn't fit the definition of your suitcase.  You know, the definition I just provided you with.  That's how definitions work.  They are simply arbitrary declarations.  that with this word or phrase, I mean this.  It doesn't affect reality.  You can't define money into a suitcase.  Nor can you define a being into existence.  So I'm cool with the definition.  No problem at all.  Okay, now let's look at Axiom S5.  Because this is where most people go, okay, that's bullshit.  This doesn't work.  No, you can't say that.  But actually you can.  Because what it simply means is that in modal logic, possible means it is true in some possible world.  That is, there is a logically consistent set of circumstances under which this could be true.  World does not mean like parallel reality or something like that.  It's logical possibility, logically possible scenario.  So if it's possible, then it is true in some possible world, but not necessarily in another.  Necessary means that it's true in all possible worlds.  Examples of necessary truths are mathematical truths.  2 plus 2 equals 4, assuming that we use the definitions we're all familiar with.  Well, the truth of that follows from the definitions and axioms that are involved.  And it doesn't matter in which possible world you look at it.  Again, assuming that we don't change definitions between worlds, but that's a different thing.  So let's not worry about that.  If 2 plus 2 equals 4 in one possible world, I mean the rules are the same in every possible world, so the statement must be true in every possible world if it's true in one.  And that's really all this axiom means.  It clarifies what is meant by necessary in modal logic.  So there's absolutely nothing to object to here.  Okay, we're ready to look at the actual argument.  One, it is possible that a maximally great being exists.  It is possible that babyface Q exists.  Sure.  I can't prove that he doesn't.  I don't know for a fact that he doesn't.  So I suppose it's possible.  However unlikely I might consider it, yes, it's possible.  Sure.  Granted.  Two.  There exists a possible world in which Babyface Q exists.  Now you might think that this is just a restating of the first premise.  Okay, let's take this thing you granted and let's translate that into the language of modal logic.  But is it really?  Let me try something.  I have a paper here.  I'm going to write down an equation.  Is it possible that the equation I wrote, not some other equation, this exact equation that I wrote on this piece of paper, has the solution x equals 3?  Now obviously you're going to think that it's a trick, of course not, but maybe I'm.  Maybe I'm setting up a joke or something.  Like I'm going to show you that, yes, it really does have that solution.  But I'm messing with you.  So is it possible that the solution is x equals 3?  Yeah, it is.  It's possible.  Right?  I mean, you can't prove that it isn't.  Can you?  So I guess you're gonna have to grant that premise.  But you know what that means?  I think we already established that mathematical truths are necessary truths.  There exists a possible world in which the solution to this equation is x equals three and mathematical truths are necessary.  So that means, according to the logic used in this argument, x equals 3 is the solution to this equation in all possible worlds, including this one.  And yet, I think even the not so mathematically gifted among you can tell that x equals 3 does not solve this equation.  So what happened?  What went wrong?  It was premise 2.  There is no possible world in which x equals 3 solves this equation.  But it was possible that I wrote x equals 3 or something else that could be solved by x equals 3, right?  We're talking about two different kinds of possibility.  There's possible as in, I don't know that it's impossible.  And there's possible as in, yes, there is a possible world when this is the case.  There is no possible world in which the equation I wrote can be solved that way.  But you didn't know that when I asked you the question.  Given everything you knew, it was possible.  It was epistemically possible.  But it wasn't logically possible.  But you had no way of knowing that.  So in premise one and premise two, possible means different things.  And this whole argument is grounded in logic.  equivocation fallacy.  You don't get to switch what you mean from one premise to the next when you're using the same term.  You can't do that.  This is just an attempt to obfuscate the cheat by using fancy language.  Hey, let's restate this into modal logic.  Well, most people don't know anything about modal logic, so they won't catch that you're introducing something new in the translation, something you haven't agreed to.  It's an equivocation fallacy.  And it turns out that the most sophisticated argument for the existence of God is nothing more than a word game.  See ya. ",
