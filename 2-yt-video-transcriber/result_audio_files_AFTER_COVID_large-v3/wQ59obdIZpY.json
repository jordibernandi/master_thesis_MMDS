            "text": "Hey everyone.  I was recently asked to comment on a phenomenon called Project Melody.  I had to go look it up, and then I had to spend the next 24 hours laughing my fucking ass off.  So, let me position myself first.  Yo, sickos.  I mean, state my position, not assume one.  I have to admit that at first glance, I thought Project Melody was a man posing as a woman.  And to be honest, I'd love that to be true.  One thing I'm fairly certain of is that men are behind the technology that may put real cam girls out of business right now.  Unlike normal hentai, Melody is able to respond in real time interactively, so that's what puts her in the cam girl circuits.  I did watch a live interview with her in which the voice, which is incredibly cute, geeky, and all the other forms of innocence that appeal to men, she's delightful.  And it convinced me that there's probably a woman somewhere behind that technology.  But I think she's just really the voice.  I remember when I was much younger and a friend of mine took a course and got hired to do a job as a sex line operator.  I know what she actually looked like and hmm.  Well, let me put this in a nice way.  Someone else would have had to do the movements that brought that anime character to life.  Having said that, I don't intend on discouraging people from whacking off to Project Melody, especially when it can take dollars away from other cam girls, and it's possible that men are primarily making money off of this particular weakness.  But what I would do is encourage you to test Melody's limits.  On the other hand, knowing all this is a way to make men spurt for money, be careful how much money you spend on this project.  And make sure, if you're being a brave soldier and participating in this experiment, that you keep sufficient lube nearby.  What I would recommend above all else is that those who engage with melody study the phenomenon closely and report back on how your weaknesses are being exploited.  In the meantime, the whole of hentai is driving feminists absolutely nuts trying to figure out how to shut it down.  Just like sex robots, I'm sure they'll come up with a theory about how animations can be sexually exploited and raped.  It's just a matter of time. ",
