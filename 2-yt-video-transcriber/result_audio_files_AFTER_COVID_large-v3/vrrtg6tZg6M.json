            "text": "recently my husband found out because he went through my phone and saw a video the guy had sent me of us two.  he said we need to get a divorce that he no longer wants me since i was used by someone else.  what's going on everybody?  hope everybody's feeling good.  hope everybody's doing well.  we are back with another story guys.  i will put the link to this in the description.  like usual you guys read the title.  let's get into it.  so i was caught cheating.  okay She starts off with, so I am a 33 year old female and my husband is 32.  We have been together for about nine years total.  In three of these years, married.  Our relationship was perfectly fine and it was all good.  Every once in a while, we got into small arguments, but got over it.  Last year, I started seeing this guy at my job and he was 23 years old.  This guy seemed very attracted to me and I enjoyed the attention I was getting from new people.  Eventually, we started having sex and I kept on seeing him a lot.  Recently, my husband found out because he went through my phone and saw a video the guy had sent me of us two having sex.  My husband saved the video to his phone.  I didn't know he had done that until one day I got home and I was calling him and asking if he was almost home from work.  He replied with, I'm staying at my brother's house for a while.  His older cousin, they are like brothers to each other.  He continued with, I can't even look you in the face.  I was asking him why, why he didn't want to see me.  And then that's when he sent me the video.  I was in total shock and I broke down crying.  I started spamming with messages and calls that I was so sorry and please just forgive me.  He didn't reply at all.  I stopped by his cousin's home and nobody was there.  Then I was asking his cousin's wife where he was and she was asking me why I was in tears and what happened between us two.  I told her I couldn't talk and she said they went and threw a party at the other house and she stayed because she was feeling kind of sick.  I rushed there and I saw my husband there.  I rushed to him and went on my knees and I tried to hug him.  He looked broken down and he was drinking a lot.  He then walked away from me and left to his truck.  There I saw a mutual friend of ours and I knew she had a thing for him because she told me a while ago.  She looked angry at me and told me I didn't deserve such a man.  I ran to my husband's truck and she followed behind me.  My husband slammed the door on my face and our mutual friend held me back and said to leave him alone for a while.  He then left to his cousin's house and he went to the extra home he had in the back.  That night I went home and slept by myself.  In the morning I stopped by the house.  he was staying in and walked in since I thought he was alone and I saw him in bed with our friend who liked him.  She saw me and I immediately tried to kick her butt but his cousin ran and held me back.  since they heard me screaming and yelling.  I sat down with her after to have a chat and was asking what the heck she was doing with my man.  She seemed calm and laughed in my face saying I was going to lose him and how he was going to be hers.  I didn't talk to my husband after and I left back to our home and I cried for hours until I decided to talk to him.  We walked and I tried to get him back but he seemed brain dead and he was upset.  Now he is staying with that other bee and sleeping with her.  He said we need to get a divorce, that he no longer wants me since I was used by someone else, and that I should go stay with the guy.  I was effing.  Is there any way I can get him back?  Or how can I show him he should pick me over the other girl?  This is really killing me and I miss him very much.  I am really frustrated and feel lonely without him coming home or with him not being around me.  I really need help.  I am losing myself in emotions and I want to feel him around me and I want him to make me feel safe again just like he used to.  Wow.  Let me give my thoughts.  It was all fun and games when she was messing with the younger guy at work.  Oh, she was getting so much attention.  This younger guy made her feel good.  You know, her husband wasn't kissing her on the back of the neck when she cooked eggs anymore.  So she felt like she wanted to be single.  So she went out and did some very, very bad things.  And this young guy was even sending videos of them getting it in.  Husband finds out.  He moves on quickly.  That's that's how he got over it.  He went and stepped out with somebody else and she's upset.  Now she wants him back.  Look at it.  She's chasing him now.  Oh, he found someone quickly.  Now, if he was sitting there moping and crying and I don't know what to do.  I love you so much.  And here's some flowers and candy.  Let's go on vacations.  She kept.  she would keep.  she would keep doing it.  If she if he got rid of this new girl and said, OK, I don't want a divorce.  I'll stay with you.  She'll eventually do it again.  She only wants him because she sees that he moved on very quickly.  That's very obvious.  She would have never stopped doing what she was doing if he didn't find out.  She was never going to tell him.  That was her side piece.  She had a marriage.  I don't know if he was paying everything, but he was paying enough to where it made things comfortable for her.  She didn't want to screw that up.  That's why she doesn't want this divorce anymore.  And she has the nerve to ask for, you know, help on how to keep him.  Like, you clearly don't want him.  You clearly don't love him that much.  Clearly.  You're upset that this new girl got a hold of him.  The new girl is saying, or the friend, the mutual friend.  And she's saying he's a great guy.  You're stupid for doing what you did.  And you feel dumb.  You just don't want that girl to have him.  You don't really want your husband.  You want that 23-year-old.  Or you want what your husband can provide.  You messed up.  You have to suffer the consequences.  It is what it is.  Let's check out the comments.  Someone said, play stupid games and win stupid prizes.  Someone else said, you were 33?  This is some high school drama.  Right.  You're trying to fight the girl.  You're cheating with a 23 year old.  Grow up.  You're an adult now.  Be an adult.  Someone said, you effed up and there's no real way to fix this.  He wants a divorce and he has no reason not to want one.  Absolutely.  Someone else said, you have been cheating since last year and even recording it.  What did you think was going to happen?  that your husband would never find out?  Your husband watched a video of you having sex with someone else and then had revenge sex to hurt you.  It's over.  He will never get that image out of his head.  Go see your family and friends.  Seek sympathy and support.  Get drunk and prepare for divorce.  Maybe remember not to cheat on the guy you love next time.  She replied and said, I tried to look for help with family and friends, but it seems word is out that I cheated and everybody seems upset with me.  Well, those are the consequences you have to deal with.  like clearly clearly she didn't think about like if i get caught.  she didn't think about none of that.  she just wanted that instant pleasure from somebody else.  someone said nope nope it's over.  why would you cheat when your marriage is perfect to begin with?  thank you.  someone said ha ha ha ha wow you effed up.  what are you doing with a 23 year old kid when you're a grown woman with a husband pathetic roll the eff up absolutely.  Someone else said, sorry girl, but you effed up.  Cheating is just wrong.  No one deserves to be cheated on.  It's a terrible feeling.  Put yourself in his shoes and think about how you'd feel if you were him.  She replied to that and said, I know how he feels, but I want to fix this.  Yeah, she knows because he went out and he did the same thing to her.  He started sleeping with the friend, right?  She felt horrible.  She felt horrible.  And she knows exactly if the shoe was on the other foot and he did it first or he did it to her, she would feel upset.  And she would probably try to take everything from him.  Someone said, you're a loser.  Your husband is doing exactly what he should.  I hope he doesn't take you back.  Someone else is saying, this is a really tough situation.  First of all, you need to own up to what you did.  You need to sincerely apologize for breaking the sanctity of marriage by sleeping with a 23-year-old guy behind his back.  Were you just going to sweep it under the rug and act like it never happened?  Did you feel guilt?  As far as I know, he was faithful to you the entire time and he put his trust in you while you were continually breaking his trust to the highest degree.  Let's say the roles were reversed.  You were the one who was faithful and never slept with your coworker, but you had to find a video in his phone of him having sex with that girl you were talking about in your post.  You would be absolutely livid.  Would you take him back?  Someone that knowingly stepped out of the marriage to pleasure themselves and did it on multiple occasions?  It would take every part of you and more to put all that aside and make it work again because when the trust is broken, it's a hell of an ordeal to get it back.  In some cases, you can't.  You need to accept that.  I don't want to be rude and I don't want to be mean, but this is your fault.  You need to give it time.  You need to show him that you changed and you have to show him that you are legitimately and genuinely remorseful and apologetic towards your actions.  This is not something that's going to happen overnight.  It may take months or even longer.  She replied to that and said, Someone's asking, Do you regret the cheating or that you got caught?  What you did is really not an okay thing to do to anyone.  And I understand why he is upset as he is.  I'd reflect on what it was that made you cheat.  If it was as simple as there's a hot guy interested in you, there's no guarantee that you won't do it again.  Trust was broken here, and it may never be fixed.  Give him space, lots of it, and then you can attempt to have a conversation with him.  Don't beg for him back.  You effed up and really may not deserve to get him back.  But have a conversation.  Maybe he'll agree to intensive couples therapy, but the power's out of your hands now.  You decided to cheat knowing the potential  consequences.\".  She replied and said, I regret the cheating.  And it's just that when somebody else gave me attention, it made me feel wanted.  I wanted to make sure I was still good looking and I needed to hear from someone else other than my husband.  And on that note, I'm going to say you don't deserve him.  You'll do it again.  You'll absolutely do it again.  Because you're going to always need constant reassurance.  Am I still pretty?  He stopped kissing me on the back of the neck.  No, no, it's over.  It's a wrap.  Guys, let me know what you think about this in the comments.  I'll put the link to this in the description like usual.  And let me know what you think about this and I'll catch you guys at the next one. ",
