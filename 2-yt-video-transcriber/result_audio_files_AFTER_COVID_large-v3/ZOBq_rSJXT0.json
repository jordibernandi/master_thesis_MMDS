            "text": "So today is moving day.  I am getting up out of Washington and this is the beautiful weather that Washington decided to give me as a going away present.  But I want to give a quick shout out to Brian McKnight.  He's saying great praises, you know.  gripey night singer you get it for you pack and it was.  it was because of him.  i went ahead and went with you pack and trusting them to you know get my belongings across country.  i want to also talk about jay and m movers out of tacoma washington great customer service black owned business also veteran owned and operated my fellow navy brother.  so you know i gotta sing them their high praises and give them a great review.  so this is going really well as I am getting up out of Washington.  So yeah, if you're needing to move, call UPAC.  And it's so funny because ABF, that was my rate in the Navy.  Hey, this is Tyesha, and I am back with another great video in a series on leaving Washington and, you know, heading, actually moving across state.  Well, not across state, across country.  So today was actual move out day, and my move has been so stress-free up to this point.  And I want to talk about moving companies and the best price that I found.  Um, so I knew that I was not going to drive to U-Haul.  I'm currently in U-Haul and I'll get to that later on.  I knew that I was not going to drive my belongings across country.  I knew there were certain things I had that I was not willing to sell and, you know, just start over.  So, um, first I started out and this was like a last minute move.  You know, when I got notification, I accepted the job offer.  I had exactly two weeks to move across country.  So I've taken a week to pack and another week to drive across country.  I called a couple of companies that were local moving companies to see how much it would cost to have movers come out, just load their truck with my stuff, drive across country, and then unload it.  And the most expensive quote was $4,500.  And that was for a queen-size bedroom set.  And I have living room furniture, but it's not heavy.  It's the two wingback chairs, the blue chair I'm always filming in when I'm at home.  And I have like a waiting room, not even a two-seater, it's a one-cushion couch.  I don't have coffee tables.  I don't have, you know, entertainment stand, nothing like that.  I don't have lamps.  And I just have a library.  And the person that came out, you know, looked at my books.  And they went into my, even though I had a two-bedroom condo, one bedroom.  when my son isn't there, it's my studio.  And all of my studio equipment collapses down into a duffel bag.  And so I'm just hearing $4,500.  And it was estimated I had, let's say, I think she said 3,800 pounds.  And I remember, you know, moving across country when I was an active duty spouse, all that stuff that we had, yeah, we had a lot.  And it was five of us.  We had a lot of clutter and junk.  I'm like, ain't no way I got that much weight.  So with that quote right there, when other companies will call and want to set up an appointment or a consultation, a walkthrough, I'm like, look, If so, before I get there, after the first person came out and did their walkthrough and quoted me $4,500, I got a phone call because I put my name in this little, this search engine thing to get contacted for a move.  And the person that contacted me was with UPAC.  And I remember UPAC because Brian McKnight did a great review about UPAC on Instagram.  And so if Brian McKnight, you know, can give them rave reviews, it must be worth it.  So I could not get a pod or a container at the condo because they wouldn't allow it, just acting, you know, like stupids.  But it's okay.  The gentleman said, hey, let's try to make this move.  And I was like, yo, I just got a quote for this much.  If you can't beat it, we can't even have a conversation.  So he's like, let's see what we can do.  I'm like, really?  I have just a one bedroom apartment.  I don't have a washer and dryer.  I don't have yard furniture.  I don't have living room tables.  I don't have any of that is just what I described.  So he gave me a certain number of feet in the U-Haul trailer.  And I get another U-Haul in the, it's not UPAC, but it's ABF.  And that was my rate in the Navy.  Oh my gosh, it's such a coincidence with this move.  Like things have been so... universally in line with this move.  So ABF, my son was getting loaded onto an ABF trailer.  So he quoted me a number of feet for me to load all of my stuff.  And that's to load the entire, I think it's like 13 and a half feet high and a certain number of feet out, $1,700.  I'm like, okay, go ahead and take my information.  I'll pay for it now.  And after I did that, I knew that all I had to do was hire moving help.  So he was saying what I had to do was get my belongings here to the port of Tacoma to load into the trailer.  So I went, I already went, well, then I went to U-Haul and reserved a 15-foot truck.  That's what I'm sitting in right now.  And then I went to, I think it's moving help through U-Haul.  I had... Well, first, before, I knew I was going to do the moving help, but I wanted to price shop.  Somebody said go to Craigslist and get help.  A gentleman was on there for... A gentleman was offering his services just himself for $35 an hour, which I'm like, okay.  And then I called the College Hunks Moving Junk.  I called them.  Oh, my gosh.  She charged me an arm and a goddamn leg, like almost $200 an hour for two helpers.  i'm like for what i'm not paying off their student loans.  okay yeah i was like no ma'am she was like for five hours of moving it and that's with my u-haul.  like it was higher if i provided my own truck cheaper with their truck but i had to pay.  it was like she's like seven Like $700 to $800.  I'm like, hell no.  And then I had to start paying them when they left their office.  I'm like, no, ma'am.  You can go ahead and lose my information.  Um, what else?  So I went to moving help with U-Haul and the first company that came up is they're right here with me now.  J and M movers.  They are the absolute freaking best.  I'm going to give them the best freaking review on, on, uh, on U-Haul's website.  Um, he actually helped me save money because I had actually put the information in to reserve this date incorrect.  And I was like overcharged, like $200.  He called me back, walked me through it, confirmed.  Brother is on point.  Like, oh my gosh.  And plus I was so happy that when they arrived, I kind of knew on the phone, I kind of like knew it.  But when they showed up in person today, Black-owned business.  And not only that, Black-owned, veteran-owned, operated business.  Oh, my gosh.  Yes, him and his partner have been so respectful, so courteous, so kind, professional, working hard like a mother-brother, okay?  On top of what I'm paying them, they're about to get almost all the cash in my purse as a tip.  Like, I really appreciate them.  J&M Movers, they're based out of here in Tacoma.  U-Haul has been great, making the reservation, going back and forth, buying boxes.  They also buy back the unused boxes.  I don't need this box, so I'm going to get my dollar back.  Yeah, I know I'm being petty and dollar, but every dollar counts when you're doing a move like this.  And so, yeah, UPAC, I'm here.  They were easily located.  So, yeah.  No hidden charges.  So I'm kind of, I'm not stressed.  I'm not panicked at all.  I'm really calm.  I'm really cool.  As far as when I get to where I'm going, my destination, you'll find that out later.  I just have to do the same thing.  I'll go and reserve a 15 foot truck at U-Haul.  I'll go to moving help, get some helpers and unload it to where I'm going.  But this has been so stress-free.  Like I have no stress up to this point.  And I've been really drained.  I've been really, really drained, you know.  So that's pretty much all I got to say about the moving.  What I'm about to talk about right now or in a little bit, I'll put on a different video.  But I know you came here to find out, you know, what tips and tricks you can do to keep the move low.  Like I said, make sure you declutter.  Declutter is a must.  I had just a whole bunch of stuff at the house, and I pretty much filled up two dumpsters.  I got tired of stuff.  I just started throwing stuff away, selling stuff.  Yes, um... Before you try to take the goodwill or if it's really bulky furniture and try to move it, take a picture of that stuff and get rid of it.  Furniture is meant to kind of... If it's not like antiques and have value, it's just meant to circulate around that immediate area and you get rid of it, okay?  Driving this U-Haul, I have so much respect for truckers.  Like, I really do.  As I'm driving across country now, I want to put some respect on them 18 wheels because... Um, boy, the high winds across the Tacoma Narrows Bridge.  I was over there shaking and I couldn't figure out, you know, like it took me a while to kind of get into my groove and drive.  But yeah, this ain't no way I could have drove this across country.  I was like tense the whole drive.  But that is about it.  I mean, if you have any questions about the move, like I said, I want to just shout out Tyler.  I believe he said he's here in Tacoma or it just may be a national name and whatever.  But Tyler, will you pack?  Everybody at the U-Haul in Bremerton, they were super excellent.  Right here, right freaking here, J&M Moving Service of Tacoma, Washington.  Man, y'all better put some respect on their names.  So yeah, that's about it.  I'm going to start rambling and I'm just going to sit here while the truck is getting unloaded.  And I'm going to actually take some pictures and show you just how we're unloading it.  He said they can have this unloaded in like 30 minutes.  So hang on one second.  So this is how we are unloading the U-Haul into the ABS pack with U-Pack.  And they're just walking back and forth, taking it right off into the other one.  This is like super brilliant.  They are doing the GD thing.  All right.  So I'm going to pick up this trash right here.  That's not off the truck.  But yeah, the truck is almost empty.  Like, they are moving the truck.  It's pretty much empty.  That's just boxes.  So they are doing the dang thing.  I'm giving y'all a great review.  Are you on Instagram, too?  Facebook, anything like that?  I'm giving y'all one hell of a review, okay?  Thank you.  And this is Josh.  He's the owner, operator, and veteran.  Love him.  And that's his partner.  I think his name is Mason.  There you go.  Thank you.  And that's about it.  So we're here with you, Pac.  doing the dang old thing all right so I'll see y'all in the next video. ",
