            "text": "Hi, can I have your name and batch number, please?  Yeah, my name is Officer Barnes with Claremont Police Department.  My batch number is 266.  What's going on?  i need to make sure i'm not in that.  i'm sorry you're videotaping.  i'm not in that.  i'm sorry you are in it.  i need to be off.  i don't want to be in it.  you didn't ask my permission and i don't want it.  do i need your permission?  yeah you're gonna post it somewhere.  yeah since when you're gonna post a video of me standing around well we're not at your house or in your property.  i don't want you filming me.  do you know about the first amendment?  Yes, but I don't want you filming me, and I'm telling you, I don't want you filming me, so you need to delete it.  Same for you, too.  Well, maybe if you don't want to be filmed, ma'am, the post office is the last place you should be.  There's cameras everywhere.  I'm sorry.  Okay, that is for personal.  I'm sorry, for business.  You're doing it for personal reasons.  How do you know?  What are you taping it for?  Business.  What do you do?  I don't answer questions, ma'am.  Okay, then obviously it's not for business.  It is for business, but I don't have to discuss my day with you, ma'am.  Call the cops.  Hold on.  Now I'm breaking the law.  Look.  Because y'all got multiple people out here videotaping and nobody told them I don't want to be in it.  Okay, ma'am.  Okay, ma'am.  Please don't call the police.  I am.  Why?  Because I'm telling you to delete it.  I don't want to be whatever it is you're doing.  Do you think I'm breaking the law right now?  But I'm telling you I do not want to be in whatever it is you're doing.  How am I breaking the law?  Out of respect.  So, yeah, I'm going to call the cops.  Then call the cops.  Let's play the Hunger Games.  It's just a video, ma'am.  There's no reason.  I know, but some people don't want to be out there.  And I didn't do anything wrong, so I don't want to be in it.  If you've done nothing wrong, you are.  You're trying to stop me from my First Amendment.  You are doing something wrong.  Yes, I'm at the Claremont Post Office, and this guy keeps videotaping me as I'm trying to mail out, and he's still videotaping me.  And I told him I don't want to be in it, and he won't delete it.  So I need somebody to come out here, please.  Ma'am, do you know what a Karen is?  Do you know what a Karen is?  You're calling the cops on me for no reason, ma'am.  What do you think about this?  Well, most people don't.  They think that you have to blur your face or that they don't have the right to film.  These people don't realize that the National Security Agency illegally spies on us with trillions of dollars.  Nobody complains about that.  Nobody calls the cops.  And we're in a weird world where people actually call the police on the First Amendment, something that people give their lives for.  And he's still videotaping it.  I'm calling the cops.  Ma'am, I don't want to be rude to you, but we absolutely have the right to record.  If you don't want to be on video, ma'am.  I've done nothing to you either.  Have I been rude to you?  Have I been rude to you?  Ma'am, I don't know you.  You're giving me orders.  You should just walk away.  That's fine.  That's fine, ma'am.  This is America.  It's a free country.  Unfortunately, ma'am, you don't have... I'm not gonna say it while I have people videotaping me.  Ma'am.  Ma'am, do you know what a Karen is?  You're acting like a Karen, ma'am.

We're closing the year 2020 with Post Office Karen.  She's calling the police army over a video camera.  So... Hopefully, she gets educated on the First Amendment and the rules and regulations from the Post Office, which are clearly marked right here.  Now, we haven't gone to this part yet, but the rules of the Post Office regarding photographs is right here.  It's called Poster 7.  Poster 7 clearly states that photographs for news purposes may be taken in entrances, lobbies, foyers, corridors, or auditoriums.  Okay?  Auditing America pays a lot of money in taxes, which means we're doing this for business.  Hi, how are you?  Do you have a problem with my video recording in this place?  What do you think about the rules right there, though?  The rules say that we can't.  Okay.  Fair enough.  How you doing, sir?  Let me listen to her first so you can stay here.  Sure.  But please don't interrupt her.  I'll let you speak afterwards.  Awesome.  I don't want to record it either.  I want to speak to you while I'm recording.  I'm recording to you.  I will not speak to you while he's recording.  You want to go over here?  Yeah.  Give us some privacy, okay?  I'll be nice to you, but I could go over there too if I want to.  So I know it may be a little annoying for you and other people, Yes, yes, it is.  This is the post office, Karen.  Make sure you find us on Auditing America, all right?  Yes, sir.  Tell me your side, sir.  Can I have your name and batch number, please?  Officer Col\u00f3n.  Col\u00f3n.  Nice to meet you, man.  What's going on?  Just exercising a constitutional protected right to freedom of speech, freedom of the press.  What was your batch number?  I'm sorry?  165.  165, okay.  Anything else?  Did you explain to her that we absolutely have the right to be in here and video record?  Her side.  Did you hear her side?  What's her side?  She just feels annoyed by it.  She feels like.  And our intention was never to bother her.  She's the one that started getting comfortable.  You're not hovering over her, right?  No, no, she approached us.  She approached them like I was in there when it all happened.  I was right behind them all.  And we don't know this guy, by the way.  Just remember people's personal space, you know?  Absolutely.  There are certain case studies and all that where if someone feels a little intimidated because of your physical space, they might react.  And now you get into a situation where you might win or lose, but sometimes you lose, okay?  What do you mean win or lose?  I don't know.  Are you talking about like a disorderly conduct charge or something?  Yeah.  I have a question for you.  Physically, physically.  Be careful with that.  So is there a physical intimidation charge?  It could be.  It depends on the person's perspective.  Okay, so it really... You got to be careful with that.  Okay, so when specifically does like the First Amendment start and disorderly conduct begin?  We can talk about that later.  We're not talking about that right now.  What's your address?  I'll come by with tacos and beer.  I'll be back.  Okay, sounds good.  Are you guys in line doing business here?  Yes.  Also, you can explain to possibly the employees from the post office about poster seven, the rules and regulations from the post office.  They're right here on the wall.  Clearly says that we're allowed to video record just like you said.  I was trying to guide her to the rules and regulations, but she wasn't having it.  But yeah, we're going to make the line.  Just be very mindful of people's personal space.  Oh, yeah.  Very important.  Absolutely.  Okay, guys, please stay safe.  You're very nice, Col\u00f3n.  Take care.  Thank you for standing up for our rights.  Appreciate it.  Hi, can I have your name and badge number, please?  yeah my name is officer barnes with claremont police department.  my bad number is 266. what's going on today?  nice to meet you.  nothing we're just taking.  it was a misunderstanding.  we're taking some pictures.  lady was annoyed that we were taking pictures all right.  cologne over here is um letting her know that we absolutely have to write.  thank you right there.  the video record almost got it right there though.  yeah they got it thank you.  we have the right to video record in a public place.  this is a federal facility.  The Constitution is a federal document, so we're all safe here.  Our rights should be safer here than anywhere else.  You are.  You are not wrong.  Can you do me a favor?  Can we step over to the sidewalk just so we don't get hit by any cars?  Sure, let's go.  I appreciate that.  We'll be right over there.  Are we being detained?  No.  Awesome.  Right now you're over here.  We're going to come talk with you in a second, okay?  Okay, thank you.  Can I get a name and badge number?  I'm Officer Wilkins, badge number 224.  224, thank you, sir.  And you, sir?  Officer Barnes, 266.  266, thank you very much.  My man.  Hopefully we get to try that out later unless you're a strap.  Hey, I paid for that taser.  Yo, this dude's sparking a split right in front of the figs in a non-legal state.  This is a revolutionary right here.  I love this.  Yes.  It's so funny that it's illegal to have... No, cops don't really fuck with you about weed out here.  As long as you don't, like, have a lot.  And this guy's building a skate channel, right?  Aren't you?  What's the name of your channel?  Young Skates.  Young Skates?  Young Skates, I'm watching.  Did you inform them on their own rules?  What do you mean inform them?  Well, I asked them, is it OK if I record just to see if they know their own rules?  The rules are right there on the wall.  The regulations from the post office is poster seven.  And there's a section for photographs for news purposes.  So I guess they got on if they knew it.  I don't know who called the cops.  Maybe maybe the other girl did.  They're not complaining.  Awesome.  All right.  Awesome.  No, you guys are.  And you're and you're very nice guy, man.  We we.  We have a lot of police interactions and a lot of them, even though we do nothing wrong, we still get like, you know, treated unfairly sometimes.  But you guys are great.  Thank you so much.  Yeah, it's not a problem.  We're going to go talk to her and see what she needs.  But like I said, right now, she's already gone.  But yeah, like I said, you guys are within your right to record.  So you got no people.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you, officer.  That's what we love to hear.  It's our right.  Free press.  We're bringing awareness on freedom of the press.  A lot of people think First Amendment is just free speech.  They don't know that we have freedom of religion.  You want to believe that your God is a monkey or a horse?  Come to America.  We are done.  I'll call us.  Thank you.  We'll see you around, okay?  Awesome.  Take care.  Merry Christmas.  What?  What?  Oh, he did that in your face, bro.  He did that in your face, bro.  That guy is... He just don't give a damn.  Oh, that was a Karen?  Yeah.  Oh, she's mad we didn't go to jail?  She's mad that she hasn't been told that... You know what I'm saying?  That there's no expectation of privacy in public.  Oh, she did the walk of shame.  And that's why... That's why Mr.  America does what he does. ",
