You know, I've about had it with these Fox News Trump Republicans who think they have a monopoly on patriotism, who think that they have cornered the market on love of country.  They scream and yell about cancel culture and liberals being averse to other viewpoints.  But they are the ones who require allegiance in their particular way.  Their flavor of patriotism is the only one that's allowed.  Tucker Carlson last night took to his stupid Fox News program and attacked, not just Joe Biden, he attacked Tammy Duckworth.  veteran, disabled veteran, lost both of her legs fighting for this country.  And he asserted that she hates America.  Before he did so though, He called Donald Trump's speech in front of the Mount Rushmore.  He called it eloquent.  Need I remind anyone how the speech went?  Need I remind you that Donald Trump can't even string together sentences when they're written down on a teleprompter inches from his face?  Remember this moment. ",
