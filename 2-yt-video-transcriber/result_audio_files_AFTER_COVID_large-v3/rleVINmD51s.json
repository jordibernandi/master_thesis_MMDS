            "text": "Depending on what time I get out here, if it's three or four, I notice the houses in the neighborhood.  Some have TVs on in what I identify as bedrooms.  I know where the bedrooms are in these houses.  They're usually above the garage or a lot of the garages have been Bricked up and turned into offices.  An extra bedroom, that kind of thing on the first floor, but above them are usually bedrooms.  And I see the blue flashing light.  People needing the TV.  Think about this.  People needing the TV to fall asleep.  What the heck?  You know why?  Because of the noise.  The chatter in their life.  During the day, you need noise to fall asleep.  These are the people that have a TV on in every room, a radio on.  They can't get in the car and drive in silence.  These are the people that have to have noise.  And what kind of noise is it?  Nine times out of ten, it's news.  The blue flashing light puts people in a trance, puts people to sleep without noise and the blue flashing light of the television.  They can't sleep.  They can't be awake.  They can't thrive.  They can't live.  Interesting.  Stirring the coffee with chopsticks using the vortex method, the only true way to optimize the taste of your coffee at the molecular level.  Good morning.  Welcome to the Daybreak Show.  I am the Sultan.  We'll get started, but first, mushroom coffee, because it is Mushroom Coffee Monday.  Perfect.  Mushroom coffee Monday.  Yeah, you should have a mushroom coffee Monday.  I actually dried some mushrooms over the weekend.  in the dehydrator, and then I put them in the coffee grinder thing, the electric one, and reduce them down to a very, very fine powder.  And then I take a half a teaspoon of the mushrooms and put them in my coffee and blend them with a little hand frother thing.  Just makes it creamy.  So just something for a little flavor, richness, and also the mushrooms have a nootropic effect.  You know, I feel like sometimes when I'm talking, I am imitating Greg's garage as he's imitating me.  I didn't realize there's a new video out.  I watched it yesterday and I laughed the whole time.  I'm going to have to put a link for it down below.  He's the guy that does a parody of me doing the Daybreak Show.  And it's pretty funny.  Pretty funny.  A woman says to me that she's a huge animal lover.  That can mean one of three things.  Think about it.  I'm a huge animal lover.  It could mean that she likes elephants and giraffes.  She really likes huge animals.  Or it could mean that she likes animals a lot.  She's a huge animal lover.  Or three, it means she needs to cut down on the Cinnabons.  She's a huge animal lover.  I thought that was funny.  Here's a profound statement by my friend Marianne Elizabeth.  She is a working model and you've seen her everywhere on everything.  She talks about aging.  I get that it is popular to be pro-age and I'm on board with owning my own age, but isn't it also okay to be honest and say how intimidating aging really is?  Some days I wish I had my 20-something body because now I'm wise enough to appreciate it.  Back then I was too busy criticizing myself for every little imperfection.  It wasn't until I grew and birthed my babies to realize how powerful my body was and I fully appreciate it.  I'm not saying that women have to bear a child to know this truth.  What I am saying is that we need to be kind to ourselves as we are to our friends.  Aging has taught me to be kinder, more accepting of myself, and that I am still a work in progress.  That's a good word.  That was from probably 2016, something like that.  And she transitioned to fully gray.  Here's a pop quiz.  Name the mobster.  I'll give you a hint.  The Philly mob.  Put your answer down below.  Man, you need to be a rock.  The woman in your lives right now, or the woman in your life right now, is worried about the upcoming election.  Lead your family and your circle of influence with a peaceful, calm disposition.  Some of you that are on social media have watched some of the ladies panic.  And they're watching too much television and reading too much social media.  Reading the hype.  Believing the lies.  Men, be the rock.  Be a rock.  Presidential elections should not be terrifying or scary.  It's something to celebrate.  Ballots, not bullets.  Let's make that clear.  That leads me to say this.  Never believe the polls.  100% of polls are propaganda.  America wants law and order, and it's not okay to burn cities down.  It's not okay.  It's not okay to have political lockdowns and wear masks that have nothing to do, have nothing to do with a you-know-what.  Travel is shut down.  The patriots have had enough.  I'm not even remotely worried.  Relax.  What about men who are not able to have kids, truly not able to have children?  And I say a fatherhood is in your heart.  Your desire does not have to be unfulfilled.  You may encounter a single mother whose children don't have a father in their life, which is rare.  And you might be the most amazing stepfather and make a massive difference.  And I know there's video after video after video of stay away from single moms.  Not all single moms are made of the same material.  Many times there are widows.  Many times there are people who made a mistake.  Men and women.  Sometimes with women that mistake bears a child.  It was a mistake being with that guy, but the children are not a mistake.  Children are not a mistake.  So what are you going to do?  Ignore them?  No.  As a single man, you don't have to marry a woman who has kids.  No one's forcing you to do that.  But they are all different.  Everyone is different.  And there's different reasons for things.  And that's why you date long.  You find out the reasons for things.  I would not normally recommend marrying a single mother at all.  But there's that rare case where I know young people, teens, 20s, and 30s, who have said that they had a magnificent stepfather in their life.  And it's not the fear of single mothers that makes me live in fear and cynicism about single mothers.  It is the awe that I have for these young people that were raised by a selfless man who took on a role.  I'm not talking plow horse either, because I'll debate any one of you schlups who talk about that.  But I will say this.  There's many young people out there who had a good stepfather who was a good role model.  Maybe the only good role model in their life.  And I had some people write me as a result of that and say, yeah, I had a good stepfather.  And he was amazing.  So here's to all the stepfathers.  Just yes.  It's all right.  Men are the carnies that operate the carousel.  Think about it.  A lot of men talk about women who rode the carousel.  I'm not saying the full phrase.  Some of you know what I'm talking about.  But think about it.  Who runs the carousel?  Men.  Men, have we contributed to the very thing that we loathe?  Have you gone out there banging everything, swiping left and right, and picking up girls?  Have you done that?  This is a responsibility channel.  You're not a victim of feminism and a victim of women.  If you are banging women all throughout your teens and 20s and then by the time you're 30 or 40, which is pretty lame.  You see like men 40 and over talk about this and have entire YouTube channels about this stuff.  That's pretty lame, isn't it?  And then you bitch and moan that there's no good women out there after you just spent the last 10, 20 years.  25 years.  Just ripping through them.  You contributed to the problem that you're now complaining about.  That's not virtuous.  Don't ever let me hear the fa.  King.  Word.  Virtuous come out of your mouth ever again.  That's what I call hypocrisy.  Look in the mirror, dude.  Yeah, red pill dude.  I have no problem with the red pill.  I'm a red pill guy.  I'm just not a dread pill guy.  You're confusing your pills.  If your pill makes you be an asshole, then guess what?  You took the wrong pill.  Happy Monday.  Marriage not only reveals your weaknesses, it magnifies them.  Your wife's job is not to heal you.  She can apply a balm of understanding, compassion, and make it a softer landing for you.  But you must heal yourself.  The best avenue is with a trusted brother or a friend who that you can be truthful with.  I'm not saying to lie to your wife or withhold truth.  I'm saying use wisdom in what you tell your wife.  All right.  Oh, I tell my wife everything.  That's your first problem.  Type in the word in Google, type in the word sexless and see what drops down.  You're going to see sexless marriage, sexless relationship, sexless marriage quiz, sexless marriage reasons, sexless marriage separate bedrooms, sexless marriage and affairs, sexless marriage effects on life, sexless marriage and divorce.  Just type in the word sexless in Google and watch what drops down.  Which, it's interesting.  When you look at some of the studies, one study says 2% of all marriages are sexless.  But Google search results tell you a different story.  Don't they?  There's a lot more men looking for help on sexless marriages than any study would ever reveal.  There's an epidemic of sexless marriages.  I actually just call them nutless men marriages.  Same thing.  Again, blame it on the wife, right?  She's the gatekeeper to the poo.  Say.  And you don't know what to do with it.  Because you just worshipped the poo.  Say.  And now you're in the other bedroom.  Or on the couch.  Good job.  Good job.  The words sexless and marriage should never be in the same sentence.  Ever.  Again, there's entire YouTube channels devoted to men getting their nuts back and trying to work their way back into their woman's poo.  Say, you did it before you were married.  You got that poo.  Say, and you were good at it.  Now you're wondering why you have a nutless, excuse me, a sexless marriage.  Hmm.  Shed life is pretty amazing.  The only thing that's missing in my shed would be a mini wood stove.  That would be awesome.  I have a cube heater, an electric cube heater, but I'll tell you what, having a little wood stove in there would be awesome.  That's going to be one of my next moves.  But I also think a lean-to with a fire pit in front of it is a nice thing for a backyard as well for all weather, outdoor, night fun.  fire up that fire pit and you're sitting there in your chair in your lean-to or sitting on the edge of it, that would be cool.  Do you want someone to be interested in you?  Well, then be interesting.  Or at least be more interesting than your perceived competition.  Just because you love somebody does not mean you have to marry them.  Somebody needed to hear that.  Somebody needed to hear that.  Just because you love somebody doesn't mean you have to marry them.  Okay, that'll be $250, please.  Thank you.  The smartest people in the world and some of the smartest people I know act so dumb and they put so much on the line just because they can't be alone.  Learn how to be alone and there's half your problems gone right there.  You're not real quick to fill the chair across the table or that side of the bed.  Learn how to be alone.  Learn how to be content and be alone.  Become a lay monastic.  Solitude, silence, and service isn't a bad thing, is it?  Compare that to heartbreak, divorce, breaking up, all of a sudden the monk life sounds pretty darn good, doesn't it?  What is the most vintage pipe tobacco that you currently have?  I have a blend from 1989 that I bought at a drugstore along with a Dr.  Grabo Duke pipe that I still have.  And when that is humidified.  It is amazing.  That would have been my original gateway drug back in the 80s.  Yeah, what's yours?  Christian Trump voters, will you not vote for Trump because he said the word fa-k a couple times on the Rush Limbaugh show?  Be consistent with your selective bull- It.  Theology.  The make-it-up-as-you-go-along theology.  Selective equals defective.  You don't like people who curse.  You condemn people that curse.  Say the F word.  But the president you're voting for tomorrow said the word F. Several times.  Live.  On the air.  but you're flipping a lever for him.  Interesting.  Selective equals defective.  Sex destroys a single woman, but it enriches a married woman.  Having sex as a single woman, ladies, has contributed to your demise and the lowering of your value.  Having sex as a married woman is going to enrich you and increase your value.  And with that, finish your coffee, and I'll see you tomorrow on The Daybreak Show, your home of sanity, clarity, and reason.  It's a good day.  Repeat after me.  It's a good day.  Now say it.  It's a good day.  Say it again.  It's a good day.  You are going to have a good day today.  Thank you.  Thank you. ",
