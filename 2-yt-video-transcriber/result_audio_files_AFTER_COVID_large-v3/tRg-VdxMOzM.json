The people who would be most affected by a $15 minimum wage increase is not the mom and pop shop down the road, which this kind of thinking has already forced out.  It's, of course, these multinational corporations, which are by far the greatest employers in the country and around the world.  And at a local restaurant, say the price of a steak or a pasta dish goes up a dollar, goes up 10 cents.  The people who are getting the $15 minimum wage, that helps them so much more than it hurts the person who is able to dine out to use these services.  And so that's the disingenuous argument that's being had there.  And yet, you know, there's never a discussion about how Productivity has increased so exponentially and the wage has remained flat for decades and decades.  The amount of productivity by American workers is dwarfing the money that they are receiving.  And so part of that is why multinational corporations have been able to create this stronghold in our country where they're able to create a system of essentially indentured servitude.  So people are forced to take those low wages.  It's this circular system that is never examined on those financial channels.  I watched a good amount of that in the pandemic, and it makes you want to rip your hair out.  It's a cult in many ways. ",
