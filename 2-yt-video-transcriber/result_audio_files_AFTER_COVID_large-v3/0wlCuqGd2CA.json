            "text": "hello everyone and welcome to a new sex toy review.  today's product is the bondage woman doggy style pussy stroker from best vibe and this is without a doubt the smallest sex doll ever But it's almost a full sextal.  It has legs, it has arms.  Now it doesn't have a skeleton.  So the reason why the arms and the legs are in this particular position is so that they're fused.  So while the feet are, you could like flick them like this, you can't pull the leg off of its position because it's all one piece.  It's designed to be this way so you don't have these floppy limbs flopping around doing floppy things.  But it does have, it has arms.  It has legs.  It has feet.  It has boobs.  It has the whole body.  It cuts off, strangely, at the shoulder.  I mean, at that point, why not just add a head?  I don't know.  You could probably take, like, I don't know, like a smart doll head.  For those of you who have smart dolls... This might be the perfect sex doll for you because you could just take a smart doll head and kind of just stick it in there using, I don't know, whatever.  And then now you have a fuckable sex doll that's the size of like one of those smart dolls.  If you don't know what a smart doll is, it's a very expensive anime style.  I mean, calling them Barbie dolls is a little bit disingenuous, but... They're ball joint dolls.  They're very collectible, very expensive.  There's a whole community of people who the ball joint smart dolls are their waifu.  But the problem with these ball joint smart dolls is that they're small.  They're like the size of Barbie dolls.  They're a little bit bigger perhaps.  But they're definitely not life size.  So you want to put your penis in them.  It's a little difficult.  A little difficult because they're hard plastic and they clearly can't accommodate even the smallest of men.  I mean, I don't care what kind of a micropenis you have.  You're not going to fit it in something this size.  Now, this is more like a pocket pussy that has a doll body molded around it.  But again, this is very similar to the other thing I reviewed where it integrates into an anime body pillow.  This would integrate well with a ball joint doll or a smart doll or anything like that.  so if you are a collector if your waifu is a smart doll or a ball joint doll this might be the sex doll for you because you can integrate your waifu's.  you know doll head onto this somehow and then you can actually have sex with your waifu.  uh despite the the size differences if you have like a i don't know what you call that anyway.  So don't be too thrown off by the ropes.  It's just part of the design.  It's there so that the arms and the legs don't get away and go crazy.  So it's all fused together.  Nothing moves.  But everything feels real.  Like, look, the boobs are squishy.  You can do this.  It has whatever.  One thing to note, the butthole, as you can see, the butthole is just a small dip.  There's no actual channel.  So anal is impossible.  You could probably take a tool, maybe like a knife or a letter opener, and poke a hole in the butthole to basically join the vagina channel.  Poke a hole in here until you hit the vagina channel, and then you could basically enter that channel two different ways, but then you might tear it, most likely.  You'll probably tear this open, so you may not want to do that.  But if anal is super important to you, it is your toy.  You can do whatever you want to, but you can modify it.  Anyway, so because this is a full doll, you can do a surprising amount of positions with it.  Obviously, you can lay it on its back or hold it in your hand.  You know, she's all tied up.  You can just use her like a regular pocket pussy, as so.  And then that would be more like a missionary position.  So you can have missionary pocket pussy sex.  You can flip her over and you can have, you know, doggy style sex.  You can lay on your back and just, you know, have some girl on top.  I mean, any position... that a girl could realistically do, you could basically do with this.  Again, this is an actual sex doll.  It just, the arms and the legs don't move and it's very, very small.  As far as the channel, maybe you're concerned like, well, how deep is the pussy?  Here is a six and a half inch drying rod.  I'm going to stick this in the hole and push this all the way up.  All right.  So you can see it right here.  See the bump?  That is the... Oh, maybe you can't see it.  The light... Okay.  See that?  That bump is from the drying rod.  So it goes all the way up.  Like Vlad the Impaler style.  So if you ever wanted to have Vlad the Impaler style sex, here you go.  So your penis goes all the way through the body.  Do not pass go.  So you're like going all the way through her sternum.  You're hitting it all.  But anyway, that's kind of what you'd have to do to use this as a sex toy for a life-size human.  Because obviously you can't shrink yourself down.  So yeah, it has a life-size vagina cavity.  But the doll is shrunk down.  Obviously, the upside, the pro, what I liked about this toy is that it did kind of have the look and the feel of a full-size sex doll for obviously a fraction of the price.  So that's a cool novelty.  And when you're holding it, even though she's really small, it does, you know, you can feel her curves, you can feel her body.  And again, this would be perfect for someone with a ball joint or a smart doll waifu.  The hardest part about this toy, the one downside about this toy, and it's not a small downside, is clean up.  Clean up is a motherfucker.  See, with most pocket pussies, they're cylindrical.  So you can take them to the bathroom, turn them inside out, rinse out the inside, wash your cum out, dry it, then turn it back, you know, the outside out you know back to the normal way and then you're good to go.  you can put it back wherever you got it and wait till next time because this toy is a human shaped.  you know you cannot turn this inside out.  it's literally impossible.  you just rip it apart if you try to turn this inside out.  so the only way to clean it unfortunately is you have to, uh, like, basically put your fingers in here, stretch it out, and as you can see, the texture, it's very reminiscent of a lot of, uh, pocket pussies.  It's not necessarily a realistic texture, but that's okay.  It feels good.  Um, but the only way to clean this out, unfortunately, is you're gonna have to, like, open it up, and then basically, you know, pour water in it and dump it out like a cup.  Anyway, so you stretch it out, fill it up with water, dump it out.  You may wanna take like a flushable wipe just to dig out anything that wasn't caught by rinsing it out.  So rinse this out with water, dump it out like a cup, take a flushable wipe, reach in there and try to clean everything out.  After that, once the wipe comes out and it doesn't smell like sex, it's basically clean.  Then you can take a drying rod like this and stick it in there.  Alright, and once you do that, she's good to go.  She's got the drying rod running all the way through her, soaking up any residual moisture.  You can just put this somewhere until you need it next time.  So, a pretty straightforward doll.  It definitely is, you know, now here's the thing, one thing I will caution.  Some people might be tempted to buy something like this as their starter doll to see if a doll is right for them.  And so they'll get this and this will be like weird because it's so small and they might be like, oh, well, it's too weird.  You know, this doesn't feel like the real thing.  So I need to emphasize that while this is a sex doll, it's missing only the head.  So it's almost a full doll.  It's definitely not a full size doll.  You're definitely not getting the full size doll experience if you buy a doll like this.  I'm over it.  I mean, I've had, you know, the Hobbit torsos and whatever.  I'm kind of used to these types of toys.  But if this is your first doll, I wouldn't go for this unless you have a smart doll or a ball joint doll waifu already.  Then this might be the toy for you.  But if you don't have a ball joint doll, if you don't have a smart doll waifu, and you want to try out a full-size doll, but you want to know if it's right for you.  so you don't want to spend too much money, I understand that.  Like, wanting to try before you buy.  Like, before you drop two grand on a full-size doll, you want to buy something a little bit cheaper to make sure you like it.  Don't get this for that.  Because this is too different because of the size differences.  You're not getting the actual doll experience with something like this.  This is a very specific product for people with ball joint and smart doll waifus.  If you're going to get a toy in order to know if sex dolls are right for you, I'd literally just get a basic pocket pussy or fleshlight.  The main reason why people decide a doll isn't right for them is because the thought of masturbating with something other than a real woman or their hand just is weird because it's different.  And so it's like a mental hang-up.  So you don't need to spend crazy amounts of money on stuff like this.  You can just get a regular pocket pussy.  If you don't have a mental hang-up masturbating with a toy, you should be fine with a doll.  Alright, so the product is a little bit expensive for what it is, for the size of it, but it's a novelty, I guess.  So it's $34.  Now because this is fairly cheap as far as Best Vibes products go, I couldn't get a 20% off coupon code, so I got a 12% off coupon code.  So if you use the coupon code, it lowers it significantly to about $30.  So for $30, this may be right for you, especially, again, if you have a ball joint or smart doll waifu.  This might be exactly what you're looking for and have been looking for for a long time.  So if you're into that, if this sounds like something you'd be interested in, if you have a ball joint or smart doll waifu, check this out.  12% off coupon code.  Get it while it's hot.  If not, maybe it's the product for you.  Maybe you want to check it out.  Maybe you don't.  But that's up to you.  So anyway, that is the product.  So thank you, Best5, for sponsoring this video.  Again, 12% off coupon code.  Check out the website.  This is Turd Flinging Monkey.  Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time. ",
