            "text": "Shalom.  To the scattered elect that are scattered around the four corners of the earth that be like unto the speckled bird, the Israelite foreigners, and to the Akwath that are listening and learning to you, I say shalom.  This is your brother Malcoma.  From the branch of the great millstone here in Chicago coming at you with another lesson in truth.  All right.  And, um, we're going to be profiling this video here, not the video itself.  Um, it was, this was called Kayla to eat for my humble self before the Lord.  And, um, we're going to address some of the comments on the comment board toward the, uh, taking a while for it to load up.  So lock you, but, uh, Don't really want to hear the sound.  So let's kill that sound.  There we go.  And we're just going to go to the comments.  So it takes a moment for them to load up.  So while they're doing that, I'm going to grab a couple quick scriptures.  And the first scripture is Proverbs 1 In 22.  And it reads.  How long ye simple ones.  Will ye love simplicity.  And scorners delight in their scorning.  And fools hate knowledge.  Now there are a lot of really.  Good comments on.  You know.  A lot of scriptures.  A lot of edification.  A lot of.  Repentful people.  A lot of.  There's women on this comment board.  Who are sincere.  All right.  Or appearing to be sincere.  All right.  But then you got.  You know, let's go.  Well, they're still loading up because the very last comment has 49 responses to it.  Now, I don't know, you know, because I'm going to name this.  This video is going to be labeled A.I.  says artificial intelligence agents.  And two third niggas.  Because.  This video became an all out assault.  Well, this, this, the comment board became an all out assault by this deep freezer asshole right here.  Okay.  I haven't even clicked on the channel.  As a matter of fact, let's click on it.  I'm willing to bet it's going to say, ah, four subscribers.  Okay.  Videos.  Let's see.  Nope.  No works.  Playlist.  probably no playlist, no channel, no discussion.  So, so we know that this is a person now.  All right.  So let's go back.  Hopefully it goes back to the comments.  All right.  Well, let me grab another scripture because.  The things that this this this deep freedom person said about our beloved apostle is beyond offensive.  And it angled a lot and a lot of brothers were attacking this individual who just spewing out conjecture lies and bearing false witness.  And they don't understand.  it's going to be a grievous payment for doing such a thing.  This is a. This is the book of Exodus 20 and 16.  And it reads, thou should not bear false witness against thy neighbor.  All right.  Now, from the way this person is talking, you know, it almost seems like they're in one of those bootleg Israelite camps.  Okay.  Well, so here you go.  49 replies.  so there was a lot of back and forth going with this.  uh with with you know with this guy.  so it says uh so here we go first first one it says out of nowhere.  then he just says gabar acts like he hates women.  i've never seen him with one either.  so well have you ever seen me with the woman?  So what are you trying to say?  You, you don't, you don't, you, have you ever seen any of the men of the Lord with that woman?  So that almost makes me think too, that this might be a person who goes back.  Okay.  So that kind of cuts out the AI.  All right.  Although don't get it twisted.  They use AIs, they use algorithms, you know, to, to, to try and sow dissent and get people to to look away.  In my videos, they're always posting up these little sexy women videos, and it's always got a bunch of big-breasted Asian women, you know, saying I'm lonely or call me, and I click on it and go to this endless channel, because I always block and remove them.  When I click on it to see it, it's literally hundreds and hundreds of, so that's an AI that's set up to do that.  So AIs exist, all right, and they try to come against this truth.  And, you know, and, you know, and men be on the comic board and they trying to be spiritual.  And all of a sudden they see some cheats and some breasts and they click off.  And then, you know, next thing you know, they clicking on breasts and booty videos and they, their mind is gone.  All right.  They're not focused, but nevertheless, it says the bar acts like he hates women.  I never seen him with one either.  And then, um, GMS get this work replied.  Why would you see him with the woman?  Isn't his job as well as his as well as a hopeful elect to prophesy?  Great question.  Isn't that supposed to be the job of the men of the Lord?  All right.  So what he's going to do, shoot videos of him hanging out with his woman and upload them to his page.  All right.  And then I responded.  Apostle Gabor hates wicked women, as should you.  I guess adulterous twerking sisters get a pass according to you.  All right.  And then he asks us at me, there's no free will that can't help.  It's part of, of, of T8, Timmy TMA smokes high plane.  I guess he meant plan.  Am I right?  Have you seen a bar with women?  I bet you delete this or no.  comment is simple.  Yes or no.  So, you know, that question and that comment has nothing to do with this video.  This video was about a sister repenting, begging for forgiveness and seeking on how to now please the Lord and coming into the knowledge of who she is.  All right.  That's what this video was about.  It wasn't even about the Apostle Kabbalah.  You know, this is a guy just trying to soak contention.  And then, you know, I'm not even going to read all of these.  But as you start going down, then you start talking about him.  You know, he starts saying things about pedophilia or being with underage girls before they bleed, which is all a lie.  You know, if the men of Great Millstone were teaching and doing that, why are we not locked up?  As a matter of fact, some of the camps that are accused of such things actually got caught up in those sort of things.  Which brings this scripture to mind.  This is Proverbs.  Actually, I'm gonna go to Luke.  Let me go to Luke.  Let's go to the New Testament.  20 and, I'm sorry, 17 and two.  And it reads, it will be better For him that a millstone be hanged around his neck and spiritually a millstone is hanged around your neck.  That's why y'all hate the great millstone.  All right, because we constantly grinding in this truth and getting on your wickedness and people don't like it when their wickedness gets pointed out.  They like to twist it and try to throw it back on you.  That's what they do.  I've learned that the guilty try to deflect from themselves and point out any flaws that you may have or what you did to out to to get around what they did.  All right.  But it says.  As a matter of fact, I'm a start of verse one.  Luke 17 and one.  Then said he unto the disciples, it is impossible.  But that offenses will come, but woe unto him through whom they come.  See, woe unto you when you bring the offenses to the men of the Lord, right?  Because they must come, but woe if you be the vessel that bring them, right?  It was better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and he is cast into a sea that he should offend one of these little ones.  So I want you to imagine a millstone, which was probably a couple hundred, a couple tons at least.  All right.  You know, now I'm sure they came in various sizes, but you imagine one that's two tons, like a two-ton truck.  Imagine a two-ton truck that's tied to you and chained to you around your neck, and then they drive that truck off into a deep sea.  So that's a pretty horrific death.  And he's saying that that would be better than to offend one of the little ones.  Hey, you people better get your... Oh, man.  All right.  Let's go to the book of Mark now.  Because Mark said something very similar.  All right.  From his witness of the comment that Yahushua made.  All right.  This is Mark 9 and 42.  And it reads... And whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me, it is better for him that a millstone will hang about his neck and he will cast into the sea.  All right.  You people keep playing around, man.  All right.  You just keep playing around.  Yeah.  And as you see, I'm just going to scroll down.  Look, it even says show more replaced more than that.  It just keeps going.  It just it just keeps going.  All right.  And not loading up for some reason.  But nevertheless, this deep freezer guy.  There it is.  It's starting to load up now.  All these spoke facts, nothing fabricated.  You see nothing wrong with the straight man, nor being nor being seen with the woman in 20 years.  And also so you've known him for 20 years and you've been around the apostle, the apostle for 20 years.  That you were able to record.  So instead of you.  I looked at your channel.  And there's nothing on your channel.  So instead of you feeding the sheep.  You spend your days driving around.  Following the apostle.  So when he goes to a spot to do a walking talk.  When he goes to a spot.  You know.  To do a lesson in a park.  In a forest.  Or whatever.  You in the background with some binoculars taking notes.  Clown ass.  Boy I'm telling you man.  I'm going to tell you, man, I'm greatly offended because I got I got a love and an affection for the apostles, man.  And they ain't no, no, no, no gay shit either, man.  All right.  I've been around these men.  I broke bread with these men.  I stayed.  I stayed.  I stayed at the Apostle Gabor Apostle Ram Lab's house, man.  And that's some of the most humble men that you could ever meet, man.  Beautiful beautiful in the spirit man, and and and every time I was around them I got better and got stronger in the spirit man.  Because they they they they reinforce that order Starting with them and and the head and the head elders that come up under them man.  These men and I'm talking about elder I knop and elder to Zawan and elder elder not desire You know And anyone that an elder I buy, you know, I mean, it's just for you people to say some of the things that you say about these men who truly trying to, who did this for years before the YouTube thing.  They were out there for decades pushing this truth, man, with no fruit, man, being scoffed and mocked.  But they kept going.  And then you got people that were to complain about waiting a year or two for something, a couple years for something.  When these men pushed and pushed for decades before they saw the influx of the men of the Lord come in and start doing the work, man, seeing the prophecies be fulfilled.  And while all that's going on, this deep freezer nigga is following the apostle around taking notes.  Man, you a liar.  And the Lord is going to deal with you and people like you, man.  All right, let me grab another scripture.  This is Deuteronomy 5 and 20.  And it's a law.  Neither shall thou bear false witness against thy neighbor.  Because there's stuff in there.  I don't even want to utter, man.  He's accusing the apostle of being, you know, a homosexual and he's never with a woman.  So first, then he was with an underage woman.  So which one is it?  I'm going to grab one more scripture, man, because this dude, you know, I'm just mad as hell right now just reading this garbage.  But this is Deuteronomy, the 19th chapter, verses 16 through 19.  So this is for you, my man, Deep Freezer, because you will receive that death by pain and you will be shamefaced in the kingdom for doing what you've done.  All right.  This is Deuteronomy 19 to 16.  If a false witness rise up against any man to testify against him, that which is wrong, which you have done, because this is nothing but your stupid opinion and conjecture, like most of the people that come in on the comment board.  They come on with their opinions and their conjecture, and opinions are like assholes.  Everybody's got one.  All right?  You're a nasty one that's been unwiped.  You're an unclean asshole.  Moist booty ass.  This is Deuteronomy 19 and 16.  If a false witness rise up against any man to testify against him, if a false witness rise up against any man to testify against him, that which is wrong.  Then both the men between whom the controversy is shall stand before Yahuwah, before the priests and the judges, which shall be in those days.  And I pray that you get to see Apostle Kabar get raised up into the cherries while your ass is left down here.  I pray that you get to witness it, that you get to see it.  All right.  And verse 18, and the judges shall make diligent inquisition.  and behold, if the witness be a false witness and has testified falsely against his brother, then shall ye do unto him as he had thought to have done unto his brother.  So shall thou put evil away from among you.  All right.  And there it is, man.  Qal hulayi hawa ba'shem avashayi ba'shem rakak v'dash.  Wa'aba ba'bal.  Shalawam.  Qam yasir ala. ",
