            "text": "joe biden is the gift that just keeps giving.  i kind of don't want the election to end because i want to keep joe biden in the discussion.  thankfully i don't think it's going to end.  not thankfully because it's stupid.  that's that's the case.  but it's probably not going to be over on november 3rd.  it's not going to be a traditional election year so we'll get a little bit but i think we're going to win.  so don't worry i think we're going to win but we're going to get a little bit more of biden and cam cam because it's going to get drug out And it's, again, very stupid that it is.  But Biden, he's the gift that keeps on giving, and he gets angry.  I talk about it all the time.  This is one of the reasons I can't wait for the debate, all of the debates, assuming he can show up and he doesn't get COVID beforehand.  He not only stumbles over everything he says, but he gets angry.  He picks fights.  We've seen it, you know, his whole AR-14 comment, which is laughable in the first place.  But we've seen him pick fights with just normal citizens, right?  Not very presidential.  Not very classy.  Not any of those things.  But he does it.  The Scranton and Joe comes out.  As he would call it.  I have no problem with people from Scranton.  I think it's a great town.  Gave us a great show in the office.  But I don't love Joe.  But he got angry.  with a reporter for asking very fairly a question about his son, Hunter Biden, during a Q&A session here.  And he got angry, and we're gonna see more of this Tuesday, but this was the scene.  rule two.  How is your role as vice president in charge of policy in Ukraine and your son's job in Ukraine, how is that not a conflict of interest? ",

            "text": "Focus on this man.  So he gets angry.  And again, that's a fair question.  And there is information on Hunter Biden.  You just want to say that there's not, hoping that your followers and your minions will believe it because you're lying outright and that the mainstream media will protect you, which they will.  They'll do it.  They'll do that for you, Joe.  I don't think they really believe in you, but they'll do it because they don't like Trump.  But there's a new 87-page report that also, you know, there's tons of info on Ukraine, China, I mean, Hunter Biden's made a lot of money for doing nothing other than cocaine.  He's really good at doing that.  But he's made a lot of money for doing nothing.  There's a new report that he received $3.5 million from Elena Baturina, richest woman in Russia.  So just bring that up as an example.  We've heard all the Ukraine stuff, the Burisma stuff.  We've heard the China stuff.  We've now heard this.  And there's plenty there.  But the Democrats tactic is always just lie and then throw something else out there to talk about, which is exactly what he does here.  He gets mad.  There's no there's no information on that, which is a lie.  Talk about this man, this man.  Like all you can do is blame Trump for stuff.  All you can do is be.  I get it.  It's a campaign season.  It's election season.  That's what people do.  is they throw mud.  But you've got nothing.  At least people in the past had some charisma.  Obama, as bad of a president as he was, lots of charisma, lots of energy, articulate.  You could see why people listened to him and bought whatever he said, hook, line, and sinker.  You don't have that, Joe.  You don't have that at all.  So you lie, and then you distract.  That's what you do.  Lie and distract.  It's the Democrat way.  But then, this was funny too.  I thought it was funny.  Speaking of taking jabs at Trump, he was having a black summit of some variety.  It'll say it on the sign in the background of where he is.  But he's having this black summit and then after he does his speech and he just works his way through it with his note cards and attacks Trump, he takes some Q&A.  He tried to take a jab at Trump here.  Roll three. ",
