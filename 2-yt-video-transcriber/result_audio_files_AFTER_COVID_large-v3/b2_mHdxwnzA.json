This is the most beautiful place in the world, Central Park.  Every day I come here, I'm amazed at how beautiful it is.  I'm in a New York state of mind.  We lived in a rent-controlled apartment by the park.  Know what my mother did to get that apartment?  She smothered her sister with a pillow.  She killed her sister for this city.  Yeah!  Well, it hasn't been your day, your week, your month, or even your year, but I'll be there for you.  Before COVID, I had a great fucking job.  I used to spit on people at Central Park and they'd give me money.  You can't get a job like that somewhere else.  This is the greatest city.  There's opportunities everywhere.  Jerry Seinfeld thinks we're going to make it and I bet he's right.  It's the greatest city in the world, baby. ",
