But I know my secret is safe with you.  I've mentioned in giving my testimony, sharing my testimony and so on, that when you grow up as a psychopath, you kind of spend the first part of your life learning to blend in, learning to do what other people are doing, imitating other people.  But then you reach a certain age in your teens where you're thinking, why am I imitating these people, right?  You become a kind of like narcissist and thinking, why am I living by the same rules?  Why am I making myself live by the same rules that everyone else is living by?  And then you end up doing horrible, messed up things.  because you start thinking to yourself, well, you know, I'm not supposed to kill.  Why?  Because this person said it.  Why should I listen to this person?  And so on.  And so you end up feeling like you've been polluted or corrupted by other people.  And you start trying to strip all of that stuff away to get to the real you, the true you that has been uncorrupted by the rest of the world.  So basically- Yeah.  So you have the first part of your life and that's learning to blend in.  And then you have the next part of your life, which is breaking free from all of that.  Then I became a Christian.  Then I became a Christian.  And... Then as a Christian, I actually believe in a moral standard.  I believe that Jesus is Lord.  I believe that we have to, you know, strive to imitate Christ and so on.  But you also start kind of doing things that you just see other Christians doing.  You know what I mean?  You're not getting them from Jesus.  You're not getting them from the Bible.  You're just sort of picking up as you go along how a Christian apologist, let's say, is supposed to do things.  Well, what do you do?  You look to the Christian apologist that you like.  You look to the Christian apologist that you like and say, hey, I want to do things the way this Christian apologist does.  And so after becoming a Christian and then deciding to be a Christian apologist, you spend time.  your time sort of imitating other people and so on.  But then once again, you get to a point where you're thinking to yourself, this isn't really me.  It's kind of not the real me.  Yes, I still believe Jesus is Lord.  Yes, I have to imitate Christ.  But there's all this other stuff that I kind of picked up along the way that I'm living by that I didn't get from Christ.  I didn't get it from the Bible.  It's just this is how Christians do things.  And so now I'm kind of at the point in life where why am I doing that?  It's not the real me.  We have to get down to the real core.  And at my core... ",
