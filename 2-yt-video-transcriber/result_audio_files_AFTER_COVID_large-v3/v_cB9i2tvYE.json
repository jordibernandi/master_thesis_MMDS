My name's Chris Thrall, I'm a former Royal Marines Commando and I fought my way back from chronic trauma and addiction to live, work and travel in 80 countries across all seven continents, achieving all of my dreams and goals along the way.  Now I pass my simple system on to other people, but I can only help you if you like and subscribe.  So please do so because you get one life, and if you live it right, one is enough.  Thank you. ",
