            "text": "Hello, my friends.  My name is Justice Knight.  Today, filling in for Lisa Haven unexpectedly.  We had a series of events occur yesterday that landed her into emergency surgery.  So I'm going to ask for your patience while I work through this broadcast because we had to, unfortunately, even though I was blessed to have made it there just in the nick of time to have an ailing and injured Lisa have to walk out so we can have a moment together before she went into surgery.  And when I say walk out, I mean walk out of the emergency room physically, because that is the only way you're allowed to see a loved one.  But I'm going to continue that rant over on Restricted Republic, because if I do it here right now under my emotional state, I promise you I'd get her in a lot of trouble.  And I'm not going to do that, but I do invite you over there to watch that broadcast.  I'll give you the details in a moment.  But before and as I work through this, please be patient.  This is information we both wanted to present to you.  It's about Operation Legend and the federal charges that came down today and how this ties into money, money, money, the root of all evil.  Well, once again, There's a very close correlation between the cities involved in Operation Legend and money or lack thereof.  And we're going to get there as quickly as we can.  I'm running through some notes and also on my lap is my phone because at any moment I'm hoping to get an update on how her surgery is going.  So we may break.  You may hear it live.  It just depends on what breaks here.  One of her sponsors and one of the texts she had to send me because I can't see her face to face, obviously, was an amazing sponsor that you want to make sure I did not forget about, agewithlisa.com.

But now going back to the 1,000 arrests, including suspects and 90 murders, or going back to the 1,500 arrests, because mainstream media can't get anything right.  They never can get anything right.  Why should we be surprised?  And it's why we tell you don't go to mainstream media.  Well, most people would be happy about Operation Legend.  Well, except those cities... involved with the money that we're gonna wrap together very quickly here.  Portland official, as city burns, there is a violent and tragic history of oppression in our country.  No, the tragedy is the fact of how you run your city, what you're allowing happen to its residents.  And the fact that you're trying to point the finger of blame in a different direction, that is the tragedy.  But there's a deeper saga here.  You see, it's an underlying problem.  Iowa State professor threatens to dismiss students who oppose abortion or BLM.  You see, everything's all mixed up nowadays.  It's confusing.  It's a purposeful misdirection to keep you confused.  But it's why you're here.  It's why hopefully you go to my channel.  It's why you're at Restricted Republic because we can uncover this and uncover it in very simple terms.  So today we'll handle the math, the financial side of things.  Truth in Accounting, 2020 Financial State of the Cities.  very interesting publication.  it's a long publication 188 pages that we're not going to put you through today.  we're going to take the highlights 63 cities do not have enough money to pay their bills.  323.2 billion in unfunded debt.  well those numbers start to twist into this The protests, the riots, and even COVID-19 in a weird way.  And we'll get there.  And there's your 75 city ranking chart.  At the very bottom is the worst ranking.  Those with the biggest taxpayer burden of New York, Chicago, New Orleans, Philadelphia, Portland, shocker, Nashville, San Francisco, Baltimore, Cincinnati, Milwaukee, St.  Louis.  I want you to remember some of these names.  This is the bottom of the list.  Kansas City, because those names are going to carry forward into our broadcast.  Of those, 63 of America's largest 75 cities are completely broke.  Well, Justice, what does that have to do with the story and the rioting of Portland that you showed?  Well, it has a lot to do with the story.  It has a lot to do with Operation Legend.  Federal charges by the numbers.  We're mere pawns in this game, mayors worry.  Trump's Operation Legend is more about politics than law enforcement.  Well, is it?  Some argue that many of the cities are swing states.  And Trump's trying to make a stand.  Well, if we didn't have the riots and the looting and the destruction of property and the residents within those states feeling insecure based on what's happening with the defund the police movement, then there will be no need for a federal response.  Because if you know what I stand for, I stand for state rights.  And federal shouldn't be intruding in the states except for when the state fails to provide for its citizens in the level of safety and protection and economic stability.  all of which many of the cities within Operation Legend are having issues with.  Let's start with Kansas City, Missouri.  20 defendants have been charged, and I'm not gonna go into the filings because that's not the critical part, but we're gonna stay on Kansas City, Missouri.  We're gonna go to DataZ.  and how is their financial health in Kansas City.  They have a D rating, and I'm gonna go full screen so you can look at this a little bit closer and how this operates.  Kansas City has $1.5 billion available to pay for $3 billion in debt.  Well, those numbers don't work out very well, do it, but does it?  But Kansas City Mayor says he learned on Twitter that federal officers were in his city.  What's the matter, Mayor?  Do you not want the federal officers there?  Do you want the looting and rioting and protesting to continue?  Well, that seems a little bit counterintuitive, doesn't it?  Or is there something larger at foot?  Kansas City receives $18 million from Jackson County in CARES Act funding, the mayor says.  Hmm.  A redistribution of wealth.  You see, you're going to learn about each one of these cities in Operation Legend.  Democratic strongholds.  Democrat strongholds, not democratic.  I got to stop.  It's a word we're trying to twist away from.  They want to keep using the word democratic.  They're Democrats.  There's nothing democratic about it.  Chicago, 34 defendants charged with firearm related offenses.  Well, that's funny because it wasn't Mayor Lightfoot before she backtracked. ",
