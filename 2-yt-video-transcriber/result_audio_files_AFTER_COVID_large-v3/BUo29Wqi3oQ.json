Strickland, the indicted and suspended sheriff of Colleton County, South Carolina.  You may recall that Strickland is a friend and protector of the Broxton Bridge Plantation, also located in Colleton County.  Broxton Bridge Plantation holds cruel, wasteful live pigeon shoots for psychopaths who can't be bothered with real hunting and hunting ethics, such as fair chase and eating what you kill.  These sick people involved children in their massacres, and Sheriff Strickland, when provided with overwhelming evidence of abuse to both animals and children at the hands of the psychos, chose to stand with the psychos.  In fact, Strickland is on a first-name basis with Broxton owner Jerry Barn, who calls him Andy.  I thought Andy told me he differed, that that was something that he could make him move for.

He was only going there to pursue an extramarital affair with the subordinate.  While there, Strickland gave the young employee, who was under 21, alcohol and Ambien.  Ambien is a prescription sedative that is illegal to use without a doctor's okay, and it is not to be used with alcohol.  Charges also include giving a $3,000 government radio with secure first responder communications channels to a citizen with no valid official purpose.  The damning information just goes on and on, and we'll include a number of links in the description section of this video.  Shark regularly calls out people involved in animal cruelty, whether directly or by way of protecting those who are committing the abuse.  Those who abuse animals or corruptly protect those who abuse animals will tend to also abuse people, as Strickland did, and to commit other corrupt acts.  R.A.  Strickland, Andy, is just our latest example.  We'll continue to watch Andy Strickland's case and keep you informed.  I'm Steve Hindy for Showing Animals Respect and Kindness. ",
