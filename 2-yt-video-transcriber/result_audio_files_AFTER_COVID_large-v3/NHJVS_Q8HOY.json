            "text": "Hi, welcome to my review of Clash of the Titans, the original one from the 1981 I believe it is.  It'll be in the title of the video if I got that wrong.  Which is a classic movie, you know, there's the movie poster there and it's got Perseus and it's got Medusa there.  Oh, do you know what, actually that reminds me of something, the Medusa, just while I'm on that.  There's this article I've seen the other day and This is grey.  Feminists pour scorn over skinny and pubeless Medusa statue that pays homage to the Me Too movement outside court where Weinstein was sentenced because it was created by male artists.  A statue of Medusa recently unveiled in a Manhattan park and intended as a homage to the Me Too movement has drawn criticism from feminist groups.  This is great because it's a perfect example of no matter what you do, you cannot make these people happy, right?  It doesn't matter what you do.  the statue of the Greek mythological figure clutching a severed head was unveiled Tuesday in Collect Pond Park which is purposefully located across the street from the courthouse where Harvey Weinstein was convicted or railroaded as I would call it because he didn't do anything wrong anyway while some have praised the work as a powerful image for the Me Too movement.  it has drawn criticism from others who questioned why the work was done by a male sculptor.  Good God, man.  It's... It's just... I mean, it looks... It's kind of shit, really.  I mean, statue-wise, you know, it's kind of shit.  It's like... It looks like just a big blob of clay, you know?  Okay, technically, that's kind of what it is.  But, you know, I mean, there's no even, like, painted or anything.  It's rubbish.  I don't like it.  I think it just looks garbage.  But, anyway, that's just my artistic impression, you know?  I'm an art critic now.  The statue was the work of Argentine-Italian artist Luciano Garbati and was intended as a feminist response to Benvenuti Cellini's original work from the 16th century, Perseus with the Head of Medusa.  You see, he's turned that around because he's like a fucking total genius and nobody's ever thought of doing something like that before in the art world.  So he's basically copied a piece of art from the 16th century and twisted it around in order to say, look at me, I'm a feminist ally, I'm one of the good guys, which screams rapist to me, but that's usually the case.  In Greek mythology, Medusa was raped by... I mean... Before we go any further, let's go to the Met Museum, okay?  And this is what they say about Medusa.  The snake-haired Medusa does not become widespread until the 1st century BC.  The Roman author Ovid describes the mortal Medusa as a beautiful maiden seduced by Poseidon in the temple of Athena.  Such a sacrilege attracted the goddess's wrath and she punished Medusa by turning her hair to snakes.  You see the difference there?  Seduced.  Feminist terms.  raped.  He was raped.  Ah, okay, Medusa was raped, okay.  Medusa was seduced, but in feminist language that means raped, because although it's in mythology, they didn't actually find a written consent form from her, so it must have been rape.  And I believe that she had a glass of wine or more.  It was Greece, right?  And So she probably wasn't able to consent.  You know, she was like a grown adult woman.  So it's definitely rape.  It was sex.  Therefore, it's absolutely definitely rape because a feminist has written this.  Anyway, Medusa was raped by the powerful god Poseidon, but instead of Poseidon being punished, Medusa was blamed for defiling goddess Athena's sanctuary, which she did, and turned into a monstrous beast with snakes for hair, as well as a gaze that could turn men into stone.  The Greek hero and slayer of monsters, Perseus, was then sent to behead Medusa.  Yes.  Here's some tweets here from feminists or whatever.  If this is supposed to be so empowering for women, why is Medusa so skinny and pubeless?  What a thing to focus on though.  Here's an idea.  Say, why don't you make your own statue then?  I mean, if you want pubes on it and you want it to be fat.  Why don't you make your own?  Why don't you copy someone else's work?  Give it a little twist what this guy's done and then add a few pounds and, you know, some hair.  Freaks, man.  How is pubes empowering for women?  When did this become a thing?  Is this a thing?  Because I don't know about this.  Is this actually a thing?  How is not being skinny... They mean healthy, by the way.  How is not being skinny empowering for women?  Does that mean every fat woman is empowered?  Especially if she's got pubes?  It just doesn't make any sense.  I don't know how they make this connection.  This seems more like some man's fantasy than a statement, a commentary on sexual assault.  Yes, well, technically it is a man's fantasy because it was a man that made it, right?  But wouldn't it also be a lesbian's fantasy?  Do you think lesbians like fat women with pubes?  Is that what you think?  Pretty sure most people are just going to be confused about why there's a naked woman statue out in the public area.  And those who do know the story are going to be annoyed that it's been screwed up.  By the way, Perseus was innocent in this.  Poseidon is the guy who messed up Medusa.  You see, Perseus is just the guy that they hire.  He's like Rent-A-Kill, you know?  You've got an infestation.  Call that Perseus guy.  He knows how to deal with these fucking snake-haired fucking bints.  Get him in, you know?  he's just doing his fucking job, you know, he didn't go out, right, I'm gonna fucking, I'm gonna hunt down a woman that's been raped apparently, you know, and chop her head off, that's not what happened, is it?  Yes, Medusa was wronged by the gods of Greek mythology, much alike the many women who have suffered from sexual harassment or rape in the hands of Weinstein.  Well, did they suffer from sexual harassment or rape in the hands of Weinstein?  See, I don't call it suffering, right?  I have a cake here.  If you have sex with me, I will give you this cake.  If you then have sex with me and I give you this cake, and not only give you the cake, but you then go on to win awards for eating that cake, I don't think it's fair to say that I raped you.  You know, you could have just said no.  Every one of Weinstein's victims could have said no.  But they didn't say no.  And we have to treat them like toddlers because they're women.  You know, how is it rape?  How is it sexual harassment?  Ugh.  It's a powerful image for the Me Too movement.  Of course it is.  Everything is.  Remember that one of the girls standing in front of the... Standing like a little bossy little cunt in front of the bull in New York as well.  Has it been New York?  And that was a powerful Me Too image or some shit as well.  It's always... This is why nobody takes women seriously.  You can't just have a bit of art.  There's got to be some bullshit behind it that labels all men as rapists.  The original statue in Florence, Italy shows Perseus holding up the severed head of the Gorgon Medusa.  Mr.  Gabbati decided to reverse the narrative because he's a fucking genius.  That's how he's able to come up with his own stuff.  Instead showing an indomitable Medusa clutching a severed head of Perseus.  In his application for the statue, Mr.  Gabbati said the original work by Cellini had communicated to women for millennia that if they are raped, it is their fault.  You spelt seduced wrong.  But no, it didn't.  It's mythology.  What the fuck?  Do you know these people didn't actually exist?  It's a fucking statue.  It's basically a fairy tale.  A statue of a fairy tale.  How did it communicate to women that if they're raped, it's their fault?  Did it also communicate to women that if they're raped, their hair will turn into snakes?  Did it also communicate... Are women that fucking stupid?  that that's the message they got from it as well?  I mean, come on, man.  This is fucking ridiculous.  No woman has ever seen that statue.  The original one, not the copied one.  Um... No woman has ever seen that and thought, oh my God, look at that.  That's telling women that have been raped that they're to blame.  Nobody's ever done this before.  It's just such a sad attempt to say to feminists, I'm one of you guys.  I'm one of the good guys.  I'm an ally.  Rapist.  She is alive after the battle with Perseus, and that's significant, Carbati said of his \u00a3100 statue.  \u00a3100?  That's far too light.  It's supposed to be a feminist icon.  She'd be at least 500.  According to the myth.  That's right.  Myth.  It's a myth.  That's why she had snake hair.  You know?  Because it was a fucking myth.  According to the myth, she should be the one dead and beheaded.  That's the most important thing you can say about this sculpture, but also that she has defended her life and set a boundary.  What?  So wait a minute, she chopped an innocent guy's head off and that's her defending her life and setting a boundary?  What?  However, the concept of the statue fell flat among some feminists.  Of course it did.  You cannot make these people happy.  They're like women.  Feminists are very similar to women.  You cannot make them happy.  I know how to make women happy.  And I really actually mean that.  I know the secret to making women happy.  You want me to tell you?  Make them unhappy.  That's the only thing that makes them happy.  That's it.  That's the secret.  Make them unhappy and they will fucking love that shit.  They fucking love being unhappy.  Give them something to complain about.  With people taking to Twitter to express their disappointment, that's unusual, people expressing disappointment on Twitter.  If this is supposed to be so empowering for women, I would read that one.  One person said, pretty sure most people are just going to be confused, we should read that one as well.  Activist Wagatwe Wanjuki, that's a character out of Black Panther, isn't it?  Wrote on Twitter, me too was started by a black woman.  Right.  But a sculpture of a European character by a dude is the commentary that gets centered.  Sigh.  See, I mean, so we've all to take Me Too seriously.  We've all to get involved and we've all to listen to women and believe all women and all that.  But men aren't allowed to say anything or highlight it or what?  This Me Too movement's important.  Shut up.  You're white.  You don't get a say.  And you're male.  You don't get a say.  Okay, in that case, I won't say anything about Me Too then.  I won't highlight anything then.  Okay.  So only black women, only black women can say anything about Me Too then.  Others were more receptive to the statue's intended feminist reading.  We read that one as well.  Now, Gherbati deliberately wanted to place the statue near the Manhattan Supreme Court where movie mogul Harvey Weinstein was convicted of rape and other sexual offences and sentenced to 23 years behind bars.  Yes, that's where Harvey Weinstein was railroaded by the system.  Yes, yes, we know.  Really surprised because he's Jewish.  I'm really surprised he got railroaded like that.  But he'd probably get sent to, you know, that Jewish prison they've got where it's, like, nice and safe.  I don't think he'll be in with, like, the black gang members for some reason.  The image has been related to justice and there is no better place for her to be, he said.  Beck Anderson, who's the founder of the Medusa with the Head project, and worked with Garbati to bring the work to New York.  Added, what I hope she represents is surviving assault.  She wasn't raped.  She wasn't raped.  It's mythology that nobody was raped.  And the official story is that she was seduced.  So let's not... I mean, if we're going to go back to ancient Greece and mythology... Fucking hell, with today's standards?  Jesus Christ, everybody was raped and everybody was a rapist.  then, if that's the case.  Surviving assault is nothing to be ashamed of.  Who said it was?  Medusa can help put a vision in people's minds that there is no shame in speaking out, defending yourself and demanding justice.  Wait a minute, no, no, no.  What if men see this, right?  What if men see this statue and think that if I do my job, I'll end up getting my head cut off?  You know, wouldn't that send a message to men?  You know, wouldn't men be terrified?  Oh, no, because they're not as pathetic as women.  I keep forgetting.  Sorry.  Sorry about that.  I keep forgetting.  Let's see a few of the comments before I, you know, let's see.  View all and then still show more, right?  nice tits.  if feminists don't like it then it must be good skinny.  has anyone ever seen a feminist who wasn't overweight?  there actually are some but they make up for the lack of weight with the complete country attitude you know.  um the greek myths and the old testament are filled with violence.  remember the dismembered concubine.  i mean they are.  they are that's the thing they are and we need to stop.  We need to stop judging people and things of the past by today's ridiculous fucking standards.  We need to stop doing it.  And anyway, how do we know that Medusa identified as a woman in the first place, you know?  Are we going to go down that road as well?  We might as well, right?  She was first turned into a beast by Athens for having sex in her temple.  Hardly demonstrates sisterly solidarity.  Obviously, she did not punish her male partner, Poseidon.  Could hardly be a less appropriate myth, even when the killing is inverted, for what it is supposed to be for.  Though perhaps it does with its woke ignorance and dishonesty.  Skinny, if that was a real person, her BMI would be 22, which is considered healthy for women.  Nah, but it's not considered empowering for women.  Empowering for women is like land whale stuff, you know?  Her thang looks too big.  Brilliant.  Disgusting, tacky, and obscene.  Wait till the derelicts come by and start humping it.  Have some sense in the core.  It is kind of tacky as well, aye.  It's tacky and it's obscene, but that's the point of feminist... art is that they do these things, I mean I'm surprised that the whole statue wasn't made of used tampons.  you know, they do these things because they want your reaction to be oh my god that's, that's disgusting, don't put that in public so that they can then say oh my god look how women are treated in the art world.  you know Van Gogh didn't have to put up with this shit you know.  and then they can complain about how fucking difficult it is being a female artist, you know, and then there'll be another hashtag, fucking me too art, you know, and then we'll all have to hear about that, and then all women on Twitter will be like, oh, I'm an artist, I draw or something, and I find it difficult to have a career in this fucking male fucking dominated environment.  Fuck off, man, just fucking fuck off, you bullshit, man.  Fuck's sake.  That's why they do it.  That's why feminist art is always, it always involves something like period blood or tampons or vaginas or period blood made of tampons or tampons made of vaginas or some bullshit like that.  Because they're fucking obsessed with their fucking genitals to the point of being utterly disgusting.  And yet, it's men that get told we're obsessed.  Great stuff.  Anyway, sorry, I got distracted there for a while.  Let's go back to my review of Clash of the Titans.  It's okay, you know, if you like that kind of thing.  I suppose.  Anyway, thank you very much for watching my movie review.  I really hope you enjoyed it.  Let me know if there's any other movies you want me to review.  And I'll leave it there for now.  Until next time. ",
