            "text": "Our data is available.  Our data is transparent.  In fact, actor Burks has talked multiple times about how Florida has the absolute best data.  So any insinuation otherwise is just typical partisan narrative trying to be spun.  And part of the reason is that because you got a lot of people in your profession who waxed poetically for weeks and weeks about how Florida was going to be just like New York.  Wait two weeks, Florida's going to be next.  Just like Italy, wait two weeks.  Well, hell, we're eight weeks away from that, and it hasn't happened.  Not only do we have a lower death rate, well, we have way lower deaths generally, we have a lower death rate than the Acela Corridor, DC, everyone up there.  We have a lower death rate than the Midwest, Illinois, Michigan, Indiana, Ohio.  But even in our region, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Florida has the lower death rate.  I was the number one landing spot from tens of thousands of people leaving the number one hot zone in the world to come to my state.  So we've succeeded.  And I think that people just don't want to recognize it because it challenges their narrative.  It challenges their assumption.  So they got to try to find a boogeyman.  Maybe it's that there are black helicopters circling the Department of Health.  If you believe that, I got a bridge in Brooklyn.  I'd like to sell you.  Last question. ",
