            "text": "So I want to welcome all our new members, thousands of people flooding into BillOReilly.com, watching us on the first TV because of the collapse of the television news industry, which I predicted eight, nine months ago.  And the prediction was based on that.  the TV news industry either hated or loved Donald Trump.  That drove most of their programming.  They didn't bother really to cover the rest of the country.  It was all Trump's the devil or Trump's the greatest.  Matters no more Trump.  I mean, he's going out with a bang with the impeachment and all that.  But nevertheless, it's over.  And so where are they going to go?  And in the process, the television news industry, as well as the newspapers, have lost most credibility because they didn't tell their audience the truth.  And when you don't do that and you're in the truth business, the fact business, you know, not everybody.  There are people who don't mind being lied to.  However, I think most Americans, when they are lied to and misled consciously, they don't really like that.  And they're looking around for another alternative.  And here we are.  Hi.  Here we are.  So, you know, we say this a number of times, but the new viewers may not have heard it.  It's good to watch this program with a pen and a pad of paper because we give you so much information and the information is important to you because I'm sure you have discussions with other people about your country.  And those discussions become much more worthy of if you, the honest American, know what you're talking about.  Not theory, opinion, all of that, but facts.  And you can weave together your view of the world in a cogent manner.  So that's what we're going to give you tonight.  I mean, we're going to begin, of course, with the final strategy to destroy Donald Trump.  There is no doubt that that's what this is all about.  It's not about the country.  It's not about the electoral process, the election.  It's not about even the insurrection in Washington last week.  Not about any of that.  All right.  It's about destroying a human being named Donald Trump forever.  That's what it's about.  All right.  Let's walk through it.  So yesterday, the House, along party lines with 10 Republican defections, voted to impeach Donald Trump once again for inciting an insurrection.  That's what they say.  Okay, now, anybody paying attention knows there's an exculpatory, that means a fact-based innocence piece of evidence, That is obvious, and that's the speech.  I'm not going to play you the clip again.  Everybody in the pro-Trump camp has heard it, has played it, but he basically said, not basically, he said directly to his people, I want you to be peaceful and patriotic.  I don't want you to cause any trouble.  That was before the Capitol breach.  Now, last night, as predicted, there was a celebration about the impeachment of Donald Trump.  Go. ",
