Guys, just so you know, hey, speaking of reading theory, just so you fucking know, just so you realize, when Marx and following theorists wrote on capitalism, they were not writing.  capitalism and liberalism are worst things to ever happen to humanity.  They are greatest oppressor of workers.  No, no.  Marxism is supposed to be an extension of liberalism, not a rejection of it.  A true promotion of unity, fraternity, and freedom and liberty and shit.  That's what Marxism and that's what leftism is about.  It's about bringing the messaging of the liberal movement forward to make it better, to make it stronger, to make it true to its principles. ",

            "text": "This is what Vosch said.  Think about really what he just said.  As I said on Twitter, if at this point you don't think that Vosh is COINTELPRO, or at the very least being promoted by COINTELPRO, I'm sorry, you're not a Marxist.  Okay, here's the problem.  There is a difference between social liberality and liberalism.  But Vosch is not talking about social liberality.  He's talking about liberalism, which is capitalism.  Now, combine that with what he has said in the past about Joe Biden.  Vote for Joe Biden or I'm going to kick your ass.  Think about that.  If this isn't the very essence of liberalism, what is?  Come on, this is COINTELPRO straight up.  Intentional or unintentional.  Okay.  Here's why what he said is actually wrong.  Now, if we go back to the beginning... Essentially, when the French Revolution happened, there were three camps.  Conservatism, liberalism, and leftism.  Now, conservatism, despite being a little socially progressive, was essentially for keeping the monarchy.  Liberalism was for creating a democratic bourgeois republic.  Leftism was for abolishing that whole system together.  Socialism.  Different interpretations of what socialism is, but nonetheless, they were anti-capitalist.  They were anti what it was both the conservatives and the liberals actually wanted.  So not only does Vos literally not know what liberalism is and where it comes from, at least its history... He is a liberal.  There is no question at this point.  This guy is outright reactionary.  It is done.  I mean, he already outed himself as very... a questionable character when he defended... That thing where you're sexually attracted to children.  If you say the word, you get demonetized.  And in his debate with Caleb Maupin, he proved that he literally couldn't string two words together for an argument, either.  But here's another question.  Where the hell is BreadTube?  Why isn't BreadTube saying anything?  I mean, come on, this guy is supposed to be literally the opposite of Marxism and anarchism while claiming to be a Marxist and anarchist and flip-flopping between the two frequently.  If you're not, like, where are they?  Why aren't they saying something right now?  I'm sorry, but this is complete and utter nonsense.  If this isn't definitive proof that Bosch is a reactionary to you, then there's no hope for you.  Thank you for watching.
