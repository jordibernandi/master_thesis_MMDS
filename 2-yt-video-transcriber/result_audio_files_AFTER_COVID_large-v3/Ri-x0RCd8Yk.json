            "text": "So many of you have liked my videos where I do a deep dive into various communities and talk about their infiltration or the sizable portion of those communities who happen to be on the alt-right or neo-nazis.  Now this video is going to take a look at something that is both quite obvious in terms of.  you see a lot of memes from the alt-right with warhammer 40k imagery but it's also going to talk about more general issues rather than just I guess a segment of their audience and their fan base being Nazis.  There's a broader problem about the advertising of this game which is really interesting and for those of you who might not know what Warhammer 40k is I say game but it's of course a tabletop game but it's a franchise that also has video games as well but most of this revolves around the actual tabletop Although the world that has been created for Warhammer 40k, which applies to the video games, is relevant when we're discussing, I guess, the fascism in the community.  But just before we get into the video, if you like my content, if you like my channel, please like the video, maybe subscribe, it really helps me out.  Also, check out my Patreon and my social medias in the description.  So to start with, let's talk about the world that Warhammer 40K takes place in.  So the 40K aspect applies to it being about 40,000 years in the future.  But I want to focus on the Imperium here, a faction of Warhammer 40K.  So the humans of Warhammer 40K live in a fascist political system.  The government has unrestricted power.  The citizens have next to no rights.  Military service is near universal and compulsory and multiple branches of government and military have no accountability.  The state-sponsored religion is mandatory and repressive and the government is built around xenophobia, both figuratively and literally, with hatred of any human outside except the norms is also written into the state policy as well as hatred of aliens in the Warhammer universe.  It's been repeatedly established within the canon that life for the average citizen is garbage.  The system is inefficient to an almost comical degree, with starvation that is rampant and planets that are left abandoned to their horrifying fates because no one is often aware they're in trouble.  The military often spends most of its time squabbling with other elements of the military.  It's just a massive satire of fascism in general.  But the problem really comes with the Imperium being the main human factor.  and a lot of the times when you have humans in a sci-fi universe you automatically identify with the humans because of course we are humans.  so if they're fighting aliens you are sort of on their side.  it's kind of like you know the Avatar films where of course you know the humans in.  that are the bad guys.  it's quite easy to identify with them even the ones who are in the military.  and when they have awesome tech like these massive mechs and massive ships people tend to you know gravitate towards them.  So despite the humans in Warhammer being the bad guys, because they're a main faction, because they have cool armour, they have cool military tech, people gravitate towards them.  Of course you don't have to be a fascist to like the Imperium, the same way you don't have to be a fascist to like the cool technology of the Empire and Star Wars, but of course if you are a fascist you probably are going to lean more towards these guys and you're going to see them as the good guys.  But just on screen.  quick i'm going to put some images of the imperium up as you can see their armor sort of appeals to this old i guess fascist iconography.  it reminds me of people like franco idealizing things like philip ii in spain.  generally yeah it looks like fascist propaganda a mixture of things like medieval knights and you know general fascists from the 1940s and their armies.  and while you can just respect the art and you respect how these are cool i'm going to put some more stuff up.  so this is how it used by the alt-right.  Here are some things with Trump, the God Emperor.  Here are some more, you know, generally fascist uses of the artwork, of the figures, of the technology, basically showing how those of a fascist leaning will, of course, like this stuff.  Now, I want to take this all back to the point about the humans being the good guys, because with the original intention of creating this universe, the humans are not the good guys.  But this is a problem in terms of the marketing of the game, in which they have to often simplify this universe to appeal for children.  Now, it's kind of hard to get across the complex themes of satire, but they often depict it as humans, good, and that is your entry point into it.  But this also links to more general alt-right people in the community.  to go over this as part of covering a general scandal that has happened lately with games workshop and the warhammer community so vice reporting this month so many warhammer fans are becoming increasingly uncomfortable with the alt-right faction of the fandom flowering in certain online corners.  one group taking action is no more damsels a charity calling for a more inclusive atmosphere in the london war gaming scene and warhammer is actually massive in the uk.  so members want games workshop which is a big outlet in the uk that sells warhammer stuff to outline specific plans to tackle racism sexism and homophobia and other forms of prejudice in the war gaming community.  last month no more damsels co-founder sarah pipkin helped to write an open letter addressed to the games workshop calling out bigotry and warhammer and quote providing a So.  this was signed by multiple groups and players are asking for great representation and a more inclusive atmosphere.  of course there was a huge pile on by the alt-right.  so the no more damsels open letter was a response to a statement issued by games workshop on the 4th of june which was committing to diversifying its models and keeping racism out of its stores and communities.  but pitkin says that a broad anti-racist message was encouraging.  but they'd hoped the games workshop would have outlined a more practical response.  but others also believe the marketing strategy of warhammer is feeding into a far-right community.  So Vice also reporting Thomas Parrott freelance for Games Workshop until June writing novels for its Black Library publishing arm.  He thinks they're adopting a surface level narrative of good guys versus bad guys in a bid to appease the parents of younger customers who might otherwise be put off by 40k's cartoonishly grim lore.  and it opens the door to a simplified reading of the game.  So he said it's really easy to misinterpret the Imperium of Man as being presented as a good thing as opposed to what it originally was which was lampooning the very idea of a totalitarian state.  So I can totally understand how this type of marketing sees young people come into the community and not really understand what Warhammer is saying because of course they might not be politically minded.  but if you're just like here are the humans, the good guys, look at their awesome... technology and tanks and armor and look here are all the alien hordes which they're fighting because they're trying to kill them.  and again it really is too simple.  i guess it kind of reminds me in a weird way of the marketing for the new star wars films where it's like which side will you pick?  will you pick the resistance or the first order when the first order are like blowing up planets and killing billions of people?  sometimes i just think you have to be a bit more on the nose of your marketing being like yeah these guys aren't great but of course they're worried about their sales.  so for Of course the alt-right had a reaction to the recent criticisms of the Games Workshop and the Warhammer 40k community and one of them is a pretty big YouTuber.  so a Norwegian YouTuber called Arch launched an email campaign in July urging his 200,000 subscribers to email Games Workshop and tell them to keep the politics out.  Arch says he does not identify as a member of the far-right and insists that he was genuinely not aware of any alt-right or fascist section of the 40k community.  Rather, he takes the view that Games Workshop's statement was tantamount to a line itself of extremists who support communism and says advocate violence.  Even on the surface, it does kind of seem like he is on the alt-right.  So he says, for me, this is the same kind of dog whistling that we hear about for the alt-right, where they talk about some of their code phrases.  This seems to me to be a signal to a very small group of extreme people.  What my campaign is saying is that Warhammer is for everyone, full stop.  So he also went on to say, if you are the most extreme tanky or even the most extreme fascist, you simply want to play a game of 40k.  not talk about your politics, simply collect the miniatures.  I do not view that as Game Workshop's duty to stop it.  I view that as the rest of society's duty to debate against these people and to prevent them via public discourse and the public opinion.  So just something to point out to everyone, when someone is super anti-communist and they focus on communists and tankies in statements like this, you should be really skeptical because a lot of the time people who are so passionate anti-communist usually are hiding their alt-right sympathies.  so here are some screenshots from his discord where he is openly saying racial slurs.  and of course when you read this it's pretty hard to say this guy is not racist and hold sympathies for the alt-right.  so they're a little hard to read.  so i'm going to read them out.  um but this is from arch's discord.  so um arch in uh march 2020 wait the black people can't even find black history.  then why do we use a month for it?  not sure?  he says dang it no cotton emote obviously referring to slavery.  and when africans and african-americans were forced to pick cotton so another one in march.  black history in three easy steps one get captured by black people.  two get sold by black people.  three get liberated by white people.  any questions of course?  some awful disgusting racist revisionist history.  so arch saying no no no the n-word is not a smart creature.  Since he seems to be on the alt-right, I wouldn't be surprised if he believes in things like cultural Marxism, Jewish Bolshevism, all that type of stuff.  So Arch also saying... oh and they were also the kind of blackies to think.  paint rendered them invulnerable to bullets plus barbed wire.  uh someone when talking about an author saying pretty sure it's a ching chong author obviously a racial slur against asian people.  talking about gypsies he's saying sammy equals gypsy.  but worse at least gypsies only steal things.  it used to be legal to shoot them.  um someone's saying time for a field exercise of live ammo.  someone else saying yeah but those pesky human rights.  and arch says in the 20s the 40s we were so close to solving the problem i don't.  I guess he's talking about the genocide of gypsies by fascists.  So yeah, this arch guy is incredibly racist and it's super problematic.  he has so many subscribers.  Again, when he was even talking about communism, that is a massive red flag and you see his racist beliefs there towards a whole host of groups, Asians.  gypsies, black people.  Someone like Arch shows the problems within the community and like I said there is a left-wing subreddit called sigmarxism and that is good showing you.  there's a lot of good people who enjoy this game and can appreciate you know the fun of playing a tabletop with a well-crafted world while also recognizing that one of the more popular factions is obviously a satire of fascism Not someone like Arch and his followers, who probably are drawn to them because they represent their beliefs.  And with a lot of fascist stuff like that, they often hide behind, I guess, a degree of deniability in terms of, you know, it's just the game, bro.  We just like playing as the Imperium.  We like role-playingism.  And yeah, they might be pretty bad, but we don't... But when you have Arch and his fans talking about how genocide of gypsies is a good thing, talking about slavery, promoting this disgusting historical revisionism that is racist about slavery, talking about whites liberating the slaves, and it's actually black people's fault for the transatlantic slave trade, And it's just clear when the community has a guy like this who is very popular that it does have a problem with fascists.  And I guess it's another problem as well with the diversity of the community because a lot of the time when you have groups like this, like the Imperium and their supporters, you kind of do need another perspective to point out how problematic it is.  A lot of the time when the community is dominated by white people, especially in the West, it seems to be pretty ignorant of racist problems in general, even if if they aren't going into Warhammer because they're fascist.  And as it says with the marketing, they do target young people by trying to make a world that is very complex with its own political systems and political ideologies by boiling it down to the people like you, who are the humans, they are good.  All these scary aliens are the baddies.  And to sum up, I just want to read you the closing paragraph of Dorian Doar's media article called Let's Talk About Warhammer 40k, which really, I guess, summarizes the problems with the marketing, with the Imperium, and why the marketing promoting the Imperium is good can be such a problematic thing.  So, Warhammer 40k is so very close to how fascists see the world.  They are beset on all sides by degeneracy, threatening to choke their way of life, and an ever-present foreign Xenos menace seeking to take. ",
