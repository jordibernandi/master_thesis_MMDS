            "text": "Hi everyone, Sandman here.  This video is brought to you by a donation from Shane and here's what he has to say.  Hey Sandman, I really dig your channel.  I discovered it about four years ago while I was going through a divorce.  It's an interesting story actually.  I made a huge mistake and didn't realize how stupid I was until after it happened.  About five years ago I met a girl when we started living together after about a month.  When I met her, she was a single mom with one other child living in a caravan park.  I felt sorry for her and agreed for her to move into my apartment.  After a few months, she fell pregnant.  Thinking that I was doing the right thing, I proposed to her and we were married before my son was born in April of 2015.  Leading up to the marriage, things were going bad.  But I pushed through and married her anyway.  I did love her, but I also was worried about losing access to my kid.  I felt like she was playing mind games with me the entire time.  She would tell me one thing and others something completely different and would literally make me feel like I was going crazy.  She's a great liar and to this day people believe what she says over anything that I say happened.  After about a month, yes only a month, she decided that she wanted a divorce.  I secretly wanted one as well.  But I really love my son so I fought to keep us together.  Anyway, long story short, she ended up taking off with my son, moving about two hours away.  I found out later that she'd also done this to the father of her first child.  This is where it gets interesting.  I took her to court to get access to my son.  During court, she offered me one hour with my son every second week.  That broke my heart.  During the court process, she was ordered to move my son back to the city that I was living in.  She had to travel two hours every second day in the meantime so I could see my son for three hours.  Little did I know at the time, she was already shacking up with another guy and had fallen pregnant yet again.  Her traveling to the city that I was living in lasted about a month until one day out of the blue.  she asks me if I wanted to have my son live with me because her other four-year-old son was being violent towards our son.  Which, yes, sounds like BS to me too.  Naturally, I agreed.  I did at this stage have suspicion that she was seeing someone new.  I said to her a few words in the effect of, if I find out that you're giving up our son for a guy you've just met, I'll be really upset.  Her response to that was, what's wrong with that?  Needless to say, I was shocked at this response.  I decided at this point that I would give her one month to change her mind.  If he was still with me, I would fight tooth and nail to ensure that he stayed with me.  Anyway, he lived with me for about eight months after that, until one day she was just supposed to return him after her weekend visit.  This particular weekend, however, she decided not to return him.  She had also not moved back to the city that I was living in.  That week, I made an application to the family court to have him return to me.  To my surprise, the matter was listed and heard within three days of me submitting the application.  Usually, it takes three months.  My son has returned to me the day after the court hearing.  I realized that at this stage that he was living with me long enough for me to be seen as the primary caregiver and all the laws that have actually been put in place to benefit women had actually made a switch to where I was benefiting now.  I made an application to the court for final orders and at that time her ex made an application for access to his son.  This made her case even worse as I was able to establish a pattern and it ultimately went to my favor.  What struck me out in all of this was just how easy.  she gave up our son in the beginning for the sake of being with the new guy.  I put my life on hold for a year fighting for him, she gave him up to be with the new guy, and then wanted him back when things were getting better for her.  I find this also interesting.  It's like her need for the status of being in a relationship so this guy would pay her bills trumped the desire to have her son live with her.  It's like the desire to be with him was higher on her priority list than her own child.  Well Shane, thanks for your unbelievable story.

So Shane, I guess all this happened to you because you found me four years ago instead of five.  500 years ago, a woman like this would have been called a witch and probably burned at the stake.  Today, she burns a man by trapping him with a baby and then runs off with another man to eat some steak.  All classic moves.  Let me get this straight.  Trailer park single mama thought traps you by moving into your apartment with their kid and presumably your baby on the way.  Check.  Gets married to you to make it official and makes you think that she's going to be hanging around for the longer term.  Check.  Divorces you and then gets child support money.  Check.  Moves two hours away so you can't even see your own son and so that eventually she can turn him against you.  Meanwhile, gets pregnant a third time with a different father and drops your son off on your doorstep to keep the new guy happy.  Check.  Check, check, check.  On the bright side, since it sounds like you got most of the custody of your son, and you're going your own way, and he's probably five years old now, and trying to avoid playing outdoors with Corona-chan, your life seems great.  You got to procreate and not pay full price.  Of course, you paid in psychological torment that there are women out there willing to abandon their own children to ride a new Chad Thundercock.  Your story kind of reminds me of I'm Serious, a fellow MGTOW that runs his weed shop out in Alberta.  And he's living with his son and his wife is overseas in Asia, it seems.  As for your ex, she's probably looking on the bright side.  At least she has two other kids where the fathers are either paying child support and alimony to her.  So one child got away from her slutty bosoms.  No big deal.  She could always start up a fourth franchise if she's strapped for cash.  If this woman was a used car salesman, she would most likely club a baby seal to make a better deal.  I'm going to guess that you found my channel around the same time that you were fighting for custody and dealing with the shocking behavior on her part.  But you probably wanted to know more about female nature and somehow you ran into my channel that way.  What really bothers me is that less and less, new men are discovering my content and MGTOW content in general.  The effect of that, of course, is that many guys are getting themselves involved with more freeloading women that live on four wheels in trailer parks.  Many of you out there listening in Susan Wojcicki land will realize that Shane met a nice woman that set off all the red flags imaginable.  Women don't like guys sharing notes about women because when we do, shenanigans like these don't happen.  The more single mothers there are, the less fathers are around to raise sons to be aware of this sort of stuff.  So an epidemic of single mothers just leads to men losing their ability to share notes about women between generations.  I, of course, am referring to what few notes were allowed to be shared in a family setting.  It's not just that women have an advantage over men when it comes to discussing men at girls' night outs, but that anyone to actually stop and think that women becoming single mothers might actually be a strategy women take subconsciously to limit the spread of knowledge between men.  Their power exists because we remain in the dark.  Shane, I'm pretty sure that you'd be trying to get your trouser snake down some other single mom's underpants instead of focusing on raising your son if you hadn't discovered MGTOW.  I hope you now know how lucky you are dealing with judges that saw the selfishness of your now ex and how they realized how cruel some females can actually be.  For many of them, their mothering instinct has all but disappeared so Chad can give it to her from the front while Tyrone gives it to her from the rear.  What I find even more interesting is that she's willing to move two hours away from the support network that she has.  Usually women move to where their friends and family live so they can have a social safety net around them.  But something tells me that this woman was probably the type that had little to no friends and probably wasn't on speaking terms with her family.  Many guys might think it doesn't happen, but now you actually have proof that it does.  A while back, the one and only Mr.  Obvious responded to one of my videos about single fathers, and he said that single fathers with a sob story can get a ton of action from women.  Sure, that can happen, but I think it goes much deeper than simply sex.  Shane, I think that when women see you as a single father on the playground with your kid, besides their initial thought that you're a child molester trying to kidnap your own kid, once they learn about your story, even if they aren't interested in you, they might try and hook you up with their far less attractive friends.  Not necessarily because they feel sorry for you or your son, but because he doesn't actually have a female influence in his life there to make his life supposedly better.  Also, you're like a plantation slave without a master.  Ms.  Dravius also stated to me that a single father has also proven to other women out there that he's in desire because he was married before.  So that makes him more attractive than ever.  I agree, but I think it goes much deeper than that.  It means that he's not under control if he's not married.  Plus all the resources that he earns are going to waste on himself, according to women looking from the outside in.  I don't know about you guys, but when I look on Tinder here in Toronto, there are tons of women that clearly say they don't want a man with children.  I guess they want to be the top priority in a guy's life.  But the funny thing is I've seen single mothers say they don't want a man.  that's a single father either.  The double standards from some of these dames are absolutely appalling.  Our desire to procreate means that many of us would gladly bang a trailer trash thought or welfare queen and take her into our home like a stray cat, instead of realizing that we're just too good for her.  Men's weakness is choosing women with looks regardless of if she can balance her books.  But a woman's weakness quite often is choosing a man with a good amount of money, but when she looks at him, he's ugly in her books.  Clearly the priorities of both men and women are messed up these days.  That's why so many impoverished trailer trash gals can find themselves married to millionaires.  That's why sometimes you see billionaires choose to be with women that people see as nobodies.  Jeff Bezos is a good example of that with that girlfriend, Lauren Sanchez.  His affair most likely cost him the billions of dollars that he paid his ex-wife in the divorce.  Lauren Sanchez wasn't exactly trailer trash, but if you're a billionaire and she's an average middle-class woman, or even an upper-class woman, she might as well be.  As for your situation, Shane, we men are dumb when we want to come.  Because we see how women burn other guys and yet we still have no issues getting together with such chicks.  Thinking that they won't do the same to us.  Because she loves us and that we're special.  I wonder if that newest guy that's allowing her to gorge on his gonads is thinking about things the same way.  Or if he's just thinking about what he's doing with that child he has with her.  I'll cover this in a video called, Smart Men Don't Get Married.  I think there's more to relationships between men and women besides how intelligent we as men are.  Perhaps our individual genes as an individual man make some of us more vulnerable to falling in love.  Maybe it's because we're emotionally weak because we never suffered much in life so we get complacent about love.  Maybe we aren't as smart as we think we are.  Why guys that know better marry single mothers, trailer trash welfare queens and choose the worst possible imaginable woman?  because they are hopeless romantics instead of looking at things from a rational point of view.  Why we as men look at all the bright red flags, even after taking the red pill and still choose to smash her fish-flavored pillbox.  Anyways, that's it for today.
