            "text": "We're going to look at verses 4 through 6.  The question is, is that these people, they tasted, it says over here, let me put the words, that way it will be better.  They tasted the heavenly gift, and then they were partakers in the Holy Ghost.  Tasted and partook.  And it says they were once enlightened.  Yes, they were also once enlightened.  That's a good one.  That's the big word, enlightened.  So it's like they have their eyes open, so to speak.  But then, the problem is over here, is that when they once tasted it, that at verse 6, that basically verse 4, it's impossible, verse 6, that they cannot repent because if they did repent and turn back, then it's crucifying again Jesus Christ.  It says over here that Repent and renew.  Alright, so let's explain this passage over here.  First of all, if you look at this passage, that's the reason why a lot of people say that this verse, it doesn't make sense toward the Christian life.  There's a wrong doctrine out there that says that if you receive Christ for your salvation, you are never really saved to begin with.  You didn't actually believe Him by faith to begin with if you mess up your life in sin.  So that's the way that they teach over here.  Well then, that's a problem because over here it says you can't renew them.  You can't have them repent.  Every person always has a chance to repent.  Even, let's say, that person was a false convert.  No matter how hardcore of a lordship salvation you are, lordship salvation, they basically believe that when you believe on Christ for salvation, it's not sufficient.  You have to really give up all your sins.  And if you sin later on, you lost your salvation.  But even one of those hardcore people is not going to turn down a person who repents.  If a person repents, they'll have to say, okay, then you're genuinely saved right here.  But this verse makes it impossible here.  See that?  So it makes more sense that you put this one into a tribulation timeline.  It would make way more sense if you put this inside a tribulation timeline over here.  Now, we're going to look at Hebrews chapter 1.  So here's your chance where it shows that this is a tribulation timeline over here.  Alrighty then.  So we're going to look at the book of Hebrews chapter 1.  Now notice that the passage shows over here that this is actually an application toward the tribulation.  It's not church age.  We're going to look at the book of Hebrews chapter 1.  Let me turn over there.  My hands are kind of slippery, sorry.  The Bible says in verse 2, Hath in these, what?  Last days spoken unto us by his Son.  So the author already gave you a heads up that what he's going to write about is in application to the end times.  In these last days.  Another note is if you look at Hebrews chapter 2.  Hebrews chapter 2.  And then we'll read verse 5.  Hebrews chapter 2, verse 5.  Now this becomes even more plain over here.  It becomes even more plain over here that the application is going to be a tribulation timeline.  Notice the last part reads over there.  For unto the angels hath He not put in subjection the what?  World to come.  See, not the present world like we are in today as a Christian church.  It's a future world.  A future time period world.  But keep reading over here.  It says whereof we speak at verse 5.  So what they're speaking and talking about now in the book of Hebrews is a future time period.  Alright?  Tribulation.  It's that kind of a world.  It's not our current world where we're under the church age.  Now, returning back over here then.  Let's go back to Hebrews.  chapter four.  now notice how this makes it impossible to apply it to church age doctrine for it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and were made partakers of the holy ghost.  verse four shows that these people are saved.  at verse four lordship salvation they try to say they were never saved to begin with.  But actually, no, they are saved because it says over here that it's hard.  Enlightened.  Okay, I get it.  There might be a lost soul who gets enlightened about the gospel eyes open.  And he's like, oh, okay, this makes sense.  Tasted of the heavenly gift.  There might be a lost person who's at the borderline of tasting salvation, but didn't really do it.  But the problem is, verse 4, we're made partakers.  It's a past tense.  It's not like, hey, they were tasting or they were on the borderline of partaking.  No, they were past tense.  already partook in the Holy Ghost.  If you look that up in the Pauline epistles, go look it up yourself.  Partake, partook, Holy Ghost or Spirit.  This is salvation here.  So they're already in salvation here.  So because they're already in salvation over here, That's the reason why that at verse 5, tasted the good word of God and the powers of the world.  Oh, look at that phrase again.  What?  World to come.  That matches with Hebrews chapter 2.  So this is all tribulation application over here.  There is no doubt that all of this timeline is referring to the tribulation application where there's going to be seven vials and there's going to be seven trumpets and then there's going to be seven seals.  So this is all an application toward the tribulation timeline over here actually.  Now, understanding that this is a tribulation timeline, we can see over here, like this maybe, we can see over here that if they tasted it, verse 6, once they have the Holy Ghost, they fall away, that it's impossible to renew them again to repentance because they make the crucifixion of Christ an open shame again.  If you look at actually back at, let's see, following, renew them to repentance.  Holy Ghost, verse 4.  Look at Matthew 25, right?  Matthew chapter 25.  Notice that there is a case of the tribulation where these people have the Holy Ghost, but then they lost it.  So they partook, they have the Holy Ghost in them, but it went out.  It went out.  Look at Matthew chapter 25, verse 1.  Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom.  And five of them were wise and five were foolish.  They that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them.  But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.  While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.  Let's see over here.  Verse 8, and the foolish said unto the wise, give us of your oil, for our what?  Lambs are gone out.  So notice that the ones who were foolish over here, that their lambs went out.  The oil went out.  A lot of commentators say that that's referring to the Holy Ghost.  So then they teach about losing the Holy Ghost for salvation.  But actually, it makes way more sense that when you're talking about these lamps, that this is an application toward the tribulation timeline.  All right, so... it goes out.  The Holy Spirit they partook, but it went out.  And that's the reason why, if you look at the last part, they're not saved.  Because if you look at verse 12, but he answered and said, he said to those foolish ones who ran out of the Holy Spirit, the oil, he says, verily I say unto you, what?  I know you not.  That's a phrase that God gives to lost people before he damns them to hell.  He says, I never knew you depart from ye that work iniquity.  And those same people are the ones that says, Lord, haven't we prophesied in your name, done many miracles in your name,  etc.,  etc.?  See that?  How about it?  So we see over here that this is, it makes a lot more sense when you apply it toward a tribulation timeline, a tribulation timeline over here.  Now, I can give you one way of getting around this, which is very, very clever, actually.  If you go to Hebrews chapter 4, 6, Hebrews 6.  The clever way that you can get around this, which it can actually support eternal security.  And remember, book of Hebrews is not just tribulation application.  It's a what kind of application?  Double application.  So it can be for church age.  Can a church age saint use Hebrews 6 for eternal security?  Well, it sounds like over here, no, because you're losing salvation.  It's the opposite of eternal security.  But there's a clever way where you can see it, that it supports eternal security.  It shows over here that verse 4, if they partook in the Holy Ghost... And then verse 6, that they have to, they cannot repent again.  They cannot be renewed.  Why?  Because in verse 4, the last part of verse 4, if you partook in the Holy Ghost... It says the beginning, it is what?  Impossible.  So in other words, if you did taste the Holy Ghost or you got saved, you partook in the Holy Ghost, it's impossible for you to fall away to sin and mess up and then renew them again to repentance where you don't receive the salvation of the cross again.  Because why?  Because if you fall away into sin, Jesus Christ can't die a second time.  That sacrifice is one time and it covers you.  It covers you forever.  So that's how you can cleverly apply that to the church age, actually.  Some people who are weak dispensationalists or anti-dispensationalists, they love this interpretation because they apply everything to the church.  So then they say, so we can say this is doctrinally for the church then, 100%.  No, you have to put double application because you can't get around.  Hebrews chapter 10.  Look at Hebrews 10, it repeats that.  Hebrews 10, there's no way around this.  In Hebrews chapter 10, It says over here at verse 29... Of how much sore punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden underfoot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace.  Now that wording is undoubtedly matching with Hebrews 6, right?  About crucifying the Son of God afresh, disgracing His sacrifice.  There's no doubt.  it's the same context.  It's the same thing.  But look how the person words it over here.  The person words it over here at verse 38.  Now the just shall live by faith, but if any man draw back... See, you fall back.  My soul shall have no pleasure in him, but we are not of them who draw back unto where?  Perdition.  See, go to hell.  But of them that believe to the saving of the soul.  How about that over there?  Also, if you look at verse 27... I mean, look at that.  But verse 26, actually, 26 and 27.  For if we sin willfully, see that?  If you sin again, after that we have received the knowledge of the truth.  Look at this.  There remaineth no more sacrifice for sins.  This sounds like Hebrews 6.  Verse 27.  But a certain fearful looking for of judgment.  Well, it could be God chastising.  And what?  fiery indignation.  See, that's hell fire, but if you're not convinced, which shall devour the who?  Adversaries.  If you're a lost sinner, you're considered to be the adversary, the enemy of God.  Romans chapter 5 mentions over there that for when we were enemies, right?  See, lost in sin, headed for hell, Christ died for us, right?  So there's no doubt that you have to realize that, look, Christians can apply it that way since it's double application for Hebrews 6, but you can't make that 100%, all right?  Because why?  If you honestly go by context with Hebrews chapter 10, you can't escape a tribulation application there. ",
