            "text": "Hey, flip that bitch.  What's going on?  This is my life when it shot me.  Host Donald Washington.  Now, yesterday, June 19th, Trey Savage was viciously shot on the 81st block of South Evans.  His real name is Contre Young, 26 years old.  Rolled off a Chief Keef label, Glory Boys Entertainment.  Also, he rolled with Chief Keef gang, Glow Gang.  Now, a lot of crazy stuff was happening yesterday.  I want to show you guys the crime chaser.  He reported this yesterday.  I saw this post yesterday.  He has the police scanner that he pays attention to, and he's hearing all these calls coming in on his police scanner.  He's saying that his squad is back in Chicago killing black people again in a black, gray, and a white SUV speeding off from the crime scene without any description of the driver's license plate.  And what is the description of the suspects in this case?  Witness reports seeing a white SUV, possibly a Mazda, in the area of the time of the shooting.  Also, yesterday at night, this happened.  Man dead in Bronzeville hit and run.  Complete separate incident.  People were seeing a white, gray, or black vehicle.  Vehicles speed off from the scene.  Now, I want to show you guys his Instagram page.  No murders are being solved.  I think that the police are protesting us protesting them.  I think this is his girl right here.  This is on his Instagram page.  I'm not sure.  But he hugged up with her.  He got his hand on her butt like that's his girl or something.  I want to show you guys his Instagram page.  I also want to show you guys on where it happened.  Now this is where it happened right here.  I want to show you guys.  Right down here on this block.  Eddie Ferguson Evans.  He was going to see his girl.  And he also lived in the Chatham neighborhood.  So that's what I'm saying, man.  A lot of these rappers, man, y'all can't go off what they're saying.  They in the safe Beverly Hills neighborhood in California.  Chief Keef live in California in the Beverly Hills.  He's safe.  For a lot of these young rappers that ain't made it out the hood yet, man, you cannot be rapping talking about who you want to shoot, who you want to kill.  This is Instagram page right here.  I don't know who this young girl is, man.  Man, I hope that ain't his daughter or something.  But this is Instagram page right here.  And I kept seeing some young girl, some young lady, man, who he was saying, this hurts so bad, baby.  Damn, you was my queen.  It's changed my life.  There's so much death and destruction going on in Chicago.  The police can't even solve 11% of the murders.  They're protesting us protesting them.  They're saying, okay, y'all want to protest us?  We're going to show y'all.  We ain't solving no murders.  And we gonna let y'all have at it.  And once somebody get away with murder once, they gonna come back two, three, four, five times.  That's just a fact.  Look like they had a grave site here.  Blood in, blood out.  These streets is dangerous, young brothers.  I'm trying to tell y'all, it ain't worth it.  It ain't worth your life.  Cats are jealous of you, envious.  They know you about to make it out the hood, and they ain't.  They think you might, they lyrics, yo, you might be better than them.  You probably got more ladies than them, more jewelry, more clothes than them.  And they jealous, and they envious.  And he want what you have.  The streets do not love you back.  That's why it's time to get off the streets.  The streets don't love you back.  This is him here.  Look like a nice young brother, man.  That's the other cat for Chicago.  I forgot his name.  that died, man.  I forgot his name.  But he also died in Chicago too, man.  A lot of rappers are getting on for Chicago from Chief Keith.  He opened a lot of doors.  I give him that.  I give him that twin daddy love.  You baby and little princess, happy birthday.  Oh no, he was a father.  Little cuz, virtual graduation, congratulations.  Man.  So, you know, man, you know, only 26 years old, man.  He had the whole life ahead of him.  It probably was a setup, man.  Anybody could have known, you know, that he lived in that community.  Friends, people he knew.  People we knew, somebody, it's a crazy world out here in these streets.  But man, if you live in Chicago, in these south side, west side, man, y'all got to get out of there, man.  If you're anywhere from 12 to 26, 28, you got to get about these communities, man, because the police are stepping down.  They're watching this.  go on, man.  Not even 11% out of 750 murders last year.  That's bananas.  That's why they're saying we need to defund the police, and I'm with them.  I'm with them.  Because if you can't do 11% of your job, something's wrong.  Either you can't do it, either you're incompetent or pretended to be incompetent.  Either way, you got to go.  Anyway, man, I don't think it's justice for his family, man.  You young brothers, man, it ain't worth your life, this rap game, man.  These are actors.  A lot of them Hollywood actors, man, they in their studio in the Hollywood Hills, man, safe.  So they can rap about shooting up, bang, bang, this, that, and the other, and beefing with these cats like you see 50 and all them.  They in big mansions in the Hollywood Hills.  But if you on the streets, still on the streets and you a rapper, man, very dangerous.  Anyway, I want you guys to like, comment, let me know what you think about this video.  Peace, peace. ",
