I swear to God, do it.  Take a step back and sit down now.  No.  What's up, dudes and dudettes?  AFA here.  Just real quick, we go and film.  These cops pull out a friggin' baton for filming.  You can see this guy just going, oh, let's go, man, let's go.  Pulls out his baton.  He just wants to beat something.  Okay?  Then, when his supervisor shows up, they try and say that we were trying to break in his car.  Sorry, dude.  Got it on camera.  By the way, share, like, and subscribe.  Set the notification bell to always to our friends at San Joaquin Transparency.  Right?  We love San Joaquin Valley Transparency and San Joaquin News Network.  Killing it, brother.  We love you.  And also, News New England.  What's happening?  Smash that like button.  Enjoy the video.  I know you will.  We hate them.  We hate them when they're assholes.  Hey, you better stop flashing your light in my face.  You better stop flashing your light in my face.  You better back off.  What's up?  I swear to God, do it.  Take a step back.  Sit down now.  No.  I swear to God, do it.  Take a step back.  Sit down now.  No.  Don't touch him.  Don't touch him.  I would suggest you put your hands off him and keep them there.  Put that away.  What's all this about?  Step back.  You just approached him with a weapon.  Because you guys are on my cruiser.  That's a public easement.  Are you out of your mind?  Get your supervisor and do it now.  So you pulled out a baton on him for standing on a public easement?  Have you, are you stuck on stupid today?  Stupid?  I suggest you guys move it along.  No, I suggest you shut up.  We woke up and we saw you trying to break into one of our crews.  No, no, because the whole thing's unfilmed.  And I'll film your crews all I want.  We got body cams, POV cams, regular glasses.  Well, guess what?  We're here and you weren't.  He pulled out a baton because he filmed.  Get your supervisor, Doyle.  Go ahead.  Get your supervisor, Doyle.  You guys fucked up.  For what?  You guys fucked up.  You messed up.  What's the chances?  you just pulled the baton on one of the biggest civil rights activists in the country?  Alright, so what are the chances?  I walked out?  100%.  But then what'd you do?  You pulled it out, you aimed it at him, which is assault.  Yeah, but he came close to me, yeah.  Which is assault.  You came to him.  You came to him.  It's all on video, dude.  Okay, yeah, it is all on video.  We're all set.  No, you're not.  Not until we get your supervisor here.  Then we're all set.  I'm an independent journalist.  I'm an independent journalist.  I came to cover the firefighters and whatever was going on.  And you walked up on him.  You said your man was breaking into our car.  No, that's not true.  That's not true.  He didn't touch it.  I got it all on film.  Okay, so you want to play it back for us then?  I don't have to.  Are you accusing him of a crime?  Is he detained?  Is he detained?  Then he's free to go.  So you have no PC or RAS to believe he's done anything wrong.  Yes, we do.  We have 100% all of that.  Oh, you do?  When we came out here, I saw it with my two eyes.  You did?  He was breaking into the car.  Oh, you did?  So you were able to see through the fucking vehicle?  Yes, when he's leaning over into our car.  Come on, dude.  So if you think someone's breaking into your car, you approach him and say, stop shining the camera in our car, and then you pull a baton.  You guys are so out of your league.  So is this breaking in your car?  Is this breaking in your car?  I need your supervisor.  Is that him?  No, that's not my supervisor.  All right, well, get your supervisor.  Get your supervisor.  Pull in.  You can pull in.  Get your supervisor.  No.  Get your supervisor.  There's no reason to.  Get your supervisor.  What do you need?  Do you want to call a complaint?  I want your supervisor.  I'll give you the number right now.  I want your supervisor.  You'll get your supervisor.  There you go.  Get your supervisor.  Call that number.  Get your supervisor.  Get your supervisor.  Here you go.  Get your supervisor.  Get your supervisor.  Do it now.  We need that.  We need him here.  Fire was saying they were trying to jimmy the door over here to try and get in the car.  So we came out and saw him jimmying the trunk.  They didn't.  He was leaning forward like this.  We couldn't exactly tell what he was doing.  They didn't.  Because we got body cams, point of view cams, regular phones.  We got people walking.  So first of all, what you're trying to do is cover up for the fact that you're an idiot.  You pulled a baton on an unarmed citizen.  is what you fucking did.  So let's shut up.  You're an all set guy.  Be careful, sir.  Just by sitting there, he might use that thing.  You be careful, man.  I'm still going to rest, dude.  Get back down.  We're dealing with some serious police action up here.  Go back and get a supervisor, though.  Go back upstairs.  Get a supervisor.  Are you getting a supervisor?  No, I'm not.  Oh, you're not?  Who's getting a supervisor?  What is that?  You guys are going to be famous.  Hey, get a supervisor.  Are you the supervisor?  Can you get him for me?  He's in there?  I think he is.  I don't know.  Why don't we find out?  I already did.  What's your name?  Mine?  Yes.  Officer Rosa.  Okay.  Officer Rosa, what's your name, man?  I can't hear you.  I'm sorry.  Oh, my God.  Look at this mess.  Look at this mess.  Because I want to mind your own business and shut up.  Why am I looking in the car?  If I felt like talking to you, I'd be talking to you still, right?  Shut up.  I'm sorry, I don't speak big Latin, bro.  My bad.  Into, oh, he's breaking in the cruiser.  So he has, by the way, he should be a fucking superhero because he's able to see through a fire truck and then through the vehicle to see what he's doing.  Because we got four different camera angles on this thing, all right?  So what he did is he saw someone filming, thought that he was going to violate his rights, pulled out his baton, acted like an asshole, and now he's going to be fucking famous.  And I don't think cops need that right now, do you?  Gotta learn, man.  I don't think you guys need that right now.  But asking you shall receive.  I'm like the Santa Claus that ends qualified immunity.  That's who I am.  Keep that light out of my eye, please.  No.  Do something, old man.  I don't know you and I don't want to.  Oh wow, he's got pretty good moves for someone that was almost just illegally beaten.  Pretty cool.  Can you do the Dougie or the stanky leg?  You don't have a stanky leg?  It's like, do the stanky leg.  Do the stanky leg.  Dude, that leg is way too stanky.  You're gonna break an ankle, man.  I wonder what the name of this video will be.  I wonder what the name of this video is going to be.  That's all right.  Everything that's written on those notepads I got now, so we'll just work on that.  Yeah, 4K.  Don't you know?  the government pays for this?  Does it?  I don't know.  The government pays for everything I do.  It's a write-off, man.  The government or the taxpayers?  No, the government, man.  Who pays you?  Taxpayers.  Taxpayers, right?  Yeah.  You know who pays me?  Not the taxpayers.  I don't know.  Where does the IRS go through?  Taxpayers or the federal government?  Do you even have any fucking idea of the goings-on of normal America?  I want to talk to you.  Okay.  So then shut the fuck up.  Then shut up.  Then shut up.  Then shut up.  Then shut up.  Okay.  So shut up.  Cool.  Awesome.  What do you call two cops playing tug-of-war?  What do you, Rosa, what do you call two cops playing tug-of-war?  Pulled pork.  It's pretty good.  Did you stop it?  Did you correct it?  Did you get us a supervisor?  So you're guilty by association, right?  You know, your qualified immunity is out the door as soon as you don't correct your partner.  Hi, man.  You didn't try to swing it on me, man.  So fucked.  This video is going to go viral.  Did I make you nervous, man?  Keep turning around.  Make you nervous?  I bet a baton made that guy nervous.  I got a camera.  It's not as dangerous as a baton.  Don't be nervous.  Don't fear the camera, fear the people that watch through my lens.  At least you left them notes out for us.  What's up Baton Rouge?  You guys are not being held anymore?  We weren't being held in the first place.  No, you weren't.  You were being detained.  No, we weren't.  For the notice.  No, we weren't.  I was never detained.  No, I wasn't.  You can go fuck off.  That's a number.  Take your detainment and blow, bro.  Choking a dick, guy.  Thanks, guys.  Appreciate it.  Yeah, choking a dick, bro.  Control your emotions, man.  Choking a dick, man, please.  See that guy?  He thinks it's funny.  Coward.  So, guys, just so you know, if you are in the capital of Connecticut, right, and you feel like pulling out your camera for any reason, camera equals baton.  And they are fucked.  That's the reason that I am getting them fired today. ",
