My father and grandfather both served for decades in our country's armed forces.  Since leaving the Navy, I've been involved in various successful businesses, both in this country and abroad.  I'm making this statement to set the record straight about the involvement of the Biden family, Vice President Biden, his brother, Jim Biden, and his son, Hunter Biden, in dealings with the Chinese.  I've heard Joe Biden say that he's never discussed business with Hunter.  That is false. ",
