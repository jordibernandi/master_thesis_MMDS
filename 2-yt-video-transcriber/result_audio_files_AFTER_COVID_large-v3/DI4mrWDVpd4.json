When we usually talk about our African leaders, it's not always in a good light, mostly in a bad light, and rightfully so.  But there are a few instances they made us speechless, as well as the Western powers.  It's nice for a change to see other nations.  just be quiet and be in shock that an African leader said that to you.  I want you to watch this top five instances.  African leaders made the rest of the world speechless. ",

Mr.  Buckingham, just tell them for the last time, just as a message that you have heard for the last time from here, that there should be real equality in the Security Council.  We can't just be coming to the General Assembly to make empty all the speeches and go back home.  Nobody takes care of all the concerns we express.  No.  And anyway, the headquarters of the United Nations is misplaced.  Where do you have most of the people?  We have 1.2 million people in India, 1.3 in China, and Africa, we are getting to nearly a billion also.  Now put us together, just these three.  And then put those with the white faces and pink noses, put them together as against us.  How many are they, even man to a man?  And do we allow that group should continue to harass us even in our independent countries?  This game changed.  Mugabe should not be there.  We want someone else.  The creditor was telling me the other day that he had been told that, oh, no, your party had been in power for too long.  You must now allow another party also to take over.  Is that democracy?

Whatever interventions that the French taxpayer, through their governments, make to us are appreciated.  We're not going to lick a gift cloth in the mouth.  But this continent, with all that has happened, is still today the repository of at least 30% of the most important minerals of the world.  It is a continent of vast arable and fertile lands.  It has the youngest population of any of the continents in the world.  So it has the energy.  and the dynamism, we have seen it.  These young men who are showing so much resilience and ingenuity in crossing the Sahara, finding ways to go across with rickety boats across the Mediterranean, those energies, we want to have those energies working inside our countries.  And we're going to have those energies working in our countries if we begin to build systems that tell the young people of our country that their hopes, their opportunity are right here with us.  Migration and the movement of people is being presented in a manner which suggests that somehow it's a new phenomenon.  There's nothing new about it.  It's as old as man, the movement of people.  And it has always been linked to the same thing, the failure of where you are to provide you with an opportunity so you move somewhere else.  Those of you who are familiar with 19th century European history would know that the biggest wave of immigration in 19th century Europe, the latter part of it, came from Ireland and from Italy.  Waves upon waves, generations of Italians and the Irish people left their countries to seek the American paradise, largely because Ireland was not working.  Italy was not working.  Today, you don't hear it.  Italian young people are in Italy.  Irish young people are in Ireland.  We want young Africans to stay in Africa.  And it means that we have to get away from this mindset of dependence, this mindset about what can France do for us.  France will do whatever it needs to do for its own sake.  And when those coincide with us, ,, as the French people say.  But our main responsibility as leaders, as citizens, is what we need to do to grow our own countries. ",
