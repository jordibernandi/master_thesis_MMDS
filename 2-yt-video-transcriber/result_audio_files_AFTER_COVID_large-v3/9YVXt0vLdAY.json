And climate activists are the new rock stars.  Why?  Well, there's fireballs in Australia.  Billions of animals are dying.  There's droughts everywhere.  And the icebergs and glaciers, well, they're melting.  So, what's an unemployed actor to do about it?  Well, tweet, of course.  Tweet.  Little known fact, all of us celebrities know each other.  We're sorry, the number you have- Ah, my good friend Gail the scientist to the rescue.  And just like that, I was off to Greenland.  I've packed nothing but the essentials.  Plastic cups in case Greenland has no cups.  Plastic bags for souvenirs.  An Osmo Pocket camera to prove to the world that yes, climate change is real.  An Osmo Pocket mic so I can record lovely voiceover, like this one.  An Osmo Pocket adapter and extension rod so I can film myself.  And fresh beets because, well, who doesn't like fresh beets?  Let's do this!  Coming up on An Idiot's Guide to Climate Change. ",
