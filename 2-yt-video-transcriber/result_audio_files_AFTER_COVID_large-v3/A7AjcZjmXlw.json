            "text": "What's up YouTube, it's Young Man's Daily Red Pill.  Before we get started on this video, make sure you Let's dive into this topic guys.  It's going to be a great topic that I think we can all relate to as men, especially moving forward.  I'm going to be talking about the 80-20 rule and why I believe the 80-20 rule will now become the 90-10 rule.  Shout out to a subscriber that actually commented this in the comment section below.  With no further ado, let's dive into the 80-20 rule and why I believe it will now become the 90-10 rule after we're done with this virus.  Let's get it.  Okay, now that we're at the whiteboard, before I can explain to you the 90-10 rule, which I think will apply moving forward after this whole pandemic, I have to first explain to those of you that don't know what the 80-20 rule is in the first place.  So we're going to break that down right now.  Here I'll explain how the 80-20 rule works through these stick figures I drew.  So here we have 10 guys and we have 10 chicks right here.  And I'm going to break this down to you.  So 80% of women, these are women, they have the little dresses.  Yes, I tried to draw the dresses.  So 80%, which is 8 out of 10.  Two, three.  So I'm going to fill this in.  This is how many women, 8 out of 10, believe or are attracted to, I should say, the top 20% of men, that's it, okay?  Look at this, guys.  The vast majority of women are only attracted to the top 20% of men.  You see this?  So this leaves a significant portion, a significant amount of men that are single, that are not taken.  All right, so here we have two women that are less attracted to the 20% of men and could care less about looks, money, status, but that's still a minority of women.  That's not the vast majority of them.  And unfortunately, we have 80% of men that aren't chosen at all, okay?  80% of men that will live their lives without a significant other, without being desired by a woman, okay?  And this is the issue right here, because even these women, even these 20% of women, aren't even really attracted to the leftover 80% of men.  You can make social media for that.  Instagram, you can make the Rise and Only fans accounts.  You can make a bunch of different things.  The media, what they tell women, women can have it all.  You don't have to settle.  You don't have to settle until you're 30 years old.  That's what they tell these women.  So here we have a huge disadvantage right here in the market for men.  Especially if you're not the top 20% of men.  Now this might be you right here, but even these men don't even get the best deal possible.  Because the majority of women, 80% I would say, have these three things in common.  have debt.  It's been shown that women carry much more student loan debts than men once they leave college.  So they carry the vast majority of debt.  And if they somehow get lucky and fortunate with a man that has his stuff together, he saves them essentially.  The top 20% man will save her from this debt.  Moving along forward, most likely she will have kids from another marriage.  Previous kids from another relationship.  Alright?  Single mothers.  Single mothers.  So kids, debt.  This is just an estimate guys.  80% of them have these issues.  Alright?  Based on my experience, based on what you guys can see, based on family members, friends, this is just what I've noticed.  The third thing that they all have in common.  is weight.  Yes, weight.  Let's just say this.  She's not in good shape.  She's out of shape.  She's overweight, all right?  80% I would say are overweight, especially if she's had kids before and she's in debt and stay afloat by eating whatever is possible, going through fast food restaurants, all of these things.  She will gain weight significantly.  these 20 percent of guys are you all right?  let's just say that this man has his life together so he's uh six foot five let's say six five.  he is a six figure earner.  he's making six figure credit score alright.  so he's built up his credit and he has basically been very financially disciplined over the years.  this is the 20% man that the 80% of these women aspire to get with and they feel like they're in the same league with.  so here is what the issue is.  and the problem is because 80% of women right here because black one this real break this down because 80% of the women all of these women right here are gonna chase only the top 20% of men that have these things.  these men will end up getting with some of these women.  they will end up having long-term relationships.  they'll end up just hooking up with these women.  because you know it's easy it's easy to hook up with women that have all these issues.  80% of women have a lot of these issues.  And as a 20% man, hey, you're not going to pass up any free meal ticket, free sex.  You're not going to pass that up.  So what these men do, unfortunately, and we've all been in this position before, especially if you're a man on your purpose, you end up sleeping with a lot of these women throughout your life.  You end up hooking up with a lot of these women right here.  And there's a huge issue with this.  There's a huge issue that I'm going to break down to you.  So, once you hook up with... Once you as a man on your purpose begin to hook up with... These undesirable women, these women that have all these issues, the 80% of women that I was talking about, when she was a 20% man to do this, what happens is these female's heads begin to explode, okay?  So she starts to go crazy.  She starts to, look at this, she's getting overwhelmed.  because she doesn't understand why she keeps giving up herself to these 20% men.  She's giving herself up to the 20% man, but in return, these 20% men do not want to be with her.  They do not want to be with her, okay?  So in her mind, it's exploded.  She doesn't know what's going on, all right?  So the real issue this creates is that 80% of women are only going are now feel entitled to the 20 of men for the rest of their lives okay for the rest of their lives until they maybe hit the wall and then they start to realize listen i need to secure someone.  he doesn't have to be a 20 man anymore i just need to be in a relationship because i'm starting to get too old to be fertile anymore and my my sexual marketplace value.  By having this mentality of only wanting the 20% man, that means 80% of men that are in society right now aren't even getting second chances with women.  They're going on dates with women potentially just to pay for her meal.  And a lot of men get frustrated with this.  A lot of men are starting to say, listen, I'm not going to continue to deal with these women that these Alphas, that these Chazz, these Tyrones, these Pookie, these Rarys have dealt with.  I'm not going to deal with this majority because their heads are not all, they're not all there.  Their egos are exploding, okay?  Instead, I'm going to go my own way.  I'm going to go my own way.  I'd say that 80%, even some of these alpha men, are going their own way, all right?  Even more and more.  So why do I think that the 90-10 rule will apply to this in the future?  The 90-10 rule is definitely going to come, guys, especially after this virus.  I'm going to break it down.  I believe after this virus that 90%... of women, 90% of women, will only settle with the 10% of men simply for the fact that they need more money, they need more resources, in times of stress, in times of turmoil, in uncertainty times, times where there's a recession such as now, they're going to exclude even more men, okay, moving forward.  They're always gonna think that the grass is greener on the other side, when in fact, right in front of them, they have literally, guys, all throughout their 20s, even early 30s, 18 19 they have the 90 of men that want them.  90 guys.  can you imagine just think about this for a moment.  can you imagine as a man it's hard to imagine unless you're a celebrity 90 of women chasing after you all right.  90 of women willing to sleep with you 90 of women willing to be in a long-term committed relationship with you, or just hook up with you in general.  Can you imagine that as a man?  It's pretty astounding, you know?  You don't think about this very often, that there's a 10% man that does have this going on in his life, has his life together, and if he ends up sleeping with 90% of the women, What this does, and it creates a huge issue, 90% of women walk around feeling entitled to that 10% man, even though he's not gonna settle down.  He's out, he's gonna go his own way.  So a lot of men have checked out of this entirely, and I don't blame them.  It's just simply ridiculous.  And I feel like after the coronavirus, more people are gonna lose their jobs.  The market's taking a hit, so we're gonna see people lose some of their investments.  Eventually, obviously, we'll get out of these times of trouble and these times of uncertainty.  But right now, I'd say that, yes, even that extra 10%, it used to be 20% of men, cut that in half, it's going to be only 10% of men that are going to be sleeping with 90% of the women.  All right?  And what's a 10% man?  Looks money status, what I said before.  So what can you do about this as a man that maybe is the 90% man, which is most likely just all of us?  What can we do about this type of situation?  How can we improve our situation?  We can invest.  All right.  yourself invest in you.  you investing in yourself is the greatest return you will have on your life if you truly believe that you have a skill in something if you're passionate about something and you want to change your circumstances change your life.  you invest in yourself.  you read.  you invest in books to help you grow your knowledge in a certain topic in certain areas of your life.  you invest in mentors that can guide you in the right steps.  you invest in a brokerage experience account, an index fund, whatever it is.  All right.  So I want you guys to take this understanding, understand that yes, while 90% of women are seeking that 10% man, unfortunately, and I believe that that will be the continuing trend after this virus.  We as men have the ability to say, listen, I know what it is.  I know, I understand that women love to chase after the 10% man, especially if she's already slept with a 10% man.  It puts you at a deficit, all right?  But what won't put you at a deficit is when you invest in yourself, all right?  You can never let yourself down.  You can only learn from your experiences by investing in yourself so you can make the right steps moving forward.  And you yourself will understand this later on in life.  It might not be immediate gratification, but over time, over a long period of time, investing in yourself will have the best return, especially better than putting your trust in a human.  I'm not just talking about women.  Putting your investments in humans in general were not perfect.  So you believe in yourself, trust in yourself, and believe that you can do whatever it is that you put your mind to.  And stay focused.  Continue to take the red pill.  Continue to go your own way, guys.  I hope you use this to encourage yourself and just understand that the sexual marketplace is a little bit out of whack right now, especially during times of crisis.  You have to invest in yourself and you have it in you to do that because we have all this downtime.  You can start an online business.  You can create different streams of revenue while you're at home.  You can read up on it.  So when doors start opening up, you can become the greatest version of yourself.  And it all starts with your mindset.  It all starts with you, alright?  I want you guys to understand that.  Don't be discouraged though.  Just wanted to break this down for you guys.  A subscriber brought it up in one of my last videos.  And I thought it was a great topic for discussion.  But you can change your circumstances by investing in yourself.  You can actually make yourself a 10% man.  You have to believe it first and you have to achieve it.  You have to go after that every single day, alright?  There's no days off.  You have to grind.  You have to think that, listen, I'm the best man.  I am the prize.  She has to come to me.  Alright?  So I want you guys to understand that.  Understand your value.  That was basically the whole point of this video.  I wanted to just let you know to invest in yourself over anything else.  You yourself can't let yourself down unless you give up.  But it's all up to you.  It's all up to your mental, your mentality.  Keep your head up guys.  Continue to go your own way.  Love you all.  Stay blessed.  Let me know how you like the whiteboard additions in my videos.  It's pretty entertaining.  It's pretty cool actually.  I enjoy doing this.  Alright, love you all.  Stay blessed. ",
