I was poking around some of their videos when I noticed that they occasionally reference a checklist, stuff like, this falls under critical thinking check number five, or whatever.  So I went back to the beginning of their playlist, and sure enough, they have a number of what they call critical thinking checks.  So I'll start with number one.  Critical thinking check number one is check scripture. ",

Evolution is a discovery that has been in the works for a few thousand years, but our modern understanding of it that AIG so adamantly rejects comes into being with Darwin in the late 1800s.  So when presented with a scientific idea that is fairly modern, can it really be called critical thinking to turn to a book that was written about twenty five hundred to three thousand years ago to see what it has to say on the matter?  Like, sure, if Genesis was actually passed down to us by God, then you couldn't say that it would be wrong on the subject.  God should know after all.  But in order to start with the Bible, you are assuming the conclusion that the Bible is actually correct.  It doesn't work like that.  If the Bible is correct, then an unbiased examination of the facts and data will show the Bible to be correct.

The old money is still good, but is gradually taken out of circulation in favor of the new money.  So using old money as the grounds for comparison to find out if a new bill is real or fake will lead us to the conclusion that all new money is fake, which is actually kind of an apt analogy here.  The Bible is the old money representing knowledge that the authors of the Bible had access to at the time.  Compare our new knowledge to that old knowledge.

And the vast majority of them are so vague that they could basically be made to fit almost anyone.  And all of that is ignoring the fact that the authors of the New Testament, where most of the prophecies are fulfilled, were well aware of these prophecies.  And since they very obviously changed details of their stories to fit certain narratives, with Mark writing to a Jewish community that was devastated by the destruction of the temple in 70 CE, Matthew writing to a Jewish community that was having issues with the contemporary Jewish leadership, and Luke writing to the Gentiles, it stands to reason that some of the details that got changed were the ones that would make Jesus fit in with certain prophecies that would make their case stronger.  The fact that Matthew, in particular, often went out of his way to fulfill prophecies in sometimes downright absurd ways is evidence of this.  Do his promises play out in our personal lives, though?  Now, I know I'll get no true Scotsman on this one by the fundamentalists, but there are plenty of verses in the Bible that talk about how if you seek God, he will reveal himself to you.  I lost my faith as part of an activity that I was undergoing with the explicit purpose of seeking God and strengthening my faith.  God did not reveal himself to me when I was seeking him, and I was seeking him with all my heart.  Though I know you only have my word to go on here, so the response will be that I wasn't really seeking him with all my heart.  All I can do here is assure you that I was sincere in my efforts and God did not reveal himself to me, which led me to my loss of faith because God didn't keep his promise.  I also got a much better job not too long after I lost my faith.  God promises prosperity to those that serve him.  And yet it was after I stopped serving him when my life took a drastic turn for the better.  And here I'm not talking about better in the sense that I'm having more fun doing things that Christians aren't allowed to do.  I'm talking about just the basics of being able to provide for my family.  God will provide.  But when I stop tithing is when the provisions improve for me. ",

Then God killed a guy and his wife for keeping a bit of the profit of the sale of their land to themselves.  This is New Testament God here.  He up and killed a dude because he didn't give enough money to the socialist commune, then killed his wife for the same thing a few hours later.  It seems that even in the New Testament, God is willing to put people to death to prove a point.  But interestingly, in the Pentecostal church I used to attend, when the pastor did a seven-week sermon series on why you need to give more money to the church, this story never once came up.

This was on my RTX 3080 unboxing video, which if you haven't watched yet because you didn't subscribe to an atheist anti-creationist channel for tech junk, I'd actually still recommend watching it.  I had a lot of fun making it.  Just do me a favor, though, and don't actually take any of the advice that I give.  And yeah, countering creationist nonsense gave me the ability to transition back and forth between fact and fiction pretty well.  Thanks for watching.  Special thanks, as always, to my patrons, Lynn Dobbs, Mark McManus, What Jesus and all the rest who are the truth.  that demonstrates the truthiness of my channel.  If you'd like my channel to just be true because it is, you can join us on Patreon for as little as a dollar per week over at patreon.com slash vice rhino.
