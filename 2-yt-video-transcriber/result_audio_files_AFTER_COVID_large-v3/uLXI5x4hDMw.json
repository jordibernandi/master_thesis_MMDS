Turkish people don't talk about Armenia for the most part like maybe even with like the maybe with the Azerbaijan conflict.  they they do but that's not a thing like.  First of all, yes, in schools, the Armenian genocide is taught as though it did not happen.  They teach it as a forced migration.  They say that a lot of cruelty did occur, but it was a consequence of the geopolitical struggle at the time, World War I, blah, blah, blah.  That's the way they teach it in schools.  So they do deny it.  but turkish people as a whole don't like have a a um like they don't think about armenia in the same way that they think about greece for example.  like some some um some turkish people will say like oh yeah greek like they do do memes about how you know they push the greeks into the water that sort of thing but they never fucking talk about armenians in that same way.  ever like ever ever ever.  Native America is basically for the U S. I think, yeah, it's, that's pretty good.  Yeah.  That's a pretty, yeah, I would say it's kind of like that.  Yeah.  In, in the United States, they talk about it a lot because Armenians in the United States have, uh, have influence and, uh, have the capability of like, uh, putting this conversation in the forefront.  I understand why, obviously.  And that's why there's always like back and forth here.  This is just straight up false.  At least nowadays it is.  Social media is full of anti-Armenian Turkish nationalists.  Probably, that's why I said it's probably as a consequence of the Azerbaijan Karabakh situation.  That's probably why.  But usually, before that, I never fucking heard about... It's not even something they consider.  They're like, yeah, it didn't happen.  Who cares?  Blah, blah, blah.  That's more so the take.  It's not something that most... It's not something that most Turkish people think about or consider at all.  It is very similar to... It is very similar to how some Americans just refuse to acknowledge indigenous genocide.  You know what I mean?  It's not even an afterthought.  Kurds is entirely different.  They... Do Americans not know that Azerbaijan is a country?  No, they're making fun of me.  They call me Azerbaijan, Azzan, that sort of thing.  No, they do know that Azerbaijan is a country. ",

Alevi.  That was a huge... That was a huge problem.  The treatment of Sunnis... Not the treatment of Sunnis.  Sunnis and their mistreatment and even murder of Alevis was a huge deal in the 90s.  Today's Syrians and Assyrians are called Assyrians without any relation.  I don't know.  But the reason they ask is that the Turks killed them or something.  Do they ever talk about this?  Hasan, super unrelated question, but Turkish is your first language, right?  Do you think and dream in Turkish and English?  When I'm in Turkey, I dream in Turkish and speak and think in Turkish.  Turkey is a Sunni majority, yes.  When I'm in America or when I'm in an English-speaking country, I start dreaming and thinking and everything else in English. ",
