All links can be found in the description or on my website, TelltaleAtheist.com.  So the first article I wanted to take a look at tonight is called Trump World Favorite Persuader.  Scott Adams Sees Satanic Coincidences in Biden Campaign.  This is by Right Wing Watch.  And they actually, I don't, they attached a Scott Adams video to this article.  So I went through the video and gave it a watch.  If you guys don't know who Scott Adams is, he wrote the Dilbert comics.  He invented Dilbert.  And I really enjoyed Dilbert when I was younger.  I loved reading those comic strips.  I had, like, books of the comics when I was little, and I'd sit there in my room and read them.  So it's really disappointing to me that this guy, Scott Adams, has gone so completely over the deep end.  He's a member of Mensa, and he is... fucking crazy.  So let's watch this clip of Scott Adams saying some really interesting stuff. ",

The hard part is respecting people's human rights while trying to deprogram them.
