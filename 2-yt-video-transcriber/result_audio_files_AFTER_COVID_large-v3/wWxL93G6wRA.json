            "text": "This is our culture.  What's the next thing?  Teachers.  Teachers.  Remember your teacher used to come to school, she had a big old nice, modestly dressed, big old dress on.  Hi students.  Anybody hear what these teachers are doing now?  They doing monkey double back flips all over their students.  crazy amount of what's happening.  a lot of them.  this is a teacher.  by the way this popular meme is a liberal professor.  she's a teacher.  okay do you realize?  when you send your kid to the public school indoctrination camp that's what I call it.  93 percent of their primary school teachers are female.  93 percent.  from kindergarten to sixth grade 93 percent.  you're the male authority figure.  God forbid you don't have to go through a custody battle.  You're remaining with your wife.  But you send them to school, 93% of the people that they're gonna get in contact to encounter are women.  Today's modern teacher are young women, like this.  They've been trained in the public school indoctrination camp themselves about how to make kids the victim.  They're not teaching arithmetic, they're teaching victim studies.  Your kid comes back fired up.  Oh, my teacher says she don't like Trump.  I'm like, why is she talking to you about Trump?  How did that conversation come up with your fifth grade teacher?  Has no place in the school, but that's what they're doing.  When they get to high school, the chances get a little bit better.  76% of the teachers that they're gonna be around are female, 76%.  More Women exposed to women, more women exposed to socialism, Marxism, so you have less of a chance.  By the time they get to college, 31% of the college professors are female.  So less focus on academic studies.  If you look at the test results of kids, they're not performing very well.  There's no emphasis in that.  There's really no need for it anymore.  You can make money without a college education for the most part.  But in regards to the socialism that is going on in these universities, the gaslighting of the kids, talking about issues related to social justice, which is social division, it's prominent.  How many men are in here fighting for these kids?  You've been at work all day.  Your kid's been on that screen way more than they've seen you.  I wanna have children, coach.  I'm just telling you what you about to come against, okay?  You gotta be willing to be able to be the dominant over all of these things.  If you're not, I'm gonna just say good luck.  Good luck.  Not only that, your co-parent selection skills, your mate selection skills gonna have to be perfect.  In these, what do they call it, coronavirus?  This coronavirus.  The teachers in Los Angeles Unified School District, their union, decided when they said it was safe to open the schools, they said, well, as a union, we don't want to return to school until you meet our demands.  You think they would have said, we would like more fathers to be present, we would like the kids to have better exposure to books?  You think they would have said, we want kids to be able to have a great learning environment when they leave this?  You know what they said they wanted as a list of demands?  We want to defund the police.  We want increased taxes on the wealthy.  We want implementation of Medicare for all.  This is what they're focused on.  They're not focused on your kid.  They're focused on indoctrinating your kid.  Where's your authority gonna come in there?  Some teacher said we should just get rid of history altogether.  Guys, if you know anything about history, All right, the people who lack knowledge of history are normally doomed to repeat it.  They are covering up their misdeeds.  They're hiding things.  This is what you have to deal with in the school.  So again, I volunteered at my kid's school to be able to see them more.  I saw nothing but women.  The noon aide was a woman.  The lunch ladies, women.  Teacher's assistants, women.  PTA board member, all of them were women except for me.  Special ed, et cetera, et cetera.  So, you think you're just gonna go to work and leave your kid at the public school indoctrination camp and all is well?  No, they're creating more division in order to subvert your authority.  You have to be able to counteract that.  Who's the next person you're going to leave them over to?  Oh, there she is.  Mom.  Who grew up with a mother that was a stay-at-home mom?  Look at that.  That's more than I would have thought.  That's more than I would have thought.  See, the myth of single motherhood has been exposed.  I gave you the statistics already.  Kids are failing in that dynamic.  It is a recipe for disaster. ",
