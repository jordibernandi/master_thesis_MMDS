So I have a few minutes real quick and I wanted to make this video about and talk about how our little boys are under attack in this country.  I talk about, in my past videos, how our American men are under attack by the left in this country.  The left, these progressives, they hate men.  Men are under attack, our American men.  And who do they detest more than our American men?  Our little boys in this country.  Little boys are despised and detested by the left in this country.  And I'm going to tell y'all a couple of stories that y'all probably heard of, but I want to give my opinion.  The most recent is a little boy goes to the mall.  He's, you know, kindergarten age, my son's age, to see Santa Claus and to tell Santa what he wants for Christmas.  You know, we all as kids probably did this.  I know I did.  And we looked forward to it.  And this Soy Boy Santa Claus tells this little boy when he says, I want a gun for Christmas.  No, you cannot have a gun.  I'm not bringing you a gun.  Well, the mom clarifies, Santa, no, it's not a real gun.  He wants a Nerf gun.  That's what he really wants for Christmas.  Santa says, absolutely not.  I'm not bringing you a Nerf gun.  No guns, no toy guns, no guns at all.  Okay.  You need to pick something else.  Maybe some Legos, maybe a bike.  Well, this whole ordeal was filmed, thank goodness.  The family posted it on social media.  There was an outrage and an outpouring of love to this family, to this little boy.  I think last night on Newsmax, they featured the family and sent the little boy a Nerf gun for him to open on camera.  He was so excited.  I think his father is a law enforcement officer and an NRA member or something like that.  I can't remember what it was, but definitely pro-Second Amendment father.  And, you know, the family was just so upset by the whole ordeal.  And I would have been too.  I certainly wouldn't have handled it as calmly as the mother did.  I give her so much respect for the way she handled it.  I would have... put that asshole in his place because I have zero tolerance for soy boys, feminists, crazy liberals.  I will definitely put them in their place because I have just, you know, no tolerance for them.  I cannot stand the way they act and the things they stand for.  They make me sick.  You know, I bet you if that little boy would have said, you know, Santa, I want makeup for Christmas.  You know, Santa probably would have responded, Little boy, you're going to wake up knee deep in eyeshadow.  Or if the little boy would have asked, you know, I want to be a girl for Christmas.  Can you bring me some hormones?  Santa would have been like, yeah, I'll bring you some estrogen.  It'll be in your stocking Christmas morning.  You know, the left, their attack on little boys, they hate masculinity.  They hate anything that's natural and normal.  and the way that we're naturally made and supposed to be.  um the only time they care about little boys is when they want to be girls.  they're trying to turn our little boys into these feminized um sweet soft-spoken um little girls and it's like they're trying to turn little girls into masculine little boys that are dominant and loud and ignorant.  It's like they're just trying to ruin humanity altogether by... switching the genders and apparently there's more than two genders according to them.  You know, they hate science.  They hate anything that's natural and normal.  But anyway, I'm glad that story ended well.  I'm going to make sure that my son gets another Nerf gun this Christmas.  I want to support Nerf.  The CEO even came out and said that they're going to send that little boy some Nerf guns.  um the the ceo of nerf is apparently pro-second amendment which i love.  i respect.  so i think every little boy should get a nerf gun this christmas.  if i could afford it i would buy every single one of them one.  but uh our little boys need to be protected they need to be respected and we need to build them up.  we cannot allow the left to destroy them and make them feel bad um for being normal and natural you know.  so The left pretends to care for women, but they really don't.  They pretend to care for little girls, but they really don't.  They really don't.  They also do that to black Americans.  They treat women and black Americans like they're pets.  It's like they use them as a stepping stone to get what they want.  And when they get what they want politically, they toss us aside and they don't care about us.  It reflects in their policies, it always has.  Another story is recently down here in Louisiana, a little boy, the same age, kindergarten age, was suspended from school and kicked out.  all because during a Zoom meeting, his teacher saw his older brother's BB gun behind the door.  It was a BB gun.  It actually wasn't the little boys.  It was his older brothers.  And when the family tried to explain that, the school did not care.  They suspended him anyway.  And, you know, this kind of stuff cannot be tolerated.  Little boys play with BB guns, just like little girls may play with dolls and things like that.  You know, when I was a little girl, I was a huge tomboy.  I used to love to hunt and fish and play with BB guns and stuff.  I was always outside by the canal and getting dirty.  I played sports.  But, you know, most little girls don't like to get dirty.  They like to play with dolls.  That's natural.  There's nothing wrong with that.  Just like little boys are masculine.  They have testosterone.  They're supposed to be just the way they are.  And, you know, we need to stop.  We need to not tolerate the way they're treating our little boys.  Just like we need to not tolerate the way they disrespect and dishonor our American men.  But I just wanted to rant about that in this video.  So like the video if you did, subscribe if you want to hear more, and I'll see y'all back on my next video. ",
