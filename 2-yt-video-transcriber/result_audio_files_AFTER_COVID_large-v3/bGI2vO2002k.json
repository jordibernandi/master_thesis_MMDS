            "text": "My video for May the 13th, 2020 is video number 3,453.  The title is demons are trying hard to stop an awakening.  All right.  I do realize that some may not like that first word in the title, but whatever word you use for these liars, they have twisted everything in human society for eons.  I know, I keep saying that.  And more people are waking up to that reality daily.  The internet is to be thanked since it connects people and makes info more easily available than ever before.  Yes, it was created to spy on us.  Many have told me that, and I am convinced it is true.  Why?  Because I am waking up.  I am seeing things in a very different light than was even possible when I was younger.  My own quest for the kingdom of heaven on earth has been the driving force propelling me to look at things in a new light.  Awakening is, after all, learning to see outside the box of mind control in which humanity has been enslaved.  Are you waking up too?  Many of us are.  As George Carlin said, it's a big club and you ain't in it.  Internet fact checkers try to stop the truth.  Oh, I chuckle once again because people are waking up.  They're trying to block so many things.  I have people say, watch this before it gets taken down.  But people are saving things on their computer and sharing them after they're taken down.  You try to find something that somebody sends you by looking online and you can't find it.  And yet there it is.  Somebody has it online on their computer.  The system is bigger than can be controlled.  Obviously.  Is that true?  It seems obvious to me, but is it really true?  There's lots of things throughout my life that I thought were true.  I really thought the Bible was the word of God.  I now realize that it contains words from God, and so do a lot of other things, as I've said in many videos.  But it's certainly not the infallible word of God, as I was taught.  It was an indoctrination vehicle to get us to think That God was jealous and insecure to get us to think that our creator had an agenda that he could create good and evil.  Wait a minute.  A loving God does not create evil.  But a being with a false agenda, a demon, a fallen angel, does evil.  create evil, twists everything and turns it around backwards, puts it on its head.  Everything is inside out and upside down, as I've said over and over again in my videos.  We need to wake up and we are waking up, which is why there is so much of an attempt by our controllers.  They're not leaders, they're controllers.  They want to control the information and they want to control us.  Why do you think we are in this lockdown?  It's not just because they want to arrest the demons.  It's because they've mind controlled a whole lot of people to create mass murders.  And supposedly that's why the Donald is saying we, you know, we do need to avoid big crowds so that the, mind-controlled patsies that want to do mass murders can't go into a ball stadium, for example, and wipe out thousands of people in one shot.  Now, I don't know if that's really something that's planned or not.  I imagine it probably is because I know from the Georgia Guidestones that the plan to reduce the world's population to a manageable half a billion people.  Yeah, 500 million people is all they want on this planet.  And there's already seven to eight billion people, according to some people's numbers.  I don't go around counting them and I couldn't count that high anyway, not by ones anyway, not even by hundreds.  But in any case, folks, you get my point.  We have been lied to about everything.  An omnipotent God could not possibly be jealous.  Now I believe that God is an absentee God in our current world, but maybe that God is waking up too, which is why I'm praying for God to take action.  God is not Donald Trump, but as Donald Trump, on God's side.  That is, let's put it another way, is Donald Trump trying to expose the lies and the corruption of the deep state?  I think there's a possibility that that's true, although there's other things that make me scratch my head in wonderment.  What the heck is going on here?  This is a very crazy agenda that's unfolding before us.  They're trying to lock us down.  And some say they want to keep us locked down until the election so that Donald Trump doesn't get in.  But what's the alternative?  Biden?  He's an idiot, folks.  He's got dementia.  They don't want him to actually be in charge of anything.  And by they, again, I'm saying the demonic element, the fallen angel element.  It's a dark agenda.  It's a big club, as George Carlin said, and you ain't in it.  Neither am I. It's the club of the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds.  It's the club of the Zuckerbergs.  Oh, God.  Isn't it awful?  I mean, the guy that's the head of all this internet thing now, Bill Gates, of course, Bill Gates, and this other guy that was on Trump's thing of peering side by side with him.  These are dark forces, folks.  Wake up.  And we are waking up.  Even some of the people that I talk to here in the apartment complex, are starting to get it.  They're starting to see.  At first, when you start spilling a little bit here and a little bit there, they look at you like you're nuts.  But after a while, after they see all of the insanity going on around them, people are beginning to say, wait a minute, maybe I have been lied to.  And there's a question that forms in the mind.  And a little bit of an opening, it cracks open just a little bit so that the light starts penetrating into the darkness of ignorance.  It's not darkness like, like in a cave where you turn off all the lights and you can't see your hand in front of your face.  That's not the kind of darkness.  It's a mental darkness where you can't see the truth, where you can't see through the maze of lies and contradictions.  But people are starting to see through those contradictions, are starting to awaken to a reality that something is wrong.  Now, I know I have people say, but it's just an illusion.  Why are you trying to fix the illusion?  It's always going to be an illusion.  Well, we have been deluded, but it's not an illusion.  We really are here.  And even if our bodies are made of atoms, which are mostly empty space, they are still solid from our experiential point of view.  And it's the experiential point of view that matters in the unfolding of life itself.  We are waking up.  We are seeing things.  We are questioning as never before.  This is a good thing.  I applaud it.  And I hope that my prayers for God are being answered, that God will finally, after eons, take responsibility for creation.  Thank you for listening.  and namaste.  Oh, I'm going to continue, even though I thought I was.  The real reason that we can't have the 10 commandments in a courthouse.  You cannot post thou shalt not steal, thou shalt not commit adultery, and thou shalt not lie in a building full of lawyers, judges, and politicians.  It creates a hostile work environment.  That's the George Carlin quote.  And I'm adding it at the end of this video.  I forgot to say it earlier.  Again, namaste. ",
