            "text": "Hi there, it's your girl Z from transvoicelessons.com and in this video we're going to listen to the evolution of my voice from masculine to feminine.  It happened over the course of about five and a half years and I've got all of it well documented with audio files.  So we're going to start from about five years ago and we're going to listen forward to now.  now a bit of backstory about me.  um i started playing music in 2004. i got super into music.  around like 2006.  2008 i was studying a lot of music composition and sound design and i started getting into music theory.  at that time acoustics was like absolutely fascinating and riveting to me so i was focusing a lot of my attention on music and acoustics.  i ended up entering university and studying music composition in 2010.  I graduated in 2015 and that is when I began my transition and I started changing my voice.  All right, so the first one that we're going to listen to is from March 25th, 2015.  This is completely my dead voice.  There is no alteration to this.  I hadn't even begun practicing voice.  I wasn't even out yet.  I wasn't even out to myself.  So let's go ahead and take a listen to that. ",

They don't quite make enough vocal fold contact.  And then as they're over-abducting, they actually bring their false folds in.  So you end up with this kind of like... You end up with that kind of sound.  So I was doing that my first attempt. ",

Now, around this time, July 30th, 2015, I was getting ready to start touring a lot with my band.  We were about to go on the road for three months that winter, so we started practicing, my band picked up, and we started doing a lot of that stuff.  In that timeframe there, I kind of gave up on voice.  I didn't really give up, but I just didn't know where to go, right?  So there's actually a really big jump from the last file to this next one.  So we jumped forward about 10 months or so.  In that time, I sort of worked further on my transition.  I still did not have hormones yet.  I had toured and did a lot of different music stuff at that time. ",
