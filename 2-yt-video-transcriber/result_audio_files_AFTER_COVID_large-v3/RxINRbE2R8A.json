            "text": "Here we see the President and the first bitch.  Hey, hey, slow down you bitch, let me catch up.  Here we see President Clinton looking for something, anything to hug besides his wife.  This week in South Africa, Winnie Mandela was removed from the new government by her husband, President Nelson Mandela.  A curious Bill Clinton later called Mr.  Mandela to find out how exactly you go about doing something like that.  Gosh, Hillary looks pretty in this photo here, doesn't she?  I never realized she was such a looker until I see her here in this picture.  A frightening moment this week for First Lady Hillary Clinton.  Her plane en route to the former Soviet Union was forced to make an emergency landing when it was discovered that a frayed wire in the engine was causing serious malfunctions.  The President was said to be furious and demanded an immediate investigation of what went wrong with Operation Frayed Wire.  First Lady Hillary Clinton has been out of the country this week visiting the remote region of Siberia.  Said the president, quote, when the cat's away, the mice... Oh, who am I kidding?  The mouse screws plenty of women even when the cat's right here.  At the White House this week, President Clinton officially came out against same-sex marriages.  What's more, the president said he is not too crazy about opposite-sex marriages either.  Astronaut Shannon Lucid, back on Earth after a record six months in space, was welcomed home Tuesday with a phone call from President Clinton.  Said to President, quote, this is just the beginning.  One day we'll be able to send an American into space indefinitely, and I hope it's a woman.  Speaking in Australia this week about the problems of being America's first lady, Hillary Clinton joked, quote, perhaps I'll walk around with a bag over my head when I come out into public and have no opinions and never express them publicly or privately.  To which the president replied, yes, yes, oh God, yes.  As new questions arise about Hillary Clinton's role in Whitewater, the President appears to be distancing himself from the First Lady.  Earlier today in his weekly radio address, the President insisted, hey, I sleep with hundreds of girls, I can't vouch for all of them, you know?  Though more indictments are likely in the Whitewater investigation, President Clinton is still refusing to say whether he will pardon former Whitewater associates Jim and Susan McDougal.  But when asked if he would pardon First Lady Hillary Clinton, the president was crystal clear.  Quote, she does the crime, she does the time.  Court documents made public this week, Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr told a federal judge that Hillary Clinton is now a, quote, central figure in the Whitewater criminal probe.  Reacting to the news, President Clinton called the investigation a partisan witch hunt, vowing, quote, if the First Lady is somehow convicted and has to go to jail, I will do everything in my power to wait two weeks to start dating.  With growing indications that First Lady Hillary Clinton may be indicted for her role in Whitewater, President Clinton is reportedly starting to prepare for that possibility.  Plans so far include renting a hall, hiring a band, and making a giant bathtub with margaritas.  In a unanimous verdict this week, a Santa Monica jury found O.J.  Simpson liable for the wrongful deaths of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman, awarding the plaintiff's damages of $8.5 million.  Reacting to the verdict, Simpson insisted that he has nowhere near that amount of money and that his only remaining asset is 30 pairs of Brunei Mali shoes.  The announcement of the verdict came toward the end of President Clinton's annual State of the Union address, and many observers completely overshadowed the event.  Even the president was distracted during his speech, waiting to hear exactly how much it costs to kill your wife.  Well, more O.J.  Simpson news.  On Friday, the Jews officially endorsed Bill Clinton for president, adding, quote, I'd like to help him any way I can.  To which the president replied, well, there is one thing.  An American president, Rob Reiner's new film starring Michael Douglas and Annette Bening opened in theaters last week.  Here with his review is Update movie critic and 42nd president of these United States, Bill Clinton. ",

            "text": "I guess I never thought about that, Mr.  President.  I have.  Every day of my life.  Last week, the President vetoed a Republican bill to balance the budget, and he used a pen that belonged to former President Lyndon Johnson.  Clinton has also been working his way through John F. Kennedy's vast supply of condoms.  Well, more bad news for Bill Clinton.  This week, an appellate court ruled that Paula Jones can proceed with her sexual harassment suit against the president.  Jones' suit is based on a 1991 hotel room encounter during which she alleges that then-Governor Clinton dropped his pants and exposed himself.  She is seeking $700,000 in damages, $100,000 for trauma after seeing the governor's penis, and $300,000 for each thigh.  Well, Chelsea Clinton turned 16 a few weeks ago, and apparently her father has been teaching her to drive.  Early reports say that under the president's tutelage, the first daughter has become exceptionally good at cruising for chicks.  A Connecticut hotel where Bill Clinton spent the night has donated to a charity auction a bagel the president ordered from room service but never ate.  Though potential bidders should be advised, while the president never actually ate the bagel, he did have, quote, relations with it.  Sounds delicious.  This week, President Clinton made history when he nominated Madeleine Albright to be first female secretary of state.  Responding to critics who say that she is not the best choice, the president insisted, quote, she looks a lot better after a couple of drinks.  This week in arguments before the Supreme Court, lawyers for President Clinton ask that the sexual harassment suit brought by Paula Jones be delayed until he leaves office.  According to Clinton's attorney, quote, if the president were hauled into court every time some nut accused him of sexual harassment, he'd have no time to scare up tail.  He likes scaring up the tail.  Okay.  More bad news for the president.  This week, convicted Whitewater swindler James McDougal claimed that his ex-wife, Susan McDougal, had an affair with Clinton while he was governor of Arkansas.  The president denied the charges, adding, quote, if you really knew me, you'd know that I was always faithful to Jennifer Flowers.  In a startling reversal, Kenneth Starr announced yesterday that he would not resign as Whitewater's special prosecutor and that now he intends to stay on until the investigation is completed.  This new development apparently did not trouble a confident President Clinton who still plans to resume making conjugal visits to Susan McDougal.  Yesterday, President Clinton underwent a two-hour operation to repair damage to his knee.  Suffered in a fall while visiting in Florida at the home of professional golfer Greg Norman.  Many were surprised to hear that the two were on friendly terms, since Greg Norman had once threatened that if he ever caught Clinton with his wife again, he'd smash his kneecap with a five-iron.  The White House says that surviving relatives of those who died in a 40-year-old federal study which allowed men infected with syphilis to go untreated will get an official apology from President Clinton.  According to the president, quote, if not for the sacrifices of these brave men, I would not be alive today.  Court martial proceedings are set to begin Tuesday against Air Force Lieutenant Kelly Flynn, the nation's first female B-52 pilot.  Flynn is accused of conducting an adulterous affair with a married man as well as having a brief fling with a second airman and then lying about it.  An Air Force prosecutor called her, quote, a sexual predator, while her commanding officer called her a, quote, lying sex addict.  Meanwhile, President Clinton called her, Well, the White House is an empty nest this week following Chelsea Clinton's departure to begin studies at Stanford University.  A wistful, President Clinton says that while it's difficult to see his daughter grow up, at least now he'll feel less guilty about hitting on her friends.  According to Reno, there is no evidence he misused his office to raise money, improperly allowed contributors to stay overnight at the White House, or sought contributions in exchange for political favors.  You know, it's hard for me to believe this, but for Janet Reno to send this letter, I guess it must be true.  The President's sleeping with her, too.  It's beyond comprehension, but... I'm Tom Snyder this week after Tony Danza said he thought the recent open display of affection by lesbian couple Ellen DeGeneres and Anne Heche in front of President Clinton was extremely disrespectful.  On hearing the comment, President Clinton responded, someone should tell Tony Danza to shut the hell up.  Meanwhile, President Clinton was in Akron, Ohio this week, presiding in a town meeting about race relations in America.  The president chose Akron as the site of the meeting, partly because it is the home of the Coming Together Project, an organized effort to end racism, and partly because it is the home of Suzanne Rosenberg, an old classmate from Oxford the president still has sex with.  Well, President Clinton received an early Christmas present this week, an adorable Labrador puppy.  And presidential historians say that it will be good for his image.  According to these scholars, in comparison to a male dog, the president's sex life will seem relatively normal.  A five-year-old child writes, Dear Mr.  President, When the Republicans are finished wasting taxpayer money on their whitewater witch hunt, Perhaps they can join you in your efforts to protect Medicare and the environment and to expand the earned income tax credit.  P.S.,  Paula Jones was asking for it.  Here's one from Elizabeth A. of Long Island who wrote, Dear President Clinton, Newt Gingrich is a bad, bad man.  Also, Paula Jones was asking for it.  The Supreme Court will begin hearing arguments over whether Paula Jones' sexual harassment suit against President Clinton may proceed.  Jones, who claims that while governor of Arkansas, Clinton exposed himself to her in a hotel room, says that she can accurately and precisely describe the president's genitalia.  But White House spokesman scoffed, quote, any woman who's worked in the state of Arkansas for the last 20 years could do that.  Does President Clinton have a bent penis?  Well, according to a doctor who examined him last week, the President's genitals are, quote, completely 100% normal.  It should be noted, however, that the doctor who examined him also has a bent penis.  I may color his findings a little.  As his last stop on the trip, the President met in Buenos Aires Thursday with Argentinian President Carlos Menem.  During the meeting... Clinton asked Menem to continue with economic reform and protect democratic freedom.  Menem, in turn, asked Clinton to show him his bent penis.  Tomorrow, Chinese President Zhang Zemin begins a week-long visit that could define US relations with China for years to come.  President Clinton plans to ask Zhang for several things, including human rights reform, trade expansion, and a Chinese herb said to have the power to straighten a bent penis.  this week an angry president clinton demanded the congress stop dragging its feet on something he has long championed a medical bill of rights for u.s citizens.  in all there are 10 items in the president's bill of rights running from number one a rich satisfying sex life is the foundation of good health to number 10 a straight penis is not a privilege it is a right.  Serious Indonesian accused of illegally raising millions for the Democratic Party.  Earlier this week, Secret Service logs showed that Mr.  Wong had visited the Clinton White House more than 60 times.  But on Friday, administration spokesman revealed that there are actually two John Wongs.  Furthermore, they stressed that the John Wong who visited the White House is a different man.  He isn't the fundraiser.  He's the guy who killed Vince Foster.  On Capitol Hill this week, 17 Republican congressmen formally asked the House Judiciary Committee whether there is sufficient evidence to begin impeachment proceedings against President Clinton.  In response, the president said, quote, Hey, you know who would have the answer to that question?  Vince Foster.  This weekend, veteran news anchorman David Brinkley apologized to Bill Clinton for an election night commentary in which he called the president, quote, boring and uncreative.  Admitted Brinkley, there was certainly nothing uncreative about the way you moved Vince Foster's body.  The president's a murderer.  You didn't know that? ",
