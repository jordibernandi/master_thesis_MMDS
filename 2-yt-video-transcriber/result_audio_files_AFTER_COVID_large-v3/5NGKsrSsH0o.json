You have to work on yourself to perfect your character, to perfect all of the flaws, every single day.  Until you get all the way to Hashem.  Ad Hashem.

And with your righteousness, they are lifting themselves spiritually.  You are the glory of their strength.  And when you want... Our level rise sharply just when you want.  All we have to do is to get you to want.  Once you want, nobody can stand next to us.  Because our Lord is our saviour and the holy of the nation of Israel.  He is our king.  Then you spoke of the prophecy of the prophet Samuel.  You told him, I gave strength to the hero.  I lifted the chosen one from the nation.  Who is he talking about?  King David.  Samuel was the prophet in the time of David the king.  Samuel the prophet.  The one on top of all the kings of the world.  I found, I picked David from millions, and I put my holy oil, Shemen HaMishchah, from the horn that Shmuel the prophet put on his head, eventually become the king, but not just the king in this world.  The king of Mashiach.  The kingdom, the final kingdom will come also from him.  With my holy oil, I poured on his head.  My hand is supporting him.  My arm strengthens him.  No enemies can deceive him.  And a despicable human being cannot torture him.  I am going to break all his enemies in front of him.  And I will defeat his enemies.  My strength, my faith, my support is always with him.  The Zohar in Parashat Shemot 7.  This is what the Zohar say.  It will be darkness in all the land of Egypt.  To the future to come.  This was written 2000 years ago.  There will be The wicked Jews.  When Mashiach would come, the Messiah will arrive.  There will be Jews.  The liberals.  The anti-religion.  That will join the nations to help them to fight against Mashiach.  In a final revenge against all the anti-Semites.  Don't be so surprised.  And the Zohar in Parashat Pinchas, Resh Mem Tet, this is what it says.  In those 15 days of darkness, there will be a disaster for all the leaders of the Erev Rav.  Now you understand why you have in Israel half of the government who constantly make fun at the Torah and at the rabbis and at Hashem.  If you worship Hashem and also worship society, you would be left with nothing.  You have to make a decision.  You are with me or you are against me.  Many, many Jews lost their olam haba.  From our nation.  Why are they going to keep mitzvot?  I don't know.  What is the word for them?  They don't have a share to the world to come already.  Because the damage that they made, irreversible.  There's no way to fix it. ",

He says the person that's a faker, All of these fake speakers, whatever they are, these self-help people, some Jewish, some not.  He says those people are much worse than anybody else.  Why?  Because they have disciples.  They teach people they're fake.  They teach people they're false. ",

Do it as soon as possible.  Don't let anybody else tell you, no, no, you're being fanat, you're being nothing.  You know it's right, you do it.  Forget about your upbringing, your down-bringing, your is-bringing, all that stuff is excuses, it's not going to work.  No one is going to fight for you in the bed-deen of Shamayim, no one.  Only your own actions are going to fight for you.  A person realizes that, he starts fixing his actions, she starts fixing her actions.  B'ezrat Hashem, we all start fixing our actions, but the reality is, Rabotai, I think it's more than enough for each one of us to take something out of what we've learned today, and B'ezrat Hashem, at least begin our tshuvah.
