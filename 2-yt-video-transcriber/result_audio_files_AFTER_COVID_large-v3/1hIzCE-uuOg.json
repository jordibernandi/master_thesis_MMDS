            "text": "This is why the Second Amendment crowd is so loud when people say, you don't need an AR-15.  You don't need a thousand rounds of ammunition.  In the coming weeks, you might need an AR-15 and you might need thousands of rounds of ammunition.  Hey, welcome back, guys.  Out in the woods, practicing.  Working on our aisle kicking.  Guys, you gotta be out in the woods doing this stuff.  You gotta be in your area doing this stuff.  This stuff cannot be cannot be new to you.  It has to be second nature.  You have to get out and practice.  You have to get out and train.  You have to be familiar with your tools.  All of them, everything.  You know how to put a bandaid on with your eyes closed, right?  This video is just kind of simple.  Are you prepared?  Are you prepared concept?  Just to kind of throw some things out there.  Maybe you guys aren't looking down the road.  Maybe you guys aren't thinking, look at these big old tracks.  What the heck is that?  Look like a big toe right there.  Maybe a little toe right there.  Maybe a heel.  Seven foot strides, right?  Someone else is out here doing some owl kicking.  Are you prepared, guys?  We're going to run through just a couple of little scenarios, a little bit of advice that maybe you're not prepared for.  What happens if your job goes away?  What happens if last week you were good, business was doing good?  Money's rolling in, making cash, right?  Planning vacations, spending money, all the fun stuff.  What happens if that went away?  What happens if you're told to go home, work from home, or for most of you, can't work from home, right?  The concept of working from home was never really an option for me.  Can you work from home?  You gonna go file for unemployment?  How long is that going to pay the bills?  Especially when you can't go out and get a new job and earn a new wage, right?  How do you pay the bills?  How long is the power company going to let you not pay the bills?  Even though we're in an emergency, a crisis like we are, what if this thing continues?  What if this isn't one month or two months?  What if this thing... Like it's projected in some places, what if this thing has an effect for 18 months, over a year?  Over a year of negative effect on people.  Now let's rewind.  You've gone two weeks without a paycheck.  How much food are you gonna be able to get?  How much food are you gonna be able to provide for your family?  You've gone a month without a paycheck, did you pay your mortgage?  Are they gonna kick you out?  You gonna start getting those letters even though the majority of the country is, a large number of the country is not working, right?  Got sent home due to this thing.  What if it continues to get worse?  What if it goes in the way of Italy and is just heading to the climax, no signs of stopping, right?  What happens if the power goes out?  What happens if the water goes out?  What happens if the food goes out?  Guys, most people don't have a week's worth of food in their house.  The majority of people do not have a week's worth of food in their house, statistically speaking.  Most people have about three days worth of food in their home.  Then they go shopping again, right?  Most people don't have pantries full of stuff.  Most people don't have pantries.  For many of you, you probably live on a farm or you live wherever you live.  I don't know.  Some of you guys don't.  You live in a normal house in a normal neighborhood and you never thought something like this would take place.  But now it's taking place.  What are you going to do when you start missing meals?  What are you going to do when your family starts missing meals?  You're looking at everyone and they're just looking hungry, looking at you.  Maybe you're the leader of your house, right?  Generally the male figure, right?  What are you going to do?  What is the plan?  You can't go to the store, right?  Stores generally have three days worth of food in them.  Anyway, three days and the new trucks come in and replenish it.  What happens when the shelves are empty and stay empty?  And for some of you, you might think they're not going to stay empty.  We never do that.  Never stays empty.  Guys, the ship stopped coming into port weeks ago.  Weeks ago there were reports of the ports being empty.  No ships, no containers.  All those goods, all of that stuff that comes from overseas not coming in anymore.  That happening a couple weeks ago at some point will get into the supply chain and you will feel You will feel that.  You will go into stores and they will be empty.  There will be nothing in them for a period of time, possibly for a more extended period of time than we think.  How does this affect farming and agriculture?  The people behind the scenes that feed us, that grow the goods, the food.  What happens if those people get sick and they can't farm and they can't garden and they can't provide for the masses.  and the masses who don't provide for themselves but rely on others to provide for them, what happens when all those people are now hungry and angry?  Right?  How bad could it possibly get?  We've never seen it before.  So you gotta prepare for the worst, right?  You have to prepare for people coming to take what is yours.  You have to prepare that someone hungrier than you is going to try and take from you.  We are headed back to that carnal instinct, that caveman instinct of if I can take it, I'm gonna take it because I'm hungry.  Hungry people, scared people, desperate people, that's dangerous.  That's a dangerous combination.  How many of you went out and bought a gun for the first time?  Gun sales are at a record high right now.  A lot of first time gun owners, gun buyers going out trying to get guns.  How many of you guys bought your first gun during whatever this is?  How many of you guys haven't dusted off the heater for months, if not years, because you never go to the range, right?  Oh, I know how to use it, right?  Cock back and pull the little thingy, right?  Bang, bang, bang.  You ever shot with your heart rate up?  You ever shot sucking wind?  You ever done 20, 30 pushups, jumped up, and then started shooting and moving?  You ever done any of that stuff?  Some people have.  Some people have it.  Maybe you should if you've never done it.  But we're getting to a point where it's getting a little too late for that.  Is it too late now?  I think it's getting there.  I think that if you haven't been to the range in a year, you might want to find time to go if you haven't been quarantined inside your home.  You might want to go get some rounds down range if you have the extra rounds to spare now that we're having an ammo shortage because all the people are going and buying the ammo, right?  TP and ammo.  These are concepts that you prepare for beforehand.  This is why the Second Amendment crowd is so loud when people say, you don't need an AR-15.  You don't need a thousand rounds of ammunition.  In the coming weeks, you might need an AR-15 and you might need thousands of rounds of ammunition.  Why?  Because one, you might be shooting.  Two, bullets might not be hitting the shelves again, which means as you're shooting out, they're not coming in anymore.  You can't just go down to the local Shopko and get yourself some bullets.  Pretty sure Shopko's never sold bullets.  What are you gonna do then with your grandpa's 9mm and a box of dusty ammo?  And that's all you got, right?  You got your Joe Biden double barrel shotgun.  What's the plan?  You're gonna brush up on your shooting skills in the middle of all this?  Are you in the city and can't move, right?  You can't get out because you're on lockdown?  There's no practice range inside your apartment, I'm sure of it.  Be prepared, guys.  Prepare for the worst of what could possibly take place during all this.  Really think about how bad it could truly get.  Don't stick your head in the sand and say it's going to be fine.  The government's going to take care of us.  People are not going to kick in my door to try and take what is mine.  Don't be that, don't be that person.  Don't be that fool.  There's gonna be plenty of those fools in the world who won't heed the advice, who haven't heeded the advice.  You're getting last minute advice right now.
