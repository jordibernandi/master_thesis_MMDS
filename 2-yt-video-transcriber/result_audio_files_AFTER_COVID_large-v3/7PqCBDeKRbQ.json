            "text": "In this video, we're going to talk about, you know, what charges some of the coup people might be facing.  So it's going to be kind of a short one, but stick with me folks.  I'll be with you in a minute.  Hey everybody, this is Deb with Truthfication Chronicles, and I'm going to start with this because we're going to be kind of talking about justice in this.  And this one is from Mike Boudreau, and he is an elected California sheriff.  which i think is very interesting.  he says as sheriff i will not be citing people who violate the stay-at-home order.  the reason is i must focus on true criminals.  i will not cite or arrest otherwise law-abiding citizens when i'm being ordered by sacramento to release child abusers burglars and other criminals from jail.  And since we're going to be talking about justice here in a minute, one of the things that I wanted to point out here is when we're dealing with the stay at home order, we've talked about this before in my videos, they really can't say you have to stay home because that's depriving us of liberty without due process.  And it's simply not allowed, not even in an emergency.  They can recommend that you stay home, but they can't require it.  It just doesn't fit with our constitutional rights.  So I think this sheriff is well within his own rights to be able to do this because he's right that his focus really needs to be on the true criminals.  And, you know, he's being ordered by Sacramento to release these kinds of people and lock up law-abiding citizens.  I think any law enforcement officer who can't see the injustice in that kind of idea has something wrong.  and they shouldn't be in law enforcement.  So I hope there's a lot of sheriffs out there like this who are seeing through what's really going on.  I just can't imagine law enforcement officers that are decent and Honestly trying to do what's best for the people would not see it the same way as this man.  So I wanted to share that with you.  And then I know you've probably already heard about this because it was a couple days ago.  It was on the 18th and I'm recording this on the 20th.  But I wanted to point out this one part of what he says here.  So listen carefully. ",

            "text": "so he can't legitimately say who is being investigated but it's pretty obvious to everybody who the players are at least the main ones.  i think by now everybody has a good idea of who they are.  well greg rabini here who is a kind of a a fairly well-known guy who comments on things And he did this thread here of what he thinks the crimes are that these people could be investigated for.  So according to Greg Rubini, John Brennan will get the death penalty.  And the charges against him are three counts of conspiracy to overthrow the government, one count of conspiracy to commit treason.  Not just Brennan.  List below.  Info from a source close to Durham prosecutors.  And yep, that's what Brennan looks like.  I'm sure he's not going to be very happy about this.  I hope he's got a lawyer.  Well, I'm sure he does by now.  Well, number two, while you read this thread, remember that William Barr has reinstated the death penalty for federal crimes in July 2019.  You remember that, right?  That was interesting.  Okay, other charges against Brennan, three counts of lying to Congress, two counts of lying to investigators.  Number four, charges against James Clapper, three counts of conspiracy to overthrow the government, two counts of lying to Congress.  James Comey, three counts of conspiracy to overthrow the government, six counts of perjury, four counts of obstruction of justice, four counts of falsifying government documents.  Number six, Andrew McCabe.  Three counts of conspiracy to overthrow the government, two counts of perjury, three counts of lying to Congress, one count of falsifying government documents.  They're adding up, aren't they?  Yep.  Number seven, Peter Strzok.  Three counts of conspiracy to overthrow the government, four counts of perjury, three counts of falsifying government documents.  Number eight, Sally Yates.  Three counts of conspiracy to overthrow the government, three counts of obstruction of justice.  Loretta Lynch, three counts of conspiracy to overthrow the government, two counts of lying to Congress.  Number 10, Lisa Page, three counts of conspiracy to overthrow the government, three counts of perjury, one count of obstruction of justice.  Bruce Ohr, three counts of conspiracy to overthrow the government, one count of falsifying government documents.  Number 12, he says, sounds good to me, and this is just a provisional list.  High probability other crimes will be charged to the above thugs, and more names to be added to the list.  And he says, please retweet number one.  And then he says, note the source of the info is a good source connected with the Durham prosecutors.  I cannot say more at the moment.  A few days ago, Trump hinted at 50 years sentences.  An indirect hint?  Trump certainly knows, and he said a lot of people are going to pay.  Watch. ",

And then he goes on, he says, certainly three counts of conspiracy to overthrow the government guarantee 50 years of jail or more.  Think Comey, Clapper, McCabe, Strzok, Yates, etc.  See above.  Trump also said they tried to overthrow a duly elected president, which is exactly what the conspiracy to overthrow the government means, the above mentioned charges.  Another coincidence?  Watch. ",

            "text": "Yep, he's right.  So we have a long list of people that will be charged with three counts each of conspiracy to overthrow the government.  Brennan, Clapper, Comey, McCabe, Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, Sally Yates, Loretta Lynch, Bruce Ohr.  How many years of jail time each?  From what I've read, that makes 20 years for each count of conspiracy to overthrow the government, 60 years in jail each, plus the additional charges.  Let's say 70 or 80 years of jail time for each of them.  That's fine for me.  But first, I want to watch the trials broadcast live.  Me too.  John Brennan is a different case because he has also the additional count of conspiracy to commit treason.  This means death penalty for sure.  Now I'm not sure why the others are not.  conspiracy to commit treason and John Brennan would be considered as that but don't know.  I kind of think all of them are fitting in the treason category right now.  so it was kind of interesting reading through some of the comments that they have here and it's just yeah this.  this is an interesting thing because we've talked about this before.  Media Matters is posting his tweets.  so Keep people like that in mind because they're kind of on the front lines and yeah, Media Matters goes right after them.  You know that.  And they make lists of people.  Like I said, they had that list of the Q followers who were running for office.  So they keep hit lists.  It's really sad, and that's what they are.  So, yeah, conspiracy to commit treason requires at least one other co-conspirator.  That's a good point.  You gotta have that.  And see, this is what I'm feeling like.  Only Brennan gets charged with treason.  I think several more of them deserve it as well.  I sure hope your info is on the money.  So... We'll see.  We'll see what happens.  And just a reminder about the Barr comment where he said that he hasn't seen any evidence as of now, as of today, when he was doing that interview to charge either Obama or Biden with anything.  He hasn't seen the evidence yet.  Let's just put it that way because I'm pretty sure there was a plan out there to take out Trump.  And that's what I really think probably was going on after that January 5th meeting.  I think somewhere along the line, they were hoping to take him out before he could take office for the inauguration.  And that's why I think Sally Yates waited so long.  because she didn't put that memo out until the day of the inauguration.  In fact, after he had actually taken the oath of office.  I think they had something planned that was going to take Trump out.  At least they hoped it would.  And thank God that didn't happen.  So, you know, it's really, really good.  So this is why Guantanamo Bay has been expanded, likely.  But I think there's going to be a whole lot more people than this.  The conspiracy went much, much further.  And there are going to be other people.  As to when the first person is going to be arrested, I don't know.  But I do know that it's going to really... kind of surprise everybody.  And I know a lot of people saying that Q said it was going to shock the world.  That's not exactly what he said.  But just having someone arrested for this is going to be a huge thing.  One Anon on the research board said that maybe the reason it's going to shock people is because it's going to be moved to a military court instead of the regular criminal court.  Because we've already seen with the whole Flynn thing that I'm not sure we can trust the court system.  So it very well could be because of the nature of these crimes, I would think this would move it automatically to the military court, overthrowing a government.  You know, it really does kind of move you into that category.  At least I would think so.  But then again, I'm not a lawyer, so I don't know for sure.  Anyway, that's what I've got for you on this one.  I'll leave all the links down below and you can go through it yourself and you can share it.  I know some of you are saying, well, nobody's going to get arrested.  Nothing's going to happen.  The indictments are going to happen.  Some people will go to jail.  They will.  It's just who and how long.  that's going to be questionable and whether they're going to be somebody who is accused of treason or not.  That's kind of iffy too.  I'm not sure who all, but there will be some who are accused of treason.  I just know that's going to happen because I've been watching the escalation of it over the last couple of years.  And I see it getting much closer all the time.  So, you know, I know there's a lot of naysayers out there, but I really do see how it's progressing.  And I can see how it's going to come together.  It is already coming together in a big way.  And there's going to be a lot more declassified documents released in the near future.  So hang on, folks.  We've got a fun ride ahead.  Grab your popcorn, everybody, because it's getting good.  So that's what I've got for you on this one.  I want to thank you for stopping by and I'll see you all later. ",
