            "text": "G'day guys, how you doing?  Hey, I'm back with another video.  Yep, it's been a little while and as the title says below, we're going to be talking about equality and literally the myth of equality.  It was actually a subject that I was thinking about doing and it wasn't until a Gentleman left a comment on the previous video.  being woke is a joke Where he said Equality is the biggest single biggest lie in the entire universe.  and John nuke the individual that left that comment is 100% correct equality is a Absolute lie.  It's a myth.  It's a man-made construct.  So where did this myth come from?  Where did this belief of equality come from?  Well, we'll talk about that first.  Then we'll talk about where, one, where it came from.  Two, we'll talk about why it's an absolute myth.  And then three, we'll talk about how it affects society and how it's actually destroying, how equality is actually destroying society.  So where did this belief that all men are created equal, or where is this belief first?  Where did this belief of equality come from?  Well, it came from these guys.  I've shown a few of you guys this book before.  If none of you have seen it, this is it.  I'm not one of them.  This is for the 33 degreeers.  But here's the thing.  You can't put all the onuses on these individuals because a huge amount of the ancient esoteric knowledge that is in this book also came from the Kabbalah.  And who wrote the Kabbalah?  Unfortunately, I can't say their name on YouTube down here in New Zealand because they are protected under New Zealand's hate speech laws.  So any mention of the individuals that brought about the Kabbalah and wrote that ancient mysticism will get this video knocked off its platform, even though I'm not saying anything hateful about them.  So it was the people that invented or brought about the ancient mysticism of the Kabbalah that was then picked up by these guys.  They first passed hands into the Templars and the Knights.  Templars were the ones that brought that ancient knowledge back to England at some point.  The Masons picked that ancient knowledge up.  In this book is many of the foundations of the U.S.  Constitution.  And one of those foundation beliefs are that all men are created equal in the eyes of God.  It's in the U.S.  Constitution.  It is in this book.  It is in the Kabbalah.  So that will explain to you where this belief, where this construct or this ideology of equality came from.  So, are men truly all created equal in the eyes of God?  No, they're not.  And I'm going to explain to you why.  In a previous video about why all the craziness or where all this craziness is coming from, I mentioned about the 26,000 year solar cycle that the sun goes through.  And the sun does go through this 26,000 year cycle.  It does cycle through its own solar system.  Scientists know this.  NASA knows it.  Everybody knows that this is what the sun does.  The Mayans knew about it.  So many ancient cultures knew about this information, this wisdom, this knowledge, right?  Some of you will remember in 2012 that the Mayan calendar came to a screeching halt.  It finished and there was a huge amount of people out there talking about the end of times.  Even in the Bible.  End of times.  It's the end times.  It's the apocalypse.  It's all coming to an end.  Well it did.  The sun came to the end of its full 26,000 year solar cycle.  supposedly at the end of 2012.  I kind of have a bit of a different opinion on that, but we'll leave it at that.  The reality of the situation, I believe it is actually this year.  And that's why you're seeing, you know, you're going to see a lot of stuff going on in this world.  I think that they got the 12 and the 21 mixed up.  So with that being said, This 26,000 year solar cycle is something that came from the creator.  Creation, universe, nature, God, whatever you want to call it.  Now here's the thing.  If creation, nature, God, whatever you want to call it, and science can agree that the sun goes through this rotational, rotates through its own solar system, and all these ancients, even the Mayans knew about it, well there's got to be some credence to that, right?  So if we take that 26,000 year solar cycle and you divide it into 12 different sections, that's the representation of the 12 different signs of the zodiac, the 12 monkeys, the 12 astrological signs of the Chinese calendar, the 12 signs in the Mayan calendar, and so on and so forth.  Now, the reason why I'm telling you this Is it something that I actually researched myself?  I went down the rabbit hole of this knowledge because as I was learning about myself, different things popped up in my world and I never turned down any information.  because I was wanting to learn about myself.  I was wanting to grow.  I was wanting to increase my knowledge base about who I was and get these fundamental answers or some sort of base knowledge of who I was as a human being to be able to build myself from that.  Because I knew that what I was doing and the direction that I was going, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, wasn't working for me.  So yeah, I am sharing with you the same information that I discovered.  If it's good enough for me, then it's going to, I hope it helps you.  So, when we are born into this world, the sun is in a particular position in its own solar system.  That influences who you are as an individual.  Now, we have the planet rotating around the sun.  The interesting thing is when you look at that solar cycle, And the 12 positions of that solar cycle, it's also the same as your regular clock.  It's no accident that your regular clock is divided into 12 hours and then 12 months.  12, 12, 12.  So, where this planet is in relationship to its rotation around the sun, which is another representation of that solar cycle that, as far as time is concerned, dictates an aspect of who you are as an individual.  Now, when you look at the planet, the planet is divided into 12 sections.  Where you are located on the planet in those 12 sections dictates who you are as a human being.  when you were born.  Then you've got the planets that rotate around the sun also.  The position of them dictates who you are as a human being when you're born onto this planet.  But here's something that is left out of that whole mess.  The sun and the entire solar system is rotating through the galaxy.  It's constantly moving.  So if God, nature, creation, developed, designed, however this came about, there is absolutely no way that we can be equal, primarily because of the fact that we're constantly moving.  Not one of us are the same.  There is absolutely zero equality in us.  None.  Period.  If God created this, whatever it is that we're a part of right now, then us moving, constantly moving, and each individual person is being born at a different place at a different time, and all those aspects define who you are as an individual, then there is no way that equality could ever possibly exist because not one of us are the same.  We all are different in some way, shape or form.  And if you think that I'm full of BS, I would really highly recommend researching human design chart.  I've done this a number of times.  It's like a crystal ball.  It's like a looking glass into who you are as an individual.  It's one of the most brilliant things I think anybody has ever brought about on this planet.  And there's a reason why you don't know about it.  Because certain individuals out there don't want you knowing that you are intrinsically unique to who you are.  And that there is absolutely no way that you are equal to anybody else.  Because so long as you are trying to be equal as somebody else, you are not going to be focusing on your own individuality.  You're not going to focus on who you are.  You're not going to focus on trying to be who you are, embracing who you are, loving who you are, and enjoying your abilities of being who you are.  That's it in a nutshell.  I'm an incredibly creative human being.  But yet, I'm not as creative as a lot of other people out there.  I look at some people who are creative, artistic.  I'm like, oh my God, you guys are amazing.  But do I try to be like them?  No.  And vice versa.  I know people that look at what creative, artistic people that look at what I do.  And I'm like, oh my God, dude, you're incredible at what you do.  But are they trying to be who I am?  No, because as a creative individual, we tend to focus... What we love doing and it's the creative people that actually really start to really Understand what I'm telling you, but here's the thing all of you are creative in your own way But so long as you're focusing on trying to be like that person or wanting to wear those clothes or wanting to have a house like those people or wanting to be able to be paid the same amount as men, or wanting to be able to do the same stuff as men, or wanting to be able to do this or do that, this endless cycle of trying to be the same as somebody else, it's insanity.  And that's why they do it.  It keeps you running on the hamster wheel of life.  It keeps you continually. ",
