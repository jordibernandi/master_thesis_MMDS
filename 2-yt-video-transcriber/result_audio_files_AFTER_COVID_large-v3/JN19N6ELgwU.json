            "text": "The FBI has raided a Democrat state senator's home and business in Tennessee.  State Senator Katrina Robinson is refusing to answer questions about the raid of her home and business.  Once again, Democrats probably not very happy with this news, as before she was the subject of this FBI raid, State Senator Katrina Robinson was promoted as a rising star in the Democrat Party.  In 2018, young Democrats gave Robinson the Barack Obama Award.  She was also named one of the top 40 under 40 by Memphis Business Journal in 2017.  The FBI executed these search warrants on Friday.  There have been growing questions since then.  News outlets are wondering why Senator Robinson won't explain what is going on.  Reporter on Friday said FBI agents have left the healthcare institute where they spent the morning investigating.  We saw FBI agents walking out with boxes and laptops as seen in these pictures.  Another reason the public is demanding answers from Senator Robinson over what's happening with her business has to do with the fact that the Health Care Institute has received $2.3 million in federal grant money over the past four years.  This article gives a few details on what we do know so far.  Article opens saying the FBI executed search warrants at the personal business and home of State Senator Katrina Robinson Friday.  The FBI executed warrants at the Health Care Institute, a for-profit college that provides nursing training, which Robinson founded.  It also executed a warrant at a Whitehaven home owned by Robinson.  The FBI declined to comment on the investigation.  Robinson, 39 years old, did not return a phone call or text messages from the commercial appeal seeking comment.  Robinson, a Democrat, represents Senate District 33, a district that comprises much of the Whitehaven and Parkway Village areas of Memphis.  Attorney Edward Stanton confirmed Friday in an email that he had been retained by Senator Robinson in connection with the events.  Derek Hodges, owner of the State Farm Office next to the Health Care Institute, said that Robinson, the Memphis Democrat, had been a model neighbor for the last three to four years.  Quote, I had no reason to suspect anything, Hodges said.  He said it caught him off guard to see the FBI activity Friday morning.  Tevin Payne was nearby the Health Care Institute on Friday morning when the FBI activity was underway.  He described seeing people in FBI gear moving filing cabinets from inside the healthcare institute into white vans.  Another witness explains that he saw what appeared to be FBI agents at 7 a.m.  that morning.  Quote, they came in like a parade.  He noticed several students arrive at the school and then immediately leave.  At about 12.15  p.m.,  the doors to the health care institute were locked.  And they add how another business, also owned by Robinson, Celebrity Body Studio, which sits in the same plaza, has been shuttered for about eight months.  Boxes were visible inside Friday afternoon.  Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Tennessee Senate Democrat Caucus said, \"...we've been made aware of the investigation and have received no indication that it relates to the legislature or her legislative service.  Because the investigation is ongoing, we will not be making additional statements and will defer any further questions to Senator Robinson's  attorney.\".  According to its website, the Health Care Institute was founded by Robinson in 2015.  It received at least $1.6 million in federal funding from the U.S.  Department of Health and Human Services.  The website also says, quote, Katrina wrote her own grant proposal and successfully secured the grant.  The funding is used to provide scholarships for people like those that she mentored looking for a jumpstart to their education.  There's a few more recent updates from localmemphis.com.  From late yesterday, they said that they'd learned new information about the FBI raid at the home and business of Tennessee State Senator Katrina Robinson.  Again, they add how Robinson founded the Health Care Institute in southeast Memphis with a $1.6 million federal grant.  Short video I watched earlier today from a local ABC outlet says that the total amount of money that the Institute has received from the government is now closer to $2.3 million.  LocalMemphis.com says that they did some digging and found out what Robinson promised to do with that money.  So far, Senator Robinson is choosing not to answer any questions about last week's visit from the FBI.  They say that on Monday, although staff was sitting at the front desk, the doors remained locked and no one would let them inside.  Friday, students reported to the media that federal agents had asked them questions about if they were receiving grants for the program.  According to the Health Care Institute's website, it was founded by Robinson after getting a grant to train certified nursing assistants.  They say that they've uncovered the paperwork Robinson used to get the grant.  In the abstract, she says over a three-year period, she would train 575 nursing assistants and educate 300 families about Alzheimer's and dementia care.  She also promised to provide continuing education for 700 direct care workers who work in geriatrics.  She said she would produce more community facilities designated as dementia care competent.  Sources familiar with how large federal grants work say if you don't do what you say you're going to do or don't comply with the required associated compliance paperwork, there can be an audit or investigation.  According to reports, school leaders filed at the state that more than 500 students were trained as certified nursing assistants during that period.  Local Memphis also adds, we don't know if the rest of the grant obligations were fulfilled, and it looks like neither Robinson nor her employees have any desire to answer our questions.  We were ordered to leave the premises.  This article closes off saying, while the original grant was just over $1.5 million, according to usaspending.gov, that's just part of the $2.3 million Robinson's Healthcare Institute received over the past four years.  We left messages for Robinson and her lawyer Monday, but no one returned our calls, local Memphis adds.  They conclude saying that Robinson also has not issued any statement explaining what happened to her constituents, even though she's been posting on social media about other topics.  So Katrina Robinson is refusing to give answers as to what happened on Friday.  Meanwhile, she's still posting on social media.  Just one day after the raid, Senator Robinson posted this on her Facebook page, saying, I'm excited about what will blossom from those who came today, seeking knowledge and inspiration to get to the next level.  She's been posting similar updates on her Twitter page as well, again with no mention of what happened during Friday's raid.  Senator Robinson is also a member of the Senate Energy, Agriculture, and Natural Resources Committee, and a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.  She was also chair of the Shelby County Ethics Commission.  and a member of the National Organization of Black Elected Legislative Women.  On her own LinkedIn page, Katrina Robinson calls herself a leader, visionary, and trailblazer, formidable businesswoman, Katrina blazed her own path, she says, by starting an independent healthcare career school, the Healthcare Institute.  The Healthcare Institute has grown to become the leading independent vocational school in Memphis and Tennessee's only black-owned nursing school.  Katrina has catapulted into leadership with a passion for public service.  She has proven to be a champion for education, economic justice, and an ethically reconciled Memphis.  So why are Robinson and her attorney still refusing to give any explanation as to what happened during this FBI raid on Friday?
