            "text": "The Atheist Debates Patreon Project presents.  What Does the Bible Say About Abortion?  So a strange thing happened the other day.  I saw a tweet.  I thought it was a tweet from someone called The Transformed Wife, but I can't find the tweet right now.  But it essentially started off with, The Bible says abortion is murder and blah blah blah therefore.  And it was related to the election.  And so I thought I'd take a look at this because, first of all, it doesn't matter whether or not the Bible says something is murder.  Murder is a particularly specialized legal word which applies to wrongful killing.  And so at most what you should be saying is that the Bible would support the notion that abortion should be considered murder.  Because right now in the United States, in the case abortion is not considered murder, and it will probably never be considered murder even if they make it illegal because that would be them.  defining this fetus as a person and granting personhood to a fetus fundamentally changes a number of things related to its rights.  now i'm happy to say over and over again, many times over many years that I don't care at all what the Bible has to say.  That's not strictly true.  I love studying what the Bible has to say, specifically because it gets it wrong so often.  So I have an interest in what the Bible says, but I don't have an interest from an authoritative perspective.  Like I'm not reading the Bible to find out how I should live my life.  If anything, I'm reading the Bible to find out, hey, it's telling you to live your life in a way.  that's not a particularly good idea and here's why.  But you would think something as significant as abortion, something that the religious right in the United States have become almost single-issue voters over, evangelical Christians so adamantly opposed to a right to choose and a right to abortion that it becomes the only thing they can focus on and they just rail and rail and rail.  You would think that in that situation the Bible would be very clear, like there's an 11th commandment.  Thou shalt not abort a child.  But no such commandment exists.  So, hang on, what does the Bible say about abortion?  Specifically, nothing.  Despite the fact that abortion seems to have a long history and should have been something that would have been practiced or known about, at least along with some portions of the Bible, it doesn't talk about it.  It may in fact hint at abortion, but generally speaking, the Bible is silent.  I don't just mean the word doesn't exist, I mean the concept may not exist at all, and to whatever extent the concept of abortion actually exists, the Bible is perhaps worse than anything we would be advocating for from a perspective of a right to choose.  The verse most commonly cited is I think Jeremiah 1.5?  Yes, Jeremiah 1.5, which is a passage that says, Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you.  Before you were born, I sanctified you.  I ordained you a prophet to the nations.  Now, of course, the Bible is talking to an individual here, but the way the theistic reasoning goes is God is saying that before he formed you in the womb, he knew you.  Now, that isn't... The phrasing on that is suitable to be interpreted as if it were opposed, not to abortion, but set, uh, supporting the notion that life and identity and personhood begins, not just at conception, but before conception, because this is saying before I formed you in the womb, I knew you.  now, even if we assume that this is, you know, this is God talking and God acting, um, it would be.  it's entirely possible.  this could be viewed poetically for example I don't have any kids but I've often fantasized about having kids what my life would be like with kids and I could imagine a scenario where I would sit down with whoever my child is eventually and say long before you were my child I knew you and it's not a technically true statement it is It is an outpouring of love saying, you are what I hoped for.  You are what I would have wanted.  I couldn't have dreamed up a child better than you.  It's very, it's Pinocchio-esque in that, you know, hey, I didn't get what I thought I wanted, but I got exactly what I needed and what I had always envisioned.  So you could view the Bible as poetic in that sense for Jeremiah 1.5.  But there's nothing about that passage that in any way suggests that you shouldn't terminate pregnancy.  It just means that, you know, hey, God's claiming he's known you all along.  Except that we know you weren't eternal, because nothing could be eternal but God.  So at most you were a thought or an idea before you became conceived.  It's a conception.  When we really look at what the Bible has to say about pregnancy, though, and offspring, Exodus 21, if you're struggling and it causes a woman to have a miscarriage, then you'll be punished.  But if mischief follows, then you'll give life for life.  So essentially you have a pregnant woman, and if during the course of a struggle they miscarry, there is some punishment for the person who caused that miscarriage.  as long as that woman doesn't die.  If in fact the woman dies, you will be put to death, life for life.  And so that first verse there, Exodus 21 verses 22 and 23, sets up a disparity where the woman is a life and the fetus is not.  If the fetus dies, there's a penalty because you've cost a living, breathing person the offspring that they were desirous of.  not because you have done wrong or killed a person.  They are not equal.  In fact, when taking a census from one month to five years old, then you shall evaluate them as five shekels and number them that way.  The census taking, it would be very difficult to look at and say, well, look, they don't consider a four-year-old to be a person.  And to some extent, that's true.  They didn't.  They wouldn't have.  They would have looked at all of those things as property of the parent.  They owed the parents respect, and the parents were to raise them, but raise them in specific ways.  Fetuses in infants less than a month old aren't counted.  when tallying up the number of people.  So like when you come to a house, if there's eight people in the house and two of them are under a month old, then you count six people for that house and you move on.  Now, did that have something to do with the infant mortality rate?  Possibly.  We're not completely sure about all of what this points to.  But God also didn't have any problems supposedly telling people to run around killing people.  By the way, you can go to skepticsanitatedbible.com and in their section about what the Bible says about look up abortion for these verses, which is exactly one of the two things I did.  I have a second page as well.  that goes through this because I don't necessarily agree with everything.  is here the way that everything's interpreted.  One of the things that's somewhat difficult is in Numbers, there's a passage where if essentially it's Numbers 5, 21 and 27 through 28.  But if you suspect that your spouse has been unfaithful to you, then you make this concoction.  which should bring about a curse and you, it, this concoction causes the, your bowels to, or the curse would go into your bowels and it makes your belly swell and your thigh rots.  And the woman shall say, amen.  Amen.  Basically, it seems to be describing an abortifacient, something you could drink that could cause potentially, uh, a miscarriage or an abortion, a termination.  Because if the woman has been faithful, then she'll be fine and she'll be able to conceive.  And if the woman hasn't been faithful, then it will cause all kinds of problems.  Now, there's debate because we don't know exactly what this passage means.  Is it going to cause sterility or is it going to cause an abortion?  It's possible.  I suppose, to create concoctions that do either.  The concoction described, I don't know that it could do anything.  But this is more kind of old school blood magic of you... You want to let the fates decide only for a culture that doesn't want to throw it up to nondescript fates.  It's let God decide.  So you say you've been faithful.  He thinks you haven't been faithful.  You're going to drink this and God's going to decide.  Um, the problem with this is that whether it's forced sterility or a forced abortion, both of those are immoral and wrong.  and neither of those is there any mechanism to go from, hey, this chemical substance did this to your body, therefore you were cheating, or hey, this chemical substance didn't do this to your body, therefore you weren't cheating.  There is no magical mechanism between those two things.  The strange thing here is that The Bible is advocating for magic.  Not do a card trick, do an illusion magic, but magic, magic, blood magic.  You've done something wrong, we're going to give you this magic potion, and then God is going to decide whether or not you are faithful.  Everything about this is immoral and stupid.  Because if he's God, he doesn't need you to drink a potion in order to punish you with either sterility or miscarriage.  And if there's no God involved, and if the potion that you're drinking doesn't care about your guilt or innocence, then this is just a system by which any woman suspected of not being faithful can now be punished.  We can feed them this concoction and either we don't have to care about somebody else's bastard child or this woman can no longer conceive because she's not my property.  Everything about this gets back to this notion that women are viewed as second tier citizens.  Women are viewed as property.  It's a woman who can commit adultery and a man just had multiple wives and concubines and mistresses and all those things.  There was no parity in the system.  Later on this week, I'm going to do a video about the lack of proper parity with pregnancy in general, because it prompted a phone call to the atheist experience.  But I don't want to go into the specifics of that call yet, but it's coming.  I may release it first.  I don't know.  But at the end of the day, irrespective of what you think of abortion, what you think the abortion right is, it is simply wrong to say the Bible states that abortion is murder.  The Bible doesn't state abortion is anything.  and murder is a particular legal result.  And the Bible has many cases where God and or leaders are sanctioning people to run around, not only slaughtering people, but slaughtering children and slaughtering pregnant women and kill every woman who has known man and any non-virgin.  and keep all the virgins for yourself.  The Bible is a horrific book of awful things.  And yet to see modern evangelicals tell the story, it's the most wonderful guidebook ever.  And we should just avoid these passages where it looks like the ancient Israelites were sanctioning, poisoning any woman who was suspected of wrongdoing.  That's not the Bible being opposed to abortion.  That's the Bible being opposed to women. ",
