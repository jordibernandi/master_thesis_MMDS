            "text": "hey guys i just wanted to have a really quick chat about children education and parenting.  um i just came out with a book actually called henry the sheepdog and the wolf of mossville.  it is a children's book on how the media spin things lie about people how the press can get stories wrong and ruin lives and I felt it was really important to write in this time where there's so much news going around that the headline says something completely different.  The article says something completely different to what has actually occurred, whether it be the very fine people myth with Donald Trump or articles I've read about myself where I can't even recognize the person they are writing about.  Now, I kind of thought this would be a bipartisan take.  Doesn't matter if it's not saying right wing media, it's not saying left wing media.  It's just giving kids the tools to know.  Don't believe every headline you read.  Think about it a little more, question it, search for the evidence.  But no, of course not.  I had an incredible reaction from some folks who decided to say this was indoctrination, that they can't believe.  I'm dragging children into politics and trying to make them distrust the media.  This is absolutely horrible.  And one person even said that any parent who buys my book and reads it to their child should be investigated by the state and have their kids taken away from them by Child Protective Services.  a super normal and not radical communist response to a children's book whatsoever.  Seriously though, I want to talk about this for a second because Firstly, telling kids not to believe everything they read is quite literally the opposite of indoctrination.  But there is this idea going around that parents should just stand back and not have any input in their children's thoughts, ideologies, and the way that they see the world.  Otherwise, you're indoctrinating your kids and forcing your view on them.  This is absurd.  There are people all over the world in media, government, schooling, everywhere that want to sell your kids some sort of idea that want to bring your child into their cult, into their ideology, whatever it may be.  And they are going to try to get your kid in every way possible.  And if you as a parent stand back and don't parent and don't teach your kid critical thinking skills, or different perspectives on the world, well, someone else is gonna teach your kid for you.  If you don't raise your child, someone else will do it for you.  And it'll probably be the state, it'll probably be the education system, it'll probably be celebrities.  The idea that if a kid isn't influenced by their parents, they're somehow just gonna go on and critically find their way in the world is absurd.  Children are influenced by everything around them.  I just got a call from my parents the other day who said, they're they had basically an emergency church meeting when a bunch of the kids came home from school and started telling their parents they couldn't believe and this is a canadian school a canadian public school they couldn't believe that black people were being murdered indiscriminately by the united states government that there was basically a genocide of black people going on in the u.s.  and all these parents are like what are my kids learning in school?  they keep coming home and getting new lessons about, I mean, there are kids that are now questioning their gender identity in elementary school, kids who think their parents are white supremacists just because they are a Christian conservative family or not even that political.  I mean, their kids are just coming home with bizarre ideas about the world and with extremely progressive slant to the politics.  So them just stepping back and saying nothing just means that the teacher in the school with whatever their politics is, is going to implement their views on the child.  And I'm not saying tell your kids, be a conservative like me or be a liberal like me.  You have to have my values.  There are phenomenal ways of raising your kid to be a critical thinker.  When I was younger, my father never imposed his beliefs on me.  I would come home from school and I would tell him I learned XYZ in school today.  And he'd say, that's interesting.  Have you ever considered this view though?  And he would offer me counter perspectives and he would offer me books and articles that challenged the things I learned in a classroom.  If I read Naomi Klein in the class, I'd come home and he'd give me a book by Andrew Breitbart and say, that's great, consider this as well.  So I got to sit and make up my own mind about what I thought was the better ideology.  And you know, my parents didn't leave me to just decide how I wanted to, what I thought morality was.  In fact, every fairy tale we read growing up, most of them have some sort of important life lesson, whether it be Pinocchio, which is not lying, Peter Pan, you have to grow up at some point, lots of lessons.  And my parents would tell me, you know, don't steal, don't lie, try to be kind, try to be honest.  These are good life lessons.  Same with this, question headlines that you read.  This shouldn't be a partisan take.  These are just lessons that you need to talk to your kids about.  And I'm just so disturbed by this pushing of the idea parents shouldn't be parenting.  So if you are a parent and you are interested in offering some alternative views to your child, you can get Henry the Sheepdog on Amazon right now.  It's just a really nice illustrated story.  Kind of think Roald Dahl reading comprehension, elementary school, seven to 11.  The story is about a sheepdog who gets an unfortunate photo taken of him by a journalist where the journalist couldn't see the whole picture.  He couldn't see that he was defending his friend from a bear.  So all he got was this terrifying photo of his face where he's growling and barking.  And the journalist goes back to town and tells everyone in the town that there's a wolf coming and they all form an anti-wolf mob and they refuse to believe Basil, his friend and the sheepdog, but he's not a wolf.  Eventually at the end, he saves the journalists from the bear and they still won't tell the truth because they're journalists and they don't want to ruin their reputation, but luckily a little new press of hamster pups decides to publish the story when they were hiding in a tree and got the pictures themselves.  so it's a really cute story.  it kind of teaches all the different angles teaches that you know sometimes journalists aren't always lying and they just get a story wrong they see the wrong angle and sometimes they are and they're just trying to save their reputation and their paper and make money.  so it teaches all the different ways that journalists can spin things and why they do what they do when they get it wrong and that there are good people there are press that are trying to bring truth as well.  so if you're interested in that find it on amazon.com.  And I know a lot of the rest of you are probably like, Lauren, I don't care about a children's book.  Where is Crossfire?  You said it would be out weeks ago.  I know.  Bear with me.  Scooter and I are just putting some last finishing touches.  We did a rough screening in Sydney and it went fantastic.  People are loving it.  But we still, there are things that we can perfect to make it better.  And I'd rather it come out a little later than us not do these little changes here and there.  So That should be out in about a week or so.  I promise, this time I'm serious.  Stay tuned, a week or two, Crossfire will absolutely have dropped, and I know you guys are gonna love it.  So I'm excited to see you then, and thank you for watching my little rant. ",
