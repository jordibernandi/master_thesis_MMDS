You guys want me to give it to you?  So, we're gonna go, we're gonna go face down, and we're gonna take off.  Okay, son?  I'd like to make sure we're safe.  Okay, what's your name, bro?  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What up y'all?  I guess somebody ran from the cops over here.  They've detained two people so far.  They already said this guy doesn't match the description.  I'm looking out for your safety, homie.  No problem.  You still treat him like a criminal even though you know it's not him.  That's great, my nigga.  All right, man, take it easy.  Okay.  All right.  Huh?  No.  No.  No, that's definitely not him.  All right, we're out.  Yep.  All right, folks, so again, cops made a stop.  I guess when they were cuffing somebody, they took off and ran from them.  They just stopped this guy as a possible suspect.  Actually, it's the second time they stopped him within two blocks.  Ended up letting him go because he didn't match the description.  They're looking for somebody that ran from them.  You can see this guy got no plates.  Neither does this one. ",
