            "text": "Welcome to the Thought News Network, where we expose thoughts one headline at a time.  I have an article here, an interesting one, titled The Reason 67% of Married Women Want Sex.  to cheat.  Quoting the article, here we go.  It happens to the best of us.  We're in a committed relationship for years, then we realize, meh, the passion just isn't what it used to be.  It might not be an easy thing to admit, but if you ever have felt that way, you're not alone.  As Eric Anderson, a professor of masculinity, intimacy, and sport at the University of Winchester explains, quote, The most predictable thing about a relationship is that the longer it progresses, the quality and frequency of intimacy between the couple will fade.  This is because we get used and bored of the same body.  It seems like a very human response to monotony, if you ask me.  End quote from Mr.  Anderson.  Anderson also happens to be the chief science officer at the website Ashley Madison.  If you've yet to hear this site, then allow me to explain.  It's a dating website for married people.  who are looking to have flings.  Depending on where you stand on morals, you may either think that this is the worst thing in the world or that it's a brilliant concept.  As with any dating site, Ashley Madison definitely does their research.  Anderson and his fellow scientists looked into 100 straight married women between the ages of 25 and 45 to see why it is that women cheat.  I mean, why not just get a divorce?  What they found was that 67% of the women just want some passion and intimacy back in their lives again.  They want to be wined and dined and made to feel like they're appreciated and attractive again.  What the study also found is that of those 100 women, zero of them wanted to get a divorce.  In fact, as Anderson noted, they were all adamant that they were not looking for a new husband.  Think about that.  I got to stop right there, man.  They wanted to be appreciated and wanted, and they wanted that passion back again.  Hmm.  Not trying to get the passion back with their husband, but with someone new, huh?  Typical, right?  Back to the article.  Many even started their overt love of their husbands, painting them with a positive light, really a positive light.  And then you're going to go and cheat on them.  Oh, Typical, right?  This is the world we live in.  Back to the article.  So a writer named Charles went undercover on Ashley Madison to see whether he possessed a married guy.  look and went on to have a fling with a married woman so that he could come close to understanding as to why women cheat.  And he pointed out, according to the Journal of Couple and Relationship Therapy, nearly 50 percent of married women and 60 percent of married men will have an extramarital affair at some point in their marriage.  And since those percentages have doubled in the last 10 years, it only makes sense that we get to the heart of the matter and figure out why.  Charles went on a date with three women whom he referenced in his article.  Not only did the three women share the same complaints like lack of passion and lack of attention, but it also seemed to be a constant theme with most women in their Ashley Madison profiles.  At one point, he asked one day why she stayed with her husband.  And she said, quite frankly, I love him.  Wow.  Isn't that some type of love?  That's an article.  Quote, when a man begins dating a woman, he puts tons of effort.  He woos her once she's in his life.  He stops putting forth that effort.  But still, she longs for it.  She wants to be desired.  She wants to be desired.  pursued and connected with on a regular basis.  so many men seem to be missing the boat.  they start strong having a decent sense of how to capture a woman at the beginning but upon entering a relationship they are unprepared for the long haul and investment in a successful relationship.  A successful relationship demands that goes past the dating phase.  The situation starts to reek of complacency and satisfaction into mediocrity.  Charles said one woman stated that, quote, I've been married for less than six months.  I may not be at the stage where I'm searching for passion from another man.  But even this early on in my relationship, I can say that marriage takes work.  As Charles put it more eloquently, marriage doesn't take work per se, but it does require a concerted effort and investment in each other and in you.  Anyone will tell you there is a difference between love and intimacy and the same goes for love and passion.  Just because you love your partner, it doesn't mean you're giving them everything they need.  If you want to be in it to win it, you need to step up your game.  I don't condone cheating, but I don't condemn it either.  I also don't think we should fault a woman whose husband hasn't paid attention to her in years, intimately or otherwise, for cheating.  We're intimate beings and having desires and wanting to be desired is just how we're made.  If anything, Ashley Madison appears to be doing a great service to these women whose husband appeared to have forgotten them.  And honestly, that's something I never thought I'd say.  End quote from the article.  Sixty seven percent of married women want to cheat on their husbands.  The reason why?  Huffington Post.  I am not surprised at the rhetoric.  I'm not surprised at the narrative that when she cheats, as Charles said, who has a gyno mind, when she cheats, it's always the man's fault.  Interesting.  What about free will?  What about choices?  What about decisions?  None of those things are relevant, huh?  It's his fault.  Instead of getting a divorce, instead of talking about it, instead of going to counseling, the solution is for her to cheat.  It's never her fault.  When the monotony of everyday life sets in, when she realizes that a relationship is not always about flowers, cards and candies and a good time and good feelings, that such things are fleeting.  When the bills are due, when work has to be done, when the guy is exhausted from trying to provide for you and you still want all of this romance.  The solution is to cheat, huh?  Where is the sense in that?  Never satisfied.  Basically, the argument is all the chasing that Bubba did to get a he has to keep it up and even push that at a faster and more exponential rate.  Even when you married, you still have to chase, huh?  You still have to seek her satisfaction and validation, huh?  You still have to give her loads of attention like you did the first week, the first month.  Amazing.  No matter if there are children involved now, no matter if you got a second job now, none of those things matter.  You must chase, chase, chase like a dog chasing his tail.  And guess what?  Even if you do all of those things, she'll still want something new.  Why?  Because as I always say, for her, relationships are just carousel breaks.  They desire the dating sites.  They desire the multiple guys.  They desire the carousel.  And this is a fact.  This is life today.  Here it is.  Relationships like carousel breaks, right?  That's what I say.  Got a video on it.  So either she leaves the relationship because the relationship is just a break to get back on the carousel.  She stays on a carousel and temporarily gets off the carousel to be in a relationship.  Then she gets back on.  But there's another equation, another dynamic.  There is such a thing in which she's comfortable with the financial situation.  She feels secure, as they like to say.  So since they want to get back on the carousel, the thing then, since they're secure, is not to give up their security, but keep the security and get back on the carousel while maintaining a relationship, which is called cheating.  so you may want to think about those things because i might just be talking about your girl.  like the video.  subscribe to the channel.  hit that notification button so that you will not miss a black ram.  313 video.  in the description box are links to the cash app to the paypal to the patreon to the second channel and to an email address.  if you'd like a one-on-one consult.
