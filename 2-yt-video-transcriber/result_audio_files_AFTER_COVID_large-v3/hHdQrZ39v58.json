This is Dr.  Jennifer Rivera, and we are two homeschool moms with a lot of experience that also work at Answers in Genesis as part of the team that helps develop the resources and programming for the Creation Museum and the Ark Encounter.  And so the purpose of this show is to really help you know how you can incorporate that programming, those resources, and so much more that Answers in Genesis has to offer into your home school.  So today, we are in the Creation Museum bookstore, which has a lot... talk to you about some of the curriculum, the homeschool curriculum that we sell here at Answers in Genesis.  So Jennifer, Dr.  Rivera is going to talk about our God's Design for Science curriculum. ",

            "text": "Yes, so this is a fantastic curriculum and I have used it not only homeschooling with my own children but in a co-op setting as well.  It is a fantastic series and so what they do is they have basically four different overarching themes.  There's a whole set for biology, a whole set for physical science, a whole set for physical science, and then you can get a whole set on technology and different things like that.  And each set comes with three books.  And if you buy the entire set, it'll actually cover an entire year of curriculum, which is fantastic.  And each book kind of is broken down into one-day segments, and that's what I really liked about it.  So there's a very... short passage for students to read.  You can see it's not very long.  It's perfect for elementary and even I would say middle school students could even use this curriculum.  And then at the end of that chapter it has these fantastic review questions.  It even has a little science experiment that's included with every single section.  And all these experiments you can do at home. ",

And then also each set, if you buy the pack, comes with the teacher answer key, and so you don't have to worry about as the parent trying to go find the answers, right?  You have all of that supplied for you as well as downloadable quizzes and tests.  So everything is included for you.  So I really could not recommend a better science curriculum for elementary or middle school students. ",

Now, if you have little children, K through second, there is a younger version, right?  Right, for beginners.  From the same, right?  God's design as well.  So you could buy the younger child's version and then buy the older one for the upper elementary and middle school students.  But I would say this is easily adaptable as well to younger kids.  So if you wanted to teach them all at one time, it wouldn't be an issue with.  Well, ",

I can imagine that would be very, very helpful.  You know, you've homeschooled several at the same time.  And so that's one of the things I really like about our curriculum.  We really try to make it family friendly for everyone, no matter what their age.  So the other one that we're going to talk about is the Answers for Kids Bible Curriculum.  And we have had this out for quite a while.  We both have used it.  I've used it in a Sunday school setting many years ago.  And what I really like about it, I'm going to have Jennifer here open it up for me.  First of all, one of the things important to know is there is a CD or DVD that has PowerPoints for all of the lesson.  And really what it does is it goes through the seven C's.  So you learn the seven C's, starting with creation, ending with consummation.  And then in each lesson, it's going to have activities for you to do.  It's going to have discussion question right here.  It's going to have the lesson itself so you know what to say.  so you don't have to worry.  Maybe this is the first time you've been exposed to this and you want to learn more about it.  That information is going to be there for you.  It's got the passages.  So it goes through the seven C's.  And then after the seven C's are finished, then what it's going to do is it's going to spend some time delving a little bit deeper into some topics like, dinosaurs for example or natural selection or radiometric dating.  now this is a bible curriculum.  okay but what we're going to show you in this curriculum is that god's word.  um that science confirms it.  okay and we can believe it and we can trust it.

It's also got these, you can make copies of these, and I think they're also on the DVD-ROM, and you can make copies of those for activities for the kids to do.  So I just really like this curricula for Bible, okay?  So it's a great curriculum for the whole family.  Again, I've taught this to even younger elementary, but it's also good for upper elementary, so you can really adapt it to all those ages.  All right.  The one last thing we have here that we're going to show.  Now, this isn't necessarily a curriculum, but it's going to go along really, really nicely with any curricula that you have, especially for Bible and history. ",
