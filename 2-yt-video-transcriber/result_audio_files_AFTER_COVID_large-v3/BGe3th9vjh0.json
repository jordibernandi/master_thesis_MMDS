            "text": "This is Richard Wolff for Democracy at Work responding to another Ask Prof Wolff question from our Patreon community.  And this time I'm responding to a question from Tom.  And Tom asks about something called the Great Reset from the World Economic Forum.  It's a response of that assemblage of large corporations very influential in the world.  It's an assemblage of ideas, plans, proposals to deal with some of the fallout of the pandemic that's ravaging the world, and in particular that's ravaging the world capitalist economic system.  And the World Economic Forum wants to respond, wants to have a great reset of the global economy, that accommodates the needs of all the various stakeholders in the capitalist system that is now dominant in the world.  It reminds me of a recent decision by the Rockefeller Foundation here in the United States to commit one billion dollars, its largest commitment to a single objective in the history of the Rockefeller Foundation, to likewise responding to the COVID-19 pandemic and economic crash that have happened together in the year 2020.  And so Tom asked me to comment on this World Economic Forum Great Reset.  My comment is that this is the same old, same old.  In other words, this is the World Economic Forum basically a spokesperson or spokes institution for global capitalism, committing itself to finding ways of coping with the pandemic and with the global crash in such a way as to maintain and indeed to strengthen capitalism.  Capitalism is the beginning, the middle, and the end.  of what the World Economic Forum has been about and is about now.  The Great Reset does not question and does not depart from what the World Economic Forum has been and intends to continue to be.  That's why if you look through the literature of the Great Reset that has been produced so far, what's remarkable to me is the complete disinterest in and indeed a kind of pretense that there is no alternative to capitalism, that the only way to pose a question about the pandemic or about the crash is to say, how can we fix capitalism so that it works better?  This is what they're after, and in that they represent the dominant opinion of those who have led capitalism into this situation.  So my comment shouldn't surprise you.  I don't think that the only way to cope is by preserving and extending capitalism.  I don't think that capitalism is worth preserving and extending because it has failed us.  And you ought to begin your discussion, if you're honest, and if you're open-minded, by asking not only how do we fix the system that failed us, but whether we ought to, whether the better way to go is not to a different, new, alternatively built system.  You know, it's a little like asking after the umpteenth repair of your refrigerator whether or not you really should repair it again, or maybe get a new, different refrigerator.  Let me explain.  One of the first things any economic system has to do, a measure of its adequacy, of its success, is whether that system takes care of, protects the public health.  Sick people, dead people are a sign that an economic system hasn't done its job.  That job may be difficult.  The natural world presents us with all manner of challenges.  It is the job of the economy, among other institutions we have, to deal with those challenges.  We build a home to protect us against the rain and the cold and so on.  We grow crops to take care of our needs to eat.  And we set up a capitalist system also to protect our health.  This system, in the United States especially, but throughout the capitalist world, didn't do that job well.  And I'm being very polite.  It is a disaster, especially in the United States, especially in the United Kingdom, and in a variety of other places.  capitalism as a system failed to prepare for the virus and failed to contain the virus for which it had been unprepared.  We ought to ask the question, which the World Economic Forum cannot and will not do, to what degree is this a system failure?  Let me put it another way.  Capitalism is an unstable system.  Every four to seven years throughout its history, across the world, it has had economic downturns.  You know them by many names.  Recessions, depressions, busts, crashes, downturns, collapses.  We can go on.  We have many words because it's always with us.  And the capitalist system knows this.  Every history shows it.  We knew that if it's on average four to seven years, and if the last downturn was the subprime mortgage crisis of 2008, that we were overdue in the year 2020 for another crash.  And then the worst nightmare of capitalism happened.  that we had a crash at the same time as we had another social crisis, so that we had a double whammy.  And that's what happened.  In February, capitalism's downturn began.  And in March, the pandemic arrived in the United States.  Either one of those was a very formidable problem.  For neither of them was capitalism prepared, even though we know that viruses are there as a danger.  And we know that capitalism's instability has always been there as a danger.  We weren't prepared.  That's a sign of system failure.  And when you have two of these, well then it's not the American dream anymore.  It's the American nightmare.  And it's capitalism's nightmare.  Look around you now, World Economic Forum.  In the United States, tens of thousands of landlords have gone to court to evict hundreds of thousands, millions of renters.  doesn't matter which side wins.  Capitalism as an economic system is going to be hammered, whether those people are forced out of their homes or whether those landlords are forced to do without rent.  Both outcomes are part of capitalism's self-destruction.  What we need now is is not another blinding effort to solve a problem under one condition.  Do not question capitalism.  Do not challenge capitalism.  Do not look elsewhere.  Do not look beyond capitalism.  But those are the rules of the World Economic Forum.  So it cannot inquire whether what we need and might solve our problem would be to change the way we organize enterprises.  So it's not owned and operated by a tiny minority of our people, the employers.  who make all the key decisions for the vast majority, who are employees, and the employers are not accountable to the employees.  Otherwise, they wouldn't dare fire them, make them unemployed.  fail to deal with their public health, and so on.  Maybe we ought to look at a non-capitalist organization of factories, offices, stores, and our institutions, but the World Economic Forum cannot ask the questions.  It cannot think outside the box of a capitalism that isn't working.  And for that reason, I don't expect much from the Great Reset.  This is Richard Wolff for Democracy at Work. ",
