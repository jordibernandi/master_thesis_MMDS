I can put words in your mouth.  But obviously, you could find anyone who would advocate anything.  So I'm sure there are some people who have views that you could adequately say are class reductionists.  But I guess what you're saying is that there's no dominant strand out there.  There's no big, I don't think, contemporary left, especially contemporary left in the U.S that's class reductionist.

There's nobody except, you know, hands full of sectarians or cranks, I mean, someplace, who argue that there's no such thing as racism or that race and gender are epiphenomenal to building the working class movement, right, blah, blah, blah.  But I noticed, I mean, you know, and like this is like the pygmy elephant in the room, but that brouhaha that led to my and Merlin's pulling out from the DSA or the Philly DSA, Lower Manhattan DSA sponsored program.  Wow, was that last week?  I guess it was.  But the objection that the Afro-Socialist and Bipolar Caucus or whatever they are wrote was full of charges that I don't acknowledge the existence of racism and I'm a class reductionist.  And I just think that's foolish on its face.  And the charge has now come to mean anybody who says you need to pay attention to political economy.  And thank God for that strain of the movement.  that Jeff Bezos is never gonna say they need to pay attention to the political economy.  And Jamie Dimon's never gonna say that they need to pay attention to a political economy.  And the other corporations that put up the rest of that $500 million are never gonna say they need to pay attention to political economy.  So I guess they found a real niche. ",

Because I think it's worth actually explaining, you know, hyperbole, you know, aside about this little, you know, spat within DSA.  that I don't think is even worth dignifying.  You know, you wrote... A serious article making a political point that I think that most socialists have explained the actual point as opposed to this second-hand telephone version of an argument that, by the way, anyone could just go read.  But can you explain the actual point and why?  this narrow emphasis on just racial disparities potentially has certain pitfalls as it relates to to COVID-related deaths and actually might hurt us in the attempt to actually undermine the disparities that is leading to the deaths disproportionately of many, many poor people and many of the black and brown.

            "text": "Right.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, I'll try to be concise.  I mean, the problem is that racism doesn't explain anything, right?  It's a label that we put on to more complex dynamics and processes of exploitation and oppression.  But racism itself or the charge of racism itself should always be followed by, when I say this is an instance of racism, I mean, these features of it show racist dispositions, attitudes, the impact of racist structures or whatever.  But so, What's happened with disparity discourse, and for some time now, because the Merlin Chalquanian and I did our article in the Socialist Register on the limits of disparities discourse eight years ago, for God's sake.  Pointing to disparities doesn't explain anything, right?  Like it doesn't, it's an alternative to a causal account, right?  Because you say, see, disparity, racism, but you don't have a causal account of how the inequalities are produced, right?  So that's one problem, right?  Like it doesn't help you get anywhere is that problem.  Another problem is that, and we've seen this already now, I mean, this time around, that the ways that people talk about race in this country and wherever they talk about it are so hopelessly confused and knee-jerk and abstract and incoherent that when you say, I mean, you and I can say that race matters.  Charles Murray can say that race matters.  And I assume you and I aren't going to mean the same thing that Charles Murray means, but there are enough Charles Murray types out there, even who don't think of themselves as Charles Murray types, who would think, who have already indicated that the persistent and what seemed to be large, although as the total cases go up, the disparities can flatten out, disparate impact on black and brown people with respect to the bad outcomes or the worst outcomes from COVID-19 infection are signs of, are evidence or stem from differential racial biology.  So that's one problem, right?  That's lurking there.  But it doesn't have to be a biological metaphor.  Yes, I mean, when the biological metaphor is invoked, right?  I, and I assume a lot of the rest of us, you know, think about that cattle train that ends up at Auschwitz, right?  Because that's where that narrative always goes.  But it can also be cultural, right?  Because race wasn't, I mean, race was always, well, race can't denote anything that's empirically real because the concept is an abstraction, like it's not real.  I mean, I like the way that my son, the birthday boy, did this in his last piece in Jacobin, where he invoked Christianity.  He said, look, Christians believe that Jesus Christ was the son of God.  Jesus Christ doesn't have to be the literal son of God for Christianity to be real and have force in the world.  even not taking into account all the billions of Jews and Muslims and Buddhists and whatever the hell else who don't embrace the belief that Jesus is the son of God, right?  But racism, race exists because of racism, right?  As Barbara Fields has argued also.  It's a cover story, right?  To sustain racism, a particular technology of hierarchy, right?  Exploitation and oppression.  So it's not really dependent on biology in the way that people like to think it is.  And in fact, part of the story of post-war American ideology and the crafting of post-war liberalism and the social sciences is that the Holocaust in particular had, made the notion of biological race had put heavy negative sanctions on it, like at least outside the South in the US.  So the effective race idea moves from biology to culture.  And in this context then, it's the easiest thing in the world, and I think we have both, and we aren't alone, In having done so, we have both seen articles asserting softer or stronger versions of this claim that Blacks and Latinos are more likely to suffer the consequences because they're more likely to have the underlying comorbidity conditions, and they're more likely to have those because of their shitty habits with eating and whatnot.  And therefore, focusing on the racial disparity doesn't even get people to where they think it's going to get them, right?  And one question that I would have to ask at this point, I mean, we already were asking it eight years ago.  If the focus on racial disparity has been so unsuccessful in getting people who are purportedly committed to social change where they wanna go, what's so sweet about continuing to focus on the racial disparity?  What does it do for you that's satisfactory other than a sense.  it doesn't get you to where it is you're trying to go? ",
