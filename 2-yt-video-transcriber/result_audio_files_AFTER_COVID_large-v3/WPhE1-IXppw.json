            "text": "Boxing.  What is boxing?  Discipline, focus, determination, 80% mental and 20% physical.  You can't play boxing.  It takes hard work, dedication, and heart.  How bad do you want it?  Do you got what it takes?  Boxing has kept many people out and away from trouble, an outlet to escape and to explore.  There are too many cowards in this world that are quick to go and pick up a gun and shoot to kill.  Man up with your hands up.  Gloves over guns and God over everything.  Boxing is the best sport ever.  As we Americans are fighting with this COVID situation and taking the proper safety measures, we have to stick together to win this fight.  Teamwork makes the dream work. ",
