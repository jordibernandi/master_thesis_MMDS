Should I stay in here and wait for my wife to get back from the gas station with a key to get in the house?  Holster your goddamn weapon, sir.  Yeah, until my wife gets right back from up the street.  I just got out the fucking car and thought I could get in.  I'm on private property.  Why are you fucking doing this?  Why the fuck are you doing this on my private property?  Huh?  I have a Second Amendment right to fucking bear arms.  I got a First Amendment right to fucking talk.  Yeah, two fucking veterans here and this is how we get treated?  Then point the fucking weapon down until you see a threat.  Get the fuck off my property.  Get up now.  No one's even approaching you.  We've back the fucking way.  I sat that down with her in unlawful order and back the fucking way.  Put your all three weapons.  All three weapons, tough guy.  We've agreed with everything you said.  We did what you wanted.  At least do that much.  Quit pointing a fucking weapon at a goddamn veteran.  Why don't you quit pointing a fucking weapon at a goddamn veteran?  It doesn't matter.  We're on private property.  We're on private fucking property.  I want you all off of the property.  No, no.  Ain't gonna happen.  Ain't nobody broke the law here.  Ain't nobody walking around the streets.  We're on the goddamn private property.  All right, nothing.  Nobody's on the street.  You don't need to find out shit.  Get off my... Pierce, come talk to me, man.  Let's talk.  Let's talk away from these guys, brother.  I'm glad you showed up.  I'm on private property.  My old lady just dropped me off here.  I'm locked out of my house.  I have my 12 gauge unloaded, standing on my private property.  Completely legal.  This motherfucker comes up with a gun in my face.  I'm willing to talk with you.  Let's go buy my truck, please.  Away from these guys.  These guys get fucking fired up.  Let me and him talk, please.  All due respect.  Thank you.  I'm not armed, all right?  I'm not armed.  We're good.  All right.  I know you're hot.  Tell me what's going on.  Like I said, my old lady dropped me off.  I was going to go in the house, but it's locked.  She got the key.  She just ran up here, corner of 6th  Ave.,  to grab fucking cigarettes at the gas station.  So I stood here in my yard with my 12 gauge.  Huh?  Huh?  I'm trying to get everybody calm.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hey, Sean.  Sean.  Hey, buddy.  Calm down a second, but come up here.  Leave them guys alone.  Make them stay there, please.  You know you're safe with me, Pierce.  You know you're safe with me.  So I'm not going to talk and calm down if this man don't back off.  Yeah, I just gave a little uppity when someone had a fucking weapon pointed at my face for no goddamn reason.  I got you.  got two fucking veterans here and this motherfucker wants to act like that.  anyway like i said my lady dropped me off.  i'm locked out.  i had my 12 gauge unloaded hanging with the fucking strap right here standing on private property.  okay wait for her there she is pulling in coming back now pulling in and i was waiting for her with the key to get inside to take my fucking 12 gauge back inside after i just went out laura shooting Okay.  And fucking this guy in that cunt down there shows up with fucking guns pointed at us.  We're on private property.  If we was on the street somewhere, it's a problem.  I'm on private property.  I'm allowed to have my fucking firearm on private property trying to get it into my house.  Okay.  So there's no law been broken here.  I would like to fucking go on about my business and y'all go on about yours and we're good.  Okay, I'll give you a minute, Pierce.  All right.  Hey, Karen!  Karen!  Karen.  No, this is my property, brother.  Get your hands up.  Back him the fuck off of me.  Quit talking to him.  There's nothing to talk to him for.  You ain't placing shit.  You're going to get sued if you do anything.  Okay?  There ain't no law been broken here, Pierce.  I'm trying to walk over here.  I know how you do things.  That's why I'm trying to be respectful to you.  This man puts his fucking hands on me again.  We're going to have a lawsuit.  All right?  There's no law been broken here.  I'll give five minutes, okay?  Because fucking there ain't been no law broken.  Karen, quit talking to them.  There ain't been a law broken.  You crazy motherfuckers, man.  Two-thirds of this department knows me.  They know there's been no law broken here, and they want to fucking be fucking tough guys.  This fucking little punk in that cunt over there started it all because of someone standing on private property with a fucking firearm.  There's a Second Amendment right to bear arms.  Then he wants to tell us to shut up and quit talking?  That's a First Amendment.  fucking right to fucking say whatever the fuck we want to say.  The only fucking man on this scene right now that I got any respect for is Officer Pierce right there.  He's a good guy.  All the rest of them right here.  Well, Alex Johnson's all right, too.  But the rest of these fucking guys, I don't know a lot of them.  But this guy here, he's a fucking bitch.  Yeah, yeah.  What's up?  Here's, you know, I'm straight up.  Yeah, sure.  Here's what we got.  Basically, he said he was driving by.  Yeah.  Saw you walking in the house or towards the house.  Okay.  With a gun.  Okay.  So, therefore, you know.  I'm sorry.  I forgot.  Technically, being us.  Sure.  Come check it out.  It's fine.  That's not a problem.  Exactly.  That's not a problem.  to come check it out.  Therefore, that's what he was trying.  Can you tell her to put my firearm down, please?  Put it on the trunk of my car.  This call is over.  There ain't been a law broken.  I got you.  But right now, what we need to do... Can you please place my firearm on my car, ma'am?  I know she's going to be deaf.  Yeah.  What?  If you would, just do me a favor.  Can I have your ID?  No.  There's been no law broken here.  No, no, it doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter.  There has to be a law broken.  There has to be.  Exactly.  Am I being detained right now?  Am I being detained or am I free to go?  Think carefully, Pierce.  No, it's either I'm detained or I'm not.  I'm just backing him up.  I know we do.  And listen, nothing today here, I don't want nothing here today to affect what we've got, okay?  But I'm telling you to think carefully whether I'm detained or not.  Because, you know, I'm going to walk the fuck away.  If I'm not detained, I'm walking away.  Because I have not broke a law.  And we want our private property returned as well.  Yeah.  And I want names and badge numbers of every officer here.  Especially you, hard ass.  Tough guy right there that wants to point weapons at veterans when we're unarmed with hands up, when we were staying on private property the entire time.  So am I detained for that second?  Just give me a second.  Can you answer that, please?  I'm going to walk away.  For 30 seconds.  I'm detained?  Yeah, give me 30 seconds.  Let him figure out what's going on.  Okay.  I've got a good rapport with you.  I remember talking with you about- We've talked.  Yes, sir.  Welcome back.  I knew you were left out for a little bit.  No, I still don't live back here.  I take care of this property and that one, so I've got to come back and take care of things.  Is this where you're staying at?  Yeah, this is where I'm at right now, yes.  Do you live here?  I don't live here, no.  I live in Pennsylvania.  I take care of this property and that property over there, so I come back here to take care of things, yes.  But I am in physical control of the property.  Okay.  So where are you staying?  I live in Pennsylvania, like I said.  You're not obviously traveling to Pennsylvania, then?  No.  I told you, I stay here.  I'm in physical control of this property.  So this is where you're staying?  This is where I'm staying.  That's what I asked.  So, but anyway, there's been no law broken here.  These guys here need to return my fucking weapon and get off of my property.  Okay.  Okay, look, do I need to cite the statutes?  I know what the statutes are.  Okay, so you know there's no violation of law here.  I locked him out.  I didn't know.  I just dropped him off.  I forgot to keep him still in the park.  You've got plenty of time to run in numbers.  You already know the weapon's not stolen.  You want to return to private property now?  You're going to sit there and solicit our belongings.  Yeah, not right yet.  Well, I'll tell you what.  For every minute I stand here, the fucking dollar value goes up, okay?  So there will be a lawsuit over this.  But you like pointing weapons at people for a good long time, and they show you that they're unarmed and being cooperative, though, right?  Yep.  On private property.  Yeah, why don't you take your ass back there where that young lady's taking you.  Yep.  Look at that.  The lieutenants will come out for this, but they won't come out when the officers are fucking up, though.  They won't come out.  Especially when your brother's fucking up.  You really won't come out.  You're right.  Do what you gotta do.  So, return my weapon, and let's end this.  I just dropped him off.  Just quit talking.  Quit talking.  There's nothing you can say to these guys that'll fucking do any good.  This is the only man that's got any reason here, you know.  Well, actually, like I said, I've talked to him a couple times.  He's been a good guy.  And Alex Johnson's an all right guy, too.  But, you know, so far, I mean, the rest of them, when they're face-to-face just alone with me, they're decent.  But when they get around the rest of the group, oh, no.  Oh, no.  No, no, no, no.  You've been great around anybody you've been around.  Like I said, you, him, and Alex Johnson, all you guys, whether you're around other officers or not, you're the same to me.  But, you know, McLeod, he's one that gets around other guys, and he ain't the same.  Well, my watch is broken, but I'm pretty sure that 30 seconds is over now.  I think so.  What else are we waiting on here, John?  You want your weapon back?  Yeah.  We'd love that.  Yeah.  Okay, well.  No, you won't.  They'll hand it.  They'll give it the fuck back to me.  It's an unloaded 12 gauge.  There is no law been broken here.  And this is an unlawful detention.  If I was on that sidewalk out there, this would be completely legit.  But I was on private property the entire time and was never seen off of this property.  In fact, I got out of the motor vehicle on private property.  So this is an unlawful detention.  And I hope that that ignorant bitch right there fucking does something about the out-of-control cop here.  Oh, it's clear.  Really?  Really?  Y'all really got a hard-on.  think y'all can get me?  Huh.  Huh.  That really fucking sucks.  that you gotta hand back a firearm to an asshole like me, doesn't it?  Y'all have a nice fucking day, okay?  Thank you, Pierce.  Alright, see you later, buddy.  As a matter of fact, I'm just gonna sit on my property now with my firearm.  What?  I'll be honest with you, he's going to report on this.  It's nothing but an officer report.  Is there a way that I can get his ID?  Nobody's getting identification here.  It ain't happening.  Nobody's giving identification.  Like I said, it's been an honor.  Pierce, you did a great job trying to talk to me and stay calm and try to get me away from you, even though that asshole had to be tough to try to follow.  You did a great job.  All due respect, nobody's going to give anything because there was no law broken here.  There's no crime committed.  I understand you got to investigate things.  Like I said, had I been out there on the road or that sidewalk, it would have been completely legit.  I'm on private property.  There was no reason for an officer to even come on this property.  There was nobody called in a threat.  What happened is that fucking bitch there and that bitch there drove by in one car and fucking saw me with a fire.  I'm walking towards the house, as he said.  So that means I'm walking in the house out of a vehicle.  Why are we here like this?  So write the report if you want to.  Do what you want to do.  But, you know, this will be stacking onto the lawsuit against Downey.  So, but anyway, Pierce, have a nice one.  Yeah.  And actually, before y'all leave, I did ask for badge numbers and names of all y'all.  Everybody.  Yeah.  Well, I know you, Pierce, but I know you.  I know Alex Johnson here.  I know McLeod.  What's your name and badge number?  Seagrave?  278?  Okay.  Is that what you tell your judge?  Is that what you tell the judge?  What's your name?  Write it down.  Give me a card.  You're my new pet project, Shepard.  All right.  Have a good one.  Hey, thanks for you being at least respectful, like you always are.  Sure, sure, sure.  I hear you.  Sure.  Well, like I said, on public property, she would have been.  Okay.  So, who's all the other people here?  Nobody wants to follow their fucking policy and give all that shit?  Yeah.  He's a little fucking punk motherfucker.  Yeah, yeah.  Fucking, the only thing that makes it tough is the badge, isn't it?  Yeah.  Imagine the gun, you little fucking cunt.  Fuck you.  Fucking cunt motherfucker. ",
