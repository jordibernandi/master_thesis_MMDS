I'm not entirely certain why we should care about the issues you have with atheism, but maybe someone else will watch this video and understand why those issues are frickin' goofy.  Okay, truth to tell, I haven't watched his entire video.  I don't know what all five issues are.  I mean, his vid is 13 minutes long, and he's kinda boring.  For the love of all things audiovisual, script your damn vids, people.  So my responses will be a surprise to everybody, including me.  Let's do this.  Bionic Dances YouTube channel.  Greetings fellow space travelers, Bionic Dance here.  Sorry it's been a while, but self-isolation during the pandemic has put me in severe don't wanna mode.  And contradiction though it may seem, I've also been very hard at work on that animation I keep talking about.  One voice is proving next to impossible to cast, and another is cast but isn't in the can yet.  But I rendered shot number 14 yesterday, and it's looking nifty in my never humble opinion.  Enough excuses.  Let's get on to this video by a guy calling himself Psychonaut Wispy, whatever that means.  And before we say anything else, let me be grouchy about his horrible framing.  Look at all that negative space above his head.  I know natural instinct is to center your face, but look at all that wasted frame there.  Make the top of your noggin.  hit the top of the frame, Sparky.  Seriously. ",

Second, proving atheism right and religion wrong are the same thing.  If religion is wrong, there is no God, and if there is no God, well, come on, you should be able to fill in those blanks for yourself.  But I'll just say it.  No god should mean no theism, no belief.  And if there's no belief in gods, that's atheism.  The one is a natural consequence of the other.  But, as I said, while some people who are atheists might be attempting this, there's nothing about not believing in a god that encourages one to do so, because atheism has no scripture that tells you what to do or believe, unlike religion.  But theists don't seem to get that.  not everybody has this rulebook like they do.  Our life isn't like yours, a religion without gods.  That's something that seems so hard to digest for believers.

If the religion has any of that, some don't, but the goals come from scripture, or whatever priest equivalent the religion has who tells the followers what their god wants of them.  Being a state of being.  without all of that rigmarole, atheism doesn't provide goals or guidance or anything like it, not all by itself.  Any goals an atheist might have will be secular, but that only means untainted by religion's expectations or restrictions.  Being an atheist gives us freedom, but not direction. ",

To be fair, some people become atheists because they took a scientific look at the universe and found a hard-to-ignore absence of the supernatural at work in any of it, or required by it.  But even then, there was no directive from non-belief to take that scientific look at the universe.

Learn to share and play nicely with the other kids, and I suspect most atheists will shut the hell up about your beliefs.  Except possibly those who left a religion that was abusing them.

Most religions claim that God assigns our lives meaning and purpose, whether we like where we're supposed to go or not, without us having a damn say whatsoever.

The petty and often arbitrary restrictions placed upon our lives if we let religion rule them.  In fact, I can think of a lot of ways my life would be worse if I were religious.  How many things which give me great pleasure which would be forbidden and shameful according to religion.  And yet, these things harm nobody, or at least none who haven't consented to it.

And he told me he was going to send me something because of my last blooper-free video.  And I guess that something is the DeLorean from Back to the Future.  How cool is that?  My geek shelf is kind of full right now, so the question is, do I try to mint and box this thing, or take it out and find somewhere to put it?  Oh, who am I kidding?  This thing's getting opened.  Whoa.  Well, something seemed to fall.  Ah, doesn't matter.  Wow, this thing is die-cast metal, isn't it?  And it's... the... what... how... Okay, maybe that thing that fell was instructions for how to get this thing off.  Do I gotta rip something?  Oh dear, oh dear.  Okay, so I found the thing that fell.  It's that hook deal, the... you know, the electrode thingy that attaches to the power line?  It goes back here.  Somehow.  It doesn't seem to want to fit.  But I'll figure it out later.  It was that.  And so, yeah.  The doors open.  So there's that.  I think that might be the only moving parts except for the wheels.  I believe there's screws on the bottom of this so I can actually take the stupid cardboard out, but I'll do that later when I figure out where to put it, because again, geek shelf, very full.  So thank you, Tom.  I love it.  That's so cool.  I've always wanted a real DeLorean.  Maybe someday when I'm all rich and famous, I'll find a DeLorean and buy one.  Yeah, okay, on to the next thingy-do.  Okay, I'm pretty sure I know what this is.  It's also packed in enough bubble wrap that I could drop it off the frickin' Empire State Building, and it would be perfectly fine in the end, I'm sure.  Yarp.  As I suspected, it's more of that Chinese barbecue sauce I love so much.  It's what you use to make pork fried rice, and I've been experimenting with building my own, because, hey, I like to cook.  And it turns out that there's two of them.  And these come to me from Vonrick.  Thank you, Vonrick.  Actually, I'm thanking you a lot, Captain Generous over there.  Usually it seems like with these, actually, but not exclusively.  Anyway, whatever.  Thank you, Vonrick.  I really appreciate it, especially during this whole pandemic thing.  I mean, I'm trying not to order takeout for every meal.  So, you know, having ingredients is a good thing to make my own more cost effective and frankly, sometimes tastier.  And now the last of today's unboxerings.  And I've actually been going from smallest package to biggest, which oddly enough is also the reverse order in which they came.  So I've been holding on to this for like a week, week and a half or something.  Well, regardless.  Arc Star.  Music for the universe, it says.  Alright, let's have a looky-look.  Off cover-wise, and there we go, yes.  Oh, interesting.  It looks like a Death Star.  Kinda.  Yeah, it's weighted in one direction or another.  Ah, son of a... Uh, I just sort of inadvertently discovered that there is one hell... of a magnet in here.  Truth to tell, I knew there was magnetism involved in this thing, because the guy who sent it to me told me about it beforehand, but I didn't realize it was quite that powerful.  Yikes!  Anyway, cords and cables.  and now we have the base which uh belongs to us i guess yeah plus thank goodness an instruction manual.  so for those of you wondering what this thing does i just paired it to my cell phone because what it does is play music and it uh floats you see.  And this interesting device was sent to me by a fella named Michael, who also goes by LreadL, because you read between the lines, you see.  I am definitely guilty of wordplay my own darn self, so I can hardly fault you for that.  Thank you!  This is pretty cool.  And you can also plug in your cell phone to recharge it.  I mean, fair enough.  If it pairs to the cell phone, you run out of power.  Anyway, thank you so much.  I've been holding on to these boxes for ages, waiting to do an unboxing video and give public thanks to the people who, for whatever reason, decide they want to send me stuff.  If that includes you, well, there's a link to my Amazon wishlist in the description.  But no obligation, obviously.
