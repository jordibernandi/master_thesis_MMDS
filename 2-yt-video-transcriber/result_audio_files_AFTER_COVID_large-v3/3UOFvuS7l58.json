Playford.  to record the common areas, the publicly accessible areas of the courthouse.  And they would not allow me to go in there.  They said there's a judge's administrative order that prohibits recording anywhere in the courthouse, anywhere, even in the publicly accessible areas.  They said that I would be arrested if I did so.  So I left the courthouse and I came outside and I started filming outside.  And here's JC Playford here, walking around the courthouse and filming on the public sidewalk, filming the Sally Ports and the other areas of the courthouse.  And they came out and surrounded me and tried to intimidate me out of recording outside of the courthouse as well.  So there's not a whole lot of transparency that happens in this courthouse.  I've already sued them over this one time, trying to prohibit photography and videography.  When the judge issued that unconstitutional administrative order back in 2015, Thomas Covenant and I, the late great Thomas Covenant and I filed a lawsuit against the chief judge.  Within short order, he had rescinded his administrative order.  But now it seems like he's back to his old tricks. ",
