Now, there are a number of theists who will respond, well... if God didn't do it, then nothing did it.  And how can you say that nothing did it?  And what that's actually doing is that's taking the burden of evidence, right?  If you're making a claim, if you're saying something happened and we ask you to show evidence of it, right, that's on you to do that.  But the idea of flipping that back the other way is shifting the burden of evidence.  So I, I, my question for you is, um, Is that what's keeping you believing in a god?
