            "text": "Hello and welcome to Philosophy Vibe, the channel where we discuss and debate different philosophical ideas.  Today we're going to focus on the works of one of the great ancient Greek philosophers Aristotle and his ethical theory.  Fantastic!  In his book Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle is seen as the pioneer of virtue ethics.  Now, virtue ethics is very unique as its own ethical theory.  Where consequentialist ethics focuses on outcome of any situation and judges right and wrong based on this, and deontological ethics focuses on duty and adhering to strict moral laws, Virtue ethics does not focus on how we should behave.  It does not provide rules and laws, but rather it focuses on the character of the person.  It is about developing into a virtuous person and living a moral life.  It is not about what should I do, but rather what sort of person should I be. ",

This was an end or a purpose.  Everything had a Delos and something was judged as good or bad based on how well it fulfilled its purpose.  So let's take a seed.  The Delos of a seed is to grow into a beautiful flower.  Once it has grown into a flower, it has reached its Delos.  This is also the case with inanimate objects.  If we take a knife, the Delos of a knife is to cut.  If a knife is able to cut when a human wants it to, then it has reached its Delos and it's fulfilling its purpose.  If it cannot cut, then it's not fulfilling its purpose and it is a bad knife. ",

Aristotle believed that virtuous people should have the ability to make informed rational decisions on what the best way to act is.  Aristotle claimed that practical wisdom is a true and reasoned state of capacity to act with regard to the things that are good or bad for man.  So, it is not just having an understanding of virtuous character traits, such as modesty or courage, but it is knowing how to act upon this understanding and implement these character traits when necessary.
