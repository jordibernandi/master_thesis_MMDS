Texas has filed a reply brief to the briefs that were filed by the states that Texas brought this lawsuit against of original jurisdiction and the bill of complaint.  So you had Pennsylvania responding, Georgia, Wisconsin and Michigan.  Texas has responded as well, which means the court.  Could Dad issue an order without anything else? ",

And that includes amicus briefs, including a brief, Andy, with 109 members of the United States Congress.  And also there were some lawyers filed some briefs.  The president intervened, made a motion to intervene with a brief in support.  A reply brief was filed early this morning by Texas.  So the next move really... is the courts. ",

            "text": "It is the courts.  As you said, all the interveners who are going to seek to intervene have done so.  The principal states have filed their briefs.  The respondent states the defendants have filed their briefs.  There have been amici, friends of the court, who have come in and filed their briefs in the case.  Texas has now filed a reply brief reasserting its position that remand to the legislature of the defendant states is the only viable option.  Whether the legislature sets a new election or provides some other mechanism to allocate a defendant state's electoral votes is up to the legislature.  That has been the core of Texas's argument.  Texas has not gone into anything other than saying, what the Constitution provides needed to be followed by the other states and was not.  Therefore, the electors that were chosen by these other states diluted the votes of the electors in Texas, and therefore the election of those defendant states' electors should be rescinded and they not be allowed to vote in the Electoral College and this not go back, not to courts, but to the legislature.

We've got to be clear on that.  We were yesterday, but you need to understand it does not select the president of the United States.  What the case does, it says, if the court were to rule in favor of Texas, they would simply say the case goes back to the legislature and to pick the 76 electors that are at play here.  That's what the case does.  It doesn't say Donald Trump is the winner or Joe Biden is the winner or Donald Trump's the loser and Joe Biden's the winner.  It doesn't say any of that.  So it's outcome determinative.  In other words, it could affect the outcome of the case, but really... It's really going to, if anything, if it goes in Texas' favor, which is an uphill climb, it goes back to the legislature.  Harry? ",

            "text": "Absolutely.  So the core deficiency attacked by Texas against the defendant states is that non-legislative actors effectively amended state law, state election law.  What does that mean?  It means that there were votes cast and counted which were not appropriate.  In essence, they were illegal votes.  And so at the ACLJ, we have consistently maintained that every legal vote should count.  And I think it is clear beyond question if you look at state after state, if you look at Georgia, if you look at Pennsylvania, if you look at Michigan and Wisconsin, non-legislative actors intervene without the permission or the ratification of the state legislative branch.
