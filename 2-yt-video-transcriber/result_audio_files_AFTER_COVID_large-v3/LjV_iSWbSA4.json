            "text": "Hey guys, welcome back to Clownfish TV.  This is Neon, and we're going to talk about ex-Rooster Teeth staffer Ryan Haywood.  He's coming back.  He's coming back to Twitch, and people are not happy about that.  If you remember, Ryan Haywood was accused of, well, grooming... A couple of months back and he got gone from Rooster Teeth along with Adam Kovic.  And now he's coming back.  He is coming back.  He is on Twitch.  Twitch did not ban his account.  Which is weird because Twitch bans people for Bless, frankly.  But, you know, whatever.  It is what it is.  We're going to talk about that.  This might be a spicy video.  So I'm giving you the heads up.  I'm giving you a content warning ahead of time.  So if you continue to listen, it's your own fault.  All right.  So before we get into it, guys, please subscribe for more pop culture.  News views and rants were over 168,000 subs.  Thank you so much for the support, guys.  2020 was very, very good to us in terms of YouTube.  Thank God, because something had to be good in 2020, right?  And 2021's off to a great start.  2020 was not good for Rooster Teeth.  They had a massive scandal.  Gonna backpedal a little bit here before we get into the latest with Ryan Haywood.  But just for those of you who don't remember, there was a scandal in the fall with a couple of Rooster Teeth staffers, their on-air personalities, Ryan Haywood and Adam Kovic.  And Ryan Haywood... As I understand it, seemed to be the more egregious of the two.  But he said he was going to take some time off to rebuild his family.  And that was that.  There were accusations that he was grooming fans.  That he was grooming fans.  According to HITC.com, Ryan had been caught up along with Adam Kovic in rumors surrounding lewd photos being leaked.  There were accusations from social media users that Ryan is the man in the leaked pictures, which people have speculated is the reason for his departure from Rooster Teeth.  It had not been confirmed, and apparently it has now.  Likewise, Adam Kovic has yet to address the speculation.  Again, he did.  Everybody did, and they got rid of these guys.  And he said he was going to take some time to heal his family.  Well, he didn't take a whole lot of time, because here we are, January, just a couple months later, and he's going to be on Twitch.  He has Sword of Malicious Gaming on Twitch.  He's got 133,000 followers on Twitch.  And this is coming from a, let's see, was it win.gg, which is an esports site.  I totally missed this.  You know, honestly, I thought this went down the memory hole when I'm talking about Rooster Teeth.  I'm more talking about the business side of Rooster Teeth and where they stand right now with WarnerMedia.  But this is pretty interesting.  So Rooster Teeth's Ryan Haywood plans Twitch return after accusations.  Again, guys, this might get spicy.  I'm giving you a warning.  Five, four, three, two, one.  Okay.  Accused groomer and sessual abuser Ryan Haywood is preparing to return to Twitch because the controversial streaming platform never actually banned his account despite an array of accusations made against him.  Was this proven?  Did he do some stuff he probably shouldn't have done?  Yeah, but there are a lot of girls coming out, women coming out, saying that it was pretty bad.  It was pretty bad.  I don't know.  I wasn't there.  I wasn't in the room.  I'm surprised it's Twitch and not OnlyFans, though, to be honest.  Once a member of Rooster Teeth, Heywood was fired after multiple accusations against him appeared online.  Many of the accusations include Heywood having explicit conversations with minors and then distributing their photos without clothing on.  Some of the victims even confessed that Heywood had done the deed with them, constituting, well, yeah, that thing.  That thing, underage relations.  Other women say that Heywood removed his dingle cover without their knowledge during the act, which is technically assault.  So he took the hat off the man.  Yeah, I don't know how else to say it.  Despite the accusations, many of which included screenshots, Twitch never banned Heywood's account on the streaming platform.  Currently has about 130,000 followers.  While the streaming community supported Heywood getting help and attempting to move on with his life, almost everyone has been in agreement that Heywood shouldn't be able to make money off of streaming, especially since it's the avenue he chose to initially find his victims.  Here we have Allison... sharing some screenshots, some pretty dirty screenshots.  This is from back in October.  All these news stories coming forward about Ryan just continue to drive a nail into my chest.  I know for a fact they're all true because a lot of what they're saying, at least the beginnings of their relationships with him, sound a lot like how he spoke to me.  This is her screenshots from 2017-2018.  And yeah, we've seen a lot of this.  We saw a lot of this on Reddit.  So he was flirting with a lot of girls.  Why is he?  Is he still married?  I don't know how that's going to go.  Flirting with a lot of girls, stealing the deal with a lot of girls, and taking the hat off the gentleman in some cases without them knowing it.  Holy shit.  Okay, so streaming community outraged at Heywood's possible return to Twitch.  Heywood's Twitch subs recently received a message in the new year from the former Rooster Teeth animator that explained his return to the platform.  He started off by saying 2020 was a bad year.  And it came to a really rough end.  Since then, Heywood has allegedly been picking up the pieces and figuring out what the next steps are.  Immediately jumping back into streaming, given the allegations, probably not the right next step, but that's just my personal opinion.  Heywood told his fans that he was doing better mentally, especially thanks to their support after he lost his career.  He ended up getting a new job, allowing him to pay for therapy and started pursuing various degrees.  For now, his focus is on fixing his life.  Twitch is not the place to fix anyone's life, dude.  I'm just saying.  While he stated he's not sure what the future of his Twitch channel is, the message made it seem like Heywood plans to return once he figured it out.  Keep you guys updated.  So here it is.  This is his message.  It's really weird writing this, and I honestly don't even know how to start.  I wanted to say thank you to all of you who are still subscribed.  A bad year came to a really rough end, and I spent the last few months picking up the pieces and figuring out what the next steps are.  Sucks to be you, right?  Sucks to be you.  Through all of it, having your support has been an incredible help for my mental health.  Not just the measure of financial stability you've given me after losing my job and career, but the emotional support it represents has meant so much to me in dark moments.  Especially that you gave it while hearing nothing back from me up until this point.  I'm still not sure what the future of the channel is.  I'm focusing my energy on rebuilding my family and life.  Some good news, though.  I'm doing better mentally.  And I'm in three different therapy programs to help with that.  Again... Good for you.  What about everybody else whose lives you tossed a hand grenade into?  I'm just putting it out there, right?  I got a job so at least I can pay for all the therapy and buy clothes since most of my wardrobe was work-based.  Wait, what?  which is all like free rooster teeth t-shirts and shit.  And because technical difficulties reminded me how much I like programming, I enrolled in some online courses to finish that CS degree.  I started way back in college before I swapped at the theater.  I'll keep you guys updated on what's going on.  That was part of trying to fix my life.  I won't be responding to direct messages on any platform.  No shit, that's probably not a good idea given the circumstances that led to you having to fix your life.  DMs are not a good thing for you.  Again, thank you so much, and I hope that 2021 leaves everyone in a much better place than 2020.  Not that it would have to try all that hard.  Yeah, we're off to a great start.  P.S.  P.S If you happen to be subscribed entirely by accident because you didn't remember to cancel me, then I'm totally that other streamer you love watching all the time.  I'm the dear, the dear person.  The women and girls that initially accused Heywood of assault and spreading their photos immediately felt mortified by Heywood's message.  One victim took to YouTube to explain why Heywood shouldn't be welcomed back to the platform.  She explained that she initially made a video about her experience to take away his platform, hoping he'd never have the chance to do what he did to other women.  Well, he's not DMing people, so I guess that's okay.  God.  But Heywood's announcement that he was considering streaming on Twitch again prompted this person, Tessa Graves, to make a second video addressing her traumatic experience and re-emphasize the original reason she kept sharing her story.  The whole reason we're doing anything is so he won't be able to do this again.  Don't let him re-establish himself on Twitch.  I don't care what he does.  I don't care how many therapy programs he's enrolled in.  He cannot be allowed to have an audience.  He cannot be allowed to hold power over people like he has in the past.  She stated Haywood has shown that he can't handle having a position of power since he will use his fame to abuse and manipulate people.  The majority of the Twitch community seemed to be in agreement with the victims.  Nobody had a problem with Haywood getting a new job or attending therapy.  This is complicated because I get what they're saying.  I think the guy personally, if he did what they're claiming he did, is a trash human.  But... You know, can you tell people they can't have a platform at all if they're trash people?  You know, I don't know.  That's sticky.  Well, God, no pun intended.  But, you know, Twitch is full of trash people anyway.  And I'm really surprised, given Twitch will ban you for having the wrong username, that they're okay with this.  I mean, Twitch is completely ridiculous when it comes to unevenly enforcing rules based on who feels what.  And the fact that his account is still up?  I have to tell you, I'm legitimately shocked that it is.  Many people were frustrated with Heywood's possible return.  More were angry with Twitch for never banning his account in the first place.  Ever since hundreds of streamers started getting accused of that thing and grooming and assault, Twitch was under fire for the poor handling of the ongoing situation.  The CEO himself was accused of not taking the allegations seriously, even laughing off such accusations in meetings.  So far, Twitch hasn't made any statements.  So they want to push Twitch into pushing Ryan Haywood off the platform, which... Twitch has, again, been pretty ridiculous lately.  They've been banning people from the platform for outside conduct, things that offended their moderators or whatever.  So I got to tell you, I'm a little surprised that they didn't do it.  Now, do I agree with them banning him?  No, not necessarily, because I think the guy is a trash human.  But, you know, if you ban him for that and he hasn't violated any actual Twitch terms of service, then that sets a precedent that you can ban people for anything, literally.  But they're already doing it.  You know, they really are.  You know, we know that Angry Joe was accused of stuff, you know, and Twitch hasn't taken any action.  And that's the thing.  If you ban Ryan Haywood... you know, have their charges been filed against Ryan Haywood?  I don't know if formal charges have been filed against them other than the guy's a complete creep.  You know, if you ban Ryan Haywood, then you have to ban a whole bunch of other people too.  Then Twitch is sort of, you know, Twitch is getting involved in your extracurricular activities at that point, but they kind of already are, but they also profit off of, you know, that sort of thing to some degree too, don't they?  At least as far as the ladies are concerned, they do.  Like I said, maybe Ryan Haywood would be more comfortable over on OnlyFans because some women, I'm going to be honest, and probably men too, probably find the idea of hooking up with Ryan Haywood, even after all the allegations, incredibly lucrative, you know, something that they would actually probably want to do, as disgusting as it sounds.  So I don't know.  This is just, it's very weird that, you know, he's popping up again so soon on streaming.  I guess you gotta make some money somehow.  He's not making it from rooster teeth.  But, you know, it sounds like a not good situation.  And his look, he hasn't lost a whole lot of subs either.  It looks like he's actually gaining them for sure.  So there we go.  I don't know, guys.  What do you think?  What are your thoughts on this?  What are your thoughts on it?  Let me know in the comments.  Surprised to hear about Heywood this quickly.  I'll talk to you later. ",
