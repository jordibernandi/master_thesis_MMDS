            "text": "Get back to work.  Focus on what you gotta do.  You shouldn't be that easy to distract you.  Get your ass back to work.  What's your name and your badge number?  First Amendment, you ever heard of it?  Stop it!  Stop it!  No, no, no.  I'm not stepping back up there.  No.  Yes, sir.  You can record all your... I know I can.  I don't need you to pay attention to your job.  What's your name and your badge number?  What's your name and your badge number?  Lauderhill PD 344.  I'm asking you to step up.  Okay, and I'm declining.  no because I'm not interfering.  I'm recording.  They know what I do.  I don't need your director.  And I'm telling you I don't need your director.  Get back to work.  Focus on what you got to do.  You shouldn't be that easy to distract.  Get your ass back to work.  Don't worry about where I can stand.  Don't worry about me.  You know I am?  I'm Big Nick on YouTube.  I record them.  Big Nick?  Yeah, what happened?  Okay, all right.  This is my homeboy.  Right.  He brought me up here to grab something.  So, on this side, if you're going to walk out, he's sitting in the car.  He's already been here.  So, obviously, okay, fine.  I can understand shit.  I didn't even realize there was a handicap.  So, let me stop you right there.  Let me stop you right there just for complete transparency.  That's probably the cause.  Oh, yes.  I understand that.  Get this.  Cop car pulls up.  You hear whoop whoop.  We all look out the window.  There's three motherfucking cop cars behind him all of a sudden.  Why?  For handicap parking?  Unfortunately.  I will record them.  I will continue to record them to make sure that they don't violate any rights.  However.  They went into the car and forced them out.  Yeah.  It's probable cause.  I'm sorry.  No, I understand.  I understand getting pulled over a big cop car behind you because you're in a handicap.  Right.  Did you ID?  Did you ID?  Did he ask you to say your name and stuff?  After he was already in the car.  You don't have to do that.  Well, I don't have it anyways.  Okay.  But you don't have to give him your information.  No.  No.  Oh, well, this white cop right here has it.  And he wasn't even part of it.  All of a sudden, he shows up and comes to me.  Listen, listen.  Stop being so fast to give your information to the government.  They've got criteria they have to follow.  You're protected by the Constitution.  You're protected by the Fourth Amendment.  The only time you're obligated to give your information to these people is when you're suspected of committing a crime.  Right?  That's the only time.  If you haven't committed a crime or about to commit a crime or in the process of committing a crime, you do not have to give your ID.  There's a statute, Florida Penal Code 901.151.  The only time you give your ID when you expect to commit a crime or about to commit a crime or in the process of committing a crime.  If you haven't done any of that, you can tell him.  I'm not giving you anything.  I was just standing right there.  He just tried to come bullet attack me.  He told me to move.  You see, he left before I did.  You got to know your rights.  You got to know the law.  They work for you.  You don't work for them.  All right?  But, yeah, unfortunately, whatever happened once they had probable cause.  Yeah, but that's the thing.  He pulled up and they were already there.  And they weren't following us.  I know, I know, I understand, I understand, I understand.  But he gave them a reason.  I'm sorry, but he did.  He gave them a reason.  Yeah, unfortunately, that's how they do it because that's why we need to defund them.  There's too many of them.  We don't need all this extra resources.  For traffic, I mean for parking violation.  Right.  Because he wasn't driving.  So what, he had a warrant?  Not that I know of.  So why did he take him in the drill?  Supposedly when he opened the door, after a good 10 minutes of looking at the tag, he smelled something in the car.  So smelling, smelling is not probable cause.  Mind you, mind you, he had the door closed, windows up.  Oh, which one, which one?  That one right there?  That black pot right there?  He got a license?  He has a license?  So you use smelling the marijuana as probable cause?  You know that's illegal.  The smell of marijuana is not probable cause.  It's a social vehicle.  And he knows that.  Swim knew that.  That's why he said they were taking his license.  Yeah.  Big niggas here now.  All these rights violations, if I catch their ass, they're going in.  Better be glad I wasn't here.  I would have been going to jail, too.  Yeah.  Yeah, once they're in custody, once they're in custody, they call the cops.  He was detained.  Y'all better than that lot of you.  You're better than that.  You should have been recording from the beginning.  Once you notice, come out and record.  Always.  They're going to steal the vehicle as well.  But really, he was parked in a handicapped spot, so at that point... I got you.  I'll post it.  The smell of marijuana is not probable cause.  I got it on camera.  I got it on camera.  I got it on camera because he's an asshole.  I got it on camera.  You could have let him say that number, man.  Man, you closed the door on that man, man.  That's nasty, man.  That's nasty, man.  Oh, my God.  I got it on camera.  I got it on camera.  I got it on camera.  Hold on.  Hey, they teach all that stance in the academy.  They teach all intimidation in the academy.  Clowns.  They teach all that intimidating stance in the academy.  How you doing, man?  I need to know that number again because I don't think I had the first three numbers right.  All right, so Big Nick, South Florida Accountability.  Hopefully the attorney will get the body cam footage because I did talk to the lady off camera a little bit more.  I did have the opportunity to speak with these officers.  I wasn't recording at the time, but it was a very cordial conversation.  and uh every cop isn't out to harm you.  some cops see the bull but again we have to understand the dynamics of their brotherhood and you know how they depend on each other in life threatening situations.  so you know we have to also have our own uh understanding of their psychology.  it doesn't mean that they're out to harm you as well but they do have to protect themselves.  and the most dangerous person to a cop is another cop.  i truly believe that.  um but Hopefully the attorney for the gentleman will be able to get the footage and see that there was no probable cause to search his vehicle.  The guy did have a license.  He dragged him out of the car.  Now, as far as the stop being legitimate, he was parked in a disabled parking spot.  So, you know, I can't dispute that.  And I did explain that to the young lady.  Hey, look, at this point, they have the right to detain him.  But as far as smelling marijuana and using that as probable cause to search his vehicle... That has been ruled upon.  That is no longer considered probable cause.  But hopefully his attorney will be able to see that on their body count or get their mission on my footage.  And hopefully that'll help him out.  So on behalf of the six, Big Nick South Florida Accountability.  Happy holidays, everyone.  Happy New Year.  Out.  70, bro, you're gonna be my YouTube star with me, man.  Because all you have to do is just shut your mouth and let me do what I do.  Big Nick.  Big Nick?  You don't look so big, bro.  Keep watching.  I'm a lot bigger than your little ass. ",
