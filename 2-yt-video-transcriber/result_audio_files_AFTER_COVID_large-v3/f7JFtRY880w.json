            "text": "hello there.  i'm lloyd evans and you're watching the john cedars channel from the bunker and in this video we must talk about the coronavirus specifically.  the question was the coronavirus predicted by jehovah's witnesses.  probably you saw the title to this video and your reaction was, that's completely preposterous, this title is just clickbait.  And I guess if I'm honest, it is sort of clickbaity, but at the same time, I have literally had people leaving me comments on my channel asking me to pursue this as a serious subject for a video.  So let's start with a comment from Ray Franz.  I was forwarded this article that is circulating among witnesses, which they give credit, JW, for predicting the coronavirus, even though the article says it's quoting a medical journal called Vaccine.  Here is the article.  So there's a link there to thenewsnigeria.com.  Another comment from JP.  Alert!  Lloyd, are you aware of the Facebook post being circulated concerning the 2005 awake that supposedly predicted the coronavirus 15 years ago?  OMG!  You have to do a video about this.  Joshua Pevey says, says Jehovah's Witnesses predicted the coronavirus in 2002 bit random but true.  and Isaac Rangel says do you know they had a prophecies and it's coming true right as we speak they predicted the coronavirus.  look it up.  you should make a video about it.  so several comments there viewers urging me in no uncertain language to make a video on this subject.  Now, the answer to the question has been kind of given in one of those comments, and I will return to that.  But before I really delve into this subject, it would perhaps be beneficial to take a broader look at what the coronavirus is.  With this in mind, earlier I spoke with someone who has been following the coronavirus very closely and has spoken extensively on the subject in recent weeks.  Here is what she had to say.  Thank you for joining me.  It must be said that you are not a recognised expert on the coronavirus or indeed medicine in general.  But you have, however, been speaking relentlessly on this subject for the past few weeks.  So what can you tell us about the coronavirus? ",

            "text": "So hopefully we've all learned a great deal there from this channel's resident expert on the coronavirus.  But we must return to the question at hand, namely, did Jehovah's Witnesses predict the coronavirus?  Well, the answer was already kind of given in one of those comments I read earlier from the viewer calling themselves Ray Franz.  He mentioned... that the quote-unquote prediction came from a medical journal.  That is absolutely true.  Now, I actually have the original print edition of the Awake magazine in question.  This is the December 22, 2005 Awake, titled The Next Global Epidemic When.  And this is the Awake magazine.  that's been quoted in a couple of articles that have popped up online, one of which is this msn news article which doesn't seem to have been particularly well researched or put together.  in fact i have to wonder how on earth this made it onto msn news.  is it really that easy to put together an article for msn news?  clearly it must be.  Nevertheless, when you actually look at this awake, when you read the quoted part of the article in context under the heading, could it come back?  It being a virus as deadly as the Spanish influenza, which took between 40 and 100 million lives in 1918, 1919.  It soon becomes apparent that if you want to call this a prediction it's certainly not a prediction that's made by the writers of Awake.  so let me read the whole thing in context.  according to many experts it is not a question of if such a vicious flu virus will return but of when and how it will return.  in fact some expect a significant new influenza outbreak every 11 years or so and a severe one approximately every 30 years.  According to these predictions mankind is overdue for another pandemic.  The medical journal Vaccine reported in 2003, quote, It has been 35 years since the last influenza pandemic and the longest interval between pandemics recorded with certainty is 39 years.  The article continued, The pandemic virus may emerge in China or a nearby country, and could include surface antigens or virulence factors derived from animal influenza viruses.  The vaccine article predicted concerning the virus, quote, Now the quote does go on, but I think we've made the point.  that even if you want to call this a prediction, and it's really talking more in terms of a hypothetical scenario in a medical journal.  Here's the website, by the way, for the Vaccine Medical Journal.  It seems to be a very kind of niche, professionals-only journal, not the sort of thing you'd necessarily pick up at your local, local news agents.  Nevertheless, it's not the awake writers who make this quote-unquote prediction.  It's a hypothetical scenario that's being put forward by a worldly medical journal using worldly knowledge that has been derived as a result of higher education being brought to bear by on the whole issue of pandemics and the potential for pandemics.  So hopefully that has satisfactorily put to bed the whole issue, for any Jehovah's Witnesses who may be watching, of whether or not the awake predicted pandemic the coronavirus.  but i did want to just touch on the whole kind of doomsday narrative that's circulating surrounding the coronavirus.  i'm sure there will be jehovah's witnesses who are pointing to it and saying ah well here you have proof that we're living in the last days because you have here a virus that's killing thousands and is likely to kill more thousands until it's finally brought under control, assuming it will ever be brought under control.  In the past, I think I've quoted from this book.  It's a fairly new book by Yuval Noah Harari called Homo Deus.  And I absolutely love the opening pages because what the writer does is he takes a number of different metrics such as warfare and disease and mortality and and he puts them in their proper perspective.  because it's very easy to take a single issue such as warfare or such as disease and without any kind of perspective Just make the assertion, oh, things are worse than ever.  And when you haven't had the benefit of living in past centuries, it's easy to get swept along by that sort of rhetoric.  But particularly in the area of disease, it simply cannot be said.  that we are living at a time where there is unparalleled carnage due to infectious diseases.  If you go back in time, you find that things were much, much worse before the advent of modern medicine, particularly.  one example that Mr.  Harari gives is when the first Europeans were setting foot in what they would term the New World, specifically Mexico.  The first Europeans wiped out millions when they first set foot in Mexico because they brought with them all sorts of diseases that the native population simply had no kind of resistance towards.  So if you're going to make the argument that things have never been worse in terms of diseases, I'm sorry, the facts just aren't on your side.  And if I can just quote a couple of excerpts from this book to you, on pages 12 and 13, it says... Every few years we are alarmed by the outbreak of some potential new plague such as SARS in 2002-2003, bird flu in 2005, swine flu in 2009-2010 and Ebola in 2014.  Yet thanks to efficient countermeasures these incidents have so far resulted in in a comparatively small number of victims.  SARS, for example, initially raised fears of a new black death, but eventually ended with the death of less than a thousand people worldwide.  The Ebola outbreak in West Africa seemed at first to spiral out of control, and on the 26th of September 2014, the World Health Organization described it as the most severe public health emergency seen in modern times.  Nevertheless, by early 2015 the epidemic had been reigned in, and in January 2016 the World Health Organization declared it over.  It infected 30,000 people, Killing 11,000 of them caused massive economic damage throughout West Africa and sent shockwaves of anxiety across the world, but it did not spread beyond West Africa, and its death toll was nowhere near the scale of the Spanish flu or the Mexican smallpox epidemic.  Smallpox was the disease that I was talking about when the first Europeans first set foot in Mexico.  And on page 14, Harari continues, despite the horrendous toll AIDS has taken, and despite the millions killed each year by long-established infectious diseases such as malaria, Epidemics are a far smaller threat to human health today than in previous millennia.  The vast majority of people die from non-infectious illnesses such as cancer and heart disease, or simply from old age.  so some words of reason and logic there which will hopefully be reassuring to those of you who are viewing the coronavirus outbreak perhaps through an apocalyptic doomsday lens.  it simply cannot be said that even as bad as the coronavirus is that it marks an apocalyptic sign of the end of the world or proof that the times that we're living in are worse than they have ever been in the world's history.  It simply isn't the case.  I don't know how many people the coronavirus is going to kill before it's brought under control.  What I do know, based on recent outbreaks, And based on the response of the medical community and how science has routinely stepped up to the plate, I know that this thing is not going to spiral out of control and it will be reined in at some point.  Will it manage to take as many lives with it as the tens of millions that the Spanish influenza took?  We'll have to wait and see.  But personally... I'm quite optimistic that science and medicine will come to the rescue.  That is not something that previous generations had at their disposal.  If you were a native Mexican when the first Europeans were setting foot on your soil, you were done for.  There was no medicine, there were no vaccines, there were no doctors who could really do anything meaningful.  other than just make you as comfortable as possible until you died.  So let's not have any of this apocalyptic talk, and certainly as regards this stupid claim that this Awake article predicted the coronavirus.  If any Jehovah's Witnesses come at you with that claim, just politely point out that even if you want to call it a prediction, it's not a prediction that was made by the awake writers.  It's a hypothetical scenario that was copied across from a quote-unquote worldly narrative.  medicine journal.  Anyway, that's pretty much all I've got for you.  I hope you have found this video interesting.  Don't forget to subscribe to the John Cedars channel for more such videos.  And as always, thank you for watching.  I don't know how I fell from the top of the world But it's finally over, finally over.  I've got to last one minute just to get out of life So I keep it together, thinking it's not forever. ",
