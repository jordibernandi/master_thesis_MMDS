            "text": "This is kind of morbid, but we're set to have the two oldest nominees in a US presidential election ever in Joe Biden and Donald Trump.  I wanted to take a look at what might happen if one of them became incapacitated or died.  Remember, on top of just being old, we also have the coronavirus, and because it's just riskier for older people.  So you've got sort of this double whammy.  So it seemed like, unfortunately, a pertinent topic, something we should be exploring.  So it depends greatly on when this happens.  Does something happen before the national convention for a party?  Does something happen after the convention, but before the election?  Or Or does something happen after the election, but pretty close after the election, so it might affect the electoral college vote?  So starting with the first scenario, before the convention, timing matters here.  If something were to happen to one of the candidates by, say, Memorial Day or something, particularly on the Democratic side, we still have a bunch of primaries to get through.  So if something happened to Joe Biden, you might see almost a reopening of the nomination fight for voters.  Like voters would go to the polls and be like, oh, well, actually, maybe I'm going to vote for Bernie Sanders or maybe I'm going to vote for Elizabeth Warren, assuming those candidates are still on the ballot.  And, you know, experts I talked to said at the end of the day, delegates are free to vote their conscience.  It's just that they usually vote for the candidate they're pledged to.  But there are also some other complications like state laws that in some cases bind delegates.  But all this could affect the eventual nominee.  Now, Something that's really important in this scenario is whether or not Biden has identified a vice presidential choice.  That might be someone that a lot of delegates turn to at a convention.  But at the same time, maybe they turn to Sanders.  So you can see an opportunity here for a real intra-party fight.  And really, the experts I spoke to talked about how really the more time there is from the election \u2013 the more opportunity there is for sort of personal ambition among candidates to fight for the nomination.  You know, sort of the closer you get to the election and some catastrophe happens, the more likely it is that no one's going to really want to engage in any sort of mischief or fight it out because it's just like the timeline is too pressing.  So anyway, that's what happens if something occurs before the convention.  Now, if something happens after the convention but before the election, the likelihood is that if something were to happen, the national party committees would do the choosing.  So on the Republican side, you have 168 members of the Republican National Committee.  three per state or territory.  And they would have the equivalent votes that the state or territory had at the convention in terms of delegates.  So Texas would have a ton of delegates and the Virgin Islands would have very few, for instance.  So they would sort of equal those votes and the committee would try to get a majority of delegate votes to back one particular candidate, which would probably be Mike Pence if something happened to President Trump.  On the Democratic side, they don't do the delegate equivalent thing.  Instead, you have 447 members of the Democratic National Committee and it takes a simple majority vote of those members to pick a replacement nominee.  This seems a little bit more straightforward, say, in early September or something, because there's some time before the election still.  What if something happens really close to Election Day, like October 30th, Halloween or something, on the 31st?  I mean, that's just not a lot of time between then and November 3rd, Election Day, to... for the committee to get together, pick a replacement.  The ballots have already been printed in all the states.  And because more states are using all-mail balloting, and obviously with our concerns about the coronavirus, there may be even more of that this time around than ever, it may be very difficult to change ballots.  So you might have even voters going to the polls not even really knowing who they're voting for, for one party.  I think, again, it's a little clearer on the Republican side that Pence would be sort of the natural person to be chosen as the replacement, whereas the Democratic side, there'd be a little more uncertainty.  But again, because the vice presidential nominee is there, that person would probably be the replacement choice.  So let's move to the final scenario here, which is if something happens to, I think importantly, the winning candidate just after the election, but before this individual has been inaugurated as our next president.  And that's where, again, timing matters.  And so if something happens \u2013 so the Electoral College meets in early December, mid-December, December 14th.  And states have until December 8th to figure out any confusion about who has won their Electoral College votes.  So let's say something happens to a candidate in mid-November, sort of in that period in between the election and when the electoral college actually gathers in each state in mid-December.  There is some murkiness here.  There's some uncertainty.  And it comes down to the fact that a lot of different states have laws that bind their electoral votes together.  or attempt to bind, I should say, their electoral votes to the ticket that won.  And so there's different wording in these states.  A majority of states basically have these laws that try to keep people from just doing their own thing as electors.  Some of them would seem to be flexible in terms of how those electors could vote in the sense that, oh, I'm supposed to back the candidate of my party.  So if you're the Democrats and something has happened to Biden and the National Committee has selected the vice presidential nominee to become the presidential nominee as a replacement, maybe in some states it would be straightforward, okay, I'm going to vote for that candidate now as president rather than as vice president.  But in some other states... It actually specifically says in their state statute that electors must vote for the candidates that were on the ballot.  So what happens then?  Obviously, you could see a real opportunity for a ton of litigation here.  And really, a lot of this hangs on the fact that we're not sure who the president-elect is in this situation.  The 20th Amendment to the United States Constitution... says that if something happens to the president-elect prior to inauguration, the vice president-elect shall become president.  But does that mean in that late November scenario before the Electoral College has voted?  Does that even count if the Electoral College has voted but Congress has not counted those votes yet, which they do on January 6th, 2021?  There's murkiness here because this stuff has never really been ruled upon.  And the National Archives site for the Electoral College even specifically says, we do not know what would happen.  basically, if a candidate dies or is incapacitated during this sort of murky post-election period.  So that, I think, really speaks to the uncertainty.  The courts would obviously become part of the discussion, probably.  And Even though we do actually have, I should mention, a couple past cases of candidates dying.  In both cases, it was a candidate who lost.  In other words, we've been lucky that no one has died after being nominated president or after even winning a presidential election.  And with the two oldest candidates we've ever had, in the midst of a health crisis because of coronavirus, which is particularly threatening to older people, you know, hopefully our luck doesn't run out this time around.
