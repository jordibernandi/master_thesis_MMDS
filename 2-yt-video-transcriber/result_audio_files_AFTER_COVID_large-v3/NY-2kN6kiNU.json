This afternoon, your former boss, Mr.  Morrison, is going to be sitting right where you're sitting, and he's going to testify.  And I want to give you a chance.  I think we're bringing you a copy.  I want to give you a chance to respond to some of the things Mr.  Morrison said in his deposition, page 82 of the transcript from Mr.  Morrison.  Mr.  Morrison said this.  I had concerns about Lieutenant Colonel Vindman's judgment.  Among the discussions I had with Dr.  Hill in the transition was our team, its strength, its weaknesses, and Fiona and others had raised concerns about Alex's judgment.  When Mr.  Morris was asked by Mr.  Castor, did anyone ever bring concerns to you that they believe Colonel Vindman may have leaked something, Mr.  Morrison replied, yes.  So your boss had concerns about your judgment.  Your former boss, Dr.  Hill, had concerns about your judgment.  Your colleagues had concerns about your judgment.  And your colleagues felt that there were times when you leaked information.  Any idea why they have those impressions, Colonel Vindman? ",

Alex is a top 1% military officer and the best Army officer I've ever worked with in my 15 years of government service.  He's brilliant, unflappable, and exercises excellent judgment.  I'm sorry, it was exemplary during numerous visits, so forth and so on, but I think you get the idea.  Mr.  Morrison, the data that was Yeah, let's see, I'm sorry.  July 13th.  So, Mr.  Jordan, I would say that I can't say what Mr.  Morrison, why Mr.  Morrison questioned my judgment.  We had only recently started working together.  He wasn't there very long, and we were just trying to figure out our relationship.  Maybe it was different cultures, military culture versus... ",

There was you.  the individual sitting beside you, Ms.  Williams, and then there, of course, was your boss, Mr.  Morrison, who I just read from his deposition.  When we asked Ms.  Williams, who she spoke to after the call about the call, she was willing to answer our questions, and Chairman Schiff allowed her to answer our questions.  When we asked Mr.  Morrison, who he spoke to after the call about the call, he was willing to answer our question, and Chairman Schiff allowed him to answer our question.  But when we asked you, You first told us three individuals at the NSC, your brother and the two lawyers.  And then you said there was a group of other people you communicated with, but you would only give us one individual in that group, Secretary Kent.  And the chairman would only allow you to give us that name.  When we asked you who else you communicated with, you would not tell us.  So I want to know first how many other people are in that group of people you communicated with outside the four individuals I just named. ",
