Stop being so weak.  I am sick to the back teeth of explaining that I make videos about what I want.  And if what I make hurts your feelings, when it was never about you specifically and I am just addressing arguments the exact same way I address all arguments, then acting like I kicked your dog because I mocked something you're into makes you a hypocrite.  And this aside, I have literally no time for you.  Grow up and have some fun at the silly bad idea person, who by the way is the one making you look bad, not me, along with all the rest of us.

And I am going to have to say the things I need to when they come up instead of waiting for him to finish.  Otherwise, you're going to end up listening to me solidly for like five minutes.  And no one wants that.  Least of all me.  So, right.  People change their opinions on things when they don't have a book and or group telling them that they must have those certain opinions or they aren't a real whatever it is.  and then they get out to the real world where these things are legal and they realize they don't hurt anyone or should be a choice or whatever.  yeah of course that happens.  it would be really weird if you left a religion but you had all the exact same opinions although i can see why you might think that Yeah, you left the religion, but you know our God is real.  still, though, right?  No, that's not how anything works. ",

But yeah, what people choose to do with their bodies for money is their business, and there's nothing inherently special or sacred or mystical about sex.  And no, but my book slash my god says X is not a compelling argument.  However, that people said that they hope their children don't save themselves till marriage?  What?  That sounds like a misquote or a cherry pick or, well, I'm just going to say doubt.  slash context, please.  Because A, who thinks about what their kids are doing in their bedrooms?  Well, apart from Christians, but normal people don't do that.  And B, who cares if a kid saves themselves for marriage or not?  Much like sex, marriage isn't sacred.  I know you think it is, but it ain't.  So it's a big whatever.  All anyone should want for their kid's sex life is to be happy, healthy, and safe.  Anything else is just creepy. ",
