            "text": "The 75-minute phone call further substantiates testimony heard during the extradition hearings that Assange was extremely careful during the redaction process of the State Department cables and exhausted all avenues to ensure that this material was released responsibly.  During the call, Assange warns Johnson that the file location to the State Department database archive was being circulated to minor media organizations by a rogue former WikiLeaks employee, Daniel Domscheit-Berg, who was suspended a year prior.  The file location would allow for access to the unredacted encrypted cables.  However, one would need the decryption key to access the file.  Now, a few months prior, in February of 2011, Guardian journalists Luke Harding and David Lee published this decryption key as a chapter title in a book.  They had also published the additional secret word.  Both the file location and the decryption key allow for anyone to access this material.  The Guardian, Der Spiegel, and The New York Times worked alongside WikiLeaks on the State Department cables, which is why Harding and Lee had access to this decryption key.  And because the file location was being spread to minor media organizations by this former rogue employee and the decryption key was already made public in the book, there was serious concerns that it was only a matter of time until the unredacted cables were published.  Assange and WikiLeaks were unable to change the file location and the decryption key because the file had been placed on BitTorrent sites by WikiLeaks in the past as a defense against denial of service attacks, and a password is not used for the website but for decrypting the actual file.  Assange was concerned that within a few days to a week, the full unredacted cables would be public, and so he contacted the State Department to ask them to assist in harm reduction measures. ",

            "text": "Meanwhile, Wikileaks was engaging in its own safety measures to slow down the publication of the unredacted cables.  24 hours prior to the phone call taking place, Wikileaks published 100,000 redacted cables to deter incentive for other organizations to publish and to also cause a distraction.  Wikileaks issued legal demands through German attorneys to encourage the former employee to desist.  However, WikiLeaks did not have legal standing because the cables are not owned by WikiLeaks, they are owned by the Department of State, and they would have to take legal action.  Assange also asked the German publication Freitag to obscure details when writing a story about the circulation of the file location and decryption key.  Additionally, Assange encouraged the State Department to inform those who have been in contact with the embassy, and he also asked that the State Department reintroduce measures that would prevent the release of the unredacted cables.  Assange suggested that an employee at the U.S.  Embassy in England could meet him in Norfolk so he could help provide the file location and decryption key instead of providing it over the phone, which was an unsecure network.  The State Department attorney, Cliff Johnson, said they will follow up and send someone to Assange's location.  However, this never happened.  The State Department did absolutely nothing after being notified by Julian Assange.  And eventually, the website Cryptome released the unredacted cables and was the first to publish this material, a fact they admit on their website.  Then Pirate Bay and other torrent sites began publishing the documents.  Julian Assange and WikiLeaks continued with their redaction program and slowly published the cables after they were released on other sites.  And despite reaching out to the State Department and spending many months going through the proper redaction process, Julian Assange is being prosecuted for the publication of these cables under the false claim that he was careless during the redaction process and put lives at risk.  During the extradition hearings and during whistleblower Chelsea Manning's trial, it was confirmed that there is no evidence to show that the publication led to anyone being harmed or killed.  The prosecution is based on a lie.  The truth is, it was Julian Assange who took extensive measures to ensure no one was harmed, and it was the US State Department that chose to do nothing, even after being warned.  And while the incarceration and politically motivated prosecution of Julian Assange continues, there have been additional calls on President Trump to drop the charges and pardon Assange.  UN expert Niels Melzer issued a letter to the president calling for a pardon where he reiterates his findings that Assange is a victim of psychological torture and that his health is declining.  In the letter, Melzer explains, I ask because you have vowed, Mr.  President, to pursue an agenda of fighting government corruption and misconduct And because allowing the prosecution of Mr.  Assange to continue would mean that, under your legacy, telling the truth about such corruption and misconduct has become a crime.  And to add to the list of public figures showing support for Assange, even former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin has come forward in support of the WikiLeaks founder in a video posted to YouTube.

And I've learned a lot since then.  And I think Julian did the right thing.  And Julian did us all a favor in America, did the world a favor by fighting for what he believed was right.  And ultimately, he's been proven to be right.  He deserves a pardon.  He deserves all of us to understand more about what he has done in the name of real journalism.  And that's getting to the bottom of issues that the public really needs to hear about and benefit from.  Yeah, some years ago, I publicly spoke out against Julian and I made a mistake.  Like I say, I've learned a lot since then.  I know that it's coming down to the wire and whether he's going to be pardoned or not.  I want more Americans to speak out on his behalf and to understand what it is that he has done and what has been done to him.  as he was working on the people's behalf to allow information to get to us so that we could make up our minds about different issues, about different people.  He did the right thing.  I support him.  And I hope that more and more people, especially as it comes down to the wire, will speak up in support of pardoning Julian.  God bless him. ",

Richard Bergen of the Labour Party issued a letter to the UK Ministry of Justice requesting a video meeting with the WikiLeaks founder.  An additional 16 MPs on all sides of the political spectrum have signed the letter, including Angus MacNeill, Jeremy Corbyn, David Davis, and Diane Abbott.  The letter comes after a group of parliamentarians met with Nils Melzer on the Assange case and were very concerned with Melzer's conclusion that Assange has been subjected to torture.  The letter states, quote, the case has important implications for press and publishing freedoms, end quote.  It also recognizes Assange's journalistic work with WikiLeaks exposing U.S.  war atrocities in Iraq and Afghanistan.  And in Germany, a group of MPs from all Democratic parties, including Angela Merkel's Conservative Party, have formed a parliamentary working group called Freedom for Julian Assange.  This joint initiative seeks to send a clear message of support for the free press, which is at risk due to Assange's possible extradition.  And in Assange's home country of Australia, MPs and senators have issued an open letter to President Trump to pardon Julian Assange or prevent the extradition.  In the appeal to the president, the letter ends with, by pardoning Assange, you would allow him to return to his home and his family for the first time in more than a decade.  People in positions of power are seeing this case for what it really is, an unprecedented attack on the First Amendment and a means to prevent other journalists from publishing information embarrassing to governments and institutions around the world.  Judge Vanessa Bracer will deliver her ruling on extradition on January 4th at the Old Bailey.
