            "text": "The Trump campaign just nuked the internet's sides from orbit.  Trump releases hilarious dank memes.  And political campaign ads that blow Biden out of the water.  And we're going to talk about them, folks.  And I feel like it's only right that we talk about this nuclear meaning, the dank maymays, as well as what Biden has in store.  And I got to tell you, Biden's memes are just not as dank or succulent as Trump's memes.  Hello, everyone.  This is Mr.  Obvious.  And today on the Internet, we're going to talk about Donald J.

            "text": "Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!  And now it's time for a short commercial break for our sponsor, Virtue Signal, the card game, who wanted to bring you this hilarious game.  I played it myself.  It is funny.  It is fun.  Virtue Signal, the game of social justice, is a card game parody of social justice activism.  In Virtue Signal, you basically play as one of 12 different social justice warriors.  The object of the game?  To collect as many NPC followers as you can.  The first person to reach 15 wins.  There is also an expansion pack that's available, but you can get everything for $34.98.  I recommend this game.  What are you talking about, Mr.  Obvious?  You know damn well your audience doesn't have any friends.  That's not true.  They've got friends.  Don't listen to him, folks.  If you're interested in the Virtue Signal card game, check out my referral link down below in the description.  Now that was one of the most interesting political campaigns that I've ever seen, and it was also deeply unsettling, kind of disturbing, but completely memorable and funny.  Now, I just want to explain this to you guys.  This ad is so effective that it's reached over 4 million people.  Now keep in mind, when I opened this ad earlier today, the video only had 3 million views.  This is going viral, this is blowing up, and this is on everybody's screens.  Now, why do I bring this up?  Why is this so important?  We know that Trump is spending some big, big ad dollars to buy the number one spots for advertising.  Well, there's that, that fact that his ads are going to be reaching more people, the American voters.  It's also the quality of the ad itself.  Is it no wonder that this ad is going viral?  And it's unlisted, meaning you can't even search for the video on YouTube or any other platform.  This is how successful this ad is.  Now, I want you to compare that to Joe Biden's campaign.  Here you can see on A Late Show with Colbert.  Joe Biden says this election year is the battle for the soul of the nation.  But we're calling it something else.  Hashtag Late Show Live.  Let's watch Biden.  Biden's, uh, hurts so bad.  I've never cringed so hard in my life.  While this video is not a official Biden campaign ad, I don't think that Biden's ads are very much better.  I mean, this video alone got 6,000 likes on Twitter and only 600,000 views.  And this meme, like this whole, you know, Avengers assemble and it's a bunch of people.  I don't know.  Biden is apparently... Who is Biden?  Doctor Strange?  Oh, well, that's fitting.  Then you have Ocasio-Cortez.  You have Bernie Sanders.  It just seems like they plastered random left-wing people on these heroes.  Barack is Iron Man, apparently.  And Trump is Thanos.  This ad really doesn't work on any level.  This ad is bad.  You know, it's often been said that the left can't meme, and I think it's pretty clear when you look at this.  And not only that, but Thanos was the badass character anti-hero that everybody liked from Marvel's Avenger.  Yeah, so, um, you're not making Trump look bad by making him Thanos.  You're making him seem epic.  Now, I'm going to show you some comments on 4chan of people reacting to this Biden meme.  Anonymous says, I can't believe this is real.  This is the cringiest thing that I've seen of 2020 so far.  Why do liberals have to relate everything to effing comic book?  movies.  Anonymous replies, they're adult children, Anon.  Anonymous replies, that is all they know.  Here you can see this tweet, and I warn you guys, you better take your cringe medications.  And while you're at it, remember to like, comment, and subscribe.  And hit the bell button for notifications for more content.  And of course, If you like this video, please consider giving it a share.  Now let's look at this screenshot.  Patrick asks, Tomlinson says, You watched a generation grow up on a diet of Harry Potter, Hunger Games, Marvel movies, and stripped away their hope, their jobs, their futures, and then backed the most cartoonish supervillain in the history for president.  And you're shocked that children are fighting back?  Dude, you're like 30 years old.  You're not a child.  It's absolutely and utterly cringe, but this is the world that these left-wingers live in.  Anonymous chimes in saying, they think they are in a movie.  FFS.  You know, I think it goes without saying that the left-wingers are absolutely cringetastic.  And this is a main problem with their campaign.  On the other hand, Trump's campaign is absolutely hilarious.  Everyone will remember this ad.  It's not forgettable.  You know, have you ever seen a political ad before?  It's like, Hi, I'm Ron Berger for Congress.  I promise to clean the streets of crime.  In 1990, I voted to take away women's rights.  Vote for me, Ronald Reagan.  And it's just like the most boring standard thing ever, you know?  It's completely forgettable.  You don't remember these political campaign ads.  You just forget about them because they're always, they're always like really, really normie, really safe, not funny at all, not memorable.  But this meme on the other hand, this political campaign ad is completely memorable because it's disturbing.  Anyone who sees this is not going to forget about it and they're going to remember.  Now, why is this so effective?  Why could this turn the tides of the election?  Well, it's simple.  I want you to compare this meme to the meme posted by Colbert.  The right-wing meme, not only is it actually dank and good, but it's very complex.  What do you mean?  it's complex?  Well, I'm going to show you.  We're going to analyze this, folks.  So, get ready.  Meme review.  And after this, you will be a meme master.  You too will be able to wield meme magic. ",

            "text": "And they basically just highlight all of the really disturbing things that Joe Biden has said.  Like, this isn't just some attention-getter meme.  It's exposing all of the flaws of Biden and questioning his cognitive ability to become President of the United States.  In other words, Donald J. Trump is implying heavily that Joe Biden is unfit.  But they have even more references than that.  The scene where Biden disappears and it becomes like a horror movie and then Biden starts appearing behind the guy like some sort of ghost.  Well, this is a famous image of Joe Biden sniffing a girl, except they cropped it out and they put it on this guy.  He's sniffing him.  So this is not only a reference to Biden's gaffes, not only a reference to his cognitive decline, it's a reference to Biden's creepy behavior and his missteps.  This is a complex meme, but here's the beauty of it.  You don't need me to explain it to understand it.  You just get it.  It just works, in the words of Tom Howard.  But on the other hand, compare this to the complexity of the left-wing meme.  What does it really mean?  The Democrats are Marvel Avengers?  They're the heroes.  Kamala Harris is the most unlikable one of them.  Isn't that hilarious?  They made Captain Marvel, a woman that literally everybody dislikes and thinks is lame.  Kamala Harris.  And I'm just like, wow, you know what?  That's fitting.  That's absolutely fitting.  But you're kind of you're kind of dunking on your own vice presidential candidate.  Right.  And, you know, they say, oh, well, Trump is Thanos.  Literally, the whole meaning of this so-called meme is that Democrats good, orange man bad.  There's no complexity.  There's no nuance.  There's no beauty.  It's not dank.  It's honestly just cringe.  And that's the difference, folks.  You see, this video has gotten lots of dislikes, but you can see that there's more likes than dislikes.  And, you know, when I see this, I can't help but wonder, could this reflect the presidential election?  Trump has the edge.  Could this be like a sort of sample size of votes?  I mean, who knows?  Probably not.  But it's interesting to think about.  The thing about this is that it's absolutely hilarious.  Even people who aren't political think the ad is good.  Padme Amidala says, personally, I don't like either of them.  But damn, this is hilarious.  So what does it tell you when people who don't even follow politics love this ad?  It tells you that the ad works.  The meme is dank.  The right has the may-mays.  The left can't meme.  And this is a big problem for Joe Biden because it means he's not going to be able to reach the youth, the millennials and zoomers who could potentially vote in the election.  Zombie L says, The first time in my life I've wanted to watch a political ad.  Is this going to be the political Super Bowl?  Maybe if there was only one team.  Yeah, I think that the Biden campaign is absolutely no match for Trump.  Ecom says this is the best political attack ad I've ever seen in my life.  And there you have it.  That's pretty much the story.  My sides have been nuked from orbit, but that's merely the obvious.  Well, that's all for now, folks.  What do you think about this story?
