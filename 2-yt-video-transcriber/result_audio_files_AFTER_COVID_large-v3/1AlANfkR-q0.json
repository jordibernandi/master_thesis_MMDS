Trump 2020 landslide, even with everything going on with COVID.  I think that's what we can expect.  I wouldn't be surprised at all if Trump had a 49 state landslide.  I think we could see a 49 state landslide.  We may be looking at a Mondale Reagan type scenario where Trump landslides 49 states and we may see a 49 state landslide.  maybe a 50 state landslide.  That'd be amazing.  I think we might be seeing a 49 state landslide.  I just really think it's more likely that Trump wins 520 electoral votes.  No amount of mail-in ballots will matter if Trump gets 537 or 36 or even 538, every single electoral vote.  We all know Joe Biden will lose.  Like, let's be real, man.  As I've stated a million and one times, Donald Trump's going to win.  The Republicans are going to sweep.  Ladies and gentlemen, Joe Biden has defeated Donald Trump.  You are the silent majority and you voted for Biden.  Thank you. ",
