            "text": "In countries like America, Canada, Britain, Sweden, and Germany, it is now very common to see politicians and media personalities casually denounce and demonize all European people.  They also make blanket denunciations of Christians and heterosexual people.  This has become absolutely trendy in America, making casual statements dehumanizing all straight white men or old white men or straight white Christians.  is met with applause and laughter in the U.S.  media and left-wing social circles.  Well, it seems that a lot of Hungarians want no part of this taking root in their nation.  Recently, there was a big protest against a Hungarian mayor for doing this.  Peter Niederm\u00fcller is the newly elected mayor of the 7th district of Budapest.  He represents the Democratic Coalition, or DK.  This party was founded in 2010 as a splinter group of the Hungarian Socialist Party.  DK is currently the largest opposition party to the Fidesz-KDNP alliance, and Niederm\u00fcller is one of the party's three vice presidents.  Niederm\u00fcller is also a former member of the European Parliament, where he was vice president of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats.  He had a sort of unusual role.  A lot of the parties in the S&D are becoming increasingly pro-Palestinian, and now some are even engaging in agitation against Israel.  Of course, the reason for this is so.  Muslim immigrants will continue voting for their parties.  So, Niederm\u00fcller, who is Jewish himself, was a point man for denying that the S&D had any taint of anti-Semitism.  while at the same time accusing rival parties of being secret anti-Semites.  For example, he once denounced Sebastian Kurz and Heinz Christian Stracke for scheduling an EU summit on a Jewish holiday.  He claimed that this was an intentional act of hostility against the Jewish people.  So, he is a man with a clear history of casually using incendiary rhetoric to attempt to dehumanize his political enemies.  Recently, Niederm\u00fcller was on a TV station called ATV.  This is a private station owned by a Pentecost megachurch in Budapest.  ATV is known for its support of the left-wing opposition to Fidesz.  Niederm\u00fcller said the Hungarian government's concept of the family was the same as that of, quote, white nationalism.  He said the government's policies would exclude people and leave a, quote, frightening formation left in the middle, white Christian heterosexual men and the women among them.  Well, this is exactly the kind of nasty remarks about white people and Christians that have become commonplace in much of the West.  However, a lot of Hungarians did not take it sitting down.  On Thursday evening, thousands of people protested Niederm\u00fcller in front of his office.  The Conference of Catholic Bishops in Hungary made an official statement condemning the remarks.  They called on DK and ATV both to denounce the remarks and for all parties to respect ethical norms.  Now, DK is simply brushing everything off and saying the protests are partisan motivated.  However, I find it nice to see that at least somewhere in the world, people are denouncing this kind of casual demonizing of straight white Christian males.  Meanwhile, the saga with Viktor Orban and the EPP is still playing out.  The former prime minister of Slovakia, Mikul\u00e1\u0161 de \u017dirinda, published an open letter to Orb\u00e1n.  He said he respects his opinions and his stances, but said issues like migration and climate change will not be saved by national conservative slogans, but through European-wide solutions.  He also criticized Orban for becoming too close to Matteo Salvini.  He did, however, invite Orban to attend a high-level meeting on immigration that will take place in Athens on April 2nd.  Orban made an official statement saying that he would attend the meeting.  All right, thanks for watching this video.
