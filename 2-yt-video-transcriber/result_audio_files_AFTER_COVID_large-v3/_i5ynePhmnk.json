            "text": "Thank you.  Like Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton, you've been a consistent supporter of military intervention in the Middle East from the Iraq War to the Libyan War to the Syrian Civil War.  Some on your side of the aisle, including the president-elect, have said, well, we were given bad intelligence.  They misled us on the intelligence on Iraq.  That's a very specific reason.  There's probably some truth to it.  But I think it misses sort of the lesson of the Iraq war.  Likewise, your justification for maybe coming to a new approach on the Libyan civil war is, well, maybe we overestimated the idea of having viable successors there.  To me, it seems like we're still missing the point, because even after Libya, you guys went on to Syria wanting to do the same thing again, and you've argued, well, maybe we just didn't do enough.  If we'd done more, we could have toppled Assad, and we could have had real regime change in Syria.  Well, you got it in Iraq, you got it in Libya, and it's a disaster.  The lesson of these wars is that regime change doesn't work.  People say, well, we're gonna get rid of the Iron Fist, and Thomas Jefferson's going to arise from the ashes.  Well, that, you know, is a naive notion to believe that Thomas Jefferson or his like live in Libya or live in Iraq.  Their tradition is so much different than ours.  I mean, we've been fighting against centralized power in the English tradition for a thousand years.  The revolution in England was 350 years ago.  Ours was 250 years ago.  That tradition they don't have.  They have a tribal existence.  You trade one for another.  But mostly what you've gotten through the policies you have advocated, and Joe Biden has advocated, and frankly, John Bolton has advocated, this idea of regime change has been a disaster for the Middle East.  We complain, everybody around here is concerned, Iran, Iran, Iran.  Well, why is Iran stronger?  Who's their best friend in the region now?  Iraq.  You know, we did that.  We had a balance of power.  It wasn't perfect, but we had somewhat of a balance of power in the Middle East.  And you guys messed it up.  You got rid of the one bad guy and another bad guy got stronger.  And so then you went to Libya and did the same thing.  And they said, well, maybe Libya is a one-off.  Well, maybe there's a rule here.  Maybe there's something we can learn about regime change.  And maybe... we can learn that humility would be that maybe we shouldn't be choosing every government in the Middle East.  I would argue that instead of always choosing the governments, maybe we should not reward the bad ones.  You know what I mean?  So for example, with Saudi Arabia, I despise the regime, I'd probably still trade with them.  I probably wouldn't cut them off completely.  I wouldn't sell many more arms.  And after they killed Khashoggi, they shouldn't have got one bit of our armaments.  But both sides advocate for this.  On UAE, we tried to stop that because UAE has a terrible human rights record.  Both sides support it.  The problem around here is we have bipartisan consensus.  The problem isn't lack of consensus.  The problem is too much consensus.  But the consensus is for regime change.  Are any of the lessons you've learned from the failure of Iraq war, Libyan war, the chaos, the vacuum, and more terrorism that occurred and more lives that were lost, and then to go on to Syria, I don't get that there's been a lesson learned.  Is there any kind of lesson learned on your part that regime change may not be the best thing for us in the Middle East? ",

I'm proud of the fact that I have spent all of my career during the times I've been in government for the better part of 25 years, working to advance our diplomacy, to do everything we possibly can to make sure that diplomacy is the first answer, not the last answer, and that war and conflict is a last resort.

            "text": "In Syria, there was a predictable result there.  Had you gotten rid of Assad, who were the fiercest fighters over there?  al-Nusra and al-Qaeda.  The more radical you were, the better fighters you were.  The program that you started with Hillary Clinton, the program to train the moderate rebels, We spent 250 million, we trained about 60.  We sent 10 of them into battle, and they were captured in the first 10 minutes.  It was a complete disaster.  This whole idea that there were moderates over there that we were gonna support, doctors and lawyers and stuff, there were, but I don't think they were out there fighting.  The ones out there fighting were jihadists, al-Qaeda, al-Nusra, and if they had taken over the country, Assad's a terrible person, but I'm not positive that these people would have been better.  So it means the same lesson.  Our humility has to be let's quit toppling regimes over there.  Let's don't support the bad ones, but let's don't presume enough that if we topple them that in the vacuum Thomas Jefferson is going to arise because it never seems to happen.  With regard to advise and consent.  And this is a little bit on Senator Barrasso's extension of his question on treaties.  It really isn't so much a solicitous mood to say, well, we just can't pass these treaties.  We're going to make all these agreements.  They're not coming to you.  But I would argue even more importantly on war.  You have argued when you've been part of administrations that, oh, yes, you know, we'd like like Senator Kaine's a more narrow AUMF, but we don't really need it.  And you're not alone.  That sort of, I think, arrogant executive sort of attitude comes from both parties, every president for the last 50 years.  In fact, they all probably believe this.  They believe they have absolute power.  It's called this absolute Article II authority.  And this runs on both sides.  But it runs through the extremes on our side.  The John Boltons on our side believe in this absolute Article II authority.  The AUMF from 9-11 had nothing to do with people in Somalia.  Do you think the AUMF from 9-11 authorizes you to continue the war in Somalia? ",

That's somebody dreamed that up later and sort of said that it's in.  It's not in there.  It doesn't say associated forces.  There is no authorization for war in Somalia, Mali, Yemen, which the Obama administration originally did support.  So there really isn't.  I'm not for a more narrow one.  I'm just for no more war over there.  I'm tired of all the war.  I'm tired of all the nation building.  Look, I love the rights of women as much as anybody.  But if our goal is going to be that we're going to keep women in power, like in Saudi Arabia, we're going to go to war with Saudi Arabia because they don't have women ministers of health and stuff.  You know, it really isn't exactly our national security that you're talking about.  You're talking about something different.  Now, from the point of view of the Secretary of State, there are things you can do through soft power to advocate for the principles we believe in.  But overthrowing governments to instill women's rights or to continue women's rights is And to continue a military presence there and fight battles for it is really not something that is in the purview of the Secretary of State or really under the Constitution to anyone in our government.  With regard to NATO, you've advocated for expanding NATO.  Do you still support putting Georgia in NATO? ",

            "text": "We were talking about 20 years ago.  We might have a valid argument now.  Russia occupies Georgia.  Russia occupies or proxy troops occupy part of Ukraine.  So I think adding either of them to NATO not only is provocative, but you'd have to think what comes next.  I mean, if we're obligated to defend our NATO allies, I mean, basically we'd be voting for war.  So I wouldn't vote to add Georgia to NATO, not on your life, unless I'm ready to send my kids and your kids to go fight in Georgia.  You know, the complicated fights and wars and occupation around.  And I just think that we need to think these things through.  And I think for every provocation, there's a response as well.  So we can't look at it in a vacuum.  People say, I don't care what Russia thinks.  I don't care what Tehran thinks.  Well, if we don't understand our adversaries enough to think how they will respond, then I don't think we're doing our job.  I agree with you.  But as you can tell, I'm not excited about more military intervention in the Middle East.  I think there has been some chastening on the part of the incoming administration over previous failures.  But I don't think you have completely gotten the idea that regime change has been a terrible disaster.  It's created vacuums, chaos, and actually more terrorism throughout the region.  So I hope you will consider that.  It's important.  not just for the philosophic point, but it's important for our kids.  I mean, we're sending these kids over to fight in these wars that go on forever and ever and ever, and somebody's got to stand up.
