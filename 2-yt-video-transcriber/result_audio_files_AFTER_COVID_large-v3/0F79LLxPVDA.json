It's called Timeline Science, Analysis of a Regressed Timeline, by StellanTV, who, those of you who've been around a while will remember, is the guy who thinks that we're actually living in the 23rd century, and is very confused as to why we still cook with fire instead of cooking everything in the microwave, which is clearly a far superior and more futuristic technology.  Now, I haven't watched this whole video.  I thought we could explore it together.  But from what I gather, this is his attempt to lay out his entire regress timeline theory.  Because he has a lot of videos talking about this, but I don't know that there's one video where he explains it all concisely in one place so that people can understand what he's talking about.  I know I have definitely had a lot of trouble in the responses that I made to him before trying to understand exactly what he was trying to say.  So it's probably a good idea.  So let's learn together. ",

If time is just one arbitrary dimension in spacetime, I'm not quite sure exactly how true that is.  But just for the sake of argument and for the sake of getting through this video, we'll accept that that's how it works.  There's no need to get all philosophical about it, I guess.  For the moment, I'm not really concerned if you're right or wrong, I'm more concerned about what you think.  I want to understand your idea.  And so yeah, when you said that, I thought you meant, an event happens, and so the things that happen in the future will be affected by that event.  It will change the future.  The confusing part is, you drew it veering off to the side, and then you said it's like a beam of light, presumably passing through a prism or something else that bends it.  Like, as if when you say that the event affects the timeline, you don't mean it just changes future events, you mean it changes the direction of the timeline?

So how is consciousness tied to a timeline and to a timeline flowing?  Well, the first thing that jumps into my head is the idea that the flow of time isn't really a thing as such.  Like, the way that we distinguish past from future is that in one direction entropy increases, and that's the future.  But that feeling that time is ticking away, that it's flowing past, that a moment occurs and then it's gone, and then the next moment occurs and then it's gone, is a product of the brain's perception of things, not something innately real about time itself.  If you want to associate consciousness with time, that's one way that I could see for you to do it.  So maybe that's what you mean.  I'm going to try to listen to this through that context and just see if it sounds like that's what you mean. ",

As if events don't happen at every single moment of every single day.  It does seem like you have different events affecting the timeline to different degrees.  No pun intended.  Actually, pun intended.  But what makes an event more or less severely affect the timeline?  Well, if consciousness is what's actually affecting the timeline, and consciousness is light, then does turning on a light bulb affect the timeline?  Or is it only thought light that affects it?  If you have an event that's brighter, does that affect it more?  Or if you think brighter, does that affect it more?

Seriously?  Literally every event ever?  How do you even decide what constitutes an event?  Like, the Renaissance, that's not just an event, that's thousands, millions, billions, trillions, googolplexes of events that people have just kind of stuffed into one category.  What makes that actually an event that has a physical effect on time?  How on earth could you make these determinations objectively?  And if you could, how could you manage to even calculate this?  And number two, your entire graph here is exceptionally confusing.  I mean, what it looks like is that you have 0 BC at the origin, and then the y-axis represents different years, but for some reason you drew the labels on the other side of the graph, and then you drew an arrow from 0 BC to 2200 AD, which, if you'd drawn those labels on the correct side of the graph, would have just been a straight line up.  Point being, the only real information on this graph right now is that 2220 is a bigger number than 2020.  As for what the x-axis represents, I have no idea.  You didn't label anything there.
