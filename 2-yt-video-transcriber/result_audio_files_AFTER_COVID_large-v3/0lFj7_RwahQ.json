            "text": "Can I give you a hug, sir?  Yes, of course you can.  She's not concerned.  Exactly.  She's not concerned.  We're not concerned about an invisible... You want a hug, officer?  No, I do not, sir.  Why not?  Please maintain social distancing.  Okay, you have a good day.  Okay, now you need to hang about, sir.  Why?  Because you've clearly just been engaging with people who are not in the same household.  Okay.  Well, I'm recording you, officer.  And I'm recording as well.  Okay, good.  You can see the... The red light going round and round on my camera.  That means that I'm recording.  This is just evidence to you, going up to people.  Do you know these people?  You do know them?  They're human beings, like me.  They're not mine.  They're not mine.  They're happy.  They're not hurt.  Who's been hurt?  Who's been hurt?  Who's been hurt by my actions?  You?  An officer of the government?  There's God.  wow people are being arrested and thrown away for the crime of not social distancing which of course will automatically force them not to social distance.  the logic here is absolutely insane and whether you agree with the man or not everything he did was voluntary and everything the state is doing is extremely dangerous.  welcome back beautiful and amazing human beings.  this is a lot of important issues to get into especially with january 6th approaching and many questions still left aside to now not just if but when donald trump and the gop will try to delay the certification of the presidential election as well as more crazy news coming out of china with new information confirming everything we've been telling you from the beginning of this.  again absolutely ridiculous.  how many times we've called ... something out and then it later is confirmed a month by of ... course the mainstream media.  there's also a billionaire ... missing in China.  we're going to get into that plus a lot ... more all on this independent media outlet that doesn't like ... people getting arrested for voluntary no private party ... injured.  events like consensually hugging people.  and I'm sorry but arresting people because they didn't ... meet in a bubble is just absolutely insane or I guess it ... just might be the new normal as police officers worldwide ... are criminalizing actions as such just like we saw in ... Barcelona where 300 people had money stolen from them by the ... state due to threat of force because they went to a raver ... had to be deployed to make sure they didn't escape making ... sure they don't go.  they of course didn't social distance ... as they were giving their fines.  that's just a little bit ... ridiculous but before moving on.  but before we get into that ... plus a lot more.  on a personal note I have.  A new pooper.  Whether her name is going to be Marley, Bubba, Anarka, I don't know.  I'm picking right now the name of my incredible apocalypse survival beast.  Say hi.  What an incredible dog.  I of course will be extorting her to ... the fullest extent on my Instagram.  so if you want to ... follow and check out more amazing dog posts which will ... predominantly now dominate my Instagram feed.  check out ... Instagram.  Luke we are change.  Now when the government isn't hugging you with force ... punishing you physically and throwing you into a cage ... where you won't be social distancing all for the crime ... of not social distancing.  they're also in the United ... States just taxing you so they could send it to the ... rest of the world for absolutely ridiculous and strange reasons.  is there ever an instance where another country tax its ... citizens to give it to the United States.  No but it happens here in the good old United States which ... looks like it's also priming itself for an extraterrestrial ... revelation.  whether a psyop or not it's happening.  it's here.  With the latest event of course unfolding in Hawaii where ... many people including the FAA were notified of a large blue ... UFO unidentified flying object spotted flying in the sky.  And then jumping into the water which is interesting ... because this is also what former US Naval intelligence ... officer William Cooper said before all the way back in the ... 1990s describing very similar actions.  now whatever is happening definitely expect more of this to be the norm in 2021 as even a harvard professor just recently came out and it's claiming now that more aliens are coming after personally saying that they were here already in 2017. now whether real fake contrived used as a psyop we still do not know.  there's a lot of information.  there's a lot of evidence that we're not report that's going to be released in June of this year ... specifically from all the intelligence agencies ... specifically about aliens which of course we're going to ... be keeping a very close eye on and reporting to you as ... honestly as we can which we could only do mainly because of ... your support and if it wasn't for your support puppy ... wouldn't have any food to eat.  okay I'm joking I'm being ... facetious here please.  I'm not going to exploit that ... puppy that much but if you want the puppy to have a good life.  You will support us on wearechange.org.  forward slash donate.

This is of course happening right after Mitch McConnell asked the GOP not to do this.  And of course 12 senators didn't listen to the ... turtle man that believes Pakistan should have gender ... studies but you should not have $2000.  hey hey you get the ... truth here on this channel.  you shouldn't expect anything ... else.  now as this is happening we are also ... getting news that US President Donald Trump is joining.  call urging state legislators to review quote evidence surrounding this year's election and to quote consider to decertify it as unlawful.  now it's very interesting is even seeing support from vice president mike pence who has previously been at odds with donald trump about this very specific issue.  if you remember on election day this year it was donald trump saying stop the vote.  same event saying don't worry every vote will be counted so ... there have been many contradictions between ... Donald Trump and of course the sitting vice president ... some Trump loyalists have even gone as far as to attack ... the vice president for not being fully in support of ... this.  but it looks when it comes to this instance of the ... GOP trying to block the certification of Biden's ... victory it looks like.  of course he is welcoming it now ... will this have any kind of actual real-life consequences?  ... derail or stop a Biden victory?  well according to ... Trump's top lawyer there is a possibility here but ... according to the majority of the kind of established ... thinking.  no that is not the case here.  now it is important ... historically in our political system in the United States ... there were two incidences of trying to block ... have failed previously before but it looks like some ... establishment.  mainstream media publications are ... taking this threat seriously going even as far as to label ... some of these GOP senators making a stand on January 6th ... calling them traitors.  Mitt Romney a person who loves the ... taste of a boot says that this contention is quote ... dangerously threatening our democracy.  and again we don't live under a democracy but we're seeing the lines being drawn here.  Donald Trump has called for a lot of people to show up on Washington DC this 6th as well.  what's going to lead up to everything?  what's going to happen?  I predict?  I say I have no clue because I don't have a magic eight ball and whoever is pretending to tell you that they know exactly what's going to happen happen here for those people are usually full of who we ... some people say nothing will happen and overall that's the ... major kind of consensus here but you never know especially ... with how crazy things are politically in what some ... people are describing a dog and pony show for the sheeple ... and I asked my Twitter followers what they think was ... going to happen.  I got this very interesting gift and ... overall some people just saying nothing.  so yeah there's ... that also in the second story.  we of course now have to be ... canholio sickness not just the regular canholio sickness.  now ... we have the super version of it as of course we are hearing ... reports of a new strain of the canholio sickness which if ... you remember we've been hearing about different ... strains of the sickness ever since April.  so there's that to ... chew on.  and now according to some scientists reexamining 2 ... million tests they believe that this quote super ... strain sickness could have already been here in the ... United States since October.  and when it comes to these ... tests it's also important to note here that some Italian ... doctors literally constructed live demonstrations.  With these tests on kiwifruit which according to this video ... in Italy shows it testing positive for the cannula.  Sickness now how did that.  How did that happen?  something of course that we should be asking a lot of serious questions about that.  we still don't know the answers from such as who is patient zero.  where is the origin of this entire sickness and why are countries like China blocking any efforts to find out anything about that.  information that would help tackle this sickness.  but now ... we're getting more bombshell information something that ... we've been saying from the very beginning ever since we ... realized that there was a level 4 laboratory in Wuhan ... that was doing dangerous gain-of-function studies ... specifically around bats.  that was previously financed by Dr.  Fauci.  Yes, Dr.  Fauci funneled millions of dollars into ... the level 4 Wuhan laboratory that was working on extremely ... dangerous and risky gain-of-function ... conholial sickness bat strains.  That is an absolute fact.  here and now we're getting ... information from Donald Trump's Deputy National ... Security Advisor Matthew Pottinger that is suggesting ... the most credible source of this sickness came from that laboratory.  Now he doesn't go on to explain whether this was done by ... accident or on purpose but he says information the US ... government obtained from Wuhan.  scientists turned ... whistleblowers helped confirm this and again we have to ... remember if people said that this just a few months ago they ... would be permanently banned and deleted off of social media ... now we're getting government confirmation that again ... because this happened previously before.  this is most likely the case.  and it would explain the Chinese government's efforts ... towards censoring information about it.  now let's just say ... hypothetically if the Chinese government knows the origin the ... specific strain how this sickness was created they ... could have an easier time dealing with it.  then of course ... the rest of the world that is still starting off from a basis ... point of view that they don't know where the sickness came ... could explain why China is now fully open without a jab and in ... many places.  no mask mandates no social distancing mandates ... and their economies are the only ones in the world that ... are not in the red that are thriving and they're doing ... good.  now another possible hypotheses here is that China ... could be lying and covering up the deaths of.  Millions of people within its population.  and understanding China's history that could also be ... the case.  again we don't know exactly what's happening in ... China because China is of course hiding a lot of its ... information from the general public.  journalists who ... reveal information that could help people that could ... help the world are literally jailed and disappeared in ... China right now as we're speaking especially if they go against the government's ... narrative in China just like we recently saw Jack Ma do ... and now he's been mysteriously missing for over ... 2 months.  yes Jack Ma after criticizing the Chinese ... government for running a central bank for having tough ... regulations for restricting the free flow of capital just ... like any entrepreneur detests and doesn't like comments ... which of course the president Xi Jinping didn't like ... since of course they were anti-government anti-regulation ... anti-prevailing narrative and logic of the state which of ... course ideology is more important than merit.  and now ... literally he's been.  he's been missing from the public for ... two months.  he's even been removed from his own reality ... TV show and even the judging website that goes along with it.  that's the state that many american elites are literally prompting up in china and are in favor.  for when you look at the rise of china it directly correlates with the u.s establishment the higher echelons of the united states propping them up.  if we weren't propping them up they wouldn't be as powerful as they are.  and now they're ... setting the stage for the ultimate betrayal and talking ... to individuals like China uncensored made me realize ... that if the United States pulled the plug.  it's not too ... late but if the United States establishment elites ... pulled the plug on China they wouldn't be as powerful ... and as prevalent as they are.  they wouldn't threaten ... American hegemony.  but yet they still do.  and here we are today.  Now that's my particular take on it.  if you think I was ... wrong in any instance or way or if you think I got ... something incorrect just let me know what in the comment ... section below.  I love constructive criticism.  I ... don't always get it right.  I'm a human being.  I make ... mistakes just like everyone else does and that's why I ... Don't look up to me.
