            "text": "Everybody's got a price for the Democratic Party.  Coming to paperback and e-readers this March, John Haynes, the man with nothing to lose.  The man who rules the world runs into the irresistible force of a man with nothing to lose in this action-packed, all-new John Haynes series adventure.  Get the regular and varied cover editions of John Haynes, the man with nothing to lose this March.  Chuck D, the legendary MC of the rap group Public Enemy, has decided to kick his hype man Flavor Flav out of the group for sending a cease and desist letter to Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders for using their iconic slogan of their 1989 song, Fight the Power, in a poster for a rally he was holding at the Los Angeles Convention Center.  Now, when I take a critical examination of of this situation where your Chuck D has kicked your Flavor Flav out of the group.  I find it to be quite comical because when you consider Flavor Flav's behavior in the past.  Now, in the past, your Flavor Flav has participated in a minstrel show known as Flavor of Love where women were fighting for his attention and his affection.  And on that show, Your Flavor Flav was flirting heavily with Brigitte Nielsen, a white woman.  And when you consider the group Public Enemy and what it stood for, what Your Flavor Flav was doing on the Flavor of Love show was diametrically opposed to everything the rap group allegedly said it stood for.  Because Back in the 1980s, when Public Enemy came along, they said they were a pro-black rap group and they were all about standing up for black empowerment and getting black people to fight against the so-called white establishment.  However, your Flavor Flav in later years was out here flirting with Brigitte Nielsen and numerous white women on that minstrel show Flavor of Love.  And your Chuck D. gave all of that behavior that was diametrically opposed to everything that Public Enemy allegedly said it stood for a pass.  And your Chuck D. also gave your Flavor Flav a pass for his numerous arrests for drug use and his numerous arrests for domestic violence.  However, your Chuck D., only has a problem with Flavor Flav once he speaks against the Democratic Party.  And that's quite troubling when you consider it, because all of these behaviors that he participated in in the past that were detrimental to the image of black people and compromised the very mission of the group he has no problem with.  However, when your Flavor Flav decides to actually fight the power, then your Chuck D decides he has to take action.  And when he decided to fight the power, just like your Big Daddy Kane and your Rakim, your Chuck D wound up compromising everything that Public Enemy stood for.  So, when he decided to fight against your Flavor Flav, your Chuck D turned public enemy into its own worst enemy and now has shown us that yet another iconic 1980s rap group has betrayed everything it's believed in and is now just another part of the same establishment it says it was fighting against.  So, we can no longer... take your public enemy seriously anymore because your public enemy has sold out and betrayed all of the principles it says it's about.  Instead of being about real black empowerment, it is now another part of the so-called establishment and we now know what public enemy's price is.  Your Bernie Sanders came to them offered them a price, and now they have Bernie Sanders stamps on their necks.  They no longer have the iconic black figure in the Target.  No, they are now another part of the Bernie Sanders political machine.  Because if your Chuck D was really serious about fighting the power, he would be joining up with all of us other black people in the B-1 Brigade, and making sure that all of these politicians understand this simple concept.  No tangibles, no black vote.  No black agenda, no black vote.  But your Chuck D and public enemy can be bought for a few crumbs from the Bernie Sanders table, and because they're gonna sit there at the Bernie Sanders table, they're gonna get scraps from that slave master.  instead of demanding tangibles from this Democratic Party, because this is how you get something from the table, by having a platform that demands tangibles, not just jumping on any sort of bandwagon for a candidate who has not offered anything in terms of tangibles and has spoken directly against reparations.  Now, your Chuck D., He's supposed to be, again, pro-black and supposed to be so radical like he did in his iconic song, Fight the Power, but he's going to go along with a man who has clearly stated he is not interested in giving any sort of reparations to black people for the 400 years of slavery, nor is he interested in dealing with giving reparations for the over 50 years of discrimination, and not thinking about helping to deal with past and present discrimination.  So, when I look at your Chuck D, he has compromised himself and he doesn't know how badly he compromised himself because the scariest thing about selling out is you don't know you've done it.  And it's clear to me that your Chuck D doesn't know how he has sold out and sold out everything he has believed in.  He's looking at this situation with your Flavor Flav trying to tell him he's got a year to get it together, but he doesn't understand that he's already done once.  he decided to take a side with a political party that was the party of slavery, the party that fought in the Civil War to try to preserve slavery, the party that supported the Ku Klux Klan and terrorizing black people, the party that wanted to push Jim Crow and the state, the idea that blacks were second class citizens, the party that supported the establishment of the welfare state.  and the party that has Joe Biden as one of the candidates and created the 94 crime bill, which led to numerous black men being incarcerated and led to the destruction of numerous black families.  This is the party that your Chuck D is fighting with, a party that has worked to take black power away from black people, a party that fights against black people.  Again, showing us all how your Chuck D isn't fighting the power because your Chuck D is now a part of the establishment.  And your Chuck D, he's thinking, oh, this is a radical, this Bernie Sanders guy.  But no, he's not a radical.  He's just another tool in the Washington political machine.  And he found Chuck D's price, paid for it, and is trying to use your Chuck D as a shill to try to sell the idea that he's so radical.  But anybody with critical thinking skills can look past your Chuck D and see the scam being run on black people.  And self-aware black people now can see through your Chuck D and see through Bernie Sanders and see through both of them.  because if he's supposed to be, again, so pro-black, why is he not on a platform that doesn't choose any candidate?  Because the reason why we don't choose any candidate is because none of these candidates are offering us any tangibles.  Because If they're not offering tangibles, they don't get any endorsement.  If they're not offering tangibles, they don't get any vote.  Because as black people who have built this country over 400 years, we are the ones who deserve to get tangibles first.  And we deserve to get those tangibles because we have, again, we built this country.  We are the ones who keep the country functional.  And we are the ones who deserve to get those tangibles before all of these other groups who have gotten tangibles before us.  And again, when you see somebody like Public Enemy being put up there as this so-called rebel group talking about how they're fighting the power, it's clear to me that they're not fighting for our best interests because anybody who is really about fighting the power is about fighting for tangibles.  And they're not going to give any black votes to any political candidate unless they want to support giving us tangibles and a black vote.  So when I look at this whole situation with Public Enemy, it just shows how desperate your Bernie Sanders is, how sold out your Public Enemy is, and how people who said they were so against fighting the power are all about fighting for white supremacy.  because at the end of the day it looks like your public enemy had its price and just like the million dollar man said many years ago in his gimmick everybody's got a price for the million dollar man.  well it looks like your public enemy had a price and now we can look at them and say they are no longer about fighting for black power.  they're just all about fighting for white supremacy.  if you'd like to see me make more videos like this you can donate to my patreon my PayPal, or my Cash App by clicking the links in the description box.
