Going back to the beginning, I don't believe when this insidious virus hit our shores that we had enough time nor enough data to do anything but apply the heavy hand of one-size-fits-all force of government.  But since then, we've discovered that there are companies and organizations across the state, nation, and the world that are proving every day that they can learn to live and work with the virus, not be fearful of the virus.  So we went to the end of that first executive order, and she asked for a 70-day extension.  The legislature authorized a 23-day extension without conditions.  And we got to the end of the 23 days, And there was still a big gap in between our ability to have even understand how decisions are being made, let alone having a part of the decisions being made.  And at that point in time, we decided that enough is enough.  There's no more extension required, which does not mean that I don't think there should be a resulting state of emergency in Michigan.  It just needs to be more refined and narrowly focused. ",

There are a lot of people who are hurting, people who've been isolated for a couple of months now, people who have been mourning the loss of their job or worried about whether or not their small business will reopen.  And not to mention, a lot of people are mourning the loss of loved ones.  COVID-19 is still very present in Michigan.
