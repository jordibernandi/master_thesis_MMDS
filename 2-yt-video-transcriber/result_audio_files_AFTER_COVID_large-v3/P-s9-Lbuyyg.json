I mean, I have wonderful Christian friends who have very strong political opinions, but I don't know any who tie that together with the gospel.  They're voting in a way that they think is the most biblical and that they believe is... And we all do that.  We're all voting in the way that we believe is going to Because all laws legislate morality.  We want to legislate as best we can what we think God would have for people.

Okay.  So it needs to be legal.  Okay.  So you're, you want legislation that makes sure that abortion, and this would be on demand, abortion on demand for any reason is legal.

So if I said deliberately and intentionally killing the pre-born in the womb of their mother is a complicated issue.  Deliberately and intentionally killing the pre-born in the womb of their mother needs to be legal, safe and rare.  No, I think this needs to be illegal because it's never safe and doing it rarely is.  It doesn't help.  Like I only sometimes do this, do this kind of murderous behavior, but then it becomes okay.  What's, what's weird is that, um, this to them is a religious issue, right?  Like this is their, their, here's, here's me as a, I'm a, I'm a representative of Christianity.  I'm gonna deliver you from the bondage of conservative Christians.  And I want you to know abortion, you have to vote for abortion, right?  Like to me, this is a worse bondage because not only are you requiring my vote, but you're requiring it for an inexcusable behavior.  And, you know, they say it's a complicated issue, and I acknowledge that.  There are times where abortion is complicated, but probably the only time that people would say abortion is legitimate is when you have a mother and a baby and you're going to lose both because of the condition of the pregnancy.  And so you do a procedure, you kill one to save the other.  But I think we need to be very, very honest.  about the fact that we're actually taking a life to save a life.  It's like conjoined twins.  If one of them is going to die and it will kill the other, that's the only time you can separate them Resulting in the death of one because that death was going to happen.  Anyways, yeah, you're just so here.  we're pro-life.  We're just trying to save as many lives as possible. ",
