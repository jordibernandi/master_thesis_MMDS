The core takeaway is that when we ignore all other options but one, Pascal's wager is brilliant, and as such, it's a valid argument, and as we all know, Cameron loves those.  This step is so crucial and it's really, really unfortunate that it gets overlooked.  But once we consider competing options, which crucially threat eternal consequences, the wager is revealed for what it is \u2013 a con.  It's not a sound argument.  Now, to cross the T's and dot the I's, the pink unicorn, flying teapot, and the great juju at the bottom of the sea do not fret eternal consequences, and as such it's more reasonable to wager on gods and theologies that do fret eternal consequences, such as Osiris, Odin, Yahweh, Allah, and indeed the aforementioned atheist god.  Of course, we could now cover many more objections to Pascal's Wager, from the fact that we don't choose our beliefs, to an omniscient god knowing that you're being disingenuous, to the contradiction of an omnibenevolent god infinitely punishing someone for a finite crime.  But ironically, the last thing I'd like to say about Pascal's Wager is that despite it being deeply flawed, it is so much stronger than the majority of people realise, including Craig. ",

And yet, given the structure of the wager, it would still be rational to bet in his favour.  Why?  Because, in Pascal's words, the finite is annihilated in the presence of the infinite and becomes a pure nothing.  That is to say that the strength of the wager resides in the prospect of the eternal.  No finite bet, by definition, can outweigh the prospect of an infinite reward, so long as the chance of the reward is higher than zero.
