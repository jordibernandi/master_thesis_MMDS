            "text": "I was sworn into the United States Senate in a hospital.  My wife and daughter had been killed in an automobile crash.  And lying in the bed were my two little boys.  I couldn't have imagined what it would have been like if I didn't have insurance to cover them immediately and fully.  40 years later, one of those little boys, my son Bo, was diagnosed with terminal cancer, given months to live.  I can't fathom what would have happened if the insurance companies had the power to say, last few months you're on your own.  The fact of the matter is, healthcare is personal to me.  Obamacare is personal to me.  When I see the President of the United States try to eliminate this healthcare in the middle of a public health crisis, that's personal to me too.  We've got to build on what we did because every American deserves affordable healthcare.  I'm Joe Biden, and I approve this message. ",
