            "text": "Hello, everybody.  My name is Graham Elwood, and you are watching The Political Vigilante.  Well, Bill Gates is in the news a lot.  He's got some vaccines for people.  He wants to help everybody out.  But I'm one of the only people doing a story about his ties to Epstein.  That's right.  Bill Gates refuses to reveal why he flew on Lolita Express with Jeffrey Epstein four years after his release from prison while the billionaire was still chairman of Microsoft.  This came out over the summer when Epstein passed away.  I'm bringing it back now because everyone's, oh, Epstein's going to, he wants to vaccinate everybody and help and save.  He's tied to eugenics.  But this, that's why I can't trust the billionaire ruling class who comes on, they're going to save us all.  They're going to save themselves and try to profit on our demise.  And why can we trust anybody who Bill Gates and his spokespeople refused to explain why he flew from Teterboro Airport in New Jersey to Palm Beach on March 1st with Jeffrey Epstein.  Epstein told people in the past that he was a financial advisor to Gates, who was still chairman of Microsoft at the time.  A rep for Gates Humanitarian Foundation denied that Epstein ever worked for billionaire founder of Microsoft but would not comment on the 2013 flight.  Oh, we're gonna talk more about that.  rep for the foundation.  Gates spokesperson also stated that there were no financial or charitable ties between the two men.  Epstein had just been released from prison four years prior after pleading guilty to two counts of soliciting a minor under the age of 18 for sex.  Yeah.  So this flight, oh, flight logs, darn it FAA, why are you making, oh, look at that.  Bill Gates, Teterboro, Palm Beach, March 1st, 2013.  Why is the date so significant?  2013 is four years, four years after Jeffrey Gates pleaded guilty to having sex with a minor in Florida.  Now, Acosta, who Trump put in his cabinet, was told that Epstein had CIA ties, and that's why he gave him this soft deal.  That was the deal when Jeffrey Epstein was basically put in a resort.  He was allowed to leave every day with an ankle thing on, and he was flying around.  He was abusing and raping girls during that time.  But everybody knew that was public.  So four years after Epstein Four years.  Bill Gates was on his plane.  Of course, this is in addition to noted famous guests that Bill Clinton was on his plane, Naomi Campbell, yeah.  Yeah, good friends with Epstein, good friends with Jeline Maxwell, yeah.  What we're learning from doing this Epstein stuff is those big modeling agencies.  Victoria's Secret, Les Wexner has ties to Epstein.  Don't shop at Victoria's Secret anymore.  Don't.  They're awful.  I love their stuff.  I love it.  Dated plenty of women who shopped there, and I loved it, but don't give them your money.  Naomi Campbell used to... Oh, go recruit like Jelene Maxwell did.  And Epstein had a fake modeling agency.  The modeling industry is horrifying on its own.  The legal above board aspect of it is horrible.  So they'd go recruit children, children, 13, 14-year-old girls.  We're going to make you famous.  You're going to be a famous model.  Virginia Roberts got trafficked out of Mar-a-Lago.  Kevin Spacey, Parasite, Chris Tucker, and Prince Andrew.  We know all about Prince Andrew.  Virginia Roberts named him.  He gave that ridiculous interview.  Oh, I lost my sweat glands in the war, and I'd never be caught outside in London without a sport coat.  He's... 26 times.  Bill Clinton was on Epstein's plane.  Hillary was on twice.  Hillary and Bill were in Epstein's compound in New Mexico numerous times.  So that's the kind of crowd you're flying around with, Bill.  And it is known that the two had spent time together previously, most notably at the Edge dinner.  What's the EDGE dinner?  Each year welcomes billionaires from around the world to come together and discuss advancements they are working on in the worlds of math, science, and technology.  That sounds innocent enough.  That's, by the way, where Epstein tried to do his eugenics thing.  Epstein wanted, I did a video on this.  I have a whole Epstein playlist.  Watch, go into it.  And coincidentally, the Epstein playlist and the demonetized playlist, a lot of overlap.  But on my Epstein playlist, I talk about, there's a video I did where Epstein wanted to literally impregnate women for a master race.  Totally true.  Bill Gates, vaccines, eugenics, he's tied into that world.  Interesting.  Interesting.  But listen to this, the 2013 edge, the billionaire, let's get together and figure out how to destroy the world so we can have more private jets.  It took place two nights before they flew to Florida.  So they do this edge dinner, two nights later, the flight log I just showed you, they fly to Florida on the Lolita Express.  Oh, weird.  Gee, I wonder what they talked about at this Edge dinner.  Bill Gates has said in an email, boy, Epstein's, in 2011, Epstein's got some interesting social habits, or whatever that email said, in 2011.  So he already knew in 2011 who Epstein was.  Was at that dinner, he knew what was going on in that plane.  He knew what was going on.  I mean, literally.  One of the things in the Epstein playlist is watch my interview with child crimes investigator, former Phoenix detective, Eric Oldenburg.  Well, I proposed this stuff, and I said, as an investigator, if you saw this, what would you think?  Oh, this points to somebody being guilty.  I said, what if somebody said they were only on his plane four times, but flight logs showed 26 times?  He starts laughing.  He goes, that would show them to be guilty.  The biography that was published on the website for Edge, but later deleted... So that billionaire dinner where they're all hanging out two nights before he gets on Epstein plane, they put this biography on the website and then they delete it.  Why do you need to delete something?  That's weird.  It's noted that Epstein founded the Jeffrey Epstein Foundation in 2000 to fund and support cutting-edge science around the world.  That's the eugenics thing I was talking about.  He literally wanted to create a master race.  Jeffrey Epstein, evil beyond comprehension.  That's like what the Nazis wanted to do.  So this is the biography.  So when they, on their edge thing, they said, these are the billionaires that are gonna be there.  And this was Epstein's biography that they later took down like they didn't know who he was.  The biography then states that Epstein has an active role in supporting education across the United States as well as philanthropy in the United States Virgin Islands where the foundation is based.  So many of these foundations, and we know this was Epstein, Their foundations are fake, like the Clinton Foundation is used just to sell weapons and export kids from Haiti and all that stuff.  This is, this was, Epstein's foundations are the Virgin Islands.  That horrific island, again, that I show drone footage from in my Epstein playlist, go back and watch it.  I show drone footage of that island.  It is the creepiest thing you've ever seen.  There's this weird, looks like some kind of ritual, There's no things you would think you would normally see on a rich person's island.  Oh, you'd see tennis courts and a swimming pool and, oh, beach volleyball.  Toys for rich people to have.  No, you see creepy, weird things.  That's where the foundation was.  Oh, it's the foundation out of the Virgin Islands.  Try to tell me Bill Gates didn't know.  People at the Edge Foundation didn't know about this? ",
