            "text": "I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  What up, y'all?  There's a call over here that some lady was destroying a neighbor's Christmas decorations.  I believe there's been a couple of 5150s on her before.  Just last time they were here, she was allegedly armed with a kitchen knife.  Are you guys the same ones from yesterday or just a while ago?  14 right now.  She just a while ago, she did the same thing.  I called the 911.  You guys came in right now.  She just destroyed my Christmas time.  The stranger is, I think, giving her drugs.  You know, she's, you know, Got me all nervous.  Is there anything else you need from me guys?  I'm in apartment number three guys.  Let me put a mask on, let me put a mask on.  We got part one seen already.  Yeah.  Okay.  So, at first, Nana's like, Nana's like, she ripped this all down.  And it's just hard to stop right now.  We need to stop.  All I have is, I was like, Mama, you can go all out for Christmas for me.  Why are you guys out here with cameras?  Filming the cops.  You can't trust cops nowadays, right?  Maybe taken, not killed, right?  Yeah, there's a big difference.  That's why I'm here.  But I doubt the killer.  There are good cops around here, too.  Is that right?  Not all of them are bad.  Is that right?  Can we talk through the window at least?  I film cops every day for the past eight years.  Oh, wow.  I think I know a little bit about cops.  Well, not all cops are bad.  The majority of them are.  Then you wouldn't mind us filming them.  Right.  Then you wouldn't mind us filming them.  Yeah.  No, I just thought it was strange because he has mental health issues.  Right.  You don't want to like... Can you hear me?  I mean, it's kind of personal.  People have mental health issues.  I mean, Right.  That's why social workers should be dealing with her instead of cops, right?  Well, that's what the right.  Yeah.  We're just here making sure that everything's okay.  Nothing wrong with that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I guess it's a good thing that she's on camera.  But at the same time, I get completely confused because I'm like, he has a bunch of pelts on him.  First of all, she's still in her apartment.  I can't even see her.  And just because she has mental health issues don't mean that I don't have a right to film.  First Amendment.  I feel you.  I mean it is a good thing.  I mean it's better to make sure that the cops aren't doing anything bad to you.  And that's all we're doing.  We're not here to end.  I do completely agree with that.  Right on.  So one more time, I guess this lady in this apartment allegedly destroyed a neighbor's Christmas lights.  I guess it happened before.  Okay, they just said that code four that she was destroying her own property.  Technically no crime has been committed, so they're gonna walk away.  Now they're asking her to step out of her apartment.  I'll see you guys in court.  She might be mentally ill, but at least she knows her rights.  I'm hoping you might not have ran But I will do that.  I will do that. ",
