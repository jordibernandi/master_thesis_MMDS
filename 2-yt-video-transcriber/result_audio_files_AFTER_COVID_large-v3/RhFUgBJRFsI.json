I feel like this will be the death knell for many restaurants and potentially other businesses as well.  I'm not happy about it.  I'm really angry that we're lumped in in the Southern California district.  Our ICU rates, when I last checked, maybe yesterday, were 21.5% or 22%.  The Palma Valley, I don't know where it was.  It was like 6%.  So we're being pulled down by that low average.  And we're suffering now.  And we've done... here restaurants in little italy.  i think almost every restaurant town has done the right thing.  we've been responsible we've cared about our employees and really about our customers and our guests.  i mean after all it's the hospitality business.  without them we have nothing.  so why not make sure that we're taking care of them the right way?  and we've really done that.  and now we're being punished.
