            "text": "Praise be Jesus Christ.  In the history of humanity we find a man who claimed he came from heaven.  That he was sent by God the Father to teach us the truth and to lead us, to show us the way to heaven.  This man changed the world forever and he taught us to love.  He taught us to love the God who made us, and he taught us to love one another.  This man is the Lord Jesus Christ.  Throughout the centuries since his coming into the world, many nations have tried to follow the teaching of the Lord Jesus Christ, even while respecting each individual to search truth freely, many nations have acknowledged that Jesus Christ is the Lord.  He's Savior.  Now, today, in some of the Western world, there are regimes that are hostile to the teachings of our Lord Jesus Christ.  And there's also, throughout the world, a renewed desire to have a one world government, a new world order that will fix all of our problems.  Now, when I was a teenager before my conversion, I thought a one world government could fix all of our problems because I was touched by a song by White Lion called When the Children Cry.  The lyrics begin, little child, dry your crying eyes.  How can I explain the fear you feel inside?  Because you were born into this evil world where man is killing man and no one knows just why.  What have we become?  Just look at what we have done.  All that we destroyed, you must build again.  And then it goes on to give the solution.  That we all can live with love and peace.  No more presidents.  And all the wars will end.  One united world under God.  And I thought to myself, yeah, why doesn't the world just unite?  There's so much wealth.  There's so much resources in the world.  Why don't we just unite and first of all, help all the people who are starving.  There shouldn't be starving people in this world.  Then we can deal with diseases, kind of like today.  we got this COVID-19, let the nations work together to come up with a vaccine.  Then we can clean up the environment, get all the trash out of the oceans and clean up our rivers.  Why can't we do that?  Isn't that a beautiful aspiration?  Isn't that a good desire?  The answer is yes, it's a beautiful aspiration and it's a good desire.  The only problem is if you try to do it Without God, or by rejecting God's commandments, you're building on sand.  Our Lord Jesus says, everyone who listens to these words of mine but does not act on them will be like a fool who built his house on sand.  The rain fell, the floods came, and the winds blew and buffeted the house, and it collapsed and was completely ruined.  An example of this is the communist regimes, the atheistic communist regimes.  They promised us paradise on earth.  They promised us a utopia.  But they said, we got to get rid of this notion of religion.  All these doctrines.  We need to, as the people, fix the world's problems.  There's new philosophies.  There's new ideologies.  We have science now.  Do away with religion.  Let's fix the world.  And so many people said, yeah, of course, power to the people.  Let's fix everything.  Let's create our paradise.  And the problem is, is that these regimes, their philosophy was they didn't believe in the dignity of the human person, that we are a temple of the Holy Spirit with an immortal soul.  They didn't believe that because they didn't believe in God.  So the philosophy was, listen, we're going to create a perfect world.  And if you get in the way of our perfect world, you are an enemy of the state.  And so we'll kill you.  Article from the Washington Post, collectively communism states killed as many as 100 million people.  More than all other repressive regimes combined during the same time period.  By far the biggest toll arose from communist efforts to collectivize agriculture and eliminate independent property.  Yeah, utopia, we're gonna fix this.  Check this out.  eliminate independent property-owning peasants.  In China alone, Mao Zedong's Great Leap Forward led to a man-made famine in which as many as 45 million people perished.  45 million people perished, and the leaders, the communist, atheistic leaders, they didn't care because they didn't recognize the dignity of the human person.  They thought they were God, they could fix all the world's problems, and look at the pain and suffering they caused.  This whole notion that we can create a one world government, a new world order that's going to fix all the world's problems, but not respect God's divine law is foolishness.  It's building on sand.  It's not going to work.  Because as I said, God so loved the world that he sent his only begotten son so that whoever believes in him will not perish, but will have eternal life.  I follow the Lord Jesus.  He alone shows us the way to heaven.  Viva Cristo. ",
