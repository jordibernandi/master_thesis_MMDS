            "text": "I'm not going to make this too long, but I'll give you a brief story and then I have to tell you what happened.  I have actually been up since 2.30 this morning, unable to go back to sleep.  And I was burdened, when I say I was burdened, I was restless in my spirit is a better word because I've been under burdens and I know the difference between a heavy weight and a restlessness.  and so I got up and ate a little bit of breakfast and went on the internet and posted some things on Facebook.  You've probably already seen those.  So I came over to my lodge and I have a room in the lodge that I can actually just rest in and pray and I go in there probably every day.  So I went in there for a little over an hour.  It may have actually been an hour and a half and began to meditate on the Lord.  And right in, I just, I came out of, came out of like a deep state of prayer, meditating on God.  And I heard these words and I want to give you an explanation because I had to look this phrase up to see what it meant.  And I heard, and when I say I heard, I hear this.  I'm not thinking it.  I'm not thinking in my mind.  My mind is completely blank.  The day of reckoning has come.  The day of reckoning has come.  So I looked up, I came back into this part of the office and the word reckoning, the day of reckoning, the phrase means a time when the consequences of a course of mistakes or misdeeds are felt.  A time when the consequences of a course of misdeeds are felt.  Then I went to a Bible program and began to look at some of the verses on reckoning.  I want you to listen to a few of these verses.  I'm not going to give you all of them.  I don't want this to be the eternal Facebook report, but we need to hear this, I believe.  Genesis 9-5, And surely for your lifeblood I will require an accounting from every beast.  I will require it.  and from man and from every man who spills another's lifeblood ought to require a reckoning.  Now I'm bringing that verse out related to the abortion issue.  We've aborted, what is it, 60 to 70 million children, infants, actually living beings, true living beings, not fetuses, living beings.  And it's the sin of shedding innocent blood.  and it's mentioned throughout the scriptures.  and really, Judgments can come, severe judgments, to cities like Jerusalem in Matthew 23 for the shedding of innocent blood.  I want to go to, there's a whole list of about 50 scriptures, but I want to go try to find these two.  Hosea 9-7, because if the Lord gives you a word, he'll back it up by scripture.  The day of reckoning has come.  The days of visitation have come.  The days of reckoning have come.  Israel will consider the prophet to be a fool and the man who is inspired to be insane because of the abundance of your sins and because your hostility is great.  So God is saying to Israel, I'm going to reckon a judgment on you because when I sent prophets, you said they're stupid.  And when I sent men who were inspired to speak, you said they were insane.  I'm getting... Just on my Facebook page, people that are posting and posting video clips of me and posting things and just calling me an idiot and a fool, a religious fanatic.  So there you go.  That's the same thing that happened, of course, in ancient Israel.  And that was before the Babylonian captivity.  There's another one here that was very significant.  Give me just a second here, Isaiah.  You know what, let me give this to you, Isaiah 2.12.  Isaiah 2.12, there we go.  For the Lord of hosts will have a day of reckoning against everyone who is proud and lofty and against everyone who is lifted up that he may be brought down or abased.  The lofty and the proud will be abased in the day of reckoning.  Romans 9.28, this one really stuck with me.  For the Lord will hold a reckoning upon the earth.  making it a facious and brief.  So in other words, if I look at Romans 9, 28, and let's say President Trump said that this coronavirus should come to a peak, let's say in August, well, that's not a long time, it's a brief time.  It is a long time for if you're confined or limited or whatever in your activities, but God will make a reckoning on the earth for a brief period of time, Romans 9, verse 28.  Now I'm gonna say this, and I do believe that the majority of people who keep up with us on Facebook, and I do not put some things on Facebook.  You need to go to my YouTube channel and look at the other day, because we have pictures there about the cities being emptied, the vision from 15 years ago.  And I found another picture drawing last night.  I have it on my phone.  and I thought I had it on my phone, I'm not sure, I don't wanna take all the time to look this up, but I took a picture of it last night, and it's from a vision that I had of the 9-11 attack, and the people, I don't know if Nathan can get that, this was drawn years ago in 1999, The businesses were empty.  You don't see that in the picture.  The businesses are empty.  This business was completely shut down.  I'm getting, well, let me just hold, cover that.  People were outside, not in buildings, and they were looking for clothes.  bottled water and food.  And I was standing in this, this was a vision, one of the seven visions I've had.  I was standing in front of a church and these were the pearls of my ministry.  And there were five of them and they had been busted by this great storm.  And I was putting them back together.  And I always told Pam that I felt like that.  each pearl represented a month of ministry.  that's five months.  the reason I'm saying that is my schedule already for two months.  maybe three months has pretty much been canceled.  we're going to.  we're holding on to the prophetic summit at this point thinking that we may do something very different with it but we're not sure if we're going to do that or be able to do that we may have to move the prophetic summit to a later date in the fall.  we don't know we don't know yet we're looking into some things.  But I'm going to tell you and be very blunt as a man who understands Bible prophecy and understands the Bible.  The Bible has been my life.  You know that we did a commentary on the old New Testaments.  You put them together, the two Bibles are that thick.  Many of you have seen those where we've talked about that.  And so I know the scripture and I was raised in the scripture.  I'm a fourth generation minister.  I'm only saying that to make a point.  that I know what scripture says.  And so if we come to you and say, this is what the word of God says.  I had a guy on Facebook this morning say, the mark of the beast is spiritual, not literal.  I said, no, it's literal because later on, if you know the Bible, you know that a sore breaks out and infects people who have the mark.  So that's not spiritual or mental in the mind, that's literal.  So you have to know all the Bible.  You have to put it all together, not just a piece here or there.  There's two national sins.  There's more than this, but there's two national sins.  Number one is the law of, it's an abomination that a man can marry a man and a woman can marry a woman, whether people believe it or not, like it or not, it's an abomination.  And it's a law that sent Sodom and Gomorrah into its burning destruction.  And that's in the New Testament, by the way, it mentions that.  The shedding of innocent blood is horrible and we have aborted infants and made it legal.  So we've legalized the second abomination.  So the United States has had two things that God in the Bible calls abominations and we bragged on it.  We've taken an emblem.  That is the rainbow that God made a covenant with Noah, and there's a whole group of people that now go under the rainbow, so they have mocked the covenant.  And God says in the book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy, you have made a controversy with my covenant, and that's what we've done.  So you listen to me.  This is, I know when I hear from the Lord, and I don't care, I'm at the point.  I don't care if people believe me or not.  I'm not here to be, one guy told me, if you'll calm down on all your preaching and all this stuff, you could be popular.  I told him, God didn't call me to be popular.  God called me to be obedient.  I fear God and not, I don't fear anybody watching me.  I fear God because I have to answer to him if I hear something.  If I say, I'm not saying that, I'm not going to go speak that.  And he told me years ago, he said, I'll give you a worldwide ministry.  And one of the three things he told me, he says, you will have to preach to people what I give you.  And I've never forgot that.  That was probably the first vision I ever had in my life was February 1988 when I saw that man standing beside that big tower.  That's another story.  But let me say this to you.  This is the word.  And I know there's other ministers and people that are receiving words from the Lord to help you, to help you through this.  This is the day of reckoning.  Now Romans 9, 28, it will be... Very, very efficacious.  And I haven't even looked this word up.  And brief.  That's what we need to, we need to hold on to God.  Say, God, yes, we're today reckoning, but we pray to be brief.  But here's what believers have to do.  If my people call by my name, the world's not going to repent.  You know, young people are out in groups drinking and partying and just partying, making, having a party right now.  And because they said, here's a quote from one of the young people, we're invincible.  This virus does not affect us.  How crazy is that?  But they're doing it.  So it's up to the people of God to repent for these two national sins.  50% of America has lost it.  Half of the American population is becoming anti-God, anti-Christian, and if they believe in God, I don't even know what God they're believing in.  And so we're at 50-50 right now, but that 50% could save the nation right now because if God could have found 10 in Sodom and Gomorrah, he'd spared the city.  And I'm not, you know, I'm not slipping out.  Like I said, I've been up since 2.30.  I'm very weary.  But I'm going to probably go ahead at OCI tonight, and you can watch it on the internet and preach a message using this and doing some more explanations.  So I'll leave my other explanation up for probably tonight's service.  And again, it'll be online.  I want you to.  As you can see, it's blowing up with text right now.  So I'm going to have to go look at these.  But I want to thank you for joining me.  And here's what I'd like for you to do.  If you know believers, don't send this to a bunch of pagans because all they're going to do is mock.  And the Bible said this, cast not your prayer before swine.  And that's what Jesus referred to.  There's no sense in trying to convince somebody who's a total unbelieving pagan who doesn't believe what you're saying.  So just leave them alone.  If you have a church group or Christian group or Christian friends, I want you to send this to them because I really feel like I need to hear this, that it's time for the people of God to turn and repent for the nation and believe God to help us in this season and give us grace.  We know that's going to come out for them and the gospel is going to be preached around the world.  So definitely it's being done now on the internet like never before. ",
