            "text": "We stand for inclusion.  This is the same Star Wars.  The same Star Wars.  The same Disney that had this poster in America.  Right?  You see there?  You got all the characters there from Star Wars.  But then, when they made a Chinese version and they brought it over to China, they edited the poster.  Can you spot the difference?  Huh.  Where?  Oh, where is the black guy?  Wow, so you're talking about inclusion.  You are virtue signaling to the world about inclusion during this time, but you, you edited out the black guy.  Like how hypocritical, how stupid.  Oh my... Honestly though, is anyone really surprised at these virtue signaling celebrities?  These idiots, they're everywhere.  They're everywhere.  But are we surprised at this point?  This cringy, out of control, virtue signaling, SJW insanity.  It's everywhere.  It is absolutely everywhere.  That's why today we're going to do a special version of the game.  Instead of you laugh, you lose, or you cringe, you lose.  It's you cringe... You win.  Yes.  If you cringe at any of this stuff today, you win.  It means you have an ounce of sanity left in your brain.  And that's a good thing.  That's a good thing.  It means you're not a virtue signaling plot.  And I think this is just a good way to put in perspective some of the people that are involved in these protests and people that are.  telling you how bad the world is it?  just it the people that are doing this stuff.  they're insane they're nuts.  but before we get to today's game of you cringe you win.  i first want to tell you guys that i'm proud to say that my team and i have made zusa the official brand of this channel.  so head over to the link in the description.  there are also many other designs and obviously if you head over there and you buy something you do help this channel and future videos.  so thanks to those who already have i hope you go over there and check them out and let me know what you think.  now on to today's you cringe you win.  If you are on Instagram, or I mean even on Twitter or Facebook, you probably heard about this because it was all over the place.  On Instagram the other day, everyone decided that they were going to post a black square to show their solidarity with the protesters for equality, for justice, for being against police brutality.  And the celebrities, all of the celebrities started this.  And it was everywhere.  And they were wanting to spread awareness everywhere.  And you know what?  A lot of you might disagree with me here, but I think spreading awareness is just an excuse to do what you're doing.  so you feel good.  You know, and you might raise a few bucks here and there, but are you really doing much more than making yourself feel good by thinking you're a part of the cause?  You're not really a part of the cause.  I just want to let you know.  And one of the leaders of Black Lives Matter actually called all of these people out and said they are being very counterproductive. ",

We know that it's no intent to harm, but to be frank, this essentially does harm the message.  We use hashtag to keep people updated.  Please stop using the hashtag for black images.  There you go.

            "text": "You ruined it.  You ruined the communication system.  How do you feel?  How do you feel that you were actually counterproductive by virtue signaling like this?  good job that is just the tip of the iceberg of cringe.  in this past week all over the internet you can see photos like this stop racism bro.  yeah like dude man.  stop racism.  this you know.  this is for the gram looking off into the distance.  oh dude yeah uh-huh.  And then you got this girl.  She literally solved racism.  She solved it with this artistic motif.  Look at this.  This is just so powerful.  So powerful.  She solved it, guys.  We now have the solution to it all.  We do.  We do.  We have the solution.  Same goes for this girl.  Showing her solidarity.  Nice work.  Way to go.  And as you saw on Sunday's episode, this guy wearing blackface... i can't breathe.  he says i hope you showed up if you see this.  if anyone knows who this is Please let us know.  Did you show up to the rally?  And how were you welcomed?  I'm going to go ahead and assume not very well.  And then you have this lady also wearing blackface.  This influencer is a Filipino influencer and is wearing blackface.  You know, just showing solidarity, showing support all for the post, doing it for the gram.  And speaking of Instagram, you had a lot of people taking advantage of the situation for the photo op.  There's this girl here.  Oh, yeah, take a picture.  Look at me.  I'm helping... Block the windows.  I'm helping up.  Board up the windows.  Oh, but are you?  Nope, she's not.  She's doing it for the gram.  Doing it.  She got into the Mercedes.  Oh, my God, dude.  She got into the Mercedes after faking.  I can't waste a photo op, guys.  You can't waste a photo op.  Take it from this girl, too.  Look at that.  Oh, marching.  That actually looks like a peaceful protest.  I'll say that.  But she's not even a part of it.  She's just down there to get a pic.  Take, oh yeah, make sure that one foot's in front of the other.  Smile, oh, yeah, they keep walking in front of you.  All right, you got it?  You got it, honey, you got my picture?  Dude, unreal.  Nice work.  Way to be out there.  Way to be out there in support of your own Instagram page.  Good job.  And this one, what are you, like, oh, yeah.  I'm going to take a picture of this one because I'm just, she's like standing there.  The picture says, I just can't believe it.  I just can't believe the damage.  My heart hurts.  Oh, yeah.  Look at me in my yoga pants.  Dumb.  The Instagram opportunity.  Idiots, idiots, idiots.  And this one is even worse.  Look at that.  Hey, boys.  Yeah, look what we did.  We burned a car.  Look at that.  We burned a car.  You got the pic?  All right, let's go.  Let's move on.  Then you got this.  This is like peak cringe right here.  His name was George Floyd.  He could not breathe.  And you're, why?  Why, like, why does everything, why does every post on Instagram have to be like this?  Half of them, it's like, you got it?  Oh yeah, George Floyd, justice, justice, police brutality, justice, George Floyd.  You got my ass in there?  Yep, uh-huh.  What is a picture of your ass doing for George Floyd and his family?  You're not, you don't care about George Floyd.  You care about your post.  Otherwise your ass wouldn't be in it.  Period.  Come on.  White neighbors kneel down and beg their black neighbors for forgiveness on behalf of whites for years of racism.  Such a beautiful moment.  And there it is.  I just don't understand how that does anything.  And not even to mention how can you be sorry for something you didn't do?  How narcissistic and how arrogant to think that you can atone for somebody else's sins.  You can't.  You can't.  Here's what you can do.  You can treat people how you want to be treated.  It's like we learn it in kindergarten.  We learn it in Sunday school.  It's so incredibly sad that people don't get taught that.  That is the solution away from preaching here.  How does this do anything?  And mind you, are we supposed to apologize for other bad things that we in the present day did not do?  I just don't get it.  I don't understand how this helps anyone.  I mean, even the people getting apologized to, like, what does this do for them?  It just shows that you as an individual are an arrogant, narcissistic, virtue signaling person.  That's it.  That's all it says.  You can't apologize for other people.  You just can't.  I'm sorry.  About racism, anti-blackness, or violence.  About racism, anti-blackness, or violence.  I will use my voice in the most uplifting way possible.  And do everything in my power to educate my community.  I will love my black neighbors the same as my white ones.  Again.  I'm not sure what that does.  But just try to show how woke you are.  That's it.  I just, I don't get it.  I don't get it.  My child just said, fascists.  And he's two.  So some failures and some victories over here.  189,000 likes.  Hmm.  This, everyone, is why parenting, parenting, parenting, parenting is so important.  Benefit of the doubt, the two-year-old could have learned that themselves.  I don't know.  Maybe if there's some prodigy, some genius, they're good at reading at two years old, maybe they found this in a handbook somewhere.  I don't know.  And these final two clips.  Don't destroy things, guys.  Don't destroy things.  But we have some more proof that some things are just built better than others.  Or maybe it's the opposite.  I don't know.  There you go.  Breaking it.  Oh!  Oh, no, dude.  No, no, no.  Break it.  Oh!  Oh, no.  Come on, man.  First off, why are you doing that?  Second off, that's what happens.  and then you got this girl.  look at her oh i don't even.  what is that?  a machete she has.  it looks like a machete a very very large machete and she's about to go loot and write with it.  oh no dude.  No, that's like, dude.  Come on.  Come on.  Oh, dude.  Come on.  Idiots.  As I've said, a lot of these people out there, they're not out there for the right reasons.  I do believe that, yes, there are a lot of peaceful protesters out there.  Yes, and they can protest whatever they want because that's the beauty of this country.  But again, I don't think it does much.  And for both sides, I really don't.  I think you garner more resentment than you do support.  Let me know what you guys think in the comments.
