            "text": "You already know where I shake out politically.  This isn't really about that.  This is an examination of a phenomenon that's taking place all across the country right now.  We have seen over the past several years with Donald Trump the lining up of evangelicals, the zealot activists, the fundamental Christians.  The scam evangelists, as my friend Hemet Mehta likes to say.  And they've anointed Donald Trump their savior figure, and they've rallied behind him.  And in advance of this election, they have named and claimed Donald Trump's second term as kind of a divine foregone conclusion, right?  This is God's guy.  He's going to win.  We name it.  We claim it.  Amen.  Hallelujah.  And all of a sudden, the election happens.  And Donald Trump's opponent has 5 million more popular votes than Donald Trump and has 290 electoral votes.  Now, it's not official yet, but this is where it shakes out so far.  It appears obvious he will be at 290, which is an easy victory in the electoral college.  He will be the next president of the United States.  And these evangelicals are losing their minds.  The media said Joe Biden's president.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  That's a tough clip to watch in its entirety.  If you made it through, I commend you.  I found it difficult to watch because it's just so bizarre.  Of course, that is Kenneth Copeland.  He has a long history of posting bizarre stuff, preaching bizarre sermons, making bizarre statements.  I think he counts among the scam evangelist, right?  He's in that category.  This is Paula White.  We've talked a lot about her.  She, of course, has a hall pass to the White House, which is weird in a state church separated government.  Another millionaire scam evangelist who is on Donald Trump's evangelical advisory board and is, get this, Donald Trump's personal spiritual advisor.  She has direct access to the president.  The election is not going her way.  So she held a sermon where she called down or called over angels from Africa. ",

Is he somehow amplifying the message or is the Bible serving as a conduit?  You know, the open pages are a conduit for God's power or perhaps the power of the angels from Africa.  I have questions about this, of course, because it's the Internet.  Took about 10 seconds before people started to post Paula White remixes. ",

Jesus, in his best form, is talking about charity and love and don't be vengeful and love your enemies and care for people and just don't be an awful person, right?  But for them, the abortion question becomes overarching.  It is all-encompassing.  And those who vote for a woman's right to choose, they have indeed made a covenant with.

Every Christian, every pastor out there that voted for Joe Biden last night, you have brought a curse upon yourself and your family, your children, and your children's children, down to the third and fourth generation, and you need to repent.

            "text": "I would encourage members of Bethel Church and all of his viewers and listeners around the world to perhaps take a step backward and ask yourself how someone who is divinely appointed, receiving God's perfect instruction, can make such a major, M-A-J-O-R, major mistake.  Now, here's the point I'm trying to make.  The people who are losing their minds about the way the election is going because their man, their chosen one, is obviously not going to win a second term.  They are betraying that their God was not able to pull off the big win.  God is without limit.  God is omniscient, omnipotent, all-powerful.  There's nothing he does not know and cannot do.  God is God.  And yet God was not able to pull off a Trump victory for his second term.  This immediately calls into question the omnipotence of God.  Because if he willed it, if he wanted it, if he had destined it, it would have come to pass.  So if it doesn't come to pass... Can God really do anything and everything?  And here's the more important and I think more interesting scenario.  If their claim with Donald Trump is that God sometimes uses flawed people, even awful people, to carry out his will, kind of a King Cyrus argument, And Biden wins the election by 5 million popular votes and 290 electoral votes are in the can.  So it's decisive, okay?  At that point does the narrative switch to embrace the notion that God is using.  Joe Biden, God's destiny, was this other candidate for this other time, such a time as this.  And God is going to use that flawed person to carry out his divine destiny.  If God's will is to be done, God's will will always be done.  It is God's perfect master plan.  If this is part of the plan, I would think the evangelicals would be lining up lockstep despite any disagreements they might have with his philosophy or person, or policies.  As they did with Donald Trump, they took all the bad and they brushed it off the table and decided to ignore it.  If God has appointed Joe Biden, they have to take all the stuff they don't like, brush it off the table, and ignore it.  Because this is God's perfect plan.  Now, regardless of what happens next, these evangelicals have egg all over their faces.  They named and claimed and prophesied and demanded and called down the power of the Almighty, and things did not go their way.  In the case of many of them, They sort of got in bed with someone who is the antithesis of what they would preach about in Sunday sermon.  Godly values, morality, honesty, honor, loyalty, truth, fidelity, etc.  Now they're in bed with someone who is the antithesis of all those teachings, and they have to find a way to extricate or excuse or figure out how to move forward.  Some people, I think, are going to continue to pound the drum of doom and gloom and prophecy and curses and the dark days ahead because we have strayed from their particular God.  And I think other people are going to try to adapt to survive and they're going to rationalize their way through or navigate their way through just to retain power.  It'll be interesting to see which of these people remain loyal and allegiant to this weird apocalypse narrative and which ones become the rats that are scrambling to try to escape the sinking ship.  Regardless, I think this is a useful case study in delusion and corruption.  And as these people continue their slide into oblivion, they will remain very interesting to watch.  Thank you. ",
