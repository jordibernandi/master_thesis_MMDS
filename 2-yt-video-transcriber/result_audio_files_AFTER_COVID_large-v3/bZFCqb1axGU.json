            "text": "A legal threat has forced conservative networks Fox News and Newsmax to commit an act of journalism.  Now, this story is hilarious.  I'm going to get to some of the videos in a minute here, showing you how they were forced to react to this legal threat.  But basically, this is over claims of voter fraud, which, of course, there was no widespread voter fraud.  In fact, there's a story coming out.  I covered this a few weeks ago, but there's a story where... A Republican tried to vote for his dead mother, and now there's a news story out saying that he's actually been charged with this.  But anyways, there's no widespread voter fraud, of course, but this is over those claims regarding one specific company, Smartmatic.  So before I get to how Fox News was forced to correct this, let me first play for you a clip from Lou Dobbs on Fox News.  This is, I believe, from a few weeks ago.  Lou Dobbs discussing various companies, including this company, Smartmatic. ",

Now, we've asked both Dominion and Smartmatic about their role on the CISA November 12th statement disputing election fraud or intervention by foreign governments.  Smartmatic said they didn't have any input.  Dominion They didn't get back to us for some reason.  Dominion voting systems did send us an email titled setting the record straight. ",

            "end_time": "00:01:44,360",
            "text": "All right.  Now, before I go any further, I just I'm laughing because the end of that clip, Lou Dobbs says Dominion, they didn't get back to us.  And then he goes to an email that they were sent from Dominion.  It's amazing to me that anybody can watch this shit.  Anyways, so similar segments were done about this on Maria Bartiromo's show, on Jeanine Pirro's show, on Newsmax, a different conservative network, discussing how Smartmatic, you know, they were involved in this widespread voter fraud, working with the Democratic Party to steal the election for Joe Biden.  Well, just one problem.  Smartmatic wasn't even used in the contested states.  The company, now a major global player with over 300 employees, pulled out of the United States in 2007 after controversy over its founder's Venezuelan roots, and its only involvement this November was with a contract to help Los Angeles County run its election.  Smartmatic wasn't even involved.  So, of course, what happens?  These networks, Fox News, Newsmax, get sent a cease and desist letter over these false claims of Smartmatic's involvement in the election.  So this is a, I believe, a 20-page letter, but they say here in part, just I'll read one paragraph.  Fox News has engaged in a concerted disinformation campaign against Smartmatic.  Fox News told its millions of viewers and readers that Smartmatic was founded by Hugo Chavez, that its software was designed to fix elections.  and that Smartmatic conspired with others to defraud the American people and fix the 2020 U.S.  election by changing, inflating, and deleting votes.  While Fox News holds itself out as a trusted news source, it has continually and repeatedly pushed demonstrably false information and defamatory statements about Smartmatic.  So, you see here, clear legal threat.  Again, it goes deeper into the specifics about what exactly was said and why it's not true.  So... Of course, this actually forced Fox News to commit some journalism.  So I'm going to play for you, I believe it's three clips here.  Lou Dobbs, Maria Bartiromo, and Newsmax all having to correct this information with Fox News essentially playing the exact same clip twice.  Watch this. ",
