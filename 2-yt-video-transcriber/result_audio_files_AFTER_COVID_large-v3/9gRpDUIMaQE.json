So here's how it works, and it really is a very simple game.  Our contestants are going to take it in turn to say something silly.  And after they've said it, you've got to predict whether the next contestant is going to say something more stupid or less stupid.  And my answers are going to be in the description of this video so you can see how you got on.  Anyway, let's start here. ",
