            "text": "Hi everyone.  So a while back, Paula Gia responded to a video by Capturing Christianity in which Capturing Christianity presents a new take on the fine-tuning argument.  At least it was new for me.  Paul handled it pretty well.  I'm linking to his video in the description.  But I want to bring up a problem that he missed.  Here's the argument.  1.  The probability that our universe would be life-permitting given naturalism is very, very low.  2.  The probability that our universe would be life-permitting given theism is not very, very low.  3.  The fact that our universe is life-permitting provides evidence of theism over naturalism.  Okay, that sounds pretty intuitive.  I'll give you that.  But here's the problem.  Say we've drawn a marble from one of two barrels.  We don't know which.  The marble we drew was red.  Originally, the small barrel had nine red and one blue marble.  The big barrel had 900 blue marbles and 100 red marbles.  Which barrel did the red marble come from?  One.  The probability that a red marble would be drawn from the big barrel is very, very low.  The probability that a red marble would be drawn from the small barrel is not very, very low.  The fact that the marble we drew was red provides evidence of coming from the small barrel over coming from the big barrel.  This is, of course, false because there are 109 red marbles and 100 of them were in the big barrel.  Therefore, the probability of a given red marble coming from the big barrel is 100 out of 109, or just about 92%.  The problem here is that capturing Christianity is conflating a high probability of A given B with a high probability of B given A. I also don't agree that premise one is true.  Paul argued that we don't know that.  I would say we actually can be pretty confident that it isn't, at least if we accept the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.  But I don't want to turn it into one of those discussions.  The point is the argument is fallacious.  It doesn't work even if the premises were true.  That's it.  See ya. ",
