Greer is the president of the Southern Baptist Convention, and I want to watch it with you.  I figured we'd watch it together.  I'd give you my reactions in real time, and we'll just have a little fun with this.  First things first, before we even get started, I don't know.  It doesn't look like quarantine has been very good to  J.D.,  It really doesn't.  He reminds me of every white dude you see on that show Live PD when they stop people in Missouri.  It doesn't look like quarantine.  life has been very good to him.  He's as white as ever, as pasty as ever.  But he's got an important message, and I'm ready to hear it.  So let's lean in, shall we?

I was thinking about it today that my subscriber count has gone up the last month more so than it's gone up in the last quarter or so.  So thank you for subscribing, by the way, if you're new.  I appreciate it.  But I was thinking that, you know, J.D.  Greer and like Gospel Coalition, ERLC, they've got a bigger platform than me.  It's time for them to yield some space.  And I have to say that it's about time they heard the Puerto Rican perspective.  You don't really hear a lot about that.  You hear a lot about blacks.  And that's pretty much it.  You're about blacks and whites.  And I think we need some Puerto Rican perspective.  I am the Puerto Rican perspective.  And you know what?  While we're at it, I mean, I've got the native Taino Indian perspective that no one's got that perspective more than me.  And I also have the black perspective, too.  20% African slave blood in this skin, baby.  So I think I appreciate this.  I agree.  I could not have agreed with him more.  It's time to get the black perspective.  and native native perspective and i'm willing to give it.  listen i i won't even charge you i won't even make you promote my books.  all you need to do is yield some space to me and maybe bow down to me as well.  maybe don't don't do that don't bow down to me but i appreciate that it's time for you to shut up and yield space to me.  i demand it.

Black Lives Matter is a very anti-gospel organization.  He seemed to be saying that this is a gospel issue for us to support Black Lives Matter.  That's a little weird because I don't really know.  He must be saying that because I don't know a single Christian who doesn't think that black lives in the generic sense matter.  Right.  Like that's not.  that's not a position.  So we must be talking about the current zeitgeist, the Black Lives Matter movement, which is pro sexual perversion, which according to the real J.D.  Greer or maybe that one was the robot.  The real J.D.  Greer thinks that the Bible whispers about that.  So maybe he's.  maybe he is OK with that.  Sexual perversion, the destruction of the nuclear family, all kinds of socialism and Marxism and stuff.  Black Lives Matter is a horrible, horrible organization.  Horrible.  And he just said it was a gospel issue to say Black Lives Matter.  Of course, Black Lives Matter.  He must be talking about Black Lives Matter, which I know nothing about.

But like and you're entitled, like I said this in a video the other day, I said you're entitled to your own opinion and emotions, but like you're not entitled to your your own facts, like you don't have your own facts set.  And so the statistics actually are vital for this conversation.  because if one person says, well, I believe XYZ, and the other person says, well, I believe ABC, and those are opposites, and then the data says XYZ, then we know what to do there.  Like we need to correct those people that believe ABC.  And what we really need, J.D.  Greer, is actual leadership where you can correct the record, where you can say, well, hold on a second, guys.  Let's not divide the church like a couple pizzas saying that Black Lives Matter and supporting it is a gospel issue.  And the reason why it's important to say Black Lives Matter is because there's all these injustices.  But I know you have data that says there aren't all these injustices, but just ignore the data because this is a gospel issue.  Like what planet does a gospel issue include falsehoods?  And when there's evidence brought against the falsehood, you just don't talk about it because black lives matter, and it's important to say that.  Why?  Well, because obviously all black lives matter.  This is really weird.  This is a weird little snippet here. ",

But, I mean, this is why we also need statistics because we need data here because which rights and which privileges aren't being extended to black people.  That would be very helpful here.  But apparently we're not allowed to talk about that.  Don't talk about that.  Don't talk about that because then you would know that I'm talking out of my \u2013.  Anyway, that's enough of that.  A little bit of a silly mood today, no question about it.  Anyway, I hope you found this video helpful.  God bless.  Seriously, though, if you're looking for some black perspective or some native perspective or any of that, even slave perspective, I can give you that.  I got it all.  I got a lot of talents.  I got a lot of intersectionals.  And so I can give you that.  I was born in Virginia, but I was in the Bronx and I was in Connecticut and then I went to Maryland.  So I got like South, North.  I got it all, man.  I can give you anything you want, man.  Anything you want.  Just call me, JD.  Serious. ",
