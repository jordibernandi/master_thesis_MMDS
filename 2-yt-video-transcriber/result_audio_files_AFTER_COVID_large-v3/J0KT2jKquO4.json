So I've talked a lot on this channel about the many ways in which actions and words can be harmful to people of color, and other marginalized groups.  These usually involve implicit biases or ignorant perspectives which lead to mistreatment or mistrust of people, whether overt or subtle.  But what about actions and words that seem positive or complimentary?  And I don't mean insults disguised as compliments, like when someone tells a black person they speak so well, which often implies they didn't expect to speak so well?  I mean, genuine praise and enthusiasm shared specifically towards marginalized people.  Can that also be problematic?  You might have already guessed my answer due to the very posing of the question.  Hi, I'm T1J.  Follow me.  This video, like all my videos, would not be possible without my members and patrons, including homies like Zilnek, Zarina Castano, Carly D, and Wendy Bard.  Big shoutouts to all the homies, and if you'd like to support the channel, you can become a homie yourself by clicking the join button below the video or by checking out my page on Patreon.  So, I have mentioned the term microaggression on this channel many times before, and I know that depending on how it's used, it can be kind of a controversial buzzword.  Some people claim the word is used to demonize innocuous behaviors as racist or otherwise bigoted.  And some zealous activists treat microaggressions as if they're the same thing as hate crimes, which I think is a bit of an exaggeration.  But the concept that the term describes is definitely a real thing.  That is to say, the subtle mistrust and disrespect that marginalized groups face.  that doesn't rise to the level of overt oppression, but nevertheless reinforces that marginalization by constantly implying that certain groups of people aren't worthy of the same respect and benefit of the doubt that dominant groups may receive.  Examples of microaggressions are often clearly negative.  Things like a worker following a black kid around a store to make sure they don't steal anything, or when people use the word gay as a synonym for stupid, which I truly thought ended in like 2011, but apparently people are still doing it.  But there's another very specific type of microaggression that could be confused for a compliment.  That is the utilization of the so-called positive stereotype.  One of the most common ways that positive stereotypes are used is within the realm of sex and romance.  In this context, we can describe it as racial fetishizing.  Fetishizing is really hard to say, by the way, so I'm going to try to keep that to a minimum.  Now the concept of sexual fetishes can get really complicated, and that is definitely not what this video is about, so I'm not going to go too deep into that.  But it's almost certainly true that racial fetishizing is rampant in modern day relationships.  I touched on this a little bit on my video from a few years back about racial dating preferences.  While that video focused on how many societies are conditioned to uphold Eurocentric standards of beauty, I did also bring up how sexual attraction can often be based just as much on stereotypes as on physical appearance.  Often this is negatively perceived, such as stereotypes about black women being mean or angry, or Asian men having small penises.  But sometimes sexual attraction can be derived from quote-unquote positive stereotypes, such as Asian women being submissive and obedient, or Latin American people being fun and exotic.  And again, this could be genuine enthusiasm.  The problem is that in these cases, the people in question are being treated like not people.  They're being stereotyped.  They're being objectified and treated like an idea rather than a human being.  And I would like to point out that this can happen to anyone, including white people.  Objectifying people, whether positively or negatively, is probably a huge cause of relationship issues across the board.  People fetishize white people too.  There's sometimes stereotypes about white women being more promiscuous or sexually available than other women, for example.  I've read that in some Asian countries, white people are sometimes fetishized as symbols of wealth and power.  And this generalization is just as unfair to them.  They're also people with flaws and strengths and different thoughts and feelings about different subjects.  But when it does happen specifically with regard to minority stereotypes, I'd argue that it has a doubling effect.  In those cases, it's not just rude on a personal level, it also helps to reinforce those stereotypes in a systemic way.  It ultimately contributes to the ongoing treatment of already marginalized groups as something other than just people.  But this idea is not limited to just sex and dating.  The other-izing of people through a specific fixation on their race can manifest in all kinds of ways.  One example is kind of touched on in my last video, the idea of the black friend.  Some people enjoy the idea of having a black friend, not because it increases the diversity of thought in their friend group, or even because they necessarily like the person.  Sometimes they simply associate some kind of novelty and excitement with the idea of blackness, which again is ultimately disrespectful because it ignores this person's individuality as a human being and just makes them a stand-in for their race as a whole.  And of course, there are all of the common positive stereotypes that we've heard before that usually relate to some kind of skill or ability.  Asian people are good with math and technology.  Black people are strong and athletic.  Latin American people can cook and dance.  These may seem like harmless compliments, but ultimately, they imply a connection between race and skill.  And if you're saying that someone's race can make them better at something, then who's to say that someone's race can't make them worse at something?  In fact, if you take a closer look at a lot of these positive stereotypes, they often have a subtle negative implication as well.  When you're emphasizing that you think black people are naturally athletic, you're at the same time undermining other skills such as intelligence.  And this can go the other way as well.  Asian people are often expected to be smart and tech savvy, but this can undermine other skills like athletic and social skills.  Meanwhile, white people can be smart, good at sports, good at cooking, successful in relationships, and it's all good.  No one's surprised at any of that, because white people are more likely to be assessed on an individual basis, rather than being a stand-in for their entire group.  And this can be damaging to people for a variety of reasons.  Obviously, the assumption that being a certain race makes you better or worse at something is just another example of dehumanization.  This continues to encourage people to show prejudice towards groups of people as a whole rather than judging them as individuals.  But these expectations can affect the confidence and self-esteem of the people of color themselves sometimes.  When we don't or can't live up to these stereotypical expectations, we might feel like there's something wrong with us, and we might even get treated as such by people in our own communities.  If a Latina woman never learns how to cook, for example, she may be ridiculed by her friends and family, which could cause her to feel like a failure.  And sometimes, even if we do meet these expectations, we may not even get credit for them.  If we meet an Asian person who's a math genius, we might be like, well that makes sense, they're Asian.  But that completely belittles all of the studying and dedication that person probably put in to reach that level.  This video focuses on race, but there are definitely so-called positive stereotypes about LGBTQ people, women, and people from all kinds of groups.  And these things have become so ingrained in our culture that sometimes we don't even realize when we're doing it.  But as with everything else, I want to encourage people to constantly re-examine what they say and do, and put everything you think you know under scrutiny.  It's kind of exhausting, I know, but it's also kind of the only way that we can continue to grow and evolve as human beings.  That's just me, though.  What do you think?  By the way, did you know that you could watch this video as well as all of my other videos on Nebula with no ads and no sponsors?  Nebula, if you didn't know, is a secret video platform run by a clandestine organization known as the Smart YouTuber Mafia.  Just kidding.
