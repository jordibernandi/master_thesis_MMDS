Howdy, parlor.  Thank you for the messages.  I'm fine.  You know, I just want to say that this country's just really lost its way.  You know, it's good to be where a guy can't even storm the Capitol anymore without being labeled a terrorist.  I just never would have guessed I'd be held accountable for my actions.  I'm sorry, this is just a new thing for me.  I don't know what I'm going to do.  I'm on a no-fly list.  I can't get home.  They're going to... Probably take the George Washington painting.  I checked at the ticket counter.  I'm sitting at an airport Chili's drinking $13 beers.  Can I get another one?  Thank you.  They ruined my life.  is what they did.  They ruined my life by holding me accountable and I... I don't know what I'm going to do now.  I guess the only thing to do is play the victim.  I'll probably get an app sampler.  Maybe Lindsey Graham's around here somewhere still.  I could go yell at him to make myself feel better.  To make myself feel better. ",
