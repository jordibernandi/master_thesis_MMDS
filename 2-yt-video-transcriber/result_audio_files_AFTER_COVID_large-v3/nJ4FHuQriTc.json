            "text": "what is up.  beautiful family.  i hope that you guys are having a great afternoon.  i first of all just wanted to come on here and say that i am just over the moon.  um i am just really at a loss for words with you guys.  um was completely taken back yesterday.  I had absolutely no idea that the Lord had this in store for my mother.  all I knew is that I was being led to create this campaign or this fundraising for her.  I felt the Lord placed upon my heart to do it.  it was outside of my comfort zone and I just and completely blown away by all of you guys um.  so from the bottom of my heart i want to say thank you so much to every single person who has literally donated uh for my mother towards a vehicle.  i completely blown away again like thank you so much.  I had no idea that you guys were gonna raise this much.  I just like I told you guys I said it at 5,000. that's.  I didn't even think I was gonna hit that and i'm just.  i'm at a loss for words and i just will never be able to express my appreciation for you guys.  um like i said yesterday you guys are family to me and yesterday i was just like bawling all day.  I was just a hot mess and so I didn't want to come on and make a video.  But now my mom will be able to have probably a brand new vehicle with what you guys have donated.  And all I'm saying is get ready for an awesome video because she's going to literally be stunned.  so I'm leaving this GoFundMe account up until Friday.  I'm going through the process now I guess.  so I've never done a GoFundMe before for anyone.  but you have to go through a withdrawal process.  they have to verify all of your information your bank account information.  so that takes a couple days.  so I'm going to leave it up until Friday and like I said I I basically left this amount up to you guys.  so anybody else who feels led to donate um you know by the holy spirit um i'm going to leave the um the gofundme account like i said up until friday and then i'm going to see what we can do.  so um yeah i i don't want to ramble on because i could literally sit here all day and like thank you guys.  um i wanted to um get on here.  i know yesterday i promised you guys that i would make a video and tell you guys about this rapture dream that i had night before last.  and i want to um tell you guys because i want you guys to be encouraged.  i know that a lot of people are um you know having doubts.  you know being attacked by the enemy.  the enemy is making people think that we're gonna have to go through the tribulation that the lord has forgot about us that you know we can see how bad things are getting and it's it's making people question like where is the lord?  um are we really gonna have to go through like the worst of the worst?  like how bad is it really gonna get?  well are we really gonna have to go through the tribulation like why hasn't the lord raptured us up out of here yet?  um but i want to encourage you guys because the one thing that i truly remember from this dream and the one thing that just like completely stuck with me that i believe that the lord was trying to say in the dream that he wanted me to know so that i could tell you guys okay so there it was short and simple um but the lord is pouring his spirit out on all people right now on all of his people and so i literally saw it was like a gloomy, a very gloomy atmosphere, like very, very gloomy, very like, you could just tell it was like, not a beautiful bright and sunny day.  you know what i mean.  i think it just represented like just the the times that we're in like how just the world is completely corrupt and it's dying and it's sick.  you know what i mean.  um.  so it was just like really gloomy outside.  but i saw like way way way out in the distance way out in the distance.  but i it's like i saw it way out in the distance but i could almost even see it up close if that makes any sense.  but i saw like this gray like just a ton of smoke just completely just like um go up into the air like like you would see if like a bomb went off or like uh like like a gray smoke that you would see plummeting kind of like from a volcano um but it was like it was like an explosion almost like something you'd see from a bomb that just went off.  and i'm talking like loads and loads and loads and loads tons like literal tons and tons and tons of just this thick gray smoke just completely going up into the air.  so once i saw that like explosion happen or whatever i saw i'm talking hundreds if not thousands of like military personnel.  it's the only way i can describe it like tons of them everywhere all just like in the open.  i i don't know why.  just tons of like military personnel.  and then literally as soon as i saw like the explosion happened all the military personnel i heard the trumpet.  i knew without a doubt 110 like legit.  it was the rapture happening.  i knew it.  i just knew it.  i knew it in my in my soul.  i heard the trumpet and I cannot explain this, guys, but this is the most encouraging part of the dream, okay?  The Lord was speaking, like, in the dream.  I knew 110% that crap was going down and we were going up.  It's like everything completely just... hit the floor or hit the fan like people say.  and then the trumpet sounded and we flew up like we.  um as soon as i heard that rapture the uh as soon as i heard that trumpet sound we shot up.  so it was like the whole message that the lord was speaking to me in the dream.  was that because you always hear pastor tim say um when things go down we go up and now i just like not that i ever doubted him but like i just know that that is what the lord was speaking like.  i legit knew that things were literally going down right then like whatever it was i don't know i have no idea.  i just saw that huge pillar of smoke like a blast like a explosion or rocket or something.  i don't know all that military personnel and then i heard the trumpet and then we were out of there and i knew i had like that gut feeling like the lord was saying things are going down right now boom rapture happens we fly up.  so i just like felt led to share this um i stirred on it for a day or so.  i talked to my sister.  uh chrissy um not my literal sister but i call her sister she's literally my best friend.  um spoke to her about it and she was like.  you know if you feel led like you if you feel led like tell people encourage people.  and i do feel led because like um i believe that the lord is pouring out his spirit and i believe like if you take anything from what i'm saying about this dream he literally showed me that as things go down we go up.  okay.  so i don't know how much we're gonna have to see but i think what the lord was literally speaking to me is that not to worry.  okay trust him trust in him.  don't worry don't fear don't fret.  okay because we may see some bad things but we're not going to be here for like when things really go down.  so it was just like more confirmation for me.  i was just talking um to chrissy the other day and i was like.  you know i know a lot of people have doubted the lord as far as like pre-trib goes and i don't condemn people that doubt because i understand what the attacks are like.  i understand that people get attacked in their mind um but i told him like i've literally never doubted the lord as far as pre-trib goes.  and like when people ask me why like why why would you think the lord like like?  my response every time is i know my father like even like i. i know the word says that we are not appointed to his wrath.  i know that the word says that the rapture is called the blessed hope to encourage one another with these words.  okay why would we have to encourage one another with these words if we were going to have to go through his wrath makes no sense right?  and also in revelation i think it's 3 10 he says um uh paraphrasing guys it's something along the lines of uh since you have kept my uh word i will keep thee from the hour of temptation.  i mean okay it's everywhere in the bible it's super clear.  but aside from what the word says i know my father i just know him i know his goodness i know his love i know his compassion.  i think that a lot of people in this world have um been really let down by people in their lives.  you know their mothers their fathers people that said that they that people said that they loved them but they they showed otherwise.  so we've really been scarred from the people in our lives who claim to love us and care for us but show otherwise right we literally just can't.  a lot of people i feel like in me i i don't even i i can't fully grasp it right but i think a lot of people just can't understand the goodness and the love like the love that christ really has for us.  and um i just have been like shown his love more and more recently like the the way that you guys have like donated to my mother you don't even know her and yet you did it anyways and like how everybody came together as a channel family for somebody in need and the lord has literally used you guys like his vessels to do that to show his love like it's just incredible to me and like i've just been basking in his goodness lately and i just i know that the father is good i know he loves us and i know that we're not appointed to his wrath and i know that what he was showing me and what he wants me to tell you guys is that when things really go down we're going up okay.  so please be encouraged.  i know that the the enemy is attacking y'all's minds right now and making you think well we must be going through the tribulation.  um he must have forgot about us.  are we gonna have to take the mark of the beast?  am i gonna be forced to take a vaccine?  no not at all and that's what he was showing me last night.  so i just want you guys to be encouraged.  um so yeah i just wanted to share that with you guys.  Again, I'm so appreciative of you guys.  I love you all.  so, so, so much.  Thank you for making this happen.  Thank you for making this possible for my mom.  The last time she had a newer vehicle was back in the 80s, guys.  I'm just so thrilled that now we're able to give her this gift of a newer vehicle that doesn't have nasty water damage and mold in it.  in a leaking sunroof and and no ac and i mean it doesn't even work anyway.  so you know it it wouldn't even be worth you know trying to fix it and put her back in something nasty like that and i didn't even know how bad it was because she doesn't want me to worry about things.  but um so i'm just.  you know i'm in awe and i just want to tell you guys that i love you so much.  and um i can't wait to literally meet every single one of you guys someday very soon in the clouds.  so um You guys don't listen to the naysayers.  Don't listen to the people that are telling you that he's not coming.  Okay.  He prophesied that.  He said the mockers and scoffers would be out right now saying, where's the promise of his coming?  He's not coming for you.  These people that are mocking the rapture of the church.  Okay.  This is a very real event.  um jesus said we would know the times and seasons.  we know guys we're there we're just waiting.  so you guys keep occupying the time.  um you know i i get beat up a lot about occupying the time.  okay we know that the lord is coming but that doesn't mean that you stop living your life and sit on your hands and not do anything.  okay keep living your life keep doing as the lord leads you.  okay And in the twinkling of an eye, we're going to be out of here.  So I'm going to keep you guys updated with my mom and the vehicle and all that good stuff.  And I'm going to take you guys along with me.  I'm going to video it all.  And I just want you guys to really be able to see like what you have truly done for her.  I think you guys will really just feel great about it as I do.  All right.  I love you guys.  I have to go pick up my son.  I'll talk to you soon.  See ya. ",
