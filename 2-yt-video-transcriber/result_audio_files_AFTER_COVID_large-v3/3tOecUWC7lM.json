            "text": "Hi guys, this is your sister Karen Gidden in Jesus Christ.  Just with this quick update Hi guys, this is your sister Karen Gidden in Jesus Christ.  Brothers and sisters, I had a vision that the Lord gave me and I have to release it.  You know, I cannot keep it to myself, put it that way.  And I received it on the 20th, around about the 20th.  of march uh 2020 and i kind of struggle with it because i'm saying lord do you want me to release this?  you know because it is a very touchy.  it's a very touchy vision brothers and sisters.  it really i'm telling you from now it really is but nevertheless i have to be obedient to the most high because he is my boss.  he comes first over any race Whether black, white, Chinese, anybody, the most high, yeah, comes first because I listen to him.  So the Lord told me to post.  So I'm going to tell you the vision and I pray that people will not get offended.  All right.  That's all I can say.  But I pray that it will be received in love and measures can be put into place through the power of the Holy Spirit.  In this vision, brothers and sisters, I saw myself in a huge supermarket in England.  It's a very, very, very, very famous, very famous supermarket dotted all over the UK.  I'll tell the name anyway.  It's called Tesco.  OK, it's my local supermarket anyway.  It's not far from me.  It's my local supermarket.  But it's a very huge chain all over the United Kingdom.  So in this vision, it's like I was in the big branch because they have small branches and have huge branches.  So I was in a very, very huge branch in this Tesco supermarket.  And in the vision, I was aware that the man-made pestilence was going on, you know, as it is going on now.  So in the vision, that was made very, very clear to me, very, very plain.  So I was standing in the supermarket, brothers and sisters, and all of a sudden, all of a sudden, through the doors, at least maybe I would say, A hundred.  A hundred white people, both male and female, walked in through the doors.  Didn't think anything of it because I know that in real life they're putting measures in place.  Only a certain amount can come at a certain time.  So I didn't think anything of it because I just thought, okay, this is a virus that's going around, the COVID.  So they put a measure in place.  So in the vision, it didn't faze me.  I didn't say, oh, wow, where are all these white people going?  Nothing at all.  Soon as they came in the supermarket, brothers and sisters, I thought they were going to buy food and all of that.  But as soon as these white people came in the supermarket, I should say Caucasians really, white or Caucasians, it's the same name.  As soon as they came in the supermarket, they were told to join a single line.  okay so they were all in a single line.  as remember it's about a hundred of them as far as my eyes could see in this supermarket.  then i began to wonder and i'm thinking why did they tell them to join a single line?  So I looked across, well, I looked behind me.  And when I looked behind me, brothers and sisters in the supermarket, I saw five, I would say five children.  tanning booths okay these were five tanning booths and there were female and male with the spray tanning gun ready to spray these white people.  so they then said to the people you know come make your way down to the tanning booth.  so i watched these people walking in a single file coming to the tanning booth.  The first five went inside the tanning booth, brothers and sisters.  And obviously the technician or whosoever they be, they were spraying them down.  And as I was watching them spraying the white people down, obviously with tan, you know what the spray tan is like.  Once you apply it, you change color, you get a bit darker.  And so I watched the spray tan, the spraying on these people, and the skin color just changed to a much more darker complexion than what they were.  And in my heart, I began to say, this isn't right.  Something doesn't feel right with this spraying tan that they're having.  And I heard one of the guys that was spraying his client, calling his client down, he said, this is going to protect you from the COVID.  When he said that brothers and sisters to these white people that was being sprayed down with the tan, my spirit just sank because I was saying, absolutely not.  This is a fake tan.  This is not going to protect you.  Brothers and sisters, all of a sudden, all of a sudden beside me appeared an angel, full white.  tunic and trousers.  and he said to me stretch your hands out.  so I stretched the palm of my hands out and he put a lump of clay in my hand and he said to me this is ebony clay.  it was very very clear.  it was very specific with the color.  he said this is ebony clay.  now at the end of this video I went on Google and tried my very best to match the colour of this ebony clay that this angel gave to me.  So I will leave a little image of the colour that is nearest to the clay in my vision.  Very very similar colour.  So he put the lump of clay in my hands and he said, this is ebony clay.  And I began to play, you know, feel the clay was so soft, so beautiful.  And he said to me, take this clay and ask these people if they want this clay to be applied to them.  So I went to the first guy because by this time, all the five people, they all had their spray tan on and it dried very, very quickly.  So I went to the first guy and as I was walking to him, the first thing I was saying, this guy is so brown.  You know, he's like literally so, so, so, so brown.  So I went up to him and I said to him, I know that they've told you that the fake tan is going to protect you from virus.  the COVID that's going outside.  I said it won't.  I said the clay.  I said this ebony clay it's gonna protect you.  and I said um would you like me to apply some on your body?  and he said to me he said It was a bit camp, to be honest with you.  And I said, OK, darling, yeah, yeah, you can go ahead.  But he was mocking.  He was saying it in a mocking way, but because he gave me consent to apply this clay, then I did.  So I began to take some of the clay and paste on his shoulders.  Brothers and sisters, as I began to... rub the clay down in a downward motion on his shoulders.  All of a sudden, the clay dried and cracked and just fell off.  And then he turned to me and he said, you see, I knew it wouldn't work.  The tan is what I really, really want.  And this spray tan will work.  And he walked away.  I went to the second booth and it was a lady.  And I said to her, I said the same thing.  I said, the fake tan won't protect you.  from the COVID that's going outside, the disease.  And I said, but I've got some clay in my hands.  It's ebony clay and this will help you to protect you.  And she looked at me and she looked at the clay and she said, I do not want that hideous thing on my body get away from me.  So I said, okay, and I walked away.  I went to the third person, brothers and sisters.  Same thing I said, fake tan won't protect you, but this ebony clay that I've got in my hands, it will give you protection from this wicked disease, this COVID.  that's going on.  And This woman, she said to me, okay, yeah, yeah, okay, fine.  You can put it on.  But again, in a mocking way.  And as I began to put the clay on her shoulder, the clay began to slide off.  It would not stick.  it would not stick on and it'd be going to slide off.  Then I went to the fourth person and I said the same thing.  I said, ebony clay is going to protect you with fake tan water and all that.  Then she did say to me, yeah, yeah, okay, fine, go ahead.  I've got nothing to lose.  So as I began to paint this clay on the fourth person, she began to look at me look at me and said oh my days get this thing off.  i hate it.  get this clay off my body.  it doesn't match my tan can't you see?  that color is different from my tanning that i've got.  i don't want this clay on me get it off get up and i just washed.  well get piece of cloth like and just rub it off.  and so Those people rejected the clay and I was heartbroken.  Then the angel said to me, go to the rest of the people in the line that's waiting to have their time and ask them if they want this clay.  So I was going up to everybody, like a hundred of them, brothers and sisters.  And I was going up to all these white people saying, and I was explaining, this is going to protect you, this ebony clay, you know, it's going to protect you from this wicked disease that's going on.  They all rejected it.  they all think that the clay is horrible.  they hate the color.  it's the color that they didn't like brothers and sisters.  it's the color of the clay that they rejected.  i don't think it's the clay clay the actual uh the actual clay that the root is the color.  it's the issue of the color of the clay because it was ebony and when you put it on their skin it makes their skin brown you know.  so they all rejected the clay And I just woke up out of the vision.  And when I woke up out of the vision, brothers and sisters, so I'm just looking at the time.  Okay, fine.  So when I woke up out of the vision, brothers and sisters, I said, Lord, what is this?  Father, what is this?  This is a very powerful vision.  It's a very touchy vision.  It has to do with race.  People are very, very sensitive.  when it comes to white and black and Asian and all of that, what am I supposed to do with this?  And as I said to you, the Lord said to me to post it and to warn.  And the devil is a liar.  It cuts me off when I was talking, but I'm almost finished.  But at the end of the day, brothers and sisters, you can look around and you can see the nations that this COVID man-made pestilence is tormenting and causing chaos.  You know, you can see that with your natural eyes.  So I just wanted to come and to release this vision and just to warn you have to be in Christ.  You have to be in the Messiah.  You have to love Yah in this final hour.  There's no two ways about it.  Hallelujah.  Thank you, Lord.  Glory to your name.  There's absolutely no two ways about it.  So God eternally bless you.  I love you all.  And I'll see you soon.  Someday in glory.  In Jesus' precious holy name.  Amen and amen.  Amen.  Blessings.  Amen. ",
