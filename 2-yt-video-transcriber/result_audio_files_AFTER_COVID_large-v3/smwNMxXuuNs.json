            "text": "Well, we welcome you again to a live stream service this Sunday morning at Grace Community Church.  We have now for a number of months been in this same condition of being unable to meet as a church, and we have seen the effect of a virus, a virus that has had a massive effect on our lives.  doesn't affect everybody personally, but it has extended itself to affect all of us.  We have seen what a physical virus can do.  In the last three days, we've seen a far worse virus, sin, and what it will do when unleashed.  And that virus affects the whole human race.  It's indiscriminate.  And at a time when we would all admit that we need medical people to take care of the COVID virus, there's no particular interest, apparently, for those who are appointed by God to take care of the spiritual virus of sin.  This is the worst of all times for churches to be shut down.  Going back in the history of our church, I remember when one of the massive earthquakes hit Southern California, how our church was filled with people and many came to the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ.  So we are seeing a far worse example of the deadly reality of sin.  The wages of sin is death, and the only hope is salvation in Jesus Christ.  Faithful churches continue to give that message, and we trust soon they will be havens for those people not so much bound by a physical and passing virus, but those bound eternally in the virus of sin.  To begin our worship, Psalm 5.  Give ear to my words, O Lord, consider my groaning.  Heed the sound of my cry for help, my King and my God.  For to you I pray.  In the morning, O Lord, you will hear my voice.  In the morning I will order my prayer to you and eagerly watch.  For you are not a God who takes pleasure in wickedness.  No evil dwells with you.  The boastful shall not stand before your eyes.  You hate all who do iniquity.  You destroy those who speak falsehood.  The Lord abhors the man of bloodshed and deceit.  But as for me, by your abundant lovingkindness, I will enter your house.  At your holy temple I will bow in reverence for you.  O Lord, lead me in Your righteousness because of my foes.  Make Your way straight before me.  There is nothing reliable in what they say.  Their inward part is destruction itself.  Their throat is an open grave.  They flatter with their tongue.  Hold them guilty, O God.  By their own devices let them fall.  In the multitude of their transgressions, thrust them out, for they are rebellious and against you.  But let all who take refuge in you be glad.  Let them ever sing for joy.  And may you shelter them, that those who love your name may rejoice in you.  For it is you who blesses the righteous man, O Lord.  You surround him with favor as with a shield.  This is the Word of God.  Let's bow in prayer.  Our Father, we pray that Your Word would go forth with power.  The Word is alive and powerful.  It is the most powerful reality in existence.  It alone can cure the deadly virus of sin.  through the work of the Holy Spirit producing repentance and faith and belief in the gospel.  Lord, this world desperately needs Your truth, Your gospel.  It needs faithful churches.  If we could be selective in our prayer, we would say, restore the faithful churches.  and not the unfaithful ones.  Restore the places where the truth is proclaimed.  Restore the places where the gospel is preached.  And even today as we express our worship to You, and even as we turn to Your Word to see that the one great objective in life is to love the Lord Jesus Christ with all our hearts, May that become clear and fresh in our minds, maybe in a way that it hasn't before.  Bless every aspect of our time together, and we'll thank You in the Savior's name.  Amen. ",
