Why are you being a scram for it, bro?  Like, are you supposed to be black, bro?  Like, are you black or are you Spanish?  Like, come on, bro.  You don't see what's going on right now, bro.  You got a trespass order because of the way you're acting.  You don't see what's going on right now.  If you do, then you should, like.  You should see what's going on and, like, accept it, bro.  And, like, yeah, they should get your paperwork fast.  I shouldn't have to wait 30 minutes for my paperwork.  That's fine.  Trespassing, I understand.  I don't care about the trespassing.

Hey, you notice how you guys walked away and he's not yelling at me now?  Ain't that funny?  Yeah.  I'm the bitch.  And that's how it is, boys.  That's why I don't hate all cops.  If they respect our rights and the law and protect us when we need protecting, or if they feel like the law is about to be broken, that's when they should step in.  There we go.  And that's that.  I'll be clear.  I'm putting up a story.  Trust us, issue.  Thank you, all of our units.  Thank you, sir.  I'm going to put you back on that large.  All right, yeah. ",
