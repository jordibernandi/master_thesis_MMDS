And I decided, okay, it's been a little while.  I'll go ahead and check Twitter.  I'm just taking a break to check Twitter.  And... I have a million notifications.  Now, I'm used to having a lot of notifications on Twitter.  Usually I get like 20 notifications every five minutes, but I had hundreds of notifications.  Like, a lot.  So I go and I investigate, and I find out everybody's favorite gnome dumbfuck.  Keemstar Tweeted at me.  And it was like, really, really weird. ",

            "text": "It was really, really weird.  I was really confused at first, because I was like, when was the last time that I shit-talked Keemstar, and how does he even know who I am?  I'm such a comparably small figure, how the fuck does he know who I am?  So, I went and I investigated, and out of nowhere, like just randomly in the middle of the night, Keemstar tweeted this.  Fuck you at Hassan the Hun, so Hassan, and Xanderhal.  I have to admit, it actually warms my heart so much for a figure as large as Keemstar to include me along with Hassan, arguably the largest political streamer, no, just the largest political streamer out there.  Like, along with him.  That's actually, like, pretty heartwarming.  That makes me feel very, very confident.  Like, I'm there.  I'm fucking there.  I'm up there with Hasan.  That makes me very happy.  And he says, you're both complete morons.  Everyone has access to the internet and can research all of this to prove you're lying fools.  Also, my megaphone is bigger than yours, you irrelevant rats.  Now, I can understand calling me irrelevant.  I mean, it's not an argument against anything that I've said.  I can understand calling me irrelevant since I'm proportionally a lot smaller.  However, Hasan gets like 20,000 viewers on his stream.  Is he live right now?  He's live, right?  Yeah, he's got like 15,000 viewers right now.  And he's not even doing anything.  He's- he's doing ban appeals and he's gonna play Fall Guys later.  He's- look how fast his chat is moving.  He's not even play- okay.  This dude is fucking massive, okay?  So, I understand that criticism, criticism towards me, but towards Hasan it doesn't really make sense, but okay.  And then he attached this little video where he's like ranting at his computer, which he seems to do pretty often, so, uh, we're gonna go ahead and watch this and see what he has to say.  because I was really confused.  Like, what did I do?  What did I do to piss off Keemstar this much? ",

And Boblax's stream, and I talked to them about how I thought that the YouTube drama community might be a, um, a new sort of gateway to the far right, because basically, like, a lot of the narrative around this drama community right now is just hating on, like, female streamers and whatnot.  It's very disproportionately targeted at women.  So you sort of start with the anti-feminism and the blatant misogyny, and then you move down the pipeline from there.  And that was more or less the whole point of my video.  And so I went on to their stream to clarify my point.  And I also said that Keemstar is friends with a lot of alt-righters, which he is.  There's a lot of far-right people that he is amicable with, way more than is reasonable.  And I just want to point out that he disliked Augie and Boblax's stream.  He's the 31st dislike on there. ",

Who saw when Keemstar went on the trainwrecks podcast with Hasan and Destiny?  It was like a big fucking thing.  And the... The Christchurch shooting had just happened, and Keemstar was saying, we shouldn't discuss the Christchurch shooter's manifesto, because that's what he wants.  When the context was, Keemstar was literally, or sorry, the Christchurch shooter... explained his reasoning and what radicalized him to committing a terrorist attack, and Hasan and Destiny were trying to explain why this ideology is dangerous and harmful.  and Keemstar loses his shit, gets super mad that they're discussing why the motivations of the Christchurch shooter are wrong and dangerous, he got mad, bitched out, and fucking ran away.  Two minutes into the podcast.  He didn't last two minutes.  This guy, who runs a fucking drama channel, that's all about talking about controversial topics and breaking news, was too much of a bitch to discuss how to prevent and why the beliefs of the Christchurch shooter were wrong.  And he bitches out, and he left because he was scared of destiny.  So I discussed that, how he more or less tacitly defended the Christchurch shooter in his manifesto.  So I don't know if Keemstar has some hearing impairments or something.  I don't want to be ableist or anything.  So I guess we'll let him slide in that one.  It's so mad. ",

            "text": "Both sides.  Both sides.  Alrighty.  Now, this was pretty interesting for me.  I was very blown away.  Because this stream happened a while ago.  I was really, really blown away that Keemstar had stumbled across this and had gotten so angry over some comparatively very small streamer just talking about him.  He was very, very angry.  Now, we can go over the arguments he made there.  They're obviously fucking ridiculous, but I would rather just... After we go over Keemstar's Twitter meltdown, that's when I'll get into the evidence that Keemstar affiliates himself with the very, very, very far right.  We'll get into that in a minute, okay?  So he goes on.  That's nice.  Hold on.  My man.  Hold on, here it is.  So, Augie, who's the stream that I went on, says, I think you missed the like button.  And Keemstar responds, how dare you let this man come on and slander me.  He's genuinely upset.  He is genuinely upset at this point.  So, I responded... I just responded with this Pepe.  And I thought that would be the end of it.  Because usually when I get into beef with larger creators, they'll throw a few shots at me, and then I'll respond, and then they won't say jack shit.  They'll just say nothing.  But it gets even funnier it like he got he was he's invested.  He's genuinely Invested in this and I don't know if he's trolling or what but he comes off as fucking unhinged.  So what I did is I quote tweeted it and I just said he's mad and then got she hyper or whatever the name of the emote is and he responded.  and That's your response to getting called out for being a fucking liar and manipulator?  I... I can understand calling me a liar, although he's wrong in that.  But a manipulator?  What did I manipulate?  I mean, like, even in this narrative, I don't... What did I manipulate?  Um, where is the intellectual political debate?  Or maybe you don't have a point because you've just been proven wrong.  So, I say... If you want to have, if you want me, or sorry, if you want me on, or for me to have you on, I would be more than happy to, my friend, in response to that.  And he responds, wait, you think I'm going to be bait, I'm going to being baited into giving you airtime?  LMFAO!  Talk on Twitter, you herb.  I don't, I, I don't know, uh, I don't know what a, uh, Like, I don't get the calling me an herb thing, but okay.  Also, he got ratioed really fucking hard.  He got ratioed really hard by my fans calling him a beta.  It goes on for a while because he refused to debate.  Beta!  So yeah, he basically refused to debate.  Now, this argument actually doesn't hold me water.  He platformed me and gave me airtime simply by acknowledging my existence on Twitter and juxtaposing me and putting me up there with Hasan, a much larger lefty creator.  No doubt a ton of Hasan fans saw that and were like, who's this Xanderhal guy?  And then ended up following me.  So yeah, he basically already gave me airtime.  Not to mention, Team Star gives people air- that he doesn't like airtime all the fucking time.  So I can only deduce from this that he's just scared.  He's terrified of me.  So that's pretty fucking funny.  Um, and then I quote tweet him pussying out of the- out of the, uh, debate, and just said, disappointing.  Not only that, but to make sure he'd see it, I also responded- responded, that's disappointing, thanks for the exposure, I guess.  And then, randomly, like, hours later, he tweets in response.  Like, this was, like, three hours later.  He tweets, No response!  Pussy shit little kid get owned.  And then he got massively ratioed again.  Because, as many people clarified... There's some people who did it.  As many people clarified, I literally responded to him hours before.  And so I didn't really know what to say.  So I just quote tweeted it with a gnome and he got massively ratioed again.  So all I can judge by is that Keemstar comes off as like an absolute fucking... unhinged weirdo in this Twitter interaction.  I don't think this even makes him look good for his own fans.  Like, he's mad.  Like, I've set him off.  And all I can say is, as somebody who is a massive fan of Etika, and who absolutely unloads a significant amount of the blame for Etika's suicide on Keemstar, the fact that I've been able to upset Keem this much warms my heart.  I'm going to say this right now.  This one's for Etika.  This one's for Etika.  This is the most I can do for my man Etika, okay?  Nine gang for life, fuck Keemstar.  Now, why did I call Keemstar, like, or I didn't call Keemstar far-right.  I said he associates himself with a lot of people who are far-right.  Why do I say that?  Well... I think... There was another channel who said it a lot better than I can.  And how many of you guys are familiar with the Yo Mama channel.  He does, like, these animated Yo Mama jokes.  He's very, very popular.  Nearly 5 million subs.  A while ago, he did a video on Keemstar, and it's very, very good.  He basically gets into Keemstar's affiliations with the far right. ",

I'm saying... so um for those of you guys that uh haven't seen this video which you should definitely watch you definitely should watch this video for all of the uh all of the tea you know.  um basically he has some former associates of keemstar.  come on talk about his affiliations with people on the far right and he goes over how keemstar has gone on the kill stream mind you a nazi podcast where they regularly discuss the Jewish question, Holocaust denial.  I mean, you guys all know what the kill stream is.  It's the Nazi podcast.  So, although ironically, I'm pretty sure I get more viewers than them now.  I've got 11,000 viewers right now.  I'm pretty sure, or 11,000, 1,100 viewers right now.  I'm pretty sure I'm getting more viewers than them.  So... Not saying much, but they were like the biggest Nazi podcast.  So he's gone on there multiple times.  He's very, very good friends with Ethan Ralph, who is a Nazi.  He has affiliated himself with the far right plenty.  Not to mention, the dude is fucking well-known for, like, calling a dude the n-word.  You know, the Alex is a... Everyone say Alex is a stupid, you know?  Like, there's that one rant where he's like, I'm white, you're black, I look down on you, you're my slave.  Whatever that fucking unhinged racist rant he went on back in the day was.  Keemstar... has always been a piece of shit.  I don't really care to delve into and try to guess what his personal political leanings are.  All I can do is look at his behavior and the company that he keeps.  I've yet to see him befriend someone who could be classified as far left, but I've seen him become friends with plenty of people who can be classified as far right.  So yeah.  That's more or less the long and short of it.  Keemstar is unhinged.  Associates himself with the far right.  He had an absolute mental breakdown at me on Twitter.  And I couldn't be happier.  Because ironically... This is almost an endorsement of me being like a real YouTuber, you know, like an actual taken seriously YouTube creator, now that I have someone as large as Keemstar acknowledging my existence.  So, I don't know what his intentions were with all of this, I assume he wanted to send some sort of like, Dogpile of his fans after me.  didn't happen.  He's the one that ended up getting fucking dogpiled by my fans kind of backfired on him in that respect and now I just feel Very.  I feel a lot of jubilation right now at having my existence validated by a much larger online figure.  so I Thanks, GameStar.  Hopefully you recover, and I will no longer be living rent-free in your head soon.  But right now, that's clearly not the case.  So if you want to have me on your show, I'll happily come on and explain why I said what I said.  If you want to come on to my show, I'll happily explain to you why I said what I said.
