            "text": "I will say it was disconcerting to see yesterday, the first day of the Biden administration, straight out of the gate, President Biden announced that he was canceling the Keystone pipeline.  That is a major infrastructure project.  That is a project that right now today has 1,200 good paying union jobs.  And in 2021, the Keystone pipeline was scheduled to have more than 11,000 jobs, including 8,000 union jobs, for contracts worth $1.6 billion.  And with the stroke of a pen, President Biden has told those 11,000 workers, those union workers, your jobs are gone.  Mr.  Buttigieg, what do you say to those workers whose jobs have just been eliminated by presidential edict? ",

Millions, we hope.  I know that won't just happen.  We'll have to do a lot of work to make sure that's real.  But getting this right means ensuring that there are more good-paying union jobs for all Americans delivered through that infrastructure vision. ",

            "text": "I guess we should have learned by now that if there is one Republican who has a penchant for embarrassing himself, it's Ted Cruz.  Here Cruz is trying to land some type of a gotcha question on Pete Buttigieg during his confirmation hearing for his role as Biden's Secretary of Transportation.  This came in the aftermath of Biden's decision on day two of taking office to cancel the construction permit for the Keystone XL pipeline.  Now Cruz's entire argument is predicated on this idea that Biden is bad for the economy because canceling the pipeline permit eliminates 1200 union jobs.  So few things here.  One, Biden ran on eliminating this pipeline.  This isn't a surprise to anyone.  And when you get elected by 81 million Americans to enact your agenda, then it's not exactly breaking news when you enact your agenda.  And two, ending our reliance on fossil fuels will pave the way for exponentially more union jobs.  Renewables is an exploding industry, while fossil fuels is a dying industry.  And trenching our reliance on fossil fuels only makes it more difficult to transition to better, higher paying, longer lasting jobs in renewables.  That's like saying if we stop producing beepers and fax machines, the people who manufacture them are going to lose a few thousand jobs.  And we can't possibly have that.  It is as ridiculous as it is short sighted.  The fact is that renewables is the fastest growing sector in the country, with the US Bureau of Labor Statistics forecasting that America's two fastest growing jobs through 2026 will be solar installer and wind technician, both set to experience approximately 100% growth.  And that's on top of the fact that clean energy jobs already outnumber fossil fuel jobs by a staggering 3 to 1 ratio.  And those clean energy jobs offer significantly higher wages than the national average and are widely available to workers without college degrees.  It can amount to an almost 20% pay raise.  But sure, let's delay all of that because we wouldn't want to eliminate 1,200 Keystone XL pipeline jobs.  Yeah, no, makes total sense.  Consider too an argument that might prove especially resonant with Ted Cruz, and that is that by virtue of people like him staving off renewables in favor of fossil fuels, we lose out on leading the world in renewables, and when we cede that ground, guess what country picks up the slack?  China, Ted Cruz's favorite boogeyman.  China regularly outspends the US on renewable energy, for the very reason that our politicians, like Ted Cruz, have zero ability to consider even five minutes into the future.  And so now, five of the six largest solar module manufacturing firms globally are Chinese.  Even the US is importing them from China rather than producing them here.  All because a few powerful Republicans have decided they'd rather prop up a dying industry than have an ounce of foresight.  And beyond that, the vast, vast majority of Americans do not side with Ted Cruz here.  77% of Americans believe that it's more important for the US to develop alternative energy sources, such as solar and wind, than to produce more coal, oil, and other fossil fuels.  Which begs the question, why is Ted Cruz so hellbent on protecting fossil fuel companies even though more than three quarters of the country is against him?  It might have something to do with the fact that as of the 2018 election cycle, Ted Cruz was the number one recipient of oil and gas money in the entire US government, raking in almost $800,000 in one cycle alone.  Meaning that Cruz isn't out there representing his constituents or Americans.  more broadly, he's representing himself and his re-election campaign.  He's just another bought-and-sold politician shilling for the corporate interests that cut him checks.  So you might think he's being virtuous, but he's just out for himself.  Cruz even has the audacity to claim that Biden's move to cancel the Keystone XL pipeline is quote, altogether out of step with what the American people want, when in reality, it's Ted Cruz, almost uniquely, whose position is out of step with what the American people want.  The American people support clean energy jobs and transitioning away from fossil fuels.  The American people want more and higher paying clean energy jobs.  And the American people want politicians who aren't owned by corporations pulling the strings in exchange for some campaign donations.  But on top of all of that, it's especially rich for Cruz to be grandstanding about what the American people want, considering his last act was to help incite an insurrection at the US Capitol.  In fact, Ted Cruz's approval rating in his own home state of Texas has gone down since he tried to subvert democracy.  So not only is he in no position to be lecturing Pete Buttigieg on what the American people want, but he can't even get his own sinking approval ratings in order at home.  And yet still, Cruz is digging in his heels with his attacks against clean energy, not only at hearings like this one, but online as well.  Cruz took to Twitter only days ago, tweeting quote, By rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement, President Biden indicates he's more interested in the views of the citizens of Paris than in the jobs of the citizens of Pittsburgh.  This agreement will do little to affect the climate and will harm the livelihoods of Americans.  First of all, Cruz tried to disenfranchise every citizen of Pittsburgh by throwing out the election results in the entire state of Pennsylvania.  So I'm just gonna go out on a limb here, but he might not be the best spokesperson for what's in the best interest of that state.  The mayor of Pittsburgh already came out for the Paris Climate Agreement when Trump tried this same talking point, claiming that he would serve the voters of Pittsburgh over Paris.  The mayor said quote, And third of all, just because the Paris Climate Agreement was signed in Paris does not mean it only serves the people of Paris.  Kinda like how the Treaty of Versailles didn't end World War I only in Versailles.  And the fact that I have to explain that to a United States Senator is a testament to the fact that he's either incredibly disingenuous or incredibly stupid.  I'll let you make your own conclusions on that one.  So Ted Cruz will continue to grandstand any chance he gets and desperately try to raise his profile before his inevitable presidential run in 2024, but if his recent behavior has shown us anything, it's that first and foremost, he is woefully out of touch with the American people and drunk on his own ambition.  And the more people who see that, the better off this country will be, both now and in the future.  While you're here, please check out my podcast, No Lie with Brian Tyler Cohen.
