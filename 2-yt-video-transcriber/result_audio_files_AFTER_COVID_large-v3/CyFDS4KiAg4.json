I mean, this is what Mike from Around the World has been talking about.  This is what we've been talking about, that this kind of thing is going to happen.  And to the point, you know, we just had one of these over Ohio.  They just had, I mean, this is happening everywhere now.  Over Australia just a few days ago, New Zealand.  I mean, this is almost becoming daily.  And you have to understand this.  If it's happening in the cities or in different places of the world, just take that times 10 when it relates.  How many of these are breaking through our atmosphere, exploding like this in the sky over the oceans where nobody even sees it?  And we're being inundated with more and more.

Just go to www.sendmejesus.com.  That's www.sendmejesus.com.  All right?  All right.  Well, here's the deal.  That fireball exploding over Brazil... lit up the world, and it's just incredible what's going on now.  This is, as Mike said, the clusters of asteroids, the debris, and these two huge clusters are going to be going by Jupiter in late March of 2021.  And they will eventually get to us.  Be somewhere between the year 2023 and 2025.  They'll have a better feel for that.  Once the big clusters get past Jupiter.  A lot of asteroids and stuff is going to hit Jupiter.  But not all of them.  It's massive.  It's so massive.  It looks like a cloud.  two clouds of massive amount of debris that we our whole solar system our planets cannot escape.  it's going to shake things up.  well this one turned night into day.  in brazil this meteor was recorded flying over the states of rio grande and in santa catarina brazil.  okay uh it's just unbelievable and i've watched the film.  i watched actual footage three or four different camera angles of this.  it's just incredible.  the trajectory preliminary analysis showed that the very bright fireball uh began to shine uh at 89 and a half kilometers over the rural area to the east of sassas and traveling north, okay?  It was traveling at 60,900 kilometers per hour.  That's an incredible speed, about 50,000 miles an hour at an angle of 44 degrees to the ground.  The bright meteor disintegrated during the six seconds, easily overcoming the full moon's brightness and finally exploding at an altitude of 22 kilometers over the city of Vakara, which was about 15 miles.  So that was huge.  It was a sonic boom, massive.  This meteor is super luminous meteor that shines brighter than the full moon.  And in this case, the space rock was so luminous that it turned the night into day in numerous areas, even turning off streetlights.  some cities.  it was so bright and more information about this meteor and other meteors is still being tracked.  right now a lot of folks are still looking.  they realize that we're getting inundated.  now there's like Mike said Mike Brown world said there'll be no way that this can be hidden forever.  It's going to become so prevalent as these fireballs continue to break through our atmospheres, these meteorites and asteroids.  And then they're going to start, there's going to be deep impacts and there's going to be so much of this and fires breaking out.  People are going to be saying, what is going on?  I'm telling you folks, this is the sign of the coming of Jesus Christ.  And you know, there's been several articles written where I've been saying that.  It's not just the fireballs either and the meteorites and the asteroids.  Asteroids!  Asteroids!  It's not just that.  But it's also the heat, the ultra-violent rays, the cosmic rays, the CMEs.  You know, the x-rays, the radiation, the charged particles that are inundating our planet from several places.  Off the sun, because the sun is getting very active, and from the five waves of energy.  that's coming upon the earth.  And the magnetic pool by planet X, Nibiru, planet number nine, call it what you want, is according to Mike Brown of Caltech, who's over there searching the heavens with that high-powered telescope over in Hawaii, Mike Brown is saying that the already, the mathematical equation is showing a 6.5, degree six degrees.  the entire solar system is being pulled by six degrees.  uh this is an incredible revelation and development but it from a biblical standpoint it's exactly what the bible said is going to happen when the angels Begin to pour out the vials upon the sun.  The sun reacts and affects the earth and starts microwavably.  just areas, certain locations, just scorching and burning like a, just right down on top of people.  And that's already starting to happen.  And that will intensify just like the meteorites, the asteroids, all these things are going to intensify because we're living in the last days.  I mean, we're living in the end times.  And we've got scripture in the book of Revelation, in the book of Isaiah, the book of Joel, Luke 21, Revelation 8.  It just goes on and on and on of the scriptures that are telling us of these things that are coming up on the earth.  In Isaiah 24, we've even got this verse.  the Lord says in his word behold this is Isaiah 24 1 a pole.  shift of biblical proportion will happen.  behold the Lord maketh the earth empty and maketh it waste and turneth it upside down and scatter the broad the inhabitants thereof.  And it shall be as with the people, so with the priest.  As with the servant, so with his master.  As with the maid, so with her mistress.  As with the buyer, so with the seller.  And as with the lender, so with the borrower.  As with the taker of usury, so with the giver of usury.  The land shall be utterly emptied.  utterly spoiled for the Lord has spoken this word.  he even says we're gonna hear sounds in the heavens the sounds of the apocalypse.  in verse 16 from the uttermost part of the earth we have heard songs even glory to the righteous.  But I said, my leanness, my leanness, woe unto me.  The treacherous dealers have dealt treacherously.  Yea, the treacherous dealers have dealt very treacherously.  So the end of days is coming.  And look what it says even in Isaiah 24, 19.  The earth is utterly broken down.  The earth is clean dissolved.  The earth is moved exceedingly.  In verse 20, the earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard.  shall be removed like a cottage and the transgression thereof shall be heavy upon it and it shall fall and not rise again.  so again these are signs in the heavens.  now what did it say in the word it said there'd be great signs and fearful sights from the heavens.  that's in Luke 21 and and it also says there shall be signs in the sun the moon the stars and distress of nations with perplexity.  the sea and the waves will be roaring and men's hearts will fail them for fear for looking after those things coming upon the earth for the powers of heaven shall be shaken and then shall we see the son of man coming in a cloud of power and great glory.  and when these things begin to come to pass he said look up lift up your head.  your redemption is drawing nigh.  we're running out of time guys.  we're seriously running out of time and people are not saved.  the poles are going to shift the poles are going to flip The earth is going to shake.  The heavens is going to quake.  The meteorites are going to break.  And the sun is going to scorch.  And the earth is going to be like a torch.  As the fire of God continues to start to fall.  Will you be ready?  Or are you going to lose it all? ",
