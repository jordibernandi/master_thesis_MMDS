Apparently, actor Johnny Depp, sorry, that's just a trash bag full of scars.  Half a trillion.  Let me put that in context.  To lose other people that amount of money, Johnny Depp would have had to star in the Lone Ranger over a hundred times a year for 25 years.  That's a horrifying amount.  Horrifying.  The only thing we're allowed to throw billions at just to fail half the time is this man.  Vandalized Urban Outfitters Mannequin Johnny Depp.  David Beckham.  When David Beckham got a tattoo of Jesus, the response of most soccer fans was, ooh, that's huge for Jesus.  That's a big deal for him.  Neil Patrick Harris.  There's only one person who could pull off being three sex offenders at the same time, and that is Mr.  Neil Patrick Harris.  I'm not saying he is.  I'm saying he has got the performance chops to make you believe it is possible.  If he put his mind to it, he could be the literal triple threat.  He's that good.  He's that good a performer.  Bruce Willis.  Our planet is ever threatened.  We should send Bruce Willis into space.  In fact, even if our planet isn't threatened, we should send Bruce Willis into space.  That's the plan. ",

Will you marry me?  Yes.  Great.  Now that you've agreed we'll be together forever, let's discuss how Earth was colonized with alien spirits 75 million years ago by the dictator of the Galactic Confederacy.  You said yes.  You said yes.  New, useful, and non-obvious.  Incidentally, all the adjectives that Tom Cruise would say he's seeking in an ideal mate.  Matthew McConaughey.  For instance, if someone's dying and the only adult is Matthew McConaughey, maybe don't leave the decision to him.  Oh, you're bleeding out there, hoss? ",

That would be more on the mind.  He's a good boxer.  He boxes as well, apparently.  Steven Seagal.  I would say it's the last place that you'd expect to see Steven Seagal, but that wouldn't be true because that place, of course, is a movie set.  I'm just saying, he's the only action star who was literally too expendable for the expendables.  Pee-wee Herman mid-orgasm.  Ray Romano possessed by the ghost of a duck.  Russell Crowe's normal singing voice.  Nicolas Cage.  That's the only... It's been a disaster, Nicolas.  It's been a romp, but it's been a disaster.  Ben Affleck.  In America, most of us spent the last three weeks trying to figure out whether we'd just seen Ben Affleck's penis in Gone Girl.  Yeah, yes, yes.  Technically, it could have been a mink.

When you lose consciousness for three hours and wake up in Bill Cosby's limo.  But that's not the point.  That's Al Pacino sitting in a chair sugared out of his mind on baked goods saying, say hello to my little Debbie!  Say hello!  Women, what do they want?  It's a question that's plagued no less an authority than movie star and noted humanitarian Mel Gibson.  Not to be confused with his far less successful follow-up, Why are Jews?  Ah yes, nothing screams Scottish freedom quite like a millionaire Australian anti-Semite on horseback.  Oh, 1993, it was a different time.  When you could plausibly say, hey, be quiet everybody, let's all listen to what Mel Gibson has to say.  The Pope, the only person on earth who can pull off a white cape, Gwyneth.  He's the only one you look like a photo negative of Darth Vader James Bond.  Oh No I've never seen James Bond look so awkward and sad, and most of his girlfriends have died in front of him.
