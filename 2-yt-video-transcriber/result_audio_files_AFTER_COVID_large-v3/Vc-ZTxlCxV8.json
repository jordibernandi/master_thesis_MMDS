            "text": "Shalom, shalom, shalom.  Just want to get on here real quick.  Get my little spill and I'll get off.  It's voting time, family.  It's time to vote.  You either vote or you die.  Right?  That's what they say, right?  Vote or die.  Right?  And when you vote, You be prayerful about it, and you make sure you vote for the lesser of two evils.  Whatever that means.  Right?  So, lesser of two evils means they both might be evil, but who's ever less evil?  That's who you vote for.  Right?  Right?  So, like, they both probably touch kids, but whoever touches the less kids, that's who you vote for.  Or they probably You know, they both probably killed people, but whoever killed the less people, that's who you vote for.  Or they probably both cheated on their wives, but whoever cheated on his wife less, you know, that's who you vote for.  But I don't know what that means.  But we're in the season now in the time of voting.  I just want to get my spill on it real quick and make you think.  Right?  Just to make you think.  So one, I know the question may be, well, do you vote?  No, I don't vote.  I don't.  I'm not encouraging.  This video is not to encourage people to vote, not to vote.  But it's to make people think.  So why you don't vote, Josh?  Why you don't vote?  Yeah, your ancestors fought for your right to vote.  They did, and I appreciate them.  But remember, they fought for me a right to vote, so I could choose to vote or not to vote, right?  It's like the same instance, like your ancestors fought for your right to drink from water fountains, but you choose to drink from water bottles, and you choose to go to the store and buy a water bottle instead of drinking from that nasty water fountain.  You know what I'm saying?  They fought for you to have a choice to drink it.  Or like your ancestors, our ancestors fought for us to sit in the front of the bus, but some of y'all still drive your cars and y'all don't get on the bus because it's your choice.  You know what I'm saying?  It's the same thing, you know what I'm saying, with voting.  Well, why don't you vote?  Second reason why is?  I don't believe there ever will be and there ever has been a candidate for us.  I just don't believe that.  So therefore, I can't cast my vote.  And when I say never, I mean never.  I don't even, I don't count Obama as being a person for us.  Yes, most classy, well put together president, very eloquent.  I mean, probably shut any president down when it comes to world play.  You know what I'm saying?  Very intelligent brother.  Man, I mean, smooth.  still didn't get my vote.  why she wasn't for the people?  well well you gotta give obama a chance.  you know congress and and the republicans they stopped.  you know they would have stopped a lot of stuff they probably would have.  but why not try?  why not try?  you know what i'm saying.  why not try to push something through so we can see that it's been shot down?  because when it came to the lgbtq I mean, he gave them a whole month for rights, everything.  But us, it's a different story.  See, racism didn't just start when Trump got in.  You know what I'm saying?  For real.  I mean, racism been here.  He just brought it out more strongly.  You know, police killings didn't start when Trump got in.  It was Trayvon Martin, Eric Gardner, Mike Brown.  Them dudes died under the Obama administration.  I'm just pointing that out.  That's not the point of the video.  So why don't you vote?  Like I said, there's no candidates for us.  And it's like you got to pick your poison.  You either die by a gunshot or you die by stabbing.  Which way do you want to die?  How about I just don't pick a way to die?  How about I just pick to live?  How about I just don't choose either way?  There's the left wing and the right wing.  Still the same bird, flying in the same direction.  I am neither Democrat or Republican.  Neither.  Because I don't agree with a lot of things that Democrats do.  I don't agree with a lot of things that Republicans do.  I agree with some things Democrats do.  I agree with some things Republicans do.  You know what I'm saying?  But they still both have the same agenda.  You feel what I'm saying?  So there's no point in me casting a vote for someone that's not going to be for my people.  But here's the ignorance of our people.  We think something is going to change because a politician gets in office.  We think a politician is for us just because they do something cool.  Just because he put chicken, he put hot sauce on his chicken wings.  We think, oh yo, he for us.  He eat hot sauce on his chicken wings.  Just because they do the Harlem Shake.  Yo, he was busting off just because they played a saxophone.  Yo, he's for us, man.  He was ignorant.  Every four years, we get hype.  Every four years, we get excited.  Every four years, we think, yo, this is it, yo.  Man, this is the candidate for us.  Man, things is about to change this time because this one, come on, man, for real.  So, if you were to ask me, yo, Just, if you had to choose, let's say if I had to, if it came down to it, I had to choose out of Biden and Trump, which one would you want to win?  Buckle your seatbelts and let me explain.  If I had to choose out of those two candidates to win, who would I want to win?  I would want Trump to win.  I know some people just cut the video off.  Let me explain why.  I've never seen our people come together like they have in this last few months, this last year.  Matter of fact, the last 10 years of this man being in office, our people have come together.  Trump has pushed closet racists out.  He's pushed the people that you probably didn't think was racist.  True colors is shown, right?  And no, I'm not saying all Republicans is racist.  No, I'm not saying that.  Most all, but not all.  Most Democrats are racist too.  So that's another story.  But the reason why we want Trump to win is because What's going to happen if a Democrat or Biden gets in office?  We are going to get comfortable.  We won't think, yo, we good now.  Biden in office.  That was Obama's secondhand man.  Man, we good.  We ain't got nothing to worry about.  Biden in office.  And guess what?  Everything that we've been doing these last few months, coming together, buying black, supporting each other, all that's going to die.  You know why?  Because we're going to feel bad.  The fight has been won.  All because a Democrat is in office.  All because we think, yo, Biden is it.  And then what's going to happen is Biden is going to get in office.  He's not going to do nothing for us, but we're going to justify and make excuses on why he couldn't do things.  He's going to get in office, not do nothing for us, pacify us.  Because, you know, he's not going to talk crazy about us like Trump do.  He's not going to talk crazy about people like Trump do.  But he's going to be more mellow and calm.  And then what's going to happen after his four-year tenure, if he lived through it, after his four-year tenure, they're just going to bring another Trump.  And then everything that we stopped doing when Biden got in office, we're going to have to start all over and do again.  Everything that we're doing now went wrong.  after Biden do his four years and another Trump comes behind him, we want to start the process all over.  Why?  Because we got comfortable.  Because we thought, yo, this is it.  And then we're going to be sitting here chewing on our thumbs again, like, yo, what happened?  Why is that?  Then we're going to be reminiscing.  Man, I remember when we all came together.  I've never seen our people in my lifetime of 35 years living on Earth, never seen My people come together.  You got over 2 million people, 2 million black people in America open up bank accounts in black owned banks in this past two months, over 2 million.  You got so many people.  I'm gonna use black people.  I don't like using that, but black people supporting black owned black businesses, black owned businesses.  Why?  Because we figuring, yo, man, we got to support our own.  This dude is in office, man.  He ain't for us.  These politicians ain't for us.  We got to help our own.  And it's like now we're getting it.  Now we're understanding it.  Now we're realizing it.  Why?  Because he's in office.  The most I believe is using this man to wake us up and let us know, listen, this country don't care nothing for you.  They only look at you as three-fourths of a human.  Why do you think anything going to change?  400 years.  Out of that 400 years, we've been voting probably 20% of the time.  I don't know the percentage.  Ain't nothing changed.  Nothing.  Nothing has changed in the time since we've been voting.  But if we vote this year, man, it's going to change, yo.  I'm telling you, man.  If Biden get in office, man, it's going to help us.  How?  How?  Trump has helped us.  He's helped us to realize this country don't care nothing for you.  He helped us realize y'all need to focus on independence instead of equality.  This country will never look at us as equal.  And I'm giving you the honest truth.  Is it all white people?  No, not all white people.  No, come on, man.  I know some solid white people.  But us as a people, they're never going to look at us as equal, ever.  They're going to look at you as three-fourths of a human.  I don't know if anybody ever heard the story Chris Rock said, and that story always stick with me.  He said when he was growing up, this is by, I think, if I'm not mistaken, in the 70s, his mom needed dental work.  She couldn't go to the dentist to go get her teeth fixed because she wasn't allowed to go there with white people.  So instead, she went to the veterinarian and got her teeth fixed.  He said when white people found out that his mom went to the same veterinarian that their dog went to, they changed the places where their dog would get shots at because a black woman went there.  They don't even look at you as equal with their dogs, let alone themselves.  But we, every four years, we think something's going to change.  We think this is it.  We think this is the year.  When all we got to do really is turn back to the law, statutes, and commandments.  But I'm not even going to touch on that.  But it's not voted down.  Because even if you vote, that don't change nothing.  It's not going to change nothing, yo.  It means nothing.  Always say, black people are the office of mind to every movement.  We block what everybody else for.  They use us.  You have people applauding the Democrats because they put on Kente Clause and they got on one knee.  And they, oh man, they for us.  Man, you know, Black Lives Matter.  I don't wholeheartedly agree with that whole thing, but that's on another story.  But, oh man, they for us, man.  Man, we really, you know how disrespectful that was?  To see them Democrats put on Kente Clause and take a knee, yo?  They did that because they want you to vote.  That's what they did.  Because they're going to use you to get an office, but they ain't going to do nothing for you.  They're not going to do anything for you.  They're not.  So until we get in and out of it.  See what the Mosiah does, we see this throughout the script in the book of Exodus.  See, the Mosai had to let Israel know, listen, Egypt is not your home.  I know you're living good under Joseph for 70 years.  You've been chilling.  I mean, you're living in Goshen and over there, man, they're looking at you as a citizen, as equal, because Joseph is in office.  But the Bible says the Mosai rose up a leader, a pharaoh that did not know Joseph or didn't know Joseph Elohim.  And he began to persecute the children of Israel.  Why?  Because he had to get Israel uncomfortable.  He had to get them uncomfortable because Moses couldn't have came while Joseph was in office because many of his world wouldn't have left because they'd have been like, yo, man, we good over here.  What we got to leave for?  Joseph in charge.  Man, we living a life over here.  I ain't going nowhere.  We're promised land.  This is the promised land.  But he had to raise up a leader that persecuted them, that did not like them to make them uncomfortable.  Why?  Why?  To let them know man this ain't your place.  This ain't where you're supposed to be.  Israel.  It's the same thing today.  The Mosai raises up these leaders.  Just to let us know and remind us.  How much.  To stay in our home.  But y'all want to keep voting.  And vote and die.  Yo man.  Yo this is.  you know this is man.  this is what we got to do.  this is what's going to change.  nothing has changed and i know some people not going to agree with this video.  and i'm not.  i'm not here to tell people to vote not to vote.  i'm just here to make you think.  i'm here to make you think.  well well trump is a christian.  he probably is a christian compared to american standards.  i I do look at him as a Christian compared to American standards.  That's how a Christian is.  American standards.  So give him another four years.  That's what I say.  I ain't going to vote for neither of them.  I don't want to vote for Biden or him.  But if I had to, give him another four years.  Why?  Because what's going on is going to keep going.  What's going on with us coming together?  It's just going to get stronger and stronger.  Why?  Because if he gets in office, we're going to realize, yo, listen, man, we got to come together.  We got to come from under certain things and get our mind right.  We got to start looking at these scriptures and see what it is.  It's going to make us think.  It's going to push us.  But if I didn't get in office, we don't get too comfortable.  And because we get too comfortable... That's going to be our downfall.  So, I just want to get on here and speak that.  I know it's voting time.  I know people pushing you to vote.  You're seeing the commercials.  Man, don't get fooled by the hype, yo.  Please don't.  Don't get fooled.  Don't let people tell you you can't say nothing because you don't vote.  I don't want to hear none of that.  My answer is for me a right to vote or not to vote.  If I have to go vote, you got to drink from all the dirty water fountains.  If I got to go vote, you got to ride the bus in the front And you can't drive your new car because your ancestors fought for you the right to ride the bus.  I appreciate my ancestors fighting for me.  I appreciate what they did.  But now I mean, I got to do it.  They gave me a right to do it and not to do it.  I don't know why we believe just because of us passing the law ain't going to change the hearts of the people.  Do you know that?  Us?  Passing a bill or a law or legislation is not going to change the heart of the people.  Do you not know?  they passed a law and bills for us to eat at white restaurants?  And guess what?  Some people still don't want us eating there.  And it changed their heart.  Some people's food got spit in because they really didn't want them there.  But we just saw a whole bill got passed.  Man, we did it.  But why are we fighting to be somewhere where they don't want us to be?  Why are we fighting to do something that's not going to include us?  I'm just here to make you think, yo.  That's all.  Just think on it.  Pray on it.  Is the Mosai really telling you who to vote for?  I don't know.  I'm not saying he is.  I'm not saying he's not.  But I've been praying for years, man.  I ain't heard of him.  Me?  I haven't heard of him.  I remember one year I prayed.  I said, Mosai, who do you want me to vote?  He's just a solid.  I just think he was just up there like, bro, I got nothing to do with this.  Why do you want a king, Israel?  Oh, Israel, oh, Israel.  But think on these things.  Think on these things.  Pray about it.  I just, you know, just to make you think.  Is it really worth it?  Is it really worth you wasting your gas to think that you're going to change something?  Your vote ain't going to change something.  It's not.  Your vote is not going to do nothing, yo.  And I'm not here to discourage those that vote.  If you want to vote, I don't look at you no less.  if you vote.  Go ahead and vote.  But every four years, this is where we get hyped.  Every four years, we get excited.  Every four years, we think, oh, this is it.  Okay?  Just keep thinking that.  And let's see what happens. ",
