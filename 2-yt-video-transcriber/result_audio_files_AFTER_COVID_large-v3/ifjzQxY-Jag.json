I apologized, but I didn't know that apology was going to work.  He said, you apologized to me?  I said, I apologize for that, not for throwing you out, but I apologize for what I said.  He said, okay, close the straight razor, and my heart began to beat again.  So I learned about roaches.  So I learned about roaches.  So I learned about roaches.  President, in talking about the continuing recession tonight, you have blamed mistakes of the past, and you've blamed the Congress.  Does any of the blame belong to you?  Yes, because for many years I was a Democrat.  You know, someone very profoundly once said many years ago that if fascism ever comes to America, it'll come in the name of liberalism. ",
