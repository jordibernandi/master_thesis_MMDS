The averages in battleground states are showing a tighter race as Joe Biden has leads in Florida, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan.  While the president appears to have a slight edge in Ohio, of course, many of these still within the margin of error.  But the president is giving a different take on where the race stands. ",

And everybody between now and Election Day should operate as if anything can happen.  Nobody should be smug.  You know the football players who do the end zone dance on the two-yard line?  before they cross over the goal.  They think they've already scored the touchdown and they get whacked from behind.  That's what happened in 2016.  I think we have to make sure that nobody does that end zone dance too early.  Having said that, I think that... I think actually the opposite of what Trump thinks.  The media are playing it so careful now because of the mistakes that were made by nearly every pundit back in 2016, including the New York Times on the front page of Election Day, where they said that Trump had only a 15 percent chance of winning.  Everybody's so afraid now of not doing that this time that maybe they also can't see how things are going to go this year, how they more than likely are going to go.  You've got a president that has done everything he can to lose, to the point where I've been wondering some days, does he really want to win?  First of all, why would any other president would have seized the coronavirus, taken the reins, and tried to bend the hero?  Especially when this was killing, his largest demographic in 2016 was over 65.  Instead of coming to their aid and defense, he let them die.  And now we're now having this huge wave, the largest day ever with coronavirus was, I think, Friday.  You know, you've had Dr.  Redliner on MSNBC saying this could get to 2,500 deaths a day.  why Trump would be killing off his voters, historians and political scientists are going to have to figure this out in the future.  But to do that and to, you know, 70% of the eligible voters a week from Tuesday are either women, people of color, or young adults between 18 and 35.  I've just named the three groups that detest Donald Trump the most.  And that's the wave he's facing.  The people that he has offended, the people that he has made bigoted comments about, that's what's facing him now.  And the fact that he has tried to suppress the vote, has tried to make it so hard for people to vote.  Who would try to prevent people from voting other than the person who believes he's going to lose?  Because you don't want people voting.  You want to reduce the vote.  If you thought you were going to win, you'd make it so easy for people to cast their ballots, to make sure every ballot was counted, every ballot got there by the post office.  He's done the opposite.  He's just admitting then that he knows that the American people are sick and tired.  of these four years and cannot wait to see him go. ",

Do you think when you hear Trump campaign officials or just administration officials, they come out and say, look, We understand that maybe he's not for everybody, personality-wise.  But he's accomplished so many great things.  Vote for him because of his record, not because you maybe don't like the way he says something or his phrases.  I mean, is there any validity to that? ",

The coronavirus response has cost the lives of tens, if not hundreds of thousands of people.  What has been his great accomplishment?  Moving our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem?  I'll tell you, out there in Milwaukee and Flint, that really put food on the table tonight.  No, I'm telling you, he has so ruined every chance he might have had.  What he'll have is he'll have his base.  Those 63 million that voted for him in 2016, I'm confident they will be there for him a week from Tuesday.
