            "text": "Hello brothers and sisters.  What a night, what a day, what a crisis we face ourselves in right now.  This is not the time to despair.  My heart is deeply encouraged this morning.  First of all, that God rules over the affairs of men and we can deeply trust him.  At the same time, he calls us to pray and to act in times of crisis.  Years ago, maybe 20 years ago, I wrote a book called Fast Forward.  And part of it was a chapter about Esther.  And we have just completed an Esther fast.  No food, no water for three days.  The glorious thing about the Esther fast is that immediately following the Esther fast was a sudden reversal of fortunes.  This is the glory of the whole story the God of Esther, the unseen God who moves to actually expose Haman in the courts.  I wrote this years ago in this book.  The church is not at the mercy of political decrees of destruction.  Jesus is the Lord of history.  Though these decrees stand today, they will not stand forever.  God is the one who reverses the edicts of men, using the church as an agent of righteous revolution to displace kings and overthrow their decrees through the weapons of fasting and prayer.  Now, if you have been looking at the news, you may have just recently seen that in both Wisconsin and in Michigan, we see the same thing happen to 140,000 mail-in boats all over.  For Biden, none.  For President Trump.  You've got to ask the question, what are the odds that that could actually happen?  And it happened right at the same time.  I believe that Haman, I believe there are spiritual powers and those in heaven and on earth who are moving in corruption and fraud.  to us for zion's sake expose expose expose.  when we pray for zion we're talking about israel.  president trump is the greatest friend has been the greatest friend to israel.  what's going on in his uh in his um in his tenure is amazing his favorite toward israel.  i want to pray for zion's sake.  expose expose expose.  for the unborn baby's sake, expose, expose, expose.  That's what happened to Haman, a three-day ester fast.  And then a scene is brought forth where literally, literally Esther exposes Haman and a sudden reversal takes place.  I believe in the God of sudden reversals.  Would you pray with us in these days?  Expose.  Would you decree an exposure of everything that is hidden?  We want a righteous election, election that is true and right before God.  rising now and this exposure could actually bring forth a sudden shift of events even in America.  so today we say for Zion's sake expose expose voter fraud expose in Jesus name and Lord for the unborn sake we say we just declare expose expose expose in Jesus name.  amen well brothers and sisters Let's see how God unfolds through his divine providence the days ahead.  I have great hope and I have great trust in the God that rules history.  Bless you. ",
