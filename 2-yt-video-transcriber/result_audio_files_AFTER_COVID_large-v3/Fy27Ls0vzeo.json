            "text": "What's up, everybody?  James Madison Otis here.  We're right here in Myrtle Beach.  But currently here in this area, we have unauthorized vehicles to be towed and also do not enter.  But over here, we have a no trespassing sign.  So in this section, you can't go in those right there.  Even though they have signs beyond that that say like private entrance keep out, this once was... an open area to walk in.  Now it's not.  So they learned and then they adapt.  As you guys can see there, this is their department.  Go see if we can meet with anybody or talk to anybody here.  Now they have a funny little placard on the wall up here that says no loitering city law.  And then on each one of these, like down there, you can see it.  There was a statute on it or a code and now it's no longer on there.  So I must be having some kind of a council meeting or council chambers.  Bond hearings are closed to the public.  So if there's some type of a courtroom, camera up there.  So currently they're doing some type of a court in here.  So they got main entrance and public parking indicated right there on that section.  A lot of the people coming up here for court.  So it is the city of Myrtle Beach.  They hold their own court.  So if you want to talk about a biased situation there, it's the employees of the city that do it.  Probably like maybe a local attorney or something like that.  that's there.  That's pretty much what it is.  It's an unfortunate situation.  when, again, kind of investigating your own.  I don't believe you get a fair and unbiased trial.  Court.  Looks like they had a state trooper.  that's here.  I don't know if they're for court or not, but one of the state troopers in this section here in the back.  You got that sign that says no trespassing.  A lot more vehicles back here than I anticipated.  I didn't realize it was, you know, one of those things where they had a whole giant parking lot back behind here as well.  Hey, what are you doing?  Sitting in my car doing reports.  Sweet, all right.  Why are you taking pictures of everything?  Why are they taking pictures of everything?  Because this is their property.  And this is my property.  But you're on their property.  How are you doing, Trooper Moore?  How are you doing?  Can I get your license?  No.  How come?  Because I have not committed any crime in the state of South Carolina.  Okay, but you're on their property right now.  Yes, I sure am.  I haven't crossed anything that says no trespassing.  property right now.  Should I go get a detention officer?  Yeah, if you want to.  Trooper Moore.  Trooper Moore's about to violate some rights here, it looks like.  Nobody's violating your rights.  Well, come here and talk to me about it.  I'll tell you how you're about to violate them.  You're on their property.  Yes, it's a public property, Trooper. ",

So we'll see what she has to offer.  Okay.  So it looks like they're releasing someone over there.  Here.  Hi.  Yeah, Officer Dick.  Yeah.  I left a message up front.  Yeah.  Yes, she did in the front, so I don't want to waste it twice there.  So you got called here, apparently, right?  Did it say that again?  You got called over here for me?  No, I just saw you walking around, so I came in.  You saw me walking around from the bushes, and there's another guy walking around over the bushes?  Yeah, I got to walk to my car.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Oh, nice.  And she made contact with a trooper over there that went to cry and whine about me filming?  Is that what it was?  I don't know anything about that.  I just walked out, and someone said you were out here filming, so... So you walked out, and someone said they were coming out here filming, or you just saw me walking around?  See, this is how... That's awesome.  How's your officer Flannery?  Very cool.  I like meeting.  Yeah, you have some reddish hair.  I'm meeting a fellow ginger here.  But yeah, we're officer Dick did a, you know, an admirable thing.  Give me a second.  How's it going?  Get back in the car and do your work.  Get back in your car and do your work and leave me alone.  Trash back in there.  I don't like people like that.  So Officer Dick basically, you know, did some tweaking of some arms on a lady that was out at the beach wearing a thong and stuff like that.  Probably made some major news on here, so I wanted to do an interview with him and see if he would, so.  Okay.  Yeah.  Okay, so you've already called for him?  Yeah, I called for him.  So you're just waiting for him?  I'm just waiting for him.  So, yeah, so Trooper Moore over here, she wanted to ultimately just try to violate some rights by me filming and doing that.  She's like, you're on their property.  Whose property is this?  All right.  Authorized personnel.  But I'm saying like here, I didn't go back there.  I'm pretty smart with the law and making sure that I don't violate anything.  But all this in here, this little area where you can come and walk like a little park that set up a fountain.  But anyway, that was that.  And do you have any questions for me?  Yeah.  Do you have an ID number or anything like that?  My badge number is 367.  367.  OK, very cool.  The other the only other question I have is. ",

Thank you.  Yeah, what I was going to say is, like, you know... I listen to the radio, you know, being law enforcement myself, or was, not is.  Oh, where?  Oh, nowhere.  I don't tell it out.  Because then you've got an officer more that might get that information, and then she starts calling the locals and, hey, listen, hey, real quick, I just want to tell you, you've got a guy that's out here filming.  You might want to be able to drive by his house, which happens.  But what I was going to say is that... ",
