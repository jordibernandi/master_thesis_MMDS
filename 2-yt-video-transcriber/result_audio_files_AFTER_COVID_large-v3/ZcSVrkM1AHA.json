            "text": "Hi guys, this is your sister Kerrianne in Jesus Christ.  Brothers and sisters, I want to release this vision that I had sometime last year.  I cannot remember the exact month and date, but I know it was in 2019.  Very powerful, very powerful, very powerful vision, brothers and sisters.  In this vision, I saw Kanye West, okay?  And he was in a room lying on the bed.  And it was like two separate rooms.  So he was in one room.  And in the second room was the Kardashian sisters, all of them.  I didn't see the mom, but I saw all the sisters together.  And the room that they were in, they could see Kanye.  okay and it was like myself.  i was in another room and i could see everything.  i could see both kanye in one room and the kardashian sisters all right in another room.  so as i begun to look at the sisters i was noticing the way how the dress they were all wearing this long uh Off-white, I would say.  Off-white dresses, you know.  And they had what appears to be strings in their hands.  But the strings, it was like they were wrapping it on... a stick was really weird but they had like white thread.  i call it thread but it's really string really and all of them had it all.  the sisters had these strings and they were wrapping it and unwrapping it.  so they wrap and they unwrap you know.  so that's the action.  and they were.  they were pacing to and from Kanye West's room.  Well, actually it was Kim who was doing the pacing back and forth in Kanye's room.  So as I was watching this observation and then messing about with the string on the stick, I started to look on Kanye West lying on the bed.  And as I was observing this guy, Brothers and sisters, there was two lights emitting from Kanye.  First I saw a bright, beautiful bright light and I knew that was the light of the Lord.  I knew it because I recognized that light.  It wasn't a fake one, it was.  But it did not shine for long.  And then that light went and then darkness came over him.  Then the Holy Spirit began to speak.  And he said to me, whenever you see my light, which is the bright light, go in the room and encourage Kanye.  So I saw, and it was like, I had to, because the light was flickering so quick and so fast, brothers and sisters.  So I had to wait until I see this bright light.  As soon as the bright light came, I rushed in the room and I basically encouraged Kanye saying, you know, stay strong, stay focused on the Lord.  He loves you.  And then I saw the dark light came and I had to run out of the room.  So that was the... the back and forth that I was doing.  Whenever the dark light came, that's when Kim Kardashian, that woman, anyways, yeah.  That's when the dark light came over him, Kanye.  That is when Kim comes in with her string, wrapping it up and unwrapping it off this stick thing, you know?  And so that was going on back and forth and I was going in the room and she was coming when the dark light and it was like that.  And as I observe Kanye on the bed, brothers and sister, cause it was lying on the bed and it was just lying very, very still.  In my spirit, I recognize that this guy wants to break out, but you just don't know how, you know, and, and the vision, the vision ended, the vision ended there.  And when I came out the vision brothers and sisters, and I've done a video about this, I've called out the Kardashians that they're witches.  And I know some of you are massive fans of them and that's fine.  And you can come after me.  That's okay.  But I'm telling you who these girls are.  They're literally witches.  They do enchantment spells and just spells to draw people in brothers and sisters.  and you know yes Kanye is married to Kim and has some beautiful kids but this woman is a witch and she is Kanye West's handler meaning that Kanye is underneath her spell.  there's certain things he cannot do.  um and his it's, well, so Christianity falls religion into really, really fake.  But, let's put it this way his walk with the most high yacht is hampered by that woman and the family.  because you see Kanye is still underneath the Babylonian system.  a lot of people come emailing me and even commenting some of my Kanye West videos and all sister carrying.  you told the world that Kanye is going to be a Christian one day and look at him.  he's pretending now when Kanye is truly safe Because the Lord is working on him.  There are people brothers and sisters.  That Yah is working on.  Okay.  But because of disobedience.  And just don't want to let go of certain things.  There's still one foot here.  And one foot with the Lord.  And you cannot do that.  Because lukewarm.  is no part of that?  you're either for him or you're not.  at this moment in time unfortunately kanye is still underneath the babylonian system.  he still runs around with the wicked hallelujah.  so to come out and say oh he's a christian he's walking with the most high.  yeah uh no he's not he's he's not but he will get there.  um because number one a true child of god do not celebrate halloween.  he saw him the other day.  halloween just gone dressed up like I don't know what, you know?  And Eastern, all these things.  You don't do that when you come to the Messiah.  You put down pagan things, but you can see the paganism in his walk with the Lord.  And a lot of things as well, you know?  But yeah, his wife is literally a witch.  She really is, Kim Kardashian.  The sister, the whole lot of them, from the mom go down, they're all witches.  And she handles... Kanye West in a spellbound way.  I cannot explain this handler thing, but that's the word that came to me.  That's the word that the Lord told me to use, handler, okay?  So the Lord has his hands on Kanye's life.  He's got a calling, but he's not walking in his purpose yet.  He will, he will, he will.  But he's got to go through some things.  He's got to lose a lot of things, brothers and sisters.  We see a little glimpse of what he can do when he full-fledged comes to the Lord, okay?  And just because you've got a choir that can sing beautifully, because he does have a choir that can sing, they're talented.  But... There's a difference, brothers and sisters, there's a difference between talent and the anointing.  Massive difference, okay?  It's like some preachers, some people can really, really preach, got loads of head knowledge and they can preach.  But it's the anointing that makes the difference.  Hallelujah.  It's the anointing that makes the difference.  And so yeah.  I just wanted to come.  You know.  Okay.  I just wanted to come brothers and sisters.  And release this vision.  I had it 2019.  But I'm ready to release it.  Maybe because.  I think maybe.  Kanye is back in the media.  And he's having a mental health breakdown.  In what a view.  But.  He's going to come, like I say, he's going to come to the Lord because I saw him in a vision.  I've released that vision as well.  I might put it in the description box if I remember.  So just check the description box if I put that vision in there.  But yeah, a lot of things I can say that the Lord showed me.  One of the things I will say this, might as well just go ahead and say concerning Kanye.  Now, the media have painted him, Kanye, as insane.  There's a reason for it.  Don't just think that they're just going to do that.  There's a reason for it, brothers and sisters, because you see, when the Lord totally released him and he begins to speak truth, One of the things that they're going to come out and say is that he's full-fledged mad.  Do you understand what I'm saying, brothers?  So that is to put down his credibility when Yah begins to move with him.  And one of the things, and I'm going to mention this, and a lot of people, you might know, but anyways, I'm going to say, because one of Kanye's, fulfillment is to wake up to help help the awakening of the 12 tribes of Israel because once he is awakened and Yah is going to awaken him just like Nick Cannon who came out and said you know these are that people are the true israelites and he created a massive problem.  he lost his job.  they fired him this that what?  what have you?  you know the story and i think now he's backtracked isn't it canon?  he came out back and said he's very sorry and he apologized to jewish community and basically said you know the true israelites are not people of color, one of you.  So Nick Cannon is sold out anyways.  You know, he backtracked it.  So you saw a glimpse of that by coming out and declaring who the true children of the Mosiah is, gonna stir up war.  And when Kanye comes out, because he will, and when he comes out and he begins to talk and he said, look, African Americans, this is who you are, and people begin to listen, Yeah, they probably tried to assassinate him or something like that.  It's gonna be deep.  This is deep, brothers and sisters.  This Kanye thing, it is so deep.  It is so, so, so deep.  But your hand is on his life.  I can tell you that confidently.  Confidently.  The most high your hand is on his life.  And he's going to be used mightily in these end days.  All right?  So keep him in prior.  My... My hope is that Kim will put down the witch's stuff and give her heart to the Lord.  But hey, sometimes when you're taking over, you know, it's very difficult to come out of what you know because of the rich and the fame and all of that.  You know, the Kardashians I'm talking and all of that.  And they're not the only one in Hollywood that's witches.  The whole lot of them.  yeah from beyonce rihanna katie perry a whole lot brothers and sisters.  these people the things that they mix up in is crazy.  the holy spirit has to show.  you or those who once were in it and come out will have to come and tell the story.  but this thing is real.  so be bold be strong be courageous.  walk with yah just like enoch.  All praises, all praises to the Most High, Yah, who lives above the heavens.  Yah, eternally bless you.  I love you all and I'll see you soon.  Someday in glory.  In Jesus Christ's precious Holy Name.  Amen and Amen.  Amen.  Blessings. ",
