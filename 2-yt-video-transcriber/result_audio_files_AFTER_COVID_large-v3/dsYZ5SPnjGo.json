That which leads you to destruction is not freedom.  Therefore, freedom to practice false religions is not freedom of religion.  Freedom to blasphemy or idolatry is not freedom of speech or expression.  For how can that which oppresses our very souls be called freedom?  We must bring back the commandments of old and put to death those who pervert the Scripture by claiming Christ unbound us from the law.  Christ himself told us unequivocally that he came not to abolish the law, but to fulfill it, and that those who set it aside will be called the least among us.  So we too should never again fear calling those people what they really are.  The least among us.  No, Christ did not change the law.  He made it more clear than ever before.  There was a time when we put heretics, murderers, and adulterers to death.  We shall do so again, but this time we will not be led astray, for we will fully commit to the word of God, the holy word that says if you have anger towards your brother or sister, you have committed murder.  And what do we do with murderers?  With love, we send them to God for righteous judgment.  The Holy Word says, if you look at another woman with lust, you have committed adultery.  And what do we do with adulterers?  With love, we send them to God for righteous judgment.  Resistance against the great renewal of the old order is resistance against God Himself.
