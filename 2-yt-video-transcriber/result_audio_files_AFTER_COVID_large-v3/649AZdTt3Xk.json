            "text": "Hello, Carlton Pearson here.  Light is universal.  Light is powerful.  Light is what you are.  You cannot stop being light.  Light always overcomes darkness.  Darkness never overcomes light.  I don't care how dark a room is.  You can light the slightest little candle and the darkness passes away and moves away and moves away.  It's not the other way around.  You can have pitch black darkness.  Somebody lights one light or the light is shining and the darkness cannot overcome it.  So don't stop shining just because someone is intimidated.  Buy your light.  Be the light.  Bring the light.  Earn the light.  Love you. ",
