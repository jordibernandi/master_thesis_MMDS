            "text": "First of all, never heard from again accurately describes at least nine of the twelve disciples after Jesus ascends to heaven.  After showing up in disciple roll call in Acts 1.13, the Bible never again mentions ever any action of andrew philip thomas bartholomew matthew james son of alpheus simon the zealot or judas son of james.  james son of zebedee gets a single mention but just to tell us that he died.  of the twelve only peter and john are mentioned again.  in the bible Church tradition about these men began centuries later in unreliable apocryphal traditions.  I'd invite you to read Dr.  Sean McDowell's book, The Fate of the Apostles, to affirm that we do not know what happened to these men after Jesus ascended.  In his discussions with me, Sean has put forth what other Bible scholars also argue about the word apostle.  They affirm that Paul and other church fathers use the word somewhat fluidly as a generic term, not necessarily pointing to specific individuals.  But they also argue that the author of Luke Acts always uses apostles to be synonymous with the Twelve.  While I feel this argument is very much begging the question, if I were to grant that... All it would mean is that these men disappear into history in Acts 4, rather than disappearing in Acts 1.  Regardless, yes, Mike, they were never heard from again.  Second, Mike seems to be implying that no book could ever be written with inaccurate information.  as long as some human is alive who could correct the book.  This is laughable on its face.  Books are published every day containing huge errors, lies, and omissions that are correctable by other living human beings, but that go uncorrected for some reason.  Or people do attempt to correct them, but don't have an adequate platform to do so.  Or people just don't pay attention.  People don't pay attention to corrections, they pay attention to the first headline.  Lance Armstrong's 2001 autobiography, It's Not About the Bike, My Journey Back to Life, continues to sell very well on Amazon, despite being entirely discredited when in 2013 he admitted to cheating with steroids.  James Frey's memoir about his harrowing 86 days in prison, A Million Little Pieces, was chosen for Oprah's book club, despite the fact that Frey spent only a few hours in jail.  The major events of the story were fictitious, yet the book became famous as a true story.  Relatively few who read it initially would have heard about the deception discovered three years later.  Millions have watched Netflix's recent Last Dance documentary, but only a few heard Chicago Bulls historian Sam Smith's interview on radio station 95.7 describing areas where the documentary, and Michael Jordan himself, lied or fabricated details.  Is this correction preventing the Last Dance version of events from being presented as truth in the mind of the populace?  Not at all.  Third, were Peter or John actually in a position where they could correct any exaggerated claims that made it into the Bible canon?  Well, tradition holds that Peter was killed by Nero in 64 AD.  And when does Mike think that Mark, the first authored gospel, was written? ",

Apologists tend to insist that the author of John was unaware of the other Gospels, in order to hold it up as an independent source.  In this scenario, John could not issue corrections to books he was unaware of.  Can't have our cake and eat it too.  On all sides, the argument that disciples would have told us if there were exaggerations is ridiculous and ultimately an argument from silence.  It's entirely possible.  the disciples were out there every day disagreeing with the Gospels, but those objections simply didn't survive until today. ",

How did you compare this against the likelihood that the authors of Matthew and Luke were hoping their versions would supplant the Mark version that was being read aloud in the churches, and that piggybacking off of familiar material would be a good way to gain traction?

Well, turns out Eusebius himself calls Papias a man of very small intelligence.  and characterizes his work as including strange parables of a savior, and statements of a rather mythical character.  We already have conflicting death stories of Judas in the Bible, but according to Papias, Judas swelled up, Violet Beauregard style, and couldn't even fit in a wagon.  But instead of blueberry, Judas was filled with pus and urinated worms.  Sounds legit.  What we know about Papias is that he's not considered smart, makes up details, and most of what he said is unanimously rejected by scholars new and old.  But by all means, let's find out what he has to say about the author of Mark. ",

Before we declare this to be amazing, because of the speculative timing and self-authority promised by an acknowledged exaggerator, Can we take a second to see what he says.  that has you so excited?  When Mark was the interpreter of Peter, he wrote down accurately everything he recalled of the Lord's words and deeds.  Mark did nothing wrong by writing some of the matters as he remembered them, for he was intent on just one purpose, to leave out nothing that he heard or to include any falsehood among them.  It's interesting that Papias says Mark's purpose was to leave out nothing that he heard, and then associate that description with the shortest gospel, the gospel with the fewest stories, or pericopes as the New Testament scholars like to call them, and is the gospel with no birth narrative, and no post-resurrection appearances.  The truth is that since Papias doesn't quote the book that he's attributing to Mark, we have no idea if the gospel found second in our New Testament is the book he's referring to or some other document altogether.  Based on his description, there's little reason to think it's the same one.  It wasn't until 50 years after Papias that we have the first connection between the name Mark and the contents of our second gospel, even though that second gospel was quoted by church fathers for decades without attributing it to Mark.

            "text": "three hundred years after jesus death we have an author quoting another prone to exaggeration author from two hundred years before that who describes a book that a friend of a friend wrote in a manner that doesn't match the book we're talking about and that's the superb evidence that mark wrote our second gospel.  you and i have very different ideas about.  superb dr So, to sum up, Mike was asked if the stories about Jesus might have become exaggerated before they were written down.  And his answer was that, 1.  The disciples totally would have said something if there were exaggerations in the Gospels, despite disappearing from history and probably not being alive at the time.  2.  There are a few vague things written down only 20 years after Jesus' death that are the same as what was written down 40 years after Jesus' death, so obviously nothing could have been exaggerated in those first 20 years.  3.  The guys who wrote things down 50 years after Jesus' death copied the guy who wrote things down 40 years after Jesus' death, so obviously nothing could have been exaggerated in those first 40 years.  four mike has read the mind of the guys who wrote things down to confirm that they super wanted to be historically accurate in writing down the stories.  they didn't witness.  therefore the stories couldn't have been exaggerated in the forty years prior to the author's hearing of them for some reason.  and number five the friend of a friend of someone who might know, said that the guy who wrote things down 40 years after Jesus' death knew a guy who knew Jesus.  So obviously nothing could have been exaggerated.  And yet somehow, I'm not convinced.  Are you?  Or have I misread my exposition?  Let me know in the comments.  Now, might I recommend this video, where we take a look at more of the New Testament claims.  I'll see you over there.  Until next time, later. ",
