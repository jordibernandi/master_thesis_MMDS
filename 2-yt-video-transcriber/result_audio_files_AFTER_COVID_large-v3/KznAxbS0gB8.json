Millions of us are struggling and increasingly desperate, and Congress needs to get its act together.  So join our national advocacy campaign for cash relief.  Let's have Congress do the right thing, do what 82% of us know is necessary, and that's cash in our hands right now.  If you want to help pound this message into Congress, donate now.  We're going to take that money and then we're going to help them on the head with it. ",
