And I was like, yo, what do you mean?  He definitely acknowledges that there is some out there, but I think once we discussed it a little bit more, he opened up to the idea of it a little bit more.  But I 100% believe in female privilege.  I think that female privilege is more than anything else.  They talk about white privilege and white men and all this stuff.  Female, period.  I don't care what color your skin is.  I don't care anything about you.  If you're a five or above, you 100% benefit from female privilege.  It happens in the court systems.  It happens with police.  It happens in work, job situations.  I mean, look at it right now.  If you are a female and you go to school for engineering, you are 100% going to get a job over top of all the men.  All the men.  You're going to get special privilege right on top.  Even if your scores in your transcripts were half the grades that the men had, you're going to get special privilege just for being a female. ",

It's a nurturing thing that's built into you from generations and decades and eons of evolution, you know.  But you see these stories all the time.  Like I was just discussing you the story with it.  And I want to say I did a video on this a while back.  But we were talking about there was a woman who had a \u2013 she was pregnant.  She had her baby in a McDonald's bathroom.  She drowned the baby in the toilet.  This is a true story.  You can look it up.  I'll try to find it and tag it in down below so people can look at it.  She drowned the baby in the toilet.

And they were sleeping with the kid.  They rolled over on the kid and they go to jail and they get hit with all these crimes and everything.  And here's this lady literally kills this kid and gets partial custody to it.  Now, the other story we were talking about too was the kid from \u2013 what school was that?  Shit, I can't remember what school it was.  Columbia?  Columbia University.  And he got hit with a Me Too claim because the girl was at a party.  The girl wanted to have sex with him.  He didn't want to do it because she was too drunk.  He kept kind of saying like, hey, listen, I don't think that you're in the right state of mind.  And he was smart enough that he pulled his phone out and he recorded the entire interaction.  Yeah.  And there's transcripts of it.  Hilarious transcripts.  If you look this up, Columbia university story, the transcript is great.  I mean, she's like begging for it.  And he's like, listen, I don't know, man, this doesn't feel right.  And like, I'm going to get going.  And she's like, well, then they start hitting you with, they try to attack your masculinity at that point.  So then it's like, well, what are you not?  You can't get it up.  You've got a small, yeah, you can't get it up.  You got a small miss.  Um, you don't think I'm pretty.  You don't think I'm this.  And they start getting all these emotions going.  And he leaves.  And her roommate was even home.  Her roommate was like, or not roommate, but whatever, doormate or whatever.  And he goes out into the common area and he just leaves her there.  And he records himself all the way out to the street walking away and everything.  The next day she hits, claims that he sexually assaulted her.  Yeah.  And the school automatically goes after him.  He goes, look, I got audio.  I recorded the entire interaction.  I kind of seen this coming.  I felt like this was a really bad situation.  I didn't want to be in.  And I backed myself up.  Smart.  Smart.  Genius.  Who even thinks like that?  Genius, right? ",

They revoke his degree, which, by the way \u2013 On a side note, they were talking about \u2013 we'll get political for one second.  They were talking about \u2013 Harvard.  Harvard was talking about pulling the degrees of conservative people that supported Donald Trump like Dan Crenshaw and Kayleigh McEnany and pulling their degrees from them.
