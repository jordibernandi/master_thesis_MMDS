They say she was the highest-ranking woman in the Five-Nine Brims gang.  That's a subset of the Bloods street gang.  She's also accused of putting out a hit on a bartender she thought was having an affair with Cardi B's husband, Offset.  In recent years, Brim has become a bit of a social media celebrity with nearly a million followers on Instagram.  She also appears on Cardi's account regularly. ",

Both of Star Brim's indictments are RICO indictments. ",

            "text": "Now, for those of you who don't understand how RICO works, Here's a quick lesson.  Ricoh doesn't go after individuals, but it goes after criminal organizations.  See, just like any other company, you have groups of people carrying out various tasks, and you have people doing things like payroll and HR, and all of them are working in furtherance of the organization.  Now, some people are motivated by their paycheck, and other people are motivated to move up in the company.  For example, I worked in the DA's office.  Now, I was a prosecutor.  but we also had an HR department.  Now, I didn't know what they did in HR and they didn't know what I did at my job, but we were all working together to further the goals of the DA's office.  Now, in a corrupt organization, it's the exact same thing.  You have some people working in prostitution, some people working in selling drugs, some people working in recruitment, but all of those people are working to further the organization.  Now, this could be either Your conventional street gang, like the Blood Street Gang, or this could be like the Mafia.  Now what RICO does, it allows the government to hold everyone involved in a criminal organization accountable for the crimes committed in furthering that organization.  From the people selling drugs to the people doing the recruiting.  Now even if the defendant is not aware of the other crimes being committed on behalf of the organization, they can still be held accountable.  Now because the government has to prove a defendant is part of a criminal organization for RICO to apply, It's extremely foolish to admit that you're involved in a criminal organization.

            "text": "So now let's talk about the timeline of events with Starr Brim and Cardi B. So again, these are allegations.  Federal prosecutors and state prosecutors allege that on October 15th, 2018, members of the Five Nine Brims carried out a violent assault against bartenders at the Angel Strip Club in Flushing, Queens.  Now, prosecutors alleged that they carried this out because these two women didn't show the proper respect to another member of the gang.  Now, most news reports will tell you that one of these women, one of these bartenders, was alleged to have slept with Cardi B's husband, Offset.  Now, Star Brim, who was serving a federal prison sentence at the time, commissioned the younger members of the Blood Street gang, and she called them drops.  And she said to, quote, pop that bottle on the bartender, stating that I want hands put on them.  I don't even want no talking.  Now, that night, defendants Jeffrey Bush, Louis Love, Rodolfo Zambrano, and three of Raspass's drops met at Angel, where they lured one of the bartender's across the bar, and while holding her by the hair, they began to beat her and throw bottles at her.  Now, Bush recorded the assault on cell phone video, and the video was sent to other gang members on behalf of Rest Pass, who allegedly ordered the attack.  Rest pass is Starbrim.  And again, this was all allegedly because one of these bartenders was sleeping with Cardi B's husband.  So Starbrim was charged with conspiracy to commit assault in the aid of racketeering.  And this was in the Eastern District of New York.  And for that charge, she is facing 20 years in prison.  So two weeks after that, Cardi B went to the same strip club And then she allegedly ordered the bartenders to be beaten again.  Now, Cardi B's next court date is March 19th, 2020 in Queens.  Now, Cardi is facing 12 counts.  And on top of that, she can face up to a decade in prison if found guilty on all counts.  Now, all of those incidents happened in the Eastern District of New York.  Now, gotta fast forward one year later to the Southern District of New York.  Now, on August 8th, 2019, why do they love to do this stuff in August?  Jamar Simmons, Albert Shoulders, Sylvester Wendt, and Star Brim maimed and assaulted an individual with a dangerous weapon and aided and abetted the same by slashing the individual in the face.  Now, Starr Brim and her accomplices slashed the individual in part to maintain their increased position in the Five Nine Brim's racketeering enterprise operating in the Southern District of New York.  So the Southern District indicted Starr Brim on one count of conspiracy to commit racketeering, which she could face up to 20 years in prison.  The second count is maiming and assault in the aid of Akaterin.  And she is facing 30 years in prison.  So at the end of the day, Star Brim is facing 70 years in prison.  And Cardi B is facing about 10 years in prison on state charges.  So now you know what's up.  Like what you heard.  Hit that subscribe button.  Leave a comment.  Let me know what you think.
