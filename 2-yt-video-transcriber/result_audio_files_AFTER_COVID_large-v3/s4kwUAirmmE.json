What I've done is the 21st Century Cures Act in the last two years of Barack Obama, the CARES Act.  after that produced a total of $275 million for Kentucky.  In that $275 million was the single largest grant in UK history, $87 million, the single biggest grant they've ever got.  In addition to that, there are these law enforcement areas called HIDA, High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas.  I've gotten a number of those for Kentucky so that roughly half of our state is covered by this combination of law enforcement and social workers working together to go after these very, very intense drug trafficking areas.  So we're still fighting the battle.  Not over yet.  But my cloud has made a huge difference in providing funds for Kentucky on this big problem. ",

He's incapable of doing it because he gets the most money from Big Pharma than any member of Congress last cycle, last year.  That's why.  He's basically bought off.  But what we really need in addition is more resources for treatment and prevention to include making sure that we don't take away the Affordable Care Act.  Because what Senator McConnell would do was take that away, take away the Medicaid expansion, where 50% of our fellow Kentuckians who are addicted get their treatment through Medicaid.

Because, of course, on this issue, yes, Mitch McConnell is in the pocket of Big Pharma.  Here is some evidence of that from Courier.  Here's how much McConnell got from Big Pharma after nixing a bill to lower drug prices.  Senate Majority Leader said in September that he would not allow a vote on the Lower Drug Costs Now Act.  said he would block any consideration of a bill to lower prescription drug costs.  By the end of December, he had raked in more than $50,000 in contributions from political action committees and individuals tied to the pharmaceutical industry.  And I will link to this below the video in the description box under sources.  You can go through these links.  They go into depth on this.  They have actual links to the FEC filings of the various donations that he received from the pharmaceutical industry.

            "text": "I wish.  I wish McGrath backed single-payer health care.  I, as somebody who has single-payer health care, understands all the misinformation put out there by people like Mitch McConnell about single-payer health care.  There is a reason why every other major country has some kind of universal health care system.  There is a reason why Canada has had single-payer under both conservative and liberal governments, and it has not been dismantled.  If single-payer health care was so bad, then why haven't Canadian conservatives dismantled it?  Why haven't we moved to a U.S.  health care system?  It's because single-payer is incredibly popular.  Mitch McConnell knows that.  He is lying to people.  So, of course, that is one of the major issues with Mitch McConnell is his constant attacks on health care.  And Obamacare, of course, does not... do what is necessary.  It is a right-wing health care plan, a private insurance health care plan.  That said, it covers people with pre-existing conditions, and it gives people more health care than they had before Obamacare.  And right now, yes, they are trying to get rid of it with the new Supreme Court potential pick.  So here, Donald Trump tweeting out, Obamacare will be replaced with a much better and far cheaper alternative if it is terminated in the Supreme Court, would be a big win for the USA.  Of course, Trump has no health care plan, has discussed health care for five years, says he has a great plan, has never shown this great plan.  He has no plan at all, just trying to get rid of Obamacare.  And to be fair, though.  To be super fair, when it comes to Amy Coney Barrett, there is some disagreement on whether or not she would be able to overturn ACA with the hearing that is happening a week after Election Day on the Affordable Care Act.  So according to some people that it's... It's very unlikely that Obamacare will be struck down during that case.  So just quoting here from Law and Crime, I spoke Monday with University of Iowa College and Law Professor Andy Grewal, who has written extensively on Trump-related legal issues.  He agreed that casting Barrett as a villainous vote against the ACA is inaccurate.  Quote, whatever constitutional concerns Professor Barrett may have had about the ACA, said Professor Grewal, don't translate very well to the current case.  So that may be the case.  And it's important to mention this, In the case, in the instance that it is not struck down during this challenge.  So I just want to make sure that's clear.  At the same time, Amy Coney Barrett would heavily put the Supreme Court in favor of conservatives.  And of course, Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett signed a newspaper ad in 2006 calling for end to the barbaric legacy of Roe v. Wade.  So she would rip away a woman's right to choose.  There you go.  And of course, all the other, I mean, the decades-long impact that this would have on American citizens cannot really be translated properly because there's going to be case after case after case that Amy Coney Barrett is going to side with conservative justices on.  Now, let's get to the last clip here where Mitch McConnell just laughs over his failure on COVID-19. ",
