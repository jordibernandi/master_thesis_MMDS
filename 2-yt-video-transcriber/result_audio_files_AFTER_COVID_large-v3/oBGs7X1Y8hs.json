            "text": "So Jill Biden sat down with Jake Tapper.  You knew this was going to be good, right?  She sat down on CNN State of the Union over the weekend.  And of course, of course, as she should, Jill defended her husband and attacked the president and did what you would expect any former second lady and possible potential future first lady to do for her husband, who is an absolute train wreck.  And no one knows it better than Jill Biden does.  Unless she's got the wool pulled over her eyes.  But, I mean, come on.  If you've taken care of someone with an ailment before, young, middle-aged, or old, certainly people on the older end of the spectrum, you know it's difficult.  And you can see all this stuff, and it wears on you, too.  So, you know... To me, she's one of the ones who's most to blame for having Joe out there.  He should not be there.  He's not mentally fit to be there.  He is a gaffe machine.  He is a problem.  And he's someone who over 47 years has literally done nothing to help this country.  He's benefited a great deal.  47 years, all sorts of kickbacks, jobs, side hustles, this, that, and the other.  And then obviously his payment or his salary from all of the different roles he's had.  But But she knows better because she's with him all the time and still parades him around there trying to convince the world that he's okay when it's just clear that he's not.  But Jake Tapper fairly asked about his gaffes and how he frequently makes them.  She shut him down.  And he didn't push back, of course, because the CNN, this was the clip rule, too. ",

I think most of America sees it the other way.  Again, you're loyal, you're biased to your husband, you should be.  You should love your husband to death.  But there is a huge difference between the two candidates.  One who has taken our country to new levels in so many areas, done so many positive things in only three and a half, three and a half plus years of political service.  Your husband, again, who is a disaster in terms of his mental state and what he says and does right now.  And I don't know how you've stuck with him.  I applaud you for doing so because I'm not for the other.  But how you can sit there and think that he is more capable than President Trump when he's had 47 years and he's done nothing, and you've seen what this man has done, and you know that your party is lying and saying he's causing chaos, he's causing this, that, and the other, when it's literally the opposite is true.  But it was this same weekend that she's shutting down gaffes, and I love, too, how Jake Tapper said the occasional gaffe.  They're not occasional.  They're so free.  It's occasional gaffes.  that he says something normal and is clear and articulate.  But that's what happens on occasion.  The gaffes are, I mean, he's really good at it.  Like again, if you're gonna do something, do it well.  He does it really well.  He makes all sorts of mistakes.  He doesn't just sniff one person.  He's an equal sniffer.  He sniffs everyone.  He gropes everyone.  Again, if you're gonna do something, do it well.  Joe Biden, really good at gaffes.  Really good at making women and children feel uncomfortable.  That's just my two thoughts.  But on the same weekend that she is saying gaffes are off limits, Biden had guess what?  Yet another gaffe.  Roll three. ",

Because some of these gaffes are bad enough that it's like, okay, let's put this in there and see if he says it.  But 180 years, bro.  Again, you seem like you and Pelosi and Schumer and Feinstein and Maxine Waters.  Some of y'all, Maxine, you guys do seem like you're 180 years old, but you're not actually.  I want you to be clear about that and understand that.  If you're somewhere, just nod that you get what I'm saying.  But But yet another gaffe.  And even if the prompter accidentally said that, that should be something you can be like, oh, it says that, but I need to say I've actually been in service for 47 years.  Nearly a half a century, whatever you want to say.  Something that's accurate.  When you're talking about yourself, if you're talking about a policy, this, that, and the other, something that you don't understand perfectly, I get it.  Maybe you should know if you're running for president, but maybe you make a mistake there.  You kind of dance and tiptoe into some areas that you shouldn't and you say something stupid.  But when it comes to your background and who you are, it doesn't matter what the prompter says.  You should know that.  You should know that because it's you.  What? ",
