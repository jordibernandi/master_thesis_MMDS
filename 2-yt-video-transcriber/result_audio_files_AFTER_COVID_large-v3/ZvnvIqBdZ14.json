            "text": "but Yahweh warned them if they did not fully drive out all the Canaanites that they would be pricks in our eyes and thorns in our sides.  and that is exactly what happened.  the Canaanites gradually corrupted them blinded them to the truth and turned our ancestors away from Yahweh, leading them into all types of sin.  But after the Assyrian deportations and with the Israelite migrations into Europe, our people were separated from these accursed Canaanites.  And upon receiving Christ's gospel, once again we were able to keep the laws and commandments.  Does European Christian civilizations we built not show this?  Does it not show that we are the Israelites of the Bible?  the people of God.  Throughout all of our nations you will always have found law and order in every white European society.  No matter where you go, pick any country and you will find it.  It has been this way for centuries and it wasn't too long ago that for Europeans every man, woman and child would have known the Ten Commandments by heart.  Bibles were taught in our homes, churches, and even in our schools.  We read and knew our Bibles to a greater or lesser degree.  The average person feared God and knew that His laws should be upheld.  It is only with the infiltration of our governments and nations once again, only with a foreign force have our societies been corrupted and begun to be taken over and forced us to depart from the law and order-based system that our forefathers had established.  It's the exact same story as our ancestors in the lands of Canaan all over again.  They were slowly corrupted and so have we been over the past century.  Is it not obvious?  How can people not see it?  Now as for the laws, it should be noted that they were only ever given to one people, the children of Israel.  No other people in existence were ever given the law and therefore are not expected to keep it.  David in one of his Psalms said that he was glad that the laws were not given to any other nations and he praised Yahweh our God for it.  Now as for the laws, most people only think that there are only 10 commandments and that's it.  But there are actually many more laws.  When Moses and the children of Israel journeyed in the wilderness, Other laws were given to them, and these included prohibitions against usury, sorcery , sodomy, bestiality, the food laws, and many more.  But most importantly, the children of Israel were commanded to be a separate people, to not mingle with non-Adamites, especially the Canaanites.  All of these moral laws are our creator's blueprints instructing us how to build a moral functioning thriving civilization.  They are a loving father's directions to his children.  You only have to look at any European nation to see the truth.  and fulfillment of all of this.  Yahweh's commandments teach us what virtue is and they train us how to live properly.  In addition if we properly maintain these laws and truly abide them it protects our societies from infiltration.  Now some people believe that the laws are only temporary and that once Christ came they don't matter anymore.  And that is simply not true.  These moral laws are forever.  They never expired.  Only the Levitical rituals were retired once Christ came, or as Paul calls them, the works of the law.  Since Christ was the last sacrifice, they were not needed.  So since the moral laws did not pass away, every generation of Israelites is required to follow them to this day.  So all Europeans, being their descendants, are still expected to keep the laws.  They are your heritage.  Christ himself told his followers, if you love me, then you will keep my commandments.  Which commandments would those be?  He was referring to the same ten commandments and other laws that he gave to us.  He being Yahweh our God, he gave them to Moses and then to our ancestors.  And Christ is God, and therefore those old commandments are his commandments.  Furthermore, Christ gave us a new commandment, so He takes it even further, and that is that we should love one another as He loved us, and that way everyone will know that we are His disciples.  Now no man can just turn up and make his own new additions to Yahweh's laws.  Only God Himself can do that.  Since Christ is God, He can do it.  If a new commandment is made to complement the old ones, we are still expected to keep all the old commandments as well.  In Christ's name, we are commanded to truly love and care for one another, that is, to care for other Israelites as true children of Yahweh.  We are a brother's keeper.  So which people have followed Christ's commandments, which are our God's commandments?  Who built entire civilizations based on his laws?  Who opposed what the Bible prohibits going to great lengths to ban usury, sexual deviancy, pornography, drugs use, i.e.  sorcery, gambling, and all other vices that tempt people and destroy their lives and our civilizations?  These were all outlawed before Europe became secular during very recent times.  One renowned jurist and member of parliament, William Blackstone, wrote in his commentaries on the laws of England, the attitude of the European Christian man and woman towards law and order.  The Bible has always been regarded as part of the common law of England, and no enactment of man can be considered law unless it confirms to the law of God.  Blackstone's writing also had a tremendous influence on the Americans' founding fathers.  The American Constitution they drafted is based on the Bible laws, as well as older documents such as the Magma Carta, the Scottish Declaration of Arbroath, and many more.  Yahweh said that He, speaking to the Israelites at the time of the deportations, that He would write the laws upon their hearts.  So if we could find these people who have obeyed the law, built civilizations on the law, then those people must be the children of Israel.  Are the laws of God not written upon the hearts of Europeans?  Our societies are based on the Bible because we are the people of the Bible. ",
