And Ravi makes the statement, he says, the truth is the most important thing in the entire world.  I guess it's time I take a look at Ravi Zacharias.  Welcome to Polygia, where a former Christian takes a look at the claims of Christians.  If you're new to the channel, please take a second to tap on the subscribe button, so that you'll be notified when new science, theology, and news videos come out.  When I was an evangelical Christian, I was vaguely aware of Ravi Zacharias, but he wasn't someone who influenced my thoughts or those around me.  Rightly or wrongly, I thought of him more as a soft, heartstring, storyteller, stadium preacher.  more akin to Billy Graham than to apologists like William Lane Craig or C.S.  Lewis.  In fact, if you scroll through my videos and see which apologists and creationists I address, they are the people who are influencing the Christians I know and love in real life.  The guest speakers who've shown up in my church.  The authors of the books on the nightstands of my family.  The authorities quoted when debating theology.  I'm sorry if your favorite Christian thinker isn't included.  They may well be brilliant, but they're not presently influencing those who I hope to influence.  Around the time I left my Christian faith, I became generally aware that Ravi Zacharias was making waves more for some personal and professional controversies.  some of these are documented at a website called raviwatch dot com.  if you are interested in assorted details though they are irrelevant to the topic at hand today i mention this only to say that i made the mistake of assuming that ravi would become less influential in the coming years.  why was i wrong?  Sadly, Ravi passed away earlier this year, and I was somewhat taken aback by the outpouring of praise and admiration for him from the apologists that I do cover regularly.  If Ravi remains such an influencer of today's influencers, maybe it's time I take a look.  And what better place to start than his most popular YouTube video, watched over 4 million times.  If all religions claim to be truth... then how can Christianity make that claim and think that it is correct? ",

Because these religions build on other religions, those with more layers are necessarily less probable.  We start with Judaism, which has its base in the Old Testament.  I realize this is a Christian-centric label for the Torah, the Law, and the Prophets.  and that each Abrahamic faith disagrees on what text should constitute that foundation, but let's simplify for now to mean the portions of Judaism that get borrowed by other faiths.  Then we have Christianity, which layers on the claims of the New Testament.  Christianity's truth requires both the Old and New Testaments be true, so more points of failure than Judaism.  Then we have Islam, which affirms much of the Old and New Testaments, and adds the Quran on top of that.  So now there are three layers, each with its own points of failure.  The Book of Mormon also relies on the Old and New Testaments, so also has three points of failure, and so on. ",

Ravi is advocating that we grade a religion on how well their answers work in harmony, or at least fail to create new plot holes, as it were.  I'm sure Ravi would acknowledge that countless conspiracy theories, or works of fiction, can maintain impressive internal consistency when they try.

What you are failing to consider is that perhaps no religion is correct.  In fact, what do your key questions look like if no religion is correct?  Origin.  Well, some sort of energy singularity expanded into our current instantiation of spacetime.  Eventually, atoms clustered into stars, planets, and life.  Meaning.  Because each of us has only one life, we generally treat it as precious and want to use it well.  That's meaning.  Morality.  As a social species, our survival advantages lie in working together.  And working together is more efficient when we can empathize with others.  When we treat others as we would want to be treated, things are better for all.  There's more prospering, less suffering, and better survival.  and these empathetic traits get passed on more.  Destiny.  We all have one life that will one day end.  The limited supply encourages, among most, the value, the meaning, the morality we spoke of.  There we go.  These answers correspond precisely with reality and are entirely internally consistent.  No religion required.  Of course, my quality answers don't necessarily negate other possible answers.  If only Ravi understood this.  Thank you so much for watching.  I recently covered a similar video from William Lane Craig, who argued that a world without God isn't one that he would enjoy.  Is that an argument though?
