            "text": "It was one of the big churches.  Okay.  And I didn't feel like that was for me.  Yeah.  Well, there's definitely a lot of yelling in Hebrew, Israelite culture as well.  I just want to share with you just one thing.  I know you don't really know us.  You came out here, and we're trying to encourage you.  And I just want you to hear one thing.  My name is, again, Jeff.  And whatever you heard about Christ and the gospel before, even what you've heard from the Hebrew Israelites, the Bible has a really, really clear, consistent message about who Jesus is and what it means to have peace with God.  And ultimately, listen, here's the thing.  If you came here today and you were even here for an abortion, it would be the same thing we want you to know.  And that is the love of God.  and the forgiveness and salvation and the peace with God that's available in Jesus.  So I just want to give you the message, and that's that Jesus is God in the flesh.  It was promised that God was coming as a man to take upon himself the sins of his people.  Now, you've probably heard that before.  Jesus died for sinners and rose again from the dead.  But he came specifically to live a perfect life, to die the death that you and I both deserve.  And he rose again from the dead.  The call of the gospel is very different in Scripture from what is commonly heard today in America in terms of like a Jesus movement.  You know, there's this really nice guy named Jesus, kind of a cool hippie white guy, sometimes in some cultures, you know, might teach that sort of a thing.  And Hebrew Israelites a lot of times think the Christian culture might teach that sort of a thing.  But the message of Jesus is not that he wants to just be your friend or be sort of an accessory to your life.  The message of Jesus is that we're all sinners.  and that we all deserve hell.  There's none of us who are righteous before God.  We're not good.  We'll never be good enough because God is too holy, and all of our sins separate us from Him.  And the message of Jesus is that life, forgiveness, and peace is only through faith in Him, through turning to Him and trusting in Him.  The common thing you might hear today in maybe some churches is that You know, here's what Jesus did.  And if you just believe mentally that he did those things, then you're good to go.  But the call of Jesus was actually to turn from sin, to trust in him, and to trust in him as Savior from your sin, and to be your Lord, your God.  The message of Jesus was calling to him to life, coming to him for life and forgiveness and peace.  All of us on this street right now, we're not good.  We're not better than you.  We're not better than anybody.  We're saved, redeemed people.  And it was a gift of God through faith in Jesus.  So I just want to encourage you to hear that message.  You can have peace with God today.  The call is to turn from sin, to trust in Jesus as Savior and as Lord.  And you can have peace with God, forgiveness for all eternity, eternal life.  That's the gift.  That's the gift.  And I wanted to say, I have a heart for you.  You mentioned Hebrew-Israelite.  I want to encourage you to know that that particular cult really started in the last century.  And a lot of really wonderful people in it.  I've met some guys that are deeply connected to that movement, really great guys.  But I want to warn you, the message that they have about Jesus is very different from Scripture, the way that Jesus says that He is.  And it's very different in terms of how you can know God and be forgiven.  The message of Jesus is much better than you think it is.  It's much more amazing.  There's more peace.  There's more life.  There's more beauty than anything else can offer you.  Sex outside of marriage.  Hebrew-Israelite.  Doesn't matter what it is.  Jesus is enough.  And we want you to know him. ",

So I'll just keep that up for you.  There's a couple of them.  So it's like hours.  And the most important thing is this.  There are so many people.  Thank you for letting me do that.  There's so many people that claim to believe in Jesus to say, you know, I know this is who Jesus is.  This is how you know him.  But the real question is, what does God say in his word?  Right?  Can I just give you a parallel real fast?  And I know you're probably hot.  I'll let you on your way.  Mormons teach, they say, I believe in Jesus.  But what they teach about Jesus is that he's Satan's brother and that he's one God among many gods.  And the ultimate goal is to become a God of your own planet one day and have endless celestial sex.  It's not the message of the Bible, right?  It's the figment of Joseph Smith, the founder of Mormonism's imagination, right?  Jesus was clear about who he is and clear about how we can know him.  And with Hebrew Israelites, it's the same kind of situation as like a Joseph Smith or a Charles Taze Russell with the Jehovah's Witnesses.  It's people that came up and they said, no, no, I'm going to tell you who Jesus is.  It's not what this says.  It's my portrait of Jesus.  It's my way to Jesus.  And the Bible warns us about things like that.  false Christ, false ways of salvation.  Jesus is God in the flesh.  He is the way to forgiveness and peace with God.  That gift of peace is a gift.  You can't earn it.  It's through turning to Him in faith and receiving Him as Savior and Lord.  Not just knowing things about Jesus.  I have a lot of family that's sort of like... in part of that Christian culture that sort of says, oh, I'm Christian, why?  Because, well, I've been to church my whole life.  I know the story of Jesus kind of a thing.  But they don't know Jesus.  They've never turned to him to be saved.  And that's what we want for you, Chai.  Beautiful name.  There's just a track with some information on it.  My name is Jeff, by the way.  And I'd love to talk to you more.  You can get connected to us even through that video that I gave to you.  as well.
