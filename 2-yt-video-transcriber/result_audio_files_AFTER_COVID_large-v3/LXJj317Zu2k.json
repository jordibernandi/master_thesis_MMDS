I just think in many respects, we're seeing what's amounting to nothing short of a very real fall, a fall from grace, as it were, from one of America's, well, without question, most significant and celebrated celebrities, Oprah Winfrey.  Now, I'm talking about not just specifically about one of the biggest controversies that's gripped our nation of late and her involvement in that.  But this is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of the controversies that she's been involved with for the past several years.  So let's just start with her latest endorsement of a very controversial book for her highly successful book club.  The book is called Cast, C-A-S-T-E.  And what the author reportedly argues is that the United States is systematically akin to oppressive political and economic systems that we find, for example, in the United States.  in India's traditional caste system.  So in this sense, then the United States appropriates race and defines race in relation to a social hierarchy with whites on the top and African-Americans confined to the bottom deliberately of this hierarchy.  And the book goes on to make comparisons to the American social order, not simply to the caste system of India, but also to Nazi Germany.  And Oprah is pushing this.  Not only does she claim that it was one of the most important books she's ever read, but she's actually calling on literally all of humanity to read this book as well.  Now, this isn't the first time that Oprah got into a bit of a pickle with regard to rather strange picks for her book club.  You may remember the so-called American Dirt controversy.  It was an interesting controversy, analytically speaking, that is, that Oprah got herself into.  She pushed big time a book entitled American Dirt.  It was a fictional account of a Mexican migrant who went into the United States illegally.  She's being chased by drug cartels and the like.  But the controversy surrounded the fact that the book was written by a so-called European-born woman living in the United States who had no ties whatsoever to the Mexican migrant experience.  And a lot of critics were angered by what they considered this author's use of offensive Latino stereotypes, right?  You live by PC, you die by PC, I guess.  And so Oprah was forced to backtrack on the book.  And in effect, she had to admit that she was totally blind to these racial stereotypes herself.  But the damage was already done, and she was widely accused of having helped perpetuate what liberal critics saw as a blatant and obvious example of of opportunistic cultural appropriation on the part of this author.  And yet, Oprah has no problem lecturing the rest of us on our supposed insensitivity towards racial stereotypes and our unconscious or deliberate biases or whatever.  And this is all coming on the heels of a very clear pivot of late for Oprah.  who's appearing very much inclined to embracing the new wokeness, the new racial narrative that has pervaded our national discourse since the death of George Floyd.  So shortly after the riots broke out, Oprah hosted an episode on her Apple TV Plus series, where she pushed relentlessly this notion of white privilege.  And when guests came on pointing out the rather inconvenient fact that not all white people have power.  There are plenty of white people who are underprivileged, right?  Living in adverse conditions.  Hardly the paragon of white privilege when you're underprivileged.  Even though that was pointed out to Oprah, she nevertheless responded saying that, and I'm quoting her, There are white people who are not as powerful as the system of white people.  Here's that term, the caste system that's been put in place.  But they still, no matter where they are on the rung or the ladder of success, they still have their whiteness.  You still have your whiteness.  That's what the term white privilege is.  It means that whiteness still gives you an advantage no matter, close quote.  Now, obviously, she was mercilessly brutalized for that comment.  Here we have a woman that's worth over $2 billion.  And not only does she have the goal of lecturing the rest of us on privilege, or white privilege for that matter, she has the goal of the lectures about poor people benefiting from white privilege, the underprivileged.  benefiting from privilege, right?  She doesn't seem to give a rip about their poverty stricken lives.  She's been so blinded to their sufferings and adversities by this racial stereotype.  And then of course, not to be outdone, Oprah's gotten deeply involved in the very controversial 1619 project.  It's a so-called history project that doesn't, as it turns out, have any historians involved with it.  It's being pushed by the so-called journalists at the New York Times.  So it's a journalistic project.  It's based on the premise that American history actually began in 1619, which aside is the date that slaves first made it to North America.  By the way, that date is wrong.  A number of historians have pointed out that slaves arrived in North America in the 1500s.  But Then again, this is a propaganda project.  It's not intended for historical accuracy.  And so what the 1619 Project does is it interprets everything following this.  All the historical events studied in American history are studied through the lens of slavery.  So it's a highly Marxist conception of history.  that develops in terms of the clash between oppressor and oppressed.  But as it turns out, this is just the tip of the iceberg of Oprah Winfrey and her history of scandals.  But before we get into that, we've got something for you podcast fans out there.

All right, now let's get into Oprah's history of scandal, shall we?  When there was all this buzz over whether she would run for president, do you remember?  And have you noticed that buzz has completely died down of late?  Isn't that interesting?  Well, one of the reasons for that is that the editors over at the Washington Post wrote articles basically saying, careful what you wish for.  And they thought there was just simply too much baggage in Oprah's history that would come back to haunt her if she were to run for president.  Do you remember her $40 million gift to poor South African girls in what was called the Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls?  It opened in 2007.  It was replete with a yoga studio, beauty salon, all that.  In literally just a matter of months after opening, the dorm matron was arrested and accused of sexually abusing at least half a dozen seventh and eighth graders.  Now, of course, Oprah threw her under the bus, right?  She threw the dorm matron under the bus.  She accused the school administration of covering up the issue.  She had absolutely nothing to do with it.  It was all her fault.  She would seek full justice and all that.  But then a couple of years later, Several girls were expelled after accusations were made that they tried to have sexual relationship with their fellow students.  And then the original charges against that dorm matron began to unravel.  And she was acquitted by a jury because the girls testimonies were totally self contradictory and not credible.  And then the dorm matron turned around and sued Oprah Winfrey for defamation, which forced Oprah to settle out of court.  Which, of course, cost her, I'm sure, a very large sum of money.  But if that weren't bad enough, you actually have Oprah mixed up with the whole Harvey Weinstein scandal.  At the height of the hashtag MeToo movement, of which Oprah has anointed herself as a major champion and advocate.  critics actually started pushing back against her by revealing this bizarre relationship she had with Weinstein.  Now, we have to understand that according to multiple reports, everyone who was anyone in Hollywood knew about Harvey Weinstein and what he was doing to women, okay?  Everybody knew.  And yet it was tolerated.  It was hush-hushed.  One of the major personalities that tolerated Weinstein appears to have been Oprah Winfrey.  And this is becoming increasingly acknowledged by celebrities.  So, for example, the rap star Snoop Dogg recently slammed Oprah on a scathing Instagram post for widely circulated photos of her smiling and laughing with Weinstein years before his now infamous sexual assault allegations were made public.  A number of outlets like Variety magazine have reported on celebrities actually testifying that they know that Oprah knew about Weinstein's predatory behavior towards young women, and yet she, in effect, covered it up.  There's actually a petition out there online for Oprah to publicly disavow Weinstein, especially in light of the speech she gave at the Golden Globes, which celebrated female empowerment.  That's when everybody was like, Oprah needs to run for president and all that.  But a number of others were like, no, this just proves what kind of hypocrite she is.  And that's when you began to see all these photos of Oprah with Weinstein.  The most infamous one is, of course, her kissing his ear at some gala or event.  Moreover, you also had one of Bill Clinton's alleged sexual abuse victims, right?  Juanita Broderick.  She came out and accused Oprah of blatant hypocrisy after a Golden Globe speech, since Oprah did everything she could not only to rehabilitate Bill's image on her television show in the 2000s, but Oprah, of course, went on to endorse Hillary Clinton in 2016.  So there are many, many critics who see Winfrey as a hypocritical spokesperson for the Me Too movement to, well, to put that mildly.  But circling back to her controversies over race, I don't know if you remember an interview that she gave to the BBC a few years back where she made the now infamous comment that old racists have to die.  She was promoting one of her films when she was asked about race and racism by the interviewer.  And she said this, quote, And while such comments were certainly celebrated by many on the left, such as at Jezebel.com, a champion Oprah for joining what they call the long line of people waiting for old racists to die.  As the Washington Post points out, many on the right accused her of pushing cheap identity politics for no other reason than to just promote her movie that was coming out.  So whatever may have been said about Oprah Winfrey in the past in terms of what a positive force she's been for so many, it really does appear increasingly clear that not only has that past been significantly checkered with very severe controversies, but her present pivot towards racial politics is promising an ever more controversial future.
