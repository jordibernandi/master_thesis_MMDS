We are brought to you by Amazon Prime Videos, timely new documentary, All In, The Fight for Democracy, produced by and featuring the one and only Stacey Abrams.  All In offers an insider's look into how voter suppression and barriers have attempted to corrupt our democracy from the very beginning, and how activists throughout history, and especially right here and now, are fighting for everyone's right to vote.  All in, the Pfeiffer Democracy is streaming on Amazon Prime Video starting September 18th.  The link is in the description, which the experts tell me is right below this video or something.  Welcome to another episode of Campaign Experts React, where we break down 2020 election ads and political media, explain what the people behind them are trying to accomplish, and decide whether or not they did a good job.  I'm Dan Pfeiffer, former communications director for Barack Obama.  Joining me today is Alex Wagner, co-host and executive producer of The Circus on Showtime.  Alex, thank you for joining our ridiculously named show, Campaign Experts React.  I would note you are recording in Pennsylvania where you are on the road for the circus.  I am recording from your apocalyptic climate change future.  in the bay area where it is still dusk and the sun is red at 11 30 because there is smoke trapped a thousand feet above the air by 50 mile an hour winds.

That's why Maine is done with her weakness and excuses.  Collins isn't an independent.  She's a fraud.  Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump control her voice.  She makes excuses for corruption, for criminality, for cruelty, all while pretending she's worried, concerned, hoping Donald Trump learns a lesson this time.  He never does because she never stands up, never speaks out, never does what a Maine leader should do.  Susan Collins doesn't work for Maine.  She works for them.

The Margaret Chase Smith piece in the beginning is like directed specifically towards Susan Collins.  She name checks Margaret J. Smith as her idol all the time.  So this seems like personally directed at Susan Collins as far as it's saying, hey, lady, you ain't no Margaret J. Smith.  Beyond that, there's no specific sound of her, you know, announcing her vote for Brett Kavanaugh.  There's no specific sound if we're talking about how she's going to protect a woman's right to choose when Kavanaugh seems intent on dismantling that.  There's no mention of her vote for the GOP tax bill, which, of course, unwound the individual mandate, which was part of Obamacare.  Susan Collins has for years told the country that she is unpredictable in her voting style.  At the end of the day, I think in 2017, she voted with Trump 87% of the time.  So I feel like it could be a lot more hard hitting than it actually is. ",

When you are taking on an incumbent, particularly one who has won races by large margins in the past, you have to convince some number of people who have spent their lives voting for this person to do something different.  And in order to do that, you can't make them feel bad about their vote.  We either have to say the context has changed or the person has changed.  Susan Collins got 69% of the vote in 2014 in Maine.  So, you know, as many as a fifth of Sarah Gideon's voters might be previous Susan Collins voters.  And so yelling at them for being wrong seems like an approach that, at least in my experience, is not particularly effective.  I am curious, since we're on The Lincoln Project, you're out there Talking to a lot of people on both sides of the aisle.

And they're more than anything, almost universally, just disgusted at the way the country's going right now.  And they haven't figured out And it is shocking, but they haven't figured out who they think is better prepared to get the country out of this morass.  I feel like the Lincoln Project is like the sort of id of every frustrated, you know, progressive and progressive leading journalist, which is just like bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.  And, you know, the bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad is presented in a very social media friendly way.

And so this purely evocative, emotional approach may be more effective to elect a Republican in Florida than it would be to win Florida for Joe Biden.

And I think that, you know, the makers of that ad understand the resonance of those words and those images.  You know, those images, even when you don't have a really damning Atlantic article pull quote over them, those images are a reminder of sort of like how America gets to be America and the sort of moral, ethical, human cost of keeping the country safe.

It's just words.  So many times overly cinematically ambitious ad makers will put a little too much spin on the ball in the hope to win whatever the equivalent of an Oscar is for a political ad.  So this is just very straightforward.  This is, in my mind, exactly what a very smart, sophisticated advertising operation is, which is you take a piece of content that exists and you pay to put it in front of voters who would not otherwise see it.  And they turned it around in, I think, about 12 hours and had it in front of people.  And I think it is incredibly effective.  And I agree with you that this is one of those things that can very much matter, but we have to show it to people for it to matter.  And that's what the Biden campaign is doing. ",

And I think that's for two reasons.  One is I think there's just a fundamental truth that people objectively like to combat racism, but they don't like to be told that they and their communities are racist, right?  The other piece of it is at the beginning of the summer, Trump was more aggressively going after the protesters, the tear gassing of protesters in Lafayette Park.  People could see the asymmetrical response.  and I think they were more standing in solidarity with people who were on the front lines demanding justice and equality.  Though the poll numbers for Black Lives Matter have gone down over the course of the summer, the support for Donald Trump's handling of racial unrest has not moved.  He had an opportunity.  There was like a three-week period where he could have stepped in and really used a law and order message, I think, to his advantage, but he has completely frittered that away on a tactical level to say nothing of the moral leadership of the United States.  And he has ceded whatever ground he could have stood on to extremists.  in this white supremacist vein.  Donald Trump is making his bed with Kyle Rittenhouse.  From a political ad making perspective, that ad scares me and gives me a headache at the same time.  And I think it could be effective if you had some kind of message you know, combating it or rebutting it from the right, from the Trump campaign that offered a kind of like restoration of order, but you're not getting any of that.  And then the least persuading part of the whole thing, nobody thinks Joe Biden is a 78-year-old Antifa supporter.  I mean, it's just that part of the Trump branding, I think, has failed. ",
