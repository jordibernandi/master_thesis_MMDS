            "text": "Hey guys, Bix Weir.  It is catch-up time at the Road to Ruta.  Here's where we are in the current repos as of today, which is March 18th.  Continuing the moonshot, obviously.  Interesting fact is that the FICC guarantees has gone down, went down in February.  Now March is when the chaos hits, so I'm sure it'll go way above December.  So I expect that to jump back up, but it did come down about $32 billion.  The Fed craps $32 billion these days, so it's not a big deal.  But we are up at $1 trillion.  $298 billion that the Fed has flooded the market with overnight repos, term repos, and permanent operations.  Permanent operations are in the $560 billion range.  There is no stopping.  This is the endgame.  The endgame is print as much of the U.S.  dollar as you wish, and that's what they're doing.  Like I said, Open fire hydrant, not a fire hose spraying money all over the place, but a fire hydrant is open.  And what do you do when you see this?  In a normal market, you'd say, oh, man, I'm going to short the dollar.  That's how I'm going to make money because they're printing too much of it.  I'm going to buy gold and silver.  That's how I'm going to make money because they print too much of it.  Don't do it.  Don't do it.  Why?  Because they rigged the prices with the computers invented by Alan Greenspan.  Here's what happened.  Here's what just happened to those people trying to short the dollar right here.  This is what a $12 trillion margin call looks like.  Look at that.  Mystery chart.  It's not a mystery.  That's the chart of the US dollar.  That is unheard of.  Look at that.  No, it's not Volkswagen or Tesla.  It's the world's reserve currency soaring to an all-time high.  Why?  Because they're doing this.  They are printing like it's going out of style.  And the riggers don't want, Steve Mnuchin and friends do not want people trying to fight the government.  So they take their mouse and they click it.  I can destroy $12 trillion with the click of a mouse.  And that's what they did too.  All the shorts are now dead in the water.  It'll be interesting who their counterparties are.  How many of them were Deutsche Bank counterparties?  We'll find out.  The bloodletting continues.  It is just out of control right now.  Dollars at all-time highs.  This is what happens when a global margin call reveals there is a $12 trillion short squeeze.  Who in their right mind would go short?  If you're going to buy gold, you buy the physical and you stick it in your pocket and walk away from all markets.  That's the only way to survive when all this falls apart.  This is a great sign.  That means all the shorts on the dollar are now dead and they can allow the dollar to fall now.  So we should see gold, silver, cryptos start being allowed to move up slowly in the near future.  This is the endgame, 100% endgame.  Everybody's saying, no, Bix, they're going to bail out the banks.  They're kind of bailing out the banks now, but the banks need more and the companies need more.  Now, the Fed can't bail out the companies.  They got to go to Congress for that.  And Congress is going to say no.  I guarantee you they're going to say no.  Or they're going to say, we'll only bail you out if you give all your profits to the people.  After blowing a... After blowing $4.5 trillion on share buybacks, airlines, Boeing, and other culprits want taxpayer and Fed bailouts of their shareholders.  Chapter 11 bankruptcy that wipes out shareholders is the correct solution for collapsing share buyback queens.  U.S.  airlines already know this from experience.  It works.  The Trump administration is putting together a rumor $850 billion to give to people.  Now, do you remember when Boeing and American Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines gave you a share of their profits if you're not a shareholder?  You remember that?  No, I don't remember that either.  As a matter of fact, with their huge money, what did they do with it?  They did share buybacks so they could get the money.  So their share value can go up and all the options were in the money for Boeing and American Airlines, United Airlines.  But when it goes the other way, they expect you to bail them out.  That's bullshit.  I say don't do it.  I don't think Congress is going to do it.  Or they're going to put \u2013 Elizabeth Warren will put so many stipulations on that \u2013 The banks will say, hey, we're better off just going belly up and then there'll be a big fight.  But that's the end game.  How many bankster slash corporate bailouts are there?  I mean, if you're going to bail out the airlines, you got to bail out the cruise liners.  You're going to bail out them, you got to bail out the entire travel industry.  If you're going to bail out them, you got to bail out the bars and restaurants.  You're going to bail out them, you got to bail out blah, blah, blah.  It goes on.  You got to bail out everybody.  This ain't going to work.  And remember this, and this is the biggest thing that you have to remember.  Besides the coronavirus destruction that is going to be caused to human life and the health of the humans sitting here on this little blue rock, is the fact that China doesn't like America and America doesn't like China.  They're blaming each other, both sides blaming each other for the coronavirus.  What will that do?  It assures there will be no more trade between China and America.  No more trade, as in nothing is getting made.  Right here is the last iPhone I'll ever own.  Probably for five years until the U.S.  ramps up production on iPhones.  But it still won't work.  It won't be the same iPhone because you don't have all the pieces and parts that are sourced from around the world.  This is what I've been warning of.  This is what Greenspan wrote in his Financial Times article about the reversal of globalization is devastating.  Devastating.  Nobody knew how it was going to happen.  Well, maybe some people.  I didn't know they'd unleash this bioweapon on humanity and everybody would shut their borders.  So it happened.  And that's where we stand.  Who can survive something like this as far as economically?  No.  None of them.  Why?  Because all the banks are gone.  Every single bank on planet Earth is done as of the day this virus went off.  I heard late November now, but definitely early December.  When that was triggered and it started to spread, that was it for the global financial system.  Why?  Because bankers are leveraged massively.  Massive derivatives held in China.  This $12 trillion short crushing, short squeeze, probably $100 trillion in derivatives were triggered.  Nobody can handle that.  And banks in general, no one's going to be paying their bills.  Like nobody.  Even if Steve Mnuchin and Donald Trump printed and Jerome Powell printed trillion dollars for every single person on planet Earth, it still wouldn't work.  It wouldn't put anything on the shelves.  The game is over.  Now it gets to.  how long do we want to drag this bullshit out?  How long is Steve Mnuchin and Trump going to drag this out?  How is the U.S.  Congress going to bail out the banks so we last another month?  Are they going to bail out Boeing and United Airlines and all the restaurants of the world?  And all the employees of the restaurants and all the employees of the airlines and all the banks that lent to them.  How about oil and gas?  All the banks that are knee deep in oil and gas are bleeding red right now.  Remember, they're levered 10 to 1.  It's great when it goes up.  They make 10 times the money.  When it comes down, everybody's selling the same assets.  They lose 10 times the money.  Poof, they're gone.  They are done.  It's over.  So you see this fight between China and the  U.S.?  You think it's a big deal?  Yeah, I get that people are saying, no, no, no, this is all conspiracy theory.  This is Q. This is the way Q is going to fight them off.  Q is arresting people right now.  And that's fine.  That's great.  And I do believe there will be a lot of arrests only because the electronic monetary system that we lived off for the past 60, 70 years is dead.  So of course they're going to arrest the criminals.  But it doesn't fix anything.  It doesn't start production up again.  This isn't going to be three weeks.  It's going to be three years.  You watch what happens after three weeks.  Right now in California, they're saying, oh, we got a three-week lockdown.  You watch what happens.  Three weeks will go by and it'll be worse.  Much worse.  Road to Ruta's Solution was to pull the band-aid fast.  Tell the truth to humanity.  Destroy the old system and instantly implement a new system.  How do you allocate money to the new system?  Because all the money will be gone.  Remember that.  Your 401k, stock market, bond market, all that.  It's all ridiculous anyway.  They lied to you.  People who are really going to get hurt is people with no debt.  You played the game, they said how you should play it, and now you're the one getting screwed.  Everybody with debt, that debt goes away.  Yahoo!  Everyone with electronic assets, that debt goes away.  That asset goes away if it's third party.  Now why will Bitcoin still be there?  Absolutely Bitcoin will still be there.  Why?  Because it's on the blockchain.  The blockchain's not going anywhere.  If they shut down the internet, then we're all dead anyway.  You can't get the goods at all.  No goods will be... That's the number one key thing now is for survival of humanity to keep the Internet up and running, keep it as free as possible.  In China, they cannot have a free Internet because they would accidentally let it out the bag.  That, oh, by the way, a billion people have the coronavirus and 100 million have died.  That's what they're hiding from everyone.  Whoever did this, whether it was China or the U.S.  or Bill Gates or whoever did it, that has to come out and those people have to be skewered.  And the bad guys who are trying to take control, the guys Dick Allgaier is talking about, they got to come out of the shadows too.  Soros and all the criminals behind him and the criminals behind that and the Pope and the criminals behind that and the Queen of England and the criminals behind that.  All of it needs to come out in the open, and we need to fight for our country.  This is the endgame, my friends.  So, yeah.  Do I think gold and silver and cryptos will go moonshot?  Not while these exchanges are open.  But they're not going to be open for very long.  Right now, you can't get any silver.  And the price is still going down.  It's going down, down, down.  Where's the regulator?  Who's the regulator?  It's ridiculous.  It's redonkulous.  Anyway, if you want more information, go to roadtorear.com.  Go to the very first thing there, the parts one, two, and three, interviews with Cliff High.  Part one, he was talking about year zero in September before this corona thing even came.  He's been talking about the sun disease since the 1990s, and it's playing out exactly how he said it would 20 years ago, over 20.  And then watch part two and watch part three.  Hopefully I get part four at some point.  Because I do think at the end of this, when it's all over, say five years down the line, and we kick out the bad guys and we take over our own monetary system and the people in charge of their own money, and we kick out the government.  after all the shit's gone and the virus has gone away and however many people survive at all, what a bunch of great lessons we learned to move forward.  And no, I would not, do not give up your free will to anybody saying, hey, I'm the government.  We're here to help.  We want to track you now on your phone to see if you're hanging out with more than 10 people.  It's for the coronavirus.  Fight that with all your might.  We have to fight for our freedoms with all our might.  We might not win, but we're going to go down fighting.  This is Bix.  Talk to you later. ",
