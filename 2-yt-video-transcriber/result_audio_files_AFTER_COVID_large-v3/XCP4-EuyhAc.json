            "text": "The president of the LDS Church, Russell M. Nelson, posted a video to the church's YouTube channel the other day encouraging members to hashtag give thanks for the things they're grateful for.  It was an 11 minute video where he talked about the healing power of gratitude and at the end he issued this challenge for members to spend the next seven days using the hashtag give thanks on social media talking about what they're grateful for.  And the second part of the challenge is also to pray to God and tell Him what you're grateful for, express gratitude.  So I'm a big fan of gratitude.  Those of you who watched my journaling video last week know that I am a big fan of gratitude journaling and I encourage people in that video to start a gratitude journal.  Like President Nelson said in his video, gratitude is really healing and powerful in positive ways in our lives.  There is a large body of research at this point and it's ever-growing, demonstrating the value of gratitude in terms of both mental health and physical health.  and our ability to be nicer to each other.  So when I first heard about this video, this campaign that the church was doing, my initial reaction is like, that's awesome.  I think for those of us who are ex-Mormon or who criticize the LDS church, we spend a lot of time thinking about the harmful things that they teach and the ways that that negatively impacts people's well-being and mental health.  So when something happens like this where the church is encouraging something like gratitude, which is just objectively a healthy habit, I feel good about that, you know, that kind of gives me a little bit of hope and it's nice to not feel so cynical all the time, you know, it's nice to recognize that.  you know.  as with everything nothing is good or bad.  most things are sort of a mix and we're all human and things are messy and things aren't always black and white.  so um contrary to what uh mine and Hannah's haters think I'm not um you know out to get the LDS church like if they do something good I'm down to acknowledge it I'm celebrating it and I love gratitude.  with that being said um Yeah, everything isn't black and white and I think that extends to this campaign as well.  So I just want to talk a little bit about the good the bad and the ugly of this campaign as I'm probably gonna title this video.  So I watched the 11 minute video this morning to just make sure I wasn't chatting shit in this video and some things I liked about it were Firstly, I mean the message of gratitude being healing.  I'm into that.  I felt like it was pretty heartfelt on the part of President Nelson.  I got the impression that the video was at least partly written by a PR team Which I don't necessarily have a problem with, but just an observation.  Maybe it wasn't, I don't know.  He was definitely trying to come across as very genuine and heartfelt.  Again, I'm not necessarily doubting that that is true.  But yeah, he talked about the death of his first wife and the death of his children, which just humanized him.  It kind of just showed that he understands these very human problems of loss and grief.  So I thought even just purely from a PR standpoint, that was like a good thing and just good to see someone's humanness, especially someone that people have elevated, you know, in a religious setting, like put on this pedestal.  The Mormons believe that he is a prophet of God.  So nice to see some humanity there.  He mentioned COVID and there was imagery of people putting on masks and he talked about how he was concerned about the pandemic and stuff, but also felt like it was a knockoff. ",
