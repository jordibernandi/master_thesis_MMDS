In a practice beginning last year, Chinese authorities demolished farmers' homes to create more profitable projects.  We hear from one such farmer who forcefully lost her home.  The FBI says investigations with CCP ties are way up since a decade ago.  Over 2,000 cases currently being investigated.  And the U.S.  and the European Union are in talks regarding the Chinese regime's threat to the West.  Mike Pompeo pointing out it's an issue between the CCP and the world.  Welcome to China.  In Focus, I'm Tiffany Meyer.  Unusual natural phenomena seem to appear more and more in China.  We recently reported on oddly shaped hailstones that rained down on Beijing.  Some say they resembled ice sculptures of the CCP virus.  Now we look at video of a tornado in northern China.  Some netizens on social media likened the storm to a scene from a science fiction film.  The clip was captured on Wednesday.  So far, no Chinese media have reported on it, so there's no information about possible casualties or other damages.  Now to Beijing.  Many people are trying to leave the Chinese capital.  A recent video shows a highway packed with cars on one side, but very few on the other.  The person who captured this video said he's traveling along the side that leads into Beijing.  The other side are cars trying to leave.  Official regulation requires that anyone who tries to leave Beijing must show a negative virus test result from the last seven days.  But due to long wait times for virus testing, in some cases up to three months, many people cannot leave the city.  The CCP virus outbreak has also impacted China's food imports.  China is asking foreign companies who send over meat and other food products to sign documents declaring that their products aren't contaminated with the virus.  The request followed China's allegation that the CCP virus was found in a market in Beijing on a cutting board to slice imported salmon.  So far, there's no known research data that suggests humans can catch the infection from food packaging.  What's more, the CCP virus mainly attacks the lungs, organs that are not present in fish.  As a result, it's commonly believed to be difficult for fish to get infected with this kind of virus.  At the same time, the U.S.  is urging China to meet the purchase commitments agreed to in the U.S.-China phase one trade deal.  The purchases include American agricultural products like lobster and beans.  Now we turn to the floods in southern and central China.  Rainstorms are expected to drench at least 10 Chinese provinces until next Tuesday.  Videos from the area show broken roads, collapsed bridges and fallen trees swept up by strong currents.  According to official figures, this year's flooding cost China almost three and a half billion dollars in direct economic losses, with hundreds of thousands displaced.  And these figures may be underreported. ",

Her belongings are scattered here and there.  Most of her bedding is tossed on the ground.  Broken furniture and appliances, among piles of unpacked clothes, cooking wares and her television, left out in the open.  This recent video was taken by a farmer from the Chinese northern province of Shandong.  Her home was demolished by authorities without her agreement and before she could find a place to stay.  She is weeping and murmuring while capturing the video.  This is not a single case.  It is the result of a policy called village merger in the province that started last year.  Farmers' houses are demolished, existing villages are merged, and farmers move into apartment buildings.  Farmers have strong opinions against the policy because it poses heavy financial burden on their households.  and the merger will fundamentally change their way of life in rural areas.  Some farmers have to live in temporary houses and even shacks.  The compensation from the regime is a mere 10 to 25 percent of the money farmers have to pay for their new apartments. ",

The discussion was proposed by EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs Joseph Borrell.  According to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, the Trump administration accepted the offer because the president doesn't want America's future to be shaped by the Chinese Communist Party, and he doubts his European counterparts want that either.  Pompeo said China's cover-up of its initial virus outbreak has helped people realize the threat China poses to the world.  But it's not only the cover-up.  Pompeo said China is also taking provocative military actions against countries worldwide.  That's why it's not only a problem between the U.S.  and China, but rather between the Chinese Communist Party and the rest of the globe.  He cited China's aggression in the South China Sea, deadly border confrontations in India, an opaque nuclear program and threats against its neighbors.  Upcoming talks between the U.S.  and the EU will reveal more about the specific actions planned.  The Canadian Security Intelligence Service warns that Canada is a target for Chinese interference.  The agency says the Chinese regime endangers the foundations of Canada's fundamental institutions, including its system of democracy.  Experts suggest the regime uses economic means to win the support of some influential Canadians.  The chair of Canada's National Security and Intelligence Committee says the Chinese Communist Party uses money rather than communist ideology as a powerful source of influence, creating parasitic relationships of long-term dependence.  He says Canada needs to up its game when it comes to blocking foreign interference.  The U.S.  is imposing new sanctions on a Hong Kong-based Chinese company accused of providing important supplies to Iran's metal industry.  Eight other companies related to the Iranian metal industry are also subject to U.S.  sanctions.  The penalties also keep these companies out of the U.S.  financial system.  Pompeo has said the U.S.  will continue to put maximum pressure on Iran until it behaves like a normal country.  And Pompeo says the U.S.  is shifting military presence to respond to the China-India border conflict.  During a virtual conference, he said that by withdrawing U.S.  troops from Germany, the U.S.  is now ready to face the threats posed by the Chinese regime to India and Southeast Asia.  Pompeo added that the U.S.  is making sure it's postured appropriately to handle what he called the challenge of our time.  A document related to a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier has recently appeared on the website for China's military.  It's prompted speculation that China has started building its first nuclear-powered ship.  At present, China has two traditionally powered aircraft carriers.  According to China news website NetEase, China is expected to build its first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier by 2025.  So far, only the U.S.  and France have nuclear-powered ships.  Shakut Masoman, a member of the Labor Party and lawmaker in New South Wales in Australia, has come under investigation by Australian authorities.  The controversial member of parliament has been a strong public supporter of China and has been showing signs of being in suspiciously close contact with Chinese officials.  Now his house in Sydney has been raided by Australian agencies.  New South Wales Labour leader Jody Mackay confirmed that she knew of the raids and the process was underway to suspend Mossoman from the party.  The FBI director says the agency is dealing with over 2,000 investigations tied to the Chinese Communist Party.  NTD's Miguel Moreno has more on those numbers and how the regime is using an economic angle to influence the U.S Chinese government is fighting a generational fight. ",

            "text": "India is planning to raise tariffs and impose strict inspection measures on Chinese imports.  The Indian Standards Department will toughen quality control for nearly 400 Chinese products.  It wants to ensure goods that can be made locally aren't imported.  India's finance ministry is considering raising taxes on imports like furniture and auto parts.  The trade ministry is looking for non-tariff ways to check Chinese imports like extra inspections, product testing and higher quality certification requirements.  India is the world's largest democracy and it's heavily dependent on other nations like China for raw materials and products.  The problem was made obvious after India went on lockdown in late March and the country faced a shortage of personal protective equipment.  The lockdown hurt, causing their first full-year economic decline in over 40 years.  According to the International Monetary Fund, India had a projected GDP growth of 1.9% in April but is now forecasting a 4.5% drop instead for the fiscal year through March 2021.  And recent border clashes between Chinese and Indian soldiers have caused an uproar across India.  20 Indian soldiers died in the military standoff.  Local politicians are calling to boycott Chinese-made goods, from toys and watches to plastic goods.  India's prime minister is asking citizens to be more self-reliant and to source and make products locally when possible.  India received the most imports from China last year.  It purchased nearly $70 billion worth of goods, including electronics, machinery and chemicals.  The IMF estimates India's $2.7 trillion economy will recover next year. ",
