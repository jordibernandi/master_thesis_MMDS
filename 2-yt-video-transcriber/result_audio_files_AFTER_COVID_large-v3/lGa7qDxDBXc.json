            "text": "Hello, I'm Nicole Michelle, founder and femininity influencer for the Inner Beauty Movement.  We're a movement all about helping women reconnect with their feminine core to be better women, wives, and mothers for their families and their communities.  And as a conservative traditional woman, I am finding it increasingly difficult to meet and connect with other conservative traditional women.  There is this notion that having morals and modesty is a thing of the past.  We're told that worshiping Jesus Christ is not cool, but Christian women are supposed to be tolerant and accepting of other spiritual beliefs and systems.  And young women are encouraged to postpone or reject marriage altogether in favor of the hookup culture.  Women are also told that if they become pregnant with an oops baby, they can terminate that pregnancy in the tune of millions per year.  And if you're a conservative woman and you don't want to pay for that with your tax dollars, you're wrong.  You're not a woman.  You're not for women's empowerment.  Conservative traditional women don't want to be over men or emasculate men or take over or some type of female supremacy.  They want to be by a man's side as a team, making each other better as a family.  We are not against men.  We're for men.  We don't want to sound like men.  We don't want to look like men.  We appreciate men for being men, but we want to be feminine women.  Conservative traditional women want to exercise their First Amendment rights, freedom of speech and freedom of religion to express their desires and ideas for faith, family and femininity.  We are no longer going to be shy about our love and we're going to reaffirm our faith in Jesus Christ and our desire to attend church instead of loot and riot in our cities.  We will support our armed forces and our law enforcement to protect our country and our communities.  We will no longer be shy about our Second Amendment rights to bear arms to protect what is ours.  I know I'm going to be called a coon or a sellout or who's put you up to this.  I can tell you... As a proud core American, an American descended of slaves, meaning I can trace my family back past the wall to 1840s Louisiana, I can tell you that I'm no longer going to be quiet or stifle my patriotism for this great country.  We are here and we are vibrant and we are no longer gonna be undercover.  And we will lead with love and compassion from the front instead of bashfulness from the shadows.  We will make our schools great again.  We will make our churches great again.  We will make our communities great again.  We will make our femininity great again.  We will make our relationships great again.  And we will make our families great again. ",
