No one should have to choose between protecting their health or exercising their right to vote.  But the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the way that most people in this country have voted in the past, in person on Election Day.  That's why we're fighting for the right of every eligible voter to vote by mail in the 2020 presidential election.  The good news is that today, most states already allow any eligible voter who wants to vote by mail to do so.  The bad news is that about 17 states currently don't.  Those states need to change their policies so that every eligible voter can vote by mail for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic.  But all states can go even farther.  They can mail every registered voter a ballot with an envelope that has prepaid postage and that's self-sealing.  At this time, however, it's important not to eliminate the option to vote in person.  There are a lot of voters who will continue to need that, voters who need assistance, like those with disabilities or with limited English language proficiency, voters who have limited access to the postal service, like Native Americans who are living on reservations.  And in many states, Voter registration is open up to and including on Election Day, and those voters shouldn't be disenfranchised just because they haven't received a ballot before then.  States are going to need some help, though.  The federal government can start with resources to assist states with processing what will likely be an unprecedented volume of mail-in ballots.  States will also need equipment to ensure the health and safety of people who vote in person, poll workers, and elections officials.  and states must process absentee ballots before election day as soon as possible to ensure that results can be reported in an efficient and expeditious manner.
