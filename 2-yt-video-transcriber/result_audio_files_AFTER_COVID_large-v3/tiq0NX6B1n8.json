            "text": "Yep, so they actually will store water mostly in their bloodstream.  Their blood cells are different than ours.  So most humans and then most mammals, we have circle-shaped red blood cells.  Theirs are oval-shaped, and they can expand to two and a half times their normal size to hold all of that water.  So they can go a long time without food or water.  Now, if you look at their legs, you guys might see some calluses on their legs.  They've got a big one on their chest called a pedestal.  That's so.  when they lay down, their joints are protected as well as their organs and their rib cage.  It supports them, it lifts them off the sand, and it allows them to not be burned by the hot sand either.  Now they've got those lovely feet.  They do not have hooves.  They actually have a foot.  They each have two toes with toenails each, and they kind of spread out when they walk.  So it kind of acts like a snowshoe for the desert.  So when they walk on those sandy dunes, they don't sink into the sand.  They kind of walk on top of them.  So they can weigh anywhere from 1200, 1400, 1600 pounds.  CJ over here likely weighs close to a ton, but they will not sink into the sand.  They actually just kind of walk on top of it.  And then a lot of people also ask us, what do we do with them in the wintertime?  Because a lot of people associate camels with warm temperatures.  And the answer is we really don't have to do anything, because camels are actually really well adapted to living in cold weather as well.  Deserts actually typically get very cold at night.  So camels can adjust their internal body temperature between 93 and 106 degrees and be totally fine.  They will grow these thick winter coats, which these guys have still.  They're all starting to shed.  It's shedding season.  They'll lose all that thick winter coat, and they'll have a very, very short coat through the summer. ",

They'll actually walk around the fence line after a snow and eat all the snow off the top of the fence.  They'll roll in it.  They'll play in it.  So they really enjoy the winter.  And those Bactrian camels, the two hump camels, they're actually found sometimes in the Himalayan mountains, which can be as cold as negative 40 degrees Fahrenheit, and they are fine.  we really don't have to do much for our camels in the winter.  they do just fine with the cold temperatures as well.

So we actually just have this chute over here.  So the camel stays standing all the time and he can just walk in this chute and we'll have the people just get on him while he's still standing.  So it's right at the level for people to just kind of step on and over that saddle and then we strap you guys in and then we do a nice figure eight here.
