            "text": "Hi guys, this is your sister Karen Gidden in Jesus Christ.  Brothers and sisters, I had a vision concerning the beautiful country, South Africa.  And, you know, it's quite amazing how the Most High keeps showing me pockets of these individual countries from the continent of Africa.  Now I'm going to share this video, this vision that I had concerning South Africa and it's a warning vision really unlike the other visions concerning Africa such as Kenya where I saw a revelation where Mount Sinai I've said is found in Kenya, Solomon's Temple is found in Zimbabwe, Congo you have very rich with the gold and minerals and all that and other parts of africa where the tribe of jude and levi were standing together.  so the most high is moving.  but you know he chose to tell me um a warning message one vision concerning South Africa and I pray that it will be received by my South African brothers and sisters in the Most High.  So the vision begins like this.  I had it on the 23rd, 23rd of May 2020.  And the vision begins like this brothers and sisters.  I found myself standing.  It wasn't really a lot of houses where I was, but some houses were there.  And as I was standing there, brothers and sisters, I had no idea where I was.  And around me were angels and they were all dressed military.  You know, they're all dressed in military suits and that they were ready for battle.  And one of the angels turned to me and said, you are in South Africa.  Okay, that's what he said to me.  He said, you are in South Africa.  Brothers and sisters, when the angel said that to me, it's like I had a vision within a vision.  I can't explain it.  I don't know if other people have had a vision.  So I was having this vision and then there was another vision within this vision.  So as the angel said to me, you are in South Africa.  All of a sudden I was standing there and another vision appeared.  came in front of me and i saw soldiers tracking to come into south africa.  okay they were tracking to come into south africa.  and then that vision uh just disappeared within this vision.  and when that vision disappeared the all of the southern brothers and sisters i heard the.  oh this is the father speaking because Once you're trained in Him, you will distinguish the voices.  You can know the voice of the Holy Spirit, the voice of God the Father.  And just like the vision that I gave when I was in America in the ghetto and the voice of the Most High, God the Father spoke and said, these are my Hebrew children.  It's the same exact voice.  same exact exact voice spoke.  and when he spoke brothers and sisters okay when the voice spoke he said tell my people this is key because not everybody in South Africa is God's people.  so you know so because the message was tell my people.  so these people are there.  and he said tell my people to hide.  and And he gave the name of a place, brothers and sisters, when I was in the vision, I could remember the name of this place.  When I came out of the vision, unfortunately, it just completely went.  But he said, tell my people to hide at this certain place.  And I begin with the angels.  We begin walking, not even walk, we're running.  were literally running in South Africa to and fro through these houses, knocking on the doors and just telling them the message that the Most High said, go and hide, take your belongings, take your stuff, you must go now, you must go now.  So we were just going from houses to houses to houses to houses, telling the South African people all these messages, brothers and sisters, to go and hide at this particular location that the Most High told us, well, tell me to tell them along with the Warren Angels that was beside me.  and then before the vision ended brothers and sisters it was like Chaos, just as we were warning the people to leave your house ASAP, you must go to this location.  It was like chaos just about to begin, just about to begin.  But they were receiving the message and people were packing their bags, taking their family.  And the beauty about this is that they know exactly the location.  Because I had no idea.  I just was passing on the message.  you know but I had no idea where they were going but they knew.  you know these brothers and sisters knew exactly where this location was and they were just going and then the vision ended.  when I came out the vision obviously you know I knew I was going to share it uh on my YouTube channel and Like with other visions concerning Africa, it's not really war of such.  It's always artifacts, you know, ancient things that the Lord brings back.  But with South Africa, this is quite different because this is an invasion.  So when I came out the vision, brothers and sisters, I said to the Lord, what is this?  The Lord began to speak to my heart.  So those men that I was with, those were angels.  Those are warring.  Hallelujah.  These are warring angels all over South Africa, over his people.  So the Most High is still protecting his people regardless.  Hallelujah.  He's still protecting them.  But what's interesting, brothers and sisters, is the vision that I had within this vision where I saw soldiers.  coming into South Africa.  And as I said, when I came up with the vision, I was saying, Lord, what is this?  What is going to go on in South Africa?  Very, very strongly, brothers and sisters, the Holy Spirit began to speak to me.  And it was so clear that the South African government has sold out the Africans, the South Africans.  God's people let me make that very clear because not everybody in South Africa belongs to the most high.  so that has to be very very clear.  okay not everyone in South Africa belongs to Yah belongs to the most high.  so the instruction in this vision is to warn them.  and this is a warning message to you South Africans those of you who know that you belong to the most high.  An invasion because of your government that has sold you out is coming in South Africa.  It doesn't mean that all of Africa will be invaded.  No, no.  But South Africa, for some reason, What I saw, I saw that particular invasion and it's because your government has sold you out.  They've done it already.  It's a done deal.  But the Most High is going to move you out before they invade.  Now, the Lord also told me that when I was knocking on your doors, telling you to go to this particular place to hide, this is the wilderness.  Glory to God.  And it's so amazing that the day, I think the day before, so the day after I've put out that video, hope and excitement for the regathering.  the re-gathering of israel the true israel.  i got this vision the day after.  so the lord allowed me to know that the exodus is coming up.  this is your exodus south africa.  the most high is going to move you out hallelujah he's going to move you out.  it's not your country you know.  it's very because When I was talking to the Lord concerning Africa, because the Most High only gives me pockets of little things.  It doesn't overload my mind.  And I thank Him for that.  But I believe that, I think, especially in Africa, because those of us in the Caribbean, well, some of us, not everybody, in the Caribbean, in America, and other pockets of the world, we know we don't belong there.  Okay?  We know that that is not our home.  Now in Africa, what I picked up in my spirit when I came out of this vision, and it never ever occurred to me, just because you are in Africa, you're living in Kenya, you're living in, where, Botswana, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Congo, Cameroon, and you're all over the place in Africa, it doesn't mean that that is your particular country because you were scattered.  Do you understand what I'm saying?  You were scattered.  So with South Africa and God's people being in, God is going to move you out.  That is not your location.  You were scattered there.  Okay?  That is very strong when it came out of the vision.  And that is why he's going to move you out in the second exodus where we all will be gathered together.  Okay, that is coming up very, very, very, very near.  The second exodus is very, very near.  But just before the invasion that I saw in South Africa, the Most High is going to move.  He's going to move on angels.  Hallelujah.  Because this is not going to be man's doing.  The Most High Promise, it says in, I think it's Isaiah, Isaiah chapter 11 or chapter 12, where it said, with a stretched forth hand, the Most High, he the most high will gather.  so it's not going to be a man thing okay it's going to be the more when it's done.  and this is why we're and this is why we're going to do a beautiful dance in the wilderness because when it's done you are going to know that this is yeah that this is the most high that has done this that has gathered uh the 12 trials back together.  but yeah.  so just because you're in africa it doesn't mean that that is your location.  It doesn't mean that, okay?  Because we all need to be gathered in one place, and he's going to do it.  But the Lord gave him this vision about South Africa.  It's a warning vision.  You know, I saw the invasion.  When I came out, the Mosiah told me, your government has sold you out.  God's people have been sold out, but he's going to rescue you.  Okay?  So continue.  Continue.  um in the integrity of the most high walk with him.  this is the time south africans that you need to be very very close.  no playing games or anything like that.  this is a time that you have to be 100 with him with the lord.  not only south africa but all Everybody, including myself, you know, who belongs, who belongs to the Most High.  So stay focused.  Stay focused.  We're praying for Africa, you know.  We are really, really, really, really praying for the continent.  You will be okay through the power of the Holy Spirit.  I believe that.  I believe that.  It was quite interesting. ",
