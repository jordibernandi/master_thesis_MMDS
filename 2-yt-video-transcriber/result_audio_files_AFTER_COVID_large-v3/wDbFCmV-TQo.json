And the people responsible are the head of police, Cressida, and our lovely mayor, Sadiq.  Now, we've seen over the past few weeks with the A small group of radical left-wing loonies running around, shifting the agenda, running the narrative, and causing chaos on the streets.  And no one's doing anything about this.  The police have been... I understand that the British police is there to maintain peace rather than just enforce the law, but they've been absolutely useless, not specifically because of the individual police officers.  A lot of them are very robust, they care about law and order, but because of people like her.  The head of Metropolitan Police and the Mayor of London who is responsible for policing in London.  Now, we had an incident in Brixton a couple of nights ago.  We're going to talk about that in this video.  We're also going to talk about how Priti Patel, the Home Secretary, is finally stepping in.  Anyway, it's about time, but at least something's been done.  So Priti is not happy.  She's the Home Secretary.  This morning, she demanded to see the head of Metropolitan Police first thing in the morning, like an emergency last-minute telling-off session, and to find out what's actually been happening with the Met, what's the direction, and how is it?  every time these left-wing Marxists come out in the streets they can do whatever they want to do and even though Parliament have made mass gatherings and essentially protests and peaceful marches illegal they're still doing it and the police are essentially promoting it saying guys you're coming out good but let's maintain the peace.  they're not supposed to be coming out.  so in terms of what happened in Brixton Priti Patel said well she did.
