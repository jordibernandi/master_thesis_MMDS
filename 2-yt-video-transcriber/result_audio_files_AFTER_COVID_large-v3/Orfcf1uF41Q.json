            "text": "Today on our YouTube channel, I want to make an observation with some information that I have been looking into and researching about what you're not being told.  Now, one of the only ways that you can actually get information that is not being discussed on the major media cable news sites is through different forms of social media.  However, in some instances, certain types of information is now being either banned or silenced.  But there is other information that is forthcoming that is out there and observations being made by professional economists, not prophecy teachers, prophets or biblical scholars, but people who are in the now knowing the economy.  And it has to do with what I call the pandemic economy.  NOW, WE KNOW THAT BEFORE COVID-19 STRUCK THAT THE UNITED STATES WAS IN A LEVEL OF ECONOMIC BLESSING AND PROSPERITY, JOB INCREASES, FACTORIES BEING MOVED BACK TO THE UNITED STATES ON A LEVEL THAT HAD NOT BEEN IN MANY, MANY, MANY YEARS.  WE KNOW THAT IN PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS THAT THERE WERE NUMEROUS RESTRICTIONS AND REGULATIONS THAT WERE PASSED THAT COST SMALL BUSINESSES ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF MONEY, that caused corporations to leave the United States and go to China and Mexico.  And so this was changed for a while, but now things are going to shift again and change again.  So what I want to talk about is the impact that you're going to see in the next couple of months, probably during 2021, of what's called the pandemic economy.  Now, I want you to consider, first of all, sports.  My wife is an Alabama football fan.  I am too.  Please don't hold that against me.  But we were able to go to several games this year.  One was in Mercedes Benz Stadium and one was in Tuscaloosa.  And ministry partners helped us to be able to do that, some dear friends.  However, to look at that stadium, Bryant-Denny Stadium, with only 16,000 people there, and then Mercedes-Benz Stadium at the championship playoff game with 15,000 people, it was actually surreal.  Now what that means is that in all of the college sporting towns, whether it's the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, whether it's Columbus, Ohio, that their economy with the restaurants, the hotels, and even the stadium economy for the universities because they divide the ticket sales up has plummeted to a level that those college towns that did not activate their sports programs have lost hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars.  That's point one.  You know, some of these hotels have huge mortgages on them, and they didn't fill them up.  The outskirt hotels, I probably should clarify that.  Then we also have the theaters.  Now, some theaters are slowly beginning to open.  However, there are a number of bankruptcies that have occurred in theaters because they cannot pay the mortgages on their buildings.  Many theaters are located in mall areas or the area where there have been malls that have actually gone under in some of the northern states.  The mall just doesn't exist.  They completely closed down because of COVID.  Then in small businesses, And we're being told, and again, I'm not the specialist.  I'm only relaying to you information that's out there.  Forty percent of the businesses in New York, small businesses, may be lost and never open again because the people cannot pay their mortgages.  There also will come a lot of home mortgage problems from millions of homes of individuals who've lost their job or haven't been able to work and are not able to pay their mortgage payments.  And of course, you have restaurants, you have banks taking over the building.  So from those who are economic specialists, the worst pandemic economy is not behind us.  Here's the reason why.  Because there is discussion that this COVID-2, which is a, it's more, you know, COVID is, you know, flus do this anyway.  They morph into another kind of flu.  And that's why, you know, they make you get a flu shot every year.  I've never taken a flu shot personally.  I've been blessed not to get the flu until recently.  But, and I didn't take the shot, but I got the flu recently, but recovered from that.  But the point is, We see people are leaving, millions of people are leaving California.  I don't know the numbers of New York City, but the apartments are sitting empty in New York.  People are leaving by the drugs.  California, and what this does, they have to raise taxes to pay their state expenses, city expenses, and all of the budgets that they have and retirements that they have.  And yet when the people leave, the tax base is gone, and then they have to raise taxes on the people that are there.  And we already know that President-elect Biden, and I'm going to go ahead and say that because the deep state has controlled this thing, and I think most of you can see it.  when he comes in, has already said that he's going to raise taxes.  And how do you raise taxes on an economy where people don't have jobs?  Well, that puts pressure on the people who are working.  So it's actually about to be one of the biggest messes that we have seen probably since the Great Depression of 1929, 1930s.  Now, THE IMPACT IS GOING TO LAST LONGER THAN WHAT WE HAVE ANTICIPATED.  AGAIN, I'M NOT REPEATING THIS AS A PROPHECY FROM THE LORD.  I'M VERY CAREFUL OF NOT MIXING WHAT THE HOLY SPIRIT GIVES ME WITH WHAT MY OPINION IS.  BUT THEY'RE SAYING THEY WANT MORE LOCKDOWNS.  IN FACT, THE  U.K.,  AUSTRALIA, PLACES LIKE THIS IN AUSTRALIA, THEY CAN'T EVEN GO OUT OF THEIR HOMES AT THIS POINT.  I FOUND THAT OUT LAST WEEK WHEN PREACHING IN OHIO FROM PEOPLE THAT WERE WATCHING US FROM AUSTRALIA.  They want to raise taxes, and people may not have the income for it.  And probably one thing that concerns me is when President Trump opened up areas for drilling for gas and for the fossil fuels, the president-elect, and I'm saying that again as planned, has made the statement that he's going to do away with all fossil fuels.  Now, what that means, let's just make it clear.  It means that if he reverses, which he plans to do, All of the drilling that we're doing, that we who are now the... We've been independent for the past couple years from China's and from the Middle Eastern oil, but now we're going to go back dependent on those countries, and you're going to start paying prices $3 to $6 a gallon.  It could be higher in states like California where there's high taxes, and it may even get worse than that if this plan comes into effect because it's all a part of this quote-unquote Green New Deal.  Now, speaking of the Green New Deal... And again, I'm going by people who have researched this, not my own research, but other individuals.  The Green New Deal would require you, for example, in your home, your business, and this includes churches, to go in and redo all of your electrical fixtures to use a certain type of light bulb.  SOME OF YOU THAT HAVE THE OLD SCHOOL WAYS OF DOING IT WOULD HAVE TO PURCHASE.  NOW WE'VE ALREADY DONE THAT A COUPLE YEARS BACK.  WE USE ALL LED, WHICH IS CHEAPER, PRODUCES LESS HEAT, AND ALSO IS ECONOMICAL.  SO, YOU KNOW, PRETTY MUCH OUR MINISTRY HAS DONE THAT.  HOWEVER, IN ONE OF OUR BIG FACILITIES HERE, WE HAVE 16 AIR CONDITIONED UNITS.  NOW THESE UNITS CAME OUT OF CHINA.  HOWEVER, WE FOUND OUT THAT THESE UNITS ARE NO LONGER MADE, AND WE HAVE A HARD TIME FINDING PARTS.  UNDER THE GREEN NEW DEAL, YOU WOULD HAVE TO USE A CERTAIN TYPE OF HEATING AND AIR UNIT, WHICH MEANS EVERYTHING YOU'VE GOT WOULD EVENTUALLY, AND I'M SAYING EVENTUALLY, MAYBE NOT IMMEDIATELY OVER TIME, HAVE TO BE REPLACED.  AND PROBABLY FOR MOST PEOPLE, THAT'S GOING TO COME RIGHT OUT OF YOUR OWN POCKET.  SO THIS GREEN NEW DEAL HAS BEEN ESTIMATED WHEN IT'S ALL SET AND DONE AT $100 TRILLION.  But they are set on making a Green New Deal.  Now, if the Senate was on the Republican side and the House on the Democrat side, you'd have a hard time passing that.  But now the Democrats, most of them who believe in the Green New Deal, are immediately going to go to work on this.  And this brings another economic hardship.  Now, concerning the pandemic, there have been pandemics from the 1350s up to 1918.  In fact, there were 15 different plagues there.  In 1918, 100 million people died because of the Spanish flu, the Spanish influenza.  So COVID, please excuse me.  Looks like it's going to be the third largest pandemic in world history.  And, of course, it's still out there.  Now, we'll add this, and I want to say this.  We received calls from doctors.  We have nurse friends who work in hospitals who have told me personally and told my wife that every death in a hospital is now being tagged as COVID.  One doctor, and again, I'm only going by the information I have, contacted us and said that someone had a massive heart attack and they put it under COVID because it's Each hospital gets more government funding or more support if it goes under COVID.  So your numbers are going up.  And honestly, you don't know if those numbers deal with influenza A or COVID or if it's, you know, one guy had a motorcycle accident in Florida and this was reported in the news and they put it under COVID.  And so that's not a good thing because you don't know what the real numbers are.  You don't know, you know, again, I think that Lewinsky, who was You know, Obama read his material, was like a mentor to Obama, said, never waste a crisis.  And so I think that's what these certain unscrupulous individuals are doing.  Now, what is happening here, and I'm not going to spend a lot of time on this, is this is creating the opportunity for what's called a new world order or a global reset.  Now, here's the part that concerns me the most of everything, because we've had hard economic times in the past, and the American people are very resolute in that they're somehow able to make it through so many different crises throughout history, through the terrorism, through the Great Depression, through the wars we've had, Revolutionary War and Civil War.  But my greatest concern deals with how this vaccine, if COVID continues at the level that they say it is at, is going to be manipulated because they're now saying in parts of Europe that you have to take the vaccine and have a green passport to leave the United States and enter these particular countries.  one nation has announced that unless their people their it's mandatory vaccine in this particular country that unless you take the vaccine you will not be able to go into any store to work in the store that's your job or to buy from the store without having a piece of paper that you have taken the vaccine.  Now, there are people that said, oh, I'm afraid of taking it because it has a tracking device.  Look, can I show you something?  Please pay attention to me here because that was almost laughable and I'm not making fun of a vaccine or anything like that, but watch this.  Here's your tracking device.  You see this here?  This is your tracking device.  They can... Every time you use this with a text message, a video, or a phone call, it goes to a cell tower.  From that cell tower, the federal government can get any information they want.  Now, this is not fake news, but see that camera right there?  I know for a fact that any time that, let's say... certain people have access want to tap into they can watch you on your laptop on your phone also your speaker if you've ever noticed you have your phone on your side like a hamburger any go.  and also this hamburger advertisements.  not a man that runs a company who puts those advertisements up told told told me that this this system works all the time.  everything you say can be fed into a computer anytime.  so my point is here's your tracking device And everybody's got to have a phone, you know, unless you're in a home the rest of your life with a landline.  Everybody's got to have a phone.  Your computer can track information.  Your phone tracks everything.  They collect data.  That's what they've been doing for years.  So here's your tracking.  So if you got a phone, you know, vaccine, no vaccine.  Here's your tracking device that they're already doing that.  So I just want to let you know that.  But some of the things that.  that concern me are also is the controlling of free speech.  And I'll do a special on that and tell you why they have done what they have done later on.  And, of course, by the time it's up, it won't be later on.  You'll be able to see it.  So we'll talk about that later on another one.  But what we need to do is understand that we're going to have to have new methods of communication among people.  INDIVIDUALS IN THE UNITED STATES, AND THIS IS PROBABLY THE EVANGELICAL COMMUNITY, THE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY, THE CATHOLIC CHURCH, ALL OF US WHO ARE BELIEVERS WHO BELIEVE IN JESUS CHRIST ARE GOING TO COME UNDER A LOT OF PERSECUTION AND PRESSURE.  SO THERE NEEDS TO BE A NEW WAY OF COMMUNICATION.  AND SOME OF THAT WILL HAVE TO BE, AND I WANT TO SAY IT, OFF THE GRID.  AND SO I WENT TO COMMUNIST COUNTRIES YEARS AGO, RIGHT WHEN COMMUNISM FELL.  And I found out that what they did is they used paper notes, handed paper notes, and like, we're going to meet at a certain place.  because if they got on the phone, all their phone calls were monitored by the communist police in Bulgaria and Romania, especially in Russia, of course.  But Bulgaria is where I got this information.  And they would actually pray so much that the Spirit of the Lord would tell them where to go and who to meet and where to have a service.  And they would all show up.  It was so fascinating that they learned to tune their ear to the voice of the Lord.  that clear.  But they used paper in which they would write the note and they would burn the paper.  There was no tracking of it, no evidence of it that way.  Now you say, it's not going to get that bad in America.  Folks, you have to listen to me.  The same spirits that controlled Hitler in Germany, the same spirits that controlled Stalin to do away with Bibles and Christian churches, it's a spirit.  It's not just people's ideology.  It's not just a cultural clash.  It is a demonic principality spirit.  And when communism fell, now watch this, when the communism fell in these certain nations, when it collapsed in Russia, when all these particular spirits collapsed in Germany, Where have they gone and where have they been?  Well, here's the answer.  They have found a position in the heavenlies over Washington, D.C.  And I'm telling you, I believe that with all of my heart.  Read Daniel chapter 10 about the prince of Persia and the prince of Grisha.  Most of all, we have got to, if we are patriots, if we're conservatives, if we are Christians, and I put all of those together in the same group because all of us are going to be having to deal with this immediately.  We already are.  THEN WE HAVE TO LEARN TO PRAY, LEARN HOW TO TRUST GOD, LEARN HOW TO WORK TOGETHER AND STAND TOGETHER AND ASK THE LORD FOR HIS HELP AND HIS GRACE AND HIS MERCY.  ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE AS BELIEVERS IS THE POWER OF PRAYER.  AND WHEN THE EARLY CHURCH BEGAN TO PRAY, Judgment would come on those evil leaders.  Herod had an angel touch him in his intestines and he ended up dying with worms in five days.  God has the power.  Now we're not saying we need to go around praying for angels to take out people.  But if it got that bad and it gets that bad, we have prayer ability to call on the Lord for his angelic assistance.  and His assistance in general.  Never forget that we are part of a kingdom that cannot be moved, cannot be shaken, and will never end.  The gates of hell will fight the church, but Jesus said it can't prevail.  It still exists after 2,000 years of persecution.  So there is an entity on the earth, the church.  There is a kingdom on the earth, the kingdom of God.  And the kingdom of God, by the way, I hate to tell some of you leftists out there, but the kingdom of God is what's going to take this thing over one day anyway.  So you have a very limited time for your control and your anti-Christian, anti-God, atheistic ideology.  You have a very limited time.  So enjoy it while you can.  Because guess what?  You're going to see my face one day in the millennium.  And... the faces of a lot of these other people that you're saying things about.  So we're going to teach the kingdom is coming.  Repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.  That's going to be the message.  And the Bible said the gospel of the kingdom shall be preached and then the end would come.  So you're going to start hearing a lot of messages on the kingdom.  Roman Empire hated Christians because they believed there was another king besides the emperor, and that was Jesus.  And there was another kingdom called the kingdom of God besides the empire of Rome.  And so that's why the persecution broke out.  Well, guess what?  That kingdom still exists.  That kingdom is invisible at this point but will be made visible.  And so the people of God, we're not going anywhere until the rapture.  And then we're going to let you have this thing for seven years.  And after you mess it up and blow it up and burn it up and destroy it, Jesus is going to come back and rescue what's left.  So that's in the Bible too.  So I want to encourage you to focus on your faith, your prayer life, focus on the kingdom of God and realize that perilous times are here.  This is no longer prophecy preaching.  It's no longer a book you read.  We're now in it.  And if we are, it's the time of the end in the last days.  So let's keep the faith and hold on to the Lord.  I will give you a special update on why people are being silenced that you may not have thought of.  And I want you to watch that one when it comes out.  Thank you so much.
