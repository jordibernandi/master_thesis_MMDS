This top secret Pentagon report is said to confirm everything UFO researchers have been saying for years.  The Roswell crash, Bob Lazar, Area 51 and Skinwalker Ranch, all confirmed by actual declassified US government documents.  But why now?  Why is the government releasing all this info right now?  The world is on the brink of chaos.  We have COVID-19, riots in multiple cities across America, growing civil unrest, and some say we're on the brink of a new civil war.  So why the sudden rush towards UFO disclosure?  Well, it's simple really, and former President Ronald Reagan has the answer to this question. ",

The Bible is 100% clear on this matter, and it proves that these UFOs are not piloted by so-called space aliens, but rather what we would call fallen angels.  In fact, the Bible talks about a great end times deception involving UFOs, but we'll get into that a little later in this video.  Right now, we're going to take a look at some of the latest articles coming out on this matter.  On July 23, 2020, Tucker Carlson shocked the world when he said this on his live Fox News broadcast.

We know very little about what they've found.  But apparently, just recovered are off-world vehicles not made on this Earth.  That's a direct quote. ",

            "text": "The following day, multiple articles were released, going into more detail.  The Intelligencer reports on July 24, 2020, quote, The Pentagon has reportedly found off-world vehicles not made of this Earth.  Also, Fox News releases an article entitled, quote, With Pentagon UFO unit in the spotlight, reports mention off-world vehicles not made of this Earth.  Let's take a closer look at this Fox News article.  A long-hidden UFO investigative unit within the Pentagon will make some of its findings public, according to the New York Times report.  The unit, which is now part of the Office of Naval Intelligence, has spent over a decade discussing mysterious events in classified briefings, according to the news outlet.  A government contractor told the Times that he gave a classified briefing to the Department of Defense in March describing retrievals from \"...off-world vehicles not made of this  earth.\".  The Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon Task Force at the Office of Naval Intelligence was described in a Senate Intelligence Committee report last month.  The unit standardizes collection and reporting on unidentified aerial phenomenon, any links they have to adversarial foreign governments, and the threat they pose to U.S.  military assets and installations, the report says.  However, the committee remains concerned that there is no unified, comprehensive process within the federal government for collecting and analyzing intelligence on unidentified aerial phenomena, despite the potential threat, it added.  The New York Times reports that a small group of government officials and scientists believe that objects of, quote, undetermined origin have crashed to Earth and been retrieved, including former Senator Harry Reid.  While some have been found to be man-made materials, there are question marks over others.  The publication cites Eric W. Davis, an astrophysicist who worked as a subcontractor and a consultant for the Pentagon UFO program.  Davis, who now works for defense contractor Aerospace Corporation, said he also gave briefings on the recovery of unexplained objects to staff members of the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Senate Intelligence Committee on October 21st and October 23rd, 2019, respectively.  The article goes on to say, In speaking with the New York Times, Reid said he believes the government and the private sector may have retrieved materials from unidentified objects.  After looking into this, I came to the conclusion that there were reports, some were substantive, some not so substantive, that there were actual materials that the government and the private sector had in their possession, Reid said in an interview.  Reed's comments are the latest from the former lawmaker.  In June 2019, he told Nevada's KNPR that he wished lawmakers would hold public hearings into what the military knows.  He said they would be surprised how the American public would accept it, Reed said during the wide-ranging interview.  Why do you think they're so confident people will accept it?  Could it have anything to do with the inundation of propaganda material such as ancient aliens and the like?  Now, for those of you who are unaware, there is a man named Bob Lazar who claimed that he worked in a secret government facility named S4.  and his job was to try and reverse engineer these off-world vehicles and try and figure out how they worked.  There was a decades-long drama surrounding Bob Lazar and his story, but many independent investigators and journalists have concluded that yes, he is telling the truth.  Recently, Bob Lazar was interviewed on the popular Joe Rogan Experience podcast, and he said something that would go on to send shockwaves through the UFO community.  At least one of them was part of an archaeological dig.  So it's old.  At least one of them is old.  I don't know if it was the one I worked on, but I remember something to do with an archaeological dig.  That means it's not just old, it's ancient.  So Bob Lazar is claiming that at least one of the nine off-world vehicles was found in an archaeological dig.  Hmm, interesting.  The Bible tells us about a time like this, a time long ago filled with high technology, genetic manipulation, sorcery, and wickedness.  We refer to this time as the Antediluvian Era, or the time before the flood of Noah, which also coincides with the New Age teachings of Atlantis.  Christian author G.H.  Pember wrote extensively about this in his book entitled, Earth's Earliest Ages.  Timothy Albarino does a good job at breaking this book down in his Albarino analysis.  Here is a clip of that video.

            "text": "Concerning the days of Noah.  pember has much to say.  he believed that the very same vices that led to the judgment of the great flood in the second age were destined to be repeated in the closing chapter of this present age and so lead to the final judgment that will descend upon the earth in a fury of fire before the coming of the lord.  He takes particular interest in what he terms the eruption of fallen angels into the world of men, as recorded in Genesis 6, which subsequently fomented an explosion of rebellion and wickedness that brought the world to ruin.  Pember defines seven causes of antediluvian corruption and analyzes the extent of their influence in the society of his day.  As we review these seven points, we must keep in mind that they were written in 1876.  They may be summed up as follows.  A rapid progression in the mechanical arts and the consequent invention of many devices whereby the hardships of the curse were mitigated and life was rendered more easy and indulgent.  Also a proficiency in the fine arts which captivated the minds of men and helped to induce an entire oblivion of God.  the appearance upon the earth of beings from the principality of the air and their unlawful intercourse with the human race.  It should be abundantly apparent to any rational mind that these seven causes of antediluvian corruption are not only present in the society of the twenty-first century, but have greatly metastasized and grown to full maturity since the late nineteenth century, when Pember first recognized them in the dawn of their infancy.  In other words, although these seven points accurately describe the days in which George Pember lived, they are frighteningly more relevant to the days in which we now live, portending the imminence of the final judgment and destruction of this world and the return of the king.

In order to understand the next piece of this puzzle, we need to take a look at Skinwalker Ranch and the Defense Intelligence Agency's secret program named Advanced Aerospace Weapons Systems Applications Program, or OSAP.  By the way, I have a video on Skinwalker Ranch.  Please check it out if you haven't seen it already.  You can find a link in the description or in the top right corner of the screen.  Okay, so back to OSAP.  Investigative reporter George Knapp reports that a high-level Pentagon official visited Skinwalker Ranch during the OSAP investigation.  While he was there, something strange happened to him.  He had an experience.  Upon further investigation, the Pentagon actually came to the conclusion that what was happening there was demonic in nature.  Here is George Knapp telling the story in his own words. ",

He has an experience.  Something appears inside a house that only he can see.  He doesn't say anything about it.  He goes back to Washington, meets with Harry Reid in the Capitol and two other U.S.  senators.  He presents them a study of UFOs and related phenomena, not just like AATIP, looking at flying saucers that encounter U.S.  military, but something more expansive.  They put out a contract.  Bigelow creates an organization called BASS, puts together a team of experts, 50 or 60 employees, looking at whether there are connections between blind saucers, possible aliens, and all these other different phenomena.  The program goes on for a couple of years, and somebody yanks the funding.  The reason that the DIA suddenly became worried about all this weirdness that was being reported at Skinwalkers, because they thought it was demonic.  and they thought we might be invoking Satan in here.  These were fundamentalist Christians in the Pentagon who pulled the money because they thought it was the devil. ",

What's interesting is with the abduction phenomena, it parallels what we see in Scripture.  It really does.  If these are fallen angels, they have the same properties and the same abilities as the good angels have.  And so we see when Peter is in the jail cell, chained to a wall, a good angel appears to him.  Peter looks around.  He's not sure he's asleep or awake.  Mind fog.  Angel tells him to get up.  Peter gets up.  His chains fall off of him.  Manipulation of space, time, and matter.  The jail cell opens up by itself.  There's no lock.  There's a lock, but there's no key to that.  Jail cell opens up.  Peter finds himself in the hallway.  All the Roman guards are switched off.  They're asleep.  Roman guards who fall asleep fall on their own sores the next day.  Thank you.  So Roman guards don't fall asleep.  They go outside to the courtyard.  The gateway opens up by itself, the huge prison gate.  They walk a little bit.  The angel disappears.  That is exactly the same type of circumstances and dynamics that we see in the alien abduction phenomena.  People are switched off.  Matter is floating through walls, floating through this.  It's the same deal.  The fallen angels are doing the same stuff that the good angels do, only for very nefarious means.  And this abduction phenomena.  I've interviewed Dr.  Jacobs, and it's nefarious.  The ending of this thing, I believe, is incredibly malevolent, very nefarious.  It's not good for human beings at all.  And I think, as Jacobs believes also, that this abduction phenomenon and so-called subsequent breeding program has reached its conclusion. ",

In the end days, I think that we're going to see out of the skies.  We're going to see... Because that's where the scripture locates what in the Greek is called Cosmicrotters, Archon.  These beings are there.  And part of in-time deception, you see the numbers just off the charts nowadays.  So I think they are absolutely real.  They are there.  They're not what the world thinks they are.  When Jesus said, in my Father's house there are many realms, many rooms.  That's the word he used.  So I think it is dimensional.  Whether it's layered or just multi, that I don't know.  But... I think there's realms different than ours, and they're just beyond us or around us, but I think that they're realities also.  And I think that's where... We're seeing things coming through our side from those other realms.  We need to understand them as the Spirit of God reveals them in the original Greek, Cosmocrater, Archon, Exousia.  These beings were different in specie or type.  I mean, they're all the same in nature.  But they are huge in the sense of, in comparison to humanity.  They're superhuman.  They're beyond us.  So when I think in terms of... We us contacting them like we deal with deliverance there has to be a doorway for them to get over.  if this is a kind of the wall between the worlds here And they're wanting to get over and biblically we know this we know this in dealing with deliverance They want to get over to this side.  There's no question.  so the issue is how do they come through the barrier?  how do they come physically through or to where they're manifesting through.  So I believe that means there has to be a gateway doorway portal, a Greek word used is topon, a legal access but the idea also of a way.  So I think that on this side of the fence if we have learned What I believe would be given by them a cult means, whether that's psychic meditations, ritual summonings, sacred tones, whatever the method in calling across through this barrier.  That is a call.  That is a summoning.  We as believers in Christ, we call on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.  We read in Psalm 68, summon your power, O God.  So, the laws of engagement are the same when it comes to the dark side.  Now, here's the biggest issue I have with the dark side.  It's all absolutely real.  They're more than we can even imagine.  But the other Greek word I want to always emphasize is metaskismazo.  The word that says when Satan's able to masquerade, transfigure as an angel of light.  That's the physics of the dark side.  Literally to be able to morph their appearance without changing their nature. ",

The UFOs we're seeing today are primarily all satanic vehicles, and we have built a number of these underground and underwater undersea bases for these fallen ones.  And we were getting our technology from them, and we were letting them do genetic experiments on humans and animals here.  In the late 70s, just after I left the organization, in the late 70s, we were kicked out.  Humans were kicked out of our own bases by these alleged aliens.
