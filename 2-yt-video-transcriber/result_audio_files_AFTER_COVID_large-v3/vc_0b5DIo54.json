Now, as you can see here, in the seven days up to the 17th of January, for every million people that live in the UK, 16.5 people have died on average every day.  Now, you'll note, because this is up to the 17th of January, this was before the previous two, you know, the last two record-breaking days we've had, so presumably this will be higher now.  You can see we're above every other country in the world.  the world.  Now this is a record which should shame this government.  But when grilled about the figures on ITV this morning, Home Secretary Priti Patel refused to accept that the government had any responsibility at all for the human disaster currently afflicting Britain.

It's because we have an incompetent government who have failed to learn their mistakes, who ignore experts, who have ignored what frontline workers have been saying, and repeatedly have failed to act until it's too late.  I just, I'm literally so angry watching that.  And we've seen this, you know, the current, throughout this pandemic, the government refusing to actually apologise for their mistakes, apologise for this horrendous death toll, and then going on to the media to blame the public.  And actually... Well done, Piers Morgan, for calling that out, because I think too much of the media has just been falling for this narrative that it's somehow the public's fault that we have the worst death toll in the world, when actually we know that it's a result of this government's policies and their failings that we are suffering such huge death rates.  You know, I told you about that, you know, a horrendous shift that I did just before Christmas when we ran out of CPAP, ran out of non-invasive ventilators in my hospital.  And I was thinking those patients who were getting admitted then, this was just before Christmas, they would have caught the virus a few weeks earlier at the time when we know our shopping centres were full, you know, Oxford Street was full because Boris Johnson was telling people that we're going to have a Merry Christmas.  Like, they keep making mistakes.  You know, again, I remember... Just a few weeks ago, you know, Boris Johnson, he on Sunday told parents to send their kids to school at a time when rates of the virus were soaring out of control, at a time when our hospitals were literally at breaking point.  And then kids went and mixed at school for a day before obviously having to go into lockdown.  So it's just been mistake after mistake after mistake by this government.  And they should have the integrity to apologise for their mistakes and not scapegoat the public decision.  or ethnic minorities for this just horrendous horrendous death toll that we're that we're experiencing right now.

            "text": "Yeah Yeah, at least when you see Matt Hancock lie, at least you can see there's a sort of ounce of shame when he does it.  With Priti Patel, it's just brazen.  You know, it's like she doesn't care.  I know I'm lying and I know that what's happened is terrible, but I don't really care.  And I think the most concerning thing for me is that she's essentially appealing and people are using this word a lot.  She's essentially appealing to a conspiracy theory.  oh, well, the reason why it looks particularly bad is because we record our data differently to everybody else.  Britain has the best data in the world.  If everybody was as good at collecting their data as we are, then we wouldn't look anywhere near as bad.  It's actually a success that we're recording so many deaths.  I mean, it's horrific when you think about it.  But what's most worrying about that conspiracy theory, which is what it is, is that we therefore don't have the basis by which to judge how we can do better next time.  If we aren't going to accept that we've had 1,800 deaths today, which is more than, I think, 55 times the number of deaths that Vietnam has had in the last 12 months in one day, if we're not going to accept the reality of that, then how are we going to say, well, we can learn this from those guys, or we can learn that from somewhere in the EU, or this from somewhere in Southeast Asia?  We have to have an honest appraisal of the facts to ensure this doesn't happen again.  And in the absence of that appraisal, then my worst fear is that the next time there's a pandemic, we're not going to deal with it any better.  You know, the reason why the Southeast Asian countries have dealt with this so well is because they had SARS in 2003.  And 2003, of all the countries, Vietnam was declared the first to be SARS-free by the World Health Organization.  And after that, they adopted and iterated and innovated different ways of ensuring that any future pandemic would be met with a really, really effective response.  We cannot do that if we have politicians effectively denying that we've not done any worse than other countries elsewhere.  That's what terrifies me the most. ",

I mean, Priti Patel is saying it's the fault of the immutable characteristics of the public.  But when you ask, when you go, for example, ask the general population who they most blame for the third wave, it does disappointingly come out.  sort of 70% are blaming the public and 30% are blaming the government.  And, you know, as someone who's working in a hospital who's working with medical staff every day, Do you think doctors and nurses in general have a very different perspective to the public on this?  Do you sort of encounter people in hospital who are working on the wards and who are saying, you know, this is so horrific that all of these people are dying if only the public could follow the rules?

Something I've heard quite a lot over the past couple of weeks is people getting frustrated how busy the roads are during rush hour and how busy our buses are and our trains are during rush hour.  And staff are complaining about that.  But to me, that's the government's fault.  Why is it that people are still... feel like they have to go into work and people are forced to go into work.  We know why.  that is because people have such low incomes in this country and people haven't been given the financial support to isolate.  So, you know, and actually my sister works in general practice and something that she comes across often and she gets frustrated by is that she'll come across patients who she tells them that they need to isolate.  And they tell her that they can't because they can't afford to.  That's not their fault.  That's this government's fault.  And again, the government have been told about this again and again and again, that people do not have enough financial support to isolate properly.  And again, they haven't learned from other countries, as Alan said, that if you provide people proper support, that we can get people to isolate and stop the transmission of this virus.  I think I would just, you know, reiterate what Alan's saying, that they're continuing to not learn, continuing to not learn lessons and not learn about the mistakes that they made.  So, you know, in the summer, at a time when we should have been thinking about how we can eliminate this virus and how we can secure our borders, instead we had, you know, being paid to eat out.  We also had the Telegraph putting out pages saying, telling people to go back to work.  And again, we I already hear them making the same mistakes.  Over the weekend, we saw in the newspapers government talking about how we're trying to release the restrictions at a time when rates of the virus are going up and at a time our hospitals are being overloaded.  So we just don't seem to get the message that we need to eliminate this virus.  It doesn't just affect the elderly.  It affects people of all ages.  And we know that I think we think about 10% of people will have long-term symptoms from this virus.  So they are not learning the lessons and it's infuriating.  I don't know what else we can do now at this point apart from just scream.  To me, it's quite personal to me.  This week we had a colleague of mine pass away.  I also had two members of my family pass away.  And it's just... It's just.  it's frustrating that we sort of now we're 10 months down the line and it feels like we're just having the same conversations over and over and over again.  We know what we need to do to stop this, to suppress this virus.  Other countries have done it.  And I really just wish our government could get a grip and implement the policies that we need to save people's lives. ",
