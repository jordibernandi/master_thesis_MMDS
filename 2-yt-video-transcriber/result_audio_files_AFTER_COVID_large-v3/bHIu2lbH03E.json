Trump not staying in office and Biden being sworn into office on January 20th.  This is a very big issue for Chris because he supposedly has given prophetic words straight from the mouth of God about what is to happen for this election. ",

I have to say, the mental gymnastics that he employs for these ideas should definitely win him a gold medal in the craziest shit Olympics.  If you want to know how Chris Yoon turns his failed prophecies into fulfilled prophecies, then please stay tuned.  Okay, so last time on Chris Yoon, he was predicting a lot of crazy shit.  I mean, we listened to this dream that he had where Trump was apparently in a bread van, secretly listening in on conversations that Democrats and other people were having with a servant of Satan or something like that.  And apparently that all needed to happen so that Trump could then swoop in and charge them all with treason or fraud or something.  All of this is done to keep Trump as president.  According to Chris, it had to be this way because just after the election, he kind of counted his chickens before they hatched. ",

Another thing that I don't understand is why FEMA would be in control of the government.  I simply don't understand including FEMA.  It would be a lot like including, I don't know, any other random state department that has nothing to do with taking over the government.  Now keep in mind that prior to this point, Chris was fervently saying that this is not prophetic word, and that this is just all gossip that he's heard, but it all definitely confirms his military action prophecy, and so therefore it's been fulfilled.

Otherwise, there would be an uprising and an uproar.  And so... Um, that's a smart strategy if I were to say that.  Otherwise, if you just swooped in there and took them, you know, right at the inauguration, that would obviously be not good. ",

And apparently there's evidence like in Spain or other places that it was broadcasted earlier than what it was shown live.  I can't speak to that, but these are all things that are happening in the physical world. ",

But then at the end, you speak authoritatively about it as a fact.  It kinda seems like you'll believe any kind of crazy idea out there that seems to support your failed prophecies.  Chris ends his video by stating what I can only assume is a fact to him, that the military has taken over the government and will reinstate Donald Trump at some point.

So if anything, it is a cascading effect that has actually allowed the inauguration or the proper establishment of Trump being the president again.  So we may not see it visibly, but it is a process.  So if anything, that prophetic word has come to pass or is beginning to come to pass, meaning that Trump will be in his second term.

I can only imagine that he definitely thinks the military has taken over the government and will reinstate Trump, thus fulfilling his other prophecy.  And then they will also charge, try, charge, arrest, I don't know, something to do with Biden and everybody that was against Trump and the government, along with big tech, big pharma, just everybody's going to get arrested and, I don't know, probably shot into space or something.  literally nothing will prove to this motherfucker that he is wrong.  I mean, you might as well slam your head against a brick wall because that's a lot more productive.  Sorry, I'm getting official word right now.  The lawyers want me to tell you, do not smash your face against a brick wall.  We don't care how productive you might think it might be and how productive I said it was.  Don't do it.  Well, that's it for Chris Yoon.  He's crazy as shit.  And I don't think that's going to change anytime soon.  I'm really wanting to find out at what point will he give up on this whole Trump presidency thing for the next four years?  I want to see what his line is.  So we'll probably check back in here in like a month or two, because it seems like his whole plan for arresting everybody and Trump becoming president is some weeks, if not months after.  I like how God's all powerful, but he's not powerful enough to just snap his fingers and put Trump in power.
