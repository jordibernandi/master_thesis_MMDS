And you guys, in this video coming up here, we talk a lot about alpha seeds, beta needs, or I just recently heard on a livestream, alpha slays, beta pays.  And that whole idea of men that simp, men that get used by women, they don't see the tricks and they go along with the tricks.  Those guys always get used even when they think that eventually some woman will appreciate him for all the things he's doing.  She uses those guys, she appreciates the fact that she can use those guys, and then she rewards the alphas, the Chad and Tyrones of the world, and they put very little effort in.  we see this whole idea of her using, you know, the beta mon men and then her giving herself to the alpha men, the Chad and Tyrones.  We see that situation play out in so many different arenas.  So we're going to dive into the club scene specifically, and I'm just going to break down to you how the same game plays out.  So if you are a guy that is going to these clubs and you're buying women drinks and you're, um, you're buying women gifts and you're just not getting anywhere with it.  this is just your.  this is your guilt free pass so you can watch this video and stop doing it and not feel bad because a lot of guys that are in that mindset they feel that their job is to spoil women and so they feel guilty when they stop doing it.  so so we use this video.

            "text": "is your permission to stop simping For free drinks and free entertainment, women go to clubs expecting to pay for very few, if any, of their own drinks.  Now, when I tell you guys again, right, there was a difference in my life when I would go out to clubs with my buddies.  And then later on, when I would start to go out to clubs with women and see how they prepare for the club, see how they get ready for the club, see how they talk before going to the clubs, see how they talk while they're at the club, see how they talk when they come home from the clubs.  Well, I've seen all the little tricks.  Here's one that a lot of women will do is they will, you know, they'll wear the tight, you know, dress, whatever.  They'll put their ID in their credit card in their bra or something.  And what do they have?  They have perfect plausible deniability knowing that if they have to, they could buy a drink.  But what they're really doing is they are getting the perfect plausible deniability to have just their dress and then they meet a guy.  Oh, I don't have my purse with me.  Oh, my girlfriend has my wallet.  She has all my stuff.  I don't have my money with me.  So they can get free drinks.  They know every game, guys.  They know every little game.  They know how to hide it.  I've seen girls hide their credit cards in their shoe and all different stuff to get free drinks.  Free drinks and free entertainment.  Many women make it a game to see how many free drinks they can get.  I have been around women where they will have this little game beforehand and try to basically bet each other who's going to get more free drinks that night.  Who's going to out-slut the other one to get more drinks.  I've seen it, guys.  It's not just a, oh, I've read it on the internet.  I've seen this multiple, multiple times.  That is also part of their entertainment system.  Think about women, guys.  Women live in the moment.  They live for gossip.  They live for drama.  They live for what's going on in this.  Think of Mean Girls, the movie.  They just live for this little social dynamic game.  And at the club, they get all of these tastes all met in one little arena, one little area.  So she can literally see how many simps will throw themselves at them.  And what they'll do is they will feel more empowered every time they reject another man.  So like my man Cash first asked, you know, at the beginning, you know, why do women go?  and then they just let like get guys that they twerk next to a guy and the guy tries to get up and dance on him just so they can basically shut him down.  I mean, think about it.  If you were a guy that had women just constantly like coming after you and you're just like, nah, I'm good.  Nah, I'm good.  I'm moving on.  No, you didn't make the cut.  Think how good that would fill your confidence.  That's what women get every time they do this.  Why women go when they have boyfriends?  Yeah, one, they're scouting, of course.  But two, because they get this ego boost.  They get this confidence boost just from getting guys to come up and then shutting them down.  And I see it, guys.  I see women and I know exactly how they act when they're normal.  And I see those same women and I see how they turn on their club game and how they play the game.  I see the fake laughs they put in to try to get free drinks.  I see the way they twirl their hair.  And then I see them reject guys.  It's just, it's one of those like truths that once you see it, it's just like, oh man, I can't believe people still fall for this stuff.  Yeah, if you watch Mean Girls, that's basically a majority of women.  And you know what's a funny thing about Mean Girls is in the story, right?  Lindsay Lohan, who is the good-natured, the nice girl.  Even if a girl isn't like one of these Mean Girls, what happened?  She became one of them by being influenced by them.  Oh no, I just got rid of the slides.  There it is.  Okay, so here's a third reason why she'll go.  She'll go to find Chad and Tyrone.  Chad or Tyrone.  Or both Chad and Tyrone at the same time.  Remember, dance clubs are the real life tender.  She will only swipe right.  So swipe right, right?  When you get a match.  She'll only swipe right if you are a Chad or Tyrone.  So she'll only let you dance on her if you're a Chad or Tyrone.  one of those big alpha guys or a guy with mad game, or she swipes right on you and basically puts you in, think of alpha seeds and beta needs in a micro scale.  she could swipe right on you and put you in the category of like, oh yeah, beta provider for the night.  She'll keep you around and dance on you a little bit.  If you have bottle service, if you have like a VIP access so she can get that status, she can go back to her VIP club.  if she dances on you, pretends to like it for a bit, get the perks that you're offering, or if she'll dance on you to get a guy that could potentially get her free drinks, right?  She's literally, when girls go out, it's like, Just think Alpha Seed's beta needs on a micro scale.  She will get the beta guys that she thinks she can work.  She'll dance on those guys and all that that are like seeming all into her and put them in her back pocket to know that.  later when she's walking around by the bar and she sees one of those guys she danced on, she's like, oh, okay, there's a guy.  I'm going to go cozy up to him, get a free drink real quick.  Then I'll get back to the floor.  She literally weeds guys out on who's going to be a sucker.  And then the guys that aren't suckers, the Chad and Tyrones, those are the other guys that she'll actually dance with and she'll be authentically enjoying it.  But if you're not the Chad or Tyrone, you're going to be put in this category of what can he do for me?  Does he have bottle service?  Can he bring me to VIP?  Is he going to potentially buy me drinks later?  Those are the categories you get put in.  So some guys that think it's a success because they went out... went around and danced on 10 different women and they think that's a success.  It's like, I mean, I'm not here to hate on anyone.  I don't want to knock your confidence down.  I'm good for you.  But it's kind of like the old thing when pickup artists used to go around seeing how many numbers they can get.  I don't think numbers are special at all.  Because what if it's a fake number?  What if she doesn't even care about you?  What if she's not into you?  To me, that's like a silly thing to measure.  And it's kind of the same thing here.  It's like, it's not really winning when you understand how women actually approach this club game.  And that they're really pulling the strings behind.  They're really the ones that are winning on this.  Chad doesn't buy the drinks, only the sims.  Chad does not buy the drinks, only the sims do.  In fact, Chad gets drinks bought for him.  One of the favorite moves that I've done, and this is more for giving you guys awareness, right?  I get girls that will, at some point, they will always try.  Why don't you ever take me on a date, Adam?  Why don't you ever take me out?  You know, can we go out to dinner sometime?  My whole mindset is simply this.  Go out to dinner.  Go on dates with other guys.  Let them take you to dinner and then come home later to my place when you've already gotten your dinner taken care of.  You've already gotten your fill.  That is the attitude of what Chad will have too at the club.  It's like, I'm not going to buy you a drink, but you know what?  Hey, go hit on that guy right there.  I know he's looking for some attention.  Go hit on him, get a drink from him, and then come back and dance with me.  That's exactly how a Chad would play it.  He'd get the girl and just point him out.  Go get that guy to buy you a drink and then go get him to buy me a drink too.  Say you need one from me and you need one from your girlfriends.  Go get two drinks and then come back, meet me on the dance floor.  I'll be out here dancing.  That is how a Chad plays it. ",

            "text": "now back to this statement that she uses the sims and she rewards the alphas.  have you seen this to be true as well?  have you seen this actual uh kind of situation play out in the club scene or do you just see this happen in everyday life?  what are some areas you see that in?  because again you know.  to the guys that are new to this It's going to be very helpful for them to hear real-life experiences so that when they go through their day-to-day scenarios and they see those situations, that repetition will start to help them really encompass that red pill mindset and really understanding the game and not being used by women anymore.
