            "text": "Aren't you the original prepper of survival food back in the day?  Well, thank you.  Yes, I was.  I was one of the guys that started it.  There were about four of us, and we're talking 30 years ago.  And I wanted people to understand something, that prepping is an important part.  Noah didn't listen to the doubters.  He prepped.  And if it were for Joseph preparing during the times of plenty, then the times of famine would have destroyed all of the promises of God.  That's what the devil's doing right now.  He's casting doubt into people's lives.  And let's jump to the New Testament.  The most amazing woman in the New Testament, you never hear about this, but the woman who sent her son out to hear Jesus speaking, she sent him out with loaves of bread and some fish.  Her faith by doing that fed 5,000.  And now, Lori and Armando and Marcella, we're at the point where the ability to buy storage food, it's almost gone.  It's almost gone.  There will come a time, and I believe, I want to give you a date.  It's not for the second coming of Jesus, but this is a date.  The insiders are saying July 15th is when the real shortages come.  And I don't think people understand the ramifications of the largest pork producer, Smithfield Farms, being owned by the Chinese.  That was a national security blunder.  When you understand, and I understand, and we understand, that in the land of plenty, If we're getting wearied, what happens?  As Jeremiah said, what happens if we're running with a footman and they're wearing us?  What are we going to do against the chariots?  What are we going to do against one before us, the swelling of the Jordan?  There is no way for any human, no matter how strong they think they are, to deal with what's coming with the time.  And most people have a context like this.  They have a framework of what they expect, what they've been taught, and what they're comfortable with.  I'm telling you, the times are coming in.  now is going to be not the distance between your finger and your index finger and your thumb, but it's going to be out of the context of your control, your ability to even rationally think it, because Jesus said, there's never been anything like it, any time like it, nor would be again, and except the days be short, and for the elect's sake, there'd be no flesh left alive.  And now we have this situation where Everything that we could have prepared with is being taken away from us.  And by the way, you guys, when I started on talk radio 25 years ago with my own program, I was writing survival newsletters almost 10 years before that.  The thing that was prominent I remember the second, I think, or third program I ever did is when the Lord said the two most precious commodities at the end of the age before my coming will be fresh water, potable water and something to eat.  And then he said an interesting thing.  And he said, you will walk through puddles of water in the future that you once would have never thought you would drink.  And so I'm not kidding.  I want everybody that's listening to me.  Watch your attitude change when you start.  Take a glass of water.  Every time you take a glass of water and say, thank you, Jesus.  Thank you for this clean water.  Every time you go out and look at the sky.  Say, Lord, I love your blue sky.  And I think that's really important that we develop a more prominent attitude of gratitude because we've taken everything for granted.  And now everything we've taken for granted is going to be taken away from us.  People still look for a political solution to a spiritual problem.  And that's the mess we're in.  Pulpits still look for the praise of men rather than the praise of God.  It's no wonder.  And this is interesting.  you guys, is that I had a statement years and years ago, and it so fits today even for this broadcast.  No word of God spoken by a man of God or a woman of God is ever received by the people of God at the time it's spoken.  That should send shockwaves through people.  And people say, well, that's just not true.  No, if it were true, people would have not let this country come to where it's at.  We wouldn't have allowed, you know, 100 million abortions.  By the way, I say this to everybody who's ever had one.  Jesus loves you.  Your children love you.  They're in heaven.  They've forgiven you.  You need to forgive yourself.  But that blood... of the innocents is what's greased the wheels of those who derive power because there's life in the blood.  You see, here's the deal.  Jesus didn't walk into sanitary conditions and preach to people that were righteous.  He said, they that are whole have no need of a physician.  But he was sent to the sick.  There's a sickness in the land and it's called sin.  And everything that people do to try and assuage whatever uncomfortable issues they're having in their life, they're being taken away.  Can you imagine all the people on all of the different mood enhancers and the SSRIs, if you will, all the different drugs?  And it's interesting because, and I'm sorry that the president did this, but he appointed one of the most, in my opinion, one of the most well-placed drug pharmaceutical kingpins.  And you know, you guys, we go to the book of Revelation, and it's talking about Mystery Babylon.  Its judgment comes in one hour, and they didn't repent of their sorceries and witchcraft, which the Greek word is pharmakia or pharmakia.  So it's interesting.  We're seeing the headlines that Revelation declared to John, the servant of God.  And I want to make this clear, too.  Everybody will quote Revelation, but it's not just the book of Revelation.  It's the revelation of Jesus Christ, which God the Father gave to his servant John the Apostle on the island of Patmos.  And I think that's critical because the testimony of Jesus is a spirit of prophecy.  And without the true spirit of prophecy, people are left in the dark.  The number one, I said this so many times, but the number one survival item is your brain in contact with your heart, in contact with your word.  In other words, if people can't prepare under the best of times, they will be destroyed during the worst of times.  We are in those times.  They're not fixing to happen.  They're not coming in the future.  It's coming upon us now. ",
