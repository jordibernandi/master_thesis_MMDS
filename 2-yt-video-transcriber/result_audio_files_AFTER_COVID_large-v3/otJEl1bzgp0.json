            "text": "Welcome back.  You're here with Goldberg.  Today I want to talk about, I was actually going to bring up Ronald Reagan's legacy, but then I figured out this is a little bit more temporal, I suppose.  And so we have to look at this question of your enslavement and the reason why you're probably going to remain a slave.  There is of course a real social dynamic to it.  Someone should page Todd Virgin for help.  No, I'm just kidding.  And then there's the financial aspect.  And people go, no, Martin, you can only focus on one subject because everyone has to just have their own little specialization.  You can go screw yourself, to be perfectly honest.  And I do that with love, right?  Like from Russia.  That is the telltale sign.  When someone talks about how, oh, I only read, you know, vampire fiction or whatever it might be, or I only do the gym, it's a great indication of the fact that they are a perfect drone, pinion, bolt, or nut, although they don't have many of the latter, for the system.  They don't tend to question anything.  They just get plugged into their Netflix and they begin not to chill, but actually to melt.  uh, cerebrally.  I believe that you should not go by how society perceives you and decides.  this is how you have to be.  Otherwise I would have ended up dating a bunch of land whales as opposed to attractive women.  Uh, I wouldn't have written books if I had that mentality.  I think that you have to always say, what do you want as opposed to what does society decide?  And in that sense, we can look at how the social sphere keeps a lot of people plugged in.  So about a year ago, people were telling me, hey, you should make Instagram.  It's good for networking and all that dynamic stuff, meeting people.  So I created one.  I put up some different posts.  I didn't take it too seriously.  But in the mix of being on Instagram, I saw this page of this chick, Yasmin Delina, who I think is attractive.  She's kind of like the ideal ad mixture for a woman, as far as I'm concerned.  Now, maybe she's plastic, maybe she's got implants.  I'm not into that sort of thing, but I'm just saying, if she is real, it's pretty decent.  It's kind of like, you know, that's no moon, that's a Dominican booty.  Okay.  Well, most of her content, as you might imagine, it's her in yoga pants sitting on a counter or doing squats on a video, that sort of thing, right?  All right, we know that exists.  But what I found is that after I followed her, sort of like you get those ads about car insurance that magically include your hometown, All these pages were popping up of these chicks, same thing, yoga pants, doing squats, their fitness channel, so-called.  And you're going, you know, again, it's a nice drug.  A lot of the dudes who follow these channels probably aren't going to date those women or anything comparable.  But it keeps them thinking, oh, yeah, it's okay, you know, oh, yeah.  you know, I'll be able to find a woman one day.  I can now, for the time being, I'll take all my love and all my emotion and I'll apply it in praise to this particular figure, right?  And they've got hundreds of thousands, if not millions of followers.  And okay, just to be perfectly clear, it's sort of like pornography in a way.  The danger of pornography, besides the fact that it can desensitize you to certain things, is that it has the effect of, in some cases, it prevents men from even trying in real life, like decent looking guys, because pornography becomes the safe haven, the excuse, the reason why you don't have to look at yourself and say, okay, this could actually in a positive manner, it could influence me in a good way.  Now, to be clear with these pages, I know that there are some instances where I think dudes do it.  I saw a couple episodes of that catfish show.  There was some guy, like a Chadrone-ish looking dude, All his content was oriented towards gay men.  So he had all these girlish pictures in tight clothes and such.  And then he ended up getting catfished by a gay guy with a picture of a girl he actually found attractive.  So you never know, but I think it's more widespread on the other side of things.  And even in dating apps, it's a similar dynamic.  Because typically when you download a dating app, your Tinder, your Bumble... you have that first rush where you get a decent amount of some matches, some activity or whatnot, and then it tapers off a little bit.  Well, after five days or a week or so where you don't have that much going on, a lot of people say, OK, screw it, now delete the thing.  However, you notice how magically that's when you get a like or two and you try to expand the boundaries, you expand the distance kind of like you would, you know, spread the seas in order to make more room.  And of course, depending on who you're dating, there's a lot of room there.  Well, at any rate, you do that and you're not actually hitting or matching with them.  And it's because that's done to reel you back in.  Again, it's the same drug.  No, no, no, no, just a little while longer and you're going to get who you want.  You're going to find the magical plus one.  And that's because they don't make money off of women.  They make money off of the men.  The men are the ones who are going to bother spending money on gold, on the premium stuff.  on being able to get to that level, it's kind of like with nightclubs.  Oftentimes women don't pay to get in because they need you plugged into that system so you're not paying attention to everything else.  that is wrong.  And that's how these very bizarre business structures operate.  Years ago, this German Colonel Sanders with a big bushy beard said that religion is the opium of the masses.  And to whatever degree you could criticize organized religion at the time, it's kind of a joke to say it nowadays because the government and the media and technology have a lot more power and influence over people's minds than a church.  Even the authoritarian regimes of the 1930s couldn't get close to what these liberal democratic republics have been able to achieve with surveillance and tracking and modern militarization of security forces.  So there's all those things to consider.  So in that sense, you will remain a slave because you'll be plugged into those machines.  But then on the financial side, there's this article on Yahoo, the great wealth transfer means for the economy from March of 2020.  Someone sent to me, they're saying that boomers control like 15 trillion or as much as 68 trillion worth of assets and they're starting to get older.  they're passing that money on to millennials or maybe even zoomers.  excuse me now that might sound like a great thing but of course there's a lot of different dynamics that these articles are not effectively getting at and so let's just consider this.  there was the whole legislation some trump signed last year i think which redid the rules on inheritance of retirement accounts, which makes it very hard to, on an intergenerational basis, pass money without being hit by taxes, especially if you're trying to avoid taxes in the short term once the money is passed down.  We have the fact that there are very low interest rates, which, yeah, that could be good if you're trying to buy property, but of course there's different effects with it.  You can't really save effectively, so that's one problem.  If your boomer parents or grandparents, if their stocks go down because of all this stuff, they don't have fixed income, low interest rates, you might end up having to support them, or the government does, and the government, for instance, spends more money.  How does that exactly add up in good favor?  They say, well, invest in your 401k in the stock market.  True, you can make money on the stock market, but the stock market has gotten so accustomed to bailouts and Fed policy in its favor that it gets jittery whenever there's a chance of either not lowering the interest rate more or raising it a fraction.  They all freak out.  They start selling off.  They've become accustomed to getting financial grants from the government if they can't do their job, if they screw up.  So they're going to become more reckless, again, because they have no risk of actually falling apart.  So you end up shouldering that, not even counting all the spending bills that Trump did.  You have the, uh, the tax cut, of course, that deprived government of revenue.  So that's one factor.  You also have the, um, the coronavirus response.  I think in total it was 6.4 or 6.6 trillion when you included the Fed program.  People say, oh yeah, but inflation doesn't matter.  I remember this was in college.  I was doing a microeconomics class.  And at the beginning, this liberal cuck professor who was old and to Paul Krugman, he told us, oh, I want you to tell me what the interest rate is.  and the inflation rate, I'm sorry, people were throwing out these government-approved numbers, and I challenged him on that, and he got all kind of triggered.  I say he's a liberal cuck because I saw him years later, and he was married to a land whale.  I'm not saying that makes him a bad person.  It just means he married a land whale, okay?  So you get the logic.  But the thing is, of course, inflation is much higher than that.  You can't trust the government.  Look at the price of education.  Look at the price of houses of automobiles, of consumer goods.  There's no question that there is price and purchasing power inflation, and anyone who tells you it doesn't exist is probably a politician who's working for the government.  That matters because they're trying to spend even more.  Trump said, I think, a trillion or a trillion and a half for infrastructure.  The Democrats want two trillion.  That's all money.  Again, that's going to impact the value of currency.  And how long can it go on?  How long can you keep propping up the stock market?  A lot of people lost their jobs during the pandemic.  So that's even less time they have to put aside money towards their future.  And then of course, these boomers, unless you decide to take care of your parents, you kind of do a, you know, you let them move into your house or whatever, or you move into theirs.  If you're not willing to do that and they go to an assisted living home, those things are ridiculous.  You're talking about like nine grand a month, if not more, and oftentimes they try to get you to sign over the assets of the parents.  You got to be careful with that because then you will end up losing your inheritance to a retirement home.  It's a massive scheme and there's been a lot of lawsuits over that, but of course the law tends to be on their side.  So these aspects, they all come together, right?  You very likely will be working a lot of your life just trying to get by.  And if the government comes in and says, okay, there's this wealth transfer.  We're just going to tax it higher because we're running out of money.  We can only print so much.  You're going to get screwed there.  You know that, of course, the boomers, the senior class is not going to vote for entitlement reform anytime soon.  So there's that.  You have the state and local run pensions, which are on the verge of collapse.  They said the same thing about the postal service, although I've heard that's also not true.  It depends how you weigh things there.  You have the possibility of war, if not between us and China, then China and India, which could disrupt and send the markets down for a long period of time.  you have an encroaching government into the cryptocurrency space.  And of course, a lot of cryptocurrencies that are scams, some of them are more legitimate, others are just essentially sheer speculation.  And you never know if the government's going to try to come after gold and silver.  That'll be the interesting dynamic to witness.  The point is, if you're not very good at managing your money and putting it into assets that work and, of course, delimiting your own costs, trying to avoid throwing out your inheritance and even your own income to take care of your parents, which hopefully you're going to take care of your parents in some sense.  you could very well end up, if not on the social side where you're a drone, you can end up on the financial side, a debt slave.  A lot of you might already be if you've gone to college because you wanted an art history degree, which I'm not attacking art history, just saying you could be in a lot of debt.  So your choices matter.  And the way that you think about the world, the way that you, how you spend your time also matters.  People, someone said to me the other day, they're like, Dr.  Goldberg, why don't you run for president?  I think I would be unelectable.  And the reason is that most folks, let's be real, you probably don't read for pleasure.  I just put my foot in my mouth because now you're all going to start waving your copies of Fifty Shades.  But most people don't read history and economics and finance because they want to.  And when they see a person who makes sense, like Ron Paul 2008 or 2012, Mike Rebell, Rand Paul, others, what is their reaction?  They tend to look at that person with suspicion.  Oh, they're boring.  They're not interesting.  I want someone who's fist pounding, you know, let's keep printing money.  Who cares?  We're the greatest country on earth, even if we have all these myriad of problems, even if our foreign policy makes no sense.  Even if our families are falling apart.  We have tons of homeless.  We have veterans that are essentially left to die.  We have kids that are being indoctrinated in schools.  But it doesn't matter because we're the greatest country on earth.  That is really a question of how much of a slave you happen to be.  If you listen to someone like Trump, not saying I oppose everything, but Trump is a guy who got elected.  He doesn't have a moral code.  He's a liar, like a lot of other politicians are.  But he does the parade and he talks about America's not going to be socialist.  We're the greatest country on earth.  We worship God.  And there are people who believe that.  Even with everything else going on, they believe that.  So if you want to stop being a slave, you have to pay attention to more than what you want to feel.  You have to stop listening to self-help gurus who talk about having a positive attitude no matter what, and you have to look at, wait a second, what is actually occurring?  And how do I have to react to ensure that I don't spend the rest of my life in chains?  Not necessarily because you don't want to be, because a lot of these folks, frankly, they will joyfully snap on the bat cuffs, Robin, and they'll say, it's all good, it's all fine, I'm doing great.  you have to break free from those shackles.
