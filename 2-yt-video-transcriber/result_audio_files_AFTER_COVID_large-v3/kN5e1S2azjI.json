            "text": "The most intriguing claim here is that the moral argument exposes atheism as self-contradictory, and I'll respond to this in detail in just a moment.  First, however, I'd like to address Eric's framing, and then the notion that atheism is outright appalling.  The most obvious flaw of the dichotomy that Eric presents is, of course, that it's a false dichotomy, a black and white fallacy.  Without justification, he asserts that the moral argument exposes atheism as either self-contradictory or outright appalling.  outright appalling.  Now since he's the one claiming that there are only two possibilities, the onus is on him to rule out all other possibilities, and he doesn't even attempt to do this.  But for what it's worth, here's just two off the top of my head.  One, there are plenty of religious people who don't believe in a god, such as Buddhists, who nevertheless believe in a supernatural objective morality.  It pays to remember that an atheist is merely someone who isn't convinced that at least one god exists.  That's it.  They can, and in many cases do, believe in all sorts of supernatural propositions.  And two, there are plenty of non-religious atheists, such as myself, that believe in a non-religious objective moral framework.  Yes, we use the scientific definition of objective as opposed to a transcendent jurisprudence, but to assert that an objective moral framework necessitates transcendent jurisprudence is to beg the question.  It is to have a premise that assumes the conclusion.  But putting this false dichotomy aside, let's assume the moral relativistic perspective and say that atheists have no moral objective framework whatsoever, and that consequently, atheism is outright appalling.  In such a case, the most succinct response is as follows.  So?  Get over it, Christflake.  Countless facts are appalling, such as babies suffering from cancer, abject poverty, and there being such a thing as a PhD in theology.  Our condemnation has no bearing whatsoever on whether or not a proposition is factually true.  Hell, evolution by natural selection, a proposition that underpins countless fields of study, is brutally appalling.  As Thomas Hobbes put it, \"...in the state of nature, life is nasty, brutish, and short.  The way in which a species adapts to, say, a deadly disease is through the annihilation of all those without resistance.  If that isn't outright appalling, then I don't know what is.  But it's  true.\".  Okay, so with the appalling half of Eric's dichotomy dispensed with, let's move on to the claim that atheism is self-contradictory. ",

            "text": "the reason that he and many other theists assert that the moral argument exposes atheism as self-contradictory or outright appalling is because they define objective morality as necessarily divine.  Or to put it another way, since atheism is merely the state of not being convinced of the existence of gods, the theist has to be defining objective morality as cosmic laws in order to assert that atheism is self-contradictory.  As I've stated before, this is one of the biggest issues with proponents of the moral argument, and yet for whatever reason the crucial definition of objective morality tends to fall under the radar, and this leads to a lot of talking past one another.  So, in conclusion, I'd like to humbly offer one tip in dealing with this issue, and it's simple.  Ask the theist to define objective morality.  If they define it in such a way as to be celestial jurisprudence, then the second premise is unsubstantiated, and if you want to go further, you can gently explain to them that their second premise is begging the question, since the conclusion, a transcendent judge, is baked into the premise, transcendent edicts.  And if they do not define objective morality in such terms, then their first premise is false, and the argument falls apart.  Anyhow, I'm going to leave you with a B.E.A.utiful quote from Christopher Hitchens on morality.  But before doing so, I'd like to sign off myself by saying thank you kindly for the view and an extra special thank you to my wonderful patrons and those of you who have supported the channel via other means.
