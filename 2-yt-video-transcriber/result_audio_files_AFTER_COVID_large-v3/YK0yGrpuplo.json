And when you look forward at the kinds of AI we're going to be creating in the next decades, I think it's important to see how broad the scope of possible AI minds is going to be.  So we're really at a unique position in human history now, one that I think Nietzsche vaguely foresaw and Wagner did not foresee from what I know of.  We're at a point where we're really on the verge of being able to create minds and beings that go... very far beyond humanity, as far, let's say, as we are beyond chimpanzees or cockroaches or even one-celled organisms.
