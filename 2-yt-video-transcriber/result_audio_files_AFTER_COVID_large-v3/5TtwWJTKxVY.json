            "text": "What's going on?  This is my life in a shot.  I'm your host, Donald Washington.  I want to bring you guys a story out of Florida where a mother gets shot at her own son's funeral.  She did live, but something else is going on.  Somebody just don't shoot somebody at a damn funeral.  All right, so look, her son was 18 years old since 7 p.m.  18, got killed by the cops.  Another young brother that was just a passenger, name was Anthony A.J.  Crooms, only 16.  There was a third person in the car.  They did recover two weapons out of the car.  All right, I'm going to bring y'all that video.  I'm also bringing y'all.  the cop that did the shooting, had a history of domestic.  Dude was a loose cannon already.  And there's records of somebody with the same name.  And a lot of people think that's the same cop.  Ben Crump went out there to protest these kids getting killed.  And let me tell y'all something.  You know, I watched the video and it looked like a justified shooting.  I'm about to show y'all that now.  Let me show y'all the video of the killing.  Let me rewind it.  This is it here.  They're going to pull them over because they're talking about, oh, we thought the car was stolen.  It wasn't.  But we know that that's just a... an excuse to pull over young black kids driving in the car.  And that happened to me a thousand times.  Every time cops see me, whoop!  License and registration.  However, man, you do not hold court in the street.  There's no winning.  So, was this a justified shooting?  I'm gonna have to say it is, because you're gonna see the young brother drove towards the cop.  Now the cop gonna come in to the left.  Now he's going to stop.  He's going to back up.  And his cop is yelling at him to stop.  Let me bring the audio in.  Stop the vehicle.  Stop the vehicle.  Stop the vehicle.  Stop.  10-33.  Stop the vehicle, god damn it.  Stop.  Stop.  So now, was it a justified shooting?  It looked like it was.  I'm not one of those that cry racism for everything.  I'm not that.  If it's justified shooting, I'm going to call it a justified shooting.  If it's an unjustified shooting, I'm going to call it an unjustified shooting.  However, the young brother drove towards the cop, pulled his wheel.  The young brother had a little avenue to get away, which he should have took.  But he drove towards the cop.  The cop is going to kill him every time, man.  And he got the other young brother killed as well.  16-year-old.  that had nothing to do with it, man.  even though the car was not stolen.  Hey, man, I'd be bogus if I tell y'all when the cop told y'all something to defy their order to act a damn fool.  Man, it's no justice.  Do what they say in that moment.  If they bogus, like my father used to say, you sit your happy ass down and listen to whatever they say.  If the cop is bogus, I'm going to go up there and I'm going to deal with it.  I'm going to deal with it.  And if he's going to shoot somebody, it's going to be me.  he shoots.  Not you.  You gonna live to come home.  I handle him, you sit your happy ass down.  You tell me what happened, be truthful, and I go take care of it.  And if it's unjust, then we gonna take care of it.  If it's justified, you bogus, then you bogus.  So the mother, that's the mother right there.  Sometimes, I'm telling you, sometimes these hood mothers be older than the kids.  Quasheeda Pierce was her name, is her name.  She is living, all right?  She did live.  Where in the entire fudge is Coca, Florida?  It looked like it's south, no, no, I'm sorry.  East of Orlando.  East of Orlando.  But look, so y'all look, check it.  Let me show y'all the cop.  Let me show y'all the cop.  This is the cop right here.  This punk got domestics, but I don't know if this is the exact, I'm gonna read y'all the story of the cop in a hot minute.  But this is the same name.  All right, so wait a minute, let me see, hold on, hold on.  Look.  So look, deputy involved in a fatal shooting has a history of violence, unacceptable behavior, record show.  All right?  Check it.  A Brevard County deputy involved in a deli shoot at two teens in Coca-Flu last week has a history of domestic and behavior deemed unacceptable for a deputy sheriff.  The sheriff's office released the personal files of the deputy, Jav Santiago Miranda, who is Hispanic.  Dash cam video also released shows.  at the moment at least two deputies fired on killing an 18-year-old and a 16-year-old, according to the documents released.  He was only suspended rather than terminated for unacceptable behavior because commanding officers spoke highly of his performance.  He was placed on administrative leave in office in April after his wife called the sheriff's office and told my husband threatened another man she'd been seeing.  Ooh, his wife is out creeping.  Uh-oh.  According to report, the cop told his wife told his wife that the man who was also an officer, damn dude, she was messing with another officer, needs to wear a bulletproof vest and that he was going to get his shotgun right now.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  She was creeping with another cop.  You low-down dirty mother... Alright, when questioned about it, Santiago making a statement about the vest but didn't... Now, he said he denied making a statement about the vest, but admitted to the shotgun comment saying it was taken out of context.  Hey, you know, hey, you know, I'm messing with another damn cop.  Told dude, you better wear a vest.  He's about to get his shotgun.  I also say the video in the incident showed their daughter crying and telling her father to let the mother go.  So there's a video of dude domestically Beating his wife, the state's attorney office declined to file charges of domestic battery and child neglect in connection with the incident.  See, the cops covered for each other.  The wife filed a police report and the cops didn't charge him.  Santiago was brought on duty.  320 hours of suspension without pay.  See, they covered for each other.  Covered for him.  See that?  But this is the same name, who?  Felony.  See this can't be due because ain't no way it could be a cop with burglary and felonies on your record.  But then there's, there's documents.  See.  See look.  That's the same name, that's the same.  So, and it also has, nah.  Yeah, see, that can't be dude.  That's the same name.  I don't think that's the same record.  I got this, I got that statement and that story.  Let me show y'all.  See, look.  That's dude, deputy in coca shooting, has felony gun charges, burglary and domestic violence with children.  See, look.  That's all that, that's the criminal records.  Okay, cop.  See how cops stick up for each other?  Made that domestic disappear.  But now it's coming back to bite him because now the man had killed somebody.  So the mother gets shot at her son's funeral.  Something ain't adding up.  Somebody was into something they wasn't supposed to be.  Somebody was doing something.  Ain't nobody just going to sit at a funeral after she didn't place the flowers down and somebody just blast her.  Somebody ain't saying something.  Something going on.  Something going on.  The mother was into something.  I refuse to believe that she was just an innocent person there, and they just sitting there, and somebody just blast her.  Something ain't adding up.  Unfortunate, but some of these mothers, man, be harder than the kids, man.  Look at them.  Kogisha, Kushida, whatever her name is.  Anyway, I wanted to bring y'all the story.  It's crazy.  Bananas, man.  You know, unfortunately, the 16-year-old was killed.  And so they're saying guns was found in the car.  And the third person is saying that they did hear the cop saying, stop, stop.  And the young brother did drive it to the cop.  I can't defend that, man.  You know, if it's bogus, if it's unjustified, then I'm going to call it just that.
