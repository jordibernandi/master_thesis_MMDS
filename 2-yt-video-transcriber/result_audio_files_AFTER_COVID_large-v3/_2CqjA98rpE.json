The plane itself can cost anything from 3 million dollars to 90 million dollars, but there are also costs that come with it, maintenance, fuel, the pilot's salary, and hangar fees, just to name a few.  Just to start off, a pilot would cost $250,000 annually, hangar fees can amount to $200,000, and filling a fuel tank costs upwards of $50,000.  Replacing a windshield, just a windshield, can cost easily as $60,000.  With that in mind, it's pretty clear to see that these limousines in the sky cost more than a pretty penny.  Still, just how expensive can they actually get?  Welcome back to global luxury and today that is exactly what we'll be looking at as we go through the most expensive private jets owned by millionaires.  You can expect some incredibly rich and famous names in this video as well as a hard to believe fact about a certain celebrity who parks his planes at his own residence, so stay tuned for that.  Before we get started, make sure you hit the like and subscribe button.  Done?  Then let's get ready to take off.  Let's start off with one of the best selling jets of all time, the Gulfstream IV.  This industry favorite can fly at a maximum altitude of 45,000 feet and hit speeds of 935 kilometers per hour, courtesy of two Rolls-Royce Tay MK6118 turbofans.  The jet comes in different variations suited for different purposes.  For instance, some models are optimized for cargo, while others are designed for military purposes.  In fact, the governments of Brunei, Chile, Egypt, Botswana, Ivory Coast, Japan, Malaysia, Netherlands, Saudi Arabia are just a few names of the exclusive clientele that uses the Gulfstream IV for government and military transportation.  Needless to say, the Gulfstream IV is quite expensive.  In order to own it, you would need to feature in countless classic action films, win several awards, and be a prominent advocate of the Church of Scientology.  In other words, you would have to be Tom Cruise.  Yes, Tom Cruise owns a Gulfstream IV, with the investment costing him $35 million.  And the expenses don't end there.  With a flying schedule of 200 hours a year, the annual cost of owning this plane is approximately $1.4 million.  Nevertheless, there's a reason that this jet has been selling well since 1985.  Despite the exorbitant cost, it is incredibly versatile and reliable, making it well worth the money.  Gulfstream, the company responsible for designing and building the Gulfstream IV, pride themselves on high standards of aircraft that they produce.  Because of this, it should come as no surprise that the Gulfstream IV was then succeeded by the Gulfstream V. The Gulfstream V surpasses the Gulfstream IV in various ways.  It can fly up to 51,000 feet, achieve speeds of up to 941 kilometers per hour, and boast better performance due to an engine upgrade.  Because of these specs, the Gulfstream V is lauded as an ultra-long range jet.  So how much does it cost?  Well different variations will once again cost different prices, but one of our favorite people on earth, star of hit comedies such as Dumb and Dumber and The Mask, Jim Carrey owns one and it cost him $59 million, a price tag that sits significantly higher than Tom Cruise's Gulfstream 4.

The G650ER was launched in 2009 and was greatly renowned for its speed.  In fact, the aircraft won the Collier Trophy in 2014 for having improved business aviation through significant technological advancements in aircraft performance cabin comfort and safety.

It comes as no surprise that Cristiano Ronaldo owns one and of course, he can easily afford it, even with an estimated price sitting between $45 million and $67 million.  As previously mentioned, the G650 is no longer Gulfstream's pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance, as that title now belongs to the G700, the world's largest private jet, which costs a whopping 75 million dollars.  The G700 can seat up to 19 passengers and sleeps up to 10, not to mention it comes with a six-seat dining room that can be turned into a conference space for convenience.  The plane also takes a swipe at reducing jet lag through its lighting system, which can replicate sunrise and sunset for a more comfortable post-flight experience.  The luxury does not end there though.  There is also the option to supplement the master suite with a spa shower, two windows, and a wardrobe closet for the ultimate flying experience with a top speed of 1,111 kilometers per hour, which is quite close to the speed of sound.

The Bombardier BD700 is known for its luxuries as its spacious cabins can accommodate between 12 to 16 passengers for conferencing and meetings.  The Bombardier BD-700 is also used by militaries around the world as the UK's Royal Air Force famously uses it for surveillance, which goes to show just how reliable they are.  Funny enough, Celine Dion is also a proud owner of these planes.  Complete with several bathrooms and a full kitchen, it apparently cost her 42 million dollars, but at least she can be rest assured that even the military trusts their lives.  with this plane.  Moving on from reliability to aesthetics, what would you go for if the most important aspect of your purchase was the interior design of your private jet?  Well, chances are you would turn to the Embraer Lineage 1000E, a glorious $53 million jet.  There is approximately 800 square feet of living space in this plane and on top of that, clients have thousands of options to pick from in terms of leathers, wools, and silks for the five interior zones which cater to several needs including fine dining, conferences, relaxation, or entertainment.  This came as a result of thousands of hours of market research that the company has put into catering to high-end clients, however, What is most impressive about this aircraft is the sense of space.  Despite the aircraft being smaller than many of its competitors, its smart design ensures that it is also able to land in a wide selection of airports.  Speaking of owning planes, John Travolta owns not one but five private planes, with the crown jewel being a Boeing 707-138.  He acquired it in 1998 but waited three years for the price to drop just so he could afford it.  Still, just how much did it cost him?  Well, the price was never disclosed, but it is worth noting that only 13 of such planes were ever produced.  In fact, in 2019, Travolta donated his jet to an aviation museum in Australia.  And if this plane is museum worthy, it may well be the most expensive private jet on this list.  Such purchases are actually rare for millionaires as it is usually only billionaires that can afford such transport.  Donald Trump has a Boeing 727-23.  Roman Abramovich, famous owner of Chelsea Football Club, owns a Boeing 767-33A nicknamed the Bandit and the Sultan of Brunei owns a Boeing 747-430. with an astounding price tag of $220 million.  Even so, as a world-famous multi-millionaire, it is understandable that Travolta could afford his Boeing.  In fact, given his love for aircraft, it is equally as understandable that his home doubles as a functional airport, which means he can park his planes right outside his front door.  That's right, our mystery celebrity who basically lives in an airport is none other than John Travolta.  guess that means he can pick up a royale with cheese whenever he feels like it.  and that's it for the video today.  guys we hope you have all enjoyed it.  as you can see there are actually a lot of jets out there that many multi-millionaires are happy to invest in despite the fact that they are to many of us the ultimate sign of luxury.
