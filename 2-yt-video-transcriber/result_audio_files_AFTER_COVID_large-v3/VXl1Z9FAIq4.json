And what I found very fascinating is that the more I date women, the more I find myself understanding men.  Let me explain.  Exhibit A. I was on a first date with a girl who asked me out, by the way.  This is relevant.  Because when the check came, she never once made a move to pay.  Not even like the fake, let me reach for my purse move.  And though I don't mind paying on a date, part of me felt like, you know, the offer would have been nice.  I was also a little taken aback that she didn't even say thank you.  And I never heard from her again.  It really made me feel like she just asked me out so she could have a free dinner.  And the moment I thought that, I was like, oh my god, I sound like all of my guy friends right now.  And my argument against why guys should pay for dates has always been like, Look, girls take hours to get ready.  Our investment is looking really nice for you.  Makeup, clothes, that costs money too.  But we were both girls in this situation.  We both took hours to get ready.  So I definitely felt slighted. ",

Oh, I understand that, you know, your viewpoint as women were being dismissed for years and years and years and years.  But the solution to that is not the opposite.  Example, the solution to racism is not more racism.  The solution to sexism is not sexism.  The resolution from you being dismissed is not you dismissing other people.
