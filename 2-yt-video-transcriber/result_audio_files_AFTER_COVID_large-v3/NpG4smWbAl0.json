So you said something this weekend, if I may quote, \"...Supreme Court in tossing Texas lawsuit that was joined by 17 states, 106 U.S.  congressmen, has decreed the state can take an unconstitutional action and violate its own election law, resulting in damaging effects on the other states that abide by the law while the guilty state suffers no  consequence.\".  This decision establishes as a precedent that says states can violate the U.S.  Constitution and not be held accountable.  This decision will have far reaching ramifications for the future of our constitutional republic.  Perhaps law abiding states should bond together and form a union of states that will abide by the Constitution.  I'm for that.  I'd like to know what you mean by that. ",

The bottom line is that how will states be able to protect themselves if, by our Constitution, if states have a grievance and they do have a First Amendment right to petition their government for redress or grievance, if they have a grievance against another state, The original jurisdiction of that by the Constitution goes to the Supreme Court.  But yet the Supreme Court just said in their decision last week, Friday.  that they're not going to hear it.  They toss it out.  So how do we make sure that states who are following the law and they are receiving damages because of states that did illegal activities, unconstitutional actions, violating their own election law by having courts, by having secretaries of state, by having governors change election law, where do they go to redress their grievances?  And so I think it is very important, very imperative that we do start looking at how these states If we're going to have a more perfect union, which is what the preamble of the Constitution said, and abide by the Constitution, they have to look at how they combine together and have a strong voice if the Supreme Court is going to continue to take this stance of not protecting law-abiding states, which under the 14th Amendment, there is an equal protection under the law clause.

I think that was a massive mistake, especially when half the country feels like nobody's listening to us.  Nobody's even listening to us.  Um, they should have listened, whether that changed the outcome or not, it should have been ruled on.  However, the one thing that was ruled on, uh, was the, the case itself.  They threw it out and even Scalia, uh, Barrett, uh, and not Scalia, but, uh, why do we keep screwing him up with Alito, Alito and, uh, and Thomas agreed with not hearing it.  What does that tell you?  If anything? ",

Now, if all of a sudden we have justices that decide that they're not going to interpret the law, they have actually abdicated justice.  one of their enumerated duties and responsibilities.  So they should have at least heard the case, should have allowed the evidence to come forward and make a decision on it and not just simply say, we're not going to accept the case.  And so therefore it comes back to my statement.  What protection do law abiding states have against states that are going out there and violating the the Constitution, and violating law.  You cannot have states that all of a sudden decide, well, we're going to have this universal mail-in ballot thing.  You don't have to have signature verifications.  We'll accept these ballots any time after the November the 3rd election.  And look at what has happened in New York.  Claudia Tenney is supposedly up by 12 ballots, and then guess what happens?  Oh, we found 12 ballots.  So if you want to talk about disenfranchising legal voters, it's these unconstitutional acts that are doing it.  But like you just said, where do people go?  Where do states go to have their voices heard?  The right to petition their government for redress of grievances.  That is the foundation.  of our Declaration of Independence that Thomas Jefferson wrote. ",

I see this as a fracture to our constitutional republic.  So it's not just the state attorney generals.  It's also the state legislators.  If you are a state legislator in Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan or Wisconsin, You need to rise up.  You need to stand up and say that we cannot allow the judicial branch in our state or the executive branch in our state to supersede and to usurp our duties and our responsibilities.  They cannot change law.  We're the ones that have been duly elected by the people to do such.  So I think another thing that needs to happen is state legislatures need to bond together, and I would hope \u2013 that the state legislatures in these respective four states, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan, and Wisconsin, will take an action and take a stand today.

The rest is in the hands of God.  And what he meant by that was do the right thing.  We haven't come this far to screw it up.  Just do the right thing and it will be repairable in the future because they'll see that we tried to do the right thing and they'll want to do the right thing.

Establish justice.  So what our founding fathers knew was that in order to have a more perfect union, we had to have a constitution.  We had to have a rule of law.  If we have gotten to the point where we don't believe in that rule of law, we're not going to have a more perfect union.  And that's why I talked about a union, the words that they use, of law-abiding states that abide by the constitution.  That's how we have a perfect union.  And you're right.  Leaders, what I learned in the military, leaders know what right looks like.  And leaders don't pick and choose when to do what is right, which comes back to what the Supreme Court did last Friday.  You do what is right all the time.  You interpret the law.  That is your responsibility by the Constitution.  And now states have to be concerned.  Where do we go?  to redress our grievances if the highest court in the land, which by original jurisdiction, that's the only court we could go to, decided to not listen to us. ",

We cannot have progressive socialists that believe that they can rule by absolutism and totalitarianism and everything that doesn't agree with them is illegitimate.  So I think that first and foremost, the American people need to go by the electoral process, the ballot process.
