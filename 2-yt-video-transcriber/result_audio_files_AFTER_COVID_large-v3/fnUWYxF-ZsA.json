That's kinda what I do, I just subscribe to things I think might be fun later.  Half the time I don't even bother watching any of their videos.  if I think their channel looks weird enough.  I just figure, eh, I'll put them in my subscriptions and maybe someday something they do will catch my eye.  So I didn't discover this guy, but something he did caught my eye.  To be honest, right this second, I'm not even sure if I'm gonna cover the thing that caught my eye, because finding that video got me watching more of his channel, and I found a bunch of other stuff that I thought was equally... mmm... depressing and terrible, if not more so.  Another thing that caught my eye was this guy has 1.66 million subscribers.  At least that many.  This was as of the last Social Blade count, before he apparently hid his subscription numbers.  Now, like I say, a lot of the videos on this channel raise several of my eyebrows, but I'm gonna start with the one that made me decide to do a video on this, because I think it's a beautiful visual depiction of the kind of problems that plague this content.  Usually this guy likes to do videos about talking to spirits through radio devices, but not this time.  This time, it's about dowsing rods. ",

How observant you are, the camera angle, how skilled the person is at making them move without making it obvious that they're making them move.  And of course, it also doesn't have to be their hands that move.  I mean, you're gonna point out pretty quick that these are extremely sensitive, right?  They rotate really easily, which means that a number of factors can influence it.  Body movement, like arm movement, torso movement, leg movement, movement of the environment, wind.  I mean, really there are just too many variables here for it to even make sense to give credence to this.  If you actually wanted to establish that these work properly, you wouldn't stand there holding them in your hands.  You'd put them in some sort of controlled environment with no ground movement, no air movement, clamp them down, you know, get the handles secured perfectly still in a vice or something, and then leave them alone and see what happens.  Talk to the spirits and see if the spirits can move them, but not while you're holding it in your hand.  The fact that people who are really into these insist that they have to hold them in their hands, which are inherently unstable, really should clue you in immediately that there's something off about this.  And apparently for you, at least at this point in the video, you claim that it does.  Which is a good start, you have some basis of skepticism, or at least a recognition of the concept.  But if you took that skepticism through to its logical conclusion, I don't think you would have bothered with the rest of this video, so it doesn't really mean that much. ",

Now, in saying that, I'm not trying to attribute motive.  You may be just another one of those people who's stuck thinking about it in terms of pure hand movement and nothing else.

Most people know of them as a stick that you walk along with and it tells you where water is.  Or gold, or oil, or whatever it happens to be.  And in fact there are some comments under this video about exactly that.  Let's take two seconds and detour onto those because these make me want to put my head through my desk.  I didn't see your hands move.  My dad used cherry tree branches in a Y shape to find water for wells.  He was a hundred percent.  Hmm, maybe you had a lot of groundwater.  I work for a water company and we've used these to find buried water lines.  And some people are better than others, but they work.  Are you sure?  That sounds like they sometimes work at best.  I wish I knew what company this was so I knew who to never hire.  Especially if some people are better than others.  What if you get the less magical guy out and he digs up your whole yard looking for your water line?  And this one doesn't have anything to do with finding water, but as a child of about six years old, my dad had told me to hold these and walk around our yard, instantly seeing a problem.  I asked what they were and they said, just a magic trick.  They said, hold them tight, to which I did.  Those sticks went back and forth, inside to side.  Yes, they do work for those that will keep their hands still.  I think it's easier for spirits to contact us and communicate with us with these.  So, when you were six years old, your parents gave you a toy and told you to walk around the yard holding them, and that caused them to move, because you're walking.  And now, as an adult, you still haven't managed to solve the riddle.  Oof.  You know, I hooked up one of those clappers to our light, and my five-year-old didn't even believe me when I told her that was magic.  Honestly, I know a six-year-old is a six-year-old, but even so I kind of expect better.  Anyway, the usual idea about how these dowsing rods work is the ideomotor effect.  Basically, exactly what Hough just said he wants to avoid.  Subconsciously moving his hands a little bit and influencing the way that the rods move.  And he says, well, I'm gonna try really hard not to do it.  Which of course is gonna make you not do it, about as much as saying don't think of an elephant is gonna make you not think of an elephant.  But at least he's not getting up with them and walking around.  If people's upper bodies stayed still when they walked, it'd be a lot easier to make walk cycles for animation.  The idea of walking around with these ultra-sensitive, unbalanced things and thinking that you're gonna get a reliable result, thinking that any movement you see in them is from the spirits, is probably one of the dumbest things I've ever heard.

In this video, you took a little detour and played an old video of you on board a ship.  And the problem with that, aside from the fact that you're on a ship, which might not necessarily stay perfectly level, was that whoever was operating the camera had it handheld.  If your goal was to establish anything, I don't know why you wouldn't have used a tripod.  Probably someone who has After Effects, which I don't, could successfully stabilize this and lock down the background so that the only movement that's visible is yours.

            "text": "Just to be clear, I will go through this again afterwards to get a closer look at the motion that's happening.  So I won't get too far into that yet, but I would be really curious to hear an explanation as to exactly why a spirit, when you ask it to move these that you're holding in your hands, is able to do it.  But if, say, you talk to the same spirit and you ask it to move a ball that's sitting on a table, which is at least as easy of a thing to do, if not easier, why it can't do that?  Unless you kick the table.  What's the reason for that?  And if it's something to do with spirits only want to touch things that you're touching, something-something spiritual connection, how can I reliably distinguish that from just, you're holding the thing in your hands and so you're influencing it?  Well, I guess the answer is to do an experiment with proper controls and see if it works the same way once you cut the variables out.  But every time that's actually tested, like for example when James Randi was testing people's paranormal abilities, it never worked.  I guess then there's some other excuse like, Oh, being tested is cutting off my connection to the spirits or something like that, right?  By the way, Mr.  Huff here has a tendency to make fairly popular videos talking to dead famous people.  A few months ago, he had ones with 11 million, 7.2 million, and 4.6 million views talking to someone named Sushant Singh.  who I believe is an Indian actor, who I personally don't know of, but apparently was pretty popular considering the view numbers on these videos.  He has some talking to Michael Jackson, Robin Williams, Eddie Van Halen, Charles Manson, and James Randi soon after he died.  And that video makes me want to throw up in my mouth, such as it is.  I might take a look at that one another time, not sure. ",

I mean, to identify the problem with the slightly blurry birds and the out-of-focus stars, you at least need to know something about how a camera works.  You know, the absolute basics.  And cameras are modern technology.  There's a lot of people who just don't know that much about them.  But to fall for this one, you have to be confused about your own hands.  I don't think believers in this have as good of an excuse. ",

However in-focus or out-of-focus they were at the start is how in-focus or out-of-focus they are now, and for two minutes that hasn't been a problem.

And more importantly... which I find is much more effective, watch the handles of the dowsing rods.  Because those are straight lines that go right down through the center of his hands.  If his hands aren't moving, if he's not moving the rods, then those handles should not be moving at all.  And that camera's locked down, so any movement that's on the screen is movement in real life.  Keep in mind as well, there's a couple spots where he transitions to a close-up, and because I have this sped up, and because we're trying to focus on the tips of the rods, and zooming in on them makes them move, and just makes it hard to focus on them, I've cut those parts out, so there's a couple very small time jumps.  I'll play it one more time, and again, just watch the angle of the handles.  Really, relative to the camera, they should be staying at 90 degrees.  But they're moving around wildly.  They're tipping inwards, they're tipping outwards.  I mean, it's plain as day.  And this is why we don't try to do delicate experiments with our FUCKING HANDS! ",
