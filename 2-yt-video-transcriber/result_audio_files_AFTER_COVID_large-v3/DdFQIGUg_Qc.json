This is Melissa Caron, and not only is she a witness at Trump and Giuliani's kangaroo election fraud hearing, she's the star witness.  This is the best it gets, this woman.  This is like a crazy Trump supporter doing an impression of Kate McKinnon doing an impression of a crazy Trump supporter.  Now, this was during the latest of Trump and Giuliani's so-called hearings, this time in Michigan.  And bear in mind, the only reason these hearings are necessary is because Trump and his allies can't manage to win in court, and so the only option they have left is to hold these sham hearings where the quote-unquote witnesses can basically say anything they want without worrying about telling the truth.  And Melissa Caron is a prime example of that.  Consider, for example, her claim that there was 120% turnout in Detroit.  As if an actual 120% turnout rate wouldn't have been brought up in a single court case.  As if an example of fraud so glaringly, blatantly obvious wouldn't have come before a single judge.  According to Detroit's own government website, out of the 504,714 registered voters in the city, 250,138 voted.  That's not so much 120% as it is 49.5%.  But hey, numbers can be hard.  Another issue she brings up is this claim that batches of ballots were being run 8 or 10 times or even more.  Only, if batches of 50 votes were being run 10 times and coming in at 500 ballots a pop, the counting boards would have been way off.  And they weren't off.  Which means that either they figured out a way to reinvent math in Michigan, or she doesn't know what she's talking about.  Take all the time you need with this one.  And by the way, even the Republican lawmaker here pushes back on this claim to which Caron says this. ",

            "text": "that the Republican lawmakers took it and quote, did something crazy to it.  Now she's claiming that Republicans are involved, which I guess shouldn't come as a surprise considering this entire conspiracy theory being propped up by the likes of Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell involves the CIA, the DOJ, Republican secretaries of state, Republican governors, Cuba, China, Venezuela, and Hugo Chavez.  who's been dead for seven years.  So yeah, why not just throw a few more Republican lawmakers into the mix of people who were apparently conspiring to take down the Republican president?  Totally checks out.  And by the way, Caron has already tried this whole song and dance in court.  And the judge, Timothy Kenney, the Chief Justice of the Third Circuit Court in Wayne County, Michigan, said that her description of the events quote, does not square with any of the other affidavits, and that quote, her allegations are simply not credible.  And so of course she became Rudy Giuliani's star witness.  Because he's not trying to win in the court of law, he's only trying to win in the court of public opinion.  So he found someone just as discredited as he is and made her the face of this circus.  Consider too that in this very hearing where she pushes back against allegations that she was discredited, she claims that she had to get rid of social media.  And yet somehow, when I typed her name into Facebook, there she was, with not only an active account, but a profile picture of her and Rudy Giuliani.  Doesn't exactly look like someone who's shying away from the attention.  In other words, she discredited herself in the same hearing where she lashed out over allegations of being discredited.  Surprised?  Yeah me neither.  And finally, she claims that she's telling the truth because she can't get a job anymore and so allegedly she'd have nothing to gain by coming forward.  Although judging by her decidedly not deleted social media, she's obviously reveling in the attention.  And I'll just say this, simply enough.  I don't think Democrats are why she's not employed.  Here's the thing, these Republicans who even agreed to hold this hearing probably did so because they thought there might be some political benefit for them.  They might have even thought that there was a chance they'd be able to help overturn the results of the election and keep their guy in office.  But the only thing to come out of this hearing were witnesses like Melissa Caron, who made the GOP somehow look like even more of a joke than it did before.  They knew there was no fraud, but they humored this sideshow anyway, and now videos like this one are the only thing making the rounds.  So great work.  Really.
