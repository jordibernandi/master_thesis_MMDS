            "text": "You can sort of get a sense of how out of touch the BBC are in terms of their response to the current criticism by just looking at this suggestion from the outgoing Director General of the BBC, Lord Hall of Birkenhead.  He has suggested that the licence fee could be replaced by a compulsory household tax that requires richer people to pay more.  This was said in a interview, his exit interview with the media show on Radio 4.  Lord Hall saying that progressive alternatives to the Batili licence were interesting and should be looked at.  He suggested that the annual levy could be collected as an additional charge on existing household bills such as council tax or broadband, meaning the corporation would supposedly waste less money tracking down evaders.  The licence fee in its current form, of course, guaranteed until 2027, but the government has indicated that a new system of funding suitable for the digital era will be required after then.  Lord Hall quoted as saying, I think finding ways in which the licence fee can be charged progressively so those who can afford to pay more and those who can afford to pay less should be looked at.  Should it be collected in a way on household bills, council tax bills to cut down the cost?  I mean, this is the response to unprecedented criticism of the licence fee, unprecedented criticism of BBC bias, and of course, the ridiculous BBC stance supported only by 9% of Brits in the YouGov poll.  that we've covered on here before in terms of stripping the problems of patriotic lyrics.  This suggestion, of course, sparking another major backlash.  Patrick O'Flynn saying this is an exaggerated sense of entitlement.  gone crackers.  People at the Beeb really think a compulsory new tax on every household to replace the licence fee is a goer.  Lawrence Flox You really don't get it, do you chum?  Leave.eu saying, outgoing BBC Director General Lord Hall has suggested the hated TV licence could be replaced with a tax on every household, whether they own a TV or not.  They're clearly spooked by defund the BBC.  Let's keep going and finish off the anti-British institution for good.  Susan Hall, leader of the Conservative group, at the London Assembly, simply saying, no, thank you.  And finally, Christopher Snowden saying, I have a suggestion for Lord Hall, but it's unprintable, even at this time of night.  Seems to me, guys, that... The crazy stances of the BBC just keep flooding out.  These are people who are so out of touch with mainstream British public opinion.  it's frightening.  But let me know what you think of this suggestion.  Are you in favour of keeping the licence fee?  Are you in favour of this compulsory new household tax that has been suggested?  or do you think like me that it's time the license fee and compulsory fees of any kind to fund the bbc are well past their their sale by date and need to be put out to pasture?  let me know in the comments and as ever guys help this exciting new media channel grow by subscribing and clicking the bell so you do not miss future reports.  thanks for watching guys.
