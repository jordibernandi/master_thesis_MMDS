She worked in patrol specialized units, including gangs, and she is the author of Black and Blue, the Creation of a Social Advocate.  Also with us, retired deputy inspector of NYPD's Corey Pegues.  Corey was in law enforcement for 26 years, spent 14 years as a combat medic for the U.S.  Army and New York National Guard.  He's also a former prosecutor and author of the book Once a Cop.  The street, the law, two worlds, one man.  We've got two of you here today, and I want to start with reaction to what came out of Louisville and what is still happening tonight in Louisville.  The breaking news, an officer with the Louisville Police Department has been shot, according to the department.  We don't have any details on the condition of the officer, but we do understand it was in connection to the protests that erupted following Louisville.  the announcement of charges in the Breonna Taylor case.  Cheryl, to you, your reaction on, I guess, let's start with what's happening right now, the images we're seeing right now.  It's very disconcerting to hear that an officer's been shot. ",

            "text": "Well, certainly I don't condone violence against the police, and so my sympathies go out to the Louisville Metropolitan Police Department, that officer and his family.  With regards to what we heard today from the Attorney General, I heard a lot of doublespeak.  I heard a lot of company speak.  I think he was being intellectually dishonest.  He cherry-picked evidence that he wanted to present to the grand jury.  We know that there was allegedly one witness who said they heard the officers announce their entry, but there were other witnesses also who allegedly heard nothing.  And so we know that there's a problem with this non-indictment, if you will, in that three officers were investigated, one was charged, and not with the murder of Breonna Taylor, but because he fired rounds into another individual's apartment.  If the officers had announced and made entry as purported, that young man, Kenneth Walker, would now be sitting in jail for attempted murder on a police officer if he fired first, as they said.  So this is their story and they're sticking to it. ",

            "text": "Well, first of all, I'm a veteran of over 200 search warrants.  A search warrant is one of the most dangerous things that a cop can do.  And the people that's on a search warrant should be trained, highly trained individuals.  And it's sad for me to hear that these cops that was at Breonna Taylor's House were just extra cops.  It's just like, we're going to take three.  We got three bozos.  We're going to send them over there and tell them to go knock the door down and arrest her.  That's not how you conduct a search warrant.  And I'm still stuck on.  how did we receive the search warrant.  From what I understand, there was five search warrants executed that day for her ex-boyfriend.  When was the last set of eyes we had on her ex-boyfriend going to the house?  From what they're saying, he had a piece of mail there in February.  The search warrant was in March.  Who was the last person to see him there?  How many looks did we have in the house that he had drugs in the house?  Who assigned, like what team did the search warrant?  You sent three people there.  Were there markings on the door to identify?  this is the location?  Was a vehicle there?  If I'm doing a search warrant and I'm a commander doing numerous violent search warrants, no knock and knock search warrants, those cops can't get the search warrant approved by me without telling me that they've seen somebody, the subject, go into that house within the last 24 hours.  And the time that we see him go into the house, I'm posting a cop in front of that building or that apartment to make sure that that subject don't exit.  So I have serious issues with the search warrant being executed, especially I have some issues with the judge approving five search warrants, and out of her mouth, she approved them within 30 minutes.  How can you do a search warrant approval in 30 minutes, five of them?  And they all had the same verbiage on it.  That's another problem.  So it's just like they was just pacifying these search warrants.  But the problem with law enforcement is like the cops are laying in bed with the prosecutors.  The prosecutors are laying in bed with the judges.  So this whole criminal justice system is out of whack.  And poor Breonna Taylor, her life was taken. ",

I don't know if he fired the first shot.  He admits he did.  Well, that's what they say.  he admits.  And so I haven't heard him in a courtroom say that he fired the first shot.  That's what they say.  And so, listen, I'm not just taking wholesale what they say, because what they also said is, is that there was no one injured.  What they also said is, is that there was no cameras installed.  on the officers.  And we've seen a still photo of one officer wearing a camera.  So, listen, there's plenty for me to be bothered by.  This Detective Hankerson came from Lexington Police Department before he was hired by Louisville.  And he was problematic over there.  One of the supervisors said they wouldn't even recommend him to be hired by another department.  Yet he was.  We know that he has a disciplinary history.  We know that he was facing several sexual assault charges on the Louisville Police Department.  And so, listen, let's not pretend that somehow these guys are choir boys and they were just, you know, happened upon a house and they were just fired upon for no reason.  They judge-shopped to get that no-knock warrant.  And I'm gonna tell you what I know as a 20-year veteran patrol officer who's involved in search warrants, if you have a no-knock warrant, you don't announce because you don't have to.  And so, again, because they say they did and they found one witness versus several who said they didn't, that's what the story is and that's what we should go with.  I'm not buying it. ",

And because officers are given great deference, much like an attorney general, their version is usually taken whole cloth.  And so please don't pretend that officers don't misrepresent the truth.
