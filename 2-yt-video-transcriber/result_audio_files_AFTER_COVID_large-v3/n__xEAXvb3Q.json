            "text": "Hello and welcome to another TLDR News US video.  Yesterday, Georgia headed back to the polls just over two months after 2020's presidential elections to elect two senators for the state.  Winning senators is always important, but this time it was truly pivotal.  Following the 2020 vote, control of the Senate was in the balance.  Republicans had 50 senators and Democrats had 48, including the two independents who caucus with them.  This meant that the two Senate races in Georgia were decisive.  Should the Republicans win even one, then they'd have a majority in the Senate.  McConnell would likely return as Senate leader, and with control over the Senate, the GOP could block Biden's more radical plans.  However, if the Democrats were able to scoop both seats, they could tie with the Republicans, 50 senators apiece.  However, the Democrats also have a Trump card, sorry, Harris card.  Official rules state that in the event of a tie in the Senate, the vice president gets to cast the deciding vote.  So with Harris as VP, the Democrats would, by the slimmest of margins, hold power over the Senate, and thus a trifecta, the presidency, the House, and the Senate.  So it was crucial.  If Biden was going to get many of his promised policies across the line, especially when it comes to matters like health care, climate and election reform, the Democrats needed those two Georgian Senate seats.  Now, the story is still unfolding as we're reporting on it, but it seems that the Democrats may have done exactly that.  We likely have a lot of confusion, protests and recounts ahead of us.  but right now it looks like the Democrats have won control of the Senate and thus a trifecta.  So in this video, we'll explain how they did that and what it means for the Biden presidency.  If you don't already, please consider subscribing to the channel.

It's linked down below.  So heading into 2021, all eyes were on Georgia.  The state played a pivotal role in the 2020 presidential election, as one of the states that flipped to the Democrats, handing Biden its 16 electoral college votes.  Despite this though, Democrats remained cautious about their chances in the Senate.  They'd not had a member of their party elected to the Senate by Georgia since 2000, and despite demographic and political changes in the state, it looked far from guaranteed that they'd win the state again on January 5th.  Quickly though, you might be wondering why we're having two more Senate elections in January.  Didn't we just go through a nightmare few weeks of deciding this stuff?  Well, as you might have heard, here's the key thing about Georgia.  Its election rules stipulate that if a candidate doesn't get an outright majority, the election goes to a runoff between the top two candidates at a later date.  As neither race was won with majority support, here we are again.  Georgia Senate races, take two.  The first of these runoff elections is between Republican incumbent Kelly Loeffler and Democrat challenger Reverend Raphael Warnock.  On November 3rd, these two battled it out, but the field was so crowned with other candidates receiving votes that neither two main candidates got the required 50%.  Just for clarity, Warnock actually bagged 32.9% of the vote, putting him in the lead, whereas Loeffler got 25.9%.  However, Doug Jones, the other major Republican in the race, got 20%.  So, despite Warnock having a clear individual lead, if you add up the votes of all six Republicans, you get 49.3%.  Whereas, if you add together the eight Democrats, you only get 48.4%.  with smaller parties, independents and right-ins getting the other votes.  So while it is very tight, the Republican party actually had the edge in November.  Now, not everyone who voted for a more minor candidate will automatically vote for the same party, but it does give you an idea of the closeness of this race.  The other runoff election is between Republican incumbent David Perdue and Democratic nominee John Ossoff.  that this field was a lot less crowded, with just one other candidate from each of the major parties, plus a libertarian.  Perdue was also close to a victory, gaining 49.7% of the vote, but just missing out on that magical 50%.  So despite Biden winning the state, Democratic victory in Georgia didn't look guaranteed, with Republican candidates leading in both races.  albeit not by a huge margin and not with enough votes to actually win.  So for the Democrats to actually win those races in order to gain control of the Senate looked like a big ask.  A big ask the Democrats do seem to have delivered on.  First, let's look at the Warnock v. Loeffler race, as the results are a bit clearer there.  It seems that despite her marginal leads in 2020 and attempts to rebrand herself as a major Trump supporter, Loeffler has lost the Senate race to Democrat Raphael Warnock.  With an estimated 98% of the vote counted, Warnock holds 50.6% of the vote, to Loeffler's 49.4%.  The margin may be slim and there may still be votes left to count, at least at the time of writing, but with most major decision desks calling the race for the Democrats, it seems pretty sewn up.  The Ossoff-Purdue race does seem a little narrower though.  At the time of writing, Ossoff is ahead with 50.19% to Purdue's 49.81%.  98% of votes have also been counted here, but with the margins so tight and recount possible, many aren't quite ready to call this decisive race just yet.  Although some, including Decision Desk HQ, did make the call pretty early.  Regardless, according to data from the New York Times, things certainly are looking good for Democrats.  While the expected margin of Ossoff's victory is very narrow, their predicting a victory is indeed likely, giving it a 95% chance of materialising.  So, it seems that not only has Georgia elected its first Democrat to the Senate in 20 years, but actually elected two.  In fact, not only that, Wardock's election marks a significant milestone for black Americans, with him being the first black Democrat elected to the Senate from the South.  Ultimately, it seems that increased momentum from 2020, campaigning from both sides, especially efforts from Stacey Abrams' campaigns, have helped the Democrats pick up both seats.  From the early data we have, especially looking at how votes vary by county, we can see that turnout in rural counties, which are overwhelmingly white, lag behind more urban and more diverse areas of the state.  It seems like this might have been the tipping point for the Democrats.  Without Trump on the ballot and with the GOP repeatedly accusing the 2020 election of being rigged, it seems the party found it hard to mobilize their white rural base in the state, setting the way for a Democratic win via Georgia's cities and urban areas.  We need a lot more time before we can draw any clear conclusions from this.  So we'll be back with more videos in the future, videos you'll see if you subscribe.  But it seems that this state that's been shifting demographically for years now might really be changing.  Even in 2020, many Democrats doubted their own chances when it came to the presidency and Senate in Georgia.  choosing to place greater time and attention on Florida and North Carolina.  Ultimately, though, Georgia has proven to be pivotal, especially when it comes to the Senate, showing that Democrats might have a real future in the state.  But as I say, only time and data will tell.  Speaking of the Democrats' future though, these votes certainly look to be hugely significant.  With a Democratic trifecta, albeit with very marginal control in the Senate, Biden's new administration is set to wield a significant amount of power.  A lot of Biden's most important campaign promises were unsurprisingly unpopular with Republicans, and despite many praising Biden's ability to reach across the aisle and work with the GOP, it's much easier for him if he just doesn't have to.  With the trifecta, Biden will be significantly more able to pass legislation and enact the changes he wants, without the fear of the Senate getting in his way.  With such a small margin, it doesn't mean that governing will be plain sailing though, but it does mean that for the next couple of years at least, things do look easier.  Suddenly, major democratic priorities like changing the healthcare system, working to fix issues around systemic racism, and environmental priorities suddenly looked more possible again, where they would have been difficult and likely significantly watered down under a Republican Senate.  It also means that the Democrats could look to reform the way that the whole system works.  Before the election, there was discussion of expanding the Supreme Court in response to Trump's last-minute nomination of Coney Barrett, but we could also see other changes to democracy.  The last few years have shown many Democrats that the norms and standards once relied upon aren't as secure as they once appeared, so many within the party are looking for reforms to prevent presidential overreach, gerrymandering, and the disenfranchisement of voters going forward.  All of this new potential that the Democrats likely have probably seems either amazing or terrible to you depending on your political persuasions.  It either looks like a protection of democracy, our planet and human dignity, or an expansion of government, governmental overreach and the Democrats pulling back electoral control, depending on which side of the aisle you find yourself on.  Regardless, as things stand, it looks like this may become a reality, with Democrats very likely to take control of the Senate.  Although, you likely won't have to wait until Biden starts governing for these partisan arguments to kick off, as it's inevitable that just like in the 2020 race, this too will be contested, and many will accuse Democrats of cheating.
