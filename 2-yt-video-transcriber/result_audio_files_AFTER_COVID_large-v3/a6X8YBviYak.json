            "text": "In the heat of the night, I got trouble on the water wall.  In the heat of the night, yeah, must be an end to it all.  Hey, it's Tyesha, and I am here.  I'm in Sparta, Mississippi.  Not really.  I'm here in Covington, Georgia.  This is where they filmed In the Heat of the Night.  I'm here at the square.  So I want to show you some locations where they filmed that.  And yeah, I've always wanted to come here.  And like this video, leave me a comment.  If you remember sitting with your parents or your grandparents and you had to be quiet while In the Heat of the Night is on, I remember my mom doing my hair and I was asleep by the time it went off.  So yeah, I hope you enjoy this video.  I always wanted to get here.  So now that I'm here in Georgia, I'm able to do it and I'm so happy.  So enjoy it a lot.  One thing that's really cool is that here in Georgia, a lot of the cities, the historic cities, they all look alike.  They all have the obelisk.  And I hope y'all go pick up Brother Tony Browder's book, anything from the Browder files, or if you're in DC, make sure you go take his tour, Egypt on the Potomac, because there's so many things that are from Egypt that are actually here in the United States.  And it's hidden in plain sight.  Blink and you'll miss it.  So yeah, I've seen so many of these obelisks all over the country.  So I'm gonna go across the street to this place called Hollywood of the South on Location Tours.  And I'm gonna see if they have any interesting memorabilia, trinkets, stuff like that.  And also inquire on a map, but I can find some other stuff.  But I believe that going down this street is where the police station is, so we're gonna go check that out, okay?  So they have like their little own Walk of Fame, the Hollywood Walk of Fame.  So here's one for Reese Winterspoon for Sleep Home Alabama.  And Philip Cohen.  We made it to what is the police station, but it is now a med resources health supply facility.  And out front, they have some things.  Like I said, it's like their Hollywood walk of fame.  But this is like the Hollywood of the South walk of fame.  And then here we go.  Here's the one for Carol O'Connor, Bill Gillespie, and the Heat of the Night.  So it's right here.  This is where they filmed it.  But it's actually, let's see.  This was the James H. Porter Memorial Library.  you're coming down the stairs.  here's the view to the left and there's the park we were just at and then here is the view to the right and this sits at the corner of monticello and conyer street.  so go across the street and try to get some better pictures.  I am leaving the Sparta Police Station and I'm going to walk by the Magnolia Cafe and then I'll head back to my car and then we're going to drive to some other spots that are further up the street.  But yeah, this is super cool.  So I need to get a thumbnail too.  Let me get my thumbnail.  So this here is the, or was the, Magnolia Cafe.  But it's now a, I can't read what that says.  by our insurance agency.  so that's what this building is.  but here was the magnolia cafe.  so here we go walk back to the park and then go to my car and then we'll drive around.  here's another one robert duvall and bill murray and get low came out of 2009. never saw it but i'm gonna check it out another one.  Oh, here we go.  Here's one for Alfre Woodard and Miss Ever's Boys.  I saw that a while back.  I gotta watch that again.  This is a good movie.  So we have this here and it's telling me that this was Strand Theater, 1976.  And this will be it right here.  Super cool.  Here, this is Nina Dobro, the Lena Gilbert, the Vampire Diaries.  Yeah, that's also filmed here as well, but I'm not into that series.  I haven't gotten into it.  Here's when they do ghost tours.  This is cool.  Downtown area is quite similar to the one in Macon and a few other places in Georgia where the center is a big roundabout.  No traffic lights, just a roundabout.  and yeah you gotta like go all around the world just to get around it with the crosswalks but it looks safe.  at least you don't have to pay to park which is great.  so yeah let's get a move on.  pretty cool although i've never been to new orleans but i imagine this is what it would be like.  so this is the area that they filmed the bottoms.  Thank you.  and close out this video while I still have good lighting.  So I hope you enjoyed this vlog through downtown Sparta, Mississippi from the show In the Heat of the Night.  We're here in Covington, Georgia.  So yeah, I will see you on my next vlog as I still explore Georgia and find out little historic tidbits and share with you.  Alright, have a great one.  In the heat of the night I got trouble, wall to wall, in the heat of the night, yeah.  Must be an ending to it all. ",
