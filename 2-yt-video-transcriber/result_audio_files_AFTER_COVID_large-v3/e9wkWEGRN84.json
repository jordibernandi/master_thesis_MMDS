            "text": "Actually, this is a good tangent as well.  Here.  This is great.  Here is a great example of this.  Here is a great example of, like, anti-communist indoctrination from early on, from something as, like, as inconspicuous as a Disney show.  Ms.  Matthews.  Farkel.  100%.  Ms.  Hart.  it's matthews you know.  a leftist fucking shot this by the way because farkel look at the insane like tv.  look at the insane setup like.  it's very clearly a leftist who shot this because they use the phone camera from 1997 pointed at the fucking tv.  because that's how it goes always.  100 you get a c what we get a. what's that you say now?  innocent inconspicuous innocent.  yeah innocent is a better word not inconspicuous.  when you get everything right but you don't do it yourselves.  it makes you average.  a divided by three is a c. look at you you're all the same you're average you're common communism.  This is why it felt people didn't want to all be the same.  Without incentive, there's no motivation.  Without motivation, there's no advancement.  In a truly free society, we share the best parts of ourselves without cheating.  Because we get to learn who we are individually.  Come on, guys.  Separately, you're the best individuals I know.  I miss you.  Please come back.  so i don't i didn't watch this episode obviously but even judging by what i've seen so far here i mean this is just fucking propaganda.  this is just straight the fuck up propaganda.  but the more nefarious part about this propaganda is this notion that like it directly counters the divided we bargain, or sorry, divided we beg, united we bargain mentality.  Like it is just, this is like straight up union buster shit.  You know what I mean?  And if you've ever worked at like a retail job that even had the inclination to talk about unionization, you've probably heard similar rhetoric on top of why would you pay union fees when you can buy a PlayStation?  You know, shit like that.  And also, as is the case with a lot of fascist propaganda, it literally contradicts itself.  There is a ruler that refuses to give you what you are worth because you work together to get a fucking A?  The fuck?  No wonder why you hate the PS5, LMAO.  I love the PS5.  I can't wait to fucking purchase the PS5.  I am a Sony simp through and through.  What the fuck are you talking about?  This is revisionist, brother.  I love Sony and I love PlayStation 5.  I just think it's ugly.  That's a fact.  When you get everything right, but you don't do it yourselves, it makes you average.  A divided by three is a C. Look at you.  You're all the same.  You're average.  You're common.  You're common.  You're average.  Commonism.  This is why it fell.  People didn't want to all be the same without incentive.  There's no motivation.  Yeah.  Um, the USSR fell because people didn't want to be the same.  I mean, it's a Disney show, so you shouldn't look further into it.  It's a fucking kids' show.  Communism?  Communism?  Without motivation, there's no advancement.  In a truly free society, we share the best parts of ourselves without cheating.  Because we get to learn who we are individually.  Come on guys, separately.  you're the best individuals I know.  I miss you.  It's just like, it's so strange to be like, solidarity is bad.  It's just fucking bad.  Keep focusing on the individual.  Solidarity is bad.  You mustn't ever help one another because then you lose your individualism.  But let me tell you who definitely helps one another and hasn't really... lost their individuality.  Let me tell you a group of individuals who always are aware of their class and make every effort to show class solidarity.  Motherfucking billionaires, okay?  If you think that the capital owners are not expressing class solidarity on a daily basis and consistently fucking working... to ensure that their position in society seemingly is well-earned and solidified and legitimized by even, in some instances, using Disney shows to repeat that narrative that any sort of solidarity for you is bad, then you are a simp, my friends.  Also leftist podcast streamers?  I don't know what that means.  It's the reason they all wanted to appear together at the recent hearing.  Yeah, USSR just averaged into space.  Yeah.  What are your thoughts on the US education system?  My personal thoughts are it's pretty bad compared to other countries' thoughts.  Yes, it's demonstrably bad. ",
