You're entitled to your opinion.  You may or may not be concerned about section 230 of the 1996 federal telecommunications bill.  That's fine too.  We may have a discussion about how we protect American democracy.  It's a good discussion as well.  But I have the strong feeling Senator Cornyn, that in Texas, as in Vermont, you know what?  People are really not talking about corporate liability.  It's a good issue.  It's an important issue.  I don't think they're talking about Section 230.  What I think they are talking about, as the senator from Illinois just said, how they're going to feed their kids today. ",

No, I gather that when that vote comes to the floor, and I hope it comes immediately, you'll vote no, and you'll explain to the people of Texas why you voted that way.  That's called democracy.  I respect that.  But what is your problem with allowing the Senate to have a free standing vote.  There are a number of people on your side, Republicans, who have already come forward and said, yeah, they want to vote for this $2,000 check.  Now, if you want to deal with corporate liability, that's fine.  Let's deal with it at some point.  Bring forth the bill.  We can vote on it up or down.  All that we are asking for is a simple up or down vote on the issue that tens of millions of people are talking about right now.  Will they survive economically in the midst of this terrible pandemic?  So I ask my colleague from Texas, what is the problem with allowing the U.S.  Senate to vote on the bill passed by the House?  And I yield to my colleague from Texas. ",

I have no objection to direct payments.  to individuals.  I voted for the $1,200 direct payment contained in the CARES Act.  I voted for the additional money that's provided for in the most recent COVID-19 legislation.  But this legislation that the Senator from Vermont is advocating would benefit households with annual income over $350,000.  They would get this money.  And I would say that one way to deal with this, because of course we negotiated back and forth on the last COVID-19 bill, nobody got everything they wanted, but if our colleagues on the other side of the aisle want an additional financial benefit to people making up the $350,000, why not couple it with liability protection for people who are acting in good faith?  This isn't just about corporations, and our colleagues across the aisle know it.  This is about schools.  This is about churches, synagogues, mosques.  This is about every business that's worried that a game of gotcha is going to take place and they're going to end up paying the price, even if they win the league.  Even if they win the lawsuit, they will not be able to, they're still going to have to pay for the cost of defense, potentially losing their business outright. ",

You know what?  Bring it to the floor.  Let's vote it up or down.  I will vote against it.  You will vote for it.  But I ask you a very simple question, not linking things together.  Nobody in the real world understands that stuff.  That's inside the Beltway stuff.  What people in the real world know, and I want to take a moment to read some of these statements.  because we sent out, we have a lot of people on our social media, and we asked the American people, just the other day, we said, tell me, what would a $2,000 check mean to you?  What's going on in your lives?  And in just over 24 hours, I would say to my friend from Texas, nearly 6,000 people responded.  And here is just what a few of them had to say, and we don't have, this is Twitter stuff, so I don't have their names here, and I wouldn't use it publicly anyhow, but this is what they say.  One person writes, $2,000 is the difference between keeping our apartment and being evicted.  Here's another.  $2,000 means I can afford to feed my three kids.  Another response, quote, it would mean not having to choose between rent and groceries and not having to ration my partner's meds, end quote.  Another response, quote, I am raising my grandson with medical needs.  I am $4,000 behind on utilities.  We need electricity to run his medical equipment, end quote.  Here's another response.  $2,000 would mean I wouldn't have to worry about making my mortgage payment this month and that I could get my medication, end quote.  Another response, $2,000 would mean paying my rent and getting life-saving treatment because I can't afford the $50 copay through my work insurance just to see my neurologist right now, end of quote.  And on and on and on.  Thousands of people responding.  So I want to get back to the point, and I want to again ask my friend from Texas, you got a concern about corporate liability?  Good issue.  Bring it to the floor.  Let's vote on corporate liability. ",
