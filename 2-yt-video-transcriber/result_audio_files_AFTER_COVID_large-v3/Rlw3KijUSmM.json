            "text": "Police departments across the country have spent the past week engaging in mass violence against peaceful protesters, ramming vehicles into pedestrians, using chemical weapons to disperse crowds, and assaulting and arresting journalists who try to report on their abuse.  That violence is a brutal reminder of how American police departments threaten and terrorize the communities they're supposed to serve.  It's also a reminder of how corporate media often protects those departments and delegitimizes people who protest against them.  Here are six ways the media protects violent cops.  One, repeating police bullshit.  Despite years of evidence documenting how police departments lie to and mislead the public, many news outlets continue to uncritically include police statements in their reporting.  According to police officials.  According to police.  According to police, we're throwing rocks and bottles.  Trusting police like this is always dangerous, but it's especially reckless when covering protests about the police.  in the days after protests broke out over the murder of george floyd news outlets in cleveland miami and minneapolis all published police reports claiming that many of their protesters were from out of town outside agitators.  the police called them anarchists in every city.  that was a lie meant to turn the public against protesters but by the time reporters could correct the record it was too late.  the police had already gotten the headlines they wanted.  2.  Copaganda.  If you've been watching the news, you've definitely seen a segment like this.  A cop hugging protesters, taking the knee with protesters, or voicing support for protesters.  Glimpses of hope breaking through the days of rage that somehow this time might be different.  Corporate media loves shit like this because it gives them a feel-good moment for their viewers who might not want to see their boys in blue gassing trapped protesters or beating the shit out of peaceful civilians.  But these segments are PR stunts.  Protests about police brutality have nothing to do with how sweet or polite a few cops are.  They're about what happens when that sweetness runs out.  Cops stage these stunts to bait the media and go right back to gassing and assaulting the very protesters they were just playing nice with on TV.  Three, shitty experts.  Every cable news network hires a handful of law enforcement analysts to comment on criminal justice stories.  Those experts are almost always former police or FBI.  And many of them run private security firms that still work with police departments.  As a result, they tend to be overly deferential to the police and flood the airways with pro-cop propaganda.  During the Baltimore uprising, the best example was CNN's Harry Hook, a former NYPD detective who would derail every segment with racist bullshit about black crime.  The black community, all right, is where there's most of the crime.  Let's say New York City.  Be careful, Harry.  Now it's CNN's James Gagliano.  A retired FBI agent whose Twitter feed is littered with pro-cop propaganda and who's already defended the police officers who drove an SUV into civilians. ",

            "text": "You wouldn't hire former tobacco executives to comment on the dangers of smoking.  You shouldn't hire former cops to talk about the dangers of police brutality.  Four.  Deference to authority.  When they're not relying on cops or former cops, news networks default to the next worst thing.  Politicians and city officials.  This is an easy shortcut for news outlets.  Protest movements are typically driven by community activists who are unknown to national press and don't spend a lot of time in network green rooms.  It's much easier to call city officials and politicians who already have relationships with reporters and can put on press conferences that protesters can't.  But this deference to authority has a huge impact on coverage.  City officials have close ties to police departments and are often responsible for the shitty conditions that spark uprisings in the first place.  They have an incentive to side with police over protesters.  because those protests challenged their legitimacy too.  A lot of police officers showed amazing restraint last night.  Relying on government officials narrows the Overton window, focusing on people who are more interested in order than justice, while excluding the voices of protesters calling for real change.  That exclusion doesn't happen neutrally.  A 2017 study looked at what sources were quoted in protest coverage.  Protests against anti-black racism were the least likely to include the voices of protesters and most likely to defer to those already in power.  Five, language games.  Here's a New York Times tweet that will live in infamy.  A photographer was shot in the eye.  Protesters struck a journalist.  A reporter was hit by a pepper ball.  Notice the difference?  The Times uses the active voice to describe protesters, but the passive voice to describe violence carried out by police.  You can find sanitized language like that everywhere in corporate media.  This tweet says, Pepper spray caused a short stampede in Lafayette Park, but doesn't mention who fired it.  This Vox article captions an image of a cop pepper spraying people by saying it became a clash between police and protesters.  And the CNN Chiron describes protesters as storming the streets of Oakland.  Language games like this are subtle, but they always have the same effect.  Scrutinizing the actions of protesters while separating cops from the violence they enact.  Six.  Who's peace?  Look at any corporate news outlet right now, and you'll probably see images of broken windows and burning buildings.  This isn't surprising.  Corporate media's business model is built on sensationalism.  So images like this get played on a loop constantly, no matter how rare they are or how peaceful the rest of the protest is.  It happened in Ferguson, it happened in Baltimore, and it's happening now.  This kind of coverage is always shitty, but it's especially dangerous given what cops are doing right now.  In city after city, footage shows police officers shoving into crowds, flying helicopters at low altitudes, brandishing military equipment, and opening fire hours before curfew starts.  This shit is designed to provoke a response.  It's a classic authoritarian tactic.  Antagonize protesters, beta reaction, then use that reaction to justify further crackdowns.  And while it would be great if everyone getting tear gassed and assaulted and driven into could just not react, violence and property damage are an inevitable response to police escalation, a response that's deeply embedded in America's moral fabric.  By focusing on protesters' reactions as opposed to the police violence that triggers it, news outlets help give cops the pretext they need to engage in further aggression. ",

            "text": "That focus on disorder also reveals a deeper bias about what corporate media finds newsworthy.  Anytime there's a protest like this, reporters will hound activists on the street, asking them to condemn violence and work for peace.  That line of questioning badly misunderstands the problem.  Technically, police states are peaceful.  Prisons are peaceful.  The whole point of these protests is that that's not real peace.  That peace in America typically means living under constant threat of state violence by racist cops.  With leaders who don't take that violence seriously, police departments that aren't held accountable, and news networks that don't find any of it interesting until something is on fire.  When corporate media talks about peace, they don't mean peace for those threatened by state violence.  They mean peace for those who've never found that violence to be newsworthy.  Until now. ",
