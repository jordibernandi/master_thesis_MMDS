            "text": "Well, imagine my shock everyone.  We're going to talk a little bit about Paul Joseph Watson.  He's been having a normal one lately.  He's been having a lot of normal ones lately.  I don't know if anyone saw this, but right after Lauren Southern announced her return, and her enlightened return, by the way, to centrism, immediately, Paul Joseph Watson got really, really upset.  Now, I don't know if he felt that perhaps her eggs were going to scurry away, and that he had to lay claim to the eggs immediately.  I know he's deeply concerned about eggs, and He did recently lose his egg brother in Stefan Molyneux.  Stefan Molyneux has been deplatformed from YouTube and Twitter, so he's kind of alone in his egg world right now.  I mean, there's plenty of other egg harvesters.  There's no shortage of men who are deeply invested in making sure they secure all of women's eggs.  But anyways, he had a bit of a strange reaction to this.  He texted her.  And the only reason we have this is we got this posted by Lauren Southern.  But comments on your video.  Can't answer.  Fraud.  Disappointed.  So disappointed.  You can't answer.  So pathetic.  Jesus, just allow the comments.  It's not hard.  Pathetic.  How dare you.  Fuck off.  Leave me alone.  Like, oof, man.  Just really strong incel vibes.  I've always gotten really strong incel vibes from Paul Joseph Watson, but it's just, it's pretty outrageous.  And then, thought higher of you, but after tonight, no, just have a family life and enjoy it and protect your child.  Much respect for that, but otherwise, fuck off.  He also made some other weird cryptic post about how he had been inside her or he knew her in the biblical way.  I don't know.  It was just really gross.  Gross and silly stuff.  But anyways, super secure.  Super secure in his masculinity.  Paul Joseph Watson, the alpha male of all alpha males, has now taken to attacking none other than... Anthony Fantano?  Like, how did this even happen?  Anthony Fantano makes a post that goes, cancel culture should be a lot less controversial if it was called people reacting to me being a shithead culture.  Okay, like, not that offensive, but whatever.  I should show mercy to these two losers, H3H3 Productions and The Needle Drop, but I'm so painfully more handsome than both of them.  It's tough.  If they both apologize for daring to challenge my vastly superior intellect and charm, I may reconsider.  The ball is in your court.  You're both fucking frauds, H383 Productions and The Needle Drop.  And the reason why I get under your skin and why you feel the need to respond is because you were both once authentic.  And you know that I know.  But you sold out.  That's why you hate me.  Because I didn't.  Oh, thank you.  This is one of the best ones.  I'm significantly more attractive and more interesting than you.  And so is my girlfriend.  Your girlfriend is very ugly.  And so are you.  These are facts.  Debate me.  And then I'll give it to Jack Sane.  Jack Sane started a wonderful meme where we just tried to one up each other one after another.  So then Big Joel sounded off.  And then see, I'm I'm significantly more attractive and more interesting than both Big Joel and Jack Sane.  So I had to, you know.  establish that right away just so they knew because if I didn't establish that they probably wouldn't have known but it's a good thing that I did that because I did that now they know and because they know it's known and so there's going to be a public leisure.  there's a record of all this.

Oh, fantastic.  I did not know that.  I thought there was an infinite market for the peddling garbage that he seems to spew forth, but it seems like he's on the decline.  So you love to see it, folks.  This is great news.  The only need to respond is because you were both once authentic.  But you know that I know.  That you sold out.  That you sold out.

Make sure you post a lot of that.  The final thing that I don't totally understand about Paul Joseph Watson is, again, he's not an unattractive man.  He's objectively handsome.  I don't know why he's so insecure about this.  Like nothing screams alpha behavior and male dominance being the alpha male when, you know, like screaming at people that I'm prettier than you.  You know, I'm much more attractive.  My girlfriend is hotter.  Your girlfriend is ugly.  Mine is good.  Yours is bad.  So there's all that. ",
