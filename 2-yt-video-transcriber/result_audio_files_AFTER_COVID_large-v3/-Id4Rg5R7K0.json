And that was a song I wrote and recorded in 74 in England.  If you'd like to check out that and the other tunes I did, you can go out on my website, therealronmisscavage.com.  And while you're there, you could become a patron if you'd like to support this program.  But whatever you do, please share this with other people and subscribe.  So I'd like to build up the subscribers so we're getting more and more people being enlightened by these shows and the abuses of the Church of Scientology.  So anyway, this morning we have one of my favorite guests and absolutely one of your favorite guests, simply from the compliments she gets from being on the show.  We've got Karen De La Curie back, and I appreciate you coming back on, Karen. ",
