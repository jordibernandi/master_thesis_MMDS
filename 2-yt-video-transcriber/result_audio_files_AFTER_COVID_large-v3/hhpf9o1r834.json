            "text": "hello.  i have some pictures that i want to share and i think they were from march the 24th.  i think it's been uh around a week.  i think it was the last set of pictures that i took of the ships that were in the sky and You can see the detail on here.  These ships are out there.  They're in our skies.  Even though you don't see them, they are cloaked in the clouds.  And, you know, it just now dawned on me, you see how this brownness, like, looks like it comes out of here.  Just picture this as like the cloaking of the clouds, because that's what happens.  They have some type of cloaking capability that, even though this is brown in my photo, in the skies, I've seen them, they literally cover up the ships.  They come from the ships, the clouds that come out like smoke or something, but you know it's not smoke, it's some kind of whatever they use up there.  I don't know what they use but it works pretty good.  these are some more of the um the.  I'm not going to call these ships because you know some of these look like rainbow cities or something or beings.  um look at this the structure of them.  you know they could be floating cities.  you could call them big ships that float.  um Yeah, but something definitely is going on in the skies above.  And I know a lot of you all have looked at the clouds, and you've seen rainbow signatures, and some dismiss them as, ah, it's just the chemicals they're spraying up in the sky.  That's all it is from something reflecting, aluminum and things.  No, no, it's not.  There are rainbow ships up there.  There's rainbow cities up there.  That's what I'm thinking.  That's what I'm seeing.  These ships are real.  You know, it's not particles just floating around up there, nano things.  It's not.  They're big long ships and they're in the clouds.  They're cloaked in the clouds.  And yeah, I don't know what this one is, but I just include it too.  We can see this right here.  It's really, I'm telling you, this is really good detail of how this is stacked.  And I'm going to say it again, they have the ability to connect like Legos.  They really do.  And this one just happens to be more out there than these.  These are hidden behind whatever it is up there in the sky.  It's like the other dimension, like they're peering through it.  see the rainbow colors right here and i do believe that there are um big giant sky beings in the sky too.  i really do.  um.  so let's go back.  this is um i can click right there.  it's really that's really beautiful it is.  um I like that.  I like that picture because it has so much detail to it.  Let me pause this video.  We're going to look at this ship in the inverted mode.  So that's the one that had so much detail to it.  and I only inverted maybe four pictures that I took.  so you can see what they look like and you say well what's the inverted mode?  it's it would be like if you had a roll of film and a camera back in those days that you would take your pictures and you had to send off the roll of film to get it developed because it was the negatives.  and if there was something that you did actually capture On your roll of negatives, then you get back a picture.  So this is basically what it is.  So let me do this.  I'm recording this because I don't want the video to be so short, like two minutes to show those pictures, but we can see some more inverted views.  Yeah, look at this.  You know, I don't get a negative feeling from any of these I don't.  There are some Strange-looking Dark dark ships that appear in the sky that I don't resonate with in my being.  They don't settle well But these ones right here I'm not bothered by them.  I believe they are light ships and yeah.  so I'm just going to end this video right here and then you'll see the pictures and they'll just go through each individual screen frame and then the video will end.  basically but thank you all for being interested and I apologize for not getting these out here sooner.  it's just like there's so much going on around my house and Just in the world, it's a lot to keep up with, but I'm trying.  I really am trying.  So thank you once again, and I hope you have a wonderful, wonderful day.  I really do. ",
