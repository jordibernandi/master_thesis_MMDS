            "text": "Can you close your eyes for a moment and imagine a scene from a Western movie?  The kind that has gripped people's imagination and endured across cultures and generations.  A sleepy town in the middle of an inhospitable but stunning desert.  A colorful sunset.  The wind blowing while a familiar tune is playing in the background.  The lone hero riding on a horse and looking for their next adventure, danger oozing from each corner and crevice.  Yet the speech is not going to be about the dashing rugged hero, nor is it going to be about discovering new frontiers or the struggle for justice and order.  In fact, the speech is going to be about the cactus in the background of all of this.  Can you see it?  It's a mighty 50 plus feet tall cactus with its arms up in the air as if reaching for the sky.  This is the saguaro cactus, a silhouette that is as familiar from the Western movies as mysterious to most of us.  Few people know its name and even fewer can tell you that it is only found in the Sonoran desert in Northwest Mexico and parts of Arizona.  The saguaro cactus is a fascinating plant, and in many ways, it reminds me of us, the PhD students, soon to be doctors.  It is not only a symbol of perseverance, but also one of immense potential to do good and to positively impact every creature in its ecosystem.  You see, first and foremost, the saguaro cactus is a patient and dedicated one.  It grows slowly.  It thrives on the scorching heat of the desert and grows one of its arms in about 50 to 75 years.  In fact, a 10-year-old cactus is only about this big.  It's only about an inch and a half.  Like a PhD student, the cactus takes time to grow its lifeline, an extensive root system that supports it through the years.  This is a tale that sounds familiar to many of us.  After all, we spend hours in libraries and labs, in cafes and maybe even bars as we search through a multitude of sources, design experiments, run said experiments over and over again until everything is just right.  We write papers, we write proposals, dissertations.  We craft lesson plans and teach.  We travel and conduct field research.  We interview people and we get to see firsthand what they're going through.  We presented conferences and organized workshops.  It's been a long journey with its ups and downs, moments of great joy and accomplishment, and low points of deep frustration.  Still, we persist and we keep on doing what we do.  It takes patience and it takes strength.  Earning your PhD is not for the faint of heart.  And today, as we sit here celebrating a milestone in our long journey, make sure to take some time to yourself to reflect, to give yourself the credit you deserve for having made it so far, for having earned your doctoral degree.  And as we are about to take on the next adventure and start the new chapter of our careers, Let's take a moment to think about the positive impact of our degree and training, of our ecosystem, of the ways in which we can do good in the world.  It is a critical task right now.  At first glance, the saguaro cactus appears to be a lone figure standing out in the desert landscape.  Yet, as it turns out, it is inextricably connected to almost every organism around it.  Its flowers and pulp provide sustenance to numerous mammals, reptiles, and birds.  Its arms, a shelter from the sun for desert birds, large and small.  May we too, like the saguaro cactus, give back to our university, to our home communities, and our future ones.  Whether it is by way of research, teaching, or service, we have the potential to leave a permanent positive mark.  So as we sit here today remotely, five, six, seven, or more years later, let us give each other a round of well-deserved applause.  We did it.  Congratulations, doctors. ",
