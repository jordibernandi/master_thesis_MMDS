            "text": "everybody if you like this video please hit that subscribe button and i think there's a. there's a bell there to ring that for more youtube content.  you don't concede to someone who cheated ever stop the steal.  it's sad that they have to steal an election to win.  we're gonna speak up.  the best part about it is that these are such industrious fellows like there's a cottage industry that's propped up of like everything donald trump does right like.  obviously on the media side including myself we love consuming donald trump and donald trump does bring in the numbers.  this is something that i will admit.  but also on the other side like on the trump fandom side these people that are fans of donald trump have also made they've turned this into like an industry like trump fandom sells and like it really sells.  if you're a black conservative you can become a media figure.  make a lot of money that way.  uh these people that make merchandise that pump out merchandise literally make merch about random things that are going on in trump's life.  guys should trump concede oh it's so good look they got their fucking shirt.  we support you.  we're gonna get through this.  we're gonna have four more great years in the white house.  dude this is just want to say stay in the fight.  we got you six.  this is fun but also terrifying dude like.  what's gonna happen when they realize that like the trump festival is over like there's no reason to concede?  for what?  for why?  i don't know.  there's a lot of gop establishment people out there saying you should just concede trump.  no not even true.  25 27 congressional republicans have officially come out and recognized.  they're not even like.  come on trump concede.  they've at least recognized that joe biden is uh the the president-elect 27. i want the president to know that we stand with them.  we stand with the u.s army the u.s armed forces the u.s constitution the american flag we the people.  we stand for america now and forever and for 244 years we stood for the presence of the united states of america.  I don't, does he not recognize that, like, for a very long time, like, those presidents that he's standing for literally, like, you know, bought and sold the people that look like him on the basis of looking like him?  Like, they owned slaves.  What the fuck?  That's so weird, dude.  What the fuck?  fuck that is so strange.  this is like.  i mean like.  loving america is one thing but god damn like.  how the fuck did you ingest that kind of copium dude.  we're holy shit.  you just assume his race.  yeah my bad we'll never concede because we the people we've never conceded for this country and we're gonna defend it.  we're gonna speak up we're gonna speak out and we're gonna fight for this country.  this is the land of the free because of the brave.  we're not gonna be silent we're not gonna sit in our corner in color.  we're gonna fight for this country and we ain't going anywhere.  so get ready for it.  okay i don't know how someone gets to that level like he's got to be selling merch or something right.  please tell me at least you're making money on the side.  dude.  come on dude.  if this is real like if this is honest that's so much worse than him.  like just at least fucking selling merch or something you know.  give a message for president trump at all real quick.  Okay, at first I thought like this was, you know, on accident that she was just like throwing a mic on every black person that she sees.  It's now looking to be a little bit more deliberate.  Also, this dude literally straight up looks like the Key and Peele black Republican sketch.  Like every part of this literally looks like the Key and Peele black Republican.  We are not a monolith sketch.  Hey, we're still in this.  Wow, I'm kind of on the spot right now.  So he can see it under any circumstances?  But we had the brown jacket and he had the fucking goatee.  It's so funny.  The funniest part about like Trump supporters is that like you're already a fucking clown when you're still at this point supporting Donald Trump.  You were a clown when you were supporting Donald Trump from the jump.  You don't need to fucking wear a clownish hat to like.  really, I guess I really appreciate it.  Like it's, it's like a tell.  You know, you're, you already are a fucking clown if you're a Trump supporter, but then they also go and like wear this comically sized hat.  You know what I mean?  It's just like, it's, it's funny.  Like I can just laugh at all of it.  That's so exciting.  Show us your shirt.  I've been growing my mustache since September.  How original.  Liberty hangout.org.  Yo, dude, Republicans have made being lame into a literal aesthetic, dude.  Do you want to never have friends like ever, both in high school or in college?  Like just get a fucking sweatshirt that says baby lives matter on it.  Like that is wow.  That's bad, dude.  What inspired you to do that?  Oh, God, it's fucking this psychopath, dude.  Oh, my God, the fucking crimson chin.  Oh, Jesus Christ, Mr.  Habsburg jaw himself.  Scott Pressler, Courtney Holland, Michael Kudroy, CJ Pearson.  Literally a consequence of inbreeding by royals.  Like, honestly, respect to Ali for being the only brown person with a Habsburg jaw because, like, it's white people shit for the most part.  For those of you who didn't know, you learn something new here every day.  But Habsburg Jaw is a condition caused by inbreeding amongst royals and the royal family in Europe.  And honestly, he might be the only brown person that's ever had that condition.  I've never seen it outside of this.  So it literally looks like he just hit the fucking... He maxed out on the chin.  Like he wanted to do the Giga Chad... jaw when he was like on the character creation uh scene but he failed to look at it from the side.  he went too far on the fucking slider.  dude you chin maxed a little too much.  donald trump man you are absolutely amazing.  i do believe your face needs to go on.  mount rushmore i will always stand on your behalf because you stand for all of america.  you are the only one i see standing up for the cause Bro, every time I see Trump supporters, like, I don't know if they're specifically picking these people, but, like, I just want to say, are you alright?  Like, what's wrong with you?  There's just something off about every single one of them.  You know what I mean?  It's, like, never, like, a normal person.  It's always, like, some fucking weirdo, right?  To be honest, like, the most hilarious part about the Boo Boo Bennett videos, the reason why I love watching her videos is that... There was a point in time in the 2016 era, and even before that, in the post-Gamergate world, where these alt-right, anti-SJW centrist YouTubers would go around and find some of the worst, most hysterical-looking lefties.  They would purposefully try to paint a picture of the left by looking at these like hyper specific instances like people being fucking hysterical or whatever to make the left look like this cartoonish depiction.  and boo boo bennett basically does it for the right.  so it's like a gift.  you know what i mean like.  she's not even doing it on purpose.  you're not trying to make the republicans look bad.  she still ends up like finding appointing a camera to like random trump supporters of the rally and they all look fucking strange.  like there's something off.  They need to call, uh, what was it?  General Flynn said martial law and revote.  General Flynn, dude.  Oh my God.  These people are fucking straight QAnon.  Do you have a quick message for president Trump?  Keep fighting.  What?  Keep fighting.  Keep fighting.  Bro, oh, I forgot to mention this.  QAnon apparently is now overrepresented with women.  There is a higher percentage of women within the QAnon movement.  And the speculation is that it's because it infiltrated all the holistic medicine circles.  it's facebook moms but it's also because of like all these fucking weirdo like hippie ladies that love crystals and shit that started believing in like the the q anon adjacent version of it.  um there's a lot more white women involved in in q anon.  there are than there are.  uh white men for example.  yeah they they fucking fell for like the the classic like multi-level marketing slash a holistic medication or holistic medicine circles on the internet.  yes i voted for trump and you can't tell me he did not win considering all across america.  we voted down socialism.  we voted down intersectionality.  you're a woman stupid.  i mean we voted down intersectionality.  i just i'll never understand it like i get.  why ben shabibo says fuck intersectionality.  it would make sense.  if i'm like fuck intersectionality you know what i mean because i'm at the fucking.  i'm at the top of the hierarchy the structure.  but like when women say this shit i'm like.  what are you doing?  Oh my God, I love you.  Can I hug you?  I want you all the time.  Is that a message for me or President Trump?  For you, I love you.  Dudes don't stop winning.  L's have been exclusively handed out to women this year.  Just try and disprove my thesis.  Oh, dude.  Dudes Rock 2020 is kicked off into high gear.  Jesus Christ.  Is that Rosie the Riveter on a fucking Trump shirt?  What is happening, dude?  We love you.  So he can see it under any circumstances?  No, no, no.  Definitely not.  He's the ultimate fighter.  He's going to win this thing.  There's no quitting this man.  Like, that dude looks normal.  Like, he just looks like an accountant.  Like, this dude could be my accountant.  What do you do when you find out someone that, like, you work with?  is this guy?  You know what I mean?  Like, some of these you can tell from, like, seven miles away that that's a Trump supporter right there, okay?  They just, like, they're fucking beaming.  It's like they got a goddamn, like, beacon on them.  This motherfucker just looks normal.  What do you do?  This guy's your manager at your workplace.  Like, what the fuck do you do?  Should Trump concede?  Excuse me?  Should Trump concede?  Absolutely not.  No one has won yet.  I think these people don't know that, like, it's been authorized already.  Like, Joe Biden has more electoral college votes than he needs to even win at this stage.  Like, these are certified election counts.  So technically, he has already fucking, he's like, he's won.  I don't know why.  This is not a free country anymore.  This is not a free election.  You know, it's supposed to be liberty, right?  Oh, fuck.  What is that accent, bro?  There's no such thing as liberty right now.  Where are you from?  Originally Australia.  Australia?  I knew it.  This fucking Aussie dipshit, dude.  What the fuck are you doing, brother?  Why'd you come here?  What's wrong with you?  I knew it.  I could hear it in there.  What did you do?  How does this happen?  You think Trump should concede this election?  No.  heck no what the fuck.  look at these big boys dude i love these guys.  oh my god dude.  these guys are awesome.  they're so thick they're so beefy dude.  look at these beefy boys dude i love that.  i mean literally yeah heck no brother you kidding me oh my god i haven't seen such big boy representation since since mike huckabee's big beefy boy children dude oh it's so good that's a big beefer representation.  these are these are some chonkers dude.  these are some husky boys right here and that's exactly this is oh peak physical performance brother.  look at this.  Look at these chunkers.  Fucking Paul Bunyan Andy over here, dude.  I can't stop thinking about how fucking rotund those guys were.  They're so perfect.  I love them.  I really do love those people.  Like those guys, that fucking brother team, dude.  Oh my God, they're fucking sick.  Why is this pussy wearing a mask?  What do you think, coronavirus is real?  Oh, black Republican in the background wearing the, the, the fucking suede or, or brown jacket also with a goatee.  But anyway, that's besides the point.  He and peel sketch, uh, once again, vindicated.  I mean, come on, come on, come on.  Hi ladies.  Do you have a message for president Trump?  really quick?  Yes.  Go president Trump.  And we love you.  Do you have a message for president Trump?  Do not concede.  Do not concede.  Absolutely.  as I look around and I see these delusional psychopaths, okay, I think to myself, how delusional are the fucking liberals who think that you can unite with these people?  Because these people are fucking brain dead and they've been brain poisoned for But they've been brain poisoned by professional Republicans that Democrats are now trying to unite with.  Like, what are you doing?  Just reach across the aisle, reach back around and just fucking shove it up your ass.  That's more productive for you, you know?  At least you can get some prostate stimulation out of it.  I love that button.  I like it.  God's guns, Trump.  You guys remember when Barack Obama said all like Republicans care about is God's guns and was it oil?  And now that's like literally fucking Donald Trump's line.  Like he literally says, as he did yesterday, where he was like, Democrats, they don't like God's guns or oil and they think you can win.  Or not gods.  God.  Sorry.  God, not gods.  Yeah, the LGBT I care about is liberty, guns, beer, and Trump, brother.  That's what I'll fucking give a shit about.  Like, is this a new thing?  Have there always been Americans?  Is this delusional?  So, the Chapo boys have a speculation on this matter, and I think I agree with them.  I think that this is a good take.  And this kind of makes sense if you think about Trump's turnout strategy and how he's been able to turn out people from fucking all different parts of the country that normally... would not have voted or rather turned people away from the Democratic, the demon erratic party.  They believe that it's because he speaks at their level and like he fucking gets these cranks.  You know what I mean?  He meets the cranks exactly where they're at.  And I think that's why so many of these people are like, there's always been fucking delusional people.  American politics is so fucking delusional.  It's all delusional people with very unique sets of opinions that are oftentimes inherently contradicting.  But this level of delusion, I think, is because of Donald Trump himself personally.  He has done a really good job at captivating the attention of these cranks and freaks and hogs because he talks to them like that.  He talks to them in the way that they understand.  He doesn't do the educated dog whistle where 60s, 70s, the dog whistle was like, oh, no forced busing, no integration.  Politicians would say shit like that.  Now it's like Mexicans are rapists.  Oh, no, I just mean like the, you know, the rapist Mexicans.  Those are the ones who are rapists.  And people like that.  Like the lowering of the... It lowers the barrier of entry for the dog whistles. ",
