I understand the effort that gets put into producing YouTube videos, so I thought I'd help them out a bit, seeing as how usually at least a few dozen of my viewers check out the originals.

No mention of hell, no mention of heaven, except the occasional prophet who gets to go live with God himself, but that's not open to the general population.

But absolute morality is absolutely out.  Absolute morality is the idea that an action is moral or immoral regardless of the situation.  So is killing wrong?  Yes.  Killing is wrong and nothing can justify it because it is absolutely wrong.  Self-defense?  Nope, it's wrong.  And actually, I used to go to a church that supported this idea.  I once heard a sermon there where the pastor proudly proclaimed that he would not use violence to defend himself or his family from a home invasion because violence is absolutely wrong.  Of course, this view is not supported biblically.  If killing and violence were absolutely wrong, then violently killing people wouldn't be the punishment for so many crimes.  So if you think there are situations that justify acts that you normally would consider immoral, then you do not believe in absolute morality. ",

So thinking about these events with human nature in mind, most of us just naturally feel like those events were immoral.  We just generally don't like the idea of genocide.  Now, I can't speak to the culture of the time when those events supposedly happened.  But in our culture today, this is how it is.  And there is evidence to suggest that morality shifts with culture.  So if the culture was different back then, they may not have seen these events as immoral.  As to God's character, he comes across as petty, vindictive, and cruel.  He straight up kills a guy for trying to protect his precious Ark of the Covenant, because in trying to protect it, he touched it, and God just can't have us icky humans touching his special box.  When Saul angered God by not being genocidal enough for his tastes, rather than just remove him from power, he sent a spirit to torment him.  And you know how the Levites are the tribe of priests?  Do you know how they got that position?  They were the ones who answered the call when Moses told them that God wanted them to go through the Israelite camp, slaughtering brothers, sons, companions, and neighbors for the crime of having switched religions.  As for the way of salvation, if we are to accept the Jesus story as true, then that means that the vast majority of these people that God either killed himself or had other people kill for him ended up being tortured for all eternity in hell.  So if that's the path to salvation, it's not a very good one, at least not from a human perspective. ",

And if Eden really were supposed to be perfect, I can use it as a model.  I find two simple modifications to the Eden model that will make it actually be perfect, or at least closer to perfection than it was.  No serpent, and no tree of knowledge of good and evil.  Now, Adam and Eve can't bring sin into the world and everything is hunky dory.  Of course, this leads to future problems with the design.  Eventually, the world will be overpopulated with people and animals who keep mating but can't die.  So that's an issue.  But it would be an idyllic life for a lot longer than God's original design.  But ignoring all of that, Adam sinned.  Therefore, all of his descendants should be punished.  Does that seem moral?  If I do something wrong now, should my great-great-grandkids be punished for it?

Okay, so I just went back to the YouTube page and turned on closed captioning, which were not auto-generated, meaning that they were deliberately typed out.  And yeah, I did not mishear that.  We were all inside Adam when he fell.  I think someone needs to explain to AIG how babies work, because no, we absolutely were not in Adam when he fell.  Like, how would that even work?  Did Adam have a specific sperm that would be able to create every single person who would ever exist?  Did these sperm not go through the normal process of either being ejected or being reabsorbed by the body?  And would that mean that Eve had all of the eggs that would match up with these sperm cells to create all of the people?  because the sperm isn't the be all and end all.  It's only half the genetic material.  So for this interpretation to work, Eve has to have an egg for every person to have ever existed, which at the current moment adds up to just over 100 billion.  Women usually start life with about one million egg cells.  So that's five orders of magnitude more eggs for Eve than is normal.  And that would also assume that Adam had all of this sperm simultaneously, which is less impressive than the eggs.  But the average man makes about a billion sperm per month.  So that is a hundred month supply of sperm in his balls at one time.  Unless you mean we were spiritually in him somehow.  Was he possessed by the spirits of 100 billion people at one time?  Did our spirits have consciousness that we forgot about?  Did they have any say in his fall?  Was their choice to eat the fruit a democratic process with the spirits of 100 billion not-yet-born people all weighing in on it, and that's why the fall applies to all of us?  I don't know, man.

God has not provided me with sufficient evidence to believe in him, despite what Romans 1.20 says.  I am of the opinion that we do not choose our beliefs.  I don't choose what I find to be convincing.  It will either convince me or it will not.  I am not convinced of God's existence.  If God wanted to convince me of his existence, it would be a trivial matter for him, but thus far he has not.  Even laying this aside, setting up a system of choose me or burn forever is not moral.  It is applying duress to a choice, and a choice made under duress is not truly a choice. ",

I'm so generous in allowing you to not be in hell right now.  You should be thankful.  Now love me or burn forever.  You deserved to be hit.  Come on, apply some of those critical thinking skills you're supposed to be teaching.  This is almost exactly the language that abusers use to justify their abuse.  If the justification for how God behaves matches exactly with what an abuser says to justify abusing their partner, then that means that either the abuser is justified or God is an abuser and is unjustified.  As an atheist, I don't have to just accept that everything God does is good without question.  So I'm free to go ahead and say that if the God of the Bible exists, he is a serial abuser.  But you, host of the Critical Thinking Scan show, have to suppress your critical thoughts in order to justify the abuse.  Will the show that is called Critical Thinking Scan actually start to display some critical thinking skills?  To find out, tune in tomorrow.  Same Rhino time, same Rhino channel.  Thank you. ",
