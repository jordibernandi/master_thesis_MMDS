            "text": "Let me lead this really quickly, by the way, because for some reason there are also a lot of defeatist conservatives out there who have bought what the media have sold.  Let me tell you something first off.  I want to be really clear here.  We do not know that Donald Trump has won.  I want to make that very clear.  There still is a very good chance that he's lost.  Probably more likely than not.  But we definitely don't know that Joe Biden has won.  These are people who cannot be bothered to do their due diligence and do some research, so they just go, oh, well, AP called it, oh, well, Fox News called it, oh, well, CNN called it, so good enough for me.  What is this?  What would you have us do right now?  The pink Okamis have been steamrolling the streets.  By the way, they've been burning down.  Biden rallies.  Just so you know.  What, you want to just roll over and die?  You want to roll over and die?  Shall we roll over and die, Bob?  Is that what you want?  That's not what I'm going to do.  No.  That's absolutely not what we're going to do.  People who say that, people right now who are like, oh, it's over.  First off, again, they haven't done their research, and I think that you are going to feel a lot better.  You're going to feel a lot better after having watched this broadcast.  Those are people who've never been in a fight. ",
