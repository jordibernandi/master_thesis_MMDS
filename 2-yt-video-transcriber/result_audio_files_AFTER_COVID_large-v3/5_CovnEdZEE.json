            "text": "Friday the 13th, March 2020.  This will stand as the beginning of the new era, whatever that turns out to be.  That was the day that the United States of America went into a massively destructive panic for no good reason.  Since the middle of February, the coronavirus had begun to infect our thinking, and as we watched Italy turning itself off like an old building with a breaker box on every floor, all of us began to obsess about the COVID-19 super germ.  And now, as we approach the last week of April, it feels like the country we love is itself in the ICU on a ventilator, and we are all preparing for the worst.  America is, as always, breaking down into two groups, those who are ready to call this the new normal and pull the plug on our freedoms, and those who are turning their frustration into anger and calling out for extreme resuscitation measures.  How the hell did we get here?  Well, the story is long and complicated, but if I had to pick a single ingredient without which none of this could ever have happened, it's this one.  Misinformation.  Let's not sugarcoat it.  We are where we are because of lies.  Going all the way back to Wuhan and the Chinese Communist Party and ending up in most state and county governments and even in the ranks of the one body we all turn to for truth the national coronavirus task force.  not the whole task force of course just the two people in it who we counted on to give us the straight truth.  from an unbiased scientific perspective What started out as, and has largely been, an admirable non-partisan group ended up committing the greatest sin of all.  While we turned to them for unvarnished fact, they cooked the books and manipulated us.  Weeks ago I covered Anthony Fauci's lies about face masks and how he pretended that those masks could do us no good, and that the N95 mask was intended to be worn by infected people to stop them from infecting others.

As if we didn't know that the number on the label referred to the percentage of stuff it trapped, 95%.  He just flat out lied to us.  I guess we're too stupid to ask why a mask would protect a nurse from water droplets full of danger, but would be counterproductive if worn by us.  But it wasn't just Fauci.  Dr.  Deborah Birx was also taking the international platform given her by the president and handing us misinformation.  Here she is several days ago admitting that all of the stats from the  U.S.,  whether we get them from the CDC, Johns Hopkins, Worldometer, CNN, or Birx herself, were spun to make this novel coronavirus appear more deadly than it really is.

To update you on our current status, I'm really sad to report 55 additional deaths today.  This is the highest daily total we've reported.  after reporting high totals both yesterday and the day before, and it really reflects the devastating power of COVID-19.  43 of the people who passed away were over the age of 65, and 39 of the people who were over the age of 65 who died had underlying health conditions.  Nine people who died were between the ages of 41 and 65, and all of these people had underlying health conditions.  This brings the total number of deaths to 455 in LA County, and our mortality rate for COVID-19 is now 4.2%. ",

This is a complete and total lie, and she knows it.  Maybe that's why she has so much trouble getting the words out.  It's not just that she doesn't know the death ratio.  She knows that she can't know the death ratio.  In order to get a percentage, you need both a numerator and a denominator.  All through March, my liberal friends complained that they couldn't get tested.  That when they went to a hospital or urgent care, only those who were symptomatic received a test.  Meanwhile, we learned that many people who are infected never know they have it because they are asymptomatic.  So if only those with symptoms were allowed to be tested, all of the data collected was inaccurate because asymptomatic cases and people who'd had it and recovered were not in the equation.  Not just inaccurate, but inaccurate in the direction of overestimating the case fatality rate.  A lot.  Here's a medical professor and researcher at Stanford University explaining the issue.  It's a short clip. ",

It's a very strange thing to say, given how much data is floating around.  And it sounds like it's a remarkable thing, but it's actually just a plain scientific fact.  And that has to do with the fact that the testing for the virus has focused on people who actively have the virus.  The tests have been used everywhere.  That's what it does.  It looks and sees if the RNA of the virus is in you.  And if it's in you, then it's positive.  If it's not in you, it's negative.  And then that's that, right? ",

            "text": "But he didn't just sit idly by, he put together a study right there in Santa Clara County, one of California's hotspots.  They tested 3,000 people for coronavirus antibodies, which are present in somebody who has had it whether they knew it or not.  The study showed that the number of people who have had the virus in Santa Clara County is maybe 50 times higher than has been reported.  That would be the denominator, 50 times higher.  Therefore, the case fatality percentage is much, much, much lower.  But wait, Monday USC came out with a similar study.  So now Barbara Ferrer is forced to admit what any thinking person knew, that all her previous case fatality estimates were nonsense.  The number of cases in LA County is not 14,000, but somewhere between 221,000 and 442,000.  You compare the 600 deaths to these numbers.  So it turns out that when you don't cook the books in order to scare the population into sheep-like compliance, you have a virus that is just about as likely to kill you as the common flu, perhaps less likely than the strain we had in the 2017-2018 season, which hospitalized 900,000 Americans and killed 61,000, including a larger ratio of young people than the coronavirus does.  Without this intentional tilting of numbers in order to frighten us, we would not have 22 million unemployed people who don't know when they'll work again.  We wouldn't have tens or maybe hundreds of thousands of businesses facing bankruptcy.  We wouldn't have added trillions more dollars to the already ridiculous deficits that we are soon to leave to our children in the form of debt.  And we wouldn't have seen an unprecedented erosion of our constitutional rights.  We're almost done here.  Please share this video with your friends.
