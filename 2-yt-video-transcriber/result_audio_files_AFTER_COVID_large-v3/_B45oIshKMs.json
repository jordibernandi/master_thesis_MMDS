            "text": "Republicans are losing it over Bernie Sanders's new position, chair of the Senate Budget Committee.  Now, in this position, Bernie has quite a bit of power.  So before I get to any of the reactions from conservatives, including a hilarious video from Lindsey Graham, let me start here with this quote from Politico.  They say here, So using budget reconciliation, which Bernie Sanders has already said, and I'm going to show you that he's going to use, Democrats only need 51 votes to pass legislation.  So the issue then, I mean, this is a whole other discussion, but the issue then becomes Joe Manchin.  And will Joe Manchin, the ultra conservative Democrat from West Virginia, will he jump on board with, you know, a big spending push for health care, for example?  Unlikely.  This is where someone like Chuck Schumer, if he were a strong leader, would come in and try to whip that vote, but that all remains to be seen.  At the very least, it's good to know that Democrats only really need 51 votes to pass major bills.  Now, let me get to... First, what Bernie is saying about how he will use this power before I get to some of the reactions from conservatives.  So Bernie tweeting out here.  And this from Warren Gunnels, Bernie's staff director, saying, So you already see here, Very specific ideas in how to use budget reconciliation to get help to people, starting with $15 an hour.  And as I'm going to get to from Politico here, Bernie's also discussed how he won't only use this to help during the pandemic, but also he's looking to the future in terms of real systemic change in helping people.  So as Bernie says here to Politico, I'm going to use reconciliation in as aggressive a way as I possibly can to address the terrible health and economic crises facing working people today.  As we speak, my staff and I are working.  We're working with Biden's people.  We're working with Democratic leadership.  We'll be working with my colleagues in the House to figure out how we can come up with the most aggressive reconciliation bill to address the suffering of the American working families today.  So you can go to this link, by the way.  I'll link to this below the video.  Read the whole interview.  Bernie discusses a lot more of how he may use this power towards trying to help people.  And again, has brought up how the GOP have used it to pass massive tax cuts for the wealthy and help large corporations.  Here, Bernie in this position using it to actually help people.  Now, let me get to some of the... People that are scared, scared about Bernie's new role.  So this actually goes back to 2016.  So this is a Vox article from 2016.  Speaking at an event with college Republicans in Wisconsin earlier this week, Ryan warned that letting the Senate slip back into Democratic hands might give Vermont's Democratic Socialists one of the most powerful positions for shaping the federal budget.  Quote, if we lose the Senate, do you know who becomes chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Ryan said.  According to The Nation, a guy named Bernie Sanders.  Ever heard of him?  That's what we're dealing with here if we lose control of the Senate.  Ryan's hit on Sanders backfired badly.  Citing Ryan's comments in a fundraising blast, Sanders was able to raise just under $2 million in two days for about a dozen Democratic Senate and House candidates, furthering his chances of actually becoming budget committee chair.  Now, unfortunately, we all know how 2016 turned out, so that didn't happen.  But four years later, Bernie now has this position.  So that was Paul Ryan's reaction back then.  Now we got Nikki Haley.  tweeting this out on the 16th, saying, Oh, dear.  Horrible.  Can you imagine a politician using his power to help people get health care, address the climate crisis, put money into the infrastructure, or cut defense spending?  Oh, what world are we in?  It's amazing.  People like this, like Nikki Haley, their whole purpose is to obstruct any potential progress.  Meanwhile, are all the while complaining about people that actually work to help people.  Using their position in power to actually deliver help to people in need.  Who knew?  It's amazing how people's priorities are all twisted up and they think they're on the right side of history.  Now, one more reaction here.  Lindsey Graham on Fox News with Maria Bartiromo.  Let me play this. ",

They're going to roll back border security at the border.  And you see the caravans beginning to form now.  They're going to raise your taxes.  They're going to impose regulations on the economy.  They're going to try to make DC a state.  They're going to try to implement parts of the Green New Deal and Medicare for All through budget reconciliation.  I've got a fight on my hands. ",

Obviously, the best part of this whole story is that Bernie has his position.  But the cherry on top is that you have conservatives freaking out that Bernie Sanders is actually in a position to help people. ",
