            "text": "Hi guys, this is your sister Kerri-Ann in Jesus Christ.  Brothers and sisters, I want to come to you with a revelation that the Most High has placed in my heart and in my spirit concerning Beyonce.  For those of you who have been following this channel, you know that I've done couple videos well concerning that woman, okay?  And I'll try my best, if I remember, to post the links for the visions that the Lord has given me concerning her in the description box.  Now, I have no idea why the Most High shows me celebrities.  don't ask for it or anything like that but he does and one of the reason why i think that the lord does this is because his people are hooked on these people and yah wants to free hallelujah.  hallelujah the most high.  yah wants to free his people from uh all these the most high.  uh yah wants to freeze people because he hates idolatry.  he hates it brothers and sisters.  he is a jealous god.  he's a very very very very jealous god and he knows how his people goes into idolatry.  and he safeguards hallelujah his body by telling us to refrain from idolatry and worshiping people as god.  and We know that Beyonce's followers idolizes her in a way that some of them think she's a goddess, a goddess to be worshiped.  You don't do that.  And even some born again believers still follow Beyonce and sings her music and carry on with whatever she has to do.  But you have to be very, very careful.  because what the Lord showed me concerning Beyonce is not good, brothers and sisters.  And I heard round about, it's this week actually, this week, what date are we on?  We're on the 14th.  So sometime this week, brothers and sisters, I heard in my spirit, Beyonce's time is short.  That is what the Holy Spirit revealed in my spirit, brothers and sisters.  And the Lord has revealed a vision to me in 2016.  And that was the first vision actually.  Yeah, that was the first vision I think I've ever had about Beyonce.  And it's to do with... Beyonce, Jay-Z, and Kanye West, when they were all friends.  And I've never released that, and I'm not gonna release it.  I'm not gonna release that vision.  But yeah, in my spirit this week, brothers and sisters, I just heard Beyonce's time is short.  So, you know, If you want to pray for her, it's up to you.  You know, I will never come in here and tell nobody who to pray for.  You have your own spirituality.  You have your own walk with the Most High.  Hallelujah.  You know, I've actually heard people say that she's going to be saved.  You know, that she's going to be, she's going to turn.  life and give it to the Lord and then God's gonna remove or something like that?  I don't know.  well I've actually heard people said that God is gonna save or whatever.  but you know like I say it's up to you.  you know if you feel led in your spirit to pray.  that's totally up to you.  not gonna come on here and tell you to pray or not to praise absolute to you brothers and sisters.  but the visions that I've seen concerning her it's not good.  They're not good.  They're not good visions.  They're not good.  And the entity, the entity that's taking over this woman is fierce.  It's a very, very fierce entity.  It's like a man, a man demon.  Call it that way.  Very, very fierce.  So there's a wicked fallen angel.  is that one.  very very wicked fallen angel?  um and you see the thing about it is that when people worship her they're not really worshiping worshiping her it's the entity it's the.  it's the entity inside that that she carries gets the praise and all the glory and that that praise and adoration should be given to christ and when you like i say adultery is a very very wicked thing it's The Lord takes it serious.  He will kill you for that.  I'm telling you because he's a jealous, yeah.  And so, yeah.  It's on with Beyonce, you know.  But I wanted to come.  And I felt, you know, it was my duty.  I felt like it was my duty to really come and release Beyonce.  Thus said the Lord what he told me in my heart concerning her.  I wasn't even thinking about Beyonce, to be honest with you.  But it just came in my spirit.  And I said, yes, Lord, I'll warn those.  who says that there are children of you, but still listen to these wicked music.  I don't know how some people, I don't know how some people do it.  It just, it baffles my spirit.  It really baffles my spirit.  how you can walk with Yah, yet still you indulge in ungodly music.  I don't know some people do it.  I just say that they're still saved.  I was listening to Wicked T.D.  Jakes and I'm going to do a video on that man because it's on my heart to do a video about Freemasonry T.D.  Jakes.  Yeah, I was listening to him.  That's before I knew he was wicked.  But anyway, I was doing an interview.  And I think the interviewer must have said to me, all right, Pastor Jakes, you know, tell us what kind of music do you like or something like that.  And I was just shocked.  It was like, yeah, he likes that music, he likes blues, you know, I like R&B.  And I'm thinking, R&B?  Come on, RMB is wicked.  You know what this thing's about.  Nothing to do with you.  It's all sexual immoralities, you know.  I need to do a video on walking with you like Enoch.  I promise, brothers and sisters, I'll do a video about that.  promise and I will I'll do a video.  but yes brothers and sisters this Beyonce girl the visions that I had about that I have that I have had so far about her they're not good.  and yeah he's warning because he doesn't want any shrines or anything like that you know.  and so I just wanted to come really and truly and and release this vision.  and also like i said i'm repeating myself but it is to warn let me just.  there's a scripture.  hold on one second brothers and sisters.  just one more brothers and sisters.  there's a scripture.  you know i don't wanna I'm almost there.  These people are wicked brothers and sisters.  King David says that word.  I have hid in my heart so that I will not sin against you.  And sometimes we've got to literally hide the word of the Messiah in our hearts so that we do not sin against him.  Okay, I cannot find the scripture that I wanted.  I cannot find the scripture that I wanted, brothers and sisters, but... Okay.  All right.  Not to worry.  Not to worry.  All right.  Here it is.  Here it is.  I'm not going to read all of it, but it's a very, very powerful scripture.  Very, very powerful.  And it's Galatians 3.  And it says, O foolish Galatians, who have bewitched you that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ has been evidently set forth crucified among you?  This only would I learn of you.  Receive he the Spirit by works of the law or by hearing of faith?  Are he so foolish, having begun in the Spirit, he now made perfect by the flesh?  But there's actually, I'll find the verse and next time I'll do it for you, brother and sister.  But this is an old foolish Galatian who has bewitched you.  Who has bewitched you, church, to follow these celebrities?  Who has bewitched you to take it upon yourself as becoming the body?  You see, those who are without Christ can do anything.  because they're insane.  you know they're insane and they do not know.  yah but once you come into the body of the messiah he's expecting you to walk with him.  don't be like the foolish galatians.  don't do that.  brothers and sisters get rid of idolatry.  it will land you in hell.  so be bold be strong be courageous.  walk with yah just like enoch.  All praises.  All praises to the Messiah.  Who lives above the heavens.  May I eternally bless you.  I love you all.  And I will see you soon.  Someday in glory.  In Jesus Christ's precious holy name.  Amen and amen.  Amen.  Blessings.  Amen. ",
