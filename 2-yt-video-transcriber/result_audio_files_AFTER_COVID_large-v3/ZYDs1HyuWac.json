That's clearly helping the virus to spread out of control.  So there's widespread public concern that the government is in hock to these giant outsourcing companies.  Concerns at Serco and the like aren't just ripping off the public, but they're putting lives in danger.  So does the Secretary of State think that the public should be reassured or worried by the fact that Serco's former chief spin doctor is now his minister for health. ",

            "text": "So that's an interesting allegation.  So Richard is saying that somebody who used to work for Serco is now the minister for health.  Now, it's important to remember that the secretary for state for health is Matt Hancock, but the minister for health is someone different.  But surely that can't be possible.  So who is the minister for health?  Well, the minister for health, his name is Edward Argar.  Now, this is an article from two years ago.  It's about problems, to put it mildly, between Serco, the company that Richard Argar used to work for.  and how, you know, the wheels of the machine are oiled.  So it says here, Richard Argar, in the second paragraph, Richard Argar, a former head of the UK and Europe Public Affairs at Serco, which runs, this company, Serco, runs five prison, sorry, runs five private prisons and a prison escort service, was appointed as justice minister, so before he became health minister, he was justice minister, after Philip Lee quit over the government's Brexit policy.  Circle has contracts with the Ministry of Justice worth \u00a33.6 billion.  and is under investigations by the Serious Fraud Office over a former deal with the company related to electronic tagging of offenders.  And Richard Bergen actually raised this issue before about how Edward Argar used to work for Serco and then he got a job in the government.  So he was moved into the ministry and then the ministry offered a contract to Serco.  Now he's in the health department.  He's the minister for health.  And Serco is running the test and trace.  Now, it could be completely legitimate or there could be a problem with this.  So just before Matt Hancock responds, so let's hear what Matt Hancock has to say.  Of course, Matt is going to respond to this in an articulate and robust manner. ",

It doesn't matter.  Look, Matt, if you had said we're testing everyone in the country, sorry, we're tracing everyone in the country, that doesn't make one bit of difference if the system isn't working, if you're not seeing results.  Test and trace has been on the go for a while now, and the pandemic is expanding.  It's more, the number of new cases is increasing.  So there is a problem.  Now, Why did you hire Serco to do this?  Is it because they're the most competent?  Was it necessary to hire Serco?  Surely the NHS could have done it.  Maybe they couldn't do it because they didn't have sufficient funding.  So if the NHS couldn't do it because they didn't have sufficient funding, whose fault is that?  Could it be this idiot who's on the screen now?  Isn't he responsible for the funding of the NHS?  Why is all this money, like the \u00a33.6 billion we saw in the other article, that was transferred to this private company for these contracts, and they're incompetent also with that for justice, why did they receive this contract for Test and Trace?

The problem is I don't want to pay the fine.  The policeman maybe doesn't want to give me the fine.  So I give him less than the fine.  And then we've gotten around the problem.

It can't do the test and trace because it doesn't have the resources available because you have decided not to give them the resources.  So they have to go to the private company.  That's a great way to justify corruption.  We've gutted the NHS.  Now the NHS have to ask private companies to do it.  But don't worry, I have a list of private companies that are acceptable for us.

Don't worry about that.  He will have a new job.  He will be a conduit.  He will be the conduit where money flows out of government, Tory government, obviously, into the boardroom of a company like Serco.  Maybe it won't be Serco, it could be KPMG or another private company that will be offering top quality service to the British public.  Once again, guys, you know, joking aside, this is corruption.  You have the a former head of information at Serco, now the minister for health.  You know, we sort of laugh at this when it takes place in third world countries.  How can the government be previously somebody working in the private sector and now they're handing over contracts to the private sector?  We laugh at this type of corruption when it's in third world countries or developed nations.  The UK is not a developing nation.  The UK is not a developing nation.  The UK is a first world country.
