Last week, I put out this poll after being asked by the amazing Craft Tequila to name one of her baby goats, and you were very, very certain in the name that you all wanted.  I've linked Craft Tequila's channel in the description.  She makes some very interesting videos looking at the psychological aspect of conspiracy theories.  It's definitely, definitely worth checking out.  Anyway, that gives me an idea.  I wonder if Flat Earther Nathan Oakley can do an impression of a baby goat.  Give it your best.  Meh.  It's not bad, actually.  Now, I have a long history of correcting flat earthers when they say silly things.  But since my last video, I've been aware that there are a number of occasions where I myself have been corrected.  And today, we're going to look at two of those.  Firstly, is by this guy.  He's not even a flat earther.  He's just an anti-modern physics conspiracy theorist.  That's right, Draft Science is a fellow YouTuber who used his exceptional attention to detail to call me the Pake Physiccer of the Week.  And since making that video, he's followed it up by issuing me a physics challenge.  Now, to be fair, I'm not sure if that's a real challenge or a Pake one, but I will get around to it and I will find out.  Anyway, he's not my biggest fan. ",

I've linked it in the description if you've not seen it.  In this video, I tell the story of wave-particle duality, but I rewrite the history of some of the key plays involved just because I'm silly.  But it does appear that draft science doesn't understand the meaning of satire.  Thomas Young was named Thomas Young by his parents because as a child, he looked very young.  I mean, again, it's not even close to funny, but his last name, he didn't have any choice about the last name.  The parents told me to choose the first name.  Yeah, so you get the idea.  He obviously didn't understand that I was mixing real science with fake history.  But while I was watching that, this happened.  Hello? ",

            "text": "So I went on YouTube and I found this.  Flat Earth Millionaire was right.  I was about to be humiliated.  live on a Flat Earther's channel.  Now, if you don't know Ranty Flat Earth by now, he's actually a pretty nice guy and we really love him.  In fact, we've created our own little introduction for him.  These are the adventures of Ranty the Flat Earther as he explores the strange world known to Fraggles as The Globe.  Now the reason he has that introduction is because he's secretly a globe hero.  He will film things that are only possible on a globe, like this boat sailing over the horizon.  And then he will point blank deny what he's just seen, like on this occasion where he made this video, no boat went over the horizon.  So let me bring you up to speed with what I said that he's about to debunk.  In the last video I showed you this image which was presented by a flat earther as evidence for the Earth not being a globe.  The yellow line is a flight path taken by some airlines from Sydney to Santiago and the red line is what the flat earther believes would be the fastest route.  The fact that some flights take the path that's marked in yellow is a little bit confusing to this Flat Earther.  He seems to think that on a globe that yellow path would make absolutely no sense whatsoever and we should be following that red path as in his words it's the shortest distance between those two points.  But I tried to explain to him this isn't the case because when we take a 3D object like a globe and we try and flatten it out onto a 2D surface like a map, things get distorted.  Now that point is highlighted here in this image from Qantas Airlines own website.  The red line shows what a direct flight from Sydney to Santiago would look like if it was flattened out onto a two-dimensional map.  Yeah it's a very simple point and here it is just in a nutshell.  Well in a nutshell the flat earther simply thinks this.  If the earth is a globe a direct flight from Sydney to Santiago should pass north of New Zealand.  Meanwhile, back in the real world, everybody else thinks that a direct flight from Sydney to Santiago must pass south of New Zealand and will absolutely not be a straight line when plotted on a two-dimensional map.  So, after hearing me say that, what do you think ranty Flat Earth's reaction was?  Do you think it was A, to maybe sit and think about it for five minutes?  Or do you think it was B, fire up a live stream and do this?  But the bigger problem you've got here is that you think the red line is the quickest point between A and B. Now, what you've got to realise is that when we turn a globe into a flat map, you distort the picture.  And that means that the fastest path between these two points on a globe is anything but your red line.  Oh, ho, ho, ho! ",

But you should have taken a look at New Zealand.  You're so funny.  It's above the line.  But now it's below.  So I guess you're wrong, but that's just the way it always goes.  And if that doesn't help, how about this?  Yes, in this picture here, drawn by the Flat Earther, the red line clearly passes north of New Zealand.  But when Ranty tried to recreate this line on a globe model, the line had to pass south of New Zealand.  And finally, Ranty, representing that on a two-dimensional map would look a little bit like this.  Not this.  So I hope in future, Ranty, next time a flat earther tries to tell you that the flight paths we see don't make sense on a globe earth, that you remember this moment and you put them right.  Now, as far as the yellow line and why some flights have to take that path, Wolfie6020 explains that really, really well in one of his videos.  So for the third week on the trot, I'll link one of his videos in the description.  In that video, he talks about the cabotage law and how legal restrictions apply to flight companies from the Northern Hemisphere that prevent them going from Sydney to San Diego in one stop.  That's all I'm going to say.  I don't want to rob Wolfie of any views.  So he gives a very, very interesting description of all sorts in that video.  Please check on it.

Now, before we dive into chat box travels and have a look at some comments, we really should put something at least vaguely educational into this video.  So I'm going to take a quick look at how we take a 3D object like a globe and turn it into a 2D representation.  We're going to start by taking a look at something called a stereographic projection.  And then we're going to take a look at a cylindrical projection, which produces a type of map that has confused our flat earthers so far.  Take it away.  So let's take a toy globe and then mark a point at let's say the North Pole and place it on a piece of paper.  We're then going to draw an imaginary line from the North Pole through the sphere until it hits the paper.  Now the two black dots we're left with represent a point on that globe and the point on the paper where we draw it.  Now if we carried on doing this through every single point in the globe we'd end up with something that looks a little bit like this.  Now you won't see many school kids using these in the classroom but they are favoured for people who work around the poles due to the fact that on a stereographic projection the meridians radiate straight lines from them.  The Mercator map that the Flat Earthers showed us is an example of a cylindrical projection.  only in this point we draw our lines from the centre of the globe and then we unfold the cylinder to show our map.  So there we have it.  Now like I said before both Wolfie6020 and Blue Marble Science have videos linked in the description.  They have dealt with this subject very well in the past week or so but for now Chatbox travels.  chat box travels space comma.  now if you've not seen chat box travels before this is a part of my show where i get to sit back and look at some of the fan mail i've been receiving from flat earthers.  sometimes i might reply or sometimes i might just stand in awe at the sheer unique brilliance of what i am witnessing.  now we're going to start off with a regular contributor who seems to be struggling to get his words out.

Go.  What's diffraction?  Oh, it's quiet.  He doesn't know what diffraction is.  To be fair, you didn't give him 10 seconds.  I'll give you 10 seconds to Google it.  Go on, what's diffraction?  Oh, and good servant, just in case you didn't know, the guy on the other end of that telephone call, you know, the one who wasn't speaking, that was Nathan Oakley.
