And I was just talking about how as our constraints or as our borders or as the area around us gets smaller and smaller and smaller, you know, in that sense of like, you know, sports, you know, a whole generation of husbands is not going to know what to do because, you know, every single sports league has been taken away.  But all of these different things, you know, restaurants are closing, things like that.  They're limiting the groups of people that can be together.  But as those, the boundary becomes smaller and smaller, that's what produces fear.  That's what produces, you know, panic in people.  But they really pointed this out that it's also the opportunity for something brand new to be birthed in that moment.  And I think that we found that, I mean, even this, there's no reason why we couldn't have done something like this before.  But it never even really became an idea or a thought until we couldn't do what we were so used to doing every single Sunday, just... But I think just that idea of end times, I guess kind of in closing is everyone has an opinion of what this all means and what it's not.  But I think the one thing that we can all agree on is it's a wake-up call to what's really important.  The things that we think we valued is so important are taken away from us.  It changes us.  We're all forced to do different things.  And I think that... The thing is, how we respond today really shapes who we're going to become or what we're going to do tomorrow and so on. ",

You spent a whole week, you spent years and years and years studying this, but I just want to kind of put it out there for people who are watching.  If people want to try to get a grasp on this, something that's not going to go too far deep in to say like this means this.  and this means this, because obviously a lot of this is pure speculation.  You know, a lot is, you've detailed out some very specific things, but a lot of it is just, we just don't know.

And we shouldn't assume that speculation is wrong, but I think that when we look at something and somebody states, well, it could possibly this and be possibly that, well... In terms of something being possible, yeah, there's all sorts of possibilities.  But what is logically possible?  And that's where when you study this topic, you try to, at least what I try to do, is try to find out what are the parameters in which the scriptures define this event and how do I make all those various parts fit together.  And it is a very difficult thing.  And I don't put my views out there as if they are the final word.  Because I'm like everybody else, I'm growing and my understanding changes.  And I think one of the problems we've had historically with people trying to understand end times prophecy is they look at the world around them at that moment in time and then try to interpret it within that context.  And I admit that what I do is I look at what's going on in the world around me and see how does it line up with what the Bible says.

You're saying, oh, just here's something to think about.  But what I found is that when people say that something's possible, It's so much more than that.  They hold that view deep in their heart and it actually is affecting how they live.  And so they're making their decisions.

Or if they have a group, they're a group of people that are fairly sycophantic and supporting of whatever they come up with.  And I think that in one sense, none of us like the idea of being challenged in what we're saying, but there is, as Proverbs says, as iron sharpens iron, so a man sharpens the countenance of his friend.  And I read those views, many of them that are put out there, and I've read different books on it and tried to take in and see how it works.  At the end of the day, there is no perfect explanation because the perfect hasn't yet come.  But more importantly to me is the fact that we are watching.  We are watching.  We're looking at the world around us.  We're looking at the word of God and we're trying to say, Lord, what are going to be those signs of his coming?  And, you know, again, I've stated my opinion, my personal point of view, that I can't, I don't believe there's been another time in human history where we have had more evidence to point us to or at least more signs pointing us to the end times than what we have in the world today.  the whole point is that uh these aren't things that we go to battle over each other these aren't central issues.  what is i think central is that we believe that christ is going to return and that we must believe on him in order to be saved.  The other issues, you can hold your opinions.  We can disagree.

And that idea of you saying like, well, it's a job, you could very easily turn things into, well, it works.  And lose sight of like, that's totally not what the Bible says.  That's totally not what it... So it's not about just because it works doesn't give us a justification for... for doing it.  But I think the other thing is, you know, when you talk about end times, really, I think depending, I guess this is probably more relatable to people who either grew up in the church or maybe they've been following Christ or studying the Bible or been in church for many, many years.  And they get so focused on the end times and focusing.  if now we are, if we're there or not, or how close are we, or basically kind of, as you talked about, we're just gonna hold on because we know what's gonna happen in our lifetime.  which I'm not sure how we know it's gonna happen in our lifetime.  I didn't figure that out.  But we lose sight or the focus of the part in Revelation that says, occupy till I come.  And so easy for us to just become kind of irrelevant in what we're doing here because we're just holding on, but it's just looking different. ",

And yet it is proving to be a very powerful way for Christians to connect in a very real way.  I mean, my wife and I spend more time FaceTiming our family and friends than we ever did before.  And it's kind of like, it's interesting because we're talking about more significant things as well.  And we're able to minister to one another in ways that we never had the necessity to.  And I think that's really interesting because God doesn't ever let anything happen except for a greater purpose.  For decades, we have been talking about what would we do if the day comes where the government forbid us to worship?  What would be our response?  And it's interesting, now it's happened. ",

And I think the interesting thing is, is what's gonna happen after we're not forced to?  Are these gonna be new things that we have been challenged to think in a different way?  Or are we gonna just be tempted to go back to the way things were and get back into our own a way of doing things.  But it's been exciting.  Really, it has.  It's been challenging for a lot of people.  And I know a lot of people watching this are facing struggles.  And we're praying for you.  We want to hear from you. ",
