Religion, to me, is one of the greatest curses of our particular species.  People often ask me, do you believe in God?  And I say, which God?  Any of the thousands and thousands of gods that are out there.  No, I don't see any compelling evidence to believe in a god.  But my personal opinion is that religion is probably an attempt, an early attempt, a primitive attempt to explain the world.  And the easiest way to do it is to invent an agency that is all powerful and can do all these things that you don't understand.  Because what are these people telling you?  These people with the horoscopes on the wall and the earring and the funny hat, the fortune tellers, the astrologers and whatnot.  What are they telling you?  The message is clear.  You are inferior.  You're not a member of a proud, capable, dignified species, a great species that has done wonderful things, along with some of the mistakes, yes, but wonderful things.  It's been said before, to forget history is to be forced to relive its errors.  These demons of which Carl spoke are still out there, somewhere, waiting for their opportunity.  We cannot allow them to come back to life.  Our greatest enemy by far is ignorance.  We have the weapons to defeat it, and we are increasingly able to do so.  Try abracadabra.  Abracadabra.

On the 7th of August 1928, Randall James Hamilton Zwinger was pulled out of a hat by parents Mary Alice and George Randall Zwinger in Toronto, Canada.  Little did they know, their tiny spark would go on to become the Amazing Randy, and inspire millions of people, including yours truly, to champion skepticism and science.  From a young age, Randy was inquisitive, wanting to know exactly how the world works.  For instance, his younger sister, Angela, recalls him blowing a hole in the floor whilst conducting a chemistry experiment from the basement below.  You know, perhaps this was Randy's first trick.  Alakazam and the floor is gone.  Other times, the neighbours were called to ask the Zwinger family to stop Randy from doing whatever he was doing since he was interrupting their radio reception, chiefly by playing around with his shortwave radio.  It seems that in his curious pursuits, Randy was forever getting himself in trouble.  Potentially spurred on by his mischief, his parents sent him to Sunday school, but as Randy conveyed in a Big Think interview, he was expelled immediately. ",

In the 1940s, such charlatans as faith healers, psychics, and mind readers were prolific, and Randy could have easily have been the worst of them all.  Hell, the man was so convincing he could have started a new religion.  He was extremely charismatic, entertaining, and intelligent, and he could have employed his gifts for his own gain at the expense of the vulnerable, all whilst telling himself the platitude that he was just trying to comfort people.  But no, Randy gave his gifts to us.  He used them for the greater good.  As a jack of all trades and master of all, he performed all of the psychic and divine powers more convincingly than all of his adversaries, just to expose their depravity.  And he took a lot of heat for this, not only from the charlatans, but from the fold, who favoured the illusion over the truth.  Right out of context. ",

And I've carried it around because I found that I'm a believer now.  Now, look at the bend that's in the other key.  No, I won't take my eyes off this key.  Very good.
