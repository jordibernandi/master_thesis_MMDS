And the Lord spoke to me out of Second Kings and Chapter 22, 22, and it's a story concerning Ahab and Jezebel, which is exactly what we think is happening right now.  And so Ahab wants to go to war with Gilead, and he brings down Judah, who's a separate tribe at that time, and invites Judah to come down to that.  Will you help us go to war and beat Jabesh-Gilead?  And so Judah said, bring out the prophets.  Well, he brings the prophets of Baal.  He brings the prophets that Jezebel had been formulating, which I knew was the media.  I mean, immediately in my mind, this is the prophets of Baal and Jezebel. ",

That's powerful.  And so we realize that if we give ourselves into fear, then we're being consumed, and everything we see is filtered through fear.  Or we can hear what God is saying and filter it through light.  And so when he gave me these verses of scripture, and Judah says, well, is there not another prophet in the land?  And he says, well, there's one.  I don't like this prophet.  I hate him.  And he said, he never prophesies anything good.  The prophet comes down, Micaiah, and he comes down and he says, we need to hear from God.  Ahab says kind of flippantly, we need to hear from God.  And so Micaiah said, well, let me inquire of the Lord.  He comes back in a few minutes.  He said, I've seen this vision with the Lord and it is that that the throne room of God is filled with the host of heaven, which we know are angels, and God poses a question to Micaiah in this vision, and he says, who will go and bring Ahab down into the battle?  that he may fall, be defeated by Jabesh Gilead?  And so they were all discussing this, and you can see the verse of scripture, and finally one says, I can.  So God says, how would you do this?  He said, I would be to them a lying spirit.  And I would go upon them in lying spirit and draw them into the battle.  And that's when I heard the Lord say, this is exactly what's happening in the media.  I have released a lying spirit.  So, my theology is saying, God, you don't have a lying spirit.  Of course.  And so, how would this thing be?  It just doesn't match up with that.  But it's there.  But it's there.  It's there.  I can't deny that those scriptures are there.  So he goes down and he becomes a lying spirit in the mouth of the prophets that Jezebel had been feeding at her table.  And table is fellowship and communion.  They're hearing all of this demonic stuff.  And so they're spewing all these things out.  And so he comes down to the battle and he's defeated.  right then.  Here is the significant part that I heard the Lord say, I'm in charge of this and I'm the one that's allowing them to hear all this demonic stuff.  Do not be disturbed by what you hear by poll numbers and and who's doing this and they're behind the scenes and all of this conspiracy theory.  And there may be an element of truth, but even two percent truth with 98 percent poison is rat poison.  Of course.  So why even subject ourselves into any of that?  So when he said, I'm in charge of this and I'm going to allow them to fill up these bowls, bowls of iniquity.  And so then when I raise up my servant Trump with a high hand, it will literally show the lying spirit for what they are.  And people's eyes are going to be open and truth is going to come in.  Truth is not just what we hear, but truth is what we see done.  And there is a release of the spirit of truth that's coming on our land.  that's going to destroy this lying spirit that has been filtering through the minds and hearts of people.  It will be as like 2 Corinthians 4, the God of this world hath blinded their eyes.  Now, so now the spirit of truth is going to open their eyes to see the reality of what God's doing. ",

He was having Shekinah, meaning the environment of the presence, but then the Lord becoming the mantle himself upon him.  And when he saw that, he began to have the brokenness.  Who am I?  I'm undone.  And so then God begins to send him and give him assignments.  But it's in that moment where I realized that this glory of the Lord covering the sea, the nations, the weightiness of God Himself will be in such a way that people will have visions and dreams and experiences with God Himself, Yahweh, to where I'm the God of your fathers and turn to the Lord.  in one moment, in one instance.  And then part of our grafting in is that the other nations will begin to experience even a greater glory to all.  Right now, we're good.  I enjoy the presence of God and we get it at times.  But just think what it would be when our brothers, the Jews, the covenant people, the circumcision of God comes and the weightiness of God comes.  How much more will the rest of the world inhabit that? ",
