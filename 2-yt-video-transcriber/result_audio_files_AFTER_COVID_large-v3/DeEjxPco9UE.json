            "text": "Hello everyone, happy Sunday.  I love you and I'm sending you such a huge virtual hug right now, wherever you are on the earth plane.  I've got a message for you that came in a couple of days ago from my guides.  It's a little bit of an interesting message, like you may be able to hold it and you may not be able to hold it.  So if it totally does not resonate, just keep going and pass this video up.  But if it does resonate, I encourage you to start to really digest what came through.  so a couple of days ago my guides showed me like physically as well as told me that there is a huge amount of high frequency light that is being almost like injected into our air and into the atmosphere right now like a Imagine that we, the human population, the human experience on the earth plane is in a bubble and there's like these needles coming through the bubble and injecting us, not us physically, but injecting our air and this whole atmosphere with this high frequency light.  And they're almost not laughing in a weird, in a bad way, but they're smiling or chuckling because they are combating or overlaying all of the nonsense or darker consciousnesses lower vibrational consciousnesses that we're dismantling right now.  so it's almost like no matter what is coming up in our external it's being basically blocked like it's not able to have the impact it's designed to have because of how much high frequency light is literally seeping into our lungs.  so I want to also state that if you don't believe in light beings, I encourage you to begin to think about what you do believe in.  Do you believe in a higher power?  Do you believe in a God?  Do you believe in soul or spirit?  Do you believe in angels?  What is it that you believe in that you can actually hold that is bigger than this human journey right now, bigger than this physicality that you're standing in, because there is much more out there beyond this physical reality, this physical existence that we're in.  And you and I are not physicality, right?  We are higher consciousness, we're energy, we're light.  And so what is it that you can actually hold so that you can start to hold that this may actually be true?  Why are we not able to hold that reality, right?  What is blocking us from saying, oh my God, I can hold that.  I can hold that there is literally injections of high frequency light coming in to this air that I'm breathing and it's moving into my lungs physically, right?  Ask yourself why you can't hold that.  It's just a question to think about, right?  Because it's actually happening.  It's happening right now.  And I encourage you to think about how you've been feeling energetically the last couple of days.  Have you been sort of high?  Has your body been feeling more like energized?  Has your body been feeling more lethargic?  Has your body been having these weird palpitations or heat flashes?  Have you been staying up really late at night?  Have you been waking up in the middle of the night and staying up for a couple of hours?  Has your diet changed the last couple of days?  So this is just started about four days ago, five to six days ago, somewhere like the beginning of the week.  And so have you noticed anything different in you, right?  Because there is massive amounts of high frequency light injected into our air and into this physical atmosphere right now.  And you may not be able to see it because we live in a physical reality, a physical world, but it's absolutely unequivocally occurring right now and you're breathing it in.  Here's the key, it's a choice.  It's a choice to believe what I'm saying.  Period.  It's that simple.  You get to choose the reality that you're going to stand in.  And here's what they said to me this morning when I sat down in meditation.  They said, everything is on course.  You are all creating heaven on earth in this now moment.  You are all creating heaven on earth in this now moment.  And it is a choice to believe that when you are standing in the midst of the dismantling of that which is not heaven on earth.  We have to dismantle that which is not heaven on earth in order to create and be in heaven on earth.  We do not leave it behind.  We do not leave any of this dark behind.  Do you understand?  We don't step out of it and say, see you later.  We dismantle it so that it dissolves because we are not leaving this physical earth plane.  This physical earth plane and ourselves are shifting in this now.  All of it's shifting together.  We don't jump off and go somewhere else.  We do it right here, right now, which is what we're doing.  We are creating the heaven on earth.  So here's what they want you to know.  This is what I wrote down.  Dark is dissolving right now.  Light is consuming the planet and all beings and forms on it right now.  Hearts are opening in the millions right now.  Consciousness is raising in the human collective and the earth plane right now.  And humanity is shifting right now.  These are the five things they wanted me to tell you.  And they wanted me to remind you on top of the fact that we are being injected into our air, high frequency light, breathe it in.  I live in Northern California.  There is so much smoke in the air.  And they said to me, dear one, There is light in that smoke.  Your body is increasing in frequency in that smoke.  It's a choice how you want to view the external reality.  How do you want to view your reality?  You're that powerful.  You get to actually choose.  You get to choose.  Because the beings that I work with are much more powerful than any scientist or any famous person or any politician.  They know much more.  They're more advanced.  They understand physical reality.  They understand the quantum field.  They understand how energy works.  And most scientists, famous people, and politicians aren't there yet.  You're a highly advanced being of light in physical form trying to remember this.  Choose your reality.  Choose to know that what you are breathing in is light, high frequency light that is impacting your body in a positive way, allowing you to increase in frequency and shift into higher states of consciousness right now.  The dark is dissolving.  lights consuming the planet and all beings and forms on it.  Millions of hearts are opening right now.  Consciousness is raising right now and humanity is shifting.  I love you.  Be gentle with yourself.  Be gentle with all other beings and humans out there.  Give yourself more love, more compassion and more empathy.  We are doing this together.  I love you. ",
