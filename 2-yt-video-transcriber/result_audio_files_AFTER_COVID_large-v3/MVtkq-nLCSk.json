            "text": "Oh man, that's so wrong and it's worldly.  Let me finish this stand update with some words from John Calvin, who was a theologian and a pastor, who's commenting on Jesus' words to the Pharisees in Luke 6, verses 24-26.  He says, \"...woe to you who are rich, for you have received your consolation.  Woe to you who are full now, for you shall be  hungry.\".  Woe to you who laugh now, for you shall mourn and weep.  Woe to you when all people speak well of you, for so their fathers did to the false  prophets.\".  And then Calvin says this about that passage.  He says, We might think it harsh and puzzling that the rich, the comfortably well-off, and the happy should be condemned.  Now that's not what our Lord is saying here.  What He is condemning is the attitude of those who intent on living well in this world as so stupid and senseless as to forget there is a heavenly kingdom.  The life for believers may be easy today, but they will be ready tomorrow to endure whatever afflictions God may send them.  He may, perhaps, take from them the goods He has given.  they are prepared to surrender them, since they know they received them on one condition, that they should hand them back over whenever God should choose.  This is how we are to interpret the woes spoken against the rich, the satisfied, those who laugh and are glad.  Remember Job, who amidst his suffering proclaimed, If we have received good things from God's hand, why should we not also receive the bad?  We see then that although God may spare us and give us reason to rejoice, we should also expect to receive both good and bad from His hand, not reluctantly or because we are compelled, but meekly and cheerfully, obedient to His will.  for He must rule us, not according to our own likes, but according to what He knows is best and most expedient for us.  We are confident that all things will work for our salvation.  That is our motive for rejoicing.  We are taught then to pass through this world as strangers, convinced, as Paul says, that those who have should be as those who have not.  No one would deny that those who have plenty to live on meet many more temptations and run more risk of failing.  They need, therefore, to turn constantly to God and to learn that His gifts are meant to draw them closer to Him, to quicken their love and to encourage their obedience.  The good things they receive must never bewitch them to the point that they become captives to the world.  The prosperity gospel of Rodney and Jonathan sounds a lot more like the world than the promises we find in Scripture.  And here's one such promise and also a warning to any who are embracing this prosperity gospel.  1 Timothy 6 verses 6 through 10, But godliness with contentment is great gain, for we brought nothing into the world, and we can take nothing out of the world.  But if we have food and clothing, with these we will be content.  But those who desire to be rich fall into temptation, into a snare, into many senseless and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction.  For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil.  It is through this craving that some have wandered away from the faith and have pierced themselves with many  pangs.\". ",
