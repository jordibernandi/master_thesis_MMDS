Everyone keeps saying it's out of whack, historically out of whack.  It has to go back to 16 to one, 12 to one, et cetera.  It's ready to close that gap.  It's ready to, you should double down on silver.  I've been hearing it for years.  And obviously with 123 to one, but on the flip side, Jeff, I've never seen a trade work well when everyone's just buying one side of the sentiment.  What do you think of this? ",

            "text": "Well, you know, I mean, this has been a trade that's been building for so long that, you know, I don't think you should be quite as alarmed as seeing sentiment, you know, sort of lining up more and more squarely on one side.  because there's just no fundamental factors that can support this phony pricing.  And it starts with the characterization by the mainstream media and the bankers that silver is, quote unquote, an industrial metal.  And this is fundamentally wrong.  And the myth is perpetrated primarily through the way they characterize demand for silver.  I don't know how familiar your audience is with the silver market.  In terms of physical silver, precious metals continue to be dominated mostly by India.  I mean, there's tremendous amount of demand in China, in Russia for gold and some other areas.  But India has traditionally been the market for precious metals.  And of course, India has this massive peasant population approaching one billion people with basically no access to banking services.  So for this peasant population, they don't conduct their lives in paper rupees entirely.  Of course, they use it for some commerce.  But their wealth is typically worn personally around their necks in the form of gold and silver jewelry.  And so in India, jewelry, especially for the peasant population, is not an industrial good.  It's not some luxury good.  It's their savings account.  For instance, in 2018, when demand spiked in India, by itself, India imported one-third of all the silver mined on the planet.  And of course, the vast majority of that went to the jewelry market for monetary purposes, not industrial purposes.  And so you put that together with the investment demand in the West, the monetary demand in terms of minted coins and that, and the total demand for silver still stacks very closely to 50-50 or even weighted more towards the investment precious metal side.  The fact that silver is such a tremendously useful metal in a variety of industrial contexts doesn't make it less precious.  It makes it more precious. ",

Oil prices in America measured by the West Texas Intermediate benchmark.  yesterday with the expiry of the May contracts, it traded even as low as minus $40.  Obviously, no storage facilities.  We all know the story.  You have to go to Cushing in Oklahoma to get to get it.  People were naked on it.  And now it's straight for like two bucks.  The Brent is, which is used in Europe, Middle East and Africa is like $20 a barrel.  So obviously, and there's an April 30th expiry for that option.  So we'll see what happens with there.  But what are some of the ramifications of what we're seeing right now? ",

            "text": "Well, of course, it speaks in general to the weakness of the global economy.  And not just post-COVID.  You know, we have to look back to, you know, pre-pandemic.  And generally the weak demand picture in the global oil market.  And primarily weak demand in the West.  And in the West, even particularly weak demand in the U.S You know, so there's been all of this media hype for the last 12 years about the quote-unquote U.S.  recovery.  And I've previously raised a lot of questions about the actual existence of this recovery.  For one thing, there's been no new jobs created.  That's obvious if you look at the civilian participation report that the Federal Reserve puts out.  But the other thing that's remarkable is that oil demand peaked in the  U.S.,  and it's actually below previous peak levels from earlier years.  periods of growth.  So, you know, my question, whenever I hear talk about the quote unquote US recovery is, you know, what sort of economic recovery can you have that consumes less oil?  You know, so, so, so there's, there's, there was the starting structural problem of demand weakness, particularly with the Western economies.  And then there was underperformance in a lot of the emerging economies.  A lot of it to do with, with the, low levels of the currencies we're trading at, which acts as a tax on the economies.  So we had this depressed demand picture.  Then COVID strikes with inventories extremely robust.  And all of a sudden, you've got these massive flows of oil based on projections for world demand that haven't been materializing because these demand projections have been inflated.  And so then you have a shock where there's basically all the supply coming on the market and a plunge in demand.  And boom, the supply capacity gets used up very quickly.  So this is obviously going to be a crisis for the oil industry over the immediate months until something close to normal resumes for the global economy.  But even once we have something like normalcy again, I think there's going to be some structural problems with the oil industry for the foreseeable future. ",

Oil is not under the control of the American Central Bank or something.  It's not only a global commodity, which can't be that easily maneuvered, it's also a very political one.  So it takes a lot of countries to get something together there.  I want to ask you, what do you think are the ramifications of the Federal Reserve and what they're doing with buying treasuries, obviously buying ETFs and junk bonds, buying basically the entire Russell 2000 debt?  What does this mean for investors?  What is this? ",

            "text": "Well, I guess two ways to answer that.  First of all, You know, what we saw in the 2008 financial crisis was the Federal Reserve and Western Central Banks panicking and engaging in all of these unprecedented credit and monetary operations that were far more reckless than anything we've ever seen in the history of our monetary system.  And now, you know, what we've seen with the COVID pandemic is essentially that same level of panic almost multiplied by an order of magnitude.  Federal Reserve is doing more of everything it was doing in 2008.  It's doing it faster.  And of course, as you mentioned, it's launched these even more extreme asset purchase programs and credit facility programs that just go so far beyond anything that would have been contemplated prior to 2008.  And we've entered into this surreal monetary world where crazy interest rates uh, insane levels of money printing, uh, are treated by the myopic mainstream media as being normal.  And of course there was nothing at all normal about interest rates or, or monetary policies before COVID.  Uh, and again, you know, uh, people are focusing on, on the panic and what's happened since then, but you know, uh, some very smart people were already looking at the U S financial system and the federal reserve operations pre COVID, uh, in particular, the feds, uh, extreme level, suddenly an extreme level of activity in the repo market.  So, you know, altogether now, the Federal Reserve has pumped somewhere around $8 trillion into repo operations, but like $5 trillion of that was all done well before COVID ever appeared on the radar of financial markets.  So there was obviously, well, I mean, there's two ways of looking at it.  There was either obviously some major stresses in the U.S.  financial system that were kind of below visibility that the Federal Reserve is addressing towards the latter part of 2019 and the first part of 2020.  Alternately, if you have listeners that are more conspiracy minded, you have to ask yourself if the Federal Reserve was preparing back in September for the COVID pandemic. ",

            "text": "Well, let me ask you about the COVID pandemic because obviously it's everything that everyone cares about right now and they should care about it.  Was it and is it handled correctly?  So much studies are out there right now that are saying, hey, we over blew the severity of this.  The exponential growth of patients could be You know, could be something that infects everyone, but the number of people on ventilators and the number of severe patients and deaths is linear.  It's not exponential.  That is what a lot of these models are.  If we open up the economy and get herd immunity and just protect our high-risk groups, it seems like we will get a better result because we will not have a second wave.  And obviously, all the young people will do their part to kill the virus.  But I want to ask you, do you think this is even correct?  What is your research on this?  And what do you think will happen right now when they reopen the economy?  How bad would the depression be? ",

            "text": "Well, there's still so much uncertainty about the true nature of the virus itself.  But three factors, once I looked more closely at the scenario, three factors troubled me significantly.  A, this is a particularly contagious virus.  It has above average contagious factor.  It also has an abnormally long incubation period.  The medical literature is saying incubation can take at least up to 14 days.  I've seen some reports that it can be as long as, you know, 21 days.  And so, you know, that is problematic because, you know, unless you're doing, you know, almost universal testing, it means that, you know, it can spread invisibly.  And of course, exacerbating that is there's a significant but unknown percentage of asymptomatic carriers.  So you put those three factors together, And it makes containment extremely difficult.  As to whether the policy responses have been correct, that's another variable we can't answer today because we don't truly understand the mortality rate.  For instance, where I live in British Columbia, only a tiny sliver of the population is being tested.  So we know that the official case count is only a fraction of the overall number of people infected.  But is it a fraction in terms of 1% or 1 in 1,000 or 1 in 10,000?  That's something that nobody can put their finger on at the moment.  Anecdotally, I have some contacts in the medical profession who insist that this is the real deal in terms of the severity of the virus.  It is extremely taxing the resources of the medical system, even in countries that aren't at true extreme levels of infection.  The one other factor that needs to be put into context is the so-called herd immunity.  So at this point, I'm hearing extremely mixed reports as to whether, in fact, people automatically develop immunity.  There's a lot of anecdotal reports about people having cases recur, whether this is reactivation or reinfection.  People who were diagnosed with COVID, but then are not displaying any antibodies in their system.  So, you know, the assumption of herd immunity could be extremely dangerous if, in fact, there's not the normal and expected level of antibody development that shields people from reinfection. ",

And there I got to work with a lot of public companies, a lot of mining companies, got a lot more in touch with the mining side of the business.  But then, you know, towards the latter part of 2019, myself and a couple of partners decided that, you know, precious metals was looking very interesting again.  And so we started making plans to, you know, get back into that on an active basis, actually just before sort of COVID came around.
