These individuals, I don't know what reason they're coming together to be a force or consider themselves a militia, but they are a group of misfits, people who never were tactically inclined and could never join the police department or the military, maybe not efficiently.  And then they're a part of a coalition run by a guy named Grandmaster Jay.  Now, I'm making this video.  Because this is the dumbest organization on planet Earth.  Not just because their mission is ignorant.  It's because the fact they do not have any tactical experience to the point at which they're embarrassing themselves in front of the world.  Riddle me this.  People of color can't get their stuff together.  How is a black organization that's supposed to be comprised of all these tactical individuals keep making blunders?  Now we're gonna walk through a few of those blunders and I'm gonna tell you why.  Grandmaster J have no idea.  what he's talking about as it relates to firearms and the AR-15.  First and foremost, the NFAC, where did they start their mission and their militia at?  They started in a place where they claimed that the Ku Klux Klan was at in Georgia.  Nobody even heard of the Ku Klux Klan anymore.  They're irrelevant.  I've never in my life seen somebody walking around with a pillowcase on their head.  Not for 100 years.  Now, I'm exaggerating, but you get what I'm saying.  Now, what's the second place they go?  To support Breonna Taylor, who's just sleeping in her bed.  Not that that wasn't true.  Watch my videos, you know that it wasn't true.  It was unfortunate what happened to her.  But she wasn't just sleeping in the bed, an innocent woman that needs justice because the police were so wrong.  That's not that situation.  Anyway, they go to Kentucky to protest.  Back before, on one of their other protests, one of the guy had a jam round in his AR.  I don't know what he was doing.  I don't know if there was a .22 or whatever.  He had a jam round in there, walking around looking like an idiot.  Then this time, at Breonna Taylor's little protest thing, one guy ended up shooting himself and a few other people because they have no idea what they're talking about with guns.  Now, I believe this video derived from Grandmaster J having to try to go out and defend his idiotic team who is... discharging the gun on each other on accident.  So he gets on a video.  For those of you who don't know me, I'm a former police officer and I was on a SWAT team, so I know what I'm talking about.  And for other people who know about firearms, this guy made it sound like, or he insinuated, that when the boat carrier comes forward, when the boat is driven forward, that that's firing the rifle.  That's firing the AR-15.  That's gonna cause a discharge that's gonna shoot you in the face.  That's got to be the dumbest thing that I've ever heard in my life.  But I'm going to play his video so you can see exactly what he said.  And then I'm going to disprove him unequivocally.  Roll the film.  This is my first weapon that I ever bought.  I bought this weapon back in 1990.  The interesting thing about this weapon is if I pull back the bolt... See that?  See the bolt?  There's no bullet in there.  Pay very close attention.  If I'm not paying attention and I take this weapon and I bang it, look what just happened.  The bolt goes forward.  The weapon has fired.  I didn't touch the trigger.  I just simply banged it on the table.  Can y'all believe what that man just said?  See, I would be cool if they had their little militia or whatever, but man, you cannot be this incompetent and running around arrogant.  See, when arrogance turns into ignorance, that's when you have a problem, ladies and gentlemen.  He has no idea what he's talking about when it comes to an AR-15.  So let me demonstrate for you.  My AR-15 is on safe.  You can see it right here.  It says safe, right?  The bolt is forward.  There's no round in the chamber.  This is a full mag.  So my gun is in the safe position, ready to be charged.  We call it charged.  So what I'm gonna do is hold a bow carrier back, which is, I wouldn't recommend people hold a gun like that, but if you can do that, then you can lock it forward.  So anyway, I'm gonna run the bow carrier back.  The bow carrier's locked back.  You see the rounds in the magazine here.  The bow carrier's here.  He claims that if you bang it on the ground with the round in it, it's gonna fire the weapon.  I just banged it.  It did not fire the weapon.  The boat carrier and the boat is not going to fire the weapon.  It's called the pen, the firing pen that's in there.  If I took the rifle apart, you'll see it.  There's a firing pen in there.  When you pull the trigger, the firing pen hits the back of the bullet, which causes an explosion, and it makes the bullet come out the barrel.  Now, if his theory was correct, and if the bow carrier moving forward is going to cause the gun to go off, then every time you do this, then that means that the gun is going to go off.  Now, obviously, it had a mechanical jam in there.  You can see the jam.  I'll fix it later.  But you get what I'm saying.  This guy has no idea what he's talking about when it comes to a firearm.  He has no idea.  And how is he leading a movement?  How is he going to be the leader and the trusted one?  I mean, the government should shut these people down.  I mean, in my personal opinion, I mean, if they're out here threatening people with firearms, they should be.  Because they're no different than any other domestic terrorist group.  But he has no idea what he's talking about.  When the bolt carrier moves forward, that ejects the round and it loads the other round in.  Ejects, loads the other round.  Ejects, loads the other round.  If that simply moving forward is going to fire the round, then the thing will just fire automatically without you pulling the trigger.  How do you not know that?  And he's supposed to be in the military.  He's supposed to be a tactical instructor.  And these people are here acting in good faith.  Come on, cuz.  Come on, cuz.  Just admit it.  You don't know nothing about firearms and you out here just virtue signaling.  So anyway, I had to make that video to disprove these fools who run around thinking they're tactical, thinking they know what they're talking about.  They know nothing about nothing from nothing.  So ladies and gentlemen, let me know.  Any of you firearm people out there, write a comment in the comment section.  Let me know.  Is B Tatum tripping?  Do I not know what I'm talking about?  Or am I on to something?  Now, I could do this for two or three hours and talk about these idiotic people who claim to be tactical and they're not, who claim to be leaders and they're not, who claim to have a militia but it's actually a terrorist group.  I could talk about them all day, but I want you to watch the rest of my videos.  So make sure you write a comment, like and subscribe to the channel, visit tatumreport.com.  You can get all your cool merch there.  Y'all know what it is.  I'll see you on the next one.  I'm out. ",
