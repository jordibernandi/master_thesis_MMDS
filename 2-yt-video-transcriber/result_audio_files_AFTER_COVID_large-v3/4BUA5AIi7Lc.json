And if you ever want me to host a group or any group like that in your area, or even virtually, if you get a group of people together, I'll be absolutely down to do it.  But again, So I'm talking to these women, you know, it's a, it's a women's group on relationships.  And the reason that these women have come is that they feel like they're getting older.  You know, these women in particular were all 38 years old.  Um, these women that I'm going to talk about right now. ",

The notorious, magnanimous Replicant Fish.  Well, I hope you're doing well.  Hope you've had a nice week.  Only a few more days till the end of the year.  And yeah, no one cares.  Could be exciting.  But I have a video today of women talking or complaining, if you will, more like complaining about about being over 35 and having no kids and no man.  Now some would say immediately leftover women.  Xiongnu.  Yeah, Xiongnu.  Which in China means an unmarried woman above the age of 27.  Because in China, their wall is 27.  It's not 30.  Like in the West, we're quite modest.  And in some parts of Europe, it's 25, you know, cut off date for a woman to not be married.  For some, a woman over 35 is with no kids looking for a man to have kids with it's trash already trash you know.  it's not really appealing really.  you know to have a relationship with that's different but to start a family with at that age it's like i've got problems.  yeah what have you been doing for the past 15 plus years of your life that you didn't think?  to start this sooner?  you have to have many many men if i want to sell my.  what's the problem?  but then again obviously career and whatnot.  and yeah but enough waffling enough waffling.  you're not here for this.  let's begin.

Some men should understand there are many women who get to their 30s, even 40s without ever having a proper relationship.  What they have are just extended f-buddies, f-boys, just casual relationships.  Not the full girlfriend thing that some men would think of if they've been a girlfriend.  No, no, they've been just kind of like a proper garden tool, bang toy for certain men for most of their adult life.  And then they want to get married.  It's a strange but beautiful thing to watch is how women don't seem to think they burn themselves out.  I think a lot of women actually do know they burn themselves out, but it's the naive thought they have that men don't notice that you're not as good as you used to be or that you probably was years ago.  Why would I want to marry you now?  I'll have fun with you, yes.  Have fun.  But anything serious?  No.  Especially if, as a woman, you haven't had anything serious before.  What makes you think I will be the chump, captain, to save you?  Bullshit.  Former garden tool.  Just saying, she probably wasn't, but nowadays, nowadays, be careful. ",

So many women don't seem to get this and I'm not going to lie.  It's okay.  That's fine.  That's fine.
