            "text": "It's a constant sticking point.  I mean, you see these people that agree with us on 90 percent of things, but they just won't touch.  They won't touch race or they won't touch national identity.  And at the same time as they are decrying many of the things we decry, they don't see it as a problem at all that capitalism is is forcing this mass immigration on people against the democratic will.  And I mean.  that's kind of a source of despair.  I mean, you know, you look at these intelligent sort of distant left types that are very much against the establishment, very much against the mainstream left and the radical liberal types.  But at the same time, they'll just never go there on race.  They'll just never go there on national identity or on the democratic will against immigration.  And I mean, it seems like the only explanation for that is that they still have an element of liberalism that they don't care to admit.  And that, you know, that is the sticking point, because I know you're talking about we can make some kind of alliance with the left, we can win over leftists.  And, you know, you and I are both former leftists, so we know that there's obviously a pathway there.  But at the same time, it's like, is there any, there doesn't seem to be a viable way to get these people to even touch the race issue. ",

            "text": "Yeah, you know, that's surprising as I Always found it a bit weird when, you know, people like Amy Therese are overrated in our circles a little bit because when she's criticizing like Vogue ideology and neoliberalism, it sounds a lot like the criticisms we make.  But what's behind it is what I came to reject Marxism in the first place.  at the very beginning of this call was that it shares the same ontology with liberalism.  In fact, Marx was heavily influenced by the Scottish Enlightenment.  It's the same idea that man is malleable and he's malleable because of the economic conditions that he finds himself in.  Essentialist notions of race, even if Marx had some race comments, in principle are denied by Marxism.  So even he himself might have said some things in principle.  what the main ontology of dialectical materialism is, is that what creates man is the material conditions.  All these antagonisms can be solved if we just solve the problem of the way in which people don't have access to material resources as upper classes do.  And so this is why I came to reject it, because it postulated that, which I think is a false view of man to begin with.  And then it postulates this idea that, you know, if we solve this problem, then everyone, there's going to be essentially a state of harmony, right?  That's what communism is.  It's a stateless, classless society.  And so I'm always a little skeptical of this idea of allying with the left.  I more or less take the approach that whoever likes what I have to say or what you have to say, whether they be from the left or right, they can come along for the ride.  But at the end of the day, we're doing our own thing.  And I'll say about people like Zizek, for example, Zizek should really just be a fascist.  Because if you look at what his main point is, his point is that when he puts it this way, I'll say it this way because it's the easiest way to say it, is that traditionally the father figure would just say, you're going to your grandparents whether you like it or not.  While the postmodern dad would say, you're going to your grandparents because you're going to love it.  Right.  It tries to make you enjoy this process.  So the formalized authoritative figure is no longer present, which is very much true.  This goes back to what we're talking about before.  We have this great neoliberal system in which this flowing of capital is mismanaged by a variety of spectators and institutional actors and educators and presidents and the  U.N.,  And none of them are taking responsibility for it.  It's effectively being treated like a system outside of our control.  It's propped up like a collective fiction.  So what, well, not like, it is a collective fiction.  And so what Zizek, his point is we need to return to this authority figure.  We need to actually have a stated role of the state and putting a stop to this dominance of economic rationality.  And so in his point, he should really just be a fascist.  right and so with people like zizek you do.  we do have more of a common ground with but for the majority of marxists and zizek of course is more of a hey gillian even though he gets painted as a marxist.  it's more because of his critique of ideology.  but regardless marxists are still caught up in the same enlightenment ontology.  they get it from the exact same source and at the end of the day they're still denying the fundamental importance about who we are.  And that's really what the dissident right and the alt-right in its heyday was about.  It was asking the question of identity.  It was asking who we are.  And it was asking about it in terms of race, in terms of religion, in terms of the fact that these things actually matter and just trying to prop up an economic utopia, which is the same thing that conservatives actually have in common with Marxists more than they have in common with us.  In the sense that they simply think ordering the economy a bit differently than the Marxists is going to bring about the result of, you know, everyone's free, right?  Everyone's happy.  It's the same thing at the end of the day.  And so really, the only ones questioning the entire ontology of this world system is really us.  And I think these are questions that we need to keep pushing because it's any kind of Marxist account simply is not a strong enough bulwark.  It's a part of the system, and I'm just as opposed to it as I am opposed to capitalism. ",

            "text": "You actually gave the same answer that I gave when I was asked recently about the kind of dissident left-alt-right alliance, because I kind of disagreed with Spencer.  Spencer said something along the lines of, you know, well, we'll have to give up something and the distant left will have to give up something and then we can potentially meet in the middle.  But my attitude was much more, you know, when people ask about the potentially aligned with these people and they say, well, you know, look at how these figures that you think are going to come to our side, they still won't touch the race question or look at this example of them peddling anti-white stuff.  And yeah, my attitude is the same as you.  It's like, yeah, we're not going to win these people over.  We're not going to win over the kind of dissident left journalist on Twitter that's been doing this stuff for like 20 years.  We're not going to win over Amy Therese or these people.  But yeah, my approach is the same as you.  It's like, no, we won't compromise.  We won't meet them in the middle, but we have potential to win over people that would otherwise go to them.  So the next generation of those people, the people now that are becoming alienated from liberalism, that when they're looking for a radical alternative, that instead of the options being this kind of, you know, racist conservatism versus the dissident left perspective, which maybe has a better structural analysis on some things, that they will have the option of racialist third position that can explain the economic alienation they're looking at and can explain the source of many of the structural problems just as well as the dissident left.  without us having to compromise on race and without us having to compromise on those elements of our identity.  And I think that is very doable.  And I think that actually we probably do have more potential to win people from there rather than conservatism.  And if not more people, then probably better people in terms of what their motivations are and in terms of what they're looking for.  But, you know, it's actually interesting.  you mentioned Amy Trees because it was just this week I saw her on Twitter.  She got into it with kind of, some of our guys, and she said to one of them that they had a completely liberal ontology because they included race as well as class as a factor.  And she said that, you know, that position implies that racial categories are primordial or that they exist outside of history rather than the historical materialist Marxist perspective.  that racial categories are ascribed in accordance with ruling class interests.  Now, that sounds to me like a fairly muddied explanation in that it's kind of a, I see what you think of it, but I think it's kind of a sleight of hand trick in that it's like, well, you know, people didn't discuss race in this way before a capitalist epoch.  And therefore, it can be explained due to class interests and therefore in a communist society or post-capitalism that the importance of race would diminish.  But it's like at the same time, you know, we didn't always understand things like calculus and it's like she seems to be just doing a kind of sleight of hand trick there or a kind of genetic fallacy and that it's like, well, this is historically how we came to knowledge of these things or this is how racial identities kind of came into conflict or got an awareness of themselves in a globalized context and so how we developed a language around it.  and therefore it's historically contingent it's completely contingent whereas really it's like well maybe the origin of those individual categories are contingent and yeah maybe they came out of an embedded social context where you know various class interests and so on played a role in the way they were the way they were discussed, but at the same time, there can still be a material reality of race there.  And, you know, if you are a dialectical materialist, then biology and genetic factors are, you would imagine, just as much a part of your material analysis.  You know, if you're not a dualist and you don't see, you know, you don't see humans as being on some separate ontological plane to the world they inhabit, then, you know, surely race and genetics should be a part of your materialist kind of deterministic outlook on the world.  Would you agree with that? ",

            "text": "Yeah, I do.  I should think I replied to that tweet.  Yeah, it was an interesting sleight of hand.  It was also, when it comes to history of philosophy, very ignorant.  What I found interesting about that is like, It's the same thing with like, you know, Marx having said racist comments and liberals having like historically 18th century and on using a lot of racial understanding to justify certain colonialist activities.  Right.  That doesn't mean, therefore, that these racial categories are purely historically contingent and don't fit into the analysis.  So like what I was saying earlier is I was saying like.  The way in which neoliberalism weaponizes ethnic resentment as a part of its woke ideology does not therefore mean that that racial awareness is not real or that race isn't real.  They come from a real place.  And you have to be able to look to all these various different influences that actually play a role in bringing about these antagonisms.  And you have to deal with the fact that they do matter.  Marxism tries to prop up, like I was saying before, this malleable view of man.  It's why it tends to fall into these historicist misunderstandings that it does.  It's like Amy's response there, perfectly exemplified.  So if you look at like the foundation of liberalism, they had, when it came about, they had coffee houses and salons and all that.  And those were considered places where people exercise the use of public reason, which were in principle meant to be open to everybody.  The actual historical reality of that, though, while they were claiming in principle that everybody has access to the same universal reasoning powers and rationality, and we could come to purely secular universal principles of justice, for example, is they were, of course, excluded to women and minorities and things like that.  But just because of the fact that the historical circumstance does not negate the fact that the principle of liberalism was always about universal rationality and about people having the exact same capabilities at reaching these principles and then constructing society around these principles.  And Marxism, of course, has a similar understanding when it comes to malleability and economic conditions.  It simply prioritized these conditions and propped up a historicism in which we could, if we think the conditions in which these antagonisms come, we could change the nature and then we could ultimately reformulate man away from alienation.  And so they share a similar root in the sense that both of them are ontologies of of tabula rosa of blank slate of malleable man.  While the third position, this one is of course that race is real and that it matters and that it plays a functional role in our explanations.  And it's something that is, it's not a part of identity.  You could throw away and expect everything to be perfectly okay from that.  You know, it's a part of alienation and capitalist alienation in particular.  that racial categories and awareness are being denied to white people and that has obvious obvious effects if you look around the world right now.  so it's.  it's in the sense then that allying with the left is simply impossible because you'd be giving up the foundation of what makes our worldview distinct from theirs.  i do think in some ways Like when it comes to our show EBL, we've had a lot of good reaction from leftist philosophers, including like a Zero Books author and that have wanted to open up dialogue with us, which I think is good.  I mean, really, at the end of the day, what we're trying to do is poach an audience.  I'm not trying to give away the goat, but we're trying to present our case and we're trying to present it by talking to people outside of our sphere.  But there's no sense in which we're actually talking.  unironically adopting these ideologies and somehow hoping to secret squirrel our own worldview in there.  That is just naive, right?  But what we're trying to do is open up this dialogue and present the strength of our worldview against theirs.  And that could only be done by being willing to not ghettoize yourself and not get caught up in purity spirals and Conservative baggage.  You have to be willing to engage the world, but you have to do it critically.  You have to know where Marxism came from and you have to be willing to call out, say, Amy Therese when she makes a classic mistake when it comes to the history of philosophy and where the common root of both liberalism and Marxism stem from.
