Katie is saying, Romans also had gods for everything.  There is legit reason why both Romans and Hindus have so many gods.  It's cultural appropriation.  I don't know if that's true either, so I'm not going to comment on that.  Soraya is saying, very well said.  Thank you, Soraya.  What am I saying?
