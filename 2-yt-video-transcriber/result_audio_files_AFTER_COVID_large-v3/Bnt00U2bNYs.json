            "text": "Hi.  Today I want to talk to you about practical wisdom.  It's one of the most important virtues in Aristotle.  It plays a key role.  We've talked about Aristotle's conception of virtue, and in particular the idea that for Aristotle, as for Confucius, a virtue, at least a moral virtue as opposed to an intellectual virtue, a moral virtue, one concerned with action, is a mean between extremes.  There are, essentially, two ways of going wrong.  Now, with a lot of virtues, it feels as if there's only one way.  What's the opposite of honesty?  dishonesty?  What's the opposite of generosity?  Stinginess.  What's the opposite of sincerity?  Insincerity.  The opposite of kindness?  Unkindness.  And so on.  And so, our common sense conception tends to think there's really only one opposite to virtues, one way of going wrong, one side of things you have to worry about.  But Aristotle and Confucius say that's not true.  There are two sides, and so we have to be very careful.  Yes, you can be dishonest, not honest enough, in other words, but you could be, in effect, too honest.  Now, of course, they wouldn't put it that way because honesty they think of as a virtue.  And so when you become, well, as it were, too honest, you become what?  Rude?  Blunt?  something like that.  And the same thing is true with generosity.  Stinginess is not enough generosity, but you can, in effect, be too generous.  And again, they wouldn't quite put it that way.  Generosity is a virtue.  But that vice that involves too much of whatever that thing is, that becomes, well, indulgence, maybe.  And so, There are two ways of going wrong.  Now here's what's crucial about practical wisdom.  It's how you find that mean.  So one way to think of this is to think of the range of choices you have.  You might think of a virtue in either Aristotle or Confucius as something that constrains a basic human emotion or drive or maybe a collection of those things.  And it can constrain it too much or too little.  So we might think of there as being a spectrum here.  And Aristotle says, doing the right thing, being virtuous, is a matter of finding the mean there.  He talks as if it's a point, that mean.  Probably more realistically, it's something like a range.  What's the ideal response to somebody who's in need, for example?  Is there one thing you should do or amount you should give or something like that?  Maybe, but maybe it's really a range of things we would describe as virtuous things.  However that may be, whether it's a point or a range here, we're trying to find that.  And so we're trying to find the points at which we distinguish what is good, what is virtuous here.  from the things that involve vices.  If we constrain too little, we get, as it were, vice number one, I'll say.  That's the vice we normally think of, like dishonesty compared to honesty, or stinginess compared to generosity.  But then there is a second vice corresponding to these that involves going too far, doing too much in the other direction.  And so that would be like being rude or blunt, being indulgent.  and so on.  It would be a matter of actually going too far in what we'd normally think of as the virtuous direction.  Now typically, there is one side here that it's much easier to fall into than the other, which is why common sense focuses on that as the opposite.  Well, here's the idea.  Practical wisdom is what enables us to find those points, to find the mean, to understand what that point is or what that range is, so that we understand how to act.  Well, that makes it crucial.  It's very important to be able to do that.  Confucius describes this as knowledge.  We've got to know where to draw these lines.  But Aristotle's more specific. ",

They're such a thing as an excellence in an art.  This is instead a virtue.  That is to say, it is itself an excellence.  Practical wisdom is the excellence of being able to find that virtuous mean, and not falling too far in either direction.  We've got to know, Aristotle says, what to do in every situation.  We've got to know what the right thing is to do, and we've got to do it at the right time, in the right way, toward the right object.  and in the way that a virtuous person would do it.  It's very hard to do all of that.  How do we manage it?  Well, we have to know where to draw those lines and how to find that mean.  And that is itself a virtue. ",

            "text": "Here is how he defines it.  It's thought to be the mark of a man of practical wisdom to be able to deliberate well about what's good and expedient for himself, not in some particular respect, for example about what sorts of things conduce to health or to strength, but about what sorts of things conduce to the good life in general.  So people can be wise practically about all sorts of things.  Somebody may know what to do in order to stay healthy, or to build up strength, or how to solve plumbing problems, or how to fix your computer when things go wrong, and all sorts of things of that kind.  And that is a kind of virtue.  There's a kind of techne there, a kind of skill, a kind of technical wisdom involved.  But practical wisdom is the sort of generalized aspect of that.  It's something that lets us know what to do in all sorts of situations.  It's the person who is capable of deliberating, Aristotle says, that has practical wisdom, that understands enough about what is good to deliberate wisely and well.  Here's another characterization.  It is a true and reasoned state of capacity to act with regard to the things that are good or bad for human beings.  So it's a question of being able to recognize what's good and bad, what's valuable, and to what extent.  And how do I approach this particular problem in order to reflect that and get what is good?  Good action itself, Aristotle says, is the end.  It's for this reason that we think Pericles and others like him have practical wisdom.  Namely, because they see what's good for themselves and what's good for people in general.  So practical wisdom is something like the excellence involved in choosing the right thing.  Choosing not only what is valuable, but knowing how to accomplish something, how to do something, how in general to pursue the good for human beings. ",

            "text": "So it's a reason and true state of capacity to act with regard to human goods.  It is a capacity to act.  It is a capacity to actually do the right thing, to find the virtuous means between those extremes.  It's a very difficult thing to do.  And so, as he points out at one point, there are many different ways of going wrong.  There's really typically only one way, or at least a very limited set of ways, of going right.  Hard to do that.  Many ways to go wrong, hard to manage to find the right thing to do at the right time, in the right circumstances, toward the right object, to the right extent, and for the right reason.  Now here's part of what makes it so hard.  Aristotle says it's not just concerned with universals.  It is not something that involves, even though it does involve a general knowledge of what's good for human beings, it's not something that you can just get by on general knowledge with respect to.  No, you need to understand the particulars.  You are acting in a particular situation toward particular people.  And you've got to act in particular ways, in a particular social setting, at a particular time.  And all of those things complicate the picture.  So it's one thing to know some general rules about how to approach problems, about how to solve problems or things are good.  Oh, that's valuable.  But it's not enough.  We have to know the particulars and understand them as well.  So Aristotle tells us practical wisdom isn't just concerned with universals.  It's concerned with particulars.  It's got to recognize them.  It's practical.  and practice, actually acting in a certain situation in the world, requires particulars.  It requires particular knowledge of that situation.  Now, Aristotle draws, I think, some important lessons from this.  One is that ethical knowledge, while it's important in general, is not enough.  It's not enough.  You can study ethics all you want.  It doesn't make you a good person.  In fact, there's some empirical evidence that studying ethics can actually make you a worse person.  It's disturbing.  But why?  Well, because you get the impression you can substitute that kind of general knowledge for the particular understanding that's really required to be a good person.  To find that mean in a particular setting, I have to understand that setting.  I have to understand those circumstances, the particular people involved.  What will happen if I do this kind of thing in this particular circumstance?  And so I've got to understand the ways of the world, not just a general ethical theory about what's good, what's bad, what constitutes a virtue, and so forth.  All that knowledge is good, Aristotle said, but it's not enough.  And gaining it can tempt us to think it is enough.  And that's a serious mistake.  He says, look, that's why some who don't know, and especially those who have experience, are more practical than others who know.  That is to say, have theoretical knowledge.  It's characteristic of people with practical wisdom to have deliberated well.  Look at what they've decided.  Have they made good decisions?  Have they deliberated well?  Don't test them on theoretical knowledge of ethics.  Say in practice, do they do the right thing?  Have they deliberated well?  Have they actually accomplished good things?  Have they lived a good life?  That's what really matters in ethics.  Excellence in deliberation is going to end up being correctness with regard to what conduces to the end of which practical wisdom is the true apprehension.  In other words, you look at the person and say, well, are they doing the right thing?  Are they leading a good life?  Are they, in the end, virtuous?  And if they are, they are people of practical wisdom.  Whether or not they can tell you what they're doing, it's a question of finding that mean.  And there are lots of people who can find the mean but can't explain why.  Other people, yes, they approach it theoretically, and maybe they do approach the meme, and they find it effectively, and they can tell you why.  Good.  Good for them.  There are other people who can tell you all sorts of things about ethics, but can't actually in their own lives find the meme very well at all.  Aristotle says, yeah, those people may have a great deal of theoretical knowledge.  They don't have practical wisdom.  And the end for actually achieving the good and acting virtuously, this is what matters far more than any theoretical wisdom.  It matters that we have practical wisdom and be able to find the right thing to do in the right circumstances.  Well, Aristotle draws this corollary.  We ought to attend to the undemonstrated sayings and opinions of experienced and older people, or of people of practical wisdom, not less than to demonstrations, that is to say theories, about ethics or any other subject, because experience has given them an eye.  They see aright.  In other words, talk to people who you think of as leading a good life.  Talk to people you think of as wise.  and find out what they value.  Try to understand how they see the world.  They may not have much theoretical understanding.  They may not actually understand the depths of this and be able to give you lots of reasons for doing what they do or valuing what they value.  But in the end, the proof is in the pudding.  Look at how they live.  If they live well, that's something that tells you that person has practical wisdom and there's a lot to be learned from them.  So in ethics, Aristotle is saying, once we understand, from a theoretical point of view, what virtue is, and the importance of practical wisdom, of finding that meaning, we realize that actually theory in ethics is of secondary importance.  What really matters is that excellence, that excellence of finding the mean.  And although theory might help you find it, it's not going to be enough.  Moreover, it's not nearly as important as your ability to find the mean.  That ability, that excellence that is practical wisdom, that matters far more than any theoretical knowledge of ethics.  There's another corollary that Aristotle draws that I think is important.  And it reflects on the theme of the unity of virtues that we talked about in Socrates and in Plato.  Socrates thought that in the end, all of the virtues came down to the same thing.  They all really were a matter of knowing what to do and what not to do.  In Aristotle's terms, Socrates in effect said, look, every virtue is just practical wisdom.  In the end, courage is practical wisdom.  Generosity is practical wisdom.  being great-souled, magnanimous, that's a matter of practical wisdom, and so forth.  Aristotle says, well, that's not right, but he is right about one thing.  Actually, being virtuous, being generous, being great-souled, being courageous, all of those do require practical wisdom, because you have to know what to do in the appropriate circumstances.  So he says, in a sense Socrates was right, but in a sense he was wrong.  He was wrong to think that every virtue just is practical wisdom, knowing what to do and what not to do.  But he was right that every virtue does presuppose practical wisdom.  This is, you might say, a necessary condition for any virtue at all.  Because if you can't find the mean, then there's no way to attain whatever that virtue is.  You may want to be a courageous person, for example, but you don't know when it's appropriate.  to stand your ground and when you should really retreat.  You don't know when you should advance and when you should be cautious.  The same thing is true of generosity.  If you can't find the mean, well, you won't be able to tell when you're being stingy, when you're being overindulgent.  You won't be able to attain generosity.  So practical wisdom isn't what virtue is.  On the other hand, it is a necessary condition for the possession of any virtue at all.  What follows from this is, as Aristotle puts it, it isn't possible to be good in the strict sense without practical wisdom.  You've got to be able to find that mean.  And so excellence for a human being, being virtuous at all, even in any particular respect, let alone in general, requires practical wisdom.  You can't be a good person without being practically wise.  On the other hand, he says, you also can't be practically wise without moral virtue.  Now that's a more surprising claim.  It looks like there he's actually saying, well, maybe this is enough.  If you have practical wisdom, you have a generalized excellence that will enable you to know what to do to find that mean when it's an issue of courage or generosity or kindness or anything else.  And so there's a way of taking what he says there.  that makes it sound like he's siding with Socrates after all.  I don't think he is.  I think it relates to the point about the importance of habits.  That is to say, how do you attain practical wisdom?  We've said already, it's not a matter of theoretical study.  You don't read books about practical wisdom and become practically wise.  How do you do it?  You observe people who are leading good lives.  You observe people with practical wisdom.  And you try to develop the sensitivity that they have to see when is enough and when it's too much.  And so the idea is really this.  You have to actually gain practical wisdom in the context of developing various virtues.  You have to learn, when it comes to a question of courage, when to give in to your fear and say, yeah, that would just be crazy to do that, and when you should conquer your fear and do it anyway.  You have to learn when your action would actually involve going too far and become rash.  or foolish as opposed to courageous.  All of those things are involved in becoming courageous, and that's one dimension of practical wisdom.  Well, the same sort of thing is true of generosity, of all of the other virtues.  How is it that we actually attain practical wisdom?  We observe the practically wise, and we start developing those virtues in ourselves by imitating them, by developing the right kinds of habits in ourselves.  And so in the very process of developing practical wisdom, we are developing moral virtues.  And it's not because moral virtue just is the same as practical wisdom.  It's rather because we learn various ways, in various kinds of contexts, of finding that mean.  And so learning to become virtuous, in one respect or another respect, is actually developing some dimension of practical wisdom.  In the end, then, you can't have moral virtue without practical wisdom.  But you also can't become practically wise without developing moral virtues.  That's how you do it.  And how do you develop those virtues?  By developing the right habits in yourself.  How do you do that?  You observe.  You find role models to follow.  You say, I want to be like that.  That person's courageous.  That person is generous.  That person I admire for their sense of humor.  I admire that person for their sincerity.  And all of those things are dimensions that will eventually lead you to a generalized ability, an appreciation of the good, and an ability to find the mean and learn how to distinguish virtue from vice.
