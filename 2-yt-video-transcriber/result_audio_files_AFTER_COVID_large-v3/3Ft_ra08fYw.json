            "text": "Reading theory, it's the worst part about being a lefty.  You may think you have all this leftism thing figured out but within 5 minutes in any leftist discord chat you will hear about 2 new authors, 5 new philosophies and 3 new waifus.  Whereas on the right wing the theory boils down to us good, them bad, here on the left we have a more complicated relationship with our beliefs.  Usually it happens like this.  Some smart person has a nice new idea based on some other nice idea someone had which was probably at some point based in something Marx wrote at some point.  Then the smart person writes it down in a 300 page book with as many unnecessary smart sounding words as possible.  and even before you have even heard of that book 7 other leftists have already written 600 page essays on why they are wrong.  And that's the left summed up.  And this video is going to help you navigate this mountain of books.  Well not really, it will be a video on how to get through 300 pages of complicated words explaining boring economic principles.  Or at least it will outline what methods I use to get through those.  The first big rule is to stick to what interests you.  If you aren't interested in very thorough explanations of why capitalist production sucks.  you might not be that interested in reading Das Kapital.  Sure you could read it if you really want to but if you already know the labour theory of value or watched my 3 minute video on it then you like basically know everything there is to know anyways.  A good way to figure out what the book is about is to have a look at the store page or just read up on the author on Wikipedia.  For our example I will use Why Marx Was Right by Terry Eagleton just because I am already done with that one and I used all of the techniques I will suggest now in this one.  The main problem when actually reading a book is how dense they are.  There will usually be a page or two explaining a complicated concept or idea immediately followed by the next complicated concept or idea.  It's almost like watching one of my videos.  This means if you just read a few pages you will have already forgotten the concept described on the first page.  Maybe that's just a problem for me but I would assume that you are the same for this video.  So how to solve this?  Well, I get three different color pencils and a blue and a red pen as well as a piece of paper.  Then I begin to read the book and I will mark important stuff and take notes.  Now you may be opposed to drawing in a book in which case I must ask you to leave this video because there will be some graphic images of drawn in books in this video.  Personally I think I can do that because it's my book and you can't tell me what to do with my personal property mom.  Of course you can't just randomly mark anything.  I have made up a whole system.  Good quotes are marked in red ink.  Surprising things are marked green.  Blue is for critiques and red is for orientation.  I will elaborate on what that means now.  Let's say I am reading through a book.  Once I am done with a page I mark stuff that surprised me.  One random example I marked.  the special economic zones of Guangdong and Shanghai are shockingly close to the conditions of Manchester and Glasgow in the 1840s.  But then I had never heard about the horrible conditions of the special economic zones.  and by marking it as something new which I don't do that much it immediately stands out in my memory and after I closed the book I was curious and learned more about it which further solidified the new thing I learned.  The blue markings are easier.  it's just whenever you think that the author is wrong.  Eagleton goes on a big rant about how people who critique everything but refuse to critique those they align with politically in his book.  so I just don't do that.  One example of a critique is in chapter 2 where he explains why the USSR turned out bad.  He says that you would probably need a big centralist government to give everyone the stuff they need if they don't already have it, as an example he mentioned that you would somehow need to give the people clothing if they're peasants which makes it likely for a big state to form to manage this distribution.  He also explains that he doesn't think that future socialism would have that problem since in our modern capitalist society we already have a bunch of wealth.  My critique is with the way he put it.  The way he phrased it, or at least the way the translator phrased it.  when translating it into German, it sounded like he thinks that a central bureaucracy is the only way which isn't true.  You could have a market distribute the stuff or you could use people's councils for example.  But what exactly my criticism is?  isn't even that important?  because just me thinking no this is wrong makes me think more about the whole argument than the preceding paragraphs.  The red markings are the most important ones.  They're the ones that help you navigate the book.  if you ever want to find something in there again.  About once a page you should highlight a sentence or two which sums up what the page is about.  Here is an example.  At one point Eagleton argues against the idea that Marxists are just a bunch of people with nothing better to do.  He explains that if Marxism was really useless and not needed Marxists would be happy about that since they would have more free time and that they would finally lay down their banners and be happy.  So the fact that people are still Marxists signals that Marxism is not over and that those people do care about something.  And in that paragraph I would just take a good quote which would remind me of what this page is about, like if Marxism truly was over.  it would be the greatest joy to all Marxists.  Make sure not to highlight too much though.  And now if you want to find that paragraph about Marxists not having anything better to do you can just read the highlighted parts of all of the pages and quickly find what you were searching for.  And that could be the way you leave it be and if that works for you that's great but I personally need a little more.  That's when our piece of paper and our blue pen comes in.  For every page I read I write down one sentence summing up what it's about.  Just very basic summary in my own words.  And that's usually enough for me to remember all of the stuff in a book.  On top of that I don't read too much at once either.  I usually read for about an hour before taking a break.  And when reading every few pages I will deliberately stop and try to recall the basics of what those pages were about.  And if I remember it I keep on reading and if I don't I have a look at my piece of paper.  And that's pretty much it.  I've heard about study guides which ask you questions about the book.  They supposedly help you in a very similar way but I have not tried them so I couldn't tell you.  And that's about it.  Thanks for watching.  See you.  I would like to thank my patrons for motivating me to spend time making these videos, and especially thanks to Aaron J. Patton.  Thanks for watching.  See you in the next video. ",
