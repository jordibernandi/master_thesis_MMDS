            "text": "Last week, We talked about centrism under threat narrative and the discussion was basically about people who use sort of a middle ground fallacy as an attack on the legitimacy of the men's rights movement and of men's rights activism.  In particular, an attack on our criticism of feminism, where feminism has resulted in law and policy that limit or sort of trespass on men's human rights.  And so we did a discussion about the fallacies involved and the nature of the attack on the men's rights movement.  And we got a lot of butt hurt in the comments.  It was quite interesting.  I have several comments from one guy.  And then I also have a couple of other people who are responding as to what centrism isn't.  And several people are doing exactly what we described and then saying centrism isn't like that, while demonstrating that it is, in fact, exactly like that. ",

            "text": "Well, I'd hasten to add that during the show, we were very careful to say that not all centrists are like that.  We distinguished between those centrists who look at both sides or look at all of the sides or all of the prevailing evidence, come to their own conclusion, and those centrists who simply say that the correct conclusion is that both sides are wrong, they're right, and they don't even have to look at either side.  They may not even find a middle position.  They just decide on a position that both are wrong without having looked at the evidence or both are equivalent without having looked at the evidence.  And that was the kind of behavior that we were calling out.  And what I find very amusing, I'm just going to read one of these comments about that.  And again, we were very careful to distinguish between centrists who... actually do look at all of the evidence and come to their own conclusion.  And centrists, people who call themselves centrists, who don't actually do that, but instead sort of almost like they hand wave, having looked at both sides, as if almost like centrism is a magical incantation.  So I'll call myself a centrist, say both sides are wrong.  And I don't even have to look at the evidence.  I don't have to actually significantly consider what I'm seeing and whether or not these two sides are actually equivalent.  I just dismiss them both.  Yeah. ",

I asked this person in response to a previous comment for specific examples to back his case and he essentially called me, like twice, called me names for asking for evidence and for giving evidence as to why he is wrong.  So this is somebody that actually gets hostile if challenged on his centrist superiority. ",

            "text": "So from this whole exchange, something that occurred to me is that sometimes these people who call themselves centrists who aren't actually engaging in an activity that really is sensible or rational or logical, which is to look at both sides, come to your own conclusion, look at the evidence, come to your own conclusion, determine whether or not both sides are actually equivalent by looking at the evidence.  But instead, they call themselves a centrist because a centrist does that.  Instead of being a centrist who is a centrist because they engage in examining all the evidence and coming to their own conclusion, they call themselves a centrist.  Say that that's what centrists do, which is, you know, when your centrists who are rational do that, and then if you call them out for not having done that, they say, no, actually, this is what centrists do, and no matter what I'm actually doing, I'm actually doing this.  So it's like... a fireman who says, well, firemen fight fires.  Therefore, when I'm setting a fire, when I'm actually engaging in arson, because I'm a fireman, I'm actually fighting a fire.  It's like you take the label, you say the label does this, and then when everybody looks at your actions and says, no, you're not actually doing... You're actually setting fires.  You're not fighting fires.  You're not... reducing fire, you're not pouring water on it, you're not putting sand on it, you're not trying to smother the fire, you're actually creating a fire or encouraging it.  When people point that out, you say, well, firemen fight fires, therefore I'm fighting a fire.  And it's an interesting attitude.  It applies more than just centrists.  It also applies to feminists.  when they use equality.  Yeah, the feminists will say, we stand for equality, that's what we do.  And when you point out, well, you're not creating equality, they'll say, but feminists create equality, so no matter what I'm doing, because I'm a feminist, I'm creating equality.  So that was just, this is just like, wow, this is a moment of, I think we've hit on something, Hannah. ",

This is why I like to ask feminist questions, you know, and they say feminism is about equality and therefore you can't criticize feminism because you're criticizing, uh, you know, a pro equality movement and, and you must be opposing equality if you oppose feminism.  And I'll ask, you know, what part of, of spending a hundred years lobbying the government to, uh, restrict or limit fathers' custody rights is about equality.  Ask them something like that, or ask them about the feminist history of lobbying against the rights and recourse of male victims of female perpetrators of intimate partner and domestic violence.  And as soon as you start asking hard questions like that, then you point out, well, you know, the National Organization for Women, a feminist group, Like, the biggest feminist group in the United States is the National Organization for Women.  It's not like, you know, just some fringe thing.  It's actually the biggest set of card-carrying.  feminists are members of the National Organization for Women.  And that group has spent my entire life lobbying actively against fathers' rights.  and other feminists before them did the same thing.  They've literally fought tooth and nail.  They've scratched back against not just equally shared parenting, but before equally shared parenting, just the concept of shared parenting, before the concept of shared parenting, the concept of joint custody, and all of that has been feminist activity.  So what part of that is about equality?  And of course, they never are able to answer that, ever. ",

When you go out of your way to explain that centrism can be applied in a positive way to any situation, because the positive centrists, rational centrists, look at both sides, and say, well, the reality is, based on the evidence that I'm seeing, is maybe this side is correct, maybe that side is correct, maybe neither is correct, maybe they're both are correct and wrong.  Maybe there's a bridge between them.  And you say that's what rational centrists do, but then there are these irrational centrists who make these logical errors by equating two sides without really looking at either one.  and saying, well, because I am a centrist, I am automatically right because both sides are wrong.  That process.  And then you get somebody saying, well, that's not what centrists do.  But we're not saying that centrists do that.  We're not saying rational centrists do that.  We're saying irrational centrists do that.  And irrational people that call themselves centrists in the name of centrists. ",
