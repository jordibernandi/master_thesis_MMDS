The place next door, you know?  Wait, I thought you ordered all the restaurants to close.  Man, I don't know what to do.  Just say it wasn't you.  All right.  Voter payment and they call me red-handed eating at the place next door.  Were there a lot of people there?  Picture this.  It was not that vacant.  Like a hundred peeps or more.  How could I?  Don't forget that I had Bandolindo gatherings.  Just a prime example of a really big hypocrisy.  You don't understand, we're not like other creatures.  Rules do not apply to us, we are the leaders.  Voters can't be trusted to be Indoidas.  They are more contagious after all their mouth breathers.  Just tell them it's important to follow all the law.  How any violation might kill a grandma.  Why you do what you want, even pardon in-laws.  Mr.  Mayor, how would you prefer your foie gras?  I have a wedding. ",
