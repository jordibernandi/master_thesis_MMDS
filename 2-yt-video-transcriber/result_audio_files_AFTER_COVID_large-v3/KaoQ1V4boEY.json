So my question is, when we say that these arguments show that God is a personal being.  Yes.  What would be the response to somebody like a \u2013 just for example a Hindu or a theosophist who would say, oh, well, the absolute need not be a rational being.  It could just be some kind of life force that just naturally does this.  Yes. ",

            "text": "Actually, all three of the arguments that I gave tonight lead to a personal deity and are therefore incompatible with all forms of pantheism which think of the absolute in impersonal terms.  The first argument leads to a personal creator of the universe because it leads to a being which is spaceless, timeless, immaterial, and eternal.  And there are only two candidates that could be described in those terms, either an abstract object, like a number or else an unembodied mind or consciousness.  and here's the rub an abstract object doesn't stand in causal relations.  the number seven for example has no effect on anything.  so it follows that the cause of the universe is not just some impersonal first cause.  it is a person an unembodied mind who brought the universe into being.  The second argument from fine-tuning obviously leads to a personal creator because it leads to an intelligent designer.  And the third argument, the moral argument, leads to a personal being because human persons have intrinsic moral value, and this is grounded in God as a personal being, and he issues then moral commands to us, which requires personhood and volition.  So remarkably, all three of these arguments lead to a metaphysical ultimate which is personal. ",
