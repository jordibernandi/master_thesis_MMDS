            "text": "so i had plans to make another video and you know what.  sometimes you just gotta listen to your heart and your heart's like no just tell them this one fucking thing.  that's more important than the other bullshit you're planning.  so that's what i'm going to talk about today.  so here we go.  I was in Ecuador.  I was having a lot of beautiful experiences.  I was really doing my spiritual practices, you know, stretching and incense and prayer and all amazing things.  And I was really connected.  It was a beautiful time.  And I got up one day and other mystical things have been going on, but I was just feeling good, man.  And I just got up and into the other room and just looked in the mirror and I just looked and I was like, holy fuck, I really like you.  And I just stood there for a minute and it just kind of washed over me.  And I was like, fuck, I really like me a lot.  And it just fucking whacked like a boss hit me in the face.  I was like, I fucking really like being me.  Like, it's great.  This is fucking great.  I really like being this guy.  I'm having a fucking great time.  I love being me.  And also, the knowledge was there that not only do I really fucking like being myself... I get to be me forever.  And I'd had enough spiritual awakenings at that point to know like the body and the death.  There's no death.  So it was quite a moment where I was like, fuck, I love me and I get to fucking be me forever.  Here's the problem.  As I'm going down this path, and I'm feeling more love to people, I kind of miss being an asshole.  You know what I'm saying?  Because I used to feel really happy judging other people.  You know, looking at other people and being like, I'm better looking than you.  I'm funnier than you.  I'm more successful than you.  Yeah, it was great.  So that's one of the downfalls.  And they don't tell you that.  They don't tell you that.  Oh, you're going on a spiritual bed.  It's all roses.  You're going to miss being an asshole.  All the stuff I had been doing for like all these years, right, to heal and feel better, right, and just be happy.  All of that stuff, it was a lot of stuff, guys.  It was all worth it to get to that point.  Everything, doing the stand-up comedy, doing all the crazy courses, all the crazy plant medicines, running around talking to women for like, you know, 27 hours a day.  You know, like all of it to overcome my fears and find myself and heal myself.  It was all to get to that point to look in the mirror and just be like, fuck yeah, I love that guy.  I fucking love that motherfucker right there.  And I just get to be that guy.  That's the only goal.  To get to that place where you're just like, you know who you are and you love yourself.  Because you're stuck with you.  You're stuck with it.  Even if you only believe like, yeah, I just believe in the one life.  And you die and then it's all over.  Okay, great.  Well, that's still a long time.  Even the one life.  Never mind eternity.  Even the one life.  That's a while.  Okay?  The next 30, 40, 50, 60 years is a while.  So if you don't really like you, what the fuck are you doing here?  What could be more important than getting to know who you are, what you're about, and what you're fucking doing here?  To get to know you on the deepest level, to fall in love with yourself.  What's more important than that?  Nothing.  Nothing is more important than that, my friends.  Now I can hear your little voice going, Sasha, give me something practical I could use today to get to this place you're talking about.  All right.  I've said it before, but it's this.  Treat every single person you meet with the utmost love and kindness that you are capable of.  Everybody, if you're at a gas station and you're buying milk, be like, hey man, I don't know what they're paying you, but it's not enough.  You're doing a great job.  I love you.  Okay, everybody.  And the more you do that, the more you put out that vibration, miracles will start happening.  That love vibration is going to start coming back at you all the time.  Sometimes the very same day.  This will absolutely transform your reality.  Just practice it.  Practice it over and over and over.  Remember, everybody is just a reflection of you.  What you get out is what comes back.  It's universal law.  That's how it works.  I just want to say, if I can get to that place with all the fucked up trauma.  I had a psycho mom.  She beat the shit out of me.  She told me I was no good.  She'd throw fucking shoes at my head.  I ran away from home at 15.  I was homeless.  My stepfather fucking died.  And my mother committed suicide a month later when I was 18 years old.  And then people ripped me off and took advantage of me because I inherited shit tons of money.  And it was a fucking shit show.  The first 20 years of my life was a fucking shit show.  It was a war zone.  I had a lot of healing to do.  And if I could overcome all that fucking shit to get to that point in my late 30s, to be fair, it took a while.  Where I look in the mirror and just go, I fucking love you, dude.  Holy shit.  If I could get there, you could fucking get there.  And what I'm doing out here in the world, all the stuff I'm doing, all the videos and all the training, it's really just to help people get to that place.  And as I'm evolving, wow, it's just really beautiful.  And nothing makes me happier than to help people get to that place, man.  And I just want to say, you guys can fucking do it.  I know it.  And in your heart, you know you can do it too.  I love you guys.  I just love all you brothers and sisters out there who are doing the work.  I'm putting together a little online festival all about healing, self-love, and consciousness.  And it's going to be online because for now things are weird.  But if you want to know about that, I'll be letting people know in my Telegram group.  That's the only place I'm going to let people know about it.  So if you're not in that group, you're not going to know.  Oh yeah, I should say I'm starting to upload stuff on my personal channel.  It'll be unedited, longer rants about this kind of stuff. ",
