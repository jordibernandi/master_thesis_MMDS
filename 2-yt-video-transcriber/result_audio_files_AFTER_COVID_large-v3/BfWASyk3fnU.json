            "text": "Well, chances are.  I don't know you personally, but I think I know something about you.  I think you're really tired right now because it's exhausting to give a damn, isn't it?  To be a person of compassion in a time and a place when compassion is in such great demand.  To wake up every day and push back against predatory politicians and toxic systems and corrupt legislation and human rights atrocities and acts of treason and leadership failures and presidential tweet tantrums.  The volume and the relentlessness of the threats can wear you out.  Have you noticed?  And you're carrying around a lot right now.  You're carrying around the big picture political realities, the systemic injustices, and all the news events of the day, and those are heavy enough on their own, but you're carrying around even more.  You're carrying around the individual names and faces and lives and stories of people who you love and live alongside and see from a distance who you know are under more duress than ever right now.  And these big picture realities and these individual stories, well, they begin to accumulate in your system.  And they reside in the headache that never goes away.  And they reside in your clenched jaw.  They reside in your elevated heart rate.  They reside in the knot in the pit of your stomach that returns every morning when you check the news or look on social media or step out into your community or step out into your living room and you see how much compassion is required of you and how little you feel you have left.  And so it's in this time of relentless urgency and relational fracture and national upheaval that you step into the world and you try to make a difference, which is why you're so tired right now.  And I don't know why you're watching this video, but I think you're here because you're one of the damn givers.  Because you have a deep love for humanity and that love propels you into the trenches of other people's lives where you try to heal and give and care.  And that all causes you injury.  Whether you're an activist or a minister or a caregiver or a politician or a parent or just a responsible citizen of the planet who is moved by other people's suffering, you feel the heaviness of these days.  Speed and activity can mask it for a little while, but if you stay still long enough, the fatigue catches up to you.  I want you to let the fatigue catch up to you right now.  With so many demands on your attention, it can be really easy right now to be disheartened.  And I want to help you stay compassionate and not stop caring, but not to be overwhelmed by the things that you care about.  Here are a few simple practices that I think are helpful.  One, engage in withdrawals.  In the faith tradition that I grew up in of Christianity, there are all these great stories about Jesus where they can't find him.  They're like, Jesus, you have a 230 healing, where are you?  And the scriptures say that Jesus was in a solitary place praying.  And for me, the lesson was that Jesus retreats to this place of silence and solitude, and then he recalibrates his mind.  And so when he sees the crowd again, he has compassion for them.  So for you, engage and withdraw, that withdrawal can look like a lot of things.  It can look like prayer and silence and meditation and time in nature.  But I think what happens is we only engage in the world and we never withdraw.  We never get rest.  We never can get that moment to recenter and recalibrate.  So make sure you're doing that two-step dance of engaging and withdrawing.  I also want you to get on social media.  See, social media at its best can do some really good things.  One, it can help you find your tribe of affinity.  It can help you reach like-hearted people.  They don't have to be geographically near you, but you can locate people all over the world who care about the things that you care about, and that sense of community really helps.  Social media also can help you stay informed.  It can give you information, and that information can really aid you in the work that you're doing.  Social media also can give you a voice and help you perpetuate truth and goodness and all the things that matter to you.  So get on social media.  But if you want to stay in this work for the long haul and you want to stay a compassionate person, you have to get off social media.  Because for all the good things that social media does, at its worst, social media will artificially enlarge the bad news.  You'll wake up in the morning and you'll see some terrible story about something that's happening in the world and you'll share that piece of news because it's important to you and then people will like it and they'll retweet it and you'll see the notifications and you'll see the story again in your timeline and a few more people will share it and you'll see it again.  And what happens over time, those stories start to get multiplied and you can be so overwhelmed by how large everything feels that by 10 a.m.  you may not even want to step out of the house and you're already defeated.  So what you wanna do is get off social media for a while so that you can right-size the threats, right-size the bad news.  It doesn't mean they're gonna disappear.  It doesn't mean you're gonna deny that those things are there.  It just means you're not gonna let them cast a larger shadow than they deserve.  So get off social media.  And I want you to play.  Do something that intentionally lightens you, something that gives you joy, something that makes you laugh.  Humor is medicinal.  Humor unlocks something in us that tells us that as terrible and real and oppressive as things around us are, we can actually be stronger and bigger than those things when we laugh at them.  So please, play.  And if you want to be a compassionate person for the long haul, I want you to create, to use your mind and your hands, whether that creativity looks like writing a song or painting or cooking or gardening, but do something where you're following your muse because when you do that, you tap into your deeper humanity and you realize the gifts that you have to offer the world and those gifts can be healing for you too.  And friends, I want you to cultivate gratitude, to look around at the world and ask yourself, if nothing else changed, if everything remained exactly as it is, what is still worth celebrating and to take note of those things.  Now, if you're like me, you might be gratitude impaired because I don't do thankful very well.  It's not that I don't appreciate what I have.  It's not that I don't appreciate the world around me and how many blessings I have.  It's just that I get so consumed with fighting for the world that I think should be or could be that I don't really think about the world that is, the parts of it that are really, really pretty beautiful.  What gratitude does is it places us in the present, and that's a spot where we can do invaluable work.  Because in times when there is so much pain and there is so much that is wrong, the most difficult place to be can be the intersection of here and now.  And I want you to be there, so cultivate gratitude.  And damn giver, I want you to know who you aren't.  Yes, you are a once in history, never to be repeated creation with gifts and talents and abilities that no one on the planet has ever had or will have.  But you can't do it all.  You are not the answer to every problem.  You cannot be the savior to the world.  You can only do the small and close things that you can do.  So it's really important as you do this work to realize that you can take a break.  You don't hold the world up on your shoulders, so you can step away and you can let other people do the work that you'll do as soon as you return.  And I want you to share the load.  So many of us, we feel like we're doing this alone and often we are trying to do it alone, but you cannot make it by yourself in this work.  Community is the most medicinal thing that we have.  Other people coming alongside us and filling in the places where we're weak or helping us with our blind spots or just being a source of encouragement to stand with us in the grief and in the pain and in the anxiety.  So find your tribe, whether that is in person or virtually, and find people to share life with because you can't do this alone.  And then I want you to take a hope inventory.  I want you to look around at evidence of people doing something beautiful that is going to bear fruit over time.  See, gratitude helps us stay in the present and see what's beautiful in the here and now, but hope propels us forward.  It is aspirational.  It is a soon to be.  It is yet to come.  And so we look around for evidence of people doing something that is giving us a reason to hope.  And if you look hard enough, you'll be able to find it.  I had a guy come up to me at an event and he said, John, there are two news feeds in my life.  There is the one news feed that's the news and it's social media and it's all the big stories.  And if I just look at that news feed, that news feed is only gonna give me discord and bad news and fracture and I'm gonna be overwhelmed.  But there's a second news feed and it's lower.  It's on the ground in the community where I live and in the places I travel and in the people whose names and faces I know.  And he said, if I look for hope there, well, it's really easy to find.  So when you're doing all this work, you may have to build a better newsfeed to dwell on the things that are close, that you can see, that you can impact, where your circle of influence is, and where your presence is really powerful.  So hopefully some of these practices will be helpful and help you keep going, keep being a person of compassion, because the goal is not you expiring early and it's not you giving up.  The goal is to help you keep caring for humanity and not be overwhelmed by how much you care for humanity.  it is exhausting to give a damn and you do give a damn.  that's why you're so tired.  so rest up care for yourself be smart about how you do this work and then get ready to keep going because the world needs people like you.  blessed are the damn givers for they will right side the world.
