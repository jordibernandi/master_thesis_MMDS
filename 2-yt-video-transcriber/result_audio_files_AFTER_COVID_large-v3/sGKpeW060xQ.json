            "text": "Hey guys, welcome back.  I wanted to talk about probably the three most likely vice presidential picks that we could see Sanders and his team considering if he is able to go on and win the nomination, which is looking more and more like a possibility with what Sanders has been able to do claiming that frontrunner status over the past few weeks.  And we actually know from Bernie himself, he did an interview a while back.  things that he'd possibly consider when selecting vice president is somebody who's female, somebody who's a bit younger than him, also someone who is a progressive.  And I'd also like to hear your guys' own opinions on this down in the comments section on who you'll think he'll end up picking as a running mate.  So starting off here, a pretty straightforward one would appear to be Nina Turner.  She's one of the key members of the Sanders campaign.  She's done a lot of great work in expanding Bernie Sanders electorate among the African-American community.  Also, of course, Nina Turner, a lot of ties to Bernie.  She continued on leading Our Revolution, the group that Sanders was able to build up during his 2016 campaign.  And it could be a smart strategic idea for the Democratic ticket to have an African-American running as VP because You want to get enthusiasm from the African-American community, which is a key constituency to turn out if the Democrats are going to have success.  We saw this in 2008 and 2012 with Barack Obama at head of the ticket, where the Democrats had a ton of electoral success, winning by rather significant margins in the electoral college.  So the Democratic Party, they want to try to increase the enthusiasm among African-American voters, perhaps having Nina Turner as a vice presidential pick for Bernie Sanders would be able to do that.  And of course, she checks off all the boxes of being younger, female, as well as being very progressive and she's the only option on this list that I have here that diversifies the ticket representing a key voting minority block of the Democratic Party.  the next individual here is Elizabeth Warren.  now there's a lot of progressives and Bernie Sanders supporters who don't like some of the things she said throughout this process or how she's been running her campaign over the past handful of months and probably a key reason why we saw her take a step back in the polls really between the months of around November through the point where we're at now.  And it seems like her campaign is on life support after finishing third, fourth, in fourth place, respectively, in the first three contests.  But we did appear to see a bit of a shift for Warren in this past debate, where she went back more so in the progressive direction, saying that her and Bernie have a lot of agreement on policy and It almost felt like she might be positioning herself to kind of get back in the good graces of the progressive movement.  And you understand why she would consider doing that, because the person who's the frontrunner and has been winning this contest is the one who has been unapologetically progressive throughout this entire process.  That, of course, being Bernie Sanders.  So the political calculation that Warren and her team made over the past handful of months just has not worked out.  as she moderated a bit.  on some issues, wasn't quite as fiery in her commitment to progressive policy initiatives.  And she leaned a bit more into identity politics, which didn't pan out for her.  But she brings a lot of potential positives to a Sanders ticket.  She has extremely strong name recognition.  She is viewed very favorably among certain parts of the Democratic voter electorate that aren't necessarily super enthusiastic about Bernie Sanders.  You're more affluent, college educated, suburban white women type voters who could be more enthusiastic about going out and voting for Sanders at the top of the ticket if he does pick somebody like a Warren as his running mate.  and Warren's also done a phenomenal job of fundraising through grassroots donations.  really if it wasn't for Sanders being so historically strong in the instance of those small dollar donations Elizabeth Warren's done pretty well herself in that category and if you could push together the strength that we've seen from those types of fundraising efforts from both of these campaigns together I think it would be a formidable ticket in terms of getting that grassroots donations and enthusiasm behind a very progressive ticket.  Now, the last choice here is extremely strategic in nature, and that is the Wisconsin Senator Tammy Baldwin, who's actually one of the more progressive senators.  Now, the Democratic senators in particular lean a bit more conservative in general, but Baldwin is a bit more on the left side of all of the Democratic senators.  And This would be extremely strategic in the fact that if the Democrats do go on and win the state of Wisconsin, it would get them to a point where it would be phenomenally difficult for the Republicans to try and win the electoral college without picking up a state like Wisconsin, which they were able to flip by the slimmest of margins.  back in 2016.  And we saw Tammy Baldwin have an extremely strong reelection bid in 2018.  She had the incumbency advantage, but vastly outperforming, for instance, the governor's race where the Democrat had to go against incumbent Republicans.  So that was a bit more of a difficult race, but that was pretty much an even 50-50 split, whereas Baldwin was able to go on and win comfortably.  by double digits.  And Wisconsin is a state that's been trending more towards the Republican Party.  But I think it's because the Democrats don't necessarily pick the strongest candidates to run statewide in Wisconsin.  I think that their Democratic electorate leans a bit more progressive.  That's why Baldwin has extremely strong favorability ratings, one of the more favored senators from her home state.  And then also, I think just Bernie Sanders in general can have a lot of success in Wisconsin because we saw him do it back in 2016 in his primary against Hillary Clinton, where he won 71 out of the 72 counties across the state.  And if you have an individual like Sanders who has proven that he can have electoral success, at least in that 2016 primary, added on to the fact that you have a Wisconsin senator who's a bit more on the left side, and you pair that as a ticket, it would seem like the Republicans would have a phenomenally difficult time potentially going on in winning what is one of their key states to go on and pick up the presidency.  So again, a very strategic pick, but also somebody who's a bit younger than Sanders, a female, as well as a bit more progressive than what you generally see from Democrats in the United States Senate.  So I think those are probably the three odds-on favorite vice presidential picks that we could see from Bernie Sanders and his team, probably some of the names that they'll consider when making decisions that decision and it'll be very interesting to see what decision they actually end up making in this instance.  and again i'd love to hear you guys own opinions on this down in the comment section on who you think that sanders would end up selecting as that running mate.  so i appreciate you guys stopping by consider subscribing for more and i'll see you back here for future videos.
