And a lot of these parents are irritated that their kids are not at school.  And this woman gets so irritated that she goes in her car to go smoke some weed.  And she just goes off about this.  I'm going to show the video and check out this rant. ",

I don't know what the fuck going on, but whatever the fuck y'all put in this air, y'all need to motherfucking contain this shit.  Because these motherfuckers need to go back to school.  See, I ain't got enough money to be calling the motherfucking weed man.  And the dispensaries ain't giving no goddamn discounts for this shit.  So trunk, you need to contain this shit or tell the motherfuckers over there in China that they need to contain this shit because I ain't got enough motherfucking weed.  Now y'all can come and take me to jail all you motherfucking wanna because I got a motherfucking car.  And bitch, and the way my brain set up right now, y'all can motherfucking come get me because I, I, listen.  Let me explain something to y'all.  Y'all don't stop this till motherfuckers can't go to school.  Y'all don't put it to where these bitches can't go to the beach.  Y'all don't motherfucker put it to where these bitches can't go to the motherfucking trampoline place.  I'm trying to figure out what the fuck is it that y'all want us to do with these motherfucking kids.  That's what I'm trying to figure out.  What is it that you want me to do?  They ain't givin' me no money to go buy no activities.  Chalk, you need to tell the motherfuckin' weedmans that they need to give us some motherfuckin' discount.  You need to put the money in the weedman's pocket so we can stay straight.  So we can stay straight.  Because guess what?  I ain't got no more money.  I ain't shut up for this trunk. ",
