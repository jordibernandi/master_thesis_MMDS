But I was always trying to figure out what should I be doing?  What can I be doing, you know?  So to bring it back to, you know, the dating thing, too, because I don't want to deviate too much.  There's an interesting idea that a lot of people have talked about in that when all of these women, younger women, are surrounding themselves with weak men, nice guys, angry guys, men who are abiding by, like, say, what the American Psychological Association.  Did I get it right this time?  Yeah.  You have men who are following this feminist sort of doctrine of how you should behave.  You shouldn't be stoked.  You should let your emotions go.  and then they end up getting angry at, you know, the women for not behaving the way they expect them to behave, the women then say all men are bad, right?  Because they're surrounded by them.  So these feminist types are surrounded by these weak, ineffective, nice guys who make them angry and resentful.  And that's because it's the only men they see.  They then say, you know, all men are abusers, all men are this way, or most men tend to be.  So then when you see, like, It was something I saw on Twitter a while ago when I started looking at the meme that was reset the clock when male feminists turn out to be abusers.  It's like, well, no wonder feminists think all men are bad.  They've surrounded themselves by these feminist men who are bad.  So now that's their world.  It's what they experience. ",

You've invested so much into this that now that it's backfiring on you, you're furious, you're angry.  And so now these feminists are surrounded by these men who are seeing its backfire.  Yeah.

And people who are into kink and BDSM and I'm super libertarian like you do you.  You be happy.  But what I think \u2013 what I'm trying to get at is that there's at least a subset of men who are weak.  and resentful and angry because everything they've been taught to do didn't work.  And so then these other women are like, I'm going to go somewhere else and not give it to you.  So they get really angry.  It's actually interesting because I remember when I was really young, I remember experiencing something like this.

They're going to be like, whatever you want, bear, you eat them.  Actually, it reminds me of... What was it?  There's a movie coming out with, I think, Will Ferrell.  And it's like him and his wife are at a ski resort.  And they're doing a controlled avalanche.  So they have these pipes that blast out.  It fires like a backfire or whatever.  I don't know what you'd call it.  Which makes the snow go nuts.  So when the avalanche starts, he ditches his family and runs and hides.  And this causes a familial dispute where she was like, you ran and left us behind?  Yeah.  It's like she expected her husband to try and protect and save the family, but he dashed away.  So I guess I bring this up because it's like, now in a mainstream movie, the plot point is that men should be traditional, but that's toxic.  And the wife is actually mad.  So I guess, I don't know.  I think it's interesting that we have this sort of duality or maybe duality is not the right word, but paradox in mainstream pop culture where you have all of these things saying men should behave a certain way, but then you simultaneously have other movies screaming not to behave a certain way.  Right.  How can anyone figure out what they're supposed to do?  Yeah. ",

But one of the things that every young guy has to figure out is how is he going to put a dent in the universe, as one of my friends says.  How is he going to do something that he can look back on?
