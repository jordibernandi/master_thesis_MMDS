If we're hoping for a champion, if we're waiting for a hero, we will be waiting forever.  Because it's not a politician that you're looking for.  It's the people in this room.  It's you.  It's the person sitting next to you.  All of us have a responsibility.  We can't fix it by ourselves as individuals, but we don't need to.  What we have to do is make one change, a small change, a positive change.  that can be replicated, that can be shared.  We need to create our ideas.  We need to think about these problems.  We need to identify not that Trump is a bad person, but why he is so threatening.  And we need to start creating defenses for it.  Moreover, we need to realize that defense is not enough.  We need to create an offense for free and open society.  We need to recognize that one of the central problems right now is one of debate. ",

You start a hub and the progressive thinkers come to that hub and they just keep building.  And that's how social movements start.  That's how progressive movement starts.  And that's how we fight and end empire and end wars.  We have to challenge that propaganda.  We have to unmask the brutality of what's going on.
