And the stimulus bill that was intended to help with the hospitals that were being overrun with COVID patients created an incentive to record something as COVID that is difficult to say no to, especially if your hospital is going bankrupt for lack of other patients.  So the hospitals are in a bind right now.  There's a bunch of hospitals that are furloughing doctors, as you were mentioning.  If your hospital is half full, it's hard to make ends meet.  So now you've got like, if I just check this box, I get $8,000.  Put them on a ventilator for five minutes, I get $39,000.  Or I've got to fire some doctors.  So this is a tough moral quandary.  What are you going to do?  That's the situation we have. ",
