We have it totally under control.  It's one person coming in from China.  It's going to disappear one day.  It's like a miracle.  It will disappear.  Now the Democrats are politicizing, and this is their new hoax.  If you're healthy, you will probably go through a process and you'll be fine.  Be calm.  It's really working out.  A lot of good things are going to happen. ",

Trump's lawyers have now sent a cease and desist letter to television broadcast stations across the country to stop airing the ad created by Priorities USA, a Democratic super PAC.  They're claiming the hoax part is being taken out of context.  Ah, you know, Trump would maybe have a leg to stand on if he didn't run horrifically misleading ads all the time before this.  So the hypocrisy is really stunning and it's nice to see the Democrats kind of give him a taste of his own medicine in that regard.  So I'm happy to see that those ads are extraordinarily effective.  And when you have Gallup reporting that Trump's approval rating for his coronavirus response is around 60% and numerous polls showing that he has matched his top approval rating.  He's, you know, now above water, meaning more Americans in many polls approve of him than disapprove of his performance as president, which is mind-blowing.  But when you have that kind of shift because the country's in a crisis, you need ads like that to call him out.  And so I'm happy to see these ads and look, good job Biden team.  Perhaps you might want to put your candidate in one of these ads that are more effective because, uh, I don't know if you know this, but he'll have to face off against Trump on the debate stage.  And it won't be a team of digital strategists behind him when they're face to face one-on-one. ",
