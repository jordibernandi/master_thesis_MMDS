So if you have questions about ostriches or emus, be sure to put them in the comments and I will go back and address them.  So first we're going to look at their feathers.  So they're actually quite different.  So... So these are, oops, those are the emus.  And then here are the ostriches.  So emu feathers are very unique because actually two feathers grow from each shaft, which is very unusual for birds.  And you can see that they're not hooked together.  So they are not waterproof.  They give them a very shaggy appearance.  And again, two feathers grow from one single shaft.  And then the ostriches are similar in that they also are not hooked together.  So again, they're not waterproof and it gives them that shaggy appearance.  And you can just see how large they are.  Again, big birds, big feathers.  And then we have some other fun things to show you guys.  We actually have ostrich and emu eggs.  So we do have two lady ostriches here.  They do lay eggs periodically.  They're not fertilized because we do not have a male.  So this is an ostrich egg.  So you can see how huge that is.  This is the largest bird egg in the world.  It's equivalent to 24 chicken eggs, and it weighs about three pounds.  It's about 5 inches in diameter, so you can see the size of that. ",

And everyone's wearing 24 hats.  yes and so anyway.  so Leanne and Carina thank you so much yep and we'll do these at 3 p.m every day while the ark and the creation museum are closed to the public.  so we've got lots of animals we can uh yes we can talk about and we've been looking at other things that we can do and animal programs and so join us for the others as we move forward.  actually I would hope that we didn't have to do any more, that the Arkham Creation Museum were open.
