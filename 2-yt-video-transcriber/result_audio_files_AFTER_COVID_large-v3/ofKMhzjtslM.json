Because I'm going to take y'all on a hell of a... Yeah, you're going to have to go to Twitter and all that shit.  Yeah.  Because I'm about to drag Candace.  Let me take a swig.  Candace, really.  I have to thank Lisa Cabrera again.  You know, we had one of them deep talks.  You know, I had missed a little something.  But, you know, I done got myself up to speed.  You know, I done did my thing on that anchor.  You got to get over there, my royal family.  After this, you know, you can go to community.  You can go to the top of the channel.  It'll be panty and all that.  Josie.  Oh, yeah.  True Royal did that.  Yeah, I did that.  So, Candace, you ain't been taking care of the home front, little girl.  Where's your big girl panties?  Now, you done got yourself knocked up.  And I knew something was wrong.  And I go much deeper, my royal family, because I couldn't, you know, I had to go to anchor because I can't censor myself.  You know, true royal things just come out.  I speak.  So, while you trying to make America great again, you all kissing Trump's ass.  He's essentially fired.  You ain't taking care of home front.  You know?  And then your husband.  You know?  And you told it.  I felt something.  I heard some things.  But I wasn't sure.  But it came out of your mouth.  Oh yeah, Candace.  It came out of your mouth.  So, a lot of y'all know and some of y'all don't.  So, check this out.  This wasn't no jam joke.  I'll tell y'all straight up.  Now, Candace said at 1253 a.m.  Very crucial time.  Yes, my husband did cheat on me with my brother.  period yes he said no when i asked to join him.  i'm like what lisa was.  i was like wait a minute lisa wait a minute you know.  true we're all been you know dealing with some stuff but you know i'm fully awake today.  i might be a little bit on the late show but when i bring it i bring.  So your lazy ass.  brother is sleeping on your couch.  Because he can't pay nothing.  But he's going to have to pay some kind of way.  So your husband found a way.  But the thing that's fucking up my psyche, Candace, is your ass to join.  He said no.  So this ain't nothing new to you.  but you was pissed off and you put it on Twitter and then you took it down by some people, screenshot it so you can't get mad.  Then you fucks up because you feel some kind of way because you see, oops, we'll get to that in a minute.  You see homeboy in this, but you pregnant, you got shit going on in your crib, but you always worried about other people's shit and you don't.  Wow.  Now, are you going to be able to make America ready, Candace?  What are you going to do with this situation?  Because I'm dragging you on anchor.  And it's juicy.  But let's hear what folks got to say when you said what you said.  So, you know, let's hear what you got.  Oh, girl, you all messed up.  Let me take another drink.  Oh, that was good.  Excuse me.  Okay.  Candace, you really done messed up.  And you ain't taking care of the home front. ",

He says that clothes are meant to have fun with and experience with, and once you remove the male-female barriers to clothes, it opens up more arenas to play.  But one person who is not a fan of Harry's experimenting is author and commentator Candace Owens.  So she responded to Harry's Vogue article on Twitter saying, There is no society that can survive without strong men.  The East know this.  In the West, the steady feminization of our men at the same time that Marxism is being taught to our children is not a coincidence. ",

You know, you're supposed to be upholding family values.  But you catch your husband going up in your brother and you asked to join.  And you didn't seem surprised.  But then you want to talk about all this other stuff.  And you want to act like you on the moral high ground.  And that is why Esau is doing what they're doing to you.  They never did like you.

So it's like the idea... of like women like get back in the kitchen like candace owens.  is that like?  you should be speaking your mind?  and candace owens if you want men to go back to that stereotypical role then as a woman you should be in the kitchen making meals.  that's i think that that's where the mentality goes.  so i don't think that's the way to go.  russia and china are.  what was it?  they're trying to take down society.  she kind of lost me at one point because there's no russia and china's plan to put hairy styles in the gown because that will feminize men.  You lost me there.  Yeah, it's a bigger plan to take down the West.  Hollywood is destroying society.  It's all satanic. ",

            "text": "I know Candace Owens has Hollywood guests on her podcast and stuff like that.  Once you get into this stuff, once you start to apply reason and logic and just common sense to these arguments, they make no sense whatsoever.  I get the idea that You know, there's definitely people in Hollywood that want to challenge the norm.  And like I said on Friday, the quote I go back to every single time is RuPaul saying, we're all born naked, the rest is drag.  It's all material that we put on our body.  Even if you're not comfortable with hairstyles and wearing a dress, it's just material he's putting on his body.  And it's interesting to have that conversation of why are you uncomfortable with a man wearing material in that kind of form?  Yeah, but to make these jumps about Russia and China, let's see what people are saying here.  So... Jeff says, can someone bash Harry Styles when she says we need manly men?  Janice says, girl, bye.  We can have both.  Nelson says, plenty of ethnicities have men in dresses and skirts.  That's very true.  That was another point I was going to bring up.  Yeah, as she says, we all have too much time this year if this bothers her so much.  And let's be clear, Candace Owens makes money off this stuff, too.  Putting these kind of opinions out there, it's getting her attention.  She's trending this morning.  She responded to trending this morning.  So there is a point that she wants to get attention and go for it.  I just wish... All the arguments that she puts out into those, like, 20 seconds of talking, I just wish she had more justification behind it, because there's really a lot of things she throws out there that just don't make a lot of sense.  Mio says, toxic masculinity.  Nelson says, your manhood is not based on your clothes.  What a stupid person to say that.  Code says, he should be able to do whatever he wants without having his masculinity or testosterone levels being judged or questioned.  There's more than one type of man, and all types should be treated equally.  Yeah, so, Candace Owens, I really don't know.  What are you going for there other than getting some attention?  Let's see, any more?  Paul says, no, my man makes my meals.  Exactly, it's 2020.  These old stereotypical roles of gender are just gone.  So I don't know where Candace Owens is coming saying she wants manly men to come back.  Because yeah, if you want manly men to come back, what does that role become for women?  What role do you want to go back to as a woman, Candace?  I don't think Candace Owens would be willing to go back to that role that some men that want women. ",

In my opinion, in my realm, I am absolutely 1,000% right and superior.  Y'all all sound fucked up, all right?  Now, but they bashing each other and I'm bashing them.  So, Candace, did you, you know, check out Homeboy's resume?  You know, something ain't right on the home front, Candace.  You know?  So your man, no, your husband, with your family values, let me take this one down, with them family values, told you no.  You didn't check your resume, Candace.  Now you looking all crazy.  Yeah, you back to this, you know?  You back to this.  Because with your level of thinking and your arrogance and your, ooh wee, that's all I can say.  Wow, Candace, you really got yourself in a situation.  Like right back here, Candace Owens failed.  You didn't make America great again.  The very person... Um, oh yeah, you got yourself in that.  But let's get over here because I'm more interested in this.  That you married ain't upholding family values because in Trump's and them's rim and rural, you know, it's all about being barefoot and pregnant and staying in your place and all of that.  They don't, they don't support gay folks.  They just simply don't.  So where are you?  I mean, you, you, you, what are you on really?  And then you ask, could you join in?  And he tell you, no, where the hell you at?  Then you get up in this dude's business.  Cause he looked like a fool with a dress on.  And I mean, you you nobody can't talk about anybody but true royal because i'm running this shit.  yeah yeah i'm being a pompous ass purposely see people can't admit that son.  um so they just all.  oh wait mass confusion in america.  ain't that something my royal family?  But check this out, my royal family, because I'm trying to make this short and sweet.  You got to come to Anchor.  When I say juicy, True Royal make it juicy.  So go over there to Anchor.  Like I said, you can go to the community or you can do the, what you call that?  the top.  you had a link.  you just hit it and you can be right over there.  oh yeah I take joy in dragging Candace Owens.  I make it real juicy.  so my royal family oh yeah let me just go back here because you'll see this.  so my royal family render your voice with your beautiful divine words and it's always my royal family.  I thank you for your love and I thank you for your support.  And with that said, I'll show you. ",
