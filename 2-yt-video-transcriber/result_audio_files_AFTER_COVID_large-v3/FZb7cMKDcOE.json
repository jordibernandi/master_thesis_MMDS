We've been buying silver for a while because the gold-silver ratio has shown that silver is more undervalued.  So one of the questions we've gotten frequently from some customers is, hey, I own silver.  Do I really need to own gold?  So what do you think, Mike?  We own silver?  Oh, go ahead. ",

            "text": "I buy both.  And there's a couple of reasons.  My allocation, when the gold-silver ratio is over 80, I tend to buy only silver.  When the gold-silver ratio is between 80 and 50 or 55, I buy a mix where I take my cash.  The higher it is, the more of my cash I allocate to silver, usually about 70%.  And then 30% to gold.  But it all depends on where the gold-silver ratio is in there.  And then if it's below 50, I don't buy silver.  I buy only gold.  I've used the gold-silver ratio for my accumulation plan.  I haven't traded in or out of them.  It determines which one I'm going to be buying more of or less of or all of.  And I do think that, you know, part of my plan is to \u2013 accumulate silver at these very high gold-silver ratios, which means silver is incredibly undervalued compared to gold historically.  And gold is undervalued compared to currency, the currency supplies, the size of them, and most stuff.  And there are times when these things go overvalued.  Gold and silver are not yet in a bubble.  They will be someday.  As we approach that bubble, what happened back in the 70s is that the public, when gold got too expensive for the average guy, remember back in 1980 when gold peaked at 800, it's actually 873 on one of the exchanges, but most people say 850.  When gold peaked at those prices in 1980, the average income in the United States was under $10,000 a year.  It was 9,000 something.  And so a guy goes into the bank and gets some cash out of the bank.  And, you know, he doesn't have a lot of savings.  He doesn't have hundreds of thousands of dollars, most likely.  If this is a guy that came in late to the precious metals market, he goes in and he, say, in December of 79, just a month before it peaked at 850, it was still down in the 400s.  So he goes and gets $500 out of his account, rushes to a coin shop and says, I want to buy gold too.  And they plunk just one coin in his hand or one little one ounce bar.  And his reaction was, oh, is that all I can get?  How much is the silver?  Oh, well, you can get 40 of those for one of these or whatever the ratio was at the time.  And that's when the public shifted their preference from gold to silver was when gold was perceived to be too expensive.  Because remember, it had been $35 just eight and a half years before.  And now it's at $400.  So it seems really all their life it had been $35.  $400 seemed astronomical at the time.  And so they shifted their preference towards silver.  Now, a lot of people will say, oh, yeah, 1980, that's when the Hunt brothers tried to corner the market on the silver and drove the price up to $50.  It wasn't them.  That was the public, the guy going in with just getting the one ounce of gold saying, how much is the silver? ",

            "text": "Right.  Very good.  Some good history there, Mike.  Thank you.  I'll also point out that silver, as most investors know, gold and silver prices tend to rise together, but there are some exceptions.  And some of those exceptions are silver does not do well during recessionary periods, sometimes historically, and gold does.  Silver doesn't do as well during stock market crashes, and gold does tend to do well during those periods.  Central banks don't buy silver but they do buy gold.  so there are some differences and that's some of the reasons why we buy both gold and silver.  so look at the ratio.  as mike said is your accumulation strategy?  uh but we do both own.  uh both gold and silver.  so Yeah.

And, you know, Eric Sprott, many others believe that it's going to go back down to that 15 to one ratio.  And we're currently up.  Where are we today?  Jeff, roughly? ",

            "text": "Yeah.  And so there's tremendous room for this.  However, the original question was owning gold and owning silver.  And if I've got only silver, why do I need gold?  It could be that if you're trying to play the gold-silver, silver is extremely volatile.  It'll go up and then it's going to come down.  Gold is going to go up and it might pull back a little bit.  It'll keep most of its gains.  Silver is a lot less expensive to mine and super high prices will cause a whole lot more companies to go out there.  The companies that are mining are going to increase production.  The companies that are exploring are going to put all of their fines in.  They're going to develop all of these fines that they've had.  And so more silver will come to market eventually.  Also, silver is found with other industrial metals and primary metals.  And some of those mines have enough silver to where at certain prices they can just change this from, you know, same thing with gold.  They can change it from a zinc mine to a gold mine.  They can change this from a lead mine to a gold mine or a silver mine.  And so other mines that are base metal mines that have been shuttered possibly due to a bad world economy would be reopened soon.  and put into production simply because it's become economically feasible to extract it to go after the silver ounces that are done.  So I would expect that silver is going to have this super spike like it did back in the 80s, and then it'll do a pullback that's greater than gold's pullback.  And trying to nail the top is going to be a very, very difficult task.  So I have plans to measure all of this along with how gold's performance against the currency supplies, the Dow gold ratio, the gold real estate ratio, gold-silver ratio.  And at certain gold-silver ratios, I'm going to be changing my silver into gold.  But recently, our producer, Dan, brought up the fact that when they're unaffordium and unobtainium, even though we want to sell our silver for gold, are we going to be able to get the gold?  That will be the question.  And at a certain point, nobody's going to want to let go of it, no investors.  And there's also going to be great difficulty for dealers to find gold.  And so the only gold that may be available is like kilo bars or 100 ounce bars or maybe even only 400 ounce bars or none at all.  If all those, you know, you've talked recently about all of the investment funds coming into this sector.  And if all of them are trying to buy gold, they don't mind buying a 100-ounce bar.  That's okay with them.  That's what they want, actually, is kilos and 100-ounce bars.  And so even those may become very difficult to get.  So it doesn't matter how well your silver is done.  If you can't change it into gold, you're going to experience the leverage on the way up and the way down.  And so that's the reason I have some gold exposure.  And the mix in my portfolio right now is I have about one ounce of gold for every 500 ounces of silver that I have.  And so there you go. ",

So you have to be willing to handle that as we go through this process here.  You might have to be more nimble when the time comes to sell.  So, Mike, this has been great.  Great input.  Thank you very much.  And we will see you in the next video for Frequently Asked Questions. ",
