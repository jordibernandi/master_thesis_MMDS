            "text": "I walked in the door about 9 p.m.  and she's on a couch with a guy, Sam, I know from some charity work.  There's an empty bottle of wine.  I take my bag to the bedroom.  The bed is unmade.  We always make the bed every morning.  what's going on everybody?  hope everybody's feeling good.  hope everybody's doing well.  we are back with another story guys.  i will put the link to this in the description.  so uh let's go ahead and get into it so my wife may be cheating.  He starts off with, came home from a business trip early to find my wife entertaining an acquaintance.  She prepared a meal and wine.  Now is locked in the bedroom.  What?  Me, a 54-year-old man, and my wife, who's 55, had been married for 31 years.  We live on the West Coast.  20 years ago, my company moved our little family, along with my three kids, from the East Coast.  Over the years, I have taken no more responsibility and I am currently a VP of West Coast Operations.  I latched onto the coattails of a man who became my mentor.  When he was promoted to North American VP, I took his spot.  He is now retiring.  He has encouraged me to put my hat in the ring to replace him.  If I get the position, it would mean moving back to the East Coast where we grew up.  We are well established where we are.  We are involved in the community through the charitable works of my company's foundation and our own personal charities we work with.  Our kids are grown and now scattered across the country.  None live near us.  Our weekends are usually full of events or traveling to see the kids' families.  I discussed this with my wife.  She has some issues with me getting the position.  She is not sure she wants to uproot everything.  The move would take us back to near our extended families.  One of our kids would be about 200 miles away.  This probably will be my last advancement in the company because at my age and position, now there is nowhere else to go.  We have discussed this and came to the conclusion to do the interview as it won't hurt anything.  My boss friend is pushing for me to do it.  I know many of the board members as some come to the charity events we participate in.  I also know the upper management quite well because of the years I have been there.  I have to emphasize here again, my wife is having a hard time with this.  I understand completely how she feels.  So I went to the interviews this week, flew back east to HQ.  interviews went well.  three other internal candidates and they are looking outside the company also i had to sell myself to them.  they did not try to sell the position to me so i know that i am not a sure thing here.  talked to the wife each night.  she started crying that she did not want to keep me from this promotion.  we would talk when i got back.  i know she was emotional because of the move but this was out of the norm for her.  the last interview was thursday.  I was staying and flying back on Friday.  I caught a flight back on Thursday to see what was up.  I walked in the door about 9pm.  She is on a couch with a guy, Sam, I know from some charity work.  There is an empty bottle of wine.  I ask, what was going on?  She said Sam stopped over to talk about an upcoming event.  Having a drink with a guest is not unusual when I am there.  I take my bag to the bedroom.  The bed is unmade.  We always make the bed every morning.  It's a habit of accomplishing something every day.  I walk back out and Sam is leaving.  We say goodbye.  Then wife kisses me and was asking me, why am I home a day early?  I walk past her in the kitchen, dishes on the table, pots on the stove.  She made dinner.  I was asking, what is going on here?  Oh, I was cooking.  So I was asking Sam to stay for dinner.  My wife will seldom ever cook a full meal when I'm gone.  She starts asking me again, why are you home so early?  She is really nervous and visibly shaking.  I told her I knew she was upset with a potential move and wanted to talk with her.  I then told her I think you need to tell me what the heck is going on.  She starts crying hysterically and blubbering something I could not understand.  Now she is a bit tipsy from the wine, but I can see she is sobering up quick.  She says, nothing is going on.  Why do you say that?  I'm usually pretty calm, but I lost it.  It looks like you're screwing Sam.  Do I have that right?  She said to stop yelling and went to the bedroom and locked the door.  So now it's Saturday.  She only came out to grab something to eat while I was on the phone and ran back into the room.  I was asking her to come out and talk.  I promised not to yell.  I know she is deflecting, trying to come up with a reasonable, explainable excuse.  I am praying there is a reasonable answer, but with her being locked up, I don't think so.  My boss called me and said another round of interviews next week.  I don't know whether to stay for the marriage or to continue the interviews.  I already bailed on dinner tonight since she won't answer me through the door.  I really have no one to bounce this off of.  My eldest son and I are best buds, but I can't take this to him.  Help me think straight.  Thanks, guys.  Wow.  Let me give my thoughts.  It seems very childish of her to lock herself in a room.  She's 55, right?  Let me see.  You're 54.  She's 55.  She's locking herself in the bedroom.  I mean, all the signs are there.  You pop up early.  She didn't tell you someone was coming to visit.  They're drinking wine.  Most of the wine is gone.  She's cooking dinner.  clearly something was wrong and you guys make the bed every morning.  every single morning that bed is made and you know it's.  it's undone.  all the signs are there so you're not crazy.  She's being childish.  She's running away because she doesn't want to face the music.  She knows she messed up.  She doesn't want to be honest and tell the truth.  It's very unfortunate and it's very childish.  But all the kids are grown.  If the career move is something you want, I would say go for it.  honestly like she's playing games being childish you want to be vp of uh at this company and you have the opportunity to do it.  i wouldn't let her hold me back.  if she wants to go be with sam let her go be with sam.  you know sam is her issue now.  eventually i think eventually she's going to come out and tell you.  but uh let's look at the comments on this one.  so let's check out the comments.  In the comments someone said, You came home a day early.  You noticed the bed was unmade which you state is very unusual.  You also noted that your wife cooked a meal, something she doesn't normally do when you are away, especially enough for two.  They were drinking wine.  Your wife kept asking, why are you home early?  not hey babe i'm glad you're back.  let's talk about the move.  the guy is in your household drinking wine alone without your knowledge.  i get that people can have friends over etc.  but this is different In the way it's described, you stated it's not unusual to entertain guests when you are present.  She won't talk to you.  Sorry, married couples just don't hide in the bedroom after a spouse is on a business trip.  People are creatures of habit.  The only time we break those habits is introducing something new that doesn't know the routine.  If she doesn't tell you the truth, you may never find out.  At this point, they both have had enough time to wipe their phones and collaborate a story that can seem plausible.  Good luck.  If nothing is going on, would she be locking herself in a bedroom, refusing to talk to her husband?  Sounds like she might be preparing to get her ish in order for a divorce, whether initiated by her or OP.  If she is stonewalling, there are one of two options.  She hopes OP forgets and eventually stops asking or she knows it's over and is just trying to determine what lie to sell him or how to get out of the divorce as soon as possible without having to admit to anything.  Someone else said, I only disagree with one point here.  If she doesn't tell the truth, he may never find out.  He already found out.  You know what happened.  I know what happened.  And OP damn sure knows what happened.  Her confession or other solid evidence may help in their inevitable divorce, but he does already know the truth of the situation.  And honestly, it would make a little difference to me if they had just effed or if they were about to.  Otherwise, spot on.  I agree.  Someone else said, if I was you, I'd hire a PI while you're away next week and start a divorce before the pay bump.  Yeah, he should hire a PI.  He should go to their next round of interviews and hire a PI.  But let's check out the update and see what he actually did.  all right update.  my wife may be cheating.  i just want to update what has transpired since the post yesterday.  shortly after i posted saturday i finally was able to get her to come out of the bedroom.  she had me assure her that i would not yell.  i said i just want to talk.  so i went over everything i saw The unmade bed, the dinner, the wine, Sam leaving right away.  She was asking what was wrong with any of it.  She did not make the bed that day.  She was trying out a new recipe, had wine with dinner, and finished it after.  Probably drank too much.  Sam is a long time bachelor.  His wife passed away seven years ago.  He stays busy with some of the charities we work with.  I just shook my head.  I know what I was seeing, but she has an explanation for everything.  I was asking why she would not open the door.  She started with she was afraid of me.  She knows that I have never laid a hand on anyone since the 8th grade though.  It's not me.  I would rather talk things out or separate until everyone cools down.  The other reason was she was not ready to tell me something else.  Uh oh.  We have known of the position opening since April.  He gave us the heads up and shortly after notifying the board.  The wife and I talked about it since then.  She has expressed that she did not want to start life over again.  She has a nice career.  Her company does not have a branch back east.  She would have to job hunt.  I told her she could just not work but feels that she would be unfulfilled.  She really thinks I will get the promotion because of my boss.  I told her over and over that it is not final until the board votes on a candidate.  So she has decided that she would rather divorce than move.  Wow.  She just wasn't ready for me to come home early.  She didn't know how to tell me.  She knew it would crush me.  We have a very solid marriage up to now.  We do not put on a show for others since we are in public so much.  Sex is still good, though has diminished in frequency as we have aged.  We both initiate.  We are very much each other's best friend.  She was right.  I am crushed.  I was asking what was her plan if I don't get the job.  Her answer was everything stays the same then.  I called my lawyer.  We are friends also.  Me calling on the weekend is not an infringement into his personal time.  After pleasantries, he listens to me until I mention potential divorce.  He stopped me there.  He said I cannot present you.  The wife has already hired him.  Whoa.  i was asking if he knew someone else.  he said he will send me a list of names from the other firms.  he told me he will not personally handle the divorce.  he will hand it over to another associate in the firm.  i still have an uneasy feeling on what i saw so i took a couple of commenters suggestions called sam.  i explained to him very calmly that that the wife and i talked.  now i want to hear from him.  he gave me the same story word for word like it was rehearsed.  then i got a hold of the wife's phone.  it was scrubbed clean only messages from saturday night and today.  i guess i am getting divorced anyways.  why should it matter?  but it does dang.  that's what she was doing in that room a few years ago.  i was off work for a couple months due to some medical issues.  I had the company install an office in my home.  I took one of the kids' old rooms and made a home office.  I had a couple of the IT guys come over and get me set up.  At the time, it was better than my office at work.  So I called one of the guys to ask if you can retrieve erased messages and call logs that were deleted from a Samsung S10.  He said that's easy.  Google it.  I was asking him if he could walk me through it.  So after a bit, we had most of the records restored.  I searched the phone and found lots of calls to one number.  I don't know who, a few months ago.  I found Sam's number in there.  A lot of calls, recently.  Checked the text messages.  Nothing overly sexual, but certainly not charity related.  Lots of meet up plans.  As I am finishing, the wife knocks on the door as I lock myself in.  She was asking if I seen her phone.  I opened the door and said, yeah, I have it.  I fixed it.  She was asking what I meant.  I told her that I saw her call logs and messages were deleted.  So I restored them.  Her mouth dropped open.  She stuttered.  You went through my phone?  She snatched the phone and stormed away.  I called after her.  We need to talk some more.  She went out the door and I have not seen or heard from her all day.  So Monday I need to call the lawyer.  I have already been through bank records.  No money has been moved around.  I printed balances as of today.  I now need to call my kids.  She is my life, my partner.  Now she would be gone.  I feel like when my parents died.  How can I go to such a position without her by my side?  edit through this all she is maintaining.  there is no cheating.  she keeps saying that it may look like it but she would never do that to me.  yeah right let's check out the comments on this one.  someone said so sorry to hear this.  it's troubling that she has already retained your friend in the divorce proceedings and it's something that you can raise with your new lawyer.  as to any potential conflict of interest she has had this set up from the start so that tells you where her mind is.  You were on your way out the door and Sam was making his way in.  Absolutely.  Anyway, I think your path is set and it looks like your marriage just died.  At least you'll know that moving forward, you'll be on the opposite side of the country so you won't have to have anything to do with her moving forward.  So, lawyer up.  Get as best a settlement as you can.  Go stir from your life and begin the process of moving on from your cheating life.  You deserve better after 30 plus years, but know that cheaters have no morals, just self-interest.  Good luck to you.  It's unethical for anyone in his firm to represent the wife if he has used that lawyer for personal work in the past.  Getting someone else at the firm doesn't erase the conflict.  That lawyer is not your friend.  Drop him completely and have your new lawyer tell him that the conflict isn't waived by you and you will loudly object in any proceedings and report him to the state disciplinary committee.  This is not a time to play nice.  Someone else said if she really wanted to be with you, she wouldn't consider divorce an option and she definitely wouldn't have consulted a divorce lawyer before you even got the job.  I'm sorry this happened to you with someone you thought you could trust.  At least you can move on still being relatively young.  So when I said if she's not effing Sam yet, I'm certain she is.  Even if the text logs don't show it, she will.  Like you said, she wanted an out.  She's using the job as an out.  She wanted to be with Sam.  She's planning her life without her husband.  She should.  He should do the same.  While in on that note, guys, let me know what you think about this in the comments.  I'll put the link to this in the description like usual.  wow i hope everything works out for this guy.  that's pretty pretty bad pretty bad.  uh let me know what you think about this in the comments and i'll catch you guys at the next one.
