            "text": "I think today might be a day that they start learning.  But here's the other thing.  I do love the statement that the company issued on behalf of the employee that was involved in this altercation.  And so this is really in the age of Twitter and Instagram statements, which really should be people being courageous and brave enough to do the things that they did, you know, when they were saying that they were about it, like do it up front.  In their statement, they said that, listen, the conduct of this person that was an employee is not to be condoned.  They weren't taking, well, the employee just responded.  They quickly said and got out in front of that statement to say that, listen, what they didn't do was right.  And so what we did was we terminated this employee and we don't tolerate that.  They considered their 124 year history ahead of kind of saying, well, We're going to investigate and we'll be able to make a decision later.  So kudos to this company for coming out in front of this statement and making a declaration that, you know, this man did what he needed to do to protect his family.  And anybody that agitates and works for us will be dismissed. ",

            "text": "All right, folks, back to my video in just one moment.  All right, so a lot of y'all always asking me about some of the pocket squares that I wear.  Now, I don't know.  Robert don't have one on.  Now, I don't particularly like the white pocket squares.  I don't like even the silk ones.  And so I was reading GQ magazine a number of years ago and I saw this guy who had this pocket square here and it looks like a flower.  This is called a shibori pocket square.  This is how the Japanese manipulate the fabric to create this sort of flower effect.  So I'm going to take it out and then place it in my hand so you see what it looks like.  And I said, man, this is pretty cool.  And so I tracked down, it took me a year to find a company that did it.  And so they make these about 47 different colors.  And so I love them because, again, as men, we don't have many accessories to wear.  So we don't have many options.  And so this is really a pretty cool pocket square.  And what I love about this here is you saw when it's in the pocket, you know, it gives you that flower effect like that.  But if I wanted to also, unlike other, because if I flip it, and turn it over, it actually gives me a different type of texture, and so therefore it gives me a different look.  So there you go.  So if you actually want to get one of these shibori pocket squares, we have them in 47 different colors, all you gotta do is go to rollinglessmartin.com forward slash pocket squares.
