            "text": "The Morgan Report with David Morgan.  David Morgan with you with the weekly perspective for the week ending 15 May 2020.  Well, there's an adage in the market, sell the 1st of May and come back after Labor Day.  And that adage actually works more often than not.  It applies to the general market and actually applies to the metals as well.  Most of the time.  I don't think it applies this year for the metals.  It may apply to the stock market.  So let me start off by saying I'm on the blog of Morgan Report.  So just go to the MorganReport.com.  Hit the blog and you will come to this page.  And what I wanted to point out right now is this latest article.  presentation i did for the money show.  it's available for free.  obviously all you have to do is click it.  you can listen to it.  it's an updated version of what if silver is treated like gold and there's some questions at the end.  so if you've already listened to that video you can or cannot take the time to do it again.  it's your choice.  but it is an updated fresh revised video if you've already seen it.  plus even if you watched it once it's pretty short it will reinforce what you've already learned and again took some time to edit it and make it a little stronger than in the past.  So you can go there, and if you do so, would you please pass it along to those that you care about that are interested in what's happening to the monetary system.  So let me start off the stock market like I usually do, and the stock indices are basically going in what I call a decision pattern, the channel formation there underneath the... 200 day moving average on the Dow, the S&P, and they are basically kissing and touching the 50 day moving average.  Moving sideways basis the Dow roughly between 23,000 and we'll call it 25,000.  And it needs to break out one way or the other.  I do think it's going to break to the downside.  But if you look at the S&P, it again is in a similar pattern, meaning it's sort of oscillating like a sine wave back and forth between roughly 3000 and we'll call it 2800.  I think you'll get one more test of the 50-day moving average, which is roughly 3,000, so bounce back up.  It will fail, having touched that the third time, come down and move down past the 2,700 level, which is the 50-day moving average, and continue down.  That's the way I see it right now.  Time will tell.  My point being that the primary shift has gone from the stocks in a bull market.  This is a bull market rally within I think an ongoing bear market trend.  that is a shift of trend for what it's been for years and years.  And of course the primary markets to the upside will be the precious metals.  Moving right into the screen here, this is from Reuters, obviously, equities edge higher bond rise on hopes of stimulus.  And this is Reuters again saying global equity benchmarks gained on Thursday, that was yesterday, with safe haven bonds also rising as investors shrugged off disappointing U.S.  jobs data and to comfort in the possibility of states reopening after lockdowns and food and economic recovery.  Well, let's pause there and think about that for a minute.  Everything I've said there is pretty much true.  but what we're not seeing is how many jobs are never coming back?  how many businesses are folded and will never come back?  how many people out of the what round numbers 30 million in the united states alone are going to go right back to work?  how many are going to go back to work at a lower rate of pay or maybe from a full-time job to a part-time job?  i mean the market is pricing in a perfect world where everything recovers to basically the state of affairs before the cv19 or situation.  i don't buy it i think as i just opened with my view on where the markets are going to go and it isn't going to be substantially higher from here.  time will tell.  so i really want to take the rest of this time to talk about the silver market.  I am on Kitco's site.  The market is still open.  There's an hour left as I'm doing this video, Friday afternoon, 1 o'clock Pacific time.  And you can see that silver is up almost 80 cents today.  You also notice that silver is up about 5% in one day.  Those that are paid members get obviously much more insight than the kind of work that I do for the general public, which I'm doing right now.  but as i've said for years and you've probably heard it in public lectures as well what i look for on a silver confirmation of the gold move is for silver to outperform gold on about a three to one basis which means if gold is up one percent on the day i like to see silver up three percent on a day and i like to see that occur again and again and again.  kind of a thing.  so as i've often said one day doesn't make a market.  But then again, a 5% move, which is well over 5% higher for one day versus gold.  The gold-silver ratio peaked about the 125 level.  I've seen some say 127.  I don't think the exact number is all that important.  But right now, we're back down to 105.  And this is with silver under 17.  Which means silver is outperforming gold from that historic peak.  And it wasn't a historic peak in a century.  It was a historic peak in all of recorded history.  The gold-silver ratio has never been above 100 ever before in 5,500 years of recorded history.  as I said during many videos and updates that I did at that time, not only was that noteworthy, but it foretold perhaps that we would be seeing the greatest unraveling of the global economic system on a physical basis than we've seen probably in all of history, which means it could be the greater depression.  Now, I'm not willing to sell that right now.  I think we have to remain vigilant and watch and wait and see how this recovery takes place.  But I am concerned about the physical economy.  I am concerned about the breakdown of the transportation industry, the foodstuffs in particular.  I think food is a big, big worry over the near term and the longer term.  Another few things I like to point out on commodities in general is when you get a big move up in any commodity and of course we're talking silver today and it trades up on the day and you see it come up and it trades at the high the rest of the day until the close, which as you just saw, we're an hour away from the close.  So I'm going to presume it's going to close on the high, which it looks like it will, but we'll see.  It's not there yet.  When it closes on a high, that's extremely bullish, which means there'll be momentum on the next open for it to continue higher.  Now, that doesn't necessarily mean that it will, but the bulls are winning.  There's no doubt.  And again, one day doesn't make a market, but it is a significant move.  And this is really at a level where most primary silver miners mine silver right at the 1650 level approximate round numbers.  They all vary.  It varies what mine, it varies how they do their accounting, it varies if they have lead or copper to credit against their silver cost, which is... accounted methodology but not really accurate as far with the real cost of silver out of the ground and putting the dore really costs.  but i'm not going to go down that rabbit hole right now.  i want to keep it pretty top level.  So those that are in doubt that silver will outperform gold, we've got a hint here that it will.  Certainly, I wouldn't consider us to be in a bull market until we're about $2 higher, $18.50 or so, basically the U.S.  dollar.  But it is nice to see silver coming out of the doldrums.  There'll be many people left in the dust.  Many people.  Silver can discourage the best of us.  I ought to know.  And that's why... I recommend really anyone that understands precious metals, the older they are, probably the better they should favor gold.  Gold is designed really to protect your wealth.  Silver can very much frustrate people.  yours truly included but nonetheless in a real bull market where i believe we are entering and if that entered and gold's leading.  the way you got to remember back at the beginning of this market gold started in 2000 or maybe 1999 at 252. silver didn't break the 555 wedge formation until september 2003 so gold led the way for the major move.  Silver peaked earlier than gold.  Silver peaked at the end of April, early May 2011, and gold didn't peak until September.  So silver sort of led, if you want to think of it in those terms, the peak, if you will, of the precious metals so far.  But we do have a third leg up.  I'm very convinced that we do.  And many analysts are predicting that gold will surpass its old nominal high of the 1950 level this year.  It does look like it's on track for that.  and uh silver we'll see.  i'm just going to remain conservative.  i'm looking for.  you know 18 20 i don't know.  silver knows more than i do as far as how much you can move.  but i just want to remind people as bad as it's been you can't have these 75 cent up days and this may just be the beginning.  and there have been some very uh knowledgeable people about the financial system that have spoken out for some time on the system at large and the fallacies that we're all taught to believe that are absolute inaccuracies as far as a real physical economy is dependent on a monetary system that has a basis in fact instead of fiction.  So we are there and that will continue.  Life is more important than just money.  And remember, a great big pile of gold isn't going to be the greatest thing to own if you can't buy food or if you can't buy meat or if you can't buy shelter or whatever.  And again, I don't want to paint a gloom picture, but I want you to think in a larger way than just financial markets or even honest money, which is, of course, basically my life's work.  do want you to think in a global way meaning what do you need to live?  what is a satisfying life?  learn to live on less learn to appreciate more because we're entering a new paradigm and that's really across the board.  i think it'll affect everybody including jeff bezos himself and that's how i see it.  i don't think i want to go much further.  I will be putting a couple of new studies for the paid membership behind the wall for memberships.  And some of them are available online for free.  I'll be putting up the World Silver Survey from the Silver Institute there.  So it's easy to grab.  But I think anyone can get that off the web.  Might be worth a read.  I'm going to read it again this weekend.  And I will be back with you next week.  Remember, there's nothing more powerful than the truth.  and it is in very very short supply.  the truth is actually silver has always been money from biblical times until basically it was demonetized by man in 1873 when we went to a gold-only standard and this whole idea that i've been doing recently on what if silver is treated like gold the power is in silver as money and people on silver the banks really don't.  so if you really want power or you really want high powered money you actually would be buying silver and you'd be telling everybody you care about to do the same thing.  and with the advent of the cryptocurrencies any silver based backed cryptocurrency that's the real deal in my opinion stands a very interesting position in this point in monetary history because you're combining a new methodology with the oldest form of money known to mankind.  And once that synergy takes place and people understand what that power really means and the people adopt it, we could have some interesting times ahead for the silver market.  So I'll leave it at that.  I'll be with you next week.  Keep your cards and letters coming.  I appreciate you all.  And I will be back. ",
