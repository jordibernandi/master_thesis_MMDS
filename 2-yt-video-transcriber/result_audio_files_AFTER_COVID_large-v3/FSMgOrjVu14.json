But when you lower your offer 2.2 trillion and you ask for direct payments to illegal immigrants and you ask for certain deportation forgivenesses in your offer, it's not a serious offer.  What we are talking about here is relief for the American people, for American citizens, not direct payments to illegal immigrants.  We raised our offer to $1.6 trillion.  Among that was $250 billion for state and local.  The $250 billion for state and local is the estimated loss because of COVID.  And also, there's $150 billion for schools, $50 billion above what Nancy Pelosi asked for.  It is a good proposal, but it's one that she is not interested in.  Yes. ",

You had 1,300 health experts literally sign a letter that said, we do not condemn these gatherings, speaking of the protests that we all saw play out, we do not condemn these gatherings as risky for COVID-19 transmission.  We support them as vital to the national public health.  So it's vital if you're protesting, but somehow political speech is no longer vital when it comes to a Trump supporter. ",

You are ignoring the problem here, which is last week, In Pennsylvania, you had ballots found in a ditch.  That is a fact.  In Wisconsin, seven military ballots, all marked for Trump, were found cast aside.  There are problems with mass mail-in voting.  I actually don't understand the lack of journalistic curiosity in reporting on this.  There used to be curiosity.  In fact, the Washington Post, before President Trump, highlighted the problems with mail-in voting.  They said the result was an unexpected stress test of mail balloting systems when this was tried, many of which were designed to handle only a small portion of the vote and are not ready to scale up in response to the pandemic.  So the media once said... Mail-in voting is not ready to scale up in the middle of a pandemic.  Now there's no journalistic curiosity when we're finding Trump ballots passed aside.  There's no journalistic curiosity when 100,000 ballots were sent out in conflict, they were inaccurate ballots, and then 100,000 more.  Shameful filibustering and lack of journalistic curiosity. ",
