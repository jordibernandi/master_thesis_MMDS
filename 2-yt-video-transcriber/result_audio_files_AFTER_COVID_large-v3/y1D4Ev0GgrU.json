            "text": "Hey guys welcome on in for today's video where I want to show you that a candidate can be around 30% or actually even less than that of support and still end up getting the majority of pledge delegates from a statewide race.  Now you might be thinking to yourself you need to get one above the 50 percentage point number to win on the first ballot at the convention and that number of pledge delegates equates to 1,991.  You might be thinking that you need to get at least 50% of the vote across all these races to reach that but that's actually not the case.  And I'm going to walk you through three different examples to show you how different things can be and who gets how many pledged delegates.  For this example, I'm going to use California, which is a great example because they have the most pledged delegates up for grabs at 415.  So we're going to use the most recent poll that came out of the state of California from Capital Weekly that had Bernie Sanders at 29%, Elizabeth Warren at 16%, Buttigieg at 14%, Bloomberg at 13%.  Biden at 11, Klobuchar at 5.  And then the two examples.  following that, I'm going to shift these numbers around just one or two percentage points one way or the other to show you how different things can be and how many pledged delegates the candidates end up getting.  So in the first example with what the poll is telling us, only two candidates were able to get past the 15 percentage point threshold to divvy up those pledged delegates.  Now, for brevity and simplicity's sake, I'm only going to be divvying up these pledged delegates at the statewide level, obviously on the actual day of the election.  It's going to be much more complicated than that where you have to go district by district.  And then also there's a little bit of math at the statewide level on top of that.  But again, we don't want to be here all day going through every single district in this hypothetical.  We're just going to be doing it on that statewide level.  So in this instance, only two of the candidates reached that 15 percentage point threshold.  So they're the only ones that would get the pledge delegates in this instance.  So what you would do is take 29 plus 16, which is 45, and then take your number and divide it By that 45.  So in Sanders instance, that would be 29 divided by 45.  And then you would times that by 415 pledge delegates.  So that gets you how many pledge delegates that you would end up receiving.  So 29 divided by 45 times 415.  And that gets you to about 267, which is considerably more than what half of 415 would be, which in my head that would come out to about 207 or 208.  So again, he didn't get over 50% of the vote in the state, but based on who was able to reach that threshold, Sanders was still able to get quite a few more pledged delegates.  And that's going to be very important for him to do throughout this process.  If he's going to reach that 1,991 to win on the first ballot at the convention.  So in, Warren's case, you would do 16 divided by 45 times 415.  And that would equal 148.  And then all the other candidates would get zero in this instance.  Now, again, in reality, if you're getting 14 or 13% on the statewide level, there's probably going to be congressional districts here and there where you're getting above the 15 percentage point threshold, which in that instance, you would be getting something in the way of pledged delegates.  But again, for simplicity sake, we're just going to be giving them out at the statewide level.  So that's the first example.  Now I want to go through a couple of more extreme examples.  So let's start here by having Warren just received a couple of percentage points to 14.  So then that means no candidate was able to reach the threshold other than Bernie Sanders, which would mean that among those that would divvy up, it would just be Sanders.  So that would be 29 divided by 29. which would be one, of course, times 415 would equal 415 pledged delegates.  And then all the other candidates in this instance would be at zero.  So it just goes to show you how little things can change and the difference in the number of pledged delegates that would end up being divvied among these candidates.  But then to go the other direction, let's say that Buttigieg did a little bit better and was able to grab 15%.  And then also Bloomberg just a little bit better than where he was at in the polls, grabbing 15%.  So now you have four candidates that are divvying up these pledged delegates.  So then you would have to take 29 plus 16 plus 15 plus 15, which would get you 75 in total.  So in that case, it would be 29 divided by 75 times 415.  And that's about 160 pledged delegates.  So it just goes to show you what a difference it can be based on how many candidates are reaching that 15 percentage point threshold.  If it's only one, you get 100% of it.  If it's only two and you have the most, then you're going to get above that 50% of the pledged delegates, which is a really key thing to do across all these states if you're going to reach that 1,991 by the time we reach the convention.  And then in another example, if you're splitting it up four ways, then you're only down to 160 pledged delegates in this instance where The rest of the candidates will split them up fairly evenly among the 16, 15 and 15 individuals.  So I'll go through and do that math real quickly.  So for Warren, it would be about 89.  And for Buttigieg and Bloomberg, it would be around 83 in this instance.  And then Biden would still be at zero along with Klobuchar not reaching that 15 percentage point threshold.  So essentially, if you want your candidate to get as many pledged delegates from the state races as possible, you want as few candidates giving getting above that 15 percentage point threshold.  You can see in the example where there's two above the 15 percent threshold.  Then again, whoever was ahead in that instance would get the majority of pledged delegates.  If only one candidate is getting above the threshold, they would get 100 percent of the pledged delegates.  But then if you have four candidates, for instance, it actually ends up getting split a number of different ways.  And whoever ended up getting the most support gets quite a bit less than 50% of the pledged delegates.  So on election night, when you're hoping that your candidate is doing well, you don't want to just look at candidates.  if they're getting first place, you also want to take a look at their competitors and seeing if they're just above or below the threshold needed to be among the individuals that split up these pledge delegates.  And the less that are able to reach that threshold across all of these congressional districts, then the higher likelihood of being that you're going to get a higher number of pledge delegates, which will help in the efforts to try to win on the first ballot at the convention.  So I hope this video was interesting and illuminating in terms of how many candidates are in this race right now and the dynamics of the race that are at play here and what you should be looking for on election day if you want your candidate to get as many of those important pledge delegates as possible.
