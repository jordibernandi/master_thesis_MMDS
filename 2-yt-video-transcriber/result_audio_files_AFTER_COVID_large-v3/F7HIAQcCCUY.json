I really think that it should make somebody question whether the Christian God exists.  If this God is really omnibenevolent, then why would he allow more than 180,000 people in the United States alone die from this disease?  And this is not the first time a major pandemic has hit the human race.  This good god also let it happen back in 1917 and 1918.  This omnibenevolent god also let it happen back in 1917 and 1918 with the Spanish flu.  If this god does exist, then he is either sitting back and watching it happen while doing nothing, or he is the one that is actively causing it.  Either way, he's not omnibenevolent by any reasonable standard.  But if that God doesn't live up to the claims of the Bible, then does he even exist?  These are reasonable questions to be asking in any situation, not just a global pandemic. ",
