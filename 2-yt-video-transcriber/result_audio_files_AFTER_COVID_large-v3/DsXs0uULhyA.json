That's Kyle, my engineer over here, killing.  Good job.  How y'all doing?  That's where we're trying to get some magic together.  We're doing the new Mink Slide EP.  So that's going to be coming pretty soon.  What's a lot of y'all in here?  What's up on Chantel?  God damn.  This is Lee Tyson, man.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, man.  RIP to our sister, Cicely Tyson, man.  You know, it felt like she was gonna live forever.  You know, she was 96 years old.  You know, so, you know, 2021 is a motherfucker already.  Yeah, that's our legend, man.  That is our legend.  Yeah, I'm gonna talk about that on my show tonight.  I'm gonna talk about a girl who got beat up by Zaddy.  I'm going to discuss that when I'm going home in a minute.  I'm going to do my broadcast.  I got to go out of town tomorrow, so I've been very busy.  That's why I haven't done my podcast this week, but I'm going to do it tonight when I get to the crib.  Yeah, we're in here heavy.  It's 800 people in here, man.  What's up, Pretty Candles?

The bug breaking movie is coming out.  Um, yeah, I haven't been on here in a minute.  It's been a minute.  Where are my Atlanta people?  Man, I got a bone to pick with y'all niggas in Atlanta.  Where are my Atlanta people?  Speaking of Cicely Tyson, because I'm thinking about she works a lot with Tyler Perry, and they do a lot of stuff in Atlanta.  What's up, Red Man?  But where's all my Atlanta people?  Atlanta people, y'all voted in that Fonny Willis chick as the DA down there, the district attorney out there in Atlanta.  Y'all asses voted in Fonny Willis.  And I told y'all, because she was going against Paul.  And I told people that Fonny Willis chick, man, is bad news.  She's going to... The case where the brother got killed in Wendy's, where he was sleeping in the car and the race soldier ran up on him and killed him and all that old stuff.  And they had all the protests down there.  I said, look, that Fonny Willis chick... She's going to throw the case, and she's working on throwing the case right now.  She's pawned the case off to another district attorney or something like that, and they're about to dump that case, which I knew they were going to do because that chick has clicked in with those police unions down there.  My Atlanta folks.  Atlanta, come on.  Atlanta.  Atlanta.  And not just Atlanta.  I'm not just going to beat up on Atlanta, but just black folks.  Listen, Rayshard Brooks.  Yeah, man.  Everybody's doing all that marching and singing and twerking.  But when it's time to punish these folks, niggas start dropping the ball, man.  All people had to do was stay on code.  Brother Paul was about to prosecute.  He did prosecute.  He put those charges on that Ray soldier and people were pissed off down there.  Niggas got scared.  Y'all niggas get scared whenever these race soldiers are about to get punished for real, for real.  Y'all niggas get scared.  Y'all like to go down there and twerk and pop bussy and all that old stuff.  Y'all get scared when it's time to flex power on these folks.  Yeah, I want y'all to stop being afraid to flex your power.  Afraid to flex your power.  Niggas get real scared, just like with Biden.  Y'all niggas sat up here and voted Biden in, and Biden has done nothing but talk crazy to black folks, dude.  Niggas, y'all like marching.  A lot of y'all niggas love marching, so niggas love attention.  Y'all like these marches because white folks come out there and then y'all can show them your damn dance moves.  Y'all can go out there and twerk and sing and do poems.  And that girl who's doing poems, they got her on every damn thing.  That chick who did poems at the inauguration, they're clearly setting her up to run for office.  They're giving her grassroots credentials.  They're promoting that chick all over the place.
