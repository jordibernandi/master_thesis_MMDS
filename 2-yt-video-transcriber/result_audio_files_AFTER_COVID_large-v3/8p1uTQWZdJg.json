It's very valuable for them to be able to talk and to have somebody who is empathic and non-judgmental.  To listen in a confidential way can be extraordinarily beneficial to people. ",

For me that is within hospital where people are specifically challenged with topics around life and death but also about illnesses, about making sense about relationships that they might have while being in hospital and away from family that might be further out.  So it's about actually providing that listening ear, that empathy and that care to somebody in those times of need. ",

There are some people who don't get many visitors, feel very isolated, and there are things going on in their heads that they want to articulate.  Some people may be having an operation the next day or in a few days, which is life-threatening.  And that makes people think about what's important in their lives, what their values are, what their priorities are.  Some people have conditions which have changed their lives.  They're not able to be active, they may lose their jobs, they may lose their homes.  And they need to explore what that means to them. ",

We can often think to ourselves and have that internal dialogue and conversation.  We think that we've already touched upon certain topics.  We know ourselves quite well, don't we?  At least that's what we think.  But by sharing it with somebody else, by vocalizing our thoughts and by projecting that outwards to another human being and sharing that, has a very significant power, has a specific expression to what you're thinking.  And it actually helps you to reflect more on what's going on internally by externally exploring that with another human being. ",
