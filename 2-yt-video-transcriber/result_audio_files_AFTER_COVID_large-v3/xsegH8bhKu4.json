            "text": "Well, I just saw the news before we came into this interview.  Massachusetts legislature has just passed an amendment in the budget bill that would allow abortions after 24 weeks.  eliminate parental consent, and remove the requirement for abortionists to attempt to preserve the life of a child that survives an abortion.  And when I've been talking with pastors, and this has been the shocking thing to me, I don't know if abortion has just become white noise to many in the body of Christ.  I've talked with pastors who said, well, you know, that's their choice.  There are other issues that we're facing, whether it be race or whether it be the economy or immigration that are far more important than that.  What do you say to ministers who have kind of put abortion on the back burner as far as issues are concerned? ",

The Bible says that God hates the shedding of innocent blood.  So let's stop right there.  Let me ask you a question, viewer.  Is killing a baby shedding innocent blood?  If it is, God hates it.  He hates it.  And you can't skirt around it.  And here's what a pastor did on the West Coast that you're mentioning.  He said, politics is a matter of multiple policies and factors.  And abortion is just one of them.  No, it's not.  It's the deal breaker.  It's where you part company with the world.  It's the unacceptable non-negotiable end of conversation.  There's not anything more to say.  If you condone, if you placate, abortion, you're no better than the Germans who thought that the smoke coming up from the concentration camps was a bakery.  It is absolutely essential that we have an abhorrent, inescapable, with extreme commitment against this bloodshed because it's bringing the curse on America. ",

The Biden administration would just further that if they were ever sworn into office.  How can we turn these restrictions around?  because they've turned the debate so that it really it's no longer about abortion.  It's about the first amendment because without it you can't argue against abortion.  We have now come to the place where we have to fight to defend the first amendment.  What can we do right now as Christians to make these restrictions the worst mistake these liberal politicians have ever made? ",

I'll make this real quick.  I woke up.  And the Lord led me to read the story of the leper that he healed in the book of Matthew chapter 8.  And this leper broke the law by falling at the feet of Christ.  This leper broke the law and Jesus, he asked, if you wanted to, you can make me whole.  And Jesus said, I want to.  And the Bible says he was full of leprosy and Christ extended his hand and laid his hand on the leper, breaking the Levitical law, and the man was healed.  And suddenly I heard the voice of people in Fresno, California, and the voice said, if you wanted to, you can come over here and help us.  A city overrun by homelessness, drug addiction, and gang violence, high murder rate, and every form of despair that the modern left is capable of doling out.  And the Lord said, take your tent.  We emptied our bank account, went down to Fresno, told them we were going to set up our tent, found a park with people with a conscience that said, we don't care what the city says.  We want you to do this tent crusade.  And so the 10th crusade was going to happen.  Tens of thousands of dollars went out.  We had no permit, heard nothing from the city.  We knew that Sacramento at any moment could send in the whatever's, the green meanies or whoever, and they would have shut us down.  But up until 30 hours before the day, we still didn't know if we had a permit.  The day arrived, we opened up, we got word from the city, hey, we're not gonna go with Sacramento, we're gonna let you open up.  we had wall-to-wall people set up 800 chairs 1200 people showed up within six days.  we had hundreds of healings and nearly a thousand people born again.  now we're doing it again in january the same opposition to the lockdown that you see.  that's why i'm wearing a living proof t-shirt because on january 11 12 and 13 this is the first real public announcement i've made.  in fact alan this is the first public announcement It is.  It's being broken right here.  Today it was decided.  Walked out of the staff meeting, the tents going up on the old Montgomery wards in the center of Bakersfield.  And we're going to win the addict, the gangster, and we're going to get the church to oppose the lockdown and stand in the name of Jesus.  Because it's that.  And folks, you have to understand, this is rogue government.  This is not constitutional government.  They have no authority to do this.  And if you obey them, you're acting like a battered wife.  You are not supposed to be under their thumb.  That is not American.  It is not constitutional.  I don't care what YouTube's algorithms say.  It's time for the church to come out of hiding and stand up in the name of Jesus. ",
