It gives me a chance to make this response video, and it also gives me a chance to educate Kent Hovind a little bit on why he is wrong about what he claims is the inaccuracy of radiometric dating techniques.  You see, Kent Hovind is a young Earth creationist, and he believes that the Earth can only be 6,000 years old, so therefore all radiometric dating techniques must be flawed.  Now before we go any further and see how Kent attempted to have me whacked, please check out the link in the description where I will be facing Kent Hovind tomorrow night in a second debate.  The link will take you to the live stream ready to start on a Marvel Girls channel.  Anyway, let's crack on.  How did he start?  And that genuinely is how the video started.  Even now, I've no idea what that was about, but I've linked it in the description so you can see I'm not lying to you.  Anyway, I think they finally figured out what the problem might be. ",

            "text": "Now, as it transpired, Kent Hovind never actually got around to whacking me on that video.  He spent about 10 minutes looking at random adverts and clips of my video with his own microphone turned off before abandoning the stream completely.  It really was the highlight of my week.  So please do follow the link in the description and check out what I mean.  Now, you may have guessed that this video is really going to be an advert for tomorrow's debate on a Marvel Girls channel, the rematch with Kent Hovind.  But before we have that rematch, I'm going to give Kent Hovind a little bit of a hand so he's not so totally unprepared this time.  We are going to be talking about isochron dating.  Now, Kent Hovind likes to claim that radiometric dating techniques don't work because samples can be contaminated and that affects the age that the rock will come back at.  I'm going to be bringing to him isochron dating and how isochron dating proves that contamination either has or hasn't taken place.  So Kent, listen hard.  I'm doing you a favour here.  Now let's imagine that this is the igneous rock that we're going to be dating using isochrone dating.  We can see inside this rock that we have rubidium 87 and strontium 86.  Now rubidium 87 is a radioactive isotope of rubidium that will decay into strontium 87.  Strontium 86 is perfectly stable and is not a product of rubidium decay.  So now we can see that the decay has started and we can see that that first rubidium-87 atom has decayed into an atom of strontium-87.  From here on in I'm going to be measuring two ratios.  I'm going to be measuring the ratio of the rubidium-87 to the strontium-86 and the strontium-87 to the strontium-86.  So in other words the ratio of the blue ones against the green ones and the ratio of the red ones against the green ones.  Now as we go through the decay what you should be seeing is that both of those ratios are going to be changing at the same rate.  It is the production of the strontium 87 from the rubidium 87 that is affecting both ratios at the same time at the same rate.  Now the example we're seeing here is what we refer to as a closed system.  In other words we don't see rubidium or strontium leaving the rock or entering the rock.  And because this is a closed system, the two ratios we've discussed must be changing at a rate that is proportional to each other.  That's just common sense and basic maths.  And the inevitability of that means that when we plot these two ratios on a graph, each of those circles representing different minerals inside the rock, we are going to have to get a straight line because it is a closed system.  So now let's examine what we would see if it was not a closed system.  And in this example, we're going to have strontium leaking into the rock to make the rock look younger.  So hopefully this shows pretty clearly now that as the strontium is leaking into the rock, contaminating that sample, those two ratios are no longer changing at the same rate.  They are no longer linked together because we now have another factor which is affecting one of those ratios and that is the influx of strontium from the outside.  In other words, this system is not closed, it is open.  And the result of that is that we will now no longer get this lovely straight graph.  This will now become an impossibility.  So isochron dating shows us exactly whether a rock has been a closed system or an open system.  So there we go.  I do hope that's helped prepare Kent Hovind a little bit more this time than he was last time.  And I hope to see you all on the debate tomorrow night on a Marvel Girls channel.  The link, again, is in the description.  But for now... ",
