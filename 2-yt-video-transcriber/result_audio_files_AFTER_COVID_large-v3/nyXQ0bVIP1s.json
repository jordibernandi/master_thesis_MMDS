            "text": "Hey there, Internet.  My name's Luxander.  This video is very difficult for me to record, and this is hard to talk about, so please, please be nice.  Welcome to my new place.  Hopefully the upstairs people are not terribly loud during my attempt to record this.  Okay, so you've seen the title of the video.  You know what the video is about.  I am a transgender person, transmasculine person, which means that I was assigned female at birth, and I do not plan on having top surgery.  For anyone who's unfamiliar with the subject matter at hand, top surgery is a really broad term.  for a number of different procedures that transgender people might get.  When this is used in refer- in reference to trans women or trans feminine people, it typically means breast augmentation, and for trans masculine people or trans men, this generally refers to chest masculinization or double mastectomy, all of these different sort of terms can be thrown around.  It can also sometimes refer to people who are having gender-affirming reductions and not fully going for a flat chest.  It varies, but broadly.  in this context, when I'm speaking about it in reference to my body, it would be a flattening because I don't really feel like there's a smaller size for me to aspire towards.  I have talked about top surgery and gender-affirming surgery in general on this channel before.  A long, long time ago, I made a video about all of my thoughts about top surgery and bottom surgery.  Frankly, I don't remember what I said in that video.  I haven't rewatched it in a while.  More recently I have a video that's I think called Can Your Chest Be Androgynous?  And I made this video because I'm, I'm in top surgery groups on Facebook and I was finding myself having some really interesting feelings about people who are having radical reductions with the object of getting to a chest that was similar size to mine.  Like that there are people for whom it would be gender affirming in the same transition direction as me with my chest size as their goal.  I had a bit of a realization at that time that my chest is such a size that I am capable of wearing push-up bras and having a feminine presentation, and I'm also capable of wearing a binder and certain cuts of clothing and end up with a very masculine presentation.  It was just sort of a process for me.  You can go watch that one if you want to.  I've had a lot of conflicting feelings about my chest over time because I experience a lot more social dysphoria than I do body dysphoria.  If I am alone, I don't typically have a lot of the sort of internal agony that some people have when they're experiencing like body dysphoria.  So now we are still semi quarantined.  I don't really go out super often, and especially earlier this year I was not going out very often at all if I could help it.  And I have to say that I have learned some things about myself in the course of quarantine.  If my gender is not up for question, I would not only not care about top surgery and not only not wear a binder, but I probably wouldn't even bother to wear a bra most of the time.  Like, I'm wearing a sports bra right now because it's comfortable for the sort of stuff that I'm doing around the house right now, settling in after the move basically.  It's been very interesting for me to really, really, really recognize that many of the times in the past when I have felt really intense dysphoria about my chest, it's because when other people perceive my chest, they automatically conceive me as female.  And I'm non-binary, but of the two binary options, being gendered as female is much more painful for me.  I think that many trans people have a sort of experience where they're much more hurt by being misgendered as their assigned gender than any other gender, basically.  What I have come to learn about myself during this quarantine is that I don't feel that my chest makes me inherently feminine or doesn't\u2014 obviously doesn't make me a woman.  I haven't felt like that.  Uh, ever maybe?  I'm capable of conceiving my body as a non-binary person's body, and I don't feel internal pressure to change my chest.  Like, bottom surgery, bottom dysphoria is, like, a totally different conversation that I'm not going to get into right now, but as far as my chest goes, genuinely, if people around me are not using my chest as part of their categorization of me as female, or if my gender is not up for question because I am not choosing to bind, then I wouldn't even bother to do it.  Like, binding is uncomfortable and it is hot because you're wearing an extra layer of clothing, like, there are a lot of things about binding that are physically unpleasant.  My ribs have started to feel hurt sometimes, and my spine hurts sometimes from binding, like, a lot, because when I am in public, it is the only way I can reliably not be constantly gendered as a woman, which is the ultimate thing I want to avoid.  So it's entirely possible that because of these external pressures, which will always exist for my entire life, it's possible that those pressures will end up becoming overwhelming compared to my neutral to positive feelings about my body.  Personally, privately, I have feelings about my chest.  Not only do I not hate it, I kind of like it, okay?  And that does not make me any less trans.  It doesn't make me any less transmasc.  I still want to inhabit a social role that is very non-binary, leaning on the masculine end of the spectrum.  I think that for myself, and maybe for some of you who are watching, It might be kind of an important, powerful thing to claim as something that I can have and not hate myself for.  Genuinely, I don't feel like anyone has to have surgery in order to validate their trans identity.  That's one of the crux problems I have with trans meds.  is that they tend to have this belief system like you must transition in every way that is currently accessible to you in in order for you to qualify as trans, and that is wildly contrary to my experience, and the very obvious lived experiences of other people which I can observe.  If it wasn't for the overwhelming social pressure, I probably wouldn't even spend as much of my time as I do thinking about top surgery and learning about different methods and pedicle sparing techniques and all of this stuff.  Pedicle sparing is when they don't snip the nipple stock so that you can retain, hopefully, your sensation.  Doesn't always work, but it is generally thought to be better than just having nipple grafts.  Anyway, and when I say social pressure, I'm not just talking about the social pressure of being misgendered by people.  I am also, like, the reason that I'm so nervous about making this video is because there are people within my own community, trans people, who I would, who I would always stand up for their right to do whatever they wanted, who, who I would always defend as far as their, their existence as trans people goes.  Like, there are people in this community who already think that I'm a transtrender for having a nonlinear experience with hormones, like going on and going off and going on, those people are much more of a threat to me, like, mentally.  The damage that is done by those people and their disapproval is in some ways worse than the damage of being constantly misgendered by by cishet society, you know what I mean?  Like, my goal on YouTube and with this channel and with a lot of my online presence has always been to try to make people feel like this is what it looks like to be trans and be content and happy with that, or this is one way that it can look is what I mean.  I want to empower people to be able to make whatever decisions they want.  I don't think it's right that we insist that you have to be like mortified about your chest if you are assigned female or you are not.  you're not trans enough to count as part of the community.  Like.  I think this is really damaging to people's mental health, and it stymies a lot of genuine conversations that we could be having.  I think I'm out here about to say, like, you do not have to have top surgery as a transmasculine person in order to be really trans.  That is a huge investment of money, you're putting your body through something traumatic, and if you feel pretty okay about your chest already, like, you could be inviting more problems.  I like my chest enough that it's possible that if I got top surgery later down the line that I would end up remorseful, at least in some ways.  It would make my life easier.  Like, undoubtedly, it would make my life easier.  That is a fact.  However, I don't think that I'm willing to go that far basically to make other people less shitty to me.  Like, I don't know how else to put this.  My comfort in my own body is more important to me than how other people perceive my body.  And I think that I think that a lot of binary trans people feel that exact same way about the fact that they are going to get surgery.  There are TERFs out there who will tell you that you've mutilated your chest, but that doesn't matter to you.  What matters to you is that you feel comfortable and whole in your body.  I, as a non-binary person, have very different feelings about my body than a binary trans man would, thinking of you, Calvin.  My transition as a non-binary person has been very non-binary.  It's been very non-linear.  I have been on hormones and then off hormones and now I am on hormones again.  I have done things to make my facial hair grow faster, I still consistently shave my legs, and I'm looking into other types of hair removal for the newly- the newly arrived ass hair.  I spend a lot of time thinking about bottom surgery and learning about what kind of surgical results are possible, and not to go into any kind of detail, but It is far more likely that I will at some point in my life have bottom surgery than it is that I will have top surgery, based on what I have learned about myself during this quarantine process.  Like, I don't feel dysphoric about my chest when no one is around.  It is almost entirely because of those pressures of wanting people to gender me in a way that is less harmful to me.  It is harmful to me to be gendered female.  It sucks to be gendered male.  But in some ways, that feels like the closest thing I will get to acceptance in broader society, which still doesn't really have room for non-binary identities, you know?  At the same time, in isolation, I am thinking about genitals a lot, okay?  And like even that isn't necessarily a dysphoria thing.  That's a whole conversation that we can have some other time.  I also want to be clear that my feelings are subject to change.  They always are, they always have been.  I have always given myself this allowance for knowing that maybe being on T is right for me right now, but it might not be later.  And when I was off T, I was like, this is right for me now, but I might go back on T later.  Depends on how I feel about my body and what I want from my life, basically.  So at this moment, I don't have any intention to get top surgery.  I don't need top surgery.  I don't want top surgery.  I am happy in my body as a nonbinary person.  I don't always necessarily feel like I am attractive, but I think a lot of people struggle with this, and it may or may not have anything directly to do with, like, being nonbinary.  I really hope that this doesn't result in even more trans people coming after me to tell me that I must not be real, that my experience must not be real.  Like, my social dysphoria is a very very real thing that sucks a whole lot.  My body dysphoria fluctuates and right now is pretty stabilized because, again, I'm transitioning in a non-binary fashion and I'm very okay with that.  What I do hope is that my willingness to be vulnerable about this will help someone out there feel like it is okay for them to be who they are.  You are trans.  If you know that, if you know that you're trans, you are trans, and you don't have to prove that shit to anybody.  You don't have to drop ten thousand fucking dollars on top surgery in order to be valid as a trans person.  Like seriously, it's expensive, it's difficult, You, and sometimes, like, if you're trying to navigate through insurance, it can be grueling, heartbreaking years of waiting for approval and jumping through hoops and trying to find a surgeon whose results you like and who is within the network of your insurance.  Like, it is incredibly difficult to go through this process, and I just want you all to know that you don't have to do that unless you want to, unless you need to.  It is up to you to decide what aspects of transition are right for you and which ones are not going to end up being fulfilling and making you happier.  The ultimate goal of transition is to get to a place where you are happier than you are when you started.  To be clear, I've also made videos about whether or not you need dysphoria.  video about whether or not you need dysphoria.  to be trans, the overwhelming medical consensus is that you don't, and when I say the objective of transition should be to make you happier, you don't have to hate your body either.  If you have a chest and you just kind of don't like it, or if you are like me and you have this intense social dysphoria and you recognize that it will objectively make your life easier, then there's no shame in getting top surgery.  Whatever you can do that will maximize the positive outcomes in your life is the correct thing for you to do.  And it's important to spend the time to think about it.  I'm definitely not going to advocate for anyone to jump to any conclusions because there have been times where I really, really, really wanted top surgery.  again, for primarily social dysphoria reasons, like, oh my god, all of these people will not stop fucking calling me a girl and I'm already on hormones, like, it feels like there's nothing else I can do except get top surgery.  I gave myself the allowance to have that feeling and to wait to see if that's really really really how I felt.  I don't necessarily advocate that you have to have that kind of level of restraint about getting hormones, but with something like top surgery, which would be very difficult to reverse, like you can, but part of what you're doing is removing this excess skin, so putting something back in there can be more difficult afterwards.  Like, surgery is definitely something that you need to think about and consider strongly before running into it, and you don't have to do it.  You will probably still not see my chest in videos.  Like, this is probably the shot angle I'm gonna end up sticking with in this environment.  I'm not sure this microphone is very in the way.  I'm not necessarily going to change anything about my presentation to then emphasize my chest.  And I still don't want to invite misgendering, so I'm still gonna do what I do, which is sometimes bind and sometimes wear a sports bra and, like, feel things out on a day-to-day basis.  My presentation in my videos is not going to change, but I'm going to allow myself to have a little bit of freedom from thinking about this all the time.  it is not incumbent on me to spend all of my time worrying about whether or not I want top surgery and trying to figure out which surgeons do I think would have the best results, which ones do I think have the best bedside manner, and who will listen to me and my needs and everything.  It's still an interest of mine that I want to know about because I like being able to educate people and point people to the correct resources if this is something that they want.  But it's not necessarily for me.  It's not something that I need, and that's 100% okay, as far as I'm concerned.  This was a tough one, and I feel like kind of a long one, so I'm gonna shut up now.
