The only strange thing is that they didn't want to take all the IDW episodes.  They've decided to say, no, no, we don't want those guys.  So I want to check it out.

So you can see why he would do it.  And why shouldn't he?  Why does he owe any of these other platforms any kind of obligation?  Especially if he's acting in line with his own conscience, which he clearly said.  He's been complaining recently about the oppressive nature of California and the fact that it's becoming less free and he is moving to Texas, as many of his friends are.  And I think that a part of this criticism is also of Silicon Valley, the way that the tech giants, the big tech giants, restrain content.  Well, he said here, It will remain free and it will be exactly the same show.  It's just a licensing deal, so Spotify won't have any creative control over the show.  They want me to continue doing it the way I'm doing it right now.  I'm excited to have the support of the largest audio platform in the world, and I hope to see you folks when we make the Switch.  Hmm.  That is interesting, because today was the day that the Switch was made, and it seems that a lot of episodes have been not moved across to Spotify, for reasons unknown.  now there's quite a long list and there's quite a variety of different people on here and a bunch of people i don't know about like i don't know who jason thibault is or brian redman pete johansson daryl wright brian whisker jan irvin joey diaz.

I think David Seaman is a conspiracy theorist as well.  So, okay.  But they've got Louis Theroux.  He's like a British documentary maker.  He's totally middle of the road.  He's just like the regular guy who goes and does the crazy things with the lunatics in whatever experience he's having.  But he's not some radical.

If someone wants to cancel Joe, they could go on YouTube and watch the episodes were excluded from Spotify and see the dirt they could pull.  It really is interesting, isn't it?  And the thing is, I don't think my podcast with him was particularly controversial.  You know, I don't think I said anything controversial on the podcast.

People are just not very happy.  but apparently someone who phoned them up said it can be due to permissions from rights holders that it may reappear in the right.  folks spotify will hear about this issue so nothing.  i mean it might be a licensing issue but we don't know.  and as far as i'm aware joe rogan hasn't made a comment on this himself as of yet.  he hasn't actually made a comment on this and i hope he does because i really do want to know what the answer is.
