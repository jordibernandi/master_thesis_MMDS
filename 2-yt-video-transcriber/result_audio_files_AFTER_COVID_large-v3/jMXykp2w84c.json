            "text": "You know, when I make this particular video right here, I am truly all within myself.  I always try to make sure that I'm fair and balanced because I realize that I have a listening audience, some that are converted and some that are not.  So I try to bring forth information fair and balanced when I'm on the public platform.  That doesn't mean I'm always successful because You know, people ultimately have their own different mindsets and it's hard and it's very, very, well, it's extremely difficult trying to communicate with people if you don't believe a certain way, all right?  Because, you know, just as well as I do, the majority of the people in this world today, actually value their opinion above facts.  They value their lifestyle above the word of God.  They believe that what they believe and what they think and what they have at, I'm gonna say something very keen here, accepted as truth is the truth and they expect everyone around them in their circle or sphere of influence, they expect everyone around them to actually believe like them think like them.  And when, you know, ultimately you don't, you know, that may be frustrating in some areas or some, but sooner or later that, that, that relationship is going to be terminated.  So I'm saying this and I'm going to kind of keep it tongue in cheek, but I'm going to be as brutally honest and truthful as possible.  Now, I realized that on the internet.  And by the way, good morning, good evening, good afternoon.  My brothers and sisters, wherever platform I decide to put this on, be it Patreon or YouTube.  But I realize that there are a lot of so-called quote-unquote dating coaches.  There are many different people who have adopted certain philosophies.  you know it's obvious that america is a feminist society.  the court system is all about.  it's not about equality it's not about justice it's not about balance it's not about truth it's not about honor.  um i've seen it i've seen it and experience it all the time but today's video i'm going to be speaking about the dangers of the reason why.  um a single man brother I say man, meaning that you're not regenerated, you're not conformed, or brother, meaning in the faith.  All right, so this is both ways because there are two contrasts.  Anytime a man that is single and you see a mother out there that has children, let me give you the worldly perspective first, then the spiritual perspective, okay?  chances are you may not wanna look at that relationship.  No matter how sweet, no matter how honest, no matter how kind, no matter how gentle, whatever the woman presents, because you will always be last in the pecking order and you will never come before her children, never.  You are there to provide.  You are there to protect.  You are there to make sure that they are cared for.  You can be the best stepfather or boyfriend or whatever the hell you want to call it in the world.  But ultimately, her children will always come before you.  And you need to realize that.  She's in a relationship with you because she needs protection.  And sometimes women out there, they don't need a man as far as financially, but they do need a man for stability in the home.  because the truth is, you know, I think in this world right here is that people really truly don't understand roles.  If I can just go ahead and just put it the way that it is without being common, I'm just gonna tell it like it is.  You know, a man is designed to be fruitful and to multiply, okay?  He puts his seed into a woman, he's done his job, all right?  The woman, and this is the two contrasts or the two different perspectives, once she receives the seed of a man, and I might say this, and I got so many thoughts going on in my head right now.  Once she receives the seed of a man and woman, that's why you have to be very selective and very careful.  of what man you allow to insert his seed inside of you.  Because ultimately a baby is gonna come from that.  And you've got to determine what type of baby that's gonna be.  you're out here just running around having free sex to have a good time and all this other stuff and and you know that this man is a man of low quality low value and low character don't sit up there and start griping and complaining and stuff.  um when you're when?  when you realize that you've got a piece of trash for a man that doesn't believe in responsibility because you yourself is a very low grade woman.  That's the reason why you just go out there and lay with everything because you yourself is low base and low grade.  And I'm not saying low grade because somebody is low on a financial totem pole.  There's a lot of people that's got a lot of money that's very low grade.  They don't really give a damn about anything.  So don't set up there and fault him when you laid down because of fun and foolishness and virality.  that you decide to have this seed right here because you see men and women got two different roles.  Once that baby starts growing inside of you, once it starts kicking around in that belly and stuff, it's more of a reality to you than it is to him.  It becomes a reality to him when he sees that baby come out of your tummy.  I mean, out of your, you know what?  So anyway, at that point, the man realized that he has duty and responsibility.  At least a real man does.  At that point, the mom is very protective, nurturing, and caring, like the mama bear syndrome.  What happens too many times more often than not, that if you are a third wheel in a relationship, meaning you're married to a woman and she has children, those children, and women are very bad about this, women are very bad about correcting bad behavior.  they will let their children get away with almost any damn thing.  And I'm not saying that they won't give some form of correction, but when it comes to correcting them and you, you on the back burner.  And if these children can abuse you or take their mother's side or whatever it is, they're going to be allied against you.  You need to understand that.  Because that's the type of worldly mindset that these people have.  You need to know this.  All right?  You're never, ever, ever going to be their father unless they accept you as such.  They don't carry your last name.  All right?  And if they don't carry your last name, if they don't respect you, even if they don't choose to carry last name, if they respect you, you got something different.  Now let's go to the second contrast.  There are some women out there And they're supposed to love their children.  They're supposed to have mama bear syndrome because, you know, they're never, ever, ever not going to have that because they're mothers.  I mean, my mother's 81 years old.  And I'm, damn, here in a few weeks I'll be 54 years old and she still tries to mother me.  That's never going to go away.  You understand that?  That's never, ever going to go away.  All right?  But... On the believer part, there's no secret.  I'm a pastor, but I have literally seen in the ministry Women who have come to the faith, who have had two or three children, I've seen trash.  women have two or three children.  we have taken care of, raised, reared, schooled them, put time, money, energy, effort, resources, roof over their head, and leave here just as bitter and ungrateful and unthankful as if, and no thank you, no nothing.  And I've literally opened up my community and my home only to be rejected by these type of people.  And the beat goes on.  But then there are other women that come that have children.  And they realized that they were in a bad situation with something that seemed like it started out to be so good.  But they realized that they were saddled up with a piece of trash.  And I can tell you right now, these were really, truly, legitimately good women.  That's the reason why you can't paint a broad brush.  I've seen relationships where the mother puts the man first, even though she has children from someone else's seed.  And I've seen these families in a healthy relationship where the children love the man as if their own father and they love the mother and the father loves the children the exact same way.  I've seen it.  So you can't say that dating single mothers are always off limits.  You can't really truly say that.  And again, there's a difference from a worldly perspective and point of view and mindset.  And then there's a difference between those who believe in keeping the commandments and living a holy set apart, pure life.  I've seen women come to this and be some of the most honorable and respectful, beautiful, such as you ever seen in the world.  As a matter of fact, I've had people come here from Nicktown coming to the ministry and said, I've never in my life ever seen women like this.  And again, and they're just so beautiful.  And you know, when a woman is respecting you and honoring you and obeying you and doing what you tell her to, not because you're gonna abuse her or anything like this, again, it's the difference in mindset.  A man will literally bend over backwards to do whatever he can for that woman because she is in her role and he is in his role.  Am I making any sense?  But I tell you, if you're gonna approach this and you're gonna look at a woman from a worldly perspective and point of view, and where there's no litmus test for morality, who determines what is moral, morally right and wrong?  Who determines values and ethics?  Who is the one that is gonna actually truly lead this home?  I mean, If you can find a worldly woman out there that will allow you to take the headship, and when it's time for you to chase those children, she doesn't interfere, and you're not an abusive man, but you're just doing it out of the goodness of your heart.  Man, you found a Jew, but I wouldn't look too far.  I wouldn't look too hard.  You can forget it.  But even in the faith, like I said, anytime you're dealing with some type of structural relationship, marriage or commitment, you're always playing Russian roulette.  I mean, let's just go ahead and tell it what it is.  American champions itself as a monogamous society in every marriage that actually materializes and take place.  Be it a spiritual marriage, or that's what the world calls it, or a state marriage.  I thought it was in God we trust, and under God we got married.  See, it's double talk.  Anyway, either way it goes.  Are you following me?  It stands a 72% chance of failure as soon as you say, I accept and I do.  That's not good numbers.  That's bad numbers, as a matter of fact.  I got much to talk about, much to be desired.  I'll talk a little bit more about more intimate subjects like this on Patreon than I do on YouTube because if it's on YouTube, if it's on Facebook and stuff, man, the censorship is just off of the proverbial chain it is.  But hey, if you want to hear more about this, stuff like this, you may want to consider coming on over to Patreon and stuff.  There's a vast archive over there.  This is the skinny from my experience and being a counselor for over 25 years and living it myself.  And I think that my experience would actually While not having letters and papers and stuff, I think it's more valid than someone born getting a degree and never been in the experience of themself and trying to tell you the nuances of relationships and marriages and stuff.  I think the actual experience trumps papers and degrees and letters.  What say of you?  I hope I said something that will stimulate thought and will make you think very, very carefully.  Ultimately, the bottom line is a man wants a woman in this world.  That is going to assimilate herself to him 100%.  That is going to respect him, honor him, and love him.  I'm talking about a good man.  Because everybody in this world ain't good.  I promise you that.  And there are very few... Just like there are very few good men, there are damn so very few good women.  I'm going to end this on this.  I was just thinking the other day about the Tiger Woods saga.  Alright?  And how that went down.  And I was thinking... Man, this is unbelievable.  Unbelievable.  You know, you had quite a few consorts out there.  What is it about women?  that there's no shame and there's no embarrassment about the things that they have done concerning relationships privately?  That they don't mind spilling their guts.  And they'll even tell every little thing privately that they've done sexually.  And it could be true or it could not be true.  Because I'm telling you, I've been seeing a trend lately that women have been going out here lying.  And they come only to find out later on that they've destroyed people's football careers, basketball careers, sports careers.  All because they were bitter.  Unreal.  What a world we live in.  I just thought I'd ask that question.  Anyway, hope it says something to stimulate thought.  Y'all be encouraged, all right? ",
