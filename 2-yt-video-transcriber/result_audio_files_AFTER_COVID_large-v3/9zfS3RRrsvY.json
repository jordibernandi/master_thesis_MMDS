            "text": "So I have watched way too many hours of interviews with Donald Trump supporters who genuinely believed that he was going to be the next president.  And this is like from a week or two weeks ago, you know, after the Electoral College made it official, after Congress had already certified the results, you know, all that's left was Biden's inauguration.  And up until that point, there were still Donald Trump supporters, namely QAnon supporters, who actually believed that Trump was going to be sworn in for a second term.  And they look for little subtle things that they believed was a nod from Donald Trump.  So Trump would say, you know, there will be a new administration.  He said this in one of his videos, but he didn't say Biden's name.  So since he didn't acknowledge Biden, then perhaps he's referring to a new Trump administration.  Trump 2, if you will.  And, you know, the thought in the back of my mind as I heard them deny reality was, what are they actually going to say and do once Joe Biden is sworn in and you can't deny it any longer?  And a lot of QAnon supporters believed that on Inauguration Day, Joe Biden wouldn't be sworn in, rather.  Trump would impose martial law and Joe Biden would be arrested.  I think I'm oversimplifying what they believe was going to happen, but that's kind of the gist of it.  And according to what they're saying now, their reactions are pretty interesting.  There's still some folks who are denying that Joe Biden is president or that this is all part of Trump's plan now that he's sworn in.  But I am a little bit relieved to see some of them kind of get the reality check that they really desperately needed.  So I want to share some of the comments from QAnon conspiracy theorists who are really shocked right now.  This person says, well, I'm the official laughingstock of my family now.  Awesome.  I mean, you kind of deserve it.  This is an embarrassment.  Here come all the excuses now.  This person says, So this one is a true Kool-Aid drinker and doesn't want to admit the reality.  This individual named Sophie shared this from the QAnon casualties subreddit.  A Q mom was working herself into a heart attack.  This is shocking to me.  Her and her cronies are in such a tizzy waiting for the National Guard to come out and arrest Biden as soon as he takes the stage that she's literally having chest pain.  Holy shit.  I can't say that I'm even concerned at this point.  Wow.  To be that committed and detached from reality is just... I don't even know how to respond to that.  PepeTime says, fuck this sham.  I want to puke.  Fuck.  Praying.  We see some cry emojis.  He sold us out.  It's revolution time.  Trump lied and failed.  as simple as that.  So, I mean, like, I don't know if these folks think that Donald Trump was going to actually like arrest Joe Biden or that, you know, Q was just wrong or Q was right.  But Trump got cold feet.  But either way, they think that Trump sold them out, which is interesting.  um you see one person laughing probably a troll.  um and then this person says we were lied to by q and now we have to figure out how to move on.  this is what i want to see.  i want to see them realize that they were misled and they were duped.  uh this person says i am sick to my stomach.  we've been played.  so what now?  sad and confused.  sick to my stomach.  this person says where's the damn storm?  what happened?  why didn't the plan work?  i feel stupid very interesting.  uh trump fooled us.  worst day in american history.  i'm sick to my stomach.  i can't believe what is happening.  nothing to let out but disappointment.  So, you know, there's a lot of folks based on this.  I mean, this is a small sample size, obviously, but they feel embarrassed and stupid.  Some of them feel as if Donald Trump betrayed them.  That's the reaction that reasonable people, people who aren't too far gone, would express when they realize that they've been duped.  When you see evidence directly contradict what you believed, that's a good thing, right?  But you see some folks who they are incapable of fighting past the cognitive dissonance.  I'm not going to put this one up on the screen, but I'm going to read this, or some of it at least.  So this person is trying to rationalize why Biden was sworn in.  Trump is now stepping down, not in the way that you think.  He is allowing a smooth transition of power, not to Biden, but to the military.  This is exactly what he means.  Transition into martial law.  So Biden isn't actually the president.  This is a transition into martial law.  And I don't think they realize what martial law is and why.  that would be bad for all of us.  But this person continues, as predicted, General Flynn will be taking the reins here for a while.  You didn't hear during POTUS speech anything about Biden or conceding.  This is part of Nassera and Gassera, as he has already Step down from the U.S.  corporation debt entity into the new administration 1776 Constitution Party.  I don't think I have to go much further because this is going to rot my brain if I read anymore and rot your brain as well.  But some folks are still trying to.  believe that cubanon was correct and trump is still fighting for them and trump still has a plan.  trust the plan guys.  this i mean if you can't leave this then this is really sad.  i hope that most people react to this by thinking wow i was duped it's time for me to move on.  and um you know the thing about this conspiracy theory is out of all the conspiracy theories that i've heard of this is the dumbest one.  it's not even like entertaining like at least with illuminati.  uh there's some intrigue there right it's interesting like there's this big cabal of celebrities and politicians that are devil worshipers.  but this is more batshit insane but somehow less interesting.  Like, it's fascinating from a sociological standpoint, and there are questions that I want people to answer for me, like, about the psychology of these folks.  Like, I want to know how you get roped into a conspiracy theory this dumb.  But in terms of, like, the sheer entertainment value, QAnon is dogshit.  Like, it all relies on Donald Trump, and he, of all people... is going to crack down on pedophilia and this satanic ring of, like, baby-eating politicians.  Donald Trump has been accused of rape and sexual assault how many times now?  And he's the hero?  He's your savior?  It's just astonishing to me.  So, what I genuinely hope... is for most of these folks, because I know not all of them are savable, I hope that they come to reality.  Like the response should be, yeah, I feel embarrassed now.  I was proven wrong.  Now it's time for me to grapple with my mistake and grow as a human being.  This is not like something that is abnormal.  we all as human beings go through this at some point maybe not to this level and at this scale but we all find out that one of our beliefs was incorrect it was wrong and we staked a lot on it.  like for me growing up i was indoctrinated into religion.  i was an evangelical And, you know, learning that that was all a lie and it was wrong and there's no evidence that God exists, it really is an eye-opening thing and it really opens the door to you.  being more objective and impartial, I think, because you kind of question yourself once you fight past the cognitive dissonance.  You think, well, since I was wrong about this, what else am I wrong about?  And you kind of go on this philosophical journey, which I think is important for self-growth.  So I hope that that happens with these folks.  I genuinely hope that a lot of these people wake up and this is the reality check that they needed.  But some of them are going to try to rationalize it.  And that's to be expected.  Some of them are just too far gone.  But if a lot of people leave the cult and they wake up, I'm going to applaud that.  You know, welcome back to reality.  We've missed you.  But hopefully going forward, you know, you are a little bit more rigorous in the sources that you consume and the media that you digest.  Be a responsible consumer of what you perceive to be news.  Like if you see it in a meme on Facebook.  Maybe before believing that, just do a quick fact check.  If you hear it from some entity who is supposedly working for the government, but that individual presents like no evidence that that's the case, maybe question their motives, question whether or not more evidence is necessary.  Let's just try to be more responsible and have some common sense.  That's literally all that I could ask and hope for. ",
