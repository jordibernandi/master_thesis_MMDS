We sure as hell don't.  As\u00ed mismo.  As\u00ed mismo.  They gotta show us what they can do for us, what they can do for our communities.  We're not gonna buy the same wolf tickets and false promises that destroyed great countries like Venezuela and Cuba.  It's not gonna happen.  You know what else is not gonna work for them?  Playing Despacito on your cell phone to pander to us.  Hell no.  You gotta give us some credit for having heads on our shoulders.  I'm gonna wrap this up with some words of Barack Obama.  He said elections have consequences.  That is true.  And those words have never been more true than they are today.  We either re-elect President Trump and keep America great.  Amen.  Or we let Joe Biden destroy the greatest country the world has ever seen.  Now, I'm a professional athlete, and I've been one for most of my life, so I've always seen things through a sports lens.  That makes Donald Trump our head coach.  And before the global pandemic, we were winning Super Bowls.  And when you're winning Super Bowls, you don't fire the coach.  Doesn't matter if you don't like the plays he runs, the players he puts on the field, or what he says on Twitter.  You sure as hell don't replace him for another coach that's been in the business for 47 years at every level and never won a f***ing game. ",
