            "text": "Shalom.  This week's Torah portion is parashat Yitro, in which, three months following the exodus from Egypt, the people of Israel arrive at the wilderness of Sinai, there to receive the Torah from G-d Himself.  This parasha features many profound and important things.  The character of Yitro himself, after whom the portion is named, his pagan background and indeed idolatrous prowess which he abandoned to follow the one true G-d with great dedication, who he was, the advice that he gave to his son-in-law Moshe, the concept of the judicial system, the description of the character of those who are worthy to be leaders.  But unquestionably, the main event of the parasha is the arrival of Israel at Mount Sinai and the experience of the revelation, the giving of the commandments and the Torah itself.  This is an event of unparalleled spiritual magnitude, which changed the course of human history and verily validated creation.  There's so much we can discuss here, so much to learn about the nature of that experience, that brush with the Divine and Eternal, that every man, woman and child witnessed and internalized so deeply.  But permit me today to dwell on one particular aspect of this experience that I've always been fascinated by, But today I'd like to try and go a little deeper and try to understand the implications for us, for all of us.  Chapter 20 and verse 15 reads in Hebrew, V'chol ha'am ro'im et ha'kolot v'yat ha'lapidim v'yat kol ha'shofar v'yat ha'har ashan v'yar ha'am v'ya'anu v'yamdu me'rachok.  which is translated literally as, the entire people saw the thunder and flames and the sound of the shofar and the smoking mountain, the people saw and trembled and stood from afar.  The obvious question is, it's one thing for the entire people to see the flames and the smoking mountain, but how could the verse state that they saw the thunder and the sound of the shofar?  Not to mention who was blowing the shofar, but that's for another day.  Something that is accessible through the sense of sound cannot be associated with the sense of sight.  Sound has to be heard.  How could the sounds have been seen?  You may be wondering, does this have anything to do with the fact that light travels faster than sound, because the sound waves can only travel as waves of pressure in a medium, whereas electromagnetic waves of which light is made move on their own even through vacuum.  Sound speed depends on the medium through which it travels.  No, I don't think it has anything to do with that at all.  This whole idea is generally referred to as an example of what is called synesthia, defined as the production of a sense impression relating to one sense or part of the body by stimulation of another sense or part of the body.  But there are various differing explanations expounded upon by the great sages as to what's really going on here.  Some authorities maintain that the verse should be understood simply, that despite the awkward syntax of the verse, the plain meaning is that they saw what is seen, and they heard what is heard, and the verse simply groups them together.  Others defined the seeing as in the sense of understanding.  as used elsewhere in the Torah, as in Genesis 27-27.  See, the fragrance of my sun is like the fragrance of a field that Hashem has blessed, said Isaac, regarding Yaakov.  In other words, even when something is not seen but is conceptualized, the word seeing can be and is used, as in, I think I finally see.  In that case, the verse would be better read as all of the people perceived the thunder and lightning flashes and the sound of the trumpet and the mountain smoking.  But other great commentators explained this as actual sight.  They saw somehow in a supernatural manner.  They saw the sounds.  supernatural defined here simply as a manifestation or event attributed to some force beyond scientific understanding or the laws of nature.  This was something so high, sublime, so ethereal, so sacred.  The renowned commentator the Kleikar explains famously in these words, he says, Each word that was uttered by the mouth of the Holy One, blessed be He, immediately took form until the people actually could perceive the letters of the words of the Almighty formed in front of them, in the air, as if everything was written out before  them.\"  Posted, if you will.  Thus they saw those voices that they heard, in the form of letters.  So to summarize, some explain the aspect described here by Torah of sight as understanding, and others as actual sight.  Today some would explain this phenomena within the context of the research of modern parapsychology.  extrasensory experience, such as telepathy or glimpses of the future.  Extrasensory perception involves awareness of information about events external to the self, not gained through the senses and not deducible from previous experience.  So today, such phenomena is explored under laboratory conditions and controlled environments, and people who experience spiritual sight using what's called, commonly, the mind's eye, are examined in sealed rooms, or while dreaming, and when their descriptions match reality, the results of such tests would seem to demonstrate from a statistical standpoint, that information indeed can be obtained without the aid of the senses.  So where are we going with this?  Open up your heart in the deepest way.  Don't you understand what really happened at Mount Sinai?  What this revelation really was, or should we say, as we shall soon see, what this revelation is all about?  The Kaddosh Baruch Hu, the Holy One, blessed be He, is absolute.  It wasn't necessary for him to give over his message to the people of Israel through the aid of the senses, but through spiritual seeing and spiritual hearing.  Listen, our sages state that at the experience of Mount Sinai, everyone was whole.  They say, everyone was healed of all blemishes and disabilities that they left Egypt with, where many of the Israelites were maimed or disabled from the hard labor and cruelty of the Egyptian taskmasters.  When they stood at Sinai, they were completely healed.  How do you know?  There was no one who was blind, for the verse testifies, the entire people saw.  was no one who was dumb, for the entire people answered, we will do, and not one among them was deaf, for the entire people answered, and we will hear.  So, since no words to describe the idea of receiving information in this manner exists, the verse utilizes a mixing of the senses of sight and sound to convey this idea.  Now there's no scientific explanation for an extrasensory experience.  Why?  Because this is exactly where science stops, because the explanation is the existence of the soul, which science doesn't touch.  So while we live, our soul is connected to our bodies, but the soul's existence is not dependent on the body, and it continues to exist after death.  We believe, we are believing Jews, we believe that the soul is free of the physical limitations of space and time, and therefore the soul can experience manifestations of the acquisition of knowledge without the senses.  Indeed the great Ramchal, Rabbi Chaim Moshe Luzzatto writes that the soul level connection is called the sight of the soul, which is not vision, like the sight of the body, because this type of seeing is not the vision of the eyes.  So at the Sanei Revelation, the people of Israel reached such an exalted level, such a high spiritual state, that they actually transcended the physical limitations of the body, and their souls became dominant over their physicality, and they were able to grasp and receive that which was said by the Almighty, without the agency of the physical senses.  Indeed, perhaps this frames an ancient and somewhat puzzling statement of our sages in a new light.  We have been taught that, with each word uttered by Hashem at the sign of Revelation, their souls departed from them.  Malbim explains this to mean that their physical bodies were dividing between them and the eternal, and thus their souls departed, meaning they were able to divest themselves of their own physicality, and depart from their bodies completely, and they saw with an internal spiritual vision.  And when G-d's speech was concluded, their souls returned to their bodies and then they saw again with their physical sight.  So now open up your hearts again.  Actually, we've gone out of our way to explain how the verse should be translated and what these words really mean, but we haven't really been completely honest.  Because the verse does not state in Hebrew, the entire people saw the thunder.  The verse states, ro'im eta kolot, which actually means, the entire people sees the sounds.  In other words, the verse is in the present tense.  Not ra'u, they saw, but they see.  Our great sages teach us that this means, instructs us, that in every generation the potential for this experience exists.  It's a constant.  Even if on a very reduced level, on an individual level, at the Sinai revelation the entire people experienced it.  But G-d is infinite and above time, and His voice is still thundering from Sinai every day, as the Rabbis teach, and thus those words can still be seen by those who are found worthy, or rather, we should say, who make themselves worthy, since we know that in this world everything, especially spiritual acquisition, is up to us.  So Western civilization has ingrained us in all of us, a tendency to rationalize everything, but we are believing Torah Jews, and as such, the fact remains that the world, this world, is but a passageway that leads to the next world, and that the soul is the main component of who we are, of our being, not this body that we perceive with our physical senses that holds us back from perceiving the true nature of reality.  So once in a while Rarely, perhaps, we get a brief glimpse of something else, something greater, and we see without our eyes.  Once in a while, in a rare moment perhaps, we hear something.  We hear something without our ears, we see something without our eyes.  We are so bogged down with what we have been taught to expect of ourselves, and with who we think we are and our own limitations, we have given up hope so much.  On ever having a real relationship with G-d, it's a wonder we can even see or hear at all.  We need to learn to pay attention to the Torah's true message, and to the message of the timelessness of the Sanneh revelation, the great gift of Torah, the covenant the Almighty made with us.  We need to know that seeing the words is in the present tense.  To this day, we need to pay attention to our spiritual essence a little bit more, a little less Twitter, Instagram and Facebook, and a little more concentration on the words of the Torah that are constantly dancing in front of us, the perpetual post, if you would, of G-d's utterance that stands before us.  That's the real face, face of G-d, that is the real Facebook page.  You don't need an app to see it.  If you want to hear that voice, if you want to see that voice rather, you really have to want that, to really work for it.  We need to really work on ourselves to become real again, to be in touch with our own spiritual essence.  That's what the whole goal of this sign of revelation was.  And really, we have to want the Torah to be part of us, deep inside, to make a difference to every moment of our lives.  The Mishnah in Pirkei Avot states in the name of Rebbe, look at three things and you will not come to sin.  Know what is above you, an eye that sees, an ear that hears, and all your deeds are written in a book.  Commenting on these words, the holy Baal Shem Tov taught, in the future, knowledge will be revealed there will be no coverings, no concealments, and this exalted spiritual level in which the eye will see what the ear hears will be the reality for each and every one of us.  Amen. ",
