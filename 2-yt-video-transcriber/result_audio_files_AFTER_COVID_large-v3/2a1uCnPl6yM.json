            "text": "Shalom, I'm Messianic Rabbi Zev Porad.  When Rabbi Yitzhak Kaduri, the most venerated rabbi in the history of Israel, left a note to be opened one year after his burial that Yeshua, Jesus, is the Messiah, it shocked the world and it shocked Israel.  Who would ever believe?  that a rabbi in Israel would call on the name of Jesus, Yeshua, risk his reputation, risk his ministry, but he understood that the salvation of Israel is the most important thing.  He understood that the Scriptures and all the prophecies point to Messiah Yeshua, Jesus.  The note was put on his website in a decoded format, and when they read and saw that the note spells the name of Yahushua, or Yeshua, Jesus, They immediately took the note off his website and said it was a lie.  Little did they know that Rabbi Yitzhak Kaduri in his yeshiva, which is a ministry school for rabbis and Orthodox Jews, was secretly teaching to a group of his students.  that Yeshua, Jesus, is the Messiah.  Praise Yeshua, Jesus.  God brought these students to me in a divine appointment.  The first Rabbi Kaduri student was Eliyahu.  Eliyahu knew that Yeshua is the Messiah, but he didn't understand the full Gospel.  After months of studying together with us in the ministry, he accepted Yeshua, Jesus, as his personal Savior.  And since that time, we now have 14 of Rabbi Kaduri's students saved, and many, many salvations all through the land of Israel, as we continue to preach the Gospel.  Many years have passed, and Eliyahu, the Rabbi Kaduri student, has been going through a sanctification process with a lot, a lot of persecution.  He's been attacked by the Orthodox movement in Israel, Yad L'Achim, and the rabbinical courts, telling him that the Messiah is Schneerson Mendelssohn.  But Eliyahu always stands up boldly and proclaims Yeshua as King of Kings and Lord of Lords.  He is now also together with the ministry team.  We're continuing to use the evangelistic book, the rabbi, the secret message, and the identity of the Messiah.  The Bible is clear in Romans 10, 17, that faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God.  But Jews in general don't read the Bible direct.  They read under rabbinic interpretations.  So they have books that interpret the Bible and books that interpret the books of the Bible.  This is the enemy's way of getting him out of the word of God.  Because Rabbi Yitzchak Aduri was the biggest rabbi in the history of Israel.  We're asking the people in Israel, do you want to know what the rabbi said?  And they always say yes.  Let's show you what Rabbi Yitzchak Aduri said.  They read the revelation that he left to know that Yeshua, Jesus, is the Messiah.  They're drawn to the written word of God and the Holy Spirit opens their eyes and they're saved.  There is no revival without the word of God.  using the evangelistic tool, the rabbi, the secret message, and the identity of the Messiah, revealing the shocking information that Rabbi Yitzhak Kaduri left that Yeshua, Jesus, is the Messiah.  Join me here now as I talk to Eliyahu, the first Rabbi Yitzhak Kaduri student to believe that Yeshua, Jesus, is the Messiah. ",

Can you explain, according to the way you see it, why do you believe that there will not be a physical third temple?  He says, I believe that they cannot touch the Temple Mount.  If they touch the area of the Temple Mount, there will be a World War III.  He says that in the book of Zechariah, referring to Zechariah 6, that Yeshua is the one that will come and build the temple.  Hallelujah.  Eliyahu, what is your message to Israel, to Israel and to the nations?  I tell everybody, all the nations, everyone, that Rabbi Milubavitch is not the Messiah.  He did not raise from the dead.
