            "text": "For over 10 years now, I've been a dating coach for men, helping men go out there and meet amazing women.  Some of them get girlfriends.  Some of them get married and have babies.  It's all happening.  But the main tool I've been teaching for all these years is social freedom, the ability to go out there and speak to whoever you want to, whenever you want to, without fear.  I kind of discovered this thing back in 2009.  Maybe it was 2010.  So around that time, I was super into my pickup phase.  So I was blogging about it.  All I was doing was going on every day and running around and talking to beautiful girls all day.  That was it.  That was my whole life.  There was nothing else going on.  And so at some point, people were like, hey, man, you're, you know, you're hooking up with these chicks.  Oh, what's the secret?  What's going on?  Are you spending money?  You know, like, are you getting him drunk?  Like, what are you doing?  I was like, no, no, I just go on the street and I tell girls are really beautiful.  And I got over the fear and I just, you know, I just and they're like, but it's really scary and they might reject you.  How do you do that?  So basically, I started teaching these programs.  Job, job, run.  What are you, fucking 80 years old?  You're a young man.  No matter what happens, you just get to that place where you're like, actually, I don't give a fuck if they walk away or not.  I'm going to remain.  I'm going to protect myself.  And I care about all the other people.  Exactly.  That's why we're doing this whole day.  That's the whole point of it.  They're going to see you.  They're going to think you're an asshole.  So what?  That goes on.  Would you like to get a coffee or something sometime?  Yeah?  Do you want to trade numbers and see if we can do it?  Okay, cool.  But that first time where I was getting the students to go and actually stop a woman and be like, hey, you're beautiful.  I want to meet you.  What's your name?  They were freaking out.  It was very, very difficult.  And even if they were able to push through and do it one or two times, that third time would still be difficult.  The fourth time would still be difficult.  There was always this anxiety.  One particular thing happened.  And I remember the moment this happened.  I'm going to tell you the story.  I went up to Scotland to teach a course up there.  I believe it was Glasgow.  What part are you from?  Glasgow.  Now we're talking.  One of the students was named Woody.  So we basically, we met up, I think it was somewhere near his house with a few guys and I taught him some stuff.  And we were walking into the town center.  It was about like a, I don't know, maybe a 10 or 15 minute walk.  So we're walking.  And I could really feel the energy.  It was like a mix of like, excite.  You can imagine, right?  It's like, I'm in my pickup heyday.  We're all going out there to pick up chicks.  We're really excited.  So everyone's very excited, but very nervous because we're about to talk to beautiful women, right?  Everybody's like, holy pocket chick, what's about to happen here?  And so I just knew I had this feeling like, okay, I need to break this energy.  There's too much nervous energy.  We need to do something here.  And as we were walking, I saw a guy just standing in front of his house and he just had taken his big, you know, a big garbage can.  And I turned to Woody and I said, here's what would be funny.  uh, go, go up to that guy, pick that bin up and try and sell it to him.  So I'm basically like, yeah, you're going to sell it.  You're going to sell this guy's trash can to him.  And he was like, okay.  And he walked up and he did a great job.  He was like, Hey man, listen, I know.  Let's be honest.  You know, and I know you want to give me some money for this.  So what do you think?  Five pounds.  And he just started fucking around.  The guy thought it was hilarious.  So the guy was laughing.  Woody was laughing and he comes back and goes, Oh, that was hilarious.  But that doing that and fucking around a little bit before we actually got to the town center, it changed the energy.  And then when we got into town, it just became easy.  Woody was first.  He just ran off and spoke to some girl.  It went great.  And it was an amazing weekend.  It was a great time.  Woody had so many dates lined up.  It was ridiculous.  Later that night, I called my friend Marcus, who I've known for years, and he's a great, great old friend of mine.  And we were talking, and I remember saying this.  I said, dude.  I said... when you make people just get out of their heads and do something silly something where they can be judged and they take a chance and they relieve that tension and they just they just do something where it just gets into that place of like not giving a like they're laughing and they stop caring.  like.  you know that diffuses the tension and when you get a little bit of energy going that oh it doesn't matter what this person thinks of me and you just you just do something stupid.  that where maybe you'll be judged and it doesn't matter and you realize it doesn't matter and it's all just a joke anyway.  After that, going and talking to beautiful girls is easy when you don't give a shit what people think about you.  He was like, yeah, man, that's what it's all about.  I was like, yeah.  All of this tension, all these fears that we have, it's really just mind-created stuff.  It's just the ego mind coming up with all the survival stuff.  Oh, no.  You could be rejected.  Someone could think you're weird.  It's almost like on some deep level, the ego thinks it's going to die if you get rejected.  Back when we used to live in tribes of like 50 or maybe 150 people, if you were rejected by your tribe and they told you to fuck off and they kicked you out of the village, guess what?  You would die.  So we have this deep, deep, deep fear of that rejection by the tribe, by everyone who's around us.  If we get rejected, we're not going to eat.  We're not going to have shelter.  We're not going to have medicine.  We're not going to have access to the shaman or to the healers in the tribe.  You're out on there on your own in the fucking woods.  You're probably going to die.  So even though there's absolutely zero risk of death or anything, the only way to really, really, really know that, to know that it's okay and it doesn't matter what people think, is actually to put your ego into uncomfortable situations where it feels like you're going to die and you do the thing.  And on the other side of it, you're standing there just going \u2013 okay i'm not dead i'm not dead in fact.  oh what's that feeling?  i feel kind of free kind of good.  i've seen people students addicted to this.  i've seen students do uh do the social freedom for one day and then the next day we're like okay we're gonna go talk to women today and they're just like ah talking to women is easy.  we want to do more social freedom stuff because they're they're addicted to that feeling of freedom of invincibility when they get to that point of not giving when anybody thinks I'll be teaching comedy therapy and it's a blast.  This course will get you connecting deeper with other people and you're going to laugh your ass off.  It's really profound.  I've seen a lot of change from this course.  So click the link below and maybe check it out.  See?  But the fundamental basic thing that you need to know, and this is really what I realized that day and the core of what I've been teaching since then, is that it doesn't matter what anybody thinks about you.  The only person whose opinion you should worry about is your own.  That's it.  And when you really start listening to you, not your ego, not this voice in your head that's been trained by society to say, oh, you have to make this much money to be successful.  You need to be a doctor.  You need to have a big house.  You need to have a big car.  People have to respond.  That's bullshit.  That's programming.  You're not that.  You're not that voice.  You're not the thoughts in your head.  You're none of that shit.  You are a creator and you create your own reality and you can do anything you want to and you can talk to anyone you want to and you can express yourself in any way that you want to.  Only your ego will try and sabotage that because it wants to fight for how important it is and how real it is.  And it doesn't like you tapping into your heart, tapping into your soul on the deepest level and pursuing your passion.  Because when you do that, you're in alignment with the universe, you're in alignment with the creator and you can do amazing things.  It'll have no hold over you anymore.  And that's why it fights so much.  And that's why it's going to fight and scream and go, no, you can't do that.  This is crazy.  Don't do it.  It's going to fight.  You're going to feel the resistance that you feel when we give you your homework.  That's going to be your ego going, Oh, I don't like this.  I don't like this.  But guess what?  After you do the thing, you're going to feel alive.  You're going to feel free.  You're going to feel loose and it's going to be beautiful.  Fundamentally, that's where it began, and that's what we'll be exploring in this course together.  We're gonna give you guys some space, you're gonna see your ego for what it is, you're gonna challenge it, you're gonna have some breakthroughs, you're gonna have some realizations, and we're hoping by the end of this course, you'll just feel more in touch with who you are, more in touch with what you wanna be doing, more in touch with feeling comfortable expressing authentically what you want, whether that's speaking to who you want to or living your life more authentically, being more open and honest with your loved ones, with your friends, maybe with your boss, but really coming from that place of I know who I am, and I'm not going to allow me worrying about other people's opinions to stop me from living my truth.  So that's our goal for this course, and we're really excited about it. ",
