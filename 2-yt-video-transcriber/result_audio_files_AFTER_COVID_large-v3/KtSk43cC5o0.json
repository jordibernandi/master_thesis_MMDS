            "text": "Ladies and gentlemen, my name is Ivy Wayne Lindsay.  I'm from New York City.  I'm Stan Mallard, and I'm the world's number one Barry White impersonator.  I love you, Denise.  This is special to you.  You know what I'm saying?  It's special for you.  Thank you.  Here we go.  Hello.  Here we go.  You know, I'm a wedding specialist.  I'm the lead singer of a 15-piece orchestra.  Oh, you really?  I'm a wedding specialist.  That's wonderful.  I've been doing a limo for 20 years, too.  In New York City, I drove 5 million miles.  I used to do sing-along in a limo, just like I'm doing now.  I love that.  I love that.  But the women burned me out, you know what I'm saying?  They called me, left it right.  I had 12 hours here, 12 hours.  Oh, boy.  Here we go.  Hey, what's up?  How you doing?  I'm going.  Wait a minute.  Let me see.  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  Let me see.  Wait a minute.  Let me get this chewed in here.  I produce a TV show, so I'm putting you on my YouTube channel.  What?  Here we go.  Here we go, Denise.  Okay.  You can hold this.  Here we go.  Yeah, find it in my bag.  Here we go.  Oh, Denise, my love, my darling, I hunger for your touch.  Oh, baby.  Only time goes by so slowly.  And time can do so much for you.  You must cease your love with me.  Must be your love.  Must be your love.  Lonely river flows beneath here to the sea, to the sea.  To me, open mouth beneath to the sea.  Yeah.  Lonely.  I'll be coming home, diddy, please wake me.  Oh, my love, diddy, my darling, I hunger, hunger for your love.  Oh, Woo!  It's time to go back to the police.  It's time to do so much for you.  Do you love me?  Do you love me?  God's best do you love me?  To me.  What a bunch of ladies today.  She didn't know this was going to happen.  You are the best. ",
