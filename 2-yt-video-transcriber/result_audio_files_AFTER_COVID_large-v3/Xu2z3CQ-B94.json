            "text": "Hi, and welcome to another episode of Redeeming Truth.  We got a listener question that I thought deserved an answer for sure, and we want to be really clear on this one.  The question was, I have had dreams in my life that seemed real enough that they could have been from God, but I question them now.  I question everything.  I was brought up in the Mormon church.  They experienced and seek after these things.  because they're told that they can receive some personal revelation, divine revelation from God through dreams.  I know that deception is real and it can be foolish, and I've seen what it causes people to do and believe.  I also know that believers could have dreams too, couldn't they?  So would God give dreams or visions to accomplish his purpose or will in today's world?  It is a great question and a hot button question and one that in the end is gonna have some debate and there's gonna be people that don't like any type of charitable approach to this and there's other people that ",

And so the idea of special revelation coming from other avenues besides the Bible is completely looked down upon and rightly so.  On the other side, they get very, people get very agitated about this because this is their connection to God.  This is their relationship to God.  And so when you start to take that away from them, they react violently to this because you're taking God away from them. ",

            "text": "Well, let me read you a couple of stats and ideas from both sides.  So recently, a great friend, a dear woman, Doreen Virtue, who came out of the New Age movement, had a story about a dream or a vision involved with her testimony.  The thing went up in arms.  People were so frustrated from the conservative side saying, you can't have had a dream.  You can't have this, that.  So she took her testimony down and it was like, good, now you're not gonna cause anyone to stumble with this supposed idea that you had a dream.  So that would be like one side, very aggressive.  You can't even bring that up.  Nothing you ever... experienced is true.  And then there's other people who have done studies.  One person did a study of nearly 800 former Muslims turned Christians, and 25% of them in the study said they had a dream or some sort of experience in a dream where they saw a man in white or they saw who they didn't even know who was Jesus Christ, that he quoted scripture to them, and that they woke up and ended up going to wherever he told them to go or do.  And then they heard the gospel, they got saved.  They never had a dream again.  It wasn't like every night they were told where to go or what to do.  But this study showed that there are people in closed countries where the gospel hasn't, that have had experiences and are saying that they've had experiences.  And so on either side, there's gonna be a lot of debate And it seems like we need to take a balanced and biblical approach.  And so I threw together a little list, and we've talked about this already, but number one, whenever we're talking about visions or dreams or whether they're real or whether they're possible, we believe, number one, we should be sensitive to new believers and their experiences.  Wouldn't you say we need to have a sensitivity and not a knee-jerk response? ",

And so we wanna make sure that we have that in mind when we're talking to somebody specifically about this issue.  And so, yes, you want to be sensitive to that.

Get out of here with that.  You know, being dismissive is not helpful.  Number two, we should be discerning because a lot of people do make things up.  Would you say there's an element of deception because people want to elevate that I heard from God in a dream and we need to be discerning? ",

But there are demonic aspects to this too that we have to be aware of.  And so you absolutely have to be discerning.  And the thing that brings discernment is the Bible.  The Bible judges all attempts, all expressions of special revelation to tell us whether or not that is something that should be followed or rejected. ",

We want to confront, if someone says, hey, I had a dream, and you know, like Oral Roberts, one of my old faith heroes, said a 900-foot Jesus appeared to him and said, you need to raise millions of dollars, and if you don't, I'll kill you.  So he went on the air and said, y'all need to give or God's going to kill me.  We need to be willing to confront inconsistencies with God's character and these dreams, because like you said, there could be something demonic.

You know, it's like, we gotta know everything and we know our doctrine and we can exegete the scripture and we all went through seminary.  But is there a time and a place to just say, look, I don't know what you experienced so that you can say, but what I do know and point to the Bible. ",

The Bible says, for instance, absent from the body is to be present with the Lord.  So when you say that your dead wife or husband came and spoke to you last night, that didn't happen.  Hmm.  That didn't happen because they are with the Lord now and the Lord's not doing that with them. ",

So this is where I think we play off.  the last one is, you can say, look, I don't know what you experienced.  I don't know about all that, but what I do know is, and then we point to God's word because his word is a lamp to our feet.  It's a light to our path.  Speak to the importance of scripture.

            "text": "Yeah.  So we would say quickly that when it comes to the Bible, there are three periods of intense miracles and then hundreds of years of nothing.  So there's the Exodus and Elijah.  There's a 600 year span between that when there's no miracles going on.  Book of Judges, Ruth, like no miracles.  And then you have Elijah and Elisha and then Jesus and the apostles.  That's 800 years.  So most people that have had, who have been the people of God throughout history, never saw a miracle, never did a miracle.  They live just like we do, pointing back to God's work through miracles and going, see what he did.  So we point to the sufficiency of scripture in that sense, knowing, believing that the scriptures give us everything we need for life and godliness, that the dream does not come along and supplant the Bible at all.  If it contradicts the Bible, then it's not from God.  And if it comes along and compliments the Bible, then we go, okay, well, that guy told you to go talk to a pastor who gave you the gospel and you got saved.  Wow, praise the Lord for that.  And so we wanna make a distinction between the what's extraordinary, which is miracles, special revelation, and what's ordinary, which is the normal Christian life without miracles, without dreams, and so on.
