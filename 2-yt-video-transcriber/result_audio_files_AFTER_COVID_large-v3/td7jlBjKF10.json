            "text": "This is the first annual growth and development picnic.  First, I'm going to give a little history on growth and development, where it started from.  Growth and development actually started from a gangster disciple.  A gangster disciple started from a poor boy from Mississippi.  His name was Larry Hoover.  That was my father.  And as a poor kid growing up in the city, he was just trying to survive, and he took to First legal hustles, of course, you know, carrying groceries home with a little button.  He was always an entrepreneur.  He was moving groceries around with buddies.  He said he could get more money if he had more people with him, so he recruited his brother.  That was one of the first hustles.  But as being poor and trying to help take care of his family, He was looking at the people around him, the surroundings in the community.  Surroundings in the communities of people that were doing good was the pimps, the gamblers, the prostitutes and hood dealers.  So just like in every situation as it is in our situation now, as being a little badass kid, as he calls it.  He took to the streets and got involved in some street things.  Somewhere down the line, they started a gang.  And the gangs weren't first there just for illegal activities.  The gangs were there to protect their communities.  At that time, the white guys was the gangs.  They were coming to the community assault the black people in the community.  The police would come in and assault the people in the community.  So the gangs were made to protect the community.  But while you're protecting your community and you're trying to have things, you turn to other means of survival.  But at this point, there wasn't Gangster Disciples yet.  They were just gangsters.  There was also other gangs in the community.  And the Vice Lords was the first biggest gangs in Chicago.  Then you had the stones.  And then you had the black gangsters.  So in the beginning, the stones trapped the poop.  I'm sorry, I left out the gangsters.  He had his own poop.  They was gangsters.  But the vice lords, the Black Pea Stones and the Black Disciples was the biggest gangs in the city.  He always looked up to the Black Pea Stones.  He said one day he wanted to have a gang of that size because he wanted to be the one in power and make things happen in his community.  At one point in time, the Black Pea Stones tried to recruit him, but they wanted to make him just a low man on a totem pole, an ambassador.  And he didn't agree with that.  So, as life went on, David Foxdale, who was the leader of the disciples, he came in with the idea that if the gangsters and the disciples came together for one, well, he came with the idea of bringing them together as both kings, which he agreed upon, which shared the power with evil.  But it came with the idea that if the gangsters and the black disciples came together, that would take away some of the bloodshed and things that was going on in the community.  So when they came together, they merged and they formed the Black Gangster Disciples, which later became just Gangster Disciples.  But as Black Gangster Disciples, even at that time, They did all the marching in the community.  It was a chain of supermarkets that was selling bad meat in the community.  You know, they marched to shut down the supermarkets.  It was Martin Luther King.  They marched with Martin Luther King.  It was the lords, stones, and disciples that marched with Martin Luther King.  They were the ones that wasn't scared.  It was 80% of them, the guys from the community that was marching.  to march against the injustice that was going on.  They also had like a soup kitchen, and the disciples had a lunch place, and the gangsters had a breakfast place.  So the kids in the community come eat breakfast.  on 63rd one day, I mean in the morning, and on 64th, I mean at lunch time, they can go down on 61st Street.  Now that was the.  That was what was going on, because like I said, it was trying to protect the community.  Even though there was drugs and stuff there, it wasn't readily available or easily available.  Somewhere down the line, When the pastors and different community leaders and what have you, people that was in power became interested in them, drugs became easily available in the community.  And when drugs became easily available in the community, that's when all the love and loyalty fell apart that was made by unifying and becoming a big organization.  And as I made it to a teenager, He was looking at the fact that a lot of the kids that was coming to jail were my age.  And he was saying that something needed to change.  Like they needed to do something different.  So him and other guys started coming up with the idea of growth and development and making a change to help the community and be a part of the community and stop tearing down the community.  He came up with... came over to Grove and Development because the people were back down again and going to jail.  So Grove and Development was a new concept that was not a new name for Gangster Disciples.  I mean, I guess it is a change from the old concept to the new concept, but Grove and Development is not Gangster Disciples.  Grove and Development is the new Gangster Disciples with the old.  Under Gangster Disciples, It's criminal activities.  You know, you're trying to, you're fighting over turkeys, gang bang, trying to sell drugs, and we know for a fact that this has been done before, and what we see from all that is jail, premature death.  You know, nothing good is gonna come out of it.  You might win for a while, but usually in the end, you don't come out on top.  So the new concept was made, which was broken development.  The broken development was made to go back to the old from where they started, to be a part of the community, to save the kids, to keep us from going to jail, to keep us from leaving jail and coming back to jail, recidivism.  You know, it was... You know, he's wasting a lot of people.  They understood what the power was to have a lot of people together, and with a lot of people together, like when they marched before, that makes you a force to be reckoned with.  When we got issues in our community with the police and laws and things not working in our favor, having numbers and people behind us is how we deal with the situation.  You know, thinking that we are locked in in the box that they got us here, which is usually the ghetto, you know, Roken Development was put there to make an understanding for adults to pass on to youth to know that we can get out of that box.  That box is really a box on our mind.  You know, there's unwritten laws that we can't do certain things, and we buy into that.  Roken Development was to free our mind, to educate us, to make us aware of what's going on, what we can do, and how we can move forward.  Under growth and development, we can be a part of our society.  We don't have to be in hidden rooms in the back when it's time to talk and meet and discuss what we're doing because we're not doing nothing that's going to ruin our lives or anybody else's life.  You know, we, growth and development, was to make sure that it's not like it is now where you got to worry when your mother walks to the store or come outside of the house where your kids go play in the park.  Growth and development was so that we know that even if school wasn't for you, you can learn the trade, like we can actually make it in the world.  You know what I mean?  It was passing on the fact that we don't have to spend our lives in a box and wind up going to jail or dead.  It's for poor people all over.  We all the same people, whether you were a vice lord, a stone, of BD, of blood, of grip.  You know, we poor folks going through the same situation.  Whether you're a Latin king, you know, Mexicans or whoever, we all poor folks going through the same thing.  We at each other's throats for a piece of, a piece of death, really.  It's not even really a piece of life.  So, I'm working on how I'm gonna put this on, We'll just grow from vellum and put me out here so we can do the class.  We'll just go out and put it out for the world to see.  You know, it's nothing to hide.  They don't like it because it's changed the way we think.  We want to think differently so we can move differently, so we can move forward, be a part of society.  Have them people point at us and say, them guys came from this, this is where they at, and look what they doing.  We're not trying to hide nothing.  And every time something happens that's against the disciples, it's negative.  If you look up to Larry Hooper, he's being blank.  Y'all don't even know Larry Hooper.  He's responsible for all the activities.  They say there's against the disciple activities.  And he don't know y'all.  I mean, he's proud that there's people that still believe in him, but he's not responsible for your activities, although they say he's responsible.  You know, they know that he can't talk to y'all, but they still use him.  So he's a sacrificial lamb for your sins and what you do out here in the streets.  And we want to make his outlook be left the right way on the community.  I went to a banquet for some community leaders in Englewood, and all of them got up there and talked about And the legacy they was leaving behind.  I was thinking about my father's legacy.  And I don't want his legacy to be left where they're trying to leave it at.  I want it to be left at where he was going to with it.  Because they know for a fact what he was trying to do.  That's why they got him silenced.  That's why they got him in a cell in the basement and don't want him to reach out to the world.  So we're both in development.  We're going to try to move forward with that.  go to the LarryHoover.org and sign that petition.  We need you to pass that information along so more people can sign that petition.  You know, that stuff that Kanye did, as crazy as it was, it was real though.  He went and sat in front of the president and asked for him to be released.  And it still talks about it.  They say it's a process.  We don't know that nothing is going to happen, but it's a real thing.  And the more signatures and the more people that's behind it, the more they pay attention to what was done.  So as a family, that's what we need, for more people to get behind saying that we want him to be released. ",
