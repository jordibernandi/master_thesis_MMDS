The president said yesterday that that move is justified because President Obama targeted Flynn.  He called it, quote, the biggest political crime in U.S.  history.  Your former Senate colleague, Charles Grassley, has added that Flynn was entrapped and asked on the Senate floor, what did Obama and Biden know?  When did they know it?  So what did you know about those moves to investigate Michael Flynn?  And was there anything improper done? ",

            "text": "You never did nothing to nobody.  Well, as it turns out, Joe Biden actually did know a lot about the Flynn case, being that he was one of the people who requested he be unmasked on January 12th, 2017.  Which just so happens to be the exact same day that Obama came.  awarded him the presidential medal of freedom.  well i guess there's a price on everything.  january 12 2017. earlier this morning joe biden had requested general flynn be unmasked.  In fact, there's a whole bunch of big names, Samantha Power, James Clapper, John Brennan, James Comey, on and on, culminating with Vice President Biden.  Now, the problem with this is, is that they had no precedent to do this.  Here's the timeline of events according to the New York Times from a little bit from about 11 months after this all happened.  Okay, so it starts off that on December 28th, President Obama signed an executive order announcing sanctions against Russia for trying to interfere with the 2016 presidential election.  The executive order takes effect the next day on December 29th.  Well, right off the bat, this is an attempt to create discourse with Russia.  And literally, this is less than one month before you're out of office.  So less than one month before you're out of office, he is trying to drum up drama with the Russians.  highly shady and reason why this is complete bs is that now that all their transcripts are released we know that all of them under oath said that there was no evidence for russian collusion so they had no legitimate reason to think russians had hacked the election or influenced the election.  yet despite them all admitting under oath in private which i'm sure they did not expect to be released saying that there was zero conclusive evidence, no concrete evidence, nothing, one after the other, all amid this, President Obama still, still signed an EO announcing sanctions on Russia for something that they know didn't happen, okay?  So that right off the bat is ridiculous.  That very same day, Kislak then said, contacts Flynn, not the other way around.  He contacted Flynn in response to this, okay?  This is the Russian ambassador.  Flynn then apparently tells him that he did not want Russia to escalate, trying to calm the situation, which is what they're freaking out about.  I don't understand, like, what do you want him to do, start a war with Russia?  Like, he's trying to de-escalate a BS move by Obama a couple weeks before he's out of office, okay, if it even happened.  So allegedly he tells Kislyk that he doesn't want Russia to escalate the situation.  Then the next day Putin announces he's not going to take any retaliatory measures, okay?  So now, you cut down here to January 24th.  FBI agents interview Mr.  Flynn about his conversation with Mr.  Kislak.  He says they didn't ask him to refrain from responding to sanctions, okay?  We haven't seen the transcripts.  We don't know.  So he's saying he didn't remember the conversation.  And this is it.  This is why they wanted to throw this guy in jail, cost him millions of dollars in legal fees, basically ruined his life over the last three years.  All because... President Obama put sanctions on Russia for trying to interfere with the 2016 presidential election, even though everyone behind the scenes states invariably that they had no evidence, no evidence of that.  So a really responsible move here by someone who's about to leave office in a couple weeks.  Then they call Flynn, as to which Flynn then calls back and says, please don't escalate the situation, allegedly.  And then when they go and interview him, a couple weeks later, he says that he doesn't remember the conversation.  And they're saying that, oh, we know you had the conversation.  You lied to us.  Now we're going to put you in jail forever.  That's what this whole Flynn thing is about.  This is a complete hitch-up.  Furthermore, according to the 302s, Flynn says right off the bat that it was possible.  Flynn stated it was possible that he talked to Kislak on the issue, but if he did, he did not remember doing so.  How is this a lie?  And that's the point.  It wasn't a lie.  This was a setup from the beginning, okay?  That conversation occurred on December 29th.  Here's Samantha Power requesting to unmask Flynn.  November 30th, December 2nd, December 7th, December 14th, December 23rd.  All right, Clapper, December 2nd.  And then on the very day, well, the day before, December 28th.  Kelly Dugan, December 6th, December 6th.  John Brennan, December 14th, December 15th.  They were going after Flynn.  This is a story of someone being targeted.  And again, these are people, Samantha Power, behind closed doors, had this to say.  This is Mr.  Gowdy saying, All right, and I asked specifically about candidate Trump.  Would the answer be the same for those that were part of his official campaign but not the candidate himself?  independent evidence of collusion coordination conspiracy between the russian government and officials and official members of the campaign that would not otherwise be known by others.  mrs power again i am not in possession of anything.  i am not in possession and did not read or absorb information that came from outside the intelligence community.  yet she's got no evidence Yet before they're even in office, they're trying to get dirt on Michael Flynn.  Okay.  James Clapper, three requests, one December 2nd, only a freaking month after the election.  But behind closed doors, he was asked, like Jake Tapper and those guys, when did you first become aware of the late December conversations between General Flynn and Ambassador Kuslak?  Okay.  sometime after the new year's holiday it would have been the first week in january.  all right.  well then why were you asking on december 28th and december 2nd before the call even happened again?  this is someone who said under oath i was not aware to my knowledge of any direct content knowledge of collusion between the trump camp and the russians.  Yet nevertheless, they kicked these events into action, then had Michael Flynn contacted after he was already unmasked by half the Obama administration, okay?  Then bum-rushed him on January 24th that Comey actually is quoted as saying, we knew it was early enough, we could go in without procedure, that they just sent people in and tried to catch him in a lie, which according to the 302s, wasn't even a lie.  And while this whole entrapment scheme was going on, the news was doing what it always does.  It was praising Obama and running distractions so no one would watch what this guy actually did.  It was the same for his entire eight years.  I mean, look, that same week while all that was going on.  Here's January 17th.  Guy's only got three days left in office, okay?  These are the pardons he granted with just three days left in office.  Here's just stop at one.  Here's why he's a Coke dealer, a Coke dealer.  Here's someone was pardoned for giving false statements to federal investigators.  So think about that for a second.  While they were in the process of, quote, trying to get General Flynn to lie so they can prosecute him and or get him fired, which we just went over was a complete scam and they didn't achieve their goal of doing that.  But while they were in the process of trying to set him up for this, President Obama was pardoning James Edward Cartwright for actually giving false statements to federal investigators.  I mean, that is just insane.  Here's, you know, wrongful uses of coke.  Now, some of these, you know, I think there's way too many people in jail, so I'd probably agree with some of these.  You know, nothing that comes to mind right off the bat, but... This is what this guy was doing.  Here you go.  Most of them, a lot of them are coke dealers.  Importation of cocaine into the United States.  Tequila, moniette, love.  Pardon.  Here you go.  These are people importing coke into the U.S.  And so much more.  Here's a guy, bank embezzlement, health care fraud.  Oh, I thought Obama was this big bastion of health care, right?  Another one, importation of cocaine.  All these pardons.  Now, just think about it.  And, you know, that's not all his pardons.  They go on forever.  But just think about what did the news do when Trump made those few pardons a couple months ago?  They lost their mind, and they ran hit piece after hit piece on how horrible he was and how he could pardon these people and how insane it was, right?  Everyone remembers that, correct?  Well, just for a gauge, Bill Clinton, he pardoned, commuted, or rescinded the convictions of 459 people, okay?  George Bush, 200 people.  Barack Obama, 1,927 people.  To date, Donald Trump is up to 35.  35.  One of which is Dinesh D'Souza, Joe Arpaio.  alice johnson blagovich this is these are the few that they freaked out about.  okay so he's up to 35. that's how the news covers 35 pardons.  this is how the news covers 2 000 pardons by helping barack obama create the false narrative that russia tried to spy on our elections even though all of his people said behind closed doors that there was zero evidence of that.  but they instead went along with this Leaked that this conversation happened.  Even though they contacted Flynn.  And they had been targeting him.  Since long before they concocted their little scheme.  Okay.  Because that's what this was.  This was a scheme to try and set up Michael Flynn.  And all the while the news ran cover for them.  While they did whatever the hell they wanted.  They are two sides of the same corrupt faction.  The MSM and the DNC and the Obama administration were attached at the hip.  if we had real news in this country they would be livid right now.  they would be oh my god because that would mean that they got taken up by the hoax too and they'd be going crazy and they'd be sifting through these interviews.  but no it's got to be people like me sifting through these interviews because they refuse to because this isn't news to them.  they knew it was a hoax.  they are accessories.  they are the biggest accessories.  so they went out of their way to help perpetrate it over and over and over and over again.  And they're still doing it.  As these things are coming out, they're still deceptively editing things.  They're still getting caught with stuff.  Here's Chuck Todd deceptively cutting off Bill Barr's statement the other day to make it sound sinister.  Watch this. ",

Then, two months later, in July of 2001, the body of his aide, Laurie Klasutis, was found dead in his office with, surprise, surprise, no witnesses.  The coroner, who had already lost his right to practice medicine in Missouri for, quote, making false statements, first lied and said that there was no signs of trauma on the body or any indication of foul play, even though later he admitted that the body had a scratch and a bruise.  He then wrote off the two huge eggshell fractures bashed in the back of her head as happening from the fall because she had quote fainted from a weak heart.  Now, she was a 28-year-old marathon runner.  But don't ask Joe about it, because not only did he call ABC and different local media within hours to tell them that she had a, quote, complicated medical history, which the family then had to say absolutely not, and point out that she was in great shape and literally ran marathons, but he also apparently thinks it's a big joke.
