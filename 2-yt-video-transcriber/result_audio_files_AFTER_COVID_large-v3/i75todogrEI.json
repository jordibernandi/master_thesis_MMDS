            "text": "Well hi everyone and greetings from northern Michigan.  This is Bob the Science Guy and I have a treat for you today.  Now last week I put out the 10 challenges for the flat earth by Professor Dave Explains and I even gave them a simplified version of it because Dave seemed to have confused them a little bit.  Well, miracle of miracles has occurred and a flat earth scholar has responded.  So let's cue up the music and have a look.  Well, here's a hearty soul that wanted to throw his hat into the ring and respond to Professor Dave.  I looked at this earlier today, and it's really quite hilarious.  It's an hour and a half long video, so I'm going to do it in sections.  But I thought we'd just jump right into it and see what this young man has to say.  Now, just a little background on this.  Professor Dave Explains is a gentleman out in California that was a college professor.  Now he's pretty much a full-time YouTuber.  But as you can see, he's got quite an extensive playlist on a variety of subjects down here.  And in a little backwater afterthought... Down here at the bottom, he's got debates and debunkings.  And here he's got his flat earth videos and young earth creationist physios, and he's only got five of them. ",

That was the one that the globe busters foolishly engaged with, and their idiotic insult-filled commentary prompted me to make this little gem that they never recovered from.  Then, based on the ridiculous comments I received on that video, I made one more to mock the moronic things that all flat-earthers say verbatim.  Or at least they did, until that video made the rounds.  And then I put the whole thing down for a while.  It was never my intention to make that kind of content, but it was quite satisfying, and I got ten times the views of my normal content, which was a plus. ",

Then it had a rise in popularity as the latest conspiracy theory peaking in about November of 2017.  And then it had a steady downfall until the movie Beyond the Curve came out in March of 2019.  Now that caused a little spike right here.  And then the downward trend continued until there was an accident with a supposed flat earther trying to launch himself into space with a steam-powered rocket.  And then there was another little spike down here.  So while yes, YouTube did stop recommending Flat Earth videos to people that didn't specifically search for them, probably six months ago, that is not responsible for the lack of interest in the Flat Earth.  The fact that it's a silly theory and rather boring is responsible for the lack of interest in the Flat Earth. ",

We hear that it's just a scientific exploration, right?  A theory.  Several scientifically minded people working on a project.  But that's really not what's happening.  there is actually an us against them mentality, meaning us the scientific community and them the flat earthers.  And this is referred to as essentially the difference between good and evil.  So it's really not simply a promotion of scientific thinking.  The Flat Earth Movement is rather an expansion of ideology.  And if you're trying to expand an ideology, you're part of a movement.  Now at the same time as being a movement, it's also a conspiracy theory.  It's rare to find a Flat Earther who also doesn't believe in several other conspiracy theories.  So when somebody is a Flat Earther, If you talk to somebody like that, most of the time you're going to find they subscribe to a lot of other conspiracy theories, some of which kind of go along with the flat earth conspiracy theory.  A key part of it is this idea that the government is hiding information that would show the earth is flat.  Now, myth number two is that flat earthers are simply skeptical, right?  These are just individuals who are high in skepticism.  Well, scientists are simply skeptical, right?  Flat earthers need to believe the Earth is flat.  They're part of a community.  Skeptics are always looking to prove and disprove theories, and they're open to evidence that would serve to prove or disprove the theories.  Flat earthers ignore evidence that would serve to disprove the theory and accept evidence that supports their theories.  essentially a more extreme manifestation of confirmation bias. ",

He's also looked at the psychology of conspiracy theories and the Flat Earth movement as well.  So I'll put a link to that playlist of his in the description of this video because it's very informative.  But the important point is this, as we see with UAP, They're just claiming that all they are is skeptics looking for the unknown truth.  Of course they believe that the spherical Earth doesn't represent that truth because they're flat earthers.  That's their movement.  That is their cause.  And as Dr.  Grande points out, flat earthers refuse to accept or honor evidence to the contrary of their flat earth belief.  They have a need to believe in the flat earth.  That is a recurrent theme throughout this presentation by UAP.  They need to believe the Earth is flat.  They refuse to believe evidence that shows that it's not flat.  They put up questionable evidence to show that it somehow is flat.  But when you look at that evidence, it shows the curvature as would be expected.  The other thing that's kind of interesting about it is they're not afraid to make up evidence out of whole cloth.  And I'll be pointing this out as we go.  So let's go ahead and continue. ",

Why is it essential that we do have a photograph on Google Earth, which is a satellite-based mapping service, on the spherical Earth of some buildings at the South Pole?  We have ground level pictures of those buildings at the South Pole.  We have people that have worked in those buildings at the South Pole.  What is special about seeing those buildings on Google Earth?  Can you see every single building on the Earth with Google Earth?  Are there areas that don't have good coverage?  Yeah, I would say probably.  Now, more importantly, you make mention of the fact that you're just seeking the truth.  Well, the truth is, there's the Earth.  It's spherical.  We have pictures of it from space.  We navigate over it using spherical geometry.  We use sextants, which require spherical geometry.  Do you have any idea what latitude and longitude are?  Do you know why the equator is the longest great circle on the Earth?  Do you know why the equator is a great circle around the sphere?  Yet the Tropic of Capricorn and the Tropic of Cancer are both shorter in length than the equator is, and they are located north and south of the equator.  And we have two poles on the Earth.  We have a north pole and we have a south pole.  Everything works out that way, yet you feel that by questioning the reality of this spherical planet that we live on, you're somehow seeking truth.  Yet we show you evidence that the Earth is spherical, and you write it off as CGI.  You write it off as, oh no, that's just refraction, or it's compression, or it's skeeble lensing.  You don't accept evidence to the contrary of your flat earth belief because you have a need to believe in the flat earth to make you special.  That's all this is.  It's your desire to feel special.
