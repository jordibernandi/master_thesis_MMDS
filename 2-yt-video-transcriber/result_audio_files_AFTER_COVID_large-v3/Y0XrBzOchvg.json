One, it is about a teenage girl who goes on a European trip to four different countries.  Two, it involves a very cute boy with an accent.  Three, it is based on the trip that I took after I graduated college.  Four, I wrote it while I was interning at The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.  And five, oh god, what was five?  Oh, it involves Tumblr fan art. ",

It's currently one degree, one unit of temperature outside.  So I'll be inside playing video games, making videos because, well, the wife's out of town on Valentine's Day.  So if you want to be my Valentine, make sure you leave a like on the video and ask me in the comments to be your Valentine.  Now, many... in the past have tried to take on south park and none have succeeded.  part of the reason most people i expect or from what i've seen don't like south park.  it's because it takes shots at all targets not necessarily the right targets.  if you get what i mean south park has a long and illustrious history at just ripping on everybody and everything which is Why it's so great.  Which is why it hasn't alienated large swaths of their fandom.  Which is why it's the only thing worth watching on Comedy Central.  Now, many have tried.  Even China.  Do you remember back, what was it, a few months ago?  This article was in The Guardian.  where China censored all mentions of South Park because they dared to make fun of them back in October.  Now, in this article, it says South Park's creators have responded with a mock apology to reports that China has censored the program, ridiculing the country and comparing President Winnie the Pooh, the president to Winnie the Pooh.  I was just going to say his name as Winnie the Pooh.  uh the apology from trey parker and matt stone came after reports on monday that china had scrubbed all episodes clips and content related to the long time running comedy cartoon from chinese streaming social media platforms in response to a recent episode that was critical of the country.  the episode called band in china took aim what it portrayed as tendency in u.s culture to adjust content to accommodate chinese censorship laws.  it's not worth living in a world where china controls my country's arts as one character in the episode and It is so true.  If you look at modern day Disney, they're tailoring most of their movies to please the Chinese market.  If you've noticed, if you watch the pre-credits and the post-credits in a lot of these movies, you'll see a suspicious partner with a lot of these films called Tencent.  That's right.  The same company that is currently destroying Western video games, at least AAA video games, is also destroying our movies.  People become so obsessed with... The easy money that they can make in China that they forget they still have customers here, which is why cinema numbers continue to go down year after year and AAA titles that turn their love to the Red Sea or whatever you'd want to call it, the Winnie the Pooh land.  They abandoned their Western customers too.  Blizzard is a perfect example.  Do you not have phones?  And if we remember too, Vice tried and failed.  in September of the very same year, writing an article, South Park made it cool not to care.  Then the world changed.  That spectacularly backfired as well.  When they tried to basically whinge on for thousands of words, saying that, you know, the world's just better.  You know, you see that it's not funny anymore.  Well, again, another butthurt, one-sided person who just wants orange man bad jokes, but doesn't want things to go wrong.  all around you can see the article ends.  south park can never be what it was in bigger longer and uncut days because too much has changed.  today's most urgent cultural battles are less about top-down censorship what And more about the ways and nuances of policy language.  Representation can hurt historically marginalized people, in part because social media has ensured that these people are finally having their concerns heard.  Are you kidding me?  Pushing back against censorship is more important than ever.  This will never not be important, at least not in our lifetime.  I don't see.  It goes on to say.  Bigger, longer, and uncut.  The movie is a story about a bunch of people who start off caring about something they think is a threat, and then they get so caught up in fighting that they end up hurting everyone around them.  A lot of people could still benefit 20 years later from taking note of the movie's message, including Matt Stone and Trey Parker.  And the world not clapped, but laughed.  Now, last night... I noticed, or yesterday afternoon, I noticed that South Park was trending.  I thought, oh, okay, that's a spicy new episode or something.  And then Eric Cartman was trending.  I happened to click on the link.  And here we have a Disney Marvel employee with a nuclear hot take.  Yes, Dana Schwartz.  The writer of She-Hulk, you know, the show that's going to drive all those subscriptions to Disney+, all those, yes, slay queens who still have their dad's credit card for emergencies like coffee and ramen noodles, they're going to sign up for Disney+, for She-Hulk.  Well, she put out an interesting hot take, perhaps the hottest South Park take.  Yeah, it reads, in retrospect... It seems impossible to overstate the cultural damage done by South Park.  Cue the sad music.  The show that portrayed earnestness as the only sin and taught that mockery is the ultimate inoculation against all criticism. ",

To be clear, I don't blame the show itself as much as I do the generation of boys who internalized it into their personalities, which maybe isn't the show's fault. ",

            "text": "So South Park is such a problem, but only for men.  Only for men.  Remember that.  She goes on, this is so typical.  Somebody puts a spicy hot take out there, and then they immediately turn around and virtue signal and say they're being victimized by backlash.  So the very next tweet is, some very normal, well-adjusted South Park fans, which is okay.  One of the funniest ones is, don't be upset because you're a woman and therefore genetically unable to be funny. ",

Neon Taser goes, so I guess you learned to be smug and belligerent elsewhere.  And then you have stuff that's like, if you're offended by this tweet, I'm sorry that you're easily triggered.  Oh, that was her.  But you do get some white knights in the replies, of course.  We're living in a generation of trolls who don't realize carbon is supposed to be a joke, not a hero.  Bro, I really hope she sees this.  I mean, seriously, I hope she sees this.  But then, of course, DataRacer, at DataRacer117, compiles some interesting tweets from Marvel writer.  Marvel She-Hulk writer wants to cancel South Park because it's damaged our culture.  She's an SJW who wants to ban schools to ban books written by white men and abuses Star Wars fans calling them dweebs.  Oopsie.  So we see the original tweet and we can look at what Dana has said about them.  Matt and Trey are rich white guys and they've convinced a generation of scared, vulnerable young men that irony will never hurt them.  Hmm.  How about this nice little picture here?  You know what?  Screw it.  No novels by white men in high schools for the next 20 years.  How about?  I'm more scared of an angry young white man in trench coat than I am of ISIS.  How about?  I'm just warning you all now that the white man's guide comes out in November and I'm going to start tweeting some very provocative literary takes just because it's really funny to me when threatened white men get very mad.  And she's just using that to promote her book, which is called The White Man's Guide to White Male Writers of the Western Canon.  She posts a selfie of herself in a low cut top saying South Park fans on my Instagram trying to be say mean things about this selfie.  But like, it's a pretty good selfie.  Please validate me.  Please validate me.  Here's the picture.  I'm so above normal white people beauty norms.  But also, here's a selfie.  Please validate my beauty.  Dana Schwartz is a moron who's going to write a terrible show on Disney+.  And I hope everyone remembers that when it finally does come out because it's going to be a hilarious ride.  I hope you enjoyed this video.  We'll talk to you again real soon. ",
