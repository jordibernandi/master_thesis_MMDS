            "text": "As you know, there's a bit of controversy surrounding your OSU coach, Coach Gundy, wearing an OAN t-shirt on his private time.  And we reached out to Gundy and to Hubbard and we asked if they would sit down with us and interview with us, discuss why exactly Hubbard and the rest of the team believes that OAN is disgusting.  We'd love to have that open discussion.  I'm wearing this t-shirt to show that we'd love to have that conversation, a civil discourse, and the invitation is still open.  We're here until Sunday.  I work for OAN, so I did not even know we sold t-shirts until I saw Gandhi wearing one, so I thank him for letting us know we sold t-shirts, and we sold out, I think, three or four rounds of t-shirts at the headquarters, so they're now available for sale.  We've been... handing them out at the rally and people have been very respectful.  I think that they need to allow a university to have open discourse.  Open discourse is the foundation of a healthy society and if we are going into a society where what you wear on your shirt and what you discuss amongst your peers, amongst your family, amongst your friends, is suddenly something that you will be subjugated to intense, intense persecution, that is a sign of terrible trouble that we're facing in college atmospheres.  We cannot have a generation of people growing up in sidewalks.  And that's what we see in this controversy, and I hope that we address it going forward. ",
